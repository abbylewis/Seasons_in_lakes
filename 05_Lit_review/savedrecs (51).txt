The area suffers from seasonal hypoxia and cyanobacterial blooms despite reductions in nutrient discharge from the catchment and point sources. Internal loading may even dominate the P budget. Previous estimates of internal P loading have limitations (e.g., in spatial coverage and infrequent measurements). We present the first area -wide estimates of the magnitude of internal P loading based on the long-term release of P stored in the sediments. Modelling the internal P loading in the AS is challenging due to the complexity of biogeochemical processes in the sediment -water interface, as well as the heterogenic topography of the seafloor. Instead, we calculated estimates of internal P loading based on data from previous studies on sequential chemical extraction of sediment P, sediment physical characteristics (e.g., organic content, location of muddy seabed substrates), and nearbottom oxygen (O 2 ) conditions. The estimates in three scenarios of contrasting O 2 conditions were based on potentially mobile P pools in the sediments, recycled from sediment to water (i.e., loosely -bound or exchangeable P, P bound to reducible iron oxy(hydr)oxides, and labile organic P). The potentially mobile P pools were determined by chemical extraction methods (modified from Psenner et al., 1984 and Ruttenberg, 1992). The internal P loading under presumable O 2 conditions was estimated to be fivefold that of waterborne P input to the AS; comparable to previous estimates for hypoxic areas in the Baltic Sea. Our estimates revealed wide spatial variability in the internal P loading, depending on O 2 conditions and seabed sediment substrate. The site -specific P release estimates are included in a water quality model used by regional authorities, which increases the model's reliability for estimating the impact of human activities on the water quality across the AS.

QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The use of life tables in age-graded mandibles of the endemic pygmy hippopotamus Hippopotamus minor from Aetokremnos Cyprus suggests that death occurred by natural causes such as accidents, genetic abnormalities and endemic diseases rather than catastrophic causes. Comparison of H. minor and modern Hippopotamus amphibius life tables suggests the birth of one offspring per female per year and the occurrence of mating and birth seasons. Hunting by prehistoric humans whose tools were found in proximity with the hippopotamus bones is not justified by the life tables that have been produced. The use of the wet rockshelter of Aetokremnos as a living area during the day, in the same way that extant H. amphibius use lake water, is instead proposed as a probable explanation for the extensive accumulation of bones.

However, there are no reported West Nile fever outbreaks or epizootics in the country and only one fatal human case has been reported to date. Currently there is very limited information on the maintenance and the transmission of WNV in Madagascar and particularly on the mosquito species involved in transmission cycles. In 2014, we initiated a study to investigate mosquito species composition, relative abundance, and trophic behavior in Mitsinjo District close to Lake Kinkony, a WNV endemic area in north-western Madagascar. We collected a total of 2519 adult mosquitoes belonging to 21 different species. The most abundant species was Aedeomyia (Aedeomyia) madagascarica Brunhes, Bousses & da Cunha Ramos, which made up 83% of all the mosquitoes collected. Mosquito abundance was associated with proximity to the lake (Morafeno and Ankelimitondrotra). Additionally, a correlation was observed between the lake-side biotope and the abundance of mosquito vectors in Morafeno. WNV RNA was detected in one pool of Ae. madagascarica and one pool of Anopheles (Cellia) pauliani Grjebine, suggesting that these two species may be involved in the maintenance and/or transmission of WNV in Madagascar.					; Tantely, Luciano/J-1385-2019; Tantely, Michael Luciano/J-1385-2019	Boyer, Sebastien/0000-0002-2946-586X; Tantely, Michael Luciano/0000-0002-4658-6372													1252-607X	1776-1042				JAN 30	2017	24								3	10.1051/parasite/2017005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/parasite/2017005								28134093					WOS:000397709200002
J	Wooller, M; Wang, YM; Axford, Y				Wooller, Matthew; Wang, Yiming; Axford, Yarrow			A multiple stable isotope record of Late Quaternary limnological changes and chironomid paleoecology from northeastern Iceland	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We present results from multiple stable isotope analyses (delta O-18 of chironomid larval head capsules, chironomid adult thoraxes and other insect remains and delta D, delta C-13, delta N-15 of total organic matter-TOM) of a lake sediment core (04-SVID-03) taken from Stora Vidarvatn in northeastern Iceland to reconstruct past environmental, limnological and delta O-18 of past lake water changes during the Holocene. Core 04-SVID-03 represents a similar to 12,000 cal. yrs BP to present record. Large magnitude changes in delta O-18 occurred during the Holocene at the site. Downcore shifts in delta O-18 of chironomids did not correlate with measurements of the delta C-13 and delta N-15 of chironomid head capsules, implying that the delta O-18 changes were not primarily driven by changes in chironomid diet during the Holocene. The delta D of TOM provided a proxy of relative lake-water delta D changes at the site and also showed large magnitude changes during the record. This approach was supported by analyses of a modern training set where delta D-TOM analyses were conducted using surface sediments from a suite of freshwater lakes over a large latitudinal gradient. The magnitude of changes in both the delta O-18 and delta D and the relatively negative delta O-18 values throughout much of the core suggest that the proxies represent more paleoenvironmental information than solely temperature. Additional possible influences on lake-water isotopic composition are discussed, including changes in the seasonality of precipitation, in the patterns of air masses supplying precipitation to Iceland and in the dominant mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation.					; Axford, Yarrow/N-4151-2014; Wang, Yiming/ABB-3113-2021	Wooller, Matthew/0000-0002-5065-4235; Axford, Yarrow/0000-0002-8033-358X; Wang, Yiming/0000-0003-3228-5592													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2008	40	1					63	77		10.1007/s10933-007-9144-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9144-8													WOS:000257208600005

High rates of net primary production and turnover of floating grasses on the Amazon floodplain:: implications for aquatic respiration and regional CO2 flux	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												We investigated whether rates of net primary production (NPP) and biomass turnover of floating grasses in a central Amazon floodplain lake (Lake Calado) are consistent with published evidence that CO2 emissions from Amazon rivers and floodplains are largely supplied by carbon from C4 plants. Ground-based measurements of species composition, plant growth rates, plant densities, and areal biomass were combined with low altitude videography to estimate community NPP and compare expected versus observed biomass at monthly intervals during the aquatic growth phase (January-August). Principal species at the site were Oryza perennis (a C3 grass), Echinochloa polystachya, and Paspalum repens (both C4 grasses). Monthly mean daily NPP of the mixed species community varied from 50 to 96 g dry mass m(-2) day(-1), with a seasonal average (+/- 1SD) of 64 +/- 12 g dry mass m(-2) day(-1). Mean daily NPP (+/- 1SE) for P. repens and E. polystachya was 77 +/- 3 and 34 +/- 2 g dry mass m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Monthly loss rates of combined above- and below-water biomass ranged from 31% to 75%, and averaged 49%. Organic carbon losses from aquatic grasses ranged from 30 to 34g C m(-2) day(-1) from February to August. A regional extrapolation indicated that respiration of this carbon potentially accounts for about half (46%) of annual CO2 emissions from surface waters in the central Amazon, or about 44% of gaseous carbon emissions, if methane flux is included.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				FEB	2008	14	2					369	381		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01481.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01481.x													WOS:000253313400014
J	Yershov, P; Sukhotin, A				Yershov, Peter; Sukhotin, Alexey			Age and growth of marine three-spined stickleback in the White Sea 50 years after a population collapse	POLAR BIOLOGY												In the early 1960s, the population of White Sea marine three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a key forage fish, declined drastically, and the species almost completely disappeared from catches. The population started to recover in the late 1990s, and its abundance has increased exponentially since then. Using contemporary and historical data, we contrast the age structure of spawning stock and fish growth before and after the population decline. Most stickleback spawners in 2009-2011 were 2 and 3 years old, with the 3-year-old fish being more abundant. The proportion of 2-year-old fish in recent catches is higher than that 50 years ago, indicating some rejuvenation of the population after the prolonged decline. Moreover, White Sea sticklebacks in the present population grow faster than those in the 1950s. The observed shifts are concurrent with the long-term changes in the temperature regime in the coastal areas of the White Sea, which determine zooplankton abundance and the duration of the feeding season of fish. The variation in life-history traits among both anadromous and marine stickleback populations within a distribution range was examined. The stickleback showed a considerable interpopulation variation in growth, longevity and age/size at maturity, which appeared generally related to thermal conditions at the marine feeding areas.

Pink eggs and snails: field oviposition patterns of an invasive snail, Pomacea insularum, indicate a preference for an invasive macrophyte	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th Shallow Lakes Congress 2008	NOV 23-28, 2008	Punta del Este, URUGUAY					Oviposition of non-calcareous or thinly shelled eggs represents an important life stage of many insects, amphibians, and several gastropods. A recently identified invasive species of apple snail, Pomacea insularum, exhibits alarming invasive characteristics of high reproductive rates and generalist consumption patterns. This snail takes the opposite approach to egg laying compared to most aquatic insects as adult snails crawl out of the water to place clutches on emergent, or terrestrial, substrates. As fecundity best indicates invasive potential for mollusks, control or management efforts need to understand reproductive behavior in P. insularum to predict, and hopefully impede, its spread throughout the Gulf Coast of the United States. Specific characteristics of wetlands and shallow lakes may facilitate the invasion process of P. insularum by providing females with conditions that permit successful oviposition. In order to investigate this possibility, we studied P. insularum oviposition behavior in an invasive population at two times during the reproductive season in Texas, USA. Based on a subsequent survey (August 2009), plants comprised 78% of the available habitat. Wild taro (Colocasia esculenta) and alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) represented 48 and 43% of that proportion, respectively. During 2008-2009, no new concrete or metal structures appeared in our sampling reach and consistent amounts of plant stands and woody debris remained dominant. Given this distribution, P. insularum laid disproportionately more clutches on wild taro compared to its availability and less on alligator weed and bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus) than expected. Owing to limited metal and concrete substrates, we found a higher proportion of clutches on these artificial substrates than expected in both May and August 2008. However, artificial substrates comprised less than 2% of available substrates in the bayou. Our results suggest that wetlands and shallow lakes surrounded by large emergent macrophytes, particularly wild taro, likely provide ideal oviposition sites for P. insularum, promote egg supply, and possibly facilitate invasion into new aquatic ecosystems.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2010	646	1					243	251		10.1007/s10750-010-0167-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0167-1													WOS:000276660100021

Long-Term Agronomic Practices in Reducing Nitrogen and Phosphorus Loss from Intensive Croplands	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY												Eutrophication is increasing with intensive agricultural activities as a global environmental challenge, especially in developing countries. In order to establish the effects of long-term reducing fertilization and straw returning on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss in surface runoff due to intensive cultivation in the Yangtze River basin, China, we conducted a 7-year field pilot experiment with rice-wheat rotation in the fifth largest fresh water lake basin. The treatments included no fertilization by 30% (70%N), P reduction by 50% (50%P), and N reduction by 30% and P reduction by 50% + straw returning (70%N50%P+Straw). Results showed that the average wheat yields in reducing fertilizer treatments (70%N, 50%P, and 70%N50%P+Straw) slightly decreased by 1.21%, 5.26%, and 1.17%, respectively, compared to those with the optimized fertilizer, whereas average rice yields slightly increased by 3.71%, 0.64%, and 1.23%, respectively. However, the reducing fertilizer treatments (70% N50%P+Straw) significantly reduced the loss of N and P in surface runoff compared with Conv. Fert. and Optim. Fert. Total P and dissolved P in surface runoff water in rice seasons was predictable and modeled. The annual average N, P, and K fertilizer efficiency for rice-wheat rotation ranged in 21%-42%, 12%-38%, and 35%- 53%, respectively. Considering the yields of rice and wheat along with eco-environmental benefits of reducing N and P loss in surface water, 70%N50%P+Straw treatment was the best treatment for Chaohu region. This long-term field study recommends the employment of the reduced chemical fertilizer by 30% N and 50% P in Chaohu basin for rice and wheat crops with the maximum reduction of runoff N and P and the highest fertilizer (N and P) efficiency with reasonable high crop yields. This is especially important for farmers in developing countries in achieving economical, ecological, and environmental benefits in sustainable modern agriculture to feed the increasing global populations.

The physico-chemical factors of water and biological processes determine the quality of water which in turn indicates the diversity of fauna and flora that the water would support. However, the ecological factors of lake correlating with parasitic isopods under natural conditions are poorly understood. The aim of this study were: i) assessment of monthly variations in water quality parameters of lake, identification and determination of parasitic Isopod burden (Aegidae: Alitropus typhus) on freshwater fishes, iii) impact of water quality parameters in relation to parasitic isopod infestation in freshwater fishes of Chashma Lake, northwest of Pakistan. The results indicated identification of Alitropus typus, which was observed on majority of fresh water fishes namely: Labeo calbasu, Labeo rohita, Cyprinus carpio, Labeo gonius, Crossocheilus lalius, Cirrhinus mrigala, Notopterus notopterus, Wallago attu, Ompok pabda, Sperata sarwari, Chana marulius, Chanda baculis, Xenentodon cancilla, Gudusia chapra and Puntius sophore. The correlation matrix showed perfect significant (p<0.05) association between water temperature, hardness, free CO2 and conductivity. The linear regression model was applied between water quality parameters and isopod infestation, negative trend was observed for turbidity, DO, free CO2, alkalinity and hardness, while positive trend for water temperature, pH, water clarity and ammonia. On the basis of biological productivity, the lake has been categorized as mesotrophic to hypereutrophic in different seasons. The findings suggested that deterioration of water quality with changing seasons resulted to high stress response in fishes making them vulnerable to parasitic infections. Due to the presence of Alitropus typus on majority of freshwater fishes, we are also able to make the judgment that these Isopods have less host specificity. However, further studies on fish parasitological research, disease control and maintenance of health relationship between fishes and water quality parameters should be needed to implement in tropical lakes.

Otolith microchemistry reveals spatio-temporal heterogeneity of natal sources and inter-basin migrations of Chinook salmon in Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Chinook salmon fishery in Lake Huron is comprised of approximately 20% hatchery-reared fish and 80% fish from wild populations. However, finer-scale stock composition remains poorly understood because of the lack of lake-wide research and monitoring of this species and logistical constraints of mass-marking wild fish. This lack of information has resulted in a common assumption made by management agencies and used in fisheries models of a homogeneous mixture of hatchery and wild populations in the fishery. Using otolith microchemistry (multi-element concentrations and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic ratios), we identified natal sources of Chinook salmon opportunistically sampled through space and time in the 2008 and 2010 recreational fisheries. Our findings demonstrated extensive spatio-temporal variability in sample composition, providing the first direct evidence of heterogeneous mixing of hatchery and wild populations in the fishery. Our data also suggest that >90% of all fish in the recreational fishery originate in rivers and hatcheries in Southern Georgian Bay (46%) and Northern Lake Huron (46%). The majority of wild fish appear to originate from rivers in Southern Georgian Bay (55%) and Northern Lake Huron (35%); whereas the majority (67%) of hatchery fish appear to originate from Michigan hatcheries. Analysis of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios suggests that <1% of the fish originated from Canadian Shield rivers east of the St. Marys River. Our results fill in critical knowledge gaps for fisheries management of introduced Pacific salmonids in Lake Huron and other Laurentian Great Lakes.

Biogeochemistry of Ethanol and Acetaldehyde in Freshwater Sediments	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												This study reports the first ethanol and acetaldehyde measurements in sediment porewaters collected at multiple freshwater locations. Ethanol concentrations ranged from 11 to 2535 nM and acetaldehyde concentrations ranged from 6 to 320 nM. A significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) was observed between ethanol concentrations and the percent organic carbon content of sediments (TOC). Porewater depth profiles at two sites within the same lake indicated potential diffusion of ethanol into sediments from the overlying water at a lower TOC site and upwards diffusion from sediment into the water column at a higher TOC site. Diffusion of water column ethanol into sediments was observed at individual sites from October to January, whereas the opposite was true from June to August indicating the seasonal variability of ethanol flux from sediments. Changes in ethanol concentrations during a long-term sediment incubation experiment showed an inverse relation with acetaldehyde concentrations. The lack of a quantitative conversion was likely due to other sources and sinks that control their abundance. Our study provided new information on the biogeochemistry of ethanol in freshwater sediments and shed light on the potential role of ethanol in the global carbon cycle.					; mead, ralph/AAI-6687-2020; felix, joseph/JNE-1399-2023	Roebuck, Jesse/0000-0002-8575-2572; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				JUN	2016	22	3					177	195		10.1007/s10498-015-9284-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-015-9284-9													WOS:000376579000001

Do trans-Pacific air masses deliver PBDEs to coastal British Columbia, Canada?	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												In order to distinguish between 'local' and 'background' sources of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in coastal British Columbia (Canada) air, we collected samples from two sites: a remote site on western Vancouver Island, and a near-urban site in the Strait of Georgia. Seasonally-integrated samples of vapor, particulate, and rain were collected continuously during 365 days for analysis of 275 PCB and PBDE congeners. While deposition of the legacy PCBs was similar at both sampling sites, deposition of PBDEs at the remote site amounted to 42% (10.4 mg/ha/year) of that at the near-urban site. Additional research into atmospheric circulation in the NE Pacific Ocean will provide more insight into the transport and fate of priority pollutants in this region, but trans-Pacific delivery of PBDEs to the west coast of North America may underlie in part our observations. For example, approximately 40% of >12,000 ten-day back trajectories calculated for the remote site originated over Asia, compared to only 2% over North America.

Herein, we characterized the multi-mediums distribution of 63 ECs in Baiyangdian Lake, the biggest urban lake in the North of China. We identified variations in the seasonal patterns of aquatic EC levels, which decreased in water and increased in sediment from wet to dry seasons. Surprisingly, higher concentrations and a greater variety of ECs were detected in reeds than in aquatic animals, indicating that plants may contribute to the transferring of ECs. Source analysis indicated that human activity considerably affected the distribution and risk of ECs. The dietary risk of ECs is most pronounced among children following the intake of aquatic products, especially with a relatively higher risk associated with fish consumption. Besides, a comprehensive scoring ranking method was proposed, and 9 ECs, including BPS and macrolide antibiotics, are identified as prioritized control pollutants.

To address this research gap, the present nine-year field trial explored the co-effects of straw returning and chemical fertilization on soil total OC (TOC), dissolved OC (DOC), resistant OC (ROC), easily oxidative OC (EOC), as well as soil aggregate size composition of different soil depths (0-15, 15-30, and 30-50 cm) in a paddy field, East China. To do so, four different treatments were set up, including no straw returning plus no fertilization (CK), conventional fertilization (F), straw returning plus conventional fertilization (SF), and straw returning plus 80 % conventional fertilization (SDF). Our findings revealed that the >2 mm aggregates were dominant in all treatments, particularly in SF and SDF 0-30 cm soil layers ranging from 62 to 70 % (P < 0.05). The highest TOC contents happened in SF topsoil 0.25-2 mm aggregates (0-30 cm; 21.4 g/kg), 44.4 and 21.1 % higher than the CK and F treatments, respectively (P < 0.05). Regardless of soil depth, the highest EOC contents occurred in SDF 0.25-2 mm aggregates varying from 2.36 +/- 0.1 to 7.7 +/- 0.57 g/kg (P < 0.05). Further, the highest ROC and DOC contents took place in SF 0.25-2 mm and SF > 2 mm aggregates, respectively, differing from 3.86 to 15.8 g/kg and 250-413 mg/kg, respectively (P < 0.05). It is also worth noting that SF had the highest crop productivity with the seasonal yields of 3.51 and 13.5 t ha(-1) for rapeseed and rice, respectively (P < 0.05). Altogether, our findings suggested that long-term straw returning coupled with conventional (SF) or 80 % conventional (SDF) fertilization are the most efficient schemes for the formation/stability of soil aggregates, as well as for the accumulation of different soil OC fractions and crop productivity in the Chaohu Lake agricultural soils of East China.																				2405-8440				JUN 15	2024	10	11							e32392	10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32392		JUN 2024						38947469					WOS:001252071400001

The accumulation of cadmium. lead. copper. iron and zinc was higher in the digestive glandsof clams collected from the MCA and the HCA than in those from the ICA, particularly during the warm season. Our results reveal that metallothionein, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation levels and antioxidant defence systems were higher, while acetylcholinesterase activity was lower, in clams from the MCAand HCA than in those from the LCA. The results also indicate that clams from the MCA and the HCA are characterized by histological alterations and DNA damage. In conclusion, the evident changes of antioxidant defence systems and macromolecules between the studied lagoons reveal the perturbation of the physiological states of clams from polluted sites that cope with seasonal changes and trace element accumulations.

They support fast-growing annual herbs with a ruderal strategy. To optimize their recruitment success, seeds of mudflat species germinate better under fluctuating temperatures, full illumination and aerobic environments that indicate the presence of optimal (non-flooded) conditions for plant growth and development. Here, we hypothesize that prior exposure of mudflat seeds to hypoxic (flooded) environment interferes with the germination process and results in more vigorous germination once aerobic conditions are regained. To test this hypothesis, seeds of five mudflat species were incubated in both aerobic and hypoxic environments at four (14/6, 22/14, 22/22 and 30/22 degrees C) temperature regimes, reflecting different (seasonal) conditions when drawdowns may occur. All species responded positively to four temperature regimes; however, moderate 22/14 and 22/22 degrees C temperatures were optimum for high percentages and rates (speed) of seed germination. Since seeds of four species germinated exclusively under aerobic conditions, they were moved from hypoxic to aerobic conditions. Prior exposure of seeds to hypoxic environment facilitated high percentages, rates and synchronization of germination of Limosella aquatica, Peplis portula and Samolus valerandi seeds compared to incubation under strict aerobic conditions. However, prior exposure to hypoxic environment induced secondary dormancy in non-dormant seeds of Hypericum humifusum but broke dormancy in Lythrum hyssopifolia seeds that otherwise required cold stratification to overcome physiological dormancy. All species that have a narrow ecological niche (strictly occurring in mudflat habitats) showed positive responses to prior exposure to hypoxic environments. In contrast, H. humifusum that has a wide ecological niche (from mudflats to moist sandy grasslands) showed a negative response. We conclude that the hypoxic environment may strongly affect seed germination behaviour once the aerobic environment is regained. The most striking effect is the acceleration of the germination process and, therefore, life cycle supporting the survival in an ephemeral habitat.

Spatial and temporal variations of Limnothrissa miodon stocks and their stability in Lake Kivu	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Limnothrissa miodon is a small pelagic clupeid that was introduced into Lake Kivu in the late 1950s to fill an empty niche. Since then, it has become the main fishery in the lake. The fish stocks were estimated by hydroacoustics between 2012 and 2018 to provide information on the fishery in the current context of changing environmental factors. The main objectives were to determine the most appropriate season for assessing stock dynamics, to characterize temporal and spatial distribution in L. miodon populations and to compare with previous surveys to help predict status of its stocks. The fish size distribution showed that the long dry season was the most appropriate season for assessing the stocks, as it provides information of recruitment for the year. The south and west basins always had higher densities (1.23 m(2)/ha) and biomass (21-22.7 kg/ha) than the north basins (0.62-0.77 m(2)/ha; 15.3-16.5 kg/ha). The stock showed declining trend from 7,000 t in 1985 to 1,000 t in 2012 and thereafter consistently increased to 4,000 t in 2018. This last value is similar to previous estimates of 1990s and 2008, showing that the stocks of L. miodon are stable. The low 2012 values could be due to particular environmental conditions in 2012-2014, when there was a shift from diatoms and cyanobacteria to green algae. There is therefore a need to combine high-quality environmental data with fishery surveys to better understand the dynamic of fish and fishery especially under the increasing influence of climate change on lake productivity processes.

J	Jonsson, A; Karlsson, J; Jansson, M				Jonsson, A; Karlsson, J; Jansson, M			Sources of carbon dioxide supersaturation in clearwater and humic lakes in northern Sweden	ECOSYSTEMS												Partial pressure (pCO(2)) and flux to the atmosphere of carbon dioxide (CO2) were studied in northern alpine and forest lakes along a gradient of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content (0.4-9.9 mg L-1). Sixteen lakes were each sampled three times over the course of the ice-free season, and an additional 35 lakes were sampled once at midsummer. pCO(2) data were acquired in the field by a headspace equilibration technique. Most lakes were supersaturated with CO2 along the entire DOC gradient, with relatively small seasonal differences. pCO(2) was positively correlated to DOC content, reflecting a close dependence between allochthonous DOC in-put and heterotrophic respiration in the lakes. Fluxes of CO2 to the atmosphere were estimated from the pCO(2) measurements. Benthic respiration was indicated to be important for CO2 emission in lakes with high DOC concentrations. In lakes with low DOC concentrations, pelagic mineralization alone was sufficient to account for a large part of the estimated fluxes.																			1432-9840					APR	2003	6	3					224	235		10.1007/s10021-002-0200-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-002-0200-y													WOS:000183001600003

Activity budget and foraging patterns of Nubian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis) in Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The activity budget of giraffe in various African populations has been studied extensively, revealing that it is affected by body size, foraging patterns, and sex. Foraging patterns show an animal's feeding choices in its environment and are influenced by resource availability, competition, and predation risk. The ability of giraffe to survive and reproduce is significantly impacted by the variation in activity budget and foraging across different ecosystems. Our study focused on evaluating the seasonal activity budgets and foraging patterns of Nubian giraffe in Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya. We used the scan sampling method to record the activity budget of giraffe which included foraging, movement, resting, and drinking water. We then evaluated if activities varied with the seasons. A total of 11,280 activities were documented, with 4560 (40.4%) occurring during the dry season and 6720 (59.6%) during the wet season. Foraging accounted for 53% of the time budget during the dry season, but increased to 57% during the wet season. There was a slight drop in records of movement (22%; n = 995 of 4560) and resting (25%; n = 1145 of 4560) from the dry season to the wet season (20%; n = 1375 out of 6720 and 22%; n = 1515 of 6720). During the dry season, females (53%) foraged longer than males (47%), whereas males (44%) had longer resting periods than females (56%). Giraffe frequently fed on Vachellia xanthophloea (67%; n = 4136 of 6215 foraging records), Maytenus senegalensis (19%), and Solanum incanum (9%) over both seasons. Overall, seasons had little impact on giraffe activity time budgets and foraging patterns in Lake Nakuru National Park. A better insight into the behavioural patterns of this subspecies will allow managers to enhance the protection and conservation of the species and its habitat. Heavy foraging on Vachellia by giraffe at LNNP has been associated with a population decline in number, so perhaps planting more of this species in LNNP could promote a rebound in numbers.					; Gitau, Consolata/IQW-0113-2023	GITAU, CONSOLATA/0000-0003-2112-9180; Muneza, Arthur/0000-0002-2128-1820													2045-7758					JUN	2024	14	6							e11463	10.1002/ece3.11463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11463								38826174					WOS:001235814600001

Aiming to fill this gap, a comprehensive study was conducted during dry and wet seasons to assess the spatiotemporal water pollution of Beira Lake, employing key physicochemical parameters, numerical indices, and remote sensing analysis. The water pollution index (WPI) results categorize Beira Lake as highly polluted, with WPI values ranging from 2.38 +/- 0.92 in the wet season to 2.53 +/- 1.32 in the dry season. Comparatively higher COD levels recorded in the Beira Lake network, especially for Gangarama Lake show significant pollution levels during both the dry and wet seasons, e.g., the highest COD levels, at 306.40 mg/L, were observed during the wet season. The Trophic State Index (TSI) results indicate eutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions in Beira Lake, which are particularly pronounced during the wet season. The heavy metal pollution index (HPI) results suggest elevated heavy metal concentrations in Beira Lake, especially in the wet season. Combined with field investigation results, a remote sensing data analysis between 2016 and 2023 reveals significant improvements in water transparency, suggesting positive effects of recent management interventions. Parameters demanding attention include COD, nitrate, and total phosphate levels due to their consistent exceedance of permissible limits. The PCA results of indices correlations between wet and dry seasons offer valuable insights into the complex dynamics of Beira Lake's water quality. The study makes recommendations for restoring Beira Lake, including stringent pollution controls, regular dredging, green infrastructure implementation, implementing new rules and regulations, and community engagement.

Did central Australian megafaunal extinction coincide with abrupt ecosystem collapse or gradual climate change?	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim In central Australia, the giant flightless bird Genyornis newtoni disappeared about 4550 thousand years ago (ka). It has been reported that coincident with this extinction the carbon isotopic composition of preserved eggshells of the extant emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) shows an abrupt dietary shift from tropical grasses (C4 photosynthesis) to temperate grasses and/or woody browse (C3 photosynthesis). This abrupt shift has been interpreted as signalling ecosystem collapse due to landscape burning by humans. We evaluate an alternative interpretation, that the shift in diet was not abrupt, but gradual, and caused by the weakening of the Australian monsoon. Location Lake Eyre, central Australia. Methods We re-analysed a large, published dataset of emu diet delta C-13 (inferred from delta C-13 of preserved eggshells) spanning the last 140,000 years, using time-series analysis. Using Akaike's information criterion, we compared two contrasting models: (1) there was an abrupt shift in delta C-13 coincident with the extinction of Genyornis, assumed 47.5 ka; and (2) there was a gradual shift in delta C-13, correlated with reconstructed water level in Lake Eyre, a proxy for monsoon intensity. Results There was little evidence of an abrupt shift in emu diet delta C-13 about 45-50 ka, but delta C-13 appeared to steadily decrease between about 80 and 30 ka. Indeed, the model representing a correlation between delta C-13 and lake level was more than seven times more likely than the model representing an abrupt shift at 47.5 ka. Main conclusions The emu eggshell isotopic record from Lake Eyre does not support the hypothesis that landscape burning by humans transformed a savanna-grassland mosaic into the modern desert scrub, contributing to the extinction of Genyornis. While our findings cast strong doubt on the foremost line of evidence that landscape burning by humans caused the megafaunal extinctions, and suggest that central Australia was becoming increasingly arid in the Late Pleistocene, the relative roles of hunting by humans and climate change in the megafaunal extinctions remain unresolved.

It seems that metal contamination in the river is too high for the health of fish and the people who eat them. The geographical locations of catch, season, nature of diet, and the size of fish used for analyses might lead to different metal concentration in the same fish species.

ROLE OF MACROPHYTES IN A SEWAGE FED URBAN LAKE	IIOAB JOURNAL												Macrophytes play a major role in maintaining the nutrient levels in urban aquatic systems. However their prolific growth result in spread of invasive species such as water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) due to the availability of higher nutrient concentrations. This hinders aerobic functioning of the lake by restricting sunlight penetration and also affecting algal photosynthesis. This also results in anoxic environment due to blockage of air-water interface, influencing oxygen diffusivity. Reduction in DO (0 mg/l) impacts the viability of aquatic biota and result in the disappearance of biodiversity. This communication evaluates the influence of the invasive macrophytes in the functioning of lake across the seasons. Significant seasonal changes in water quality were noticed due to changes in the redox conditions (-235 mV) and dissolved oxygen levels at various locations depending on the extent and location of macrophyte spread based on the nutrient levels coupled with wind regime prevailing during the season. The analysis of seasonal data reveals that dissolved oxygen concentration and redox condition is dependent on the extent of macrophyte spread. N content in Lemna and Alternanthera species (of 4 g/100 g dry weight) is significant compared to other species (p<0.005). During monsoon, lake functions in the absence of macrophytes, predominantly as aerobic lagoon; and functions as aerobic-anaerobic lagoon (pre-monsoon) and as anaerobic-aerobic system (post-monsoon). Anaerobic conditions are mainly due to the interference of macrophytes in lake functioning and inefficient handling of nutrients in the absence of algae. This necessitates the regular removal of macrophytes from the lake. Provision to allow the growth of primary producers will help in nutrient management.

High-Resolution GOES Insolation-Evapotranspiration Data Set for Water Resource Management in Florida: 1995-2015	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												This paper reviews and summarizes the continued development of satellite-based estimates of insolation (incoming solar radiation), reference evapotranspiration (RET), and potential evapotranspiration (PET), computed for the State of Florida at 2-km resolution for the period from June 1, 1995, to December 31, 2015, which spans over 20years. Insolation is a primary driver of evapotranspiration in Florida. Insolation maps generated from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery were used to compute PET and RET, calibrated to ground-based pyranometers. Uncalibrated model results over the 20-year period indicate a station-averaged model error of 2.1MJm-2day-1 (12% of observed). Calibration reduced model errors to 1.6MJm-2day-1 (9% of observed) and also removed temporal, seasonal, and satellite-sensor-related biases. As a means of demonstrating the integrity of these products, overviews of the GOES-derived insolation, PET, and RET fields are presented in terms of spatial and temporal patterns over Florida. Hydrologic features that create regional weather patterns and affect PET and RET include Lake Okeechobee and the Atlantic Gulf Stream current. Selected scientific and water-management applications are summarized, as well as planned enhancements to the insolation-ET algorithm.

The objective of this study was to quantify the amount of suspended sediment concentration and sediment fixed nutrients in the wetland. Two wetlands were selected purposefully to quantify how much sediment and nutrient trapped by the wetlands and 26 runoff events were sampled for each wetland at inlet and outlet points. All runoff samples were filtered by a filter paper and measured after air dried using sensitive balance to determine sediment amount in g/L. Only 10 representative samples were subjected to nutrient analysis in the laboratory. Averagely, 7 g/L (86%) and 3 g/L (80%) suspended sediment was absorbed by wetlands in site 2 and site 1 respectively. Regarding to nutrient loss, 53, 50 and 49% nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter (OM) was absorbed by wetland in site 2 respectively. Whereas, it was 33, 29 and 31% in site 1. Thus, wetlands have crucial role to catch suspended sediment load and associated nutrients entering into downstream reservoirs and lakes.

J	Gabrielsson, S; Brogaard, S; Jerneck, A				Gabrielsson, Sara; Brogaard, Sara; Jerneck, Anne			Living without buffers-illustrating climate vulnerability in the Lake Victoria basin	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE												Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity are essential, albeit theoretically vague, components of climate vulnerability. This has triggered debate surrounding how these factors can be translated into, and understood in, an empirical context subject to present and future harm. In this article, which draws on extensive fieldwork in the Lake Victoria Basin of Kenya and Tanzania, we illustrate how exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity play out in the context of climate vulnerability and discuss how they interact in situ. Using a mixed methods approach including survey data, rainfall data and a suite of participatory methods, such as focus groups and interactive mapping of seasonal calendars, we identify how climate-induced stressors affect smallholder farmers' well-being and natural resources. Drawing on the seasonal calendar as a heuristic, and climate vulnerability terminology, we illustrate when, where and how these climate-induced stressors converge to constrain farmers' livelihoods. Our analysis indicates that farmers in the basin face a highly uncertain future with discernible, but differentiated, adaptation deficits due to recurring, and potentially worsening, patterns of hardship.						jerneck, anne/0000-0002-1429-8739													1862-4065	1862-4057				APR	2013	8	2					143	157		10.1007/s11625-012-0191-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-012-0191-3													WOS:000316878000001

Surface water samples were collected at 38 points of the water reservoir during eleven sampling campaigns between October 1998 and June 2000, covering the warm wet season and the cold dry season, and analyzed for dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, pH, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, total dissolved solids (TDS), alkalinity, hardness, bicarbonate, chloride, sulfate, calcium, magnesium, fluoride, sodium, potassium, iron, aluminum, silica, phosphate, sulfide, arsenic, chromium, lead, cadmium, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), viable aerobic bacteria (VAB) and total conform bacteria (TC). Concentrations of lead, ammonium, nitrite and conforms were higher than the maximum allowable limits for drinking water in a large proportion of the water samples. To obtain a general representation of the spatial and temporal trends of the water quality parameters at the reservoir, the three-dimensional dataset (sampling sites x parameters x sampling campaigns) has been analyzed by matrix augmentation principal component analysis (MA-PCA) and N-way principal component analysis (N-PCA) using Tucker3 and PARAFAC (Parallel Factor Analysis) models. MA-PCA produced a component accounting for the general behavior of parameters associated with organic pollution. The Tucker3 models were not appropriate for modelling the water quality dataset. The two-factor PARAFAC model provided the best picture to understand the spatial and temporal variation of the water quality parameters of the reservoir. The first PARAFAC factor contains useful information regarding the relation of organic pollution with seasonality, whereas the second factor also encloses information concerning lead pollution. The most polluted areas in the reservoir and the polluting sources were identified by plotting PARAFAC loadings as a function of the UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates.

J	Jiang, P; Ma, BJ; Ni, MF; Yuan, DN; Li, SY				Jiang, Ping; Ma, Bingjie; Ni, Maofei; Yuan, Danni; Li, Siyue			Insights into dissolved organic carbon biodegradation process and influencing factors in shallow lakes in a metropolitan, China	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												Lakes perform a pivotal role in both regional and global carbon cycles. However, seasonal variations and drivers of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) biodegradability are poorly understood in shallow urban lakes. To address this knowledge gap, a 28-day incubation experiment in urban shallow lakes was carried out to quantify proportion of biodegradable DOC (%BDOC) and temperature sensitivity (Q10 value). %BDOC and Q10 value were significantly higher in the wet season (%BDOC20: 14.48% +/- 7.92%, %BDOC30: 17.61% +/- 8.98%, Q10:1.32 +/- 0.62) over the dry season (%BDOC20: 10.35% +/- 6.98%, %BDOC30: 11.59% +/- 7.36%, Q10: 1.20 +/- 0.65). The absorbance at 350 nm (a350) followed a decreasing-increasing-decreasing trend, while a250 / a365 (E2:E3) had a contrasting trend to a350 during the incubation. Three (dry season) and five (wet season) fluorescent components were captured by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The components C2 (terrestrial humic-like) and C3 (tryptophanlike) were largely biodegraded on day 28 in the wet season. The %BDOC was positively related to total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and fluorescence index (FI), but negatively related to humification index (HIX) during the dry season. However, in the wet season, the %BDOC was positively related to TDN, TDP and DOC. The results show that the controls of DOC biodegradation shift from the combined DOC quality and nutrients (dry season) to DOC quantity (wet season). The study sheds light on the drivers of BDOC seasonality, and underscores the significance of both nutrients and DOC in understanding carbon-geochemistry within lake ecosystems.

In this lake, poor management of floating gardens cultivation by some farmers has resulted in leaching of excess nutrients, and then water and sediment were contaminated by chemical residues. This study aims to assess the environmental risk to Lake Ecosystem by investigating the nutrient contamination of water, sediment and monitoring pesticide residues from fish, sediment along with water. Sediment and Water samples have been gathered from nonGAP and GAP floating gardens, including the central lake as a reference point, during the wet season of 2019 and dry season of 2020. Health risk linked with intake of pesticide residues in fish from floating gardens and central lake are assessed. The result showed that the pesticide and fertilizer applications were increased in non-GAP when compared with GAP method. The nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) contamination was higher in non-GAP than in GAP for both water and sediment. The presence of pesticide residues in surface sediment shows that the non-GAP farms had higher concentrations than the GAP farms. For the water pollution assessment, the water quality index value was higher in non-GAP than in GAP. Nutrient pollution assessment indicated that nutrient contamination threatens in floating garden sites but non-GAP has potentially influence on Lake Ecosystem. The health risk assessment model resulted that current used pesticide residues are not caused detrimental effects on human health but in long run, low doses exposure has been linked to human health. This study concludes that poor management of agricultural practices by more agrochemicals usage has had a negative effect on the surface water, ecosystem and sediment of the lake.

Integrated management of Striga hermonthica, stemborers, and declining soil fertility in western Kenya	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Striga hermonthica (Defile) Benth., stemborers, and declining soil fertility are serious threats to sustainable food production in the Lake Victoria zone of Kenya. To address these constraints, promising integrated crop management technologies were evaluated, using a multi-locational design in four sub-locations in Siaya and Vihiga district (western Kenya) for six cropping seasons. Technologies evaluated consisted of the traditional maize (Zea mays L.) - bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) intercrop, maize - Desmodium (Desmodium uncinatum (Jacq.) DC.) push-pull intercrop, Crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don) - maize rotation, and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) - maize rotation. Within each of these systems, imazapyr-coated herbicide-resistant maize (IR-maize) and fertilizer were super-imposed as sub-plot factors. The push-pull system was observed to significantly reduce Striga emergence and stemborer damage from the second season onwards. IR-maize reduced and delayed Striga emergence from the first cropping season. Differences in Striga emergence and stemborer damage between the other systems were not significantly different. After five cropping seasons, the Striga seedbank was significantly higher in the maize-bean intercrop system than in the push-pull system under both maize varieties while the rotational systems had intermediate values not different from the day zero values. Under IR-maize, the Striga seedbank was significantly lower than under local maize for all cropping systems. Maize yields varied between seasons, districts, and cropping systems. Yields in the push-pull system were higher than in the maize-bean intercrop after two seasons and in the absence of mid-season drought stress. Both maize and soybean responded significantly to fertilizer application for both districts and for most seasons. The various interventions did not substantially affect various soil fertility-related parameters after five seasons. In the short term, IR-maize integrated in a push-pull system is the most promising option to reduce Striga while the rotational systems may need a longer timeframe to reduce the Striga seedbank. Finally, farmer-led evaluation of the various technologies will determine which of those is really most acceptable under the prevailing farming conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Brum, JR; Steward, GF				Brum, Jennifer R.; Steward, Grieg F.			Morphological Characterization of Viruses in the Stratified Water Column of Alkaline, Hypersaline Mono Lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Concentrations of viruses and prokaryotes in the alkaline, moderately hypersaline, seasonally stratified Mono Lake are among the highest reported for a natural aquatic environment. We used electron microscopy to test whether viral morphological characteristics differed among the epilimnion, metalimnion, and the anoxic hypolimnion of the lake and to determine how the properties of viruses in Mono Lake compare to other aquatic environments. Viral capsid size distributions were more similar in the metalimnion and hypolimnion of Mono Lake, while viral tail lengths were more similar in the epilimnion and metalimnion. The percentage of tailed viruses decreased with depth and the relative percentages of tailed phage families changed with depth. The presence of large (> 125 nm capsid), untailed viruses in the metalimnion and hypolimnion suggests that eukaryotic viruses are produced in these suboxic and anoxic, hypersaline environments. Capsid diameters of viruses were larger on average in Mono Lake compared to other aquatic environments, and no lemon-shaped or filamentous viruses were found, in contrast to other high-salinity or high-altitude lakes and seas. Our data suggest that the physically and chemically distinct layers of Mono Lake harbor different viral assemblages, and that these assemblages are distinct from other aquatic environments that have been studied. Furthermore, we found that filtration of a sample through a 0.22-A mu m pore-size filter significantly altered the distribution of viral capsid diameters and tail lengths, resulting in a relative depletion of viruses having larger capsids and longer tails. This observation highlights the potential for bias in molecular surveys of viral diversity, which typically rely on filtration through 0.2- or 0.22-A mu m pore-size membrane filters to remove bacteria during sample preparation.

Regular annual flooding alters the aquatic environment, thereby affecting fish feeding strategies. We studied the impact of annual flooding on fish-Hg bioaccumulation. Tucunares (Cychla spp, carnivorous), Peixe-cachorro (Hydrolycus scomberoides, carnivorous), Traira (Hoplias malabaricus, carnivorous), Piranha-branca (Serrasahnus aff. eigenamanni, carnivorous), Piranha-preta (Serrasahnus rhombeus, carnivorous), Acara (Acarichthys heckellii, omnivorous), Aracu (Leporinus frederici, omnivorous), Orana-preta (Hemiodus unimacilatus, omnivorous), Sardinha (Triportheus elongatus, omnivorous), Branquinha (Polamorhina latior, detritivorous), Jaraqui-escama-fina (Semaprochilodus taeniurus, detritivorous), and Pacu-branco (Myleus torquatus, herbivorous) were studied during high (July) and low waters (February) and categorized by body mass. Regardless of hydrological period, ranges of total-Hg concentrations were higher for carnivorous than for omnivorous, detritivorous and herbivorous species. Some species (Traira, Sardinha, Peixe-cachorro, Piranha branca, Piranha preta) showed changes in feeding patterns as indicated by an inverse trend of Hg bioaccumulation with season. Species with similar trends of Hg bioaccumulation showed higher Hg concentrations during the flooded season (Aracu, Pacu branco and Orana preta) and some had lower Fig (Acari, Branquinha and Tucunares). Fish Hg concentration is species specific and reflects changes in feeding-behavior dominance brought by annual inundation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Comparison of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Content in Filets of Anadromous and Landlocked Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus Nerka	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE												Fatty acid composition and content of 2 forms of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka from lakes in Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) were compared. One form of sockeye salmon was anadromous ("marine"), that is, adult fish migrated in ocean to feed and grow and than return in the lake to breed. Fish of another form, kokanee, never migrate in the ocean. Per cent levels of the main indicators of nutritive value, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), were significantly higher in the landlocked O. nerka. However, concentrations of EPA and DHA per wet weight of filets were higher in the marine form, because of the relatively higher content of sum of fatty acids in their muscle tissue. As concluded, fish fed in marine environment had higher contents of long-chain n-3 fatty acids per wet weight than fish of the same species, fed in fresh waters. In general, both the anadromous sockeye salmon and the landlocked kokanee salmon can be recommended for human diet as a valuable product concerning contents of EPA and DHA.

Long-term Water Quality Variations and Chlorophyll a Simulation with an Emphasis on Different Hydrological Periods in Lake Baiyangdian, Northern China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Eutrophication and water quality degradation comprise one of the most important environmental problems associated with protecting freshwater. Here, systematical analyses of trends, qualitative and quantitative analyses of water quality variables, and simulations of eutrophication were conducted to evaluate biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and Secchi disk data (SD) based on separate hydrological periods to enhance our understanding of lake ecosystem restoration. Long-term trends were identified using seasonal-trend decomposition with local error sum of squares, while non-supervised artificial neural networks were used to identify qualitative characteristics, and quantitative characteristics were measured using statistical analyses. Numerical simulation of Chl a by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm provided a theoretical solution for ecological warnings. The results were as follows: (1) declining trends in BOD, TP, TN, DO and Chl a were observed during long-term seasonal decomposition after December 2006, but SD increased after June 2003; (2) partitioned K-means maps revealed quantitative characteristics with heterogeneous changes during three hydrological periods, with BOD, TN, SD and Chl a showing the highest clustering quality; (3) BOD and DO showed clear relative hierarchies when compared with other parameters based on quantitative analysis; (4) Chl a simulation revealed heterogeneous changes in the three hydrological periods, and sensitivity analyses indicated that BOD was highly sensitive to Chl a, but TP was not. The sensitivities of other parameters changed during different hydrological periods. The methods described here can be used as preliminary management tools for degraded lakes.					wang, xuan/JBJ-6948-2023														1726-2135	1684-8799				DEC	2012	20	2					90	102		10.3808/jei.201200223	http://dx.doi.org/10.3808/jei.201200223													WOS:000313852500004

Climatic, socio-economic, and health factors affecting human vulnerability to cholera in the Lake Victoria basin, East Africa	AMBIO												Cholera epidemics have a recorded history in the eastern Africa region dating to 1836. Cholera is now endemic in the Lake Victoria basin, a region with one of the poorest and fastest growing populations in the world. Analyses of precipitation, temperatures, and hydrological characteristics of selected stations in the Lake Victoria basin show that cholera epidemics are closely associated with El Nino years. Similarly, sustained temperatures high above normal (Tmax) in two consecutive seasons, followed by a slight cooling in the second season, trigger an outbreak of a cholera epidemic. The health and socioeconomic systems that the lake basin communities rely upon are not robust enough to cope with cholera outbreaks, thus rendering them vulnerable to the impact of climate variability and change. Collectively, this report argues that communities living around the Lake Victoria basin are vulnerable to climate-induced cholera that is aggravated by the low socioeconomic status and lack of an adequate health care system. In assessing the communities' adaptive capacity, the report concludes that persistent levels of poverty have made these communities vulnerable to cholera epidemics.					; Marshall, Michael/F-1208-2017	Downs, Timothy/0000-0002-7569-3812; Marshall, Michael/0000-0002-9738-5036; OLAKA, LYDIA/0000-0002-5917-7586; Yanda, Pius/0000-0002-0574-6309													0044-7447					JUN	2007	36	4					350	358		10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[350:CSAHFA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[350:CSAHFA]2.0.CO;2								17626474					WOS:000247451500011

Two published data sets of helminths of the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (L.) were analysed to test the hypothesis that the structure of these component communities is influenced by interactions between species. A range of tests, with differing null models, was applied to tease out the importance of controlling for subgroupings (e.g. sex, age, site, year, season) within the data when searching for significant associations based on prevalence (co-occurrence, presence/absence) or abundance (quantitative associations) data. 2. Significant differences from null models were detected for associations based on prevalence, but when subgroup constraints were taken into consideration, most lost significance. Among three and 15 pair-wise associations possible in data sets 1 and 2, respectively, only that between Trichuris muris and Heligmosomoides polygyrus was not dependent on context, and that between H. polygyrus and Catenotaenia pusilla, while always positive, varied in magnitude among sites of capture. 3. Pair-wise comparisons of abundance revealed three significant associations, only one of which (H. polygyrus with C. pusilla) still remained significant after controlling for quantified extrinsic and intrinsic factors. With increasing burdens of H. polygyrus, mice carried more of other helminth species and this relationship remained significant after controlling for confounding factors. 4. Overall, positive co-occurrences of pairs of helminths of A. sylvaticus were highly context dependent and quantitative associations were weak and not convincing. Therefore, interactions between parasites are unlikely to play a dominant role among the processes that structure the component community of helminths in wood mice, in selected study sites in the south of England.

For effective groundwater management, recharge areas need identification and replenishment quantification. At present, little research exploring unsaturated zone water flow processes and groundwater recharge are available. In this study, 12 vertical soil profiles were analysed for stable water isotopes and chloride concentration to estimate evaporation and groundwater renewal. Most delta O-18 and delta H-2 isotope profiles reveal typical arid environment patterns, with maximum enrichment at depths between 2.5 and 20 cm and depletion towards the surface (atmospheric influence) and depth (mixing and diffusion). Average annual dry season evaporation rates in Salamat and Waza Logone range from 5 to 30 mm, in Bahr el Ghazal and Northern Lake Chad from 14 to 23 mm. According to the chloride mass balance (CMB), the average annual recharge rate is estimated between 3 and 163 mm in Salamat and Waza Logone and less than 1 mm in Bahr el Ghazal and Northern Lake Chad.

All BDE congeners show increasing trends up to the mid-1980s (Sigma5PBDE from 60 to 1600 pg/g wet weight in 1989, i.e. a more than 25-fold increase), and then decrease or level off. The decreasing trends of PBDEs after the 1980s were considerably slower in the present study than was found in a study of an environmental matrix from the Baltic Proper covering the same time period. This difference suggests local sources near Lake Bolmen. The MeO-BDEs show initially decreasing concentrations, which for 6-MeO-BDE47 continues until the early 1990s. The concentrations of 6-MeO-BDE47 in herring from five locations along the Swedish coast increased from south to north in the Baltic Sea. No correlation between the concentrations of the BDE congeners and the MeO-BDEs was observed, indicating sources other than PBDEs for these compounds. The presence of MeO-BDEs in fish from lakes with different characteristics suggests a natural production not favoured by eutrophication, or dependent on sampling season and geographical location.

JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH												McMahon, JJ, Lake, JP, Dos'Santos, T, Jones, PA, Thomasson, ML, and Comfort, P. Countermovement jump standards in rugby league: what is a "good" performance? J Strength Cond Res 36(6): 1691-1698, 2022-The countermovement jump (CMJ) is considered an important test in rugby league, and the force platform is the recommended tool for assessing CMJ performance in this cohort. Because of inconsistent methods applied across previous studies, there is currently a lack of understanding of what constitutes a "good" CMJ performance, with respect to the typical CMJ metrics that are reported for rugby league players. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to produce a scale of reference values for the jump height (JH), reactive strength index modified (RSImod), and mean (PPmean) and peak (PPpeak) propulsion power (relative to body mass) for top-level senior rugby league players competing in the global "forward" and "back" positional groups. One hundred four players (55 forwards and 49 backs) from the top 2 tiers of English rugby league performed 3 CMJs on a force platform at the beginning of pre-season training. The JH, RSImod, PPmean, and PPpeak were calculated using criterion methods, and a scale of norm-referenced values (percentiles) was produced for each positional group. The backs outperformed the forwards for each CMJ metric reported, thus supporting the production of position-specific norm-referenced values. When each positional group was separated into quartile subgroups, the respective JH, RSImod, PPmean, and PPpeak values were mostly largely and significantly different both within and between positions. The presented scale of reference values can, therefore, be used to determine the performance standards of rugby league forwards and backs with respect to the most commonly reported CMJ-derived variables for this cohort.

J	Regan, KH; Nault, BA				Regan, Karly H.; Nault, Brian A.			Impact of Reducing Synthetic Chemical Inputs on Pest and Disease Management in Commercial Onion Production Systems	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Onion production is reliant on synthetic chemical inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides to ensure its profitability. In the Great Lakes region (USA), onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) and a complex of bacterial pathogens that cause bulb rot disease threaten the sustainability of onion production. The potential exists for reducing T. tabaci infestations and bulb rot disease incidence in onions by decreasing the amounts of fertilizer applied at planting and the insecticide applied to foliage during the season. In a three-year study that included 20 New York commercial onion fields, the impact of synthetic fertilizer (no fertilizer, half rate, and full rate) and insecticide use (action threshold-based application program and weekly application program) on T. tabaci populations and bulb rot disease incidence was examined. Results indicated that the amount of fertilizer applied to an onion at planting had no impact on T. tabaci population levels, bulb rot disease incidence, or onion bulb size and yield. In contrast, insecticide use had the greatest impact on reducing T. tabaci densities. Both the action threshold-based program and weekly spray program reduced T. tabaci infestation levels below the economic injury level, but the action threshold program averaged 2.3 fewer applications per season. The insecticide program had no effect on bulb rot incidence, bulb size, or yield. We conclude that synthetic fertilizer and insecticide inputs can be reduced substantially without compromising onion bulb yields, and this should lead to greater profits and a reduction of chemicals in the environment.

Seasonal changes in the rotifer (Rotifera) diversity from a tropical high altitude reservoir (Valle de Bravo, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												We studied the zooplankton community composition at different depths (2, 4, 8,12 and 20 m) of Valle de Bravo, a drinking water reservoir in central Mexico during December 2005 to November 2006. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and chlorophyll a were measured simultaneously. While physicochemical values were similar to those found in previous studies, total zooplankton abundance was higher (mean 84 7 ind. l(-1)), doubling the mean abundance found in the previous year Nevertheless, Zooplankton remained dominated by the rotifer genera Keratella, Polyarthra and Trichocerca, which constituted nearly 80% of the total numerical abundances. We encountered 23 rotifer species of which 5 of them (Lepadella rhomboides, Cephalodelle catellina, Trichocerca elongate, T porcellus and Dicranophorus forcipatus) were recorded for the first time from this reservoir. Shannon Wiener diversity index showed that the annual mean species diversity index was similar at depths of 2, 4 and 8 m, but were reduced at 12 and 20 m. Regardless of depth, the highest diversity value of 1.82 was observed during January, while the lowest (0.07) during March, Principal component analysis showed that temperature, dissolved oxygen, water column depth and chlorophyll a have combined effects on the abundance of dominant rotifer species. The highest rotifer density was observed in April(>1600 individuals l(-1)), while the lowest was recorded during January (<50 ind. l(-1)). During the study period, the most abundant rotifer species were Keratelle chochlearis, Polyarthra vulgaris, Trichocecre elongate and Anuraeopsis fissa.

Geochemical characteristics of water and sediment from the Dal Lake, Kashmir Himalaya: constraints on weathering and anthropogenic activity	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Two hundred and forty water samples (in four seasons) and seventeen sediment samples have been analyzed to monitor the natural and anthropogenic influences on the water and sediment chemistry of the Dal Lake, Kashmir Himalaya. The scatter diagrams [(Ca + Mg)/total cations (TZ(+)), (Ca + Mg)/HCO3, (Ca + Mg)/(HCO3 + SO4), (Na + K)/TZ(+); (Ca + Mg)/(Na + K)] and the geological map of the study area suggest predominance of carbonate and silicate weathering. Lower pH and high total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity and NO3- values in the Gagribal basin and in some patches of other basins reflect anthropogenic inputs in the form of sewage from surrounding population, houseboats, hotels, etc. The Dal Lake is characterized by high chemical index of alteration (CIA: 87-95), reflecting extreme weathering of the catchment area. Relative to the average carbonates, the lakebed sediments are enriched in Al, Ti, Zn, Cu and Co and depleted in Ni and Mn. Compared to the post-Archean Shale the sediments have higher Al, Zn and Cu contents and lower Ni and Co. There are distinct positive anomalies of Al, Mn, Zn and Cu and negative anomalies of Ni and Pb with respect to the upper continental crust. Geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and the US Environmental Protection Agency sediment quality standards indicate that the Gagribal basin and some patches of the Nagin basin are polluted with respect to Zn, Cu and Pb. These data suggest that the Dal Lake is characterized by differential natural and anthropogenic influences.

It combines a buoyancy-extended k-epsilon model with a seiche excitation and damping model to predict the diffusivity below the surface mixed layer. The model was applied to predict the seasonal development of temperature stratification and turbulent diffusivity in two medium-sized lakes over time periods ranging from 3 weeks to 2 years. Depending on the type of boundary condition for temperature, two or three model parameters were optimized to calibrate the model. The agreement between the simulated and the observed temperature distributions is excellent, in particular, if lake surface temperatures were prescribed as surface boundary condition instead of temperature gradients derived from heat fluxes. Comparison of different model variants revealed that inclusion of horizontal pressure gradients and/or stability functions is not required to provide good agreement between model results and data. With the aid of uncertainty analysis it is shown that the depth of the mixed surface layer during the stratified period could be predicted accurately within +/-1 m. The sensitivity of the model to several parameters is discussed.

Trends in phosphorus fluxes are driven by intensification of biosolids applications in the Upper St. Johns River Basin (Florida, United States). Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Biosolids are beneficially used in agricultural production, but the potential for nutrient enrichment, primarily phosphorus (P), in runoff water remains a concern. This study provides strong correlative evidence that intensified Class B biosolids applications led to increases in total P (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) fluxes in the Upper St. Johns River Basin (USJRB). In 2013, new state regulations resulted in the elimination of Class B biosolids applications in 3 watersheds encompassing most of southern Florida. Most of the applications from these watersheds were shifted into the USJRB, which received 78% of statewide Class B biosolids applications by 2019. Weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season (WRTDS) were used to evaluate the relationship between long-term (1995-2020) trends in tributary TP and TN concentrations and fluxes and the timing and magnitude of biosolids applications in 8 USJRB watersheds. No significant land use change occurred that could account for water quality trends. Flow-normalized concentrations and fluxes were generally stable from 1995 to 2012, but after intensification of applications in 2013, significant increases occurred in 6 and 4 watersheds for TP and TN, respectively. P fluxes increased by 0.9-16.4 metric tons (MT; 40-200%) and N fluxes increased by 1.6-19.7 MT (5-20%). The magnitude of P and N flux increases were between 0.5% and 2.0% of land-applied biosolids P and N, which suggests that small losses of P and N from the landscape were required to produce the observed trends.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				SEP 6	2022	38	3					215	227		10.1080/10402381.2022.2082345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2022.2082345		MAY 2022											WOS:000815421600001
J	Peterson, D; Pearson, J; Simpson, W				Peterson, Douglas; Pearson, James; Simpson, William			Effects of common carp on water quality and submerged vegetation: results from a short-term mesocosm experiment in an artificial we and	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Bioturbation by non-native common carp (carp) can facilitate an ecosystem phase shift from clear to turbid water in shallow lakes and ponds, with negative effects on abundance of aquatic animals and plants. Management of carp often involves reducing populations below a threshold biomass at which important components of the aquatic ecosystem, like submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), recover. To evaluate control targets for a nuisance carp population in Malheur Lake in SE Oregon, USA, we conducted a mesocosm experiment in a small wetland within the lake's drainage basin. We stocked 200-m(2) enclosures with individual or multiple carp of different age classes at target biomasses of 50, 100, and 300 kg ha(-1). We measured turbidity, total suspended sediments, nutrients, chlorophyll-alpha, and surface coverage of SAV four times within a single growing season. Turbidity increased through time and soluble P was higher in 300 kg ha(-1) carp treatments compared to the control, but few changes were observed for any of the other variables at any biomass. Results suggest that with well established SAV, a maintenance carp biomass threshold of <200 kg ha(-1) will not result in a phase shift from a clear- to turbid-water state in the short-term.					; Pearson, James/AAC-9390-2020	Simpson, William/0000-0002-2449-0476; Peterson, Douglas/0000-0002-0196-0076; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2022	73	7					973	994		10.1071/MF22008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF22008		MAY 2022											WOS:000802222500001
J	Naddafi, R; Pettersson, K; Eklöv, P				Naddafi, Rahmat; Pettersson, Kurt; Eklov, Peter			Effects of the zebra mussel, an exotic freshwater species, on seston stoichiometry	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined the effect of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, an exotic species, on seston stoichiometry by conducting laboratory experiments in which we varied nutrient composition of seston and mussels over time. Zebra mussels altered the stoichiometry of seston through removal of particulate organic nutrients and changed the stoichiometry of the dissolved nutrient pool through nutrient excretion. Grazers had stronger effects on carbon : phosphorus (C : P) and nitrogen (N) : P ratios than on the C: N ratio of seston. Elemental residence time in tissue and high mass-specific nutrient excretion by small mussels caused small mussels to be more efficient nutrient recyclers than larger mussels. Zebra mussels reduced P availability through enhancing C: P and N: P molar ratios of seston during the period extending from June to August, when P was limited in the lake, and increased the C: N molar ratio of seston in June, when N was at the minimum level in the lake. C: P and N: P molar ratios for zebra mussel tissue were higher in August and somewhat in September than in all other months. N was retained more efficiently than P in Dreissena tissue. Nutrient mass-specific uptake rate was higher than excretion rate by zebra mussels.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2008	53	5					1973	1987		10.4319/lo.2008.53.5.1973	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.5.1973													WOS:000259356000024

J	Xu, YH; Peng, H; Yang, YQ; Zhang, WS; Wang, SL				Xu, Yanhong; Peng, Hong; Yang, Yinqun; Zhang, Wanshun; Wang, Shuangling			A cumulative eutrophication risk evaluation method based on a bioaccumulation model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Water pollution problems related to rapid economic development have received considerable attention in recent years, and water eutrophication has become one of the greatest threats to aquatic environments around the world. In this study, we introduce a eutrophication risk assessment method to address the urgent need for simple but effective modeling tools to support environmental management. This method is based on a bioaccumulation model and algal growth dynamics. The water eutrophication risk is expressed by the ratio of the algal concentration in a water body and the critical algal concentration for eutrophication. The combined and cumulative effects of meteorological factors (e.g., temperature and light intensity), water quality factors (e.g., TN, TP, and NH3-N), and biological factors (e.g., algal settlement and normal death) on eutrophication are considered. We examine the advantages of our eutrophication risk assessment model using the seasonal, mesotrophic Xikeng Reservoir (Shenzhen City, China) as a case study and analyze three typical sets of meteorological and water quality conditions. Prior parameter distributions were chosen based on both a literature survey and experimental research. The results indicate that the combined actions of multiple external factors have a long impact on the eutrophication risk of the Xikeng Reservoir. Eutrophication was observed on the 6th day of the simulation time in the Xikeng Reservoir under the influence of higher temperature (T= 28.3 degrees C), higher light intensity (I = 6037 lx), and higher pollutants concentration (C-TN = 5.40 mg/L, C-TP = 0.391 mg/L, CNH3-N = 4.18 mg/L). These findings indicate that Xikeng Reservoir influence by similar environmental conditions should receive more of our attention to prevent eutrophication. Finally, we highlight the benefits of the new eutrophication risk assessment model, including its simple calculation process, reduced parameter set, and accurate prediction of eutrophication tendency. These features make the model perfectly suited for stakeholders and policy makers who need to make risk management assessment of environmental water, especially for the environmental management of areas where data are unavailable.

Through observation of CO2 concentration at different heights, this study examined whether a CO2 lake phenomenon exists in the Larix gmelinii ecosystem of the Greater Khingan Mountains (China), and how it might be changed and what might represent its driving factors if such a phenomenon were found to exist. Plants and soils were sampled regularly to determine delta 13C and to quantify the proportion of C released by each component of the ecosystem. The main path of C release and the main source of CO2 lake formation were investigated. Statistical analysis revealed that a CO2 lake phenomenon does exist in the L. gmelinii ecosystem. Comparative analysis showed that on the daily scale, when the ecosystem was a C source, the CO2 lake phenomenon often occurred. On the scale of the growing season, the strongest CO2 lake was accompanied by emergence of the peak respiratory flux. Stepwise regression analysis showed that environmental factors could explain 74.87% of the CO2 lake phenomenon. The occurrence and strength of the CO2 lakes were found to mainly respond to changes in temperature. Linear model analysis revealed that the rate of C release from autotrophic respiration in the forest was 51.18%; the rate of C release from heterotrophic respiration during litter decomposition was 51.78%. Therefore, the C release of the L. gmelinii ecosystem is mainly from autotrophic respiration.

Thirty small upland lakes in Cumbria, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were visited three times between April and August 2000. On each occasion water chemistry was measured and phytoplankton bioassays were performed in the laboratory to assess growth-rate and yield limitation by phosphorus and nitrogen. In addition, yield limitation of periphyton growth was investigated twice, in situ, using nutrient-diffusing substrata. 2. Over the whole season the percentage frequency of P, N and co-limitation was 24, 13 and 63%, respectively, for phytoplankton rate limitation and 20, 22 and 58%, respectively, for phytoplankton yield limitation. 3. A clear response of periphyton yield to nutrient additions was found in 75% of all cases and of these, co-limitation was most common (54%). Average percentage frequency for P and N limitation was 26 and 20%, respectively. 4. Phytoplankton and periphyton showed seasonal changes in nutrient limitation within sites. In particular, co-limitation became progressively more common as the season progressed. 5. The response of phytoplankton growth rate to ammonium and nitrate addition was identical, but ammonium was a slightly better source of nitrogen than nitrate for phytoplankton yield on 7% and for periphyton yield on 10% of the occasions. However, the magnitude of the effect was small. 6. The concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and the molar ratio of DIN to total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), appeared to be the main environmental factors controlling the extent of nitrogen or phosphorus limitation at a given site. Nitrogen limitation was more likely than phosphorus limitation where the DIN was <6.5 mmol m(-3) and the ratio of DIN : TDP was <53. Co-limitation was the most likely outcome at a DIN concentration <13 mmol m(-3) and at a DIN : TDP molar ratio <250. Above these values phosphorus limitation was most likely. 7. The relatively high frequency of nitrogen limitation and co-limitation at higher N : P ratios than previously reported, may result from the inability of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria to thrive in these upland lakes where pH and the concentration of phosphorus tended to be low and where flushing rates tended to be high.

Relationships between microcystins and environmental parameters in 30 subtropical shallow lakes along the Yangtze River, China	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A survey of 30 subtropical shallow lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River area in China was conducted during July-September in 2003-2004 to study how environmental and biological variables were associated with the concentration of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin (MC). 2. Mean MC concentration in seasonally river-connected lakes (SL) was nearly 33 times that in permanently river-connected lakes (RL), and more than six times that in city lakes (NC) and non-urban lakes (NE) which were not connected to the Yangtze River. The highest MC (8.574 mu g L-1) was detected in Dianshan Lake. 3. MC-RR and MC-LR were the primary toxin variants in our data. MC-RR, MC-YR and MC-LR were significantly correlated with Ch1 a, biomass of cyanobacteria, Microcystis and Anabaena, indicating that microcystins were mainly produced by Microcystis and Anabaena sp. in these lakes. 4. Nonlinear interval maxima regression indicated that the relationships of Secchi depth, total nitrogen (TN) : total phosphorus UP) and NH4+ with MC were characterised by negative exponential curves. The relationships between MC and TN, TP, NO3- + NO2- were fitted well with a unimodal curve. 5. Multivariate analyses by principal component and classifying analysis indicated that MC was mainly affected by Microcystis among the biological factors, and was closely related with temperature among physicochernical factors.

The results obtained from three field campaigns at the two sites indicate the importance of convection in the lake in driving gas flux across the water-air interface. Measurements were performed during short (1-3 day) periods with observed diurnal changes between stratified and convective conditions in the lakes. Over Toolik Lake the EC net CO2 efflux was 114 +/- 33 mg C m(-2) d(-1), which compares well with the 131 +/- 2 mg C m(-2) d(-1) estimated by a boundary layer model (BLM) and the 153 +/- 3 mg C m(-2) d(-1) obtained with a surface renewal model (SRM). Floating chamber measurements, however, indicated a net efflux of 365 +/- 61 mg C m(-2) d(-1), which is more than double the EC fluxes measured at the corresponding times (150 +/- 78 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). The differences between continous (EC, SRM, and BLM) and episodic (chamber) flux determination indicate that the chamber measurements might be biased depending on the chosen sampling interval. Significantly smaller fluxes (p < 0.06) were found during stratified periods (51 +/- 42 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) than were found during convective periods (150 +/- 45 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) by the EC method, but not by the BLM. However, the congruence between average values obtained by the models and EC supports the use of both methods, but EC measurements and the SRM provide more insight into the physical-biological processes affecting gas flux. Over Soppensee, the daily net efflux from the lake was 289 +/- 153 mg C m(-2) d(-1) during the measuring period. Flux differences were significant (p < 0.002) between stratified periods (240 +/- 82 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and periods with penetrative convection (1117 +/- 236 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) but insignificant if convection in the lake was weak and nonpenetrative. Our data indicate the importance of periods of heat loss and convective mixing to the process of gas exchange across the water surface, and calculations of gas transfer velocity using the surface renewal model support our observations. Future studies should employ the EC method in order to obtain essential data for process-scale investigations. Measurements should be extended to cover the full season from thaw to freeze, thereby integrating data over stratified and convective periods. Thus the statistical confidence in the seasonal budgets of CO2 and other trace gases that are exchanged across lake surfaces could be increased considerably.

J	Coutouly, YAG				Gomez Coutouly, Yan Axel			Rise and Fall of the Yubetsu Method: pressure-flaked microblade debitage in the North Pacific during the Peopling of the New World (from the End of the Pleistocene to the Early Holocene)	BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE PREHISTORIQUE FRANCAISE												This research is based on a doctoral thesis on the diffusion of microblade technology in the North Pacific, from the Far East to its dispersal to Canada through Siberia and Alaska. This is a pioneering work where, for the first time, distant and difficult-to-access collections from both sides of the Bering Strait have been systematically studied using the same analytical protocol. The progression of pressure-flaked microblade knapping has been tracked, from its origin in the Far East about 25,000 years ago until its diffusion to Canada. Pressure-flaked microblades are a privileged marker allowing migrations and interactions of prehistoric human groups to be witnessed, and are here used to follow the progression of these industries to North America within the context of the initial colonization of the New World. Indeed, few tool types or techniques allow such traceability. It is precisely for this reason that, as early as the 1930s, N. C. Nelson suggested for the first time a possible cultural connection between Asia and America, based on the similarities between microblade cores from Shabarakh Usu in Mongolia and the Campus site in Alaska. Since then, numerous studies have been carried out on microblade industries in north-east Asia and north-western America, including the pioneering work of M.-L. Inizan, who recognized the culturally relevant character of tracking the progression of the pressure technique for producing microblades. In this article, we analyse region by region the microblade components, distribution and the knapping methods used for the production of pressure-flaked microblades (Yubetsu method, Horoka method, Campus method, etc.), discussing in particular the diffusion (or non-diffusion) of certain methods. The analysis was made through the direct study of 24 collections dated between c. 22000 and 9000 cal. BP from the Russian Far East (Primorye), Siberia (Yakutia, Kolyma, Tchoukotka and Kamchatka) and north-western North America (Alaska and British Columbia), as well as some younger materials for comparison. This work includes the area of Beringia and some of its neighbouring territories, such as the Asian Far East (Primorye) and the north-west coast of North America (British Columbia), because they are essential to the understanding of pressure-flaked industries. Indeed, the Far East is probably the cradle of the pressure-flaking knapping technique of microblades, and British Columbia signs the southern limit of the diffusion of this technology on the American continent. In the Russian Far East, the study took into account prehistoric sites from southern Primorye, including three main sites: Ustinovka-6 (Zerkalnaya Valley), Molodezhnaya-1 (Ilistaya Valley) and Risovoye-1 (Arsenievska Valley). Other smaller assemblages were also examined for comparison: Gorbatka-2, 3 and 5, Novovarvarovka-1 and Ivanovka-2 and 3. The region of Siberia was studied through ten assemblages from four large regions: Yakutia (Dyuktai Cave, Verkhne-Troitskaya, Ezhantsy and Berelekh), Kolyma (Druchak-Vetrenny, Kheta and Lenchik), Kamchatka (Ushki Lake-1 and Ushki Lake-5) and Chukotka (Tytylvaam-4 and Ayon). Concerning North America, the studied assemblages come from interior Alaska (Swan Point, Dry Creek II and Panguingue Creek), north-central Alaska (Amakomanak), the Aleutian Islands (Anangula), the south-east coast of Alaska (Thorne River) and British Columbia (Richardson Island, Arrow Creek-1 and Namu). From the Far East, we have studied directly only the Russian region of the Primorye where the Ustinovka complex represents the regional facies of industries with a microblade component. The chrono-cultural framework of the region remains very uncertain today, given the lack of absolute dating. Unlike what we have documented in Siberia (where the Yubetsu method prevails) and Alaska (where the Campus method prevails), the Primorye (and other parts of the Far East) is characterized by a multiplicity of knapping methods, sometimes even within a single assemblage. These include the Yubetsu method (on a bifacial preform), the Horoka method (on flake blanks), the Unewara method (on pebble blanks), the Togeshita method (on blade blanks), the Campus method (on flake blanks), as well as microblade cores on a range of diverse blanks. The study of the Russian Far East brings a different perspective because, unlike Siberia and North America, a whole laminar production is associated with these assemblages. In Siberia, the discovery of the Dyuktai Cave by Y. A. Mochanov in 1967 gave rise to the first definition of the Dyuktai complex, the Siberian facies of microblade-bearing industries. In Siberia, the productions associated with microblade industries include bifacial pieces, burins, endscrapers, large retouched flakes and sometimes large retouched blades. The earliest sites of this complex appear reliably starting at c. 16000-15 000 cal. BP. In these Siberian regions (Yakutia, Kolyma, Chukotka, Kamchatka), microblade cores are mainly produced according to the Yubetsu method, both on studied sites (Dyuktai Cave, Verkhne-Troitskaya, Ushki Lake-1, Ushki Lake-5, Druchak-Vetrenny, Tytylvaam, etc.) and in published assemblages. However, several variants of the Yubetsu method have been documented, with different core sizes, different technical procedures to prepare the striking platform and various pressure-flaking knapping techniques. The earliest human occupation known to date in Alaska is the CZ4b level of Swan Point, starting c. 14500 cal. BP. This assemblage is mainly made up of Yubetsu-type microblade cores and burins, making it the only prehistoric site in Alaska with a systematic production of Yubetsu cores. Indeed, the more recent sites of the Denali complex, from c. 12500 cal. BP, are characterized by the use of the Campus method, as well as conical or tabular shape microblade cores later on during the Holocene period. The first microblade sites on the north-west Pacific coast of America (starting around 10500 cal. BP) are located in south-eastern Alaska and British Columbia, and are generally considered to be an extension of the Denali complex (although the lithic productions associated with the microblade industries are very different from those from interior Alaska). Microblade sites from the coast are characterized by the presence of some wedge-shaped cores (sometimes using the Campus method), but also of conical and tabular microblade cores.																			0249-7638	1760-7361				JAN-MAR	2018	115	1					7	42																WOS:000461702800002

Is the impact of eutrophication on phytoplankton diversity dependent on lake volume/ecosystem size?	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Research focusing on biodiversity responses to the interactions of ecosystem size and anthropogenic stressors are based mainly on correlative gradient studies, and may therefore confound size-stress relationships due to spatial context and differences in local habitat features across ecosystems. We investigated how local factors related to anthropogenic stressors (e.g., eutrophication) interact with ecosystem size to influence species diversity. In this study, constructed lake mesocosms (with two contrasting volumes: 1020 (shallow mesocosms) and 2150 (deep mesocosms) litres) were used to simulate ecosystems of different size and manipulated nutrient levels to simulate mesotrophic and hypertrophic conditions. Using a factorial design, we assessed how the interaction between ecosystem size and nutrients influences phytoplankton diversity. We assessed community metrics (richness, diversity, evenness and total biovolumes) and multivariate community structure over a growing season (May to early November 2011). Different community structures were found between deep and shallow mescosoms with nutrient enrichment: Cyanobacteria dominated in the deep and Charophyta in the shallow mesocosms. In contrast, phytoplankton communities were more similar to each other in the low nutrient treatments; only Chlorophyta had generally a higher biovolume in the shallow compared to the deep mesocosms. These results suggest that ecosystem size is not only a determinant of species diversity, but that it can mediate the influence of anthropogenic effects on biodiversity. Such interactions increase the uncertainty of global change outcomes, and should therefore not be ignored in risk/impact assessment and management.

J	Basumatary, SK; Gogoi, B; Prasad, V				Basumatary, Sadhan K.; Gogoi, Bikash; Prasad, Vandana			Characteristic modern pollen assemblages in relation to vegetation types in the East Khasi Hills, northeast India	PALYNOLOGY												This paper presents characteristic modern pollen assemblages in relation to various vegetation types from one of the wettest regions of the world. Four characteristic modern pollen assemblages were recorded based on the major pollen taxa recovered from the surface samples. The Pinus-Tsuga-Betula-Quercus-Rhododendron-Chenopodiaceae assemblage was observed in pine forests under cold and wet climate in the region. The broad leaved forests were characterised by the Quercus-Betula-Alnus-Rhododendron-Pinus-Impatiens assemblage. The evergreen forest assemblage Castanopsis-Mesua-Betula-Magnoliaceae-Dipterocarpaceae-Nepenthes was suggestive of a cold and wet climate due to seasonally high rainfall activity. Grassland was identified by the recovery of a Poaceae-Cyperaceae-Asteraceae-Chenopodiaceae-cerealia assemblage in the surface samples under relatively dry climate with seasonal rainfall. The study revealed that the grasslands of East Khasi Hills are not the primary vegetation, but that it is converted from the primary dense forest as evidenced by the recovery of pollen from evergreen and broadleaved taxa in the surface samples. The presence of cerealia in almost all samples strongly indicates human activity in and around the study areas. Ferns, especially Cyathea, Gleichenia and Pyrrosia, in the palynoassemblage were suggestive of wet conditions in the region. Fungal remains such as Meliola, Microthyriaceae and Xylaria along with high organic matter in the palynoassemblage also suggest the same. The thrust of this study was to investigate the characteristic pollen assemblage in the surface samples in relation to the present vegetation of northeast India.

The objective was to evaluate the variability of total suspended solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a as well as the rainfall/ temperature and land use impacts on these optically active constituents (OAC). The study area is the Passo Real reservoir in south Brazil. The methodology was divided in four steps. First, we used wavelet to detect anomalous periods of rainfall and temperature (2002-2014). Second, we carried out 12 field campaigns to obtain in situ measurements for limnological characterization (2009-2010). The third step was the analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra and Aqua satellites data corrected and non-corrected for bidirectional effects. Finally, we evaluated potential drivers of OAC changes over time using cross-correlation analysis. The results showed a decrease in the TSS and chlorophyll-a concentrations from the upper to the lower streams of the reservoir. The exponential regression between the MODIS red reflectance and TSS had an adjusted r(2) of 0.63. It decreased to 0.53 for the relationship between the green reflectance and chlorophyll-a. MODIS data corrected for bidirectional effects provided better OAC estimates than non-corrected data. The validation of MODIS TSS and chlorophyll-a estimates using a separate set of measurements showed a RMSE of 2.98 mg/I and 2.33 mu g/l, respectively. MODIS estimates indicated a gradual transition in OAC from the upper to the lower streams in agreement with the patterns observed using field limnological data. The analysis of land use (greenness) showed two well-defined crop cycles per year. The highest seasonal concentrations of TSS and chlorophyll-a were observed in December and the lowest concentrations in April. Despite the interrelationships between both factors, our cross-correlation analysis indicated that the great concentrations of TSS and chlorophyll-a were primarily controlled by rainfall and secondarily by land use.

J	Xu, C				Xu, Chang			Evaluating mass loading products by comparison to GPS array daily solutions	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												We evaluate the benefit of different global geophysical loading products on the internal scatter of GPS position time-series from 240 globally distributed sites. We focus on the non-tidal atmospheric pressure loading predicted from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-NATML) and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational model (ECMWF-NATML), non-tidal ocean loading predicted from the Ocean Model for Circulation and Tides model (OMCT-NTOL), and the continental water storage loading predicted from the MERRA model (MERRA-CWSL) and the GFZ's Land Surface Discharge Model (LSDM-CWSL), respectively. The result shows that the root mean square (RMS) discrepancy of different CWSL models is larger than that of NATML models in the vertical component due to the varying model parameters and input data choices. We discuss the performance of different loading models and their combination to reduce the weighted RMS of GPS up-coordinates. MERRA-NATML&OMCT-NTOL&MERRA-CWSL reduced the weighted RMS (WRMS) in 96 per cent (JPL solutions) and 86 per cent (SOPAC solutions) of the cases, and ECMWF-NATML & OMCT-NTOL & LSDM-CWSL reduced the WRMS in 95 per cent (JPL solutions) and 88 per cent (SOPAC solutions) of the cases. The result shows that local effects and technical uncertainties in GPS time-series hamper the meaningful comparison between GPS observations and mass loading models. Hence, simply using the RMS of the time-series as the assessment criteria may lead to biased comparison results. Nonetheless, we give a detailed comparison (differences in phase and amplitude at seasonal timescales) for eight representative stations located adjacent to great rivers, lakes and reservoirs. We find that LSDM can provide a complementary model to study the small-scale hydrological loading like loading extremes along river channels. However, such small-scale hydrological loading effects are still instable to be modelled in some regions with its current accuracy. Finally, we discuss the impacts of mass loading corrections on the velocity and noise estimates. The noise reductions have the consistent performance as WRMS reductions for most sites, whereas some sites have their noise increased even though GPS signal WRMS is decreased there, suggesting that our posterior correction is potentially feasible, but not sufficient.

Palmitic acid and oleic acid were the predominant saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in all the species analyzed. The highest value of total SFA was detected in Liza abu (48.94%).

Cyprinion macrostomus had the highest percentage (72.65%) of total PUFA. The ratio of omega 3/omega 6 PUFAs ranged from 0.39 to 3.53. Chondrostoma regium, Barbus rajonorum, Carasobarbus luteus, Leuciscus lepidus, Acanthobrama marmid, C. macrostomus, and Silurus triostegus may be preferable for a healthy diet as a result of their high C20:5 omega 3 and C22:6 omega 3 content.

Middle Holocene Fishing Strategies in East Africa: Zooarchaeological Analysis of Pundo, a Kansyore Shell Midden in Northern Nyanza (Kenya)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OSTEOARCHAEOLOGY												A zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis is presented for the faunal remains from the Pundo shell midden in northern Nyanza province (Kenya), which contains Kansyore ceramics and dates to ca. 8000-7600 cal. BP. The faunal assemblage is overwhelmingly dominated by fish and molluscs, of which only the fish data are presented in detail. Taxonomic identifications suggest a diachronic change in relative species abundance, with cichlids becoming increasingly dominant, eventually comprising nearly 80% of the fish assemblage. The Pundo faunal data are compared with those from a number of other Kansyore sites. Pundo confirms that early Kansyore sites are purely forager sites, with domestic caprines only appearing at late Kansyore sites (post-dating ca. 4400 cal. BP). Comparing ethological data for fish taxa found at Pundo and other lakeshore shell middens with those for fish taxa found at larger riverside sites, a seasonal round is suggested, in which short-term fishing camps such as Pundo may have been occupied in the dry season, while riverside sites were probably occupied during the rainy season.

Geochemical and bioaccumulation behavior of these chemicals also appears to be related to the presence of black carbon (BC) in sediment. In situ PCB and PAH biota to sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) for benthic invertebrates, as well as 6h Tenax-extractable (fast-desorbing) concentrations and lake characteristics (including BC in sediment), were determined for different seasons in chemically similar but ecologically different lakes (fish-dominated turbid, algae-dominated turbid, and macrophyte-dominated). BSAFs could be explained with a model including a term for Freundlich sorption to BC and a term for uptake from fast-desorbing concentrations in ingested sediments. Freundlich coefficients for in situ sorption to BC (K-F) were calculated from slow desorbing fractions and BC contents and agreed well with literature values for K-F. Furthermore, in contrast to BSAFs based on total extracted concentrations, Tenax-based BSAF showed a strong positive correlation with log K-OW. We therefore argue that BC caused slow desorption and limited BSAFs in these lakes. Seasonal and lake effects on BSAFs were detected, while the differences between oligochaetes and other invertebrates were small for PCBs and within a factor of 10 for PAHs. BSAFs for pyrogenic PAHs were much lower than for PCBs, which was explained by stronger sorption to BC and lesser uptake from ingested sediment.					; Koelmans, Albert/D-8603-2014	Koelmans, Albert/0000-0001-7176-4356; Moermond, Caroline/0000-0002-9770-7023; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 1	2005	39	9					3101	3109		10.1021/es048079l	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es048079l								15926558					WOS:000228781700040

Sedimentologic (magnetic susceptibility, organic and inorganic carbon content) and environmental indicators (pollen, diatoms, ostracodes and stable isotopes on ostracodes) show lake levels markedly higher than today during the early Holocene, following a rapid lake-level rise after a desiccation phase prior to 11000 BP. After about 6000 BP, lake levels were generally lower, but underwent repeated fluctuations. These inferred changes support the previously proposed view that the southern westerly stormtracks were focused (zonal) north of latitude 50degreesS during the early Holocene, allowing for Antarctic cold fronts to bring easterly moisture to southern Patagonia, whereas during the late Holocene the stormtracks shifted seasonally, with an overall more meridional behaviour, resulting in less and more variable moisture at these latitudes.					; Gilli, Adrian/B-5238-2014; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022; Burns, Stephen/H-9419-2013	Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; Gilli, Adrian/0000-0003-4193-2157; Maidana, Nora/0000-0002-1429-4834; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2003	13	4					581	591		10.1191/0959683603hl648rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl648rp													WOS:000183579300012

Previous AB risk assessments have focused on the potential occurrence of ABs and related factors in the growing season, whereas their hazards, especially in the pre-growing season, have attracted less attention. Here, we performed a comprehensive AB risk assessment, including water trophic levels, phytoplankton biomass, functional trait-based assemblages, and related environmental factors, in the pre-growing season in Dongting Lake, China. Although mesotrophic water and low phytoplankton biomass suggested low AB potential, toxic taxa, which constituted 13.28% of the phytoplankton biomass, indicated non-negligible AB hazards. NH4+ and water temperature were key factors affecting phytoplankton motility and toxicity. Our study establishes a new paradigm for quantitative AB risk assessment, including both potential AB occurrence and hazards. We emphasize the importance of phytoplankton functional traits for early AB warning and NH4+ reduction for AB control in the pre-growing season.

J	Amacker, TM; Alford, JB				Amacker, Todd M.; Alford, J. Brian			Selective predation by reintroduced juvenile Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in Ft. Loudoun reservoir, Tennessee (USA)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Following water quality and minimum flow improvements to the impounded Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have been restocked annually since 2000. Our goal was to seasonally assess foraging mode of this recovering population in Ft. Loudoun Reservoir in the Upper Tennessee River. During 2014-15, individuals were captured using trot-lines in a 13-km reach that supports the greatest density of lake sturgeon. We used colonic flushing and gastric lavage techniques to obtain diet. We took systematic benthic sediment grabs along multiple transects throughout the reach and opportunistically deployed rock cages filled with hard substrates to assess potential prey that colonize hard surfaces. Foraging modes of lake sturgeon were determined by comparing relative abundances of invertebrate taxa in the gut contents (6581 invertebrates) of 28 fish to the relative abundances of the same invertebrate taxa collected from the resource base (1667 invertebrates). Proportional similarity, Levin's niche breadth, and Manly's index were used to assess the degree of prey selectivity. Lake sturgeon fed selectively on a narrow range of available prey consisting mostly of larval chironomids (93% composition by number during warm season, 96% during cool season), some genera of which they prey upon selectively, primarily Chironomus sp., but to a lesser extent Procladius, Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, and Cryptochironomus spp. Meanwhile, other abundant taxa in the resource base were avoided, such as Oligochaetes, Hexagenia mayflies, and the chironomid Glyptotendipes. Our results illustrate that assessing seasonally available prey from habitat utilized by lake sturgeon is important when investigating diet preference.

J	Tsujimoto, K; Koike, T				Tsujimoto, Kumiko; Koike, Toshio			Land-lake breezes at low latitudes: The case of Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Tonle Sap Lake is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. During the postmonsoon season, a small linear cloud system has been observed over this lake in early morning, while the sky above the surrounding land is clear. Although this cloud system is apparently generated by land breezes, previous studies on land-lake (sea) circulation have suggested that environmental factors at low latitudes inhibit development of nocturnal land breezes. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of these early morning clouds through numerical simulation. The simulations show a linear updraft system over the lake, forming along the southwest lakeshore around 22:00 and moving northeast to the middle of the lake. The heavier air mass from the land meets the extraordinarily warm and humid air mass over the lake, triggering updrafts under the conditionally convective instability. The characteristic high surface water temperature was favorable for generation of the land breeze and updraft systems. That high surface water temperature of the lake is produced by the tropical climate along with efficient energy absorption because of the shallowness of the water body. This unique feature can generate a clear nocturnal land breeze circulation accompanying a migrating updraft system over the lake despite its low latitude.

The increase in Ra-226 specific activity and the runoff from September to December in 2006 is used to estimate the total discharge of groundwater along the mid-lower reaches of the Changjiang River. The total groundwater discharge was found to account for 31% of the increased discharge between Yichang and Datong. The groundwater discharge to lakes (i.e. Dongting Lake) constituted the major contribution of groundwater discharge to the mid-lower reaches of the Changjiang River. More importantly, the second impounding operation of the Three Gorges Dam from 20 September to 27 October 2006 induced a water level decrease in surrounding lakes and rivers, which led to an additional groundwater discharge of 63.3 x 10(8) m(3), accounting for 85% of the total groundwater discharge in the same period. Taken together, these observations indicate that groundwater discharge along the mid-lower reaches plays an important role in maintaining stream flow in the drought season, especially in extreme drought years or in response to human activities.

Contaminants of emerging concern may pose prezygotic barriers to freshwater mussel recruitment	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Increased detection of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin has raised concern about the impact CECs may have on aquatic life. In particular, the impacts of CECs on the highly imperiled freshwater mussels (family: Unionidae) have not yet been assessed. Contaminants may alter reproductive success during either the pre- or postzygotic stages of reproduction and lead to population declines. This study sought to address possible disruption of prezygotic processes while acknowledging the complexity of CEC mixtures in nature. River waters from sites with dominant urban and agricultural land use in the Milwaukee River Basin and Lower Maumee River Basin respectively were used as treatments during 21-day exposures of adult Lampsilis cardium, Lampsilis siliquoidea, and Eurynia dilatata. At the conclusion of exposures, the development of gonad tissue was histologically examined to address deviations from expected seasonal development as a barrier to recruitment. No abnormalities in development were found compared to control waters. Sperm densities were also examined; and, though no significant differences were found among treatments, lampsiline species sperm density tended to increase along the gradient of CEC mixture complexity while E. dilatata sperm density correlated positively with a lower concentration of pharmaceuticals, especially antibiotics, despite increased pesticide detection. Given the complexity of natural occurring CEC mixtures and variable unionid response, future work may utilize these data to elucidate combinations of CECs most likely to create impacts on gametogenesis which could lead to further population declines.

Seismic expressions of shallow gas in the lacustrine deposits of Lake Balaton, Hungary	NEAR SURFACE GEOPHYSICS												Lake Balaton, a large shallow lake in Central Europe (Hungary), has been the site of extensive ultra-high-resolution acoustic and multichannel seismic profiling in the period of 1997-2013. These surveys showed the widespread occurrence of shallow gas in the lake sediments and their immediate substrata. We analyzed about 2000 km of two-dimensional profiles and mapped the different gas occurrences in the uppermost 20 m. The anomalies caused by free gas were identified, classified, and assigned to upper, middle and lower levels based on gas signatures and stratigraphic position. Monitoring of the uppermost gas front has revealed temporal variations between surveys from different years and seasons that manifested in the changes of free gas content in the upper two levels. Free gas in the lower part of the lake sediments and at around the base of the mud indicated greater stability. The different nature of the three free gas levels can be explained by vertical changes in quantity, production rate, and solubility of methane and carbon dioxide gases. We suggest that methane was derived from the microbial decomposition of organic matter in the mud and Pleistocene peat at the base of the mud, whereas CO2 is transported to the lower mud layers by upwelling fluids.

Specialized morphology for a generalist diet: evidence for Liem's Paradox in a cichlid fish	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The stable isotope ratio and seasonal changes in diet of Alluaud's haplo Astatoreochromis alluaudi, a cichlid fish with massive pharyngeal jaws well known for its ability to process hard-bodied prey, are described. The diet of A. alluaudi was quantified in Lake Saka, Uganda, over a period of 30 months. Variation in physico-chemical variables (mean monthly rainfall, water temperature, turbidity and dissolved oxygen), as well as potential competitor density and food abundance, was measured throughout the second half of the study (14 months). Stomach contents and isotope analysis revealed a diet comprised mainly of fishes and insects, with a low contribution of molluscs (0-33%) in any given month. No correlation was detected between diet and either macroinvertebrate abundance or competitor abundance. The running average rainfall was positively related to the percentage of fish consumed per month. Although A. alluaudi exhibits an apparent molluscivorous trophic morphology in Lake Saka, molluscs did not appear to compose a major portion of its diet. Gradients of rainfall seemed to be the most important environmental predictor of diet choice in Lake Saka. These results are discussed with reference to Liem's Paradox that apparently morphologically specialized fishes often function as generalist feeders in the wild.

Adding complexity to this problem, disturbance regimes and the distribution/competitive interactions of participating species may vary in time with shifts in mean climatic conditions and variability. Here we present results from sediment cores we collected from small closed-basin lakes near the Pacific coast of central Isla Grande de Chiloe<acute accent>, a sector with the lowest seasonality and recurrence of explosive volcanic events in Northwestern Patagonia (NWP). Our aim is examining vegetation development since the last glaciation and exploring potential climatic and disturbance impacts. We found rapid establishment of closed-canopy rainforests, which have persisted with little variation in terms of physiognomy until the present. Significant changes in species composition, structure, dynamics, and rates of change are evident over the last -18,000 years, along with fire maxima at -16.7 ka, -12.7 ka, between -11.7-9 ka, from -2 ka to the present, and minima in the interim. Fires precede major increases in disturbance favored taxa, which correspond in timing with fire activity maxima at NWP scale. The most recent -2000 years coincide with the highest number and ubiquity of human occupations at central-west and NWP scale, raising the possibility that fires were driven by human activities near our study sites. We detect a conspicuous increase in disturbance-favored trees -150 years after deposition of the Puma Verde Tephra (-8.3 ka) and interpret their subsequent maintenance by frequent blowdown events after -7.5 ka in exposed sectors of the Coastal Range. We posit that enhanced storminess driven by stronger Southern Westerly Winds since -7.5 ka has favored early successional opportunistic trees in detriment of old-growth forests dominated by shade-tolerant species, generating a spatial mosaic of forest patches or gaps in different stages of recovery.

Hypolimnetic phosphorus and nitrogen dynamics in a small, eutrophic lake with a seasonally anoxic hypolimnion	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In situ estimates of sediment nutrient flux are necessary to understand seasonal variations in internal loading in lakes. We investigated the sources and sinks of nutrients in the hypolimnion of a small (0.33 km(2)), relatively shallow (18 m max. depth), eutrophic lake (Lake Okaro, New Zealand) in order to determine changes in sediment nutrient fluxes resulting from a whole lake sediment capping trial using a modified zeolite phosphorus inactivation agent (Z2G1). Sediment nutrient fluxes in the hypolimnion were estimated as the residual term in a nutrient budget model that accounted for mineralisation of organic nutrients, nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and mixing, nitrification, adsorption/desorption and diffusion of dissolved nutrients at the thermocline. Of the total hypolimnetic phosphate and ammonium fluxes during one period of seasonal stratification (2007-08), up to 60 and 50%, respectively, were derived from the bottom sediments, 18 and 24% were due to mineralisation of organic species, 36 and 28% were due to phytoplankton uptake and 9 and 6% were from diffusion across the thermocline. Adsorption/desorption of phosphate to suspended solids and nitrification were of minor (< 8%) importance to the total fluxes. Any reduction in sediment nutrient release by Z2G1 was small compared with both the total sediment nutrient flux and the sum of other hypolimnetic fluxes. Uneven sediment coverage of Z2G1 may have been responsible for the limited effect of the sediment capping layer formed by Z2G1.

Filamentous Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacteria in Microbial Communities of the Kulunda Steppe Soda Lakes (Altai Krai, Russia)	MICROBIOLOGY												Soda lakes are relic ecosystems inhabited by unique microorganisms, which are doubly extremophilic: both haloalkaliphilic and natronophilic. Two morphologically and physiologically similar monocultures of filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (FAPB) were isolated from the water samples and biofilms on plants of the coastal zones of the steppe soda lakes Tanatar 6 and Gorchina 1 (Kulunda, Altai krai) during the season of their desalination. In their natural environments, FAPB coexisted with anoxygenic purple sulfur bacteria of the genera Chromatium,Thiocapsa, Ectothiorhodospira, and Thiorhodospira, as well as with oxygenic phototrophs (alkaliphilic cyanobacteria, euglenophytes, and diatoms). FAPB formed filaments surrounded by thin sheaths; their cells contained antenna structures (chlorosomes). Apart from small amounts of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a in the reaction center, both isolates contained also antenna BChl c and BChl d. Alpha- and beta-carotenes and their derivatives were also detected. FAPB grew well in the medium containing Na2S center dot 9H(2)O (500 mg/L) at total mineralization of 15-30 g/L and pH 8-9.5. Identification of both cultures based on amino acid composition of the PufLM complex revealed that they belonged to the phylum Chloroflexi and were almost 100% identical both to each other and to the halo-alkaliphilic isolate "Candidatus Viridilinea mediisalina" Kir15-3F revealed previously in the Kiran soda lake (Eastern Siberia, Russia). It may be concluded that "Cand. Viridilinea mediisalina" is a typical component of Siberian soda lakes with moderate salinity.

Its worldwide expansion is a major concern for plant health. We have collected all bibliographical references, phytosanitary reports and authentic photographic evidence from entomological websites to determine the worldwide distribution of T. campestris. The theoretical directions of the spreading and actually occupied area of this arthropod pest were determined over the whole Holarctic range. Furthermore, the potential distribution area was calculated using cumulated temperature in the growing season averaged over 15 years both in the Palearctic and Nearctic regions. Holarctic expansion of the species, including the main parts of North America and Eurasia, is clearly indicated. Its populations occur in 29 countries to date, supported by documentation from 64 publications and 30 online forums. Its spread is continuously westward in the Palearctic; in the Nearctic, the spread was first southward from the Great Lakes region then eastward from Utah. The species has excellently adapted to circumstances of freight by ship and plane, as wood is often used, ensuring optimal conditions for the pest. In addition, the active spreading achieved by flying is an important factor contributing to its expansion. The primary criterion for controlling the species would be the introduction of a monitoring system in affected and exposed areas.

J	Bhatia, M; Sharp, M; Foght, J				Bhatia, Maya; Sharp, Martin; Foght, Julia			Distinct bacterial communities exist beneath a high arctic polythermal glacier	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Bacterial communities reside in basal ice, sediment, and meltwater in the supra-, sub-, and proglacial environments of John Evans Glacier, Nunavut, Canada. We examined whether the subglacial bacterial community shares common members with the pro- and supraglacial communities, and by inference, whether it could be derived from communities in either of these environments (e.g., by ice overriding proglacial sediments or by in-wash of surface meltwaters). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes amplified from these environments revealed that the subglacial water, basal ice, and sediment communities were distinct from those detected in supraglacial meltwater and proglacial sediments, with 60 of 142 unique terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) detected exclusively in subglacial samples and only 8 T-RFs detected in all three environments. Supraglacial waters shared some T-RFs with subglacial water and ice, likely reflecting the seasonal How of surface meltwater into the subglacial drainage system, whereas supraglacial and proglacial communities shared the fewest T-RFs. Thus, the subglacial community at John Evans Glacier appears to be predominantly autochthonous rather than allochthonous, and it may be adapted to subglacial conditions. Chemical analysis of water and melted ice also revealed differences between the supraglacial and proglacial environments, particularly regarding electrical conductivity and nitrate, sulfate, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Whereas the potential exists for common bacterial types to be broadly distributed throughout the glacial system, we have observed distinct bacterial communities in physically and chemically different glacial environments.

However, CH4 release in form of bubbles (ebullition) is rarely included in current global CH4 emission estimates from lotic ecosystems, due to the lack of reliable models to upscale ebullition. Our study aimed to determine the importance of individual emission pathways (diffusion and ebullition) for total CH4 emissions from a lowland stream with low sediment heterogeneity and explore the relations of ebullition to environmental variables to build a stream ebullition model for this simplified system. We measured CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) diffusive emissions and ebullition from a temperate lowland stream in Czech Republic (Central Europe) during the ice-free season 2021. The studied stream was a significant source of CH4 (mean 260 +/- 107 mg CH4 m-2 day-1), with ebullition as a prevailing pathway of CH4 emission (mean 74 +/- 7%, range 55%-85%) throughout the whole monitored period. CH4 ebullition showed a high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, with sediment temperature and water depth as the strongest predictors, followed by the interaction between flow velocity and sediment temperature. Our model explained 81% of total variance of CH4 ebullition and suggests that it is possible to model ebullitive fluxes in lowland streams with homogeneous sediments. Since CH4 was an important part of the total CO2-equivalent emissions from the examined stream, accounting for mean (+/- SD) 35 +/- 7.4%, and ebullition the majority of the CH4 emission, the ability to adequately model ebullition is pertinent for lowland streams. Streams and rivers are one of the natural sources of methane (CH4), an important greenhouse gas. CH4 can be released from water by two different emission pathways-by diffusion and by ebullition (in the form of bubbles). The magnitude of CH4 emissions from streams, especially the release of bubbles, considerably varies between streams or stream sections, and between seasons. Therefore, it is challenging to estimate and model the ebullitive CH4 emissions from streams with high reliability and include them properly in current global CH4 emission estimates from natural ecosystems. We studied the importance of individual CH4 emission pathways and their relations to environmental factors in a lowland stream with low variability in sediment characteristics, such as grain size, and carbon or nitrogen content. We found that CH4 bubble emissions were the dominant pathway of CH4 emissions from the stream and its magnitude was mainly related to sediment temperature, water depth, and velocity of the stream flow. Our model explained most of the CH4 bubble emissions variability and suggests that it is possible to model CH4 bubble emissions in lowland streams, where CH4, next to carbon dioxide, is an important part of greenhouse gas emissions. Ebullition was the dominant CH4 emission pathway from a temperate lowland stream Temperature, water depth, and flow velocity were the strongest predictors of CH4 ebullition CH4 ebullition can be modeled with high reliability in lowland streams with homogeneous sediments					Bednařík, Adam/AAP-6295-2020; Darenova, Eva/G-1563-2014														2169-8953	2169-8961				MAY	2024	129	5							e2023JG007597	10.1029/2023JG007597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JG007597													WOS:001208023600001

Asian swamp eels (Synbranchidae, Monopterus) in Florida: distribution, spread, and range of hydrologic tolerance over twenty-seven years (1997-2023)	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Asian swamp eels (Monopterus albus / javanensis) were first reported as introduced to Florida waterbodies in 1997 near Tampa and Miami; a third population was recorded by 1999 in Homestead. Initial assessments, published soon after swamp eels in southern Florida were first recorded in wetlands beyond canals and ponds (in 2007), concluded there was little threat to Florida's aquatic ecosystems. Long-term data now suggest they precipitated population crashes of crayfishes and small fishes in the eastern Everglades. We used records from continuous long-term monitoring programs, sporadic monitoring studies, and online databases to reconstruct swamp eel presence across Florida. Monitoring studies provided wetland hydrologic variables to assess limits for swamp eels. From 1997-2007, populations in southern Florida remained restricted to canals; initial spread from 2007-2017 across southern Everglades National Park proceeded slowly and the two populations covered similar to 1500 km(2) of southern Florida. From 2017-2022, the rate of spread increased as they spread west and north (similar to 5800 km(2) range). Through 2014, the Tampa population occurred only along southern/eastern Tampa Bay (similar to 60 km(2)) but has since spread south along the Gulf Coast, east into central Florida, and south along the Lake Wales Ridge (similar to 11,000 km(2)). We found evidence of two potentially new introductions, in Palm Beach County and Orlando. There was no clear evidence of limitation of wetland drying on swamp eel occurrence in the Everglades; they were captured in marshes that dried for 1-5 months during the previous dry season, but short-hydroperiod wetlands may have slowed spread. In the Everglades, evidence suggests swamp eels may have been inadvertently spread into marshes from canals used to deliver water for flood control and hydrologic restoration. Swamp eels are currently spreading unchecked across Florida, and there should be great concern about continued spread in this region and their establishment and spread elsewhere.					; Pintar, Matthew/AAP-1876-2020	Pintar, Matthew/0000-0003-0165-3882; Dorn, Nathan/0000-0001-5516-0253; 													1798-6540	1818-5487				MAY	2024	19	2					233	258		10.3391/ai.2024.19.2.124660	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2024.19.2.124660													WOS:001262145500006

Underway pCO2 Surveys Unravel CO2 Invasion of Lake Superior From Seasonal Variability	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												This study observed seasonal trends and inferred drivers of CO2 biogeochemistry at the air-water interface of Lake Superior. Underway carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) was measured in surface water during 69 transects spanning ice free seasons of 2019-2022. These data comprise the first multiannual pCO(2) time series in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Surface water pCO(2) was closely tied to increasing atmospheric pCO(2) over a 100-day CO2 equilibration timescale, while seasonal variability was controlled equally by thermal and non-thermal drivers during the ice-free season. Comparison to previous modeling efforts indicated that Lake Superior surface pCO(2) increased with two decades of rising atmospheric CO2. Spatial heterogeneity in CO2 dynamics was highlighted by a conductivity-based delineation of "riverine" and "pelagic" regimes, each of which was associated with net CO2 influx over Julian days 100-300 on the order of 25 Gmol C. These findings refine previous estimates of Lake Superior C fluxes, support predictions of anthropogenic CO2 invasion during the ice-free season, point to new observation strategies for large lakes, and highlight an urgent need for studies of changes to lacustrine C cycling.

However, current forecasting methods mainly emphasize temporal variations, ignoring key influencing factors such as seasonality and environmental changes. In addition, the complex structure of neural networks complicates the selection of ideal hyperparameters. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel squeezing -andexcitation temporal gated recurrent unit (SE-TGRU) method. By incorporating squeezing -and -excitation attention modules, this method autonomously assesses the relative significance of diverse historical time points, unveiling their correlations to capture essential information about coal consumption. Notably, a novel reverse learning -based dwarf mongoose optimization (RL-DMO) algorithm is devised to comprehensively analyze data within a specified time window. This augmentation enhances the ability of the model to discern data anomalies with heightened sensitivity, enabling corresponding adjustments during the training process. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method in coal consumption forecasting is verified through extensive experimentation using actual data sourced from the procurement department of a salt lake enterprise. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits an 11 % improvement in the R -squared (R 2 ) indicator and an 18 % reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared to the baseline method.

This study aimed to document the species composition and evaluate the effect of the flood pulse on the fish community of Amapa Lake, an oxbow lake temporarily connected to the Acre River. Between October 2008 and September 2009, fish were sampled monthly with gill nets, and seven physical-chemical variables were recorded at three sampling stations along the lake. The fish community structure and physical-chemical variables were compared among the hydrological phases of pre-flooding, minor and major flood and post-flooding, and the degree of association between the limnological characteristics and species composition was explored with a canonical correspondence analysis. A total of 2131 specimens belonging to 53 species were captured. The numerical abundance and biomass of fish and water temperature were higher in the pre and post-flooding phases. Samples of the pre-flooding phase comprised more than 40% of the overall numerical abundance (115 ind. 1000 m(2) 24 h(-1) +/- 16 se) and biomass (9949 g 1000 m(2) 24 h(-1) +/- 1.816 se) due to the greater dominance of few species, mainly small (the Siluriformes Hypoptopoma gulare) to medium sized (the Characiformes Triportheus curtus) during low waters. With the onset of the minor flood, conductivity decreased and depth increased in the lake, whereas total phosphorous and pH reduced significantly at major flood. The composition and abundance of fish community changed more among hydrological phases than species richness and 26% of this annual variability in the biotic component was shaped exclusively by the physical-chemical variables. As fish community and physical-chemistry of the Amapa Lake undergo to the hydrological cycle of the Acre River, these results reinforce the general pattern of predictable seasonal alterations in the functioning of tropical floodplains. Based on the general decrease in dominance during the long flood pulse and the occurrence of piscivorous migrators among the five most abundant species, we conclude that the seasonal variation in the hydrometric level of the Acre River plays an important role in maintaining the high fish diversity obseived in the Amapa Lake all year round.

J	Borek, L				Borek, Lukasz			EUTROPHICATION RISK OF WATER IN THE MANOR-PARK CHANNELS: DIFFERENT WAYS OF EVALUATION	CARPATHIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The problem of water eutrophication of the shallow water reservoirs is known about for some considerable time. Monitoring of surface water quality in the canals and ditches is an important part of the diagnosis process of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems. There are several ways to assess water eutrophication. In this paper, assessment of water eutrophication based on diversity of macrophytes, index of trophic state and nutrients in the irrigation system of the manor-park complex in Bren (the south of Poland) is presented. The irrigation system constituting an integral part of the manor-park complex (from the 18th century) consists of open channels with a total length of about 1400 m with a total surface area 15 000 m(2). The water artificial watercourses with macrophytes can fulfill the role of the constructed wetland system which affected to the reduction in concentration of biogens in water flowing away from the irrigation system. The knowledge about the processes of self-purification is important for the management of small water reservoir like canals or ditches, where "water blooms" are frequent. The water analysis of surface water carried out during the vegetation seasons (from March to October) in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the three measurment-control points situated in the supply ditch, the main park channel and the discharge channel. The concetration of amonium nitrogen (N-NH4+), nitrite nitrogen (N-NO2), nitrate nitrogen (N-NO3-), phosphate-phosphorus (P-PO43-) and also pH values, oxygen saturation and water temperature were assessed. Macrophytes inventories were carried out during the vegetation season of 2017, on five sections of channels and ditches. The results of the research showed a positive effect of the irrigation system in the park on the aquatic ecosystems. The results confirmed that the water in the canals has a eutrophic state, but as a result of slow water flow and macrophytes presence (e.g. Typha latyfolia, Lemna minor, Sparganium ramosum) causeed statistically signitifance decrease of biogenic compounds. It means that the presented a three ways of evaluation eutrophication risk of water may be successfully used to monitoring of surface water in the shallow water reservoirs like canals, ditches or ponds with controlled flow of water.

J	Ohtaka, A				Ohtaka, Akifumi			Aquatic oligochaete fauna (Annelida, Clitellata) in Lake Tonle Sap and adjacent waters in Cambodia	LIMNOLOGY												In surveys conducted during 2000-2005, 39 taxa of aquatic oligochaetes belonging to the families Enchytraeidae and Naididae were found in Lake Tonle Sap in the Mekong River Basin, Cambodia. Dominated by naidines and pristinines (29 taxa), they mainly comprised widely distributed species as well as South Asian and Southeast Asian species. Among the four areas studied, the littoral regions of the lake-where inundated forests and aquatic vegetation developed during the flooded seasons-presented the highest number of species. Submerged vegetation in the littoral Lake Tonle Sap harbored abundant epiphytic oligochaetes, especially Stylaria fossularis. In contrast to the rich abundance of naidine and pristinine fauna, tubificines and ryhacodrilines were scarce in and around the lake, irrespective of the vegetation in their habitats. Several Aulodrilus species and Branchiura sowerbyi were the main representatives of the benthic oligochaete assemblages throughout the offshore zone of the lake without vegetation. It is noteworthy that the widely distributed tubificines Tubifex tubifex and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri were not found in any surveyed locality.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2018	19	3					367	373		10.1007/s10201-018-0543-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0543-5													WOS:000439148900010

The role of mobile consumers in lake nutrient cycles: a brief review	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We summarise current understanding of consumer recycling in lake nutrient cycles and expand on it by integrating emerging knowledge from food web ecology. The role of consumer nutrient recycling (CNR) is initially framed in the wider context of lake nutrient cycling, which includes hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes, and their responses to global environmental change. Case studies are used to demonstrate that effects of CNR on lake ecosystems range widely, from reduced nutrient cycling rates to exacerbation of eutrophication. CNR depends on consumer biomass, body size and diet, remaining relatively consistent through the year and becoming important as other fluxes seasonally ebb. Universal patterns in food web structure, for example, consumer-resource biomass ratios, body size scaling and relationships between trophic level and diet breadth, are used to demonstrate the predictability of CNR effects. Larger, mobile, top predators excrete nutrients at a lower rate but over a wider range, linking nutrient cycles across habitats. Smaller-bodied, lower trophic level consumers have strong localised nutrient cycling effects associated with their limited mobility. Global environmental-change drivers that alter food web structure are likely to have the greatest impact on CNR rates and should direct future studies.					; Hamilton, David/F-5039-2012; Duggan, Ian/G-2275-2012; Stewart, Simon/M-3316-2016; Stewart, Simon/JPX-8611-2023; Baisden, Troy/B-9831-2008; Hamilton, David P/F-5039-2012	Stewart, Simon/0000-0003-1916-5481; Stewart, Simon/0000-0001-9032-8998; Hamilton, David P/0000-0002-9341-8777													0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2018	818	1					11	29		10.1007/s10750-018-3603-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3603-2													WOS:000433197400002

While long periods of asexual reproduction allow some clones to outcompete others, and may result in "clonal erosion", sexual reproduction restores genetic variation in such systems. Moreover, sexual reproduction may result in the formation of interspecific hybrids. These hybrids can then reach high abundances, through asexual clonal reproduction. In the present study, we explored genetic variation in water fleas of the genus Daphnia. The focus was on the short-term dynamics within several clonal assemblages from the hybridizing Daphnia longispina complex and the impact of gene flow at small spatial scales. Results: Daphnia individuals belonged either to the parental species D. galeata and D. longispina, or to different hybrid classes, as identified by 15 microsatellite markers. The distribution and genotypic structure of parental species, but not hybrids, corresponded well with the geographical positions of the lakes. Within parental species, the genetic distance among populations of D. galeata was lower than among populations of D. longispina. Moreover, D. galeata dominance was associated with higher phosphorous load. Finally, there was no evidence for clonal erosion. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the contemporary structure of hybridizing Daphnia communities from ten nearby lakes is influenced by colonization events from neighbouring habitats as well as by environmental factors. Unlike the parental species, however, there was little evidence for successful dispersal of hybrids, which seem to be produced locally. Finally, in contrast to temporary Daphnia populations, in which a decrease in clonal diversity was sometimes detectable over a single growing season, the high clonal diversity and lack of clonal erosion observed here might result from repeated hatching of sexually produced offspring. Overall, our study provides insights into spatio-temporal dynamics in a hybridizing Daphnia species complex in a recently established lake system, and relates genetic similarities of populations to a scenario of secondary invasion enhanced by environmental factors.					; Yin, Mingbo/E-3677-2017; Wolinska, Justyna/N-6455-2014	Yin, Mingbo/0000-0002-0742-5031; Wolinska, Justyna/0000-0003-2913-2923; 													1471-2148					APR 12	2014	14								80	10.1186/1471-2148-14-80	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-14-80								24725969					WOS:000335852700001

J	Drewes, F; Peter, H; Sommaruga, R				Drewes, Fabian; Peter, Hannes; Sommaruga, Ruben			Are viruses important in the plankton of highly turbid glacier-fed lakes?	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Viruses are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems where they significantly contribute to microbial mortality. In glacier-fed turbid lakes, however, viruses not only encounter low host abundances, but also a high number of suspended mineral particles introduced by glacier meltwaters. We hypothesized that these particles potentially lead to unspecific adsorption and removal of free virus from the plankton, and thus significantly reduce their abundance in this type of lake. We followed the distribution of free virus-like particles (VLP) during the ice-free season across a turbidity gradient in four alpine lakes including one adjacent clear system where hydrological connectivity to the receding glacier is already lost. In the glacier-fed turbid lakes, VLP abundance increased with distance to the glacier, but the highest numbers were observed in the clear lake by the end of August, coinciding with the maximum in prokaryotic abundance. Our results suggest that viral loss by attachment to particles is less important than expected. Nevertheless, the relatively lower variability in VLP abundance and the lower virus-to-prokaryote ratio found in the turbid lakes than in the clear one point to a rather low temporal turnover and thus, to a reduced impact on microbial communities.					; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011	Peter, Hannes/0000-0001-9021-3082; Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461													2045-2322					APR 20	2016	6								24608	10.1038/srep24608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep24608								27094854					WOS:000374377100003

We show that genetic differentiation of Microcystis colonies based on rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences provides an adequate basis for recognition of microcystin producers. Consequently, ecological studies of toxic and nontoxic cyanobacteria are now possible through studies of rRNA ITS genotypic diversity in isolated cultures or colonies and in natural communities. A total of 107 Microcystis colonies were isolated from 15 lakes in Europe and Morocco, the presence of microcystins in each colony was examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and they were grouped by rRNA ITS denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) typing. Based on DGGE analysis of amplified ITSa and ITSc fragments, yielding supplementary resolution (I. Janse et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 69:6634-6643, 2003), the colonies could be differentiated into 59 classes. Microcystin-producing and non-microcystin-producing colonies ended up in different classes. Sequences from the rRNA ITS of representative strains were congruent with the classification based on DGGE and confirmed the recognition of microcystin producers on the basis of rRNA ITS. The rRNA ITS sequences also confirmed inconsistencies reported for Microcystis identification based on morphology. There was no indication for geographical restriction of strains, since identical sequences originated from geographically distant lakes. About 28% of the analyzed colonies gave rise to multiple bands in DGGE profiles, indicating either aggregation of different colonies, or the occurrence of sequence differences between multiple operons. Cyanobacterial community profiles from two Dutch lakes from which colonies had been isolated showed different relative abundances of genotypes between bloom stages and between the water column and surface scum. Although not all bands in the community profiles could be matched with isolated colonies, the profiles suggest a dominance of nontoxic colonies, mainly later in the season and in scums.

Thus, human obstacles to fish migration like dams and hydropower plants should enable efficient management measures ensuring safe passage for eels during the migration. In order to provide a quick and efficient assessment of eel conservation measure applied to the sluice gates of a large floodplain lake, we implemented a novel evaluation method using predictions on past migration seasons when no management measure were applied. For this purpose, we collected acoustic telemetry monitoring data over three migration seasons and fitted a predictive model based on Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs) to describe the influence of environmental parameters on migration. The water level difference over two days proved to be decisive, along with early migration occasions in the season, as an increase of at least 10 cm water level was associated with a sharp increase of migration probability. We then used the BRT model to predict migration occasions at the dam over 8 past seasons and forecast the impact on escapement of management measures if they had been applied. Thanks to this original prospective assessment of dam management measures, we identified an enhanced opening decision rule, capable of increasing the eel escapement for each year of the study. The management measure is particularly efficient during the years with poor hydrological conditions (i.e. droughts), that is the periods with the lowest initial escapement rates. Finally, efficient management measures to increase silver eel escapement were based on increasing the number of gate opening days by only a few days per year (c.a. 15%). However, the management measure only focused on silver eel migration, so that further investigations should consider the impacts of other threats occurring during the life cycle. This study also provides a highly operational approach for fast evaluation of conservation measures, avoiding lengthy and expensive monitoring campaigns of classical ex-post assessments.					; Eric, Feunteun/GXV-5964-2022; Acou, Anthony/B-1214-2010; Feunteun, Eric/GXV-5964-2022	Acou, Anthony/0000-0001-5166-0912; Eric, Feunteun/0000-0001-6344-6809; Jean-Marc, GILLIER/0000-0003-0626-4894; Carpentier, Alexandre/0000-0002-4013-2660; Trancart, Thomas/0000-0002-1426-7895; Teichert, Nils/0000-0002-8873-9613													1617-1381	1618-1093				JUN	2022	67								126192	10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126192		MAY 2022											WOS:000797886700004

These three large peri-alpine lakes are connected by the Aare River, which is the main tributary to the High Rhine River. Major and trace element analysis of the sediment cores by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) shows that the site of Lake Brienz receives three times more terrigenous elements than the two other studied sites, given by the role of Lake Brienz as the first major sediment sink located in the foothills of the Alps. Overall, the terrigenous fluxes reconstructed at the three studied sites suggest that the construction of sediment-trapping reservoirs during the twentieth century noticeably decreased the riverine suspended sediment load at a regional scale. In fact, the extensive river damming that occurred in the upstream watershed catchment (between ca. 1930 and 1950 and up to 2,300 m a.s.l.) and that significantly modified seasonal suspended sediment loads and riverine water discharge patterns to downstream lakes noticeably diminished the long-range transport of (fine) terrigenous particles by the Aare River. Concerning the transport of anthropogenic pollutants, the lowest lead enrichment factors (EFs Pb) were measured in the upstream course of the Aare River at the site of Lake Brienz, whereas the metal pollution was highest in downstream Lake Biel, with the maximum values measured between 1940 and 1970 (EF Pb > 3). The following recorded regional reduction in aquatic Pb pollution started about 15 years before the actual introduction of unleaded gasoline in 1985. Furthermore, the radiometric dating of the sediment core from Lake Biel identifies three events of hydrological transport of artificial radionuclides released by the nuclear reactor of Muhleberg located at more than 15 km upstream of Lake Biel for the time period 1970-2000.

J	Bucher, EH; Curto, E				Bucher, Enrique H.; Curto, Erio			Influence of long-term climatic changes on breeding of the Chilean flamingo in Mar Chiquita, Crdoba, Argentina	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We report a comparative analysis of the environmental conditions prevailing at each successful breeding event of the Chilean flamingo (Phoenicoptarus chilensis) during the 1969-2010 period in Mar Chiquita, a large salt lake near Crdoba, Argentina. Breeding was monitored annually by air. The following parameters were measured: rainfall, water level water salinity, availability of shoreline and offshore (islands) mudflats, presence of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana), and presence of the Argentine silverside fish (Odonthotestes bonariensis). During the study period, Mar Chiquita underwent great variations in level, reaching the highest level in its geological history. Salinity ranged from 274 down to 22 g l(-1). Artemia was present during the high-salinity periods and was absent when salinity dropped below 55 g l(-1), and the lake was invaded by the silverside. Flamingos bred irregularly during both high- and low-salinity periods (11 successful attempts in 42 years). Comparison of breeding and non-breeding years showed that the only environmental factor always associated with breeding events was availability of mudflats, mostly bordering islands. Water level increases over 0.90 m during the breeding season may flood the nesting areas and affect breeding success. Rapid decreases in lake level may also affect breeding by favoring predation or via nutrient availability. Other factors (water level, water salinity, local rainfall, and presence of Artemia and silverside) were within similar ranges in breeding and non-breeding years. Our surveys provided indirect evidence suggesting that food availability may influence flamingo breeding in Mar Chiquita. Management implications of our study include: (a) habitat suitability analysis of wetlands like Mar Chiquita should consider that availability of offshore mudflats free of vertebrate predators is an essential requirement for flamingo conservation and (b) drastic and rapid increases or decreases in water level due to human control of river inflows may affect chances of successful flamingo breeding and therefore should be evaluated carefully.																			0018-8158					NOV	2012	697	1					127	137		10.1007/s10750-012-1176-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1176-z													WOS:000307886000013
J	Duan, XN; Wang, XK; Mu, YJ; Ouyang, ZY				Duan, XN; Wang, XK; Mu, YJ; Ouyang, ZY			Seasonal and diurnal variations in methane emissions from Wuliangsu Lake in arid regions of China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												CH4 emissions have been widely studied in various wetlands, such as boreal peatlands, rice paddies, and tropical swamps. However, little investigation has been carried out for CH4 emissions from lakes or wetlands in and regions where these freshwaters play a vital role in providing ecosystem services for local people. To quantify the spatial and temporal variations of CH4 flux and understand its key controlling factors in shallow lakes in and regions of Western China, CH4 fluxes from Wuliangsu Lake were measured at different vegetation zones and water depths with a static chamber technique during a growing season from April to October in 2003. Results showed that the average emission flux of CH4 from submerged plant (Potamogeton pectinatus) growing zones was 2.16 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), which was 85.8% lower than that from emergent macrophyte (Phragmites australis) growing zones. CH4 emissions increased with increasing water depth in Phragmites Community. Significant seasonal and diurnal variations of CH4 emission were observed for P. australis during the plant growth stage, for P. pectinatus growing zones, however, the variations were minor. In addition to vegetation cover and water depth, bottom silt temperature and light intensity were also important factors influencing seasonal and diurnal variations of CH4 flux from Phargmites growing zone.

The Tigris-Euphrates Basin (TEB), a major source of dust storms globally, has experienced severe LULC changes. This study assessed the hazardous HDSs within LULC change categories (2000-2020) in TEB by classifying them into from very low to very high hazardousness classes based on the frequency, intensity, and continuity of dust events. The study calculated frequency using the autocorrelation function plot, investigated intensity based on the aerosol optical depth (AOD), and considered continuity by counting consecutive days when a dust event emitted dust with an AOD value >= 0.4. The study found that the most frequent dust events occurred in bare ground and rangeland. Highly intense HDSs occurred in croplands, while dried water beds and seasonal marshes contained more continuous dusts. Also, bare ground included the highest number of hazardous HDSs. The spatial distribution of HDSs showed that the northwestern region of Lake Therthar and the northern deserts of Muthanna Governorate significantly contributed to the formation of hazardous HDSs due to drought and vegetation cover conditions of the region. Sequential pattern mining of the HDSs within LULC changes revealed that transitions between rangeland and bare ground generated the most hazardous HDSs. Conversely, rangeland and bare ground to croplands and rangeland to seasonal marsh were the least hazardous frequent changes. Our observations confirmed that rapid LULC changes, tree cutting, and the drying up of water bodies can exacerbate hazardous dust emissions in the TEB.

Phytobenthos was controlled mainly by light: the highest benthic algal biomass was in the shallow littoral region characterized by large grain size (sand) with good light availability but lower nutrient content in the sediment. During the investigated period, phytoplankton biomass showed a significant decrease in almost the entire lake. At the same time, the biomass of benthic algae increased significantly in the eastern areas, increasing the contribution of total lake microalgae biomass (from 20 % to 27 %). Benthic algal biomass increase can be explained by the better light supply, owing to the artificially maintained high water level which greatly mitigates water mixing. The decrease in planktonic algal biomass could be attributed to increased zooplankton grazing, which is otherwise negatively affected by mixing. As a result of the high water level, the trophic structure of the lake has been rearranged in recent decades with a shift from the planktonic life form to the benthic one while the nutrient supply has largely remained unchanged.					; Krassovan, Krisztina/OHU-5923-2025; Tapolczai, Kálmán/D-3897-2018; Li, Huan/KXR-5795-2024	Somogyi, Boglarka/0000-0003-0900-3315; Li, Huan/0000-0003-1204-8370													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 15	2024	929								172351	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172351		APR 2024						38615783					WOS:001235204600001

Bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) was determined by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the 16S rRNA gene and then evaluated on the basis of physicochemical and biological variables of the lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that BCC of oligotrophic lakes was significantly influenced by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content, but its effect was not apparent in the analysis covering all lakes including mesotrophic and eutrophic ones. The generalized linear model showed the negative association of DOC on the taxon richness of bacterioplankton communities. DOC was positively correlated with the catchment area per lake volume, suggesting that a large fraction of DOC supplied to the lake was derived from terrestrial sources. These results suggest that allochthonous DOC has a significant effect on bacterioplankton communities especially in oligotrophic lakes. The genus Polynucleobacter was detected most frequently. The occurrence of Polynucleobacter species was positively associated with DOC and negatively associated with total phosphorus (TP) levels. In addition, TP had a stronger effect than DOC, suggesting that oligotrophy is the most important factor on the occurrence of this genus.					; Fukui, Manabu/E-1323-2012; Urabe, Jotaro/A-6256-2012; Kojima, Hisaya/D-9100-2012	Iwata, Tomoya/0000-0003-4258-0050; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				APR	2012	63	3					496	508		10.1007/s00248-011-9983-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-011-9983-8								22109097					WOS:000304015200003

Although such infections in marine invertebrates are well documented, they are relatively rarely observed in freshwater invertebrates. Herein, we report a field study using a comprehensive series of methodologies ( histology, dissection, electron microscopy, gene sequence analysis, and molecular phylogenetics) to investigate the morphology, taxonomy, systematics, geographical distribution, pathogenicity, and seasonal and annual prevalence of a haplosporidian observed in zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha. Based on its genetic sequence, morphology, and host, we describe Haplosporidium raabei n. sp. from D. polymorpha - the first haplosporidian species from a freshwater bivalve. Haplosporidium raabei is rare as we observed it in histological sections in only 0.7% of the zebra mussels collected from 43 water bodies across 11 European countries and in none that were collected from 10 water bodies in the United States. In contrast to its low prevalences, disease intensities were quite high with 79.5% of infections advanced to sporogenesis.

Exploring the role of fish in a lake ecosystem (Lake Kinneret, Israel) by coupling an individual-based fish population model to a dynamic ecosystem model	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To explore the role that fish play in aquatic ecosystems, a hydrodynamic ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) was coupled to a novel fish population model. The coupled model (DYCD-FISH) combined two modelling approaches: a complex dynamic model and an individual-based model. The coupled model simulates fish growth population dynamics and predicts fish impacts on various ecosystem components, including nutrients and lower trophic levels. The model was employed to explore the role of the dominant fish in Lake Kinneret (Israel), Acanthobrama terraesanctae (Kinneret bleak, or in Hebrew, lavnun ha'kinneret; hereafter lavnun). Model results suggested that the lavnun has a significant impact (p < 0.05) on the magnitude of output variables including its prey food (the predatory and microzooplankton), major nutrients such as ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4), and on several phytoplankton species, but not on the seasonality of any of the output variables. Since the model incorporates trophic levels from nutrients to fish, it revealed the nonlinear dynamic impacts of fish on different ecosystem components and in particular has led to quantitative insights into the relative influence of top-down control on water quality attributes. Besides being an ecosystem research tool, DYCD-FISH can also be employed as a fishery management tool, and in particular facilitate ecosystem-based fishery management.					; Hipsey, Matthew/C-3551-2009	Hipsey, Matthew/0000-0001-8386-4354; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2011	68	7					1265	1284		10.1139/F2011-051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F2011-051													WOS:000295185400010

NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Diverse abiotic and biotic factors drive the ecological variation of communities across spatial and temporal dimensions. Within the Amazonian landscape, various freshwater environments exhibit distinct physicochemical characteristics. Thus, our study delved into the fluctuations of Odonata assemblages amidst distinct water bodies within Amazonia, encompassing two distinct climatic seasons. Comparative analysis was conducted on Odonata species diversity and assemblage composition across a blackwater pond, a lake, and a stream, spanning the initiation and culmination of the dry season in the southwestern Amazon region in Peru. Our methodology involved capturing adult Odonata using entomological nets on three separate occasions between 11:00 and 14:00 h for each water body in May (beginning of the dry season) and October (end of the dry season) of 2018. We also evaluated the influence of temperature, precipitation, and percent cloud cover on the abundance and richness of adult Odonata. Species richness and composition differed among the three water bodies in both periods of the dry season. No effect of the dry season periods on species richness and abundance was observed. However, except in the oxbow lake, the more abundant species were substituted to the end of the dry season. Our study highlights the influence of water body types on Odonata species diversity and composition. The effects of the sampling period during the dry season may not be immediately apparent in conventional diversity metrics, such as species richness and abundance. Instead, its effects manifest predominantly in the relative abundance of the species that compose these assemblages.

Water samples were collected from October 2020 to September 2021 at three sampling stations in four different seasons. A total of 14 physico-chemical parameters, such as water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, Secchi-depth, nitrate, ammonia, silicon dioxide, soluble reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus, chloride, and fluoride were measured using standard methods. The results demonstrated that seasonal variation existed throughout the study period. Except for turbidity, the water quality of the lake varied significantly within the four seasons (ANOVA, p < 0.05). DO levels decreased significantly during the dry season following water mixing events. Chlorophyll-a measurements exhibit significant seasonal differences ranging from 0.58 mu g L-1 in the main-rainy season to 8.44 mu g L-1 in the post-rainy period, indicating a moderate algal biomass production. The overall category of Lake Ardibo was found to be under a mesotrophic state with medium biological productivity. A holistic lake basin approach management is suggested to maintain water quality and ecological processes and to improve the lake ecosystem services.

Jeremy; Smirnov, Alexander			Augmenting Heritage Ocean-Color Aerosol Models for Enhanced Remote Sensing of Inland and Nearshore Coastal Waters	FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING												Satellite remote sensing of near-surface water composition in terrestrial and coastal regions is challenging largely due to uncertainties linked to a lack of representative continental aerosols in the atmospheric correction (AC) framework. A comprehensive family of absorbing aerosols is proposed by analyzing global AERONET measurements using the Partition Around Medoids (PAM) classifier. The input to the classifier is composed of Version 3, Level 2.0 daily average aerosol properties [i.e., single scattering albedo at & lambda; = 0.44 & mu;m, (SSA(0.44)) and the Angstrom exponents for extinction and absorption AEe(0.44-0.87) and AEa(0.44-0.87), respectively from observations from June 1993 to September 2019. The PAM classification based on low daily aerosol optical depth (AOD(0.44) & LE; 0.4) suggested 27 distinct aerosol clusters encompassing five major absorbing aerosol types (Dust (DU), Marine (MAR), Mixed (MIX), Urban/Industrial (U/I), and Biomass Burning (BB)). Seasonal patterns of dominant PAM-derived clusters at three AERONET sites (GSFC, Kanpur, and Banizoumbou) strongly influenced by U/I, DU, and BB types, respectively, showed a satisfactory agreement with variations of aerosol mixtures reported in the literature. These PAM-derived models augment the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) aerosol models (A2010) applied in its operational AC. To demonstrate the validity and complementary nature of our models, a coupled ocean-atmosphere radiative transfer code is employed to create a simulated dataset for developing two experimental machine-learning AC processors. These two processors differ only in their aerosol models used in training: 1) a processor trained with the A2010 aerosol models (ACI) and 2) a processor trained with both PAM and A2010 aerosol models (ACII). These processors are applied to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) matchups (N = 173) from selected AERONET sites equipped with ocean color radiometers (AERONET-OC). Our assessments showed improvements of up to 30% in retrieving remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the blue bands. In general, our empirically derived PAM aerosol models complement A2010 models (designed for regions strongly influenced by marine conditions) over continental and coastal waters where absorbing aerosols are present (e.g., urban environments, areas impacted by dust, or wildfire events). With the expected geographic expansion of in situ aquatic validation networks (e.g., AERONET-OC), the advantages of our models will be accentuated, particularly in the ultraviolet and short blue bands.

In pursuit of this critical objective, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) monitoring network has been established around the lake to compute real-time station coordinates for deformation monitoring. GNSS Multipath Reflectometry (GNSS-MR) technology has been introduced as an innovative approach, enabling water level retrieval through conventional GNSS geodetic receivers. However, the complex and rugged terrain surrounding Sarez Lake poses challenges to the application of GNSS-MR in this region. This research is dedicated to addressing the challenges posed by the limited available elevation range selection and the retrieval of inter-site water level combinations in such demanding terrain. It proposes a novel method for effectively discerning valid Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) arcs and an inter-site inter-signal water level combination retrieval approach, resulting in a continuous sequence of water level retrievals for this region. The incorporation of remote sensing techniques further facilitates the estimation of water storage fluctuations in the area. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the efficacy of GNSSMR in capturing the lake's seasonal water-level variations, with retrieval uncertainties ranging from centimeters to low decimeters.

The characteristics and skill of the hourly total 'flash origin density' in the 4.4 km Tropical Africa UM were evaluated against Earth Network (EN) lightning observations specifically deployed in the greater Lake Victoria region as part of the HIGHWeather impact lAke sYstem (HIGHWAY) project. Lightning poses a significant risk to fishermen on Lake Victoria, and better forecasts over the lake would be advantageous for the development of better warning systems. The model lightning density was evaluated in two ways: a classical gridded categorical data analysis and the spatial coverage-distance-intensity method. Given the spatial sparseness of the observation type, Gaussian kernel dressing was applied for the latter, to increase the horizontal 'footprint', partly to reflect that lightning can travel horizontally for more than 10 km, and to reduce the representativeness mismatch between the lightning observations and the model forecast lightning density. Considering hourly forecasts, lightning shows a marked diurnal, geographical and seasonal variation over to the west and east of the lake. The model is not producing enough lightning flashes over the lake, nor does it produce enough spatially, especially overnight. The forecast location of lightning shows little skill, with timing differences in the peak, especially over the lake. For warnings, the removal of timing offsets through the creation of a 'maximum-in-the-day' field is considerably less biased and more skilful than using the hourly flash densities.

In 35 headwater catchments (0.07-16.9 km(2)), we sampled stream water every season in 2 years. The water samples were analyzed for NO3-, dissolved nitrous oxide (dN(2)O), and SO(4)(2 -)concentrations. Stream sediment was sampled once for the measurement of denitrification potential (DP). Water-extractable soil organic carbon (WESOC) and easily oxidizable sulfide (EOS) in the sediment, which can be considered the principal potential electron donors for denitrification, were measured. The topographical features of each catchment were calculated using a digital elevation model with 10-m grid cells. Stream NO(3)(-)concentrations displayed large spatial variation among catchments, ranging from 0.06 to 0.52 mg N L-1, and were negatively correlated with topographic wetness index (TWI) (P < 0.01) and were positively correlated with catchment slope (P < 0.01), indicating that NO(3)(-)concentrations decreased in wetter and gentle slope catchments. Sediment DP and the WESOC content in sediments were positively correlated with TWI, significantly. These results suggested denitrification was likely to occur in higher TWI catchments. Generalized linear model showed that TWI, slope aspect, and sediment DP significantly affected in-stream NO(3)(-)concentration and WESOC was a significant explanatory variable for sediment DP. EOS content in riverbed sediments was not selected as a significant explanatory variable for either in-stream NO(3)(-)concentrations or sediment DP. But higher soil DP with higher EOS was detected in the stream bank subsoil at the catchment where the higher EOS content in the riverbed sediment was observed, which suggested EOS in riverbed sediments can contain site-specific information about denitrification hotspot driven by sulfides. We conclude that catchment topography and the distribution of electron donors in riverbed sediment can be important factors to explain the spatial variation in in-stream NO(3)(-)concentration and sediment DP.					; MURANO, Hirotatsu/GMW-9135-2022; Hayakawa, Atsushi/A-5448-2010	Murano, Hirotatsu/0000-0003-3609-9332; 													0038-0768	1747-0765				NOV 1	2020	66	6					906	918		10.1080/00380768.2020.1827292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2020.1827292		OCT 2020											WOS:000579687500001

Quantitative assessment of metal contamination and associated pollution risk in sediments from the Mara River in Tanzania	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												For most rivers in sub-Saharan Africa, information about pollution indices related to sediments is sparse. Sedimentological research of rivers that empty into Lake Victoria is highly patchy and wide apart. The present study determined the levels and associated risk of As, Cd, Cr, Hg, and Pb in sediments collected from four different sites along the Mara River that empties into Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Samples were collected in the dry and rainy months in 2019. Pollution indices, namely geo-accumulation index (I-geo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF), modified contamination degree (mCd), pollution load index (PLI), potential ecological risk factor (E-r(i)), and potential ecological risk index (RI) were used to evaluate the influence of heavy metal contamination in sediments. Dry month mean concentrations, in milligram per kilogram, of heavy metals were as follows: As (11.04 +/- 0.13), Cr (1.02 +/- 0.29), Cd (0.43 +/- 0.05), and Hg (0.01) in the dry month. Respective sediment heavy metal concentrations for the rainy month were 22.22 +/- 0.05 mg As/kg, 3.84 +/- 0.34 mg Pb/kg, 1.53 +/- 0.15 mg Cd/kg, 1.43 mg Cr/kg, and 0.03 mg Hg/kg. Generally, the risk indices showed high values in the rainy month and low values in the dry month, especially for As and Cd-an indication of anthropogenic influence. Correlation coefficient analysis for Pb and Cd showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.99,p < 0.01)-this may suggest a similar source or similar transport behavior. Special attention needs to be paid with regard to rainy season As and Cd enrichment in the study area.

J	Oroud, IM				Oroud, Ibrahim M.			The utility of thermal satellite images and land-based meteorology to estimate evaporation from large lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Evaporation measurements over lakes are limited by physical constraints, logistics and financial demands. Thermal satellite images and land-based meteorology can be combined to derive evaporation rates from large lakes. The Dead Sea is a large hypersaline lake that can be used to examine the utility of thermal satellite images along with land-based meteorology to assess evaporation rates. Sea surface tmperature was retrieved for a 12-month period using band 10 onboard Landsat 8. Monthly SST was combined with nearby land-based meteorology to estimate evaporation from the sea surface using a mass transfer method and two variations of the Penman procedure. The Mass transfer gave an annual evaporation rate of 1005 mm whereas the Penman and the Priestley-Taylor methods gave 1308 and 1140 mm, respectively. These values are commensurate with extensive field measurement and theoretically derived evaporation values. Analysis shows a tradeoff between wind speed increase over the smoother lake surface and the drop in the saturation water vapor pressure deficit across the lake-atmosphere boundary. Wind speed has profound effects on evaporation differences during the warm season but diminish appreciably in the cold season when the vapor pressure deficit is small. Thermal images were able to resolve the presence of large pockets of cool water over the Dead Sea resulting from freshwater input Modifications to evaporation caused by freshwater input to a hypersaline lake are investigated from a thermodynamic perspective. The alteration to evaporation depends on the simultaneous departure of surface temperature and the activity of the brine. (C) 2019 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Scott			Assessment of larval fish assemblages and nursery habitat in the St. Clair River delta	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The St Clair River delta, part of the St Clair-Detroit River System (SCDRS), is the most fished coastal wetland area in the Laurentian Great Lakes and provides nursery habitat for a variety of fish species; however, few large-scale surveys of larval fish have been performed within the delta since the 1980s. Larval fish, zooplankton, and aquatic plants were sampled at 20 sites from May through July in 2010 and 2011 to characterize shallow channel and backwater delta habitats used by fish. The larval fish assemblage was sampled using active and passive gears (conical nets and light traps) and was dominated by Cyprinidae, Catostomidae, and Gobiidae. The microzooplankton assemblage was composed of rotifers, copepod nauplii, and Dreissena spp. veligers, while the macrozooplankton assemblage was composed of mostly cyclopoids and harpacticoids in May and cladocerans later in the season. Scirpus spp. dominated the plant assemblage in June and was replaced by Chara spp. in July. Seasonal compositional shifts were evident for larval fish, zooplankton, and plant assemblages, and greater densities of microzooplankton and cladocerans were typically found in backwater areas. Assemblage compositions were comparable to those in historical surveys but invasive Gobiidae and Dreissena spp. veligers now represent substantial proportions of the larval fish and zooplankton assemblages, respectively. Due to the high connectivity and advective nature of the SCDRS, understanding the larval fish assemblage dynamics of the delta can help inform estimates of system productivity.

For this purpose, some physicochemical parameters, nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton composition were investigated at the lake and its streams. Water samples were collected seasonally from nine sampling sites by using Nansen bottles in May 2017, August 2017, November 2017 and February 2018. Phytoplankton was identified in reference to the literature, including several comprehensive reviews on the subject. Phytoplankton composition of the lake and its feeding streams consists of Bacillariophyta (22), Charophyta (6), Chlorophyta (14), Cryptophyta (2), Cyanobacteria (8), Euglenozoa (8), Miozoa (2) and Ochrophyta (1) division members. As a result of measurements, the minimum and maximum values of some physicochemical parameters and nutrients were as follows; dissolved oxygen (2.01-8.42 mg L-1), pH (7.32-8.85), nitrite (0.014-2.790 mg L-1) and orthophosphate (0.846-69.726 mu g L-1). The results indicated that the basin of Buyukcekmece Dam Lake shows close feature to eutrophic conditions. It is required that, Buyukcekmece Dam Lake and its creeks should be taken under protection continuously for improving its water quality by relevant authorities.

Sulfur isotope signatures in gypsiferous sediments of the Estancia and Tularosa Basins as indicators of sulfate sources, hydrological processes, and microbial activity	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In order to reconstruct paleo-environmental conditions for the saline playa lakes of the Rio Grande Rift, we investigated sediment sulfate sources using sulfur isotope compositions of dissolved SO42- ions in modern surface water, groundwater, and SO42- precipitated in the form of gypsum sediments deposited during the Pleistocene and Holocene in the Tularosa and Estancia Basins. The major sulfate sources are Lower and Middle Permian marine evaporites (delta S-34 of 10.9-14.4 parts per thousand), but the diverse physiography of the Tularosa Basin led to a complex drainage system which contributed sulfates from various sources depending on the climate at the time of sedimentation. As inferred from sulfur isotope mass balance constraints, weathering of sulfides of magmatic/hydrothermal and sedimentary origin associated with climate oscillations during Last Glacial Maximum contributed about 35-50% of the sulfates and led to deposition of gypsum with delta S-34 values of -1.2 parts per thousand to 2.2 parts per thousand which are substantially lower than Permian evaporates. In the Estancia Basin, microbial sulfate reduction appears to overprint sulfur isotopic signatures that might elucidate past groundwater flows. A Rayleigh distillation model indicates that about 3-18% of sulfates from an inorganic groundwater pool (delta S-34 of 12.6-13.8 parts per thousand) have been metabolized by bacteria and preserved as partially to fully reduced sulfur-bearing minerals species (elemental sulfur, monosulfides, disulfides) with distinctly negative delta S-34 values (-42.3 parts per thousand to -20.3 parts per thousand) compared to co-existing gypsum (-3.8 parts per thousand to 22.4 parts per thousand). For the Tularosa Basin microbial sulfate reduction had negligible effect on delta S-34 value of the gypsiferous sediments most likely because of higher annual temperatures (15-33 degrees C) and lower organic carbon content (median 0.09%) in those sediments leading to more efficient oxidation of H2S and/or smaller rates of sulfate reduction compared to the saline playas of the Estancia Basin (5-28 degrees C; median 0.46% of organic carbon). The White Sands region of the Tularosa Basin is frequently posited as a hydrothermal analogue for Mars. High temperatures of groundwater (33.3 degrees C) and high delta O-18(H2O) values (1.1 parts per thousand) in White Sands, however, are controlled predominantly by seasonal evaporation rather than the modern influx of hydrothermal fluids. Nevertheless, it is possible that some of the geochemical processes in White Sands, such as sulfide weathering during climate oscillations and upwelling of highly mineralized waters, might be considered as valid terrestrial analogues for the sulfate cycle in places such as Meridiani Planum on Mars.

This study was carried out in a lake retreat area in the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley, to investigate SOC stock build-up in function of duration of land emergence and SOC dynamics in function of land use and cover changes. Based on an analysis of Landsat imagery (1973,1986 and 2000), coupled with soil and land use studies, determinants for SOC stock were found. Firstly, SOC stock significantly differed between cultivated land and grazing land (3301 and 2626 g m(-2)) on the one hand, and woodland (4594 g m(-2)) on the other. Further, only weak relations were found between SOC stock and vegetation index or IR and green band reflectances, which is related to low canopy density (even in woodland) and low leaf density of Acacia during the dry season. The strongest explanation of SOC stock is related to the duration of emergence and hence of pedogenesis. Its proxy. elevation, explains much of the variability of SOC (R-2=0.48). There is a non-negligible long-term trend of SOC build-up from < 2000 g m(-2) (inherited C-rich limnic sediments) to > 4500 g m(-2) under the climax Acacia-Balanites woodland (on land that emerged approximately 4233-4540 BP). Using a multiple regression model involving elevation and presence of forest or woodland. the SOC stock in the study area could be assessed at 3966 (1799) g m(-2) SOC in 2000, against 4319 (1835) g m(-2) in 1986 and 4199 (1866) g m(-2) in 1973, thereby confirming the rapid SOC depletion after removal of vegetation.

Vulnerability of permafrost carbon to global warming. Part II: sensitivity of permafrost carbon stock to global warming	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												In the companion paper (Part I), we presented a model of permafrost carbon cycle to study the sensitivity of frozen carbon stocks to future climate warming. The mobilization of deep carbon stock of the frozen Pleistocene soil in the case of rapid stepwise increase of atmospheric temperature was considered. In this work, we adapted the model to be used also for floodplain tundra sites and to account for the processes in the soil active layer. The new processes taken into account are litter input and decomposition, plant-mediated transport of methane, and leaching of exudates from plant roots. The SRES-A2 transient climate warming scenario of the IPSL CM4 climate model is used to study the carbon fluxes from the carbon-rich Pleistocene soil with seasonal active-layer carbon cycling on top of it. For a point to the southwest from the western branch of Yedoma Ice Complex, where the climate warming is strong enough to trigger self-sustainable decomposition processes, about 256 kgC m(-2), or 70% of the initial soil carbon stock under present-day climate conditions, are emitted to the atmosphere in about 120 yr, including 20 kgC m(-2) released as methane. The total average flux of CO2 and methane emissions to the atmosphere during this time is of 2.1 kgC m(-2) yr(-1). Within the Yedoma, whose most part of the territory remains relatively cold, the emissions are much smaller: 0.2 kgC m(-2) yr(-1) between 2050 and 2100 for Yakutsk area. In a test case with saturated upper-soil meter, when the runoff is insufficient to evacuate the meltwater, 0.05 kgCH(4) m(-2) yr(-1) on average are emitted as methane during 250 yr starting from 2050. The latter can translate to the upper bound of 1 GtC yr(-1) in CO2 equivalent from the 1 million km(2) area of the Yedoma.

In this study, we developed empirical models of energy density for free-ranging juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha sampled at sea from the west coast of Oregon to Kodiak Island, Alaska, and we evaluated the accuracy of published energy density models commonly used for these species. Our analyses showed that the energy density of juvenile coho and Chinook salmon was strongly correlated to percent dry weight and proximate constituents (especially lipid and, to a lesser extent, protein concentrations) but poorly correlated to body size and condition factor. Percent dry weight of whole fish was the single best predictor of energy density for both species, accounting for more than 90% of the variance in energy density. We also found that percent dry weight in the muscle tissue accounted for 65% of the variance in energy density. Changes in energy density mainly reflected changes in lipid composition. These results indicate that accurate estimates of energy density could be obtained at low effort and cost for juvenile coho and Chinook salmon simply by determining the water contents in whole-fish or muscle samples. Published models overestimate the energy density of juvenile coho and Chinook salmon collected from the Pacific Ocean. This may result from the extrapolation of the models to different size-classes, life stages, or habitats. More caution is needed when models are extrapolated to conditions beyond those that were used for their development.

J	Navarro, MB				Navarro, Marcela Bastidas			Large differences in bacterial community composition of nearby shallow lakes surrounded by Nothofagus pumilio forest in Patagonia (Argentina)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Freshwater ecosystems are integrated in a terrestrial landscape, receiving continuously soil and plant-derived material. In Patagonia, the deciduous beech Nothofagus pumilio constitutes an important source of organic matter for aquatic environments. Here, I attempted to analyze bacterial communities, including genetic diversity and metabolic functioning, in four nearby lakes located under a N. pumilio forest (Chall-Huaco Mountain, Argentina). I combined fieldwork and experiments to assess physicochemical characteristics, bacterial community composition (BCC) and Carbon (C)-consumption. Physicochemical variables analyzed with NMDS showed a clear segregation of all the studied lakes. Similarly, BCC differed among lakes, maintaining its differences regardless of the seasons. Variables that significantly affected bacterial community structuring were dissolved P concentration and protein-like DOM component. The number of specialist operational taxonomic units was higher than that of generalists, but the latter doubled specialists in number of sequences. The last suggests that generalists may be responsible for the differences in BCC among lakes, and species sorting appears to be the main mechanism structuring the metacommunity. These results showed that even at a small geographic scale distinctive bacterial communities can be developed in lakes under the influence of N. pumilio forest.

Predicting the start week of respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks using real time weather variables	BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING												Background: Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), a major cause of bronchiolitis, has a large impact on the census of pediatric hospitals during outbreak seasons. Reliable prediction of the week these outbreaks will start, based on readily available data, could help pediatric hospitals better prepare for large outbreaks. Methods: Naive Bayes (NB) classifier models were constructed using weather data from 1985-2008 considering only variables that are available in real time and that could be used to forecast the week in which an RSV outbreak will occur in Salt Lake County, Utah. Outbreak start dates were determined by a panel of experts using 32,509 records with ICD-9 coded RSV and bronchiolitis diagnoses from Intermountain Healthcare hospitals and clinics for the RSV seasons from 1985 to 2008. Results: NB models predicted RSV outbreaks up to 3 weeks in advance with an estimated sensitivity of up to 67% and estimated specificities as high as 94% to 100%. Temperature and wind speed were the best overall predictors, but other weather variables also showed relevance depending on how far in advance the predictions were made. The weather conditions predictive of an RSV outbreak in our study were similar to those that lead to temperature inversions in the Salt Lake Valley. Conclusions: We demonstrate that Naive Bayes (NB) classifier models based on weather data available in real time have the potential to be used as effective predictive models. These models may be able to predict the week that an RSV outbreak will occur with clinical relevance. Their clinical usefulness will be field tested during the next five years.					; Maloney, Chris/AAF-1931-2019; , Julio/JDM-4514-2023	facelli, julio/0000-0003-1449-477X; Cummins, Mollie/0000-0001-7078-8479; 													1472-6947					NOV 2	2010	10								68	10.1186/1472-6947-10-68	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-10-68								21044325					WOS:000284322600001

For this analysis we used two gill net assessment surveys, one angler creel survey, three salmonid spawning run datasets, one adult sea lamprey assessment, and a bottom trawl assessment of dead lake trout. The frequency of fresh sea lamprey marks observed on lake trout from assessment surveys was strongly related to the frequency of sea lamprey attacks observed on salmon and trout from the creel survey and spawning migrations. Attack frequencies on all salmonids examined were related to the ratio between the abundances of adult sea lampreys and lake trout. Reanalysis of the susceptibility to sea lamprey attack for lake trout strains stocked into Lake Ontario reaffirmed that Lake Superior strain lake trout were among the most and Seneca Lake strain among the least susceptible and that Lewis Lake strain lake trout were even more susceptible than the Superior strain. Seasonal attack frequencies indicated that as the number of observed sea lamprey attacks decreased during June-September, the ratio of healing to fresh marks also decreased. Simulation of the ratios of healing to fresh marks indicated that increased lethality of attacks by growing sea lampreys contributed to the decline in the ratios and supported laboratory studies about wound healing duration.

Relevance of temporal and spatial variability for monitoring the microbiological water quality in an urban bathing area	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The microbiological quality of bathing waters is a fundamental concern for the use of bathing areas. Although the present European Bathing Directive (2006/7/EC) broke new ground in what monitoring, harmonized methods and practices of analysis are concerned, several questions remain unanswered. This study investigated the variation of fecal indicator bacteria of an urban beach area at different spatial and temporal scales. Intensive hourly and spatial sampling was conducted during the most crowded months of the bathing season in order to identify major pollution sources and their influence on the bathing water quality. Temporal variations explained approximately 76% of the overall variability, emphasizing the importance of sample retrieval timing, but also regional events in obtaining reliable results. Although spatial variation explained only 24% of the total variability, it highlighted the fact that the physical and hydrodynamic characteristics of adjacent beach areas, as well as the magnitude of various local inputs also may decisively influence the overall water quality. As a result, small-scale variations of water quality should be identified and accounted when designing the bathing water profiles required by the Directive 2006/7/EC. In order to reduce the public health threats posed by pollution events, water monitoring programs should be planned to be beach specific, especially in areas where these events are more likely to occur.

Parasites and their hosts are assumed to evolve together, however, detailed understanding of mechanisms leading to genetic structuring of parasites and their hosts are lacking. As a parasite depends on its host, studying the genetic structure of both parasite and host can reveal important insights into these mechanisms. Here, genetic structure of the monogenean parasiteGyrodactylus thymalliand its host the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) was investigated in 10 tributaries draining into the large Lake Mjosa in Norway. The population genetic structure of spawning grayling was studied using microsatellite genotyping, whileG. thymalliwas studied by sequencing a mitochondrial DNA gene (dehydrogenase subunit 5). Two main genetic clusters were revealed in grayling, one cluster comprising grayling from the largest spawning population, while the remaining tributaries formed the second cluster. For both taxa, some genetic differentiation was observed among tributaries, but there was no clear isolation-by-distance signature. The structuring was stronger for the host than for the parasite. These results imply that moderate to high levels of gene flow occur among the sub-populations of both taxa. The high parasite exchange among tributaries could result from a lack of strong homing behavior in grayling as well as interactions among individual fish outside of the spawning season, leading to frequent mixing of both host and parasite.					; Junge, Claudia/H-3534-2013; Mo, Tor/A-4025-2011; Vøllestad, Leif/H-7305-2019	Junge, Claudia/0000-0001-7709-3856; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2021	848	3					547	561		10.1007/s10750-020-04431-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04431-7		OCT 2020											WOS:000577935000002

More than 60 ciliate species were identified alive and after quantitative protargol staining (QPS). The ciliate diversity was high, and is described in detail for 50 taxa in time-depth intervals. Rimostrombidium brachykinetum/Rimostrombidium hyalinum and Balanion planctonicum were the most frequent species, accounting for 44% of the annual mean abundance and 15% of the annual mean biovolume, respectively. Our results suggested a stronger variability in the ciliate assemblage structure within seasons than along the depth gradient. Gradual changes in the assemblage structure with depths: (1) were accompanied by a decrease of algivorous and mixotrophic and an increase of bacterivorous ciliates from surface to deeper layers; (2) were highly significantly altered with steep depth gradients of their potential food resources, i.e. the biomass of heterotrophic flagellates, bacteria and algae; and (3) were related with lower significance to environmental parameters. High similarity (> 80 %) between successive months was reached only when net changes in the total ciliate abundance were negligible, while a strong increase or decrease in the ciliate abundance was associated with pronounced changes in the species composition. These seasonal changes in the ciliate assemblage structure (4) were linked to shifts of algivorous and mixotrophic, but not of bacterivorous ciliates and (5) were less predictable with food resources compared to the depth gradient. The phagotrophic flagellates generally followed the seasonal and vertical patterns described for ciliates, and were shown to be important members of the planktonic food web in a cold, deep, oligotrophic lake.					; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021	Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043; Sonntag, Bettina/0000-0001-7065-522X; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761													0948-3055	1616-1564				JUN 27	2006	43	2					193	207		10.3354/ame043193	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame043193													WOS:000239187100008

Four years of continuous monitoring of the Meirama end-pit lake and its impact in the definition of future uses	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Following the technical closure of the brown lignite Meirama mine (NW Spain) in April 2008, the reclamation of the mined area is being accomplished with the controlled flooding of its large pit. During the first 7 months of flooding, the sequential arrest of the ground water dewatering system led to the growth of an acidic water body of about 2 hm(3). Since October 2008, the surface waters from some local streams have been diverted towards the pit so that these have become the major water input in the flooding process. Surface water has promoted a major change in the chemical composition of the lake water so that, at present, its surface has a circum neutral pH, net alkalinity, and low conductivity. At present, the lake has slightly more than one half of its final volume, and it is expected the overflow in 3 to 3.5 years. The lake is meromictic, with a sharp chemocline separating the acidic monimolimnion (pH a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 3.2, acidity a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 150 mg CaCO3/L, kappa (25) a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 2.4 mS/cm) from the main water body (pH a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 6.5, alkalinity a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 15 mg CaCO3/L, kappa (25) a parts per thousand aEuro parts per thousand 0.3 mS/cm). Oxygen is being depleted at the bottom of the lake so that the monimolimnion became anoxic in January 2011. Above the chemocline, the composition of the lake is similar, but not identical, to that of the flooding stream waters. Close to the surface, some constituents (pH, metals) show strong seasonal variations in coincidence with the phytoplankton growing periods. Those parameters whose limits are legally prescribed comply with the corresponding water quality standards, and they are also consistent with the forecasting results obtained in early modeling. At present, a project considering the construction of an uptake tunnel to exploit the lake is being developed for the emergency water supply of the metropolitan area of A Corua.

Inverse mercury and selenium concentration patterns between herbivorous and piscivorous fish in the Tapajos River, Brazilian Amazon	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												We evaluated the levels of selenium and mercury in five fish species commonly eaten by local populations of the Brazilian Amazon. Fish specimens were sampled in two lotic and three lentic areas at two different phases of the hydrological cycle. Analyses of Carbon and Nitrogen stable isotopes allowed us to confirm the trophic levels of the fish species (one herbivorous, two omnivorous and two piscivorous) and verify that these levels remained unchanged with the habitats and the season. The levels of selenium and mercury in fish varied from 50 ng/g to 1006 ng/g and from 17 ng/g to 3502 ng/g respectively. For both seasons, fish from lotic ecosystems presented higher selenium concentrations. An inverse pattern was observed between selenium and mercury concentrations within the trophic chain, and this in both seasons. Indeed, the highest mean concentrations of selenium and lowest mean concentrations of mercury were measured in the herbivorous species and the opposite in the piscivorous species. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that local riverside populations will maximize the selenium health benefits of eating fish while minimizing their risk of being chronically exposed to mercury by preferentially consuming herbivorous species and to some extent omnivorous species, while avoiding piscivorous species.

Application of MODIS Imagery for Intra-Annual Water Clarity Assessment of Minnesota Lakes	REMOTE SENSING												Monitoring of water clarity trends is necessary for water resource managers. Remote sensing based methods are well suited for monitoring clarity in water bodies such as the inland lakes in Minnesota, United States. This study evaluated the potential of using imagery from NASA's MODIS sensor to study intra-annual variations in lake clarity. MODIS reflectance images from six dates throughout the 2006 growing season were used with field collected Secchi disk transparency data to estimate water clarity in large lakes throughout Minnesota. The results of this research indicate the following: water clarity estimates derived from MODIS imagery are largely similar to those derived from lower temporal resolution sensors such as Landsat, robust water clarity estimates can be derived using MODIS for many dates throughout a growing season (R-2 values between 0.32 and 0.71), and the relatively low spatial resolution of MODIS restricts its applicability to a subset of the largest inland lakes (> 160 ha, or 400 acres). This study suggests that water clarity maps developed with MODIS imagery and bathymetry data may be useful tools for resource managers concerned with intra- and inter-annual variations in large inland lakes.

J	Fernández, N; Aguilar, J; Piña-García, CA; Gershenson, C				Fernandez, Nelson; Aguilar, Jose; Pina-Garcia, C. A.; Gershenson, Carlos			Complexity of lakes in a latitudinal gradient	ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY												Measuring complexity is fast becoming a key instrument to compare different ecosystems at various scales in ecology. To date there has been little agreement on how to properly describe complexity in terms of ecology. In this regard, this manuscript assesses the significance of using a set of proposed measures based on information theory. These measures are as follows: emergence, self -organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used in the data analysis with the aim to apply these proposed measures. This study systematically reviews the data previously collected and generated by a model carried out on four aquatic ecosystems located between the Arctic region and the tropical zone. Thus, this research discusses the case of exploring a high level of self-organization in terms of movement, distribution, and quality of water between the northern temperate zone and the tropics. Moreover, it was assessed the significance of the presence of a complex variable (pH) in the middle of the latitudinal transect. Similarly, this study explores the relationship between self-organization and limiting nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and silicates). Furthermore, the importance of how a biomass subsystem is affected by seasonal variations is highlighted in this manuscript. This case study seeks to examine the changing nature of how seasonality affects the complexity dynamics of photosynthetic taxa (lakes located in northern temperate zone) at high latitudes, and it also investigates how a high level of self-organization at the tropical zone can lead to increase the amount of planktonic and benthic fish which determines the dynamics of complexity. This research also compares the emerging role of how a biomass subsystem has a highest temporal dynamics compared to he limiting nutrients' subsystem. In the same way, the results associated to autopoiesis reflect a moderate degree of autonomy of photosynthetic biomass. It is also discussed the case of how complexity values change in the middle of the latitudinal gradient for all components. Finally, a comparison with Tsallis information was carried out in order to determine that these proposed measures are more suitable due to they are independent of any other parameter. Thus, this approach considers some elements closely related to information theory which determine and better describe ecological dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four types of ET products are tested against rainfall in two large semi-arid to arid Australian basins from 2003 to 2010: two energy balance ET methods which are forced by optical satellite retrievals from MODIS; a newly developed land surface model (AWRA); and one approach based on observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and rainfall data. The two basins are quasi (Murray-Darling Basin: 1.06 million km(2)) and completely (Lake Eyre Basin: 1.14 million km(2)) endorheic. During the study period, two extreme climatic events-the Millennium drought and the strongest La Nina event-were recorded in the basins and are used in our assessment. The two remotely-sensed ET products constrained by the energy balance tended to overestimate ET flux over water-stressed regions. They had low sensitivity to climatic extremes and poor capability to close the water balance. However, these two remotely-sensed and energy balance products demonstrated their superiority in capturing spatial features including over small-scale and complicated landscapes. AWRA and GRACE formulated in the water balance framework were more sensitive to rainfall variability and yielded more realistic ET estimates during climate extremes. GRACE demonstrated its ability to account for seasonal and inter-annual change in water storage for ET evaluation.

J	Fonseca, R; Pinho, C; Oliveira, M				Fonseca, Rita; Pinho, Catarina; Oliveira, Manuela			The influence of particles recycling on the geochemistry of sediments in a large tropical dam lake in the Amazonian region, Brazil	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												As a result of over-erosion of soils, the fine particles, which contain the majority of nutrients, are easily washed away from soils, which become deficient in a host of components, accumulating in lakes. On one hand, the accumulation of nutrients-rich sediments are a problem, as they affect the quality of the overlying water and decrease the water storage capacity of the system; on the other hand, sediments may constitute an important resource, as they are often extremely rich in organic and inorganic nutrients in readily available forms. In the framework of an extensive work on the use of rock related materials to enhance the fertility of impoverish soils, this study aimed to evaluate the role on the nutrients cycle, of particles recycling processes from the watershed to the bottom of a large dam reservoir, at a wet tropical region under high weathering conditions. The study focus on the mineralogical transformations that clay particles undergo from the soils of the drainage basin to their final deposition within the reservoir and their influence in terms of the geochemical characteristics of sediments. We studied the bottom sediments that accumulate in two distinct seasonal periods in Tucurul reservoir, located in the Amazonian Basin, Brazil, and soils from its drainage basin. The surface layers of sediments in twenty sampling points with variable depths, are representative of the different morphological sections of the reservoir. Nineteen soil samples, representing the main soil classes, were collected near the margins of the reservoir. Sediments and soils were subjected to the same array of physical, mineralogical and geochemical analyses: (1) texture, (2) characterization and semi-quantification of the clay fraction mineralogy and (3) geochemical analysis of the total concentration of major elements, organic compounds (organic C and nitrogen), soluble fractions of nutrients (P and K), exchangeable fractions (cation exchange capacity, exchangeable bases and acidity) and pH(H2O). There is a remarkable homogeneity in the sedimentary distribution along the reservoir in terms of the texture and mineralogy of the clay fraction and of the chemistry of the total, soluble and exchangeable phases. These observations contrast with the physical, morphological and chemical heterogeneity of the soils and the setting lithology. Most of the sediments has a higher contribution of fine-grained material and the mineralogy of the clay fraction is dominated by kaolinite in soils and kaolinite and illite in sediments, followed by lesser amounts of gibbsite, goethite, and metahaloisite and by small/vestigial contents of chlorite and smectite. The sediments are mainly inherited from the watershed but there exist marked differences between the accumulated sediments and their parent materials. These differences mainly come from the selective erosion of fine-grained particles and the extreme climatic conditions which enhance complex transformations of mineralogical and chemical nature. Compared with the parental soils, the reservoir sediments show the following differences: (1) enrichment in fine-grained and less dense inorganic particles, (2) aggradative mineralogical transformations, including enrichment in clay minerals with higher cationic adsorption and exchange capacity, (3) degradation of the crystalline structure of Fe- and Al-oxides (goethite, gibbsite), (4) increase in easily leached elements (Mg, Ca, P, K, Na) and decrease in chemically less mobile elements (Si, Fe) and (5) higher contents of organic carbon, nitrogen, and soluble forms of P and K, mainly concentrated in the clay fraction. These transformations are extremely important in the nutrients cycle, denoting that sediments represent an efficient sink for nutrients from the over-erosion of soils. Mineral and organic compounds can permanently or temporarily sequester these nutrients, recycling them and enhancing their availability through the slow release of components from relatively loose crystal structures. These processes can easily explain the enrichment in soluble and exchangeable forms of elements such as P, K, Ca or Mg. This study conclude that the particles recycling in a large tropical dam reservoir which receives high fluxes of allochthonous nutrients, has an important role in the good quality of sediments for agricultural use and in the profitable use of this technology to recover depleted soils in remediation projects in regions near large hydroelectric plants.

J	Huang, L; Xu, XL; Zhai, J; Sun, CY				Huang, Lin; Xu, Xinliang; Zhai, Jun; Sun, Chaoyang			Local background climate determining the dynamics of plateau lakes in China	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Lakes under natural conditions are potential indicators of climate change, but limited evidence has been proposed to explicitly explain the mechanisms of large-scale lake changes associated with climate. In this paper, satellite imageries from the 1970s to 2010 were compared to track the dynamic change patterns of plateau lakes. It aims to identify the forcing of climate change on the lakes in plateau regions of China. Results revealed that: (1) widespread expanding trends in the area and abundance of lakes on wetter plateau regions, by increasing precipitation and snow presented a positive effect on lake levels, as well as warming resulted glacier melting and permafrost degrading contributed to expansion of lakes in the regions covered by glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau by 58-62 % and of 13-20 % on the western Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Plateau; (2) shrinkage lakes in the main portion of the arid regions were mainly caused by the decreasing wind speed resulted water balance change, irrigation and other human utilization of water resources. Although precipitation decreased, wind speed also has the most dominant impact on decreasing evaporation, followed by solar radiation, both of which offset the effect of increasing temperature, especially in eastern Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Plateau; (3) thawing permafrost led to shrinkage of lakes in an area of seasonal permafrost, the shrinking and splitting of lakes in a discontinuous permafrost zone, and the rising of lake levels in an area of continuous permafrost; (4) the future of the plateau lakes under climate change must be in question, because the glacier and snow melting water is not sustainable for wetter regions, and the increasing water consumption caused by the farmland expansion for arid regions.					; Huang, Lin/JNS-7316-2023	Zhai, Jun/0000-0001-5272-1158; 													1436-3798	1436-378X				DEC	2016	16	8			SI		2457	2470		10.1007/s10113-016-0963-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-016-0963-x													WOS:000388959100025

The influence of external perturbations on the functional composition of phytoplankton in a Mediterranean reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The changes in abundance and composition experienced by phytoplankton communities in lakes and reservoirs occur in response to variations in the physical (light climate or energy) and the chemical (nutrient availability or resources) constraints for algal growth. Mediterranean reservoirs are very dynamic systems, subject to frequent changes in the physical environment as a result of water management operations, which suggests that phytoplankton communities might also undergo frequent changes. The phytoplankton community composition, abundance and seasonal dynamics of El Gergal, a medium-size Mediterranean reservoir, is analyzed and interpreted in terms of changes in the nutrient-energy balance. It is demonstrated that the seasonal scale changes in the physical environment trigger the seasonal predictable autogenic dynamics of the phytoplankton community. In addition, frequent short-term external perturbations of the physical environment may also induce allogenic shifts and reversions in the succession. The physical changes occur mainly as a result of variations in the outflows. Results are discussed in terms of phytoplankton functional groups life cycle strategies and water quality management.

J	Shao, TT; Wang, T; Liang, XW; Li, LY				Shao, Tiantian; Wang, Tao; Liang, Xiaowen; Li, Liuyang			Seasonal dynamics of light absorption by suspended particulate matter and CDOM in highly turbid inland rivers on the Loess Plateau, China	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The spectral characteristics of optically active constituents in water are key parameters in bio-optical modelling. Light absorption by phytoplankton [a(ph)(lambda)], nonalgal particles (NAPs) [a(NAP)(lambda)], and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) [a(CDOM)(lambda)] was investigated at 28 sites in the Wuding River (WDR) during the abundant river flow period (AP) in July 2017 and the normal river flow period (NP) in May 2018. The water quality parameters in the WDR substantially differed between the AP and NP. The dissolved organic carbon and turbidity were high in the NP, and chlorophyll a (Chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), dissolved oxygen concentrations and electrical conductivity were low in the AP. a(p)(675) and Chl-a were more strongly correlated in the NP (r=0.96) than in the AP (r=0.41). a(NAP)(440) and a(NAP)(675) were strongly correlated with TSM (r=0.98 and 0.97) in the AP but weakly correlated in the NP. Moreover, a(ph)(lambda) was positively correlated with Chl-a in both the AP and NP. In addition, a(CDOM)(440) was significantly correlated with Chl-a (r=0.62, p<.001) in the NP but not the AP. TSM was weakly correlated with a(CDOM)(440) in both the AP and NP. The S275-295 values in the NP (0.0147-0.020 nm(-1)) were lower than those in the AP, demonstrating that the molecular weights were higher in the AP than in the NP. The photosynthetically active radiation absorption of most samples was dominated by the NAPs and CDOM, implying a crucial role in light attenuation in highly turbid inland rivers on the Loess Plateau.

Juvenile Recruitment of Oak Toads (Anaxyrus quercicus) Varies with Time-Since-Fire in Seasonal Ponds	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												The direct and indirect effects of fire on different life stages of amphibians are poorly understood and difficult to predict given interspecific variation in physiology and life history. We investigated how time-since-fire (TSF) of seasonal ponds embedded within Florida scrub habitat affected growth, development, and survival of larval Oak Toads (Anaxyrus quercicus). We selected 12 ponds at Archbold Biological Station on the southern Lake Wales Ridge, Florida: four burned within the last 4 mo, four burned 3-4 yr ago, and four burned 11 yr ago. We hatched and reared three clutches of Oak Toads in the laboratory for 2 wk and then sorted larvae into groups of 24 having equal representation from each clutch. We randomly assigned groups of larvae to 0.22-m(3) mesh field enclosures in each pond (n = 2-3 enclosures per pond) and measured environmental variables that might contribute to observed amphibian responses including pH, temperature, and periphyton growth. After 15 d, when larvae began metamorphosing, mean survival was significantly higher in the most-recently burned ponds. The TSF did not have a significant effect on developmental stage or tadpole size, although Oak Toad larvae tended to develop faster in the most-recently burned ponds. Although all ponds were acidic (pH < 4.3), there was a trend toward higher pH in the more-recently burned ponds, and survival was significantly positively correlated with pH. Overall our results suggest that performance and recruitment of larval Oak Toads are higher in recently burned ponds.

However, there is a lack of numerical models for predicting oil spill transport in freshwater, especially under icy conditions. To tackle this challenge, we developed a prediction system for oil with ice modeling by coupling the General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment (GNOME) model with the Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS) model. Taking Lake Erie as a pilot study, we used observed drifter data to evaluate the performance of the coupled model. Additionally, we developed six hypothetical oil spill cases in Lake Erie, considering both with and without ice conditions during the freezing, stable, and melting seasons spanning from 2018 to 2022, to investigate the impacts of ice cover on oil spill processes. The results showed the effective performance of the coupled model system in capturing the movements of a deployed drifter. Through ensemble simulations, it was observed that the stable season with high -concentration ice had the most significant impact on limiting oil transport compared to the freezing and melting seasons, resulting in an oilaffected open water area of 49 km 2 on day 5 with ice cover, while without ice cover it reached 183 km 2 . The stable season with high -concentration ice showed a notable reduction in the probability of oil presence in the risk map, whereas this reduction effect was less prominent during the freezing and melting seasons. Moreover, negative correlations between initial ice concentration and oil -affected open water area were consistent, especially on day 1 with a linear regression R -squared value of 0.94, potentially enabling rapid prediction. Overall, the coupled model system serves as a useful tool for simulating oil spills in the world ' s largest freshwater system, particularly under icy conditions, thus enhancing the formulation of effective emergency response strategies.					; Song, Yang/GQB-2088-2022; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	Kessler, James/0000-0001-8643-7569; Song, Yang/0000-0002-7120-4583; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY	2024	358								120810	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120810	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120810		APR 2024						38593738					WOS:001224894200001

Opportunistic fungi in lake water and fungal infections in associated human population in Dal Lake, Kashmir	MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS												Natural habitats of opportunistic fungal pathogens are outside of the host; therefore, it is critically important to understand their ecology and routes of transmission. In this study, we investigated the presence of human pathogenic opportunistic fungi in lake water and incidence of fungal infections in associated population in Kashmir, India. Six hundred forty water samples were taken on seasonal basis from a wide network of sampling stations of the lake for an extended period of two years for screening their occurrence. The samples were inoculated onto rose bengal agar, malt extract agar, potato dextrose agar and other specified culture media supplemented with Chloramphenicol and Streptomycin followed by incubation at 37 degrees C. All the samples were positive for fungi, which were later identified by sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region aided by classical morphological culture techniques and physiological profiling. The whole process led to the isolation of sixteen species of opportunistic fungal pathogens belonging to genus Aspergillus, Candida, Penicillium, Cryptococcus, Fusarium, Rhizopus and Mucor in decreasing order of prevalence. Furthermore, 20% population (n = 384) of Dal inhabitants was examined for possible fungal infections and it was observed that only 8.07% individuals were positive for fungal infections with 4.68% skin infection cases, 2.34% onychomycosis cases and 1.04% candidiasis cases. Scrapings from onychomycosis and candidiasis patients showed the presence of Aversicolor and Calbicans respectively, resembling exactly the strains isolated from the lake water. However, the skin infection was because of a dermatophyte not isolated for the lake water. Higher prevalence of infection (6.77%) was seen in people using lake water followed by a positive prevalence of 1.30% using tap water. The results of present study suggest that the lake inhabitants are at a greater risk of getting life threatening fungal diseases which may lead to various morbidities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

HIGH INCIDENCE OF ROAD-KILLED FRESHWATER TURTLES AT A LAKE IN EAST TEXAS, USA	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												We describe a high incidence of road-killed freshwater turtles along a section of US 190 in eastern Texas, USA. The surveyed section spans B.A. Steinhagen Lake by means of a series of bridges and a causeway. We detected 850 road-killed turtles between 2008 and 2012 of which 40% were positively identified as female, 1% male, and the remaining 59% were too damaged to confirm the sex. We found more dead turtles during the breeding season (May to August) than other times of year. The causeway is attractive to female turtles as a nesting site, and the use of the road side causes an increased risk of road mortality. To our knowledge, this site has the highest documented rate of unmitigated turtle road mortality in North America.																			2151-0733	1931-7603				APR	2016	11	1					181	187																WOS:000375251800020

Carbon limitation of sediment bacterial production and denitrification in high nitrate low carbon systems	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The concentrations and ratios of carbon and nitrogen may affect bacterial denitrification through changes in enzyme or bacterial production, but short-term laboratory and field assays may not account for changes over longer periods. Drainage from agricultural landscapes can have different ratios of C:N depending on the water source, i.e., surface runoff has elevated C: N relative to agriculture tile drainage water. We hypothesized that differences in C: N ratios limit bacterial production and reduce denitrification rates. Sediment cores collected from surface or tile water fed wetlands were incubated in low C: N (1: 1) and high C: N (4: 1) ratios keeping nitrogen concentrations at 10 mg L-1 NO3-N. We used replicated laboratory incubations that were destructively sampled on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 to represent pulsed water inputs to wetlands to test for potential increases in denitrification over time with elevated C: N (4: 1) ratios. Bacterial production and denitrification were estimated using [H-3] leucine incorporation and the acetylene block method. Bacterial production and denitrification increased (p < 0.0001) in response to elevated C: N (4: 1). Carbon was likely preferentially allocated for bacterial production at low C: N as explained by the lack of change in denitrification at the 1: 1 C: N ratio, but facilitated a significant increase in bacterial production throughout the 20 day incubation. The results suggest that if labile carbon were to be increased in subsurface tile drainage, prolonged seasonal water inputs would likely increase nitrate removal as shown by the increased denitrification throughout the 20 day study period. New agricultural conservation practices such as the implementation of cover crops have the indirect benefit of restoring soil organic matter and may improve allochthonous inputs of labile carbon.

Field surveys were carried out in August 2016 (flood period), December 2016 (post-flood period), and May 2017 (pre-flood period). Fifteen sampling sites representing five sectors were selected to cover the lake whole area. The results revealed a highly significant difference (p <= 0.016) in the density of all identified zooplankton groups among different flood seasons and lake locations. The zooplankton standing crop during the flood was higher, by a factor of approximately 3.7, than that recorded in post-flood and pre-flood periods. Zooplankton was dominated by medium-sized Copepoda, two cyclopoids (Thermocyclops neglectusandMesocyclops ogunnus) and one calanoid (Thermodiaptomus galebi). The euplanktonic rotiferKeratella cochlearisdominated, during post-flood and pre-flood periods, constituting approximately 83% and 77% of total rotifer densities, respectively.Keratella tropicaoccurred in greatest density during flood made up 52.6% of total rotifers.Diaphanosoma mongolianumwas the main cladoceran during flood and post-flood periods, whereasCeriodaphnia dubiadensities were highest for pre-flood periods.

Currently, 90% of available water resources are already mobilized and climate change exacerbates the country's aridity which makes it difficult to monitor water needs. With a view to contributing to their effective management and setting future directions for controlling and improving inland fish productivity, a comparative limnological study was carried out on 8 artificial reservoirs that were stocked with mullet fry. This study, based on a review of existing data, provides information on the availability and quality of inland water resources in relation to international standards and the biological potential (plankton, fish and other organisms) of these reservoirs. The satisfactory water quality for aquatic life, as well as the significant growth and production of introduced species associated with the rearing of mullet fry, clearly show that, despite several problems, Tunisian reservoirs represent an important potential that still needs to be developed. To this end, we recommend to improve the fishing techniques and the stocking of mullet fry. In addition, the strengthening of fishermen's groups, the encouragement of private initiative and the quality control of water and fish meat are highly requested.

Evaluation and assessment of water quality in Likangala River and its catchment area	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					11th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWP-SA Annual Symposium	OCT 27-29, 2010	Victoria Falls, ZIMBABWE	WATERnet, WARFSA, Global Water				Likangala is one of the perennial rivers in Malawi that flow into a closed Lake Chilwa, a designated wetland ratified by Ramsar Convention in 1997. Earlier work conducted on this river revealed considerable social-economic activities at riverbanks resulting in indiscriminate disposal of wastes. This study intended to evaluate water quality in Likangala River and its catchment area. Water samples were collected thrice (dry, early rainy and mid rainy seasons) and tested for major physico-chemical and microbiological parameters. The EC, pH, and selected ions (NO3-, PO43-, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) were analysed in soil samples obtained in crop fields along the river banks. Elevated EC levels (>1035.00 mu S/cm) were measured during mid rainy season at site S15 (Zomba Sewage Works), near and in the lake. Most of the water samples (86%, n = 28) registered phosphate levels above 1.50 mg/L during mid rainy season with a maximum value (10.70 +/- 0.01 mg/L) at site S15. Lower amounts (<0.05 mg/L) of Pb2+, Cd2+, Cr3+, Zn2+ and Mn2+ were measured at few sites, while Cu2+ and Ni2+ were all below detection limits. The water was classified as soft (0-75 mg/L CaCO3) to moderately hard (75-150 mg/L CaCO3). The total and fecal coliform counts above the World Health Organisation (2008) and Malawi Bureau of Standards (2005) limits (0 cfu/100 ml) at some sites signified that the water is unsuitable for human consumption without treatment. The study showed that the river is fairly polluted, the effects being significant in the urban area, near and in the lake. This calls for awareness campaigns aiming at behavioural change and integrated control of water, land use and waste management in order to prevent escalation of the effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Golden perch Macquaria ambigua are flexible spawners in the Darling River, Australia	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The role of flow and floodplains for the recruitment of fishes in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, remains a contentious issue. In this context, the reproductive ecology of golden perch Macquaria ambigua, a widespread, high-profile angling species with a propensity to produce large numbers of semi-pelagic eggs remains to be resolved. Back-calculation of spawning dates from otoliths of juvenile golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) collected in August and November 1997 from the Menindee Lakes on the floodplain of the Darling River, in western New South Wales, Australia, advances understanding of spawning of this species in three ways: (1) golden perch spawned at lower temperatures (<= 18.8 degrees C) than has previously been reported from the Murray-Darling Basin; (2) golden perch in the Menindee Lakes can be derived from spawning in all seasons of the year in contrast to what is apparent in more southerly locations of the Murray-Darling Basin; and (3) spawning can occur in the absence of floods.

Here, first, we show that a modified spectrogram analysis (MSA) is more efficient than simple Fourier transform to reveal weak periodic signals. Secondly, we show how transient periodic signals can be monitored as a function of time using spectrograms. These methods are applied to time-series of radon and carbon dioxide concentration, dripwater flow rates and air temperature measured during several years in the Roselend dead-end tunnel, located in the French Alps near an artificial lake. A weak S-2 line is evidenced in radon concentration, with enhanced amplitude during transient radon bursts. Similarly, the S-2 line is observed using MSA in dripwater flow rates which sample mainly fracture flow, as suggested by a hydrochemical analysis, while it is not seen in dripwater flow rates sampling matrix flow. In the absence of a strong 24 hr line, the presence of a S-2 line suggests sensitivity to barometric pressure, and thus a significant advective contribution in radon and some dripwater transport. No S-2 line is observed in the carbon dioxide time-series. The temporal structure of the S-2 component, however, is not similar in the radon concentration and the dripwater flow rates, suggesting, in particular, that dripwater does not play a significant role in the generation of radon bursts. Temperature time-series exhibit a significant S-2 contribution, induced by atmospheric pressure, spatially organised in the tunnel, decreasing vertically upwards. A remarkable transient temperature inversion during radon bursts suggests that the additional advective air contributions responsible for the radon bursts occur from the non-saturated rocks below the tunnel.

In two temperate reservoirs, species composition, diversity index, and species dynamics were characterized over periods of 3 weeks during different seasons, in parallel with changes in the physical and chemical structure of the water column. Dominant species and diversity index were shown to be controlled by environmental factors fluctuating on a seasonal and weekly time scale, whereas some rarer species responded to wind events and were indicators of a very short-term environmental change. As a consequence of the response of indicator species, the rate of change in species composition increased following meteorological events. Shifts in species composition were observed during each sampling period, except during the strongest stratification period. The shifts were associated with a modification of resource availability or intensity of stratification. We found that the resistance of the phytoplankton community to short-term physical forcing by wind increased with intensity of stratification. After the forcing event, the community did not return to its original structure because of modifications of the physical and chemical conditions induced by meteorological forcing on a weekly time scale.

Midsummer areal coverage at shallow depths (:5 5 m) ranged from 4-100%, with a median value of 96%. Cladophora biomass began accumulating at most sites during early May, and achieved maximum values by mid-July. Peak seasonal biomass ranged from < 1 to 940 g/m(2) dry mass (DM), with a median value of 171 g/m(2) DM. Nearshore water concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) were lower than during pre-phosphorus abatement years. However, Cladophora biomass levels were similar to reported values in those years. The midsummer "die off" occurred shortly after the biomass peak, when water temperatures neared 22.5 degrees C. Areal coverage declined after die-off to < 10%, mean filament lengths declined from 33 cm to < 1 cm, and mean biomass declined to < 1 g DM/m(2). Tissue phosphorus varied seasonally, with initial high values in early May (0.15 to 0.27% DM; median 0.23% DM) to midsummer seasonal low values during peak biomass (0.03 to 0.23% DM; median 0.06% DM). Cladophora biomass is sensitive to changes in phosphorus and light availability, and reductions in biomass previously achieved through phosphorus control may now be reversed because of increased water transparency and phosphorus availability to the benthos following establishment of dreissenids.

The level of dissolved P was recorded between 0.03 and 0.9 mg/l and the level of N-NO3 ranged from 0.05 to 1.01 mg/l indicating that the limits were above USEPA aquatic criteria. The HMs varied from 0.08 to 2.85 mg/l for Cu, 0.10 to 1.60 mg/l for Fe, 0.04 to 0.22 mg/l for Cr, and Mn was below detection. Cr and Fe were above the aquatic and drinking water guideline limit. Spatially, pollution was more significant in areas receiving drainage. Also, except Cu and Fe, other parameters were higher in the rainy season indicating storm runoff pollution. The overall pollution indices of water quality status, such as water quality index 63, heavy metal pollution index 3.1, and nutrient pollution index 4.7, indicated the quality level of water to be alarming. Therefore, comprehensive regulatory and waste management practices are needed.																				1751-231X				APR	2024	19	4					1200	1218		10.2166/wpt.2024.083	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wpt.2024.083		APR 2024											WOS:001196754500001

Four stages of thermokarst, "Bullar,""Dyede,""Tuumpu" and mature "Alas," differing in age, depth of depression and water presence, were selected for examination. The emission of CH4 was measured at each thermokarst in forest, dry grassland, wet grassland and on the pond surface. The forest plots were CH4 sinks and uptake ranged from -1 to -34 mu g C m(-2) h(-1). The CH4 fluxes from dry grasslands ranged from -5.4 to 0.9 mu g C m(-2) h(-1), and in wet grasslands CH4 fluxes substantially increased, ranging from 3.6 to 285 mu g C m(-2) h(-1). Pond surfaces had the highest CH4 emissions, ranging from 657 to 8.0 x 10(3) mu g C m(-2) h(-1). The amount of CH4 stored in the permafrost (up to a depth of 15 m) was estimated to be approximately 0.259 g C m(-2). This value was small compared with the current CH4 emission from pond surfaces (4.3-16 g C m(-2) growing season(-1)) in thermokarst depressions. Accordingly, the release of CH4 trapped in the permafrost was not significant compared with the high CH4 emission from the pond surface in young thermokarst depressions. The formation of thermokarst involving permafrost thawing could influence the regional CH4 budget significantly by forming thermokarst wetlands that produce and emit CH4 as a result of current microbial processes under anaerobic conditions.

We studied an extensive tephra-paleosol sequence near the city of Tlaxcala (11 paleosols grouped in 3 units: Grey, Brown and Red) in two sections (Tlalpan and Mamut) to obtain a paleoclimate proxy for the middle to late Pleistocene and the Holocene. A general paleoclimatic trend for the last 900, 000 yr is interpreted from the Tlalpan section (the base dated by K/Ar), and a more detailed record for the period starting with Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) from the Mamut section (provided with a set of C-14 dales). Morphological, physicochemical and mineralogical characteristics of all buried paleosols point to pedogenic processes typical for humid ecosystems, namely: weathering and neoformation of kaolinitic-halloysitic clay, gleization, and clay illuviation, whereas the surface late Holocene soil is characterized by precipitation of carbonates, indicative of a drier climate. In Tlalpan section, the lowest Red Unit demonstrates the strongest development of weathering features, together with maximum accumulation of clay and crystallized iron oxides. The overlying paleosols have lower weathering status; the intermediate Brown Unit shows prominent features of clay illuviation whereas the upper Grey Unit is marked by surface redoximorphic properties. We hypothesize that the Red Unit paleosols correspond to the period of the Mid Pleistocene Climate Transition, when less pronounced glacial/interglacial climate cyclicity permitted more advanced soil development through long periods of landscape stability. In the Mamut section vertic features are present in the lower paleosol, weathering and clay illuviation are more pronounced in the middle one, and the incipient upper soil is dominated by gleization features. This trend indicates the change from drier climate with strong seasonality in the second half of MIS3 to uniform cool humid conditions during major part of MIS2 and then to unstable climate with uneven, occasionally excessive precipitation in the late Glacial, which promoted local synsedimentary soil formation in a wetland environment.

Accumulation and distribution of radionuclides in higher aquatic plants during the vegetation period	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												The long-term observations of the dynamics of Sr-90 and Cs-137 concentration, as well as the physicochemical forms of these radionuclides in 10 species of higher aquatic plants during the vegetation period of Glyboke Lake in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone were presented. The accumulation of radionuclides depends on the influence of environmental factors and species characteristics of the studied plants. It has been shown that the accumulation of Sr-90 and Cs-137 by plants mainly occurs in accordance with the physiological stages of their development. Under conditions of intensive growth and accumulation of biomass in the juvenile period, plants disproportionately uptake Cs-137 from the environment; during the seed ripening period at the stage of aging, plants mainly accumulate Sr-90, as evidenced by the non-correlation of this radionuclide concentration in water and plants in the considered periods. The specific features of the accumulation of radionuclides by plants were studied by the method of analysis of physicochemical forms, which consists in the sequential extraction of radionuclides from plant preparations and makes it possible to quantitatively investigate potentially exchange and fixed forms. The analysis of physicochemical forms confirmed the patterns of seasonal distribution of radionuclides, as well as their accumulation in cells, tissues and in the whole plant obtained from long-term observations.																			0265-931X	1879-1700				OCT	2020	222								106361	10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106361								32791374					WOS:000568995500004

Geomorphological Response of Alluvial Streams to Flood Events during Base-Level Lowering: Insights from Drone-Based Photogrammetric Surveys in Dead Sea Tributaries	REMOTE SENSING												The geomorphological impact of base-level lowering on ephemeral alluvial streams has been extensively investigated through fieldwork, experimentation, and modeling. Yet, the understanding of hydrological parameters governing the dynamics of the stream's geometry during discrete flood events is lacking due to limited direct measurements of flood-scale erosion/deposition. The emergence of novel remote sensing methods allows for quantifying morphological modifications caused by floods in alluvial streams. This study utilizes drone surveys and hydrological data to quantitatively investigate the relation between channel evolution in alluvial tributaries draining to the receding Dead Sea and the hydrological characteristics of flash floods. Drone-based photogrammetric surveys were conducted before and after 25 floods, over a period of four years, to generate centimeter-scale Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and orthophoto maps of two major streams. The outcomes of these DEMs are maps of ground elevation changes (erosion/deposition), thalweg longitudinal profiles, and channel cross sections, revealing the incision/aggradation along and across the streams. Statistical comparison of results with flow hydrographs identified potential relations linking the hydrological characteristics of each flood and the corresponding geomorphological modifications. Peak discharge emerged as the primary factor influencing sediment removal, leading to more efficient sediment evacuation and a negative sediment budget with increased discharge. Water volumes of floods also exhibited a secondary effect on the sediment budget. The chronological order of floods, whether first or later in the season, was identified as the primary factor determining incision magnitude. Knickpoints formed at the streams' outlets during the dry period, when lake-level drops, amplifying the impact of the first flood. These findings have potential implications for infrastructure planning and environmental management in the context of climate change and altered water runoff. The research highlights the efficiency of drone-based photogrammetry for cost-effective and timely data collection, providing invaluable flexibility for field research.					; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021	, Nadav/0000-0002-4726-1668; 														2072-4292				APR	2024	16	8							1346	10.3390/rs16081346	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16081346													WOS:001210316700001

In this study, a methodology was developed for obtaining the 30 m annual maximum NDVI to overcome these shortcomings. First, the Landsat NDVI was simulated by fusing Landsat and MODIS NDVI by using the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), and then a single-peaked symmetric logistic model was employed to fit the Landsat NDVI data and derive the maximum NDVI in a year. The annual maximum NDVI was then used as a season-independent substitute to monitor grassland variation from 2001 to 2022 in a typical area covering the major vegetation types in the Qinghai Lake Basin. The major conclusions are as follows: (1) Our method for reconstructing the NDVI time series yielded higher accuracy than the existing dataset. The root mean square error (RMSE) for 91.8% of the pixels was less than 0.1. (2) The annual maximum NDVI from 2001 to 2022 exhibited spatial distribution characteristics, with higher values in the northern and southern regions and lower values in the central area. In addition, the earlier vegetation growth maximum dates were related to the vegetation type and accompanied by higher NDVI maxima in the study area. (3) The overall interannual variation showed a slight increasing trend from 2001 to 2022, and the degraded area was characterized as patches and was dominated by Alpine kobresia spp., Forb Meadow, whose change resulted from a combination of permafrost degradation, overgrazing, and rodent infestation and should be given more attention in the Qinghai Lake Basin.					li, Fang/LIC-6645-2024	Liang, Sihai/0000-0003-0037-438X														2072-4292				APR	2024	16	7							1222	10.3390/rs16071222	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16071222													WOS:001200990800001
J	Li, YR; Li, SQ; Cheng, L; Zhou, LH; Chang, LW; Liu, P				Li, Yuran; Li, Shiqiong; Cheng, Lei; Zhou, Lihao; Chang, Liwei; Liu, Pan			High Spatiotemporal Estimation of Reservoir Evaporation Water Loss by Integrating Remote-Sensing Data and the Generalized Complementary Relationship	REMOTE SENSING												Accurately estimating the reservoir evaporation loss is crucial for water resources management. The existing research on reservoir evaporation loss estimates primarily focuses on large spatiotemporal scales and neglects the rapid dynamic changes to reservoirs' surface area. For reservoirs essential for frequent flood control and regular water supply, high spatiotemporal evaporation data are crucial. By integrating remote sensing and the evaporation model, this study proposes a new method for the high spatiotemporal estimation of the evaporation losses from reservoirs. The proposed method is applied to the largest artificial freshwater lake in Asia, i.e., Danjiangkou (DJK) Reservoir. The daily reservoir water surface area is extracted at a spatial resolution of 30 m during the period 2014-2018 based on the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM). The daily evaporation rate is estimated at a spatial resolution of 100 m using the generalized complementary relationship (GCR). The results show that the water surface area of the DJK Reservoir exhibits rapid and frequent fluctuations from 2015 to 2018, with a multi-year average area of 731.9 km2 and a maximum and minimum difference of 304 km2. Significant seasonal variations are observed in both the evaporation rate and volume, with a multi-year average evaporation rate of 806 mm and evaporation volume of 595 million m3. The estimated results align well with three other independent estimates, indicating that the GCR is capable of water surface evaporation estimation. Further analysis suggests that the data resolution has a great influence on the evaporative water loss from the reservoir. The estimated mean annual evaporation volume based on the 1000 m resolution water surface area data is 14% lower than that estimated using the 30 m resolution water surface area data. This study not only provides a new method for the high spatiotemporal estimation of reservoir evaporation by integrating remote-sensing data and the GCR method but also highlights that reservoir evaporation water loss should be quantified using the volume rather than the rate and that the estimated loss is noticeably affected by the estimation spatial resolution.

Regions where human infrastructure and activity are rapidly densifying or newly appearing constitute novel environments in which wildlife must learn to coexist with people, thereby serving as ideal case studies with which to infer future human-wildlife interactions in shared landscapes. As a widely reviled and behaviorally plastic apex predator, the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) is a model species for understanding how large carnivores navigate these human-caused 'landscapes of fear' in a changing world. Using high-resolution GPS collar data, we applied resource selection functions and step selection functions to assess spotted hyena landscape navigation and fine-scale movement decisions in relation to social-ecological features in a rapidly developing region comprising two protected areas: Lake Nakuru National Park and Soysambu Conservancy, Kenya. We then used camera trap imagery and Barrier Behavior Analysis (BaBA) to further examine hyena interactions with barriers. Our results show that environmental factors, linear infrastructure, human-carnivore conflict hotspots, and human tolerance were all important predictors for landscape-scale resource selection by hyenas, while human experience elements were less important for fine-scale hyena movement decisions. Hyena selection for these characteristics also changed seasonally and across land management types. Camera traps documented an exceptionally high number of individual spotted hyenas (234) approaching the national park fence at 16 sites during the study period, and BaBA results suggested that hyenas perceive protected area boundaries' semi-permeable electric fences as risky but may cross them out of necessity. Our findings highlight that the ability of carnivores to flexibly respond within human-caused landscapes of fear may be expressed differently depending on context, scale, and climatic factors. These results also point to the need to incorporate societal factors into multiscale analyses of wildlife movement to effectively plan for human-wildlife coexistence. Mwingiliano kati ya binadamu na wanyamapori unaongezeka kwa ukali kutokana na mabadiliko ya hali ya hewa na ukuaji wa miji. Maeneo ambapo miundombinu ya binadamu na shughuli zinaongezeka kwa haraka au kutokea kwa mara ya kwanza yanajumuisha mazingira mapya ambayo wanyamapori lazima wajifunze kuishi pamoja na watu, hivyo kutoa masomo bora ya kifani ya jinsi ya kufikiria mwingiliano wa baadaye kati ya binadamu na wanyamapori katika mandhari ya pamoja. Kama mnyama ambaye watu wanaona vibaya na mwenye tabia inayoweza kubadilika, fisi madoa (Crocuta crocuta) ni spishi ya mfano katika kuelewa jinsi wanyama pori wanavyopitia 'mandhari ya hofu' zilizosababishwa na binadamu katika ulimwengu unaobadilika. Tumetumia data iliyokusanywa na vifaa vya GPS vilivyowekwa kwenye shingo ya fisi, tumetumia vigezo vya uteuzi wa rasilimali na vigezo vya uteuzi wa hatua kuchunguza njia za mandhari za fisi madoa na maamuzi ya harakati za kina kwa kuzingatia vipengele vya kijamii na mazingira katika eneo linaloendelea kwa kasi linalojumuisha maeneo mawili yaliyolindwa: Hifadhi ya Kitaifa ya Ziwa Nakuru na Soysambu Conservancy, Kenya. Kisha tumetumia picha za kamera na Uchambuzi wa Tabia ya Kizuizi (BaBA) kuchunguza zaidi mwingiliano wa fisi madoa na vizuizi. Matokeo yetu yanaonyesha kuwa sababu za mazingira, miundombinu ya linear, maeneo yenye mzozo kati ya binadamu na wanyama pori, na uvumilivu wa binadamu zote zilikuwa ni viashiria muhimu vya uteuzi wa rasilimali wa fisi madoa kwa kiwango cha mandhari, wakati viashiria vya uzoefu wa binadamu vilikuwa na umuhimu mdogo katika harakati za kina za fisi madoa. Uchaguzi wa fisi kwa vipengele hivi pia ulibadilika kulingana na msimu na aina za usimamizi wa ardhi. Kamera zilirekodi idadi kubwa sana ya fisi madoa (234) wanaokaribia uzio wa hifadhi ya kitaifa katika tovuti 16 wakati wa kipindi cha utafiti, na matokeo ya BaBA yalionyesha kuwa fisi wanachukulia uzio wa eneo lililolindwa kama hatari lakini wanaweza kuuvuka kwa lazima. Matokeo yetu yanasisitiza kuwa uwezo wa wanyama pori wa kujibu kwa mazingira ya hofu yaliyosababishwa na binadamu unaweza kujitokeza tofauti kulingana na muktadha, kiwango, na sababu za hali ya hewa. Matokeo haya pia yanasisitiza umuhimu wa kuingiza sababu za kijamii katika uchambuzi wa harakati za mnyama pori kwa kiwango mbalimbali ili kupanga kwa ufanisi kwa ushirikiano kati ya binadamu na wanyamapori. Regions where human infrastructure and activity are increasing rapidly or newly appearing constitute novel environments where wildlife must learn to navigate and coexist with people; yet, we do not fully understand how even the most behaviorally flexible species move through these social-ecological landscapes. We used high-resolution GPS collar data, camera trap imagery, and a barrier behavior analysis (BaBA) to assess the combined influence of ecological, infrastructural, and human tolerance covariates on spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) movement through a rapidly developing landscape in Nakuru County, Kenya. We found that hyenas appear to perceive fences as risky yet still cross them out of necessity, and that hyenas respond to different social-ecological factors depending on scale and management context, with human tolerance playing an important role in fine-scale movement decisions.image					; Xu, Wenjing/AAQ-3611-2021	Wilkinson, Christine/0000-0001-5462-0086; 													2045-7758					APR	2024	14	4							e11293	10.1002/ece3.11293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11293								38709888					WOS:001208025400001

Due to intensive sluice construction and other human disturbances, lakeshore vegetation has been destroyed and ecosystems greatly changed. Rhizospheric microbiota constitute a key part of a functioning rhizosphere ecosystem. Maintaining rhizosphere microbial diversity is a central, critical issue for sustaining these rhizospheric microbiota functions and associated ecosystem services. However, the community composition and abiotic factors influencing rhizospheric microbiota in lakeshore remain largely understudied. Methods. The spatiotemporal composition of lakeshore rhizospheric microbiota and the factors shaping them were seasonally investigated in three subtropical floodplain lakes (Lake Chaohu, Lake Wuchang, and Lake Dahuchi) along the Yangtze River in China through 16S rRNA amplicon high-throughput sequencing. Results. Our results showed that four archaeal and 21 bacterial phyla (97.04 +/- 0.25% of total sequences) dominated the rhizospheric microbiota communities of three lakeshore areas. Moreover, we uncovered significant differences among rhizospheric microbiota among the lakes, seasons, and average submerged depths. The Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Bathyarchaeota, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria differed significantly among the three lakes, with more than half of these dominant phyla showing significant changes in abundance between seasons, while the DHVEG-6, Ignavibacteriae, Nitrospirae, Spirochaetes, and Zixibacteria varied considerably across the average submerged depths (n = 58 sites in total). Canonical correspondence analyses revealed that the fluctuation range of water level and pH were the most important factors influencing the microbial communities and their dominant microbiota, followed by total nitrogen, moisture, and total phosphorus in soil. These results suggest a suite of hydrological and soil physiochemical variables together governed the differential structuring of rhizospheric microbiota composition among different lakes, seasons, and sampling sites. This work thus provides valuable ecological information to better manage rhizospheric microbiota and protect the vegetation of subtropical lakeshore areas.

UF membranes with a pore size of between 0.1 and 0.01 micrometres provide an effective barrier for bacteria, viruses, suspended particles, and colloids. The use of UF membrane technology in treating groundwater for the supply of potable water in the impoverished and rural village, Tshaanda (i.e., the study area) is demonstrated. The technical and administrative processes that are critical for the successful installation of the pilot plant were developed. Given the rural nature of Tshaanda, the cultural and traditional protocols were observed. Preliminary results of the water quality of untreated water and the permeate are presented. Escherichia coli in the untreated water during the dry season (i.e., June and July) was 2 cfu/100 ml and was <1 cfu/100 ml (undetected) following UF, which complied with the WHO and South African National Standards and Guidelines of,1 cfu/100 ml. During the wet/rainy season (February) total coliform was unacceptably high (>2419.2 cfu/100 ml) before UF. Following UF, it dramatically reduced to acceptable level (7 cfu/100 ml) which is within the WHO recommended level of,10 cfu/100 ml. Additionally, during the wet/rainy season E. coli and enterococci were unacceptably high (40.4 cfu/100 ml and 73.3 cfu/100 ml, respectively) before UF but were completely removed following UF, which are within the WHO and SANS recommended limit. The values for electrical conductivity (EC) and turbidity were constantly within the WHO recommended limits of 300 mu S/cm corrected at 25 degrees C and <5 NTU, respectively, before and after UF, during dry season and wet season. This suggests that there is no need for pre-treatment of the water for suspended particles and colloids. Considering these data, it can be concluded that the water is suitable for human consumption, following UF.

J	Nakajima, T				Nakajima, T			Hyperpycnites deposited 700 km away from river mouths in the central Japan Sea	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Relatively little is known about the characteristics of deposits and potential runout distances of hyperpycnal currents. This study describes and discusses evidence of sediment deposition from sustained (long-duration), quasi-steady turbidity currents in the distal part of the Toyama deep-sea channel, which extends ca. 700 km from river mouths in the central Japan Sea. The study is based on gravity cores and airgun seismic reflection profiles obtained from the channel distal reaches. The silty turbidite beds of the channel's terminal fan show rhythmic layering that indicates sustained turbidity currents with distinct flow-strength fluctuations. Some of the rhythmite beds show a fining-upward internal trend (net flow-strength waning), whereas others show an upward coarsening (net flow-strength waxing) followed by fining. Seismic reflection profiles from the channel levees show large bedforms of climbing-dune type, attributed to the spillover of thick sustained turbidity currents. The deposition of the terminal fan rhythmites and accretionary levee bedforms is attributed to turbidity currents generated by hyperpycnal river effluent. A quantitative assessment of sediment concentrations in the coastal rivers indicates that their effluents could become hyperpyenal nearly every year or during every major seasonal flood. The density of a river-generated underflow would increase by the entrainment of saline water and seafloor sediment on the steep slope of the Toyama Bay, resulting in robust, long-runout turbidity currents. The estimated flow velocities of these currents were around 0.3 m/s, and their recurrence period for the last 1000 years was of the order of 70 years. The estimated duration of hyperpycnal flows required for the deposition of rhythmite beds 700 km away from the river mouth is of the order of several days to 3-4 weeks. The study provides new insights into the recognition and classification of hyperpycnites in distal zones of deep-marine turbiditic systems.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				JAN-FEB	2006	76	1-2					60	73		10.2110/jsr.2006.13	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2006.13													WOS:000235746800005
J	Feng, Y; Song, CQ				Feng, Ye; Song, Chunqiao			Assessing the impacts of ice penetration on monitoring water levels of high-latitude and -altitude lakes from CryoSat-2 altimetry	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The CryoSat-2 satellite provides high-precision and long-term monitoring of global lake levels, offering advantages for water resource management, ecological protection, and disaster warning. However, the lake ice penetration by radar electromagnetic waves of CryoSat-2 altimetry tends to result in underestimation of water levels for lakes in high latitudes and altitudes. By contrast, the laser altimetry of ICESat-2 enables us to obtain the height measurements from lake ice surface and the ice penetration impacts on lake levels can be nearly ignored in the ICESat-2 elevation product. After converting the CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2 altimetry data to the same datum and height reference system, the water level difference of (near-) synchronous observations between the two satellites could be mainly attributed to the influences by the lake ice penetration from CryoSat-2 data. In this study, totally 257 lakes in high-latitude (north of 50 degrees N) and high-altitude (the Tibetan Plateau, TP) regions that are covered by both CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2 satellite tracks are examined to explore the characteristics of ice penetration impacts on water level measurements. The altimetry data during unfreezing seasons (June to October) are used to correct the systematic height biases of these two satellite measurements, thus their water level differences during freezing seasons (November to May of the following year) are deemed as the influences of ice penetration on lake level measurements by CryoSat-2 radar altimetry. The results show that the maximum underestimation depth of water level for each lake varies within the range of 0.01-3.47 m, with an average of 0.90 m. Particularly in North America with a dense distribution of lakes, the underestimation of lake levels by CryoSat-2 gradually ascends with increasing latitude. CryoSat-2 underestimates lake levels in Europe and the TP less than in North America. Among different months, the lake ice leads to the maximum underestimation on the water level by CryoSat-2 altimetry in March. The spatial and temporal characteristics of lake ice impacts on the water level measurements by CryoSat-2 altimetry would be an essential reference for quantifying and reducing the uncertainties of satellite radar altimetry for monitoring inland water dynamics.					; feng, ye/JMP-7925-2023	Song, Chunqiao/0000-0003-1060-4636; Feng, Ye/0009-0008-3727-9128													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2024	634								131147	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131147		MAR 2024											WOS:001223274200001

Anthropogenic alteration of the lake's hinterland from deforestation, fires, and agriculture threaten this crucial habitat through sediment pollution of the littoral environment. This study examines the sedimentology of these nearshore shell beds along a study area north of the Mahale Mountains (Tanzania) to test whether varying levels of watershed disturbance, determined by analysis of satellite imagery, within three moderately sized watersheds (> 100 km(2)) results in sedimentological differences offshore. The results show that shell beds adjacent to disturbed watersheds (Lagosa and Rukoma) contain more fine-grained sediment compared to shell beds offshore of the undisturbed watershed (Katumbi). Widespread burning, clearance, and land cultivation, and rains of the wet season are causal factors that result in significant differences in fine-grained sedimentation, larger sediment plumes offshore, and increased shoreline progradation. In areas most affected by sedimentation, sponges are largely absent, and shell coverage, which is a measure of fish-nesting capabilities, is lower. The discovery of a small population of live Neothauma tanganyicense offshore of the Katumbi river suggests that the presence of shell-bed forming gastropods in front of a relatively low disturbance watershed, and their conspicuous absence offshore of the other two watersheds, could be related to recent watershed disturbance and increased sedimentation. The increased fine-grained sedimentation and limited shell production by the reduced modern gastropod populations may signal that the shell-bed ecosystem of Lake Tanganyika is at risk.

Based on geomorphological, sedimentological, stratigraphical and chronological data, the lake began to form shortly after 648-551 cal. a BP. At its maximum, the lake covered an estimated area of 77 km(2) with a water volume of 1.2 km(3). Lake sediment up to 80 cm thick was rapidly deposited on top of terrestrial and marine sediments. At its maximum extent, the short-lived lake was the largest of any known Holocene lake in Svalbard. Modern river discharge would fill the lake to its highest shoreline at 23 m a.s.l. in only one season. Drainage was stepwise, as evidenced by four shorelines and abandoned drainage channels. This study has taken advantage of a unique suite of data available for such an ice-dammed lake. The results demonstrate the power of a multidisciplinary approach for recognizing lake events in the geological record, which is essential given the low preservation potential of such sediments.

Snowfall Replenishes Groundwater Loss in the Great Basin of the Western United States, but Cannot Compensate for Increasing Aridification	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												There has been an acceleration of groundwater loss in the Great Basin (GB) of the western U.S. as determined from total water storage (TWS) measurements from the GRACE/FO satellite missions. From 2002 to 2023, there was a loss of TWS in the GB of similar to 68.7 km3 which is more than six times the current volume of the Lake Mead Reservoir. In this arid/semi-arid region, groundwater is the primary factor contributing to the decade-scale decline in TWS. Stronger declining trends are found in the western versus the eastern GB. Snow loading is the major cause of seasonal fluctuations of TWS in the GB. Despite annual replenishment of groundwater by snow, the downward trend persists even in notable snow years. Likely causes include declining snow mass, upstream water diversions and increased evaporation/sublimation due to increasing temperatures. Dire consequences for humans and wildlife are associated with this large loss of groundwater. The 21st Century megadrought in the southwestern U.S. caused a dramatic acceleration of groundwater loss in the Great Basin (GB) of the western U.S. as determined from changes in the Earth's gravity measured by the GRACE satellites. Groundwater is a major component of total water storage (TWS) in the GB, but snowfall and snowmelt are the major causes of seasonal fluctuations of TWS. As a snowpack accumulates or melts, water is redistributed causing a rapid regional change in gravity that can be measured from space. From 2002 to 2023, there is a substantial loss of groundwater in the GB of similar to 68.7 km3 which is more than six times the current volume of water in the Lake Mead Reservoir in Arizona/Nevada. Stronger declining trends of groundwater loss are found in the western part of the GB while weaker declining trends are found in the eastern part. Despite annual replenishment by snowfall, even in notable snow years like 2010-2011, 2016-2017, 2018-2019, and 2022-2023, the downward trend of groundwater depletion persists. Likely causes for this decline include declining snow mass, upstream water diversions and increased evaporation/sublimation due to increasing air and surface temperatures. Groundwater depletion is associated with dire consequences for humans and wildlife. Snow accumulation in the Great Basin (GB) triggers an increase in total water storage (TWS) while snow ablation triggers a drop in TWS There is an 68.7 km3 loss of groundwater in the GB from 2002 to 2023 which is more than six times greater than the current volume of Lake Mead The 2002-2023 TWS decline in the GB is more pronounced in the western GB than in the eastern GB					Hall, Dorothy/D-5562-2012; Loomis, Bryant/AIC-7436-2022; Forman, Barton/I-2227-2012														0094-8276	1944-8007				MAR 28	2024	51	6							e2023GL107913	10.1029/2023GL107913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL107913													WOS:001187488000001

Sedimentology and palaeontology of the Upper Jurassic Puesto Almada Member (Canadon Asfalto Formation, Fossati sub-basin), Patagonia Argentina: Palaeoenvironmental and climatic significance	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Six facies associations are described for the Puesto Almada Member at the Cerro Bandera locality (Fossati sub-basin). They correspond to lacustrine, palustrine, and pedogenic deposits (limestones); and subordinated alluvial fan, fluvial, aeolian, and pyroclastic deposits. The lacustrine-palustrine depositional setting consisted of carbonate alkaline shallow lakes surrounded by flooded areas in a low-lying topography. The facies associations constitute four shallowing upward successions defined by local exposure surfaces: 1) a Lacustrine-Palustrinepedogenic facies association with a 'conchostracan'-ostracod association; 2) a Palustrine facies association representing a wetland subenvironment and yielding 'conchostracans', body remains of insects, fish scales, ichnofossils, and palynomorphs (cheirolepidiacean species and ferns growing around water bodies, and other gymnosperms in more elevated areas); 3) an Alluvial fan facies association indicating the source of sediment supply; and 4) a Lacustrine fades association representing a second wetland episode, and yielding 'conchostracans', insect ichnofossils, and a palynoflora mainly consisting of planktonic green algae associated with hygrophile elements. The invertebrate fossil assemblage found contains the first record of fossil insect bodies (Insecta-Hemiptera and Coleoptera) for the Canadon Asfalto Formation. The succession reflects a mainly climatic control over sedimentation. The sedimentary features of the Puesto Almada Member are in accordance with an arid climatic scenario across the Upper Jurassic, and they reflect a strong seasonality with periods of higher humidity represented by wetlands and lacustrine sediments.

Seedlings of the two birch species were grown in open-top chambers and were exposed to charcoal-filtered ambient air (CF) or non-filtered ambient air (NF) at the somma of Lake Mashu during the growing season in 2009. For the mountain birch, ambient ozone significantly increased the ratio of aboveground dry mass to belowground dry mass (TIR ratio), although no difference in the whole-plant biomass was observed between the treatments. For the white birch, in contrast, ozone exposure at ambient level did not decrease in growth and photosynthesis. These results suggest that ambient O-3 at the somma of Lake Mashu may shift the allocation of biomass to above-ground rather than below-ground in the mountain birch. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, adult tilapia, an euryoxic fish of high economic importance, were intraperitoneally injected with benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) (20 mg kg(-1)) and then exposed to graded hypoxia to assess combined effects on some detoxification and fitness parameters. Seventy-two hours after a stepped decrease in dissolved oxygen (<2 mg L-1), BaP treatment resulted in a significant diminution on the biliary BaP concentration (70% of normoxic group) and an increase in blood glucose levels (2.17-fold compared with normoxic group). These effects returned to control values in the following 48 h of hypoxia exposure. BaP-induced CYP1A mRNA levels were unaffected by hypoxia, suggesting that reduced bile BaP concentration may be related with effects on protein amount or enzyme activities. LDH mRNA levels, blood lactate and hematocrit remained without change, suggesting no extreme detrimental effects for tilapia in the short-term of the BaP-hypoxia challenge. Our results indicate that BaP treatment and hypoxia targeted glucose metabolism and biliary BaP elimination, probably by favoring the storage of BaP in tilapia tissues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among gram negative bacteria in sewage and lake water and influence of some physico-chemical parameters of water on conjugation process	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Transfer of antibiotic resistance genes among gram negative bacteria in sewage and lake water and easy access of these bacteria to the community are major environmental and public health concern, The aim of this study was to determine transfer of the antimicrobial resistance genes from resistant to susceptible gram negative bacteria in the sewage and lake water by conjugation process and to determine the influence of some physico-chemical parameters of sewage and lake water on the transfer of these resistance genes. For this reason, we isolated 20 liter of each sewage and lake water from coconut area within university campus and Lingambudi lake respectively in Mysore city, India, during monsoon season and studied different physical parameters of the water samples like pH, temperature, conductivity, turbidity and color as well as chemical parameters like BOD, COD, field DO and total chloride ion. The gram negative bacteria were isolated and identified from the above water samples using microbiological and biochemical methods and their sensitivity to different antibiotics was determined by disc diffusion break point assay. Conjugation between two multiple antibiotic resistant isolates Pseudomonas aeuginosa and E. coli as donor and E. coli Rif' (sensitive to antibiotics) as recipient were carded out in 5ml sterile sewage and lake water All isolates were resistant to Am, moderately resistant to Te and E, while majority were sensitive to Cip, Gm and CAZ antibiotics. Horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes by conjugation process revealed transfer of Gm, Te and E resistant genes from Ps. aeruginosa to E.coli Rif recipient with mean frequency of +/- 2.3 x 10(-4) in sewage and +/- 2.6 x 10(-6) in lake water respectively. Frequency of conjugation in sewage was two fold more as compared to lake water (p <= 0.05). Co-transfer study revealed simultaneous transfer of above resistant markers together to the recipient cells, As the above results indicate, due to selective pressure in sewage (presence of antibiotics), the isolates from sewage were more resistant to different antibiotics as compared to those from lake water Furthermore, these resistance genes can transfer to sensitive bacteria by conjugation. Physico-chemical parameters of water may play role in this process.					shakibaie, mohammad reza/M-8510-2015; shakibaie, mohammad/M-8510-2015	shakibaie, mohammad reza/0000-0003-2524-125X; 													0254-8704					JAN	2009	30	1			SI		45	49											20112862					WOS:000262706900008

However, little is known about the distribution of microbes and their influencing factors in ice-covered lakes worldwide. Here we analyzed the microbial community composition in the waters of 14 ice-covered lakes in the Hoh Xil region of northern QingTibetan Plateau (QTP), and conducted a meta-analysis by integrating published microbial community data of icecovered lakes in the tripolar regions (the Arctic, Antarctica and QTP). The results showed that there were significant differences in microbial diversity, community composition and distribution patterns in the ice-covered tripolar lakes. Microbial diversity and richness were lower in the ice-covered QTP lakes (including the studied lakes in the Hoh Xil region) than those in the Arctic and Antarctica. In the ice-covered lakes of Hoh Xil, prokaryotes are mainly involved in S-metabolic processes, making them more adaptable to extreme environmental conditions. In contrast, prokaryotes in the ice-covered lakes of the Arctic and Antarctica were predominantly involved in carbon/nitrogen metabolic processes. Deterministic (salinity and nutrients) and stochastic processes (dispersal limitation, homogenizing dispersal and drift) jointly determine the geographical distribution patterns of microorganisms in ice-covered lakes, with stochastic processes dominating. These results expand the understanding of microbial diversity, distribution patterns, and metabolic processes in polar ice-covered lakes.

Is Dust Derived From Shrinking Saline Lakes a Risk to Soil Sodification in Southern South America?	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Dry lakebeds exposed by shrinking water bodies in arid regions constitute sodium (Na)-rich mineral dust emission hotspots that may potentially affect agriculture through soil sodification. However, no soluble Na mass balance has so far been attempted. We modeled 13 years (2005-2017) of dust emission from Mar Chiquita (MC), the most extensive shrinking saline lake in South America. Based on a chemical characterization of dust, we found that a mean similar to 15-150 mg m(-2) of soluble Na was deposited 300 km from the source during the season of strongest dust emissions. We estimated the impact of this atmospheric input on 13 agricultural soils, with different rainfall regimes and water holding capacities. At most sites, dust-equilibrated infiltrated rainfall water had a Na concentration 8-7,000 times lower than the lowest concentration threshold proposed to trigger sodification. Additionally, this rainfall water is diluted similar to 2-20 times as it infiltrates in saturated soils, and its sodium adsorption ratio is probably reduced due to the abundance of soluble calcium and magnesium in the soil solution. Thus, there is no risk of short-term, seasonal sodification, except possibly at two sites and in close proximity to the dust source (<50 km), where dust deposition is maximum. At these sites, we estimated potential dust-related rises in the proportion of soil exchangeable Na. Under scenarios of enhanced salt-rich dust emissions from shrinking lakes in the twenty-first century, agricultural soils close to salt-rich dust sources worldwide should be monitored for potential Na enrichment related to Na-rich dust.

Thus, the fluctuation in water level is an important factor affecting the particle migration and deposition characteristics in the sand layers considered in projects such as groundwater recharge projects. Existing theories all treat the recharge aquifer as saturated, making it difficult to elucidate the mechanism of groundwater source heat pump recharge blockage in river and lake coastal areas. An extensive laboratory study was conducted here to assess the effect of water level changes on the deposition characteristics of particle migration in porous media. A one-dimensional sand layer migration-deposition test system was used to test particle transport and deposition characteristics at different water levels. The tests were carried out for two combinations of particle sizes at four water levels (110 mm, 220 mm, 330 mm, and 440 mm) and three seepage velocities (0.024 cm/s, 0.047 cm/s, and 0.071 cm/s). The results show that when the seepage velocity is kept constant and the water level is low, the particles flow through fewer pore channels, and as the water level increases, the particle flow through pore channels increases accordingly, so the particles are more easily deposited in the pore channels. This is ultimately reflected in the decrease in the peak relative concentration C/C-0 and the increase in the pore volume ratio P-v. When the water level remains constant, the hydrodynamic effect gradually becomes stronger as the seepage velocity increases, and the originally deposited particles may break away from the surface of the deposit and flow out with the water, resulting in a higher suspended particle concentration of the effluent and a higher C/C-0. Smaller particles are more affected by the hydrodynamic effect than larger particles.					; Fan, Yong/NRX-7553-2025	Fan, Yong/0009-0003-2808-9158; Cui, Xianze/0000-0003-4120-2971; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	2022	233	4							139	10.1007/s11270-022-05603-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05603-y													WOS:000779811000001

However, there are few studies that combine the use of slow-release fertilizer with MHDDF. We sought to explore the combined effect of MHDDF with slow-release fertilizer on rice yield and nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium utilization, compared to MFB. We compared three different MHDDF methods (D30: 450 kg ha(-1), D40: 600 kg ha(-1), D50: 750 kg ha(-1)), with one MFB method (B50: 750 kg ha(-1)), and one control (CK: 0 kg ha(-1)). We found that the yield of all MHDDF method was higher than that of both the MFB method. Yield was the highest in the D50 treatment and was 14.14-46.03% higher than that in B50 treatment. Biomass accumulation, nutrient accumulation, and nutrient use efficiency were similarly higher in MHDDF method than both MFB and CK. Compared to B50, the D50 treatment increased nitrogen recovery efficiency by 170.53-231.50%, phosphorus recovery efficiency by 480.00-724.25%, and potassium recovery efficiency by 201.55-169.59%. Overall, we found that combining MHDDF with slow-release fertilizer was an effective method to increase rice yield and nutrient use efficiency compared with MFB.																			0721-7595	1435-8107				MAR	2023	42	3					1604	1613		10.1007/s00344-022-10645-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-022-10645-x		APR 2022											WOS:000777238000001
J	Liu, X; Qian, KM; Chen, YW; Wang, XL				Liu, Xia; Qian, Kuimei; Chen, Yuwei; Wang, Xiaolong			Spatial and seasonal variation in N2-fixing cyanobacteria in Poyang Lake from 2012 to 2016: roles of nutrient ratios and hydrology	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Large river floodplain systems provide a variety of societal, economic and biological benefits and are undergoing extensive and intensive environmental deterioration. Eutrophication coupled with undesired harmful cyanobacterial blooms is one of the most widespread and severe problems in floodplain ecosystems. However, our knowledge about cyanobacteria, particularly the biogeography of N-2-fixing (Nfix) cyanobacteria in shallow floodplain lakes, is very limited, and the relationships of cyanobacterial blooms with nutrient ratios and hydrological alterations remain unclear. We used a comprehensive database of field data compiled over several years (2012 to 2016) to compare the biomass and distribution of Nfix cyanobacteria between the northern (high water velocity) and southern (low water velocity) parts of Poyang Lake and to investigate the roles of hydrology and the critical nutrient mass ratios of total nitrogen:total phosphorus (TN:TP) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen:orthophosphate (DIN:PO4-P) as significant predictors of Nfix cyanobacterial biomass and distribution in eutrophic floodplain ecosystems. Dolichospermum spp. (Dolichospermum flos-aquae, D. azotica, D. circinalis, and D. spiroides) were the most widely distributed and frequent diazotrophic cyanobacteria in the regions considered in this study, followed by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. The Nfix cyanobacterial biomass was generally low (mean=0.32mg/l) across Poyang Lake and was lower in the north than in the south. Using Spearman's rank correlations, we found that this pattern may be attributed to the high turbidity and washout from the high velocity of water flow in the north. The filament length and heterocyst frequency of Dolichospermum spp. in the lake were also strongly linked to variations in hydrological characteristics and water temperature. Our results imply that the nutrient mass ratios are more important determinants of Nfix cyanobacterial biomass than hydrology in the south part of the lake. The critical TN:TP mass ratio for the Nfix cyanobacterial communities in Poyang Lake is approximately 20, and the critical DIN:PO4-P mass ratio in the lake is approximately 40. Our analysis provides new information regarding the occurrence of bloom-forming Nfix cyanobacteria in Yangtze River floodplain lakes and thus fills an important knowledge gap in subtropical freshwater ecosystems.					; 陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023	Liu, Xia/0000-0002-6225-9179; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2019	81	3							47	10.1007/s00027-019-0639-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-019-0639-y													WOS:000465204900001
J	Spiliotopoulos, M; Loukas, A				Spiliotopoulos, Marios; Loukas, Athanasios			Hybrid Methodology for the Estimation of Crop Coefficients Based on Satellite Imagery and Ground-Based Measurements	WATER												The objective of the current study was the investigation of specific relationships between crop coefficients and vegetation indices (VI) computed at the water-limited environment of Lake Karla Watershed, Thessaly, in central Greece. A Mapping ET (evapotranspiration) at high Resolution and with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model was used to derive crop coefficient values during the growing season of 2012. The proposed methodology was developed using medium resolution Landsat 7 ETM+ images and meteorological data from a local weather station. Cotton, sugar beets, and corn fields were utilized. During the same period, spectral signatures were obtained for each crop using the field spectroradiometer GER1500 (Spectra Vista Corporation, NY, U.S.A.). Relative spectral responses (RSR) were used for the filtering of the specific reflectance values giving the opportunity to match the spectral measurements with Landsat ETM+ bands. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) were then computed, and empirical relationships were derived using linear regression analysis. NDVI, SAVI, and EVI2 were tested separately for each crop. The resulting equations explained those relationships with a very high R-2 value (>0.86). These relationships have been validated against independent data. Validation using a new image file after the experimental period gives promising results, since the modeled image file is similar in appearance to the initial one, especially when a crop mask is applied. The CROPWAT model supports those results when using the new crop coefficients to estimate the related crop water requirements. The main benefit of the new approach is that the derived relationships are better adjusted to the crops. The described approach is also less time-consuming because there is no need for atmospheric correction when working with ground spectral measurements.

J	Ye, XC; Guo, Q; Zhang, ZX; Xu, CY				Ye, Xuchun; Guo, Qiang; Zhang, Zengxin; Xu, Chongyu			Assessing Hydrological and Sedimentation Effects from Bottom Topography Change in a Complex River-Lake System of Poyang Lake, China	WATER												In recent years, a dramatic decline in Poyang Lake water levels and a shrinking water surface have raised concerns about water security and the wetland ecosystem. Changes in bottom topography due to sand mining activities in the lake was supposed to be one of the influencing factors of these changes. In response to this issue, the current study analyzed the change of lake bottom topography from observed digital elevation model (DEM) data, and quantitatively assessed the spatial and temporal responses of lake hydrology based on the framework of the neural network and the sediment effect was examined afterward. Results showed a total volume of 11.54 x 10(8) m(3)/year (about 0.96 x 10(8) m(3)/year or 1.58 x 10(8) t/year sediment) in net change of lake bottom topography in recent years, among which 97% was directly exported by commercial sand mining. During the study period, 2000-2011, intensive sand mining extended the central part of Poyang Lake and widened and deepened the outflow channel of the northern lake. This great change of lake bottom topography caused an average annual increase of 182.74 m(3)/s of lake outflow and a decline of 0.23 m-0.61 m in water levels across the lake. However, lake water levels are not consistent and show remarkable spatial and seasonal differences. The effects of changes in lake bottom topography on lake hydrological processes continue to grow as sand mining activities in the lake continue. More research on the environmental impacts is required for sustainable management of the lake ecosystem.

J	Biagioni, S; Wündsch, M; Haberzettl, T; Behling, H				Biagioni, Siria; Wuendsch, Michael; Haberzettl, Torsten; Behling, Hermann			Assessing resilience/sensitivity of tropical mountain rainforests towards climate variability of the last 1500 years: The long-term perspective at Lake Kalimpaa (Sulawesi, Indonesia)	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The tropical montane rainforests of the Lore Lindu National Park in Sulawesi, Indonesia provide many ecosystem services for the population inhabiting the area and harbor unique biodiversity in a key area for phytogeography. The mountain regions of Central Sulawesi experience perhumid climate conditions with few seasonal changes in precipitation, making the vegetation a possible sensitive target for future changes of precipitation patterns. The ecological consequences are hard to predict due to the lack of knowledge of the dynamical processes that govern these tropical forests. This research aims to shed light on the long-term response of the montane vegetation of Lore Lindu National Park to stress caused by climate variability and human activities in the past. Palynological data are used to reconstruct forest vegetation dynamics and are compared to centennial time scale data of fire frequencies, palaeorainfall proxies and regional climate reconstructions to assess the drivers of these changes. Results reveal that the Fagaceae family dominates the entire recorded period, as they still do today. Fire episodes occurred locally only ten times in the last 1500 years but two periods were characterized by higher frequencies: between ca. AD 1070 and 1200 and between ca. AD 1450 and 1660. The regional correlation of these events with periods of drought registered in Java suggests that centennial-scale increases in fire frequencies at Lake Kalimpaa were consequences of the vegetation being more prone to fire, probably due to more frequent or more intense El Nino events. In both cases Fagaceae did not decrease, indicating resilience towards droughts and fires of at least one species of that family. Following the first period of increased fire frequencies, the vegetation went through a long secondary forest phase lasting about two and a half centuries (ca. AD 1200-1450). Weinmannia was co-dominant together with Lithocarpus/Castanopsis. The second period of increased fire frequencies corresponds to a phase when records across the tropics show that the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was displaced to the south. High effective rainfall enhanced the growing of swamp taxa like Pandanus around the lake. Human-landscape interactions are evident only starting from the 20th century (from ca. 1950 to present) with Weinmannia rising probably due to the logging of emergent Agathis trees and/or landslides caused by the construction of the road which today passes near the lake. In general, palynological diversity values indicate that within-landscape diversity (Whittaker's gamma diversity) decreased when fires increased. Palynological rate of change and compositional turnover indicate that the vegetation communities were more resilient to fire disturbance during period of high rainfall. A different trend is apparent starting from the second half of the 20th century, suggesting a change in the dynamical response of the vegetation communities to forest fires, possibly as a consequence of increasing human activities around the lake. The emergent tree Agathis, while being more responsive to long-term rainfall variability in the past, did not reestablish itself following the years of intensive selective logging in the second part of the last century. These findings improve our knowledge of the long-term ecology of Central Sulawesi, one of the world's hotspots of biodiversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TROPHIC STATE IN VOYAGEURS NATIONAL PARK LAKES BEFORE AND AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF A REVISED WATER-LEVEL MANAGEMENT PLAN	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												We compiled Secchi depth, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a (Chla) data from Voyageurs National Park lakes and compared datasets before and after a new water-level management plan was implemented in January 2000. Average Secchi depth transparency improved (from 1.9 to 2.1m, p=0.020) between 1977-1999 and 2000-2011 in Kabetogama Lake for August samples only and remained unchanged in Rainy, Namakan, and Sand Point Lakes, and Black Bay in Rainy Lake. Average open-water season Chla concentration decreased in Black Bay (from an average of 13 to 6.0g/l, p=0.001) and Kabetogama Lake (from 9.9 to 6.2g/l, p=0.006) between 1977-1999 and 2000-2011. Trophic state index decreased significantly in Black Bay from 59 to 51 (p=0.006) and in Kabetogama Lake from 57 to 50 (p=0.006) between 1977-1999 and 2000-2011. Trophic state indices based on Chla indicated that after 2000, Sand Point, Namakan, and Rainy Lakes remained oligotrophic, whereas eutrophication has decreased in Kabetogama Lake and Black Bay. Although nutrient inputs from inflows and internal sources are still sufficient to produce annual cyanobacterial blooms and may inhibit designated water uses, trophic state has decreased for Kabetogama Lake and Black Bay and there has been no decline in lake ecosystem health since the implementation of the revised water-level management plan.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				FEB	2015	51	1					99	111		10.1111/jawr.12234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jawr.12234													WOS:000349151900007

A.; Barbosa, Francisco; Hajnal, Eva; Padisak, Judit			Role of atelomixis in replacement of phytoplankton assemblages in Dom Helvecio Lake, South-East Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Scale and frequency of changes in a lake's physical structure, light dynamics, and availability of nutrients are closely related to phytoplankton ecology. Since phytoplankton assemblages were first described, phytoplankton ecologists concluded that these assemblages provide insight into phytoplankton responses to environmental changes. Objectives of this study were to investigate ecology of phytoplankton during a complete hydrological cycle in the deepest natural lake in Brazil, Dom Helvecio, and to sort species into the list of assemblages, checking its accordance with environmental changes in a tropical system within the middle Rio Doce Lake district, South-East Brazil. Canonical Correspondence Analysis, t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to analyze climatological, environmental, and plankton data, which were obtained monthly in 2002. A new phytoplankton assemblage, N-A (atelomixis-dependent desmids), is suggested because atelomixis (robust movement of water occurring once a day) contributed to replacement of species in Dom Helvecio Lake. Stability of stratification, water chemistry, and composition of phytoplankton assemblages characterized two periods. The first period occurred in six rainy months (Jan-Mar and Oct-Dec) when the lake was stratified and phytoplankton was dominated by two assemblages: N-A and F. The second period occurred in six dry months (Apr-Sep) when the lake was nonstratified and phytoplankton was dominated by four assemblages: S2, X1, A, and L-O. Results suggest that phytoplankton in Dom Helvecio Lake was shaped by seasonal and daily changes of water temperature, even with its lower amplitude of variation within 2002 (El Nino year). These changes promoted water column stratification or mixing, reduced light, and increased nutrient availability. Temperature, therefore, is similarly important to phytoplankton ecology in tropical regions as it is in temperate ones. Sorting phytoplankton species into assemblages matched well with environmental changes and periods identified so it is also suggested that this can be further used as an appropriate tool to manage water quality when evaluating tropical lakes.

J	Yin, Y; Sheng, YH; He, YF; Qin, JR				Yin, Yue; Sheng, Yehua; He, Yufeng; Qin, Jiarui			Modeling vague spatiotemporal objects based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												Fuzziness is an inherent property of geographical phenomena and the processes of data acquisition, processing, and analysis often introduce uncertainty. Existing methods predominantly use fuzzy set (FS) theory to capture the fuzziness of geographical phenomena as fuzzy spatial objects. However, this approach has a conceptual confusion regarding fuzziness, uncertainty, and vagueness, and the membership degree is expressed using accurate values that ignore uncertainty. Furthermore, FS-based methods lack a vague temporal descriptor. Herein, a vague-spatiotemporal-object model based on the interval type-2 FS theory is proposed to express the vagueness of spatiotemporal objects. To verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method, the fuzzy and vague clustering algorithm was used to classify the vegetation cover types on Poyang Lake Plain, China. Furthermore, the classification accuracy was validated via field investigations, and its ability to identify the wet season of the area was verified via the annual vague water area changes of Poyang Lake. The results indicate that, compared with the spatial object model based on FSs, the proposed method increases the ability to measure membership error and express spatiotemporal vagueness.

J	Clayer, F; Gélinas, Y; Tessier, A; Gobeil, C				Clayer, Francois; Gelinas, Yves; Tessier, Andre; Gobeil, Charles			Mineralization of organic matter in boreal lake sediments: rates, pathways, and nature of the fermenting substrates	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The complexity of organic matter (OM) degradation mechanisms represents a significant challenge for developing biogeochemical models to quantify the role of aquatic sediments in the climate system. The common representation of OM by carbohydrates formulated as CH2O in models comes with the assumption that its degradation by fermentation produces equimolar amounts of methane (CH4) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). To test the validity of this assumption, we modelled using reaction-transport equation vertical profiles of the concentration and isotopic composition (delta C-13) of CH4 and DIC in the top 25 cm of the sediment column from two lake basins, one whose hypolimnion is perennially oxygenated and one with seasonal anoxia. Furthermore, we modelled solute porewater profiles reported in the literature for four other seasonally anoxic lake basins. A total of 17 independent porewater datasets are analyzed. CH4 and DIC production rates associated with methanogenesis at the five seasonally anoxic sites collectively show that the fermenting OM has a mean (+/- SD) carbon oxidation state (COS) value of 1.4 +/- 0.3. This value is much lower than the value of zero expected from carbohydrate fermentation. We conclude that carbohydrates do not adequately represent the fermenting OM in hypolimnetic sediments and propose to include the COS in the formulation of OM fermentation in models applied to lake sediments to better quantify sediment CH4 outflux. This study highlights the potential of mass balancing the products of OM mineralization to characterize labile substrates undergoing fermentation in sediments.

J	Gerard, C; Carpentier, A; Paillisson, JM				Gerard, Claudia; Carpentier, Alexandre; Paillisson, Jean-Marc			Long-term dynamics and community structure of freshwater gastropods exposed to parasitism and other environmental stressors	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Freshwater communities are subject to various abrupt environmental disturbances and increasing pollution levels in their habitat. According to the nature and the periodicity of disturbances (i.e. punctuated, recurrent or continuous), one may expect different kinds of response of the target gastropod communities. 2. The gastropod community of a French lake has been investigated for 10 years to study its responses to three main environmental disturbances: supra-seasonal droughts, recurrent proliferations of cyanobacteria and parasitism by trematodes. The relationship between this latter factor, considered as a continuous stressor, and the gastropod community was a particular focus. 3. A total of 13 280 gastropods belonging to 17 species (mostly Pulmonata with Planorbidae as the dominant family) have been sampled in the lake over the 10-year time series. Species composition of the gastropod community varied strongly during the study period as did species richness (0-14, mean of 6.5 +/- 0.4 species) and abundance of gastropods (0-4456, mean of 192 +/- 72 individuals). Trematode larvae belonging to 11 morphotypes of cercariae were detected in 15 of the 17 species of gastropods and had a total prevalence of 2.9%. 4. Droughts (punctuated stressor) were responsible for the disappearance of nearly all gastropod species, and thus represent a severe environmental stressor for them. Nevertheless, the extent of this stressor was limited since the gastropod community was highly resilient. 5. Recurrent proliferations of toxic cyanobacteria (recurrent stressor) coincided with the large decline of the gastropod community, corresponding to a strong decrease in abundance and species richness. Intoxication of gastropods by toxic cyanobacteria was demonstrated by the bioaccumulation of microcystins in all gastropod tissues. 6. Trematode parasitism (continuous stressor) did not affect the gastropod community despite the possibly strong impact of parasites on some host species (those with monthly prevalence as high as 100% at some times). Indeed, abundance and species richness of gastropods were scarcely influenced by trematode prevalence or species richness.

Natural soda lakes provide compatible conditions for RNA and membrane function that could have enabled the origin of life	PNAS NEXUS												The origin of life likely occurred within environments that concentrated cellular precursors and enabled their co-assembly into cells. Soda lakes (those dominated by Na+ ions and carbonate species) can concentrate precursors of RNA and membranes, such as phosphate, cyanide, and fatty acids. Subsequent assembly of RNA and membranes into cells is a long-standing problem because RNA function requires divalent cations, e.g. Mg2+, but Mg2+ disrupts fatty acid membranes. The low solubility of Mg-containing carbonates limits soda lakes to moderate Mg2+ concentrations (similar to 1 mM), so we investigated whether both RNAs and membranes function within these lakes. We collected water from Last Chance Lake and Goodenough Lake in Canada. Because we sampled after seasonal evaporation, the lake water contained similar to 1 M Na+ and similar to 1 mM Mg2+ near pH 10. In the laboratory, nonenzymatic, RNA-templated polymerization of 2-aminoimidazole-activated ribonucleotides occurred at comparable rates in lake water and standard laboratory conditions (50 mM MgCl2, pH 8). Additionally, we found that a ligase ribozyme that uses oligonucleotide substrates activated with 2-aminoimidazole was active in lake water after adjusting pH from similar to 10 to 9. We also observed that decanoic acid and decanol assembled into vesicles in a dilute solution that resembled lake water after seasonal rains, and that those vesicles retained encapsulated solutes despite salt-induced flocculation when the external solution was replaced with dry-season lake water. By identifying compatible conditions for nonenzymatic and ribozyme-catalyzed RNA assembly, and for encapsulation by membranes, our results suggest that soda lakes could have enabled cellular life to emerge on Earth, and perhaps elsewhere.					; Ding, Dian/GON-5496-2022; Catling, David/D-2082-2009	Ding, Dian/0000-0001-9046-7816; Sinclair, Kimberly/0000-0001-6261-4591; Zhou, Lijun/0000-0002-0393-4787; Catling, David/0000-0001-5646-120X; Szostak, Jack/0000-0003-4131-1203; Cohen, Zachary/0000-0002-1257-623X; Haas, Sebastian/0000-0001-6705-0449														2752-6542				FEB 29	2024	3	3							pgae084	10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae084		MAR 2024						38505692					WOS:001190766500018

Todd; Barton, David R.; Fietsch, Cherie-Lee; Kaltenecker, Georgina			Fine-scale nutrient enrichment and water quality on the rural shores of Southeast Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recently, there has been public concern that water quality in the nearshore of Southeast Lake Huron has been deteriorating, inferred partly from fouling of shoreline by algae. In 2010, fine-scale patterns in nutrient concentrations and other water quality features were examined to better understand the influence of the adjacent land on the nearshore environment in the region. Surveys at two areas of coastline were conducted over a seasonal cycle. Monitoring of water quality in tributaries to the study areas indicated that water of poor quality was periodically discharged to the lake as indicated by elevated levels of nutrients, fecal indicator bacteria, suspended solids and chloride. The extent of the nearshore that was directly influenced by land runoff was small, restricted to the shoreline fringe, relative to the broader nearshore. Pulse-like inputs of phosphorus from wave-induced erosional events and periods of precipitation-related runoff, both characterized by high levels of particle-bound phosphorus, contributed to highly dynamic and spatially variable levels of total phosphorus (TP), and proportions of TP in dissolved form, in the nearshore. The proportion of TP associated with particulate material was strongly correlated with lake depth. Phosphorus distributions in the nearshore indicate contrasting conditions with proximity to shoreline. Land runoff enriches nutrient levels along sections of the immediate shoreline, which contrasts sharply with the ultraoligotrophic conditions in the broader nearshore. The nearshore of Lake Huron arguably has always been highly sensitive to phosphorus pollution and it appears likely that the shoreline may be even more so today.

Methods for rearing the invasive zooplankter Bythotrephes in the laboratory	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												The invasive spiny water flea's (Bythotrephes longimanus) current North American distribution encompasses the Laurentian Great Lakes as well as a number of inland lakes, particularly on the Canadian Shield. In the past, poor survival in the laboratory has precluded controlled long-term studies on Bythotrephes. Here we investigated field collection techniques and choices of culture media, temperature, and diet that led to the successful maintenance of Bythotrephes from birth to reproduction. Gravid parthenogenic females were collected from invaded lakes. Resulting offspring were reared in source lake water filtered through 20 or 80 mu m, or a fully defined artificial culture medium, FLAMES. Individuals raised in FLAMES produced significantly larger broods than those in lake water, indicating that it is an appropriate culture medium. We next conducted a 96-h temperature bioassay on juvenile Bythotrephes. Survival was comparable at 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 24 degrees C but decreased after 48 h at 28 degrees C, and most animals died after 24 h at 32 degrees C. We also reared Bythotrephes at 16 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 25 degrees C. Corresponding intrinsic rates of natural increase (r) for animals maintained to first brood release were 0.02, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.03 d(-1), suggesting that Bythotrephes should be reared at similar to 22 degrees C to benefit from maximum population increases. Feeding trials confirmed that young Bythotrephes prefer small, slow-moving prey. Finally, we devised a protocol for rearing Bythotrephes that yielded 100% survival to reproduction and r = 0.10 d(-1) (for animals maintained to first brood release).

A clustering technique which merges the satellite observations is used to detect inundation. Monthly flooded areas are then calculated by estimating pixel fractional coverage of flooding using the passive microwave signal and a linear mixture model with end-members calibrated with radar observations to account for vegetation cover. The global results, comprising natural wetlands, irrigated rice, and lakes/rivers, indicate a minimum inundated area for the July 1992-June 1993 period of 2.16 x 10(6) km(2), about 38% of the maximum 5.75 x 10(6) km(2), to be compared to maximum areas of 5.83 x 10(6) km(2) and 5.70 x 10(6) km(2) from independent data sets. Comprehensive evaluation requires substantial additions to the sparse observational record now available.

The data were processed for the period from 2000 to 2017 using vegetation and water surface indices. The results of flood mapping were verified with the ground reference data, indicating the overall accuracy of 88.7% and Kappa coefficient of 0.77, respectively. These findings were confirmed by close agreement between the flood-mapping area and ground reference data, with the correlation coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.94. The flood-prone areas were generally concentrated along the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake. The seasonal flooded areas observed for 2010, 2015 and 2016 were remarkably smaller than other years, mainly attributed to the El Nino weather phenomenon exacerbated by impacts of climate change. Eventually, the probability of flood occurrence during this 18-year period with reference to percentage of population at the district level was calculated for flood management purposes.

Factors affecting diatom distribution in floodplain lakes of the southeast Murray Basin, Australia and implications for palaeolimnological studies	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Diatom assemblages of surface sediments in 46 billabongs from four river floodplains in the southeast Murray-Darling Basin, Australia were sampled to investigate drivers of species distribution. The principal purpose of the study was to derive information to aid interpretation of diatom-based palaeoecological studies of these systems and of floodplain lakes more generally. Patterns in billabong diatom assemblages in relation to river reach, hydrology and farming intensity on surrounding land were examined, as were correlations with water quality variables. Seasonal variation in billabong water quality was high relative to spatial variation, and spatial patterns in billabong water quality were weak. In contrast, strong patterns were evident in diatom assemblages. Three main patterns were observed: (1) a distinction between billabongs dominated by planktonic diatoms from those dominated by benthic and attached forms; (2) differences in diatom assemblages in billabongs on different river reaches; and (3) differences in assemblages in billabongs with different hydrology. Of all water quality variables tested, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and pH exerted the strongest independent influence on diatom distribution; however, only TP remained an important variable when species variation due to river reach, hydrology, and aquatic plant cover was taken into account. The weak influence of water quality on diatom distribution is interpreted as reflecting the dichotomy between plankton and non-plankton-dominated billabongs, the influence of hydrology and biogeography, the lack of strong spatial water quality gradients and the high degree of temporal variability in water quality. The findings show that diatom records from billabong sediments can provide evidence of long-term changes in the abundance of aquatic macrophytes and hydrology. They also suggest that merging calibration data sets across regions for the purpose of improving diatom transfer functions for water quality reconstruction is of limited value for floodplain lakes, and that performance is more likely to be gained by boosting site numbers within regions.

While the accumulation and decomposition of POM can enhance nutrient cycling at a rate depending on the property of lake-water organic carbon, it is important to identify the source of suspended POM for evaluating eutrophication and carbon burial. Here we analyzed the distribution of stable isotopic ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and the carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) in suspended POM in a shallow eutrophic lake of subtropical China, for apportioning the POM sources using Bayesian mixing model. Specifically, we collected seasonal samples of lake-water POM (>0.7 mu m) from 20 sites in Yilong Lake from September 2020 to June 2022, as well as six types of modern samples covering the main carbon sources in the catchment. The spatial surveys showed that in the dry year (low water level) the delta C-13 of POM was more enriched in the western basin than those in the central and eastern basins, while the seasonal surveys showed the most enriched delta C-13 of POM in September. However, this spatio-temporal heterogeneity disappeared in the wet year (high water level). It was also found that the delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values of POM varied significantly with those of phytoplankton across sites and seasons. Application of the MixSIAR model further showed that phytoplankton was the predominant source of POM in Yilong Lake (79.8 +/- 13.4 %), but with large annual difference, 68.9 +/- 10.3 % in the dry year and 90.7 +/- 3.7 % in the wet year. In comparison, the contribution of the other five endmembers was much more moderate. In particular, the proportion of allochthonous organic carbon in POM was relatively low, with terrestrial plants and soils contributing 6.1 +/- 4.8 % and 4.3 +/- 2.5 % of POM, respectively. Our quantitative evidence for the dominance of the autochthonous source (i.e., phytoplankton) in lake-water POM over time and space suggested a determining role of eutrophication in the composition of lake organic carbon. Therefore, the coupling of algal blooms with organic carbon cycling in inland waters can be enhanced with continuous catchment development and regional warming.

Soil phosphorus pools for Histosols under sugarcane and pasture in the Everglades, USA	GEODERMA												Land use changes in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) in southern Florida may influence the distribution and availability of P. Cultivated soils in the EAA are being converted back to their historic use as seasonally-flooded prairies as part of Everglades restoration projects. The objectives of this study were to determine the distribution of P in soil chemical fractions in relation to long-term land management to predict P cycling and transformations for future land uses. Soil under pasture (100 yr) and planted to sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) for 50 yr were amended with P (0, 10, 50,150 kg P ha(-1)), and its distribution in labile, Fe-Al bound P, Ca-bound P, humic-fulvic acid P, and residual P pools determined for surface soil (0-15 cm). Most P fertilizer entered Fe-Al and Ca-bound fractions. Cultivation contributed to higher pH and increased the Ca content in soil compared to pasture due to incorporation of bedrock limestone into soil by tillage. The land uses were differentiated by P storage in different pools. Subsequently, long-term fertilization increased soil total P for cultivated soil relative to pasture, but plant-available P constituted less than 1% of the total P. Labile P increased with increasing P application rate, ranging from 1.3 to 7.2 mg kg(-1) for cultivated soil and 1.4 to 10.7 mg kg(-1) for pasture. Most of the applied P was recovered in the Fe-Al fraction for pasture and the Ca-bound P fraction for cultivated soil. The Ca-bound P fraction represented the greatest proportion of total P for sugarcane (41%), but only 12% for pasture. The majority of P in the pasture was present in the humic-fulvic acid fraction (45%), compared to only 23% for sugarcane. The higher pH of the cultivated soil (6.8) favored retention in Ca fractions while the lower pH of pasture (5.3) favored P retention in the humic-fulvic acid fraction. The proportion of total P as organic P was greater for pasture (78%) than cultivated soil (52%). Higher P levels in more recalcitrant fractions for cultivated soils indicated that more of the applied fertilizer P was sequestered in stable fractions, which decreased P availability to crops and may subsequently increase P fertilizer requirements necessary to maintain optimal plant-available nutrient levels. Subsequently, continuation of current farming practices and tillage regimes promotes the redistribution of Ca from subsurface to surface soil, which leads to greater P sequestration in the Ca-bound fraction. However, P in inorganic fractions may be released upon onset of changes in land use. Thus, conversion to seasonally-flooded prairies may have a more dramatic effect on P release from cultivated than pasture soils since cultivated soils have more P in inorganic pools.

J	Huang, W; Li, CY; Rivera-Monroy, VH				Huang, Wei; Li, Chunyan; Rivera-Monroy, Victor H.			Cold fronts control multiscale spatiotemporal hydroperiod patterns in a man-made subtropical coastal delta (Wax Lake Region, Louisiana USA)	OCEAN DYNAMICS												Atmospheric cold fronts quasi-periodically produce storm surges and generate significant subtidal oscillations of water levels and water transport in coastal environments. Yet, it is unclear how these weather events-at regional scales -control the hydrodynamics in delta-dominated coasts. Here, we used a numerical model (SCHISM) to simulate the inundation/drying and water circulations generated by varying winds associated with cold front passages across the Atchafalaya Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico, specifically the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) region. Water transport induced by winds through major channels of the WLD and that between the adjacent Vermilion Bay and inner shelf were quantified to evaluate the impact of cold fronts. Results show that significant wetting/drying conditions are highly correlated with wind direction and strength. Southerly/easterly winds tend to cause water set-up, thus inundating the delta region, while northerly and westerly winds cause water set-down, draining the bay into the continental shelf. As a result, up to 60% of the delta area (similar to 50 km(2)) can become exposed land under northerly winds. The interconnectivity of the delta channel system is also highly dependent on the wind direction and magnitude: up to 37% of the total transport is through the shallow waters outside of the channels during cold fronts. In contrast, the water levels and velocity variations in the delta region were negatively correlated with the alongshore wind, a result of Ekman transport. At the delta head, where freshwater flows like a strong jet into the region, the velocity is marginally correlated with the wind but mostly correlated with seasonal river discharge variability of river discharge. At the transitional zone between the bay and coastal ocean, water level and surface flows are dominated by tidal forcing in contrast to the delta lobes area where wind regulates the flooding area extension. The bottom velocity and water levels at sites along the Atchafalaya Bay mouth negatively correlate with onshore wind, indicating bottom return flows against the wind. Our study offers a glimpse of how a combination of atmospheric and hydrodynamic forces operate in a young delta, where the coast is experiencing the highest sea level rise in North America.

This method has not been validated and tested on independent data, hence the aim of the study was to check the applicability of this method and the sensitivity of different phytoplankton metrics along pressure gradient. Phytoplankton data were collected from 33 Polish lowland lakes (20 stratified, 13 non-stratified), during the growth season in the period from 2005 to 2009. The biomass of phytoplankton was calculated from cell volume measurements and chlorophyll a concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by the alcohol method. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations were determined by standard methods (PN-EN ISO 6878:2006p.7 and PN-EN 25663:2001, respectively) and water transparency was measured using a Secchi disk. For comparability, an ecological status was determined according to three phytoplankton-based methods: Polish, German and Hungarian. Polish metrics showed a strong correlation with the other metrics (German, Hungarian), which are broadly and successfully used for assessment in Europe. However, a statistically significant correlation was found between all the metric values and the main parameters: total phosphorus, total nitrogen and Secchi disk visibility. The metrics based on quantitative phytoplankton features were more sensitive to the growth of eutrophication than others, based on indicator taxa. Total phosphorus demonstrated a stronger relationship with the tested metrics than total nitro-gen. Phytoplankton metrics reacted quite well to pressure gradients because of the decreasing tendency of metric values along the TP and TN gradient and an increasing tendency along the Secchi disk visibility gradient. The multimetric PMPL may be recommended as useful for the assessment of the ecological status of Polish lakes.					; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018; Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka/AAO-9883-2021; Hutorowicz, Andrzej/O-5061-2019	Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka/0000-0001-5857-1189; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290; Hutorowicz, Andrzej/0000-0002-2976-1079													1644-2296					JUN	2012	17	2					289	303		10.5601/jelem.2012.17.2.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.5601/jelem.2012.17.2.11													WOS:000308575400011

To investigate temporal and spatial variations in PAH concentrations, composition and possible source categories, 29 sediment samples were collected from Taihu Lake during both the flooding and dry seasons of the lake. Fifteen US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs were detected in 58 surface sediments (29 for each season) by gas chromatograph/mass selective detection, following extraction by accelerated solvent extraction. The concentrations of the total and individual PAHs in the flooding season were higher than those in the dry season, suggesting that high levels of fishing activity may be an important contributor to PAH pollution in the flooding season. The fractions of high molecular weight PAHs in the flooding season ranged from 63 % to 71 % and were higher than those in the dry season (which ranged from 52 % to 65 %). These results indicate that vehicle exhaust may be a more important pollutant source in the flooding season than in the dry season. Diagnostic ratios, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to study possible source categories in the different seasons. Consistent results were obtained for all techniques. Seasonal and spatial variations were also investigated by the coefficient of divergence method. The results of previous studies support the conclusion of source identification. Vehicle emissions were the dominant contributor to PAHs in the flooding season, while PAHs in the dry season sediments may have come from multiple sources. The findings of this study may provide a theoretical basis for seasonal PAH control strategies for Taihu Lake.					; Tian, Ying-Ze/I-5774-2012; Shi, Guoliang/I-5414-2012; Zhang, Yuan/P-1011-2014; Guo, Changsheng/K-8064-2012; Guo, Chang-Sheng/K-8064-2012; Wang, Yuqiu/JRY-5084-2023; Xu, Jian/I-7019-2012	Feng, Yinchang/0000-0002-6014-5258; Guo, Changsheng/0000-0002-3598-325X; Xu, Jian/0000-0001-5287-1009													1439-0108	1614-7480				JUN	2012	12	6					933	941		10.1007/s11368-012-0526-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-012-0526-9													WOS:000304160900012
J	Gat, JR; Alrey, PL				Gat, Joel R.; Alrey, Peter L.			Stable water isotopes in the atmosphere/biosphere/lithosphere interface: Scaling-up from the local to continental scale, under humid and dry conditions	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												At and near the land surface, the precipitation is partitioned into fluxes of percolation, surface runoff and evapo-transpiration. These processes are accompanied by changes in the stable isotopic composition, primarily the result of isotopic fractionation between the water molecules associated with the partial evaporation from open surface and soilwaters. Following such an evaporative process the residual water is marked by an enrichment of the heavy isotopes and decrease of the d-excess parameter, with the complementary opposite effect on the atmospheric moisture. Transpiration, on the other hand, returns the water essentially unfractionated to the atmosphere. This results in a change of the amount of water which is unaccompanied by a change in the isotopic composition and which has been widely used to distinguish between the transpiration and evaporation fluxes. An understanding of the isotopic composition also requires consideration of a possible selection between precipitation events of different isotopic composition on a short term and seasonal basis. With increasing geographic scale, any local effect of the evaporative isotopic signature can be attenuated in the runoff under an exorheic regime by subsequent rainout and the accumulation of additional surface or sub-surface discharges that have not suffered an evaporative water loss; however, since rainout usually occurs under close to equilibrium conditions, the integrated isotope signature of all evaporation processes is preserved in the atmospheric moisture. In the more and environment with its endorheic runoff regime, more and more of the surface water is lost by evaporation as the scale of the basin increases, often terminating in highly saline lakes. In contrast to the situation described above, the signature of the d-excess is thus accentuated in the runoff whereas its contribution to the atmospheric moisture diminishes as a larger and larger fraction of the surface water is being evaporated.

Recently, Pergau Lake was gazette as state park and any activities related to fishery and agricultural were not allowed in the park. Subsequently, the nearby lake community was affected as many of them earn a living by carrying fisheries activity in the lake especially harvesting Asian clam. 10 sampling sites were selected in the lake to monitor water quality and Asian clam distribution. Water parameters data were also subjected to cluster analysis by using Ward's method with squared Euclidean distances as a measure of similarity and a dendrogram was successfully generated. The water quality of the lake is under good condition and suitable to carry fishery activities by referred to Malaysia National Water Quality Standards (NWQS). The dendrogram revealed that the sampling sites can be divided into 2 clusters where Location 1 alone in its own cluster. Another cluster possesses 2 sub-clusters where Location 2 and 3 shared similar sub cluster. Another sub-cluster has two groups namely Location 5, 6 and 8 in one group whereas Location 4, 7, 9 and 10 shared similar group. The findings of the present study showed most of sampled Asian clam in Pergau Lake was semi mature indicating highly exploitation of Asian clam in the Lake. Furthermore, there were no correlation was detected between the population of Asian clam and water quality of the lake. Hence, we suggest that seasonal harvesting Asian clam should be implemented in order to conserve the population of Asian clam in the lake at the mean time the community to continue earn a living through carrying fishery activities in the lake.

Water samples were collected every week during the 2005 rice planting season in Kagoshima Prefecture and stations were established in Amori River, Sudo River, Nagaida River (that drains into the bigger Kotsuki River), rice paddy drainage canal, and wastewater reservoir (that collects effluents from rice paddy fields). Of the 14 target pesticides examined, a total of 11 were detected in all stations. Mefenacet, fenobucarb, and flutolanil were the three pesticides with the highest maximum concentrations and were also detected frequently. Analysis of temporal variations of pesticides showed that herbicides had relatively higher concentrations in the earlier stages of the rice planting season, while insecticides and fungicides had relatively higher concentrations at the later stages. There was no significant difference among stations with regards to the temporal patterns of the top three pesticides. The calculated toxic units were less than 1 in all stations, implying low or negligible environmental risk of pesticides detected to freshwater organisms.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2010	160	1-4					371	383		10.1007/s10661-008-0701-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0701-z								19089593					WOS:000272615400030

Upwelling couples chemical and biological dynamics across the littoral and pelagic zones of Lake Tanganyika, East Africa	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the effects of upwelling on nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics in the pelagic and littoral zones of Lake Tanganyika near Kigoma, Tanzania. During the dry season of 2004, a rise in the thermocline and sudden drop in surface water temperatures indicated a substantial upwelling event. Increases in concentrations of nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus, and silica in the surface waters occurred simultaneously after the temperature drop. Within days, chlorophyll a concentrations increased and remained elevated, while inorganic nutrient concentrations returned to preupwelling levels and organic nutrient concentrations peaked. We observed parallel temporal patterns of water temperature, nutrient concentrations, and phytoplankton chlorophyll in both the pelagic and the littoral zones, demonstrating that upwelling strongly affects the nearshore ecosystem as well as the pelagic zone. Concurrent records from 12 littoral sites indicated spatial variation in the timing, magnitude, and biological response to upwelling. There was no discernable latitudinal pattern in the timing of upwelling, suggesting that mixing did not result from a progressive wave. Our monitoring, as well as other multiyear studies, suggests that dry-season upwelling occurs during most years in northern Lake Tanganyika. The observed sensitivity of littoral nutrients and phytoplankton to upwelling suggests that reductions in upwelling due to global climate change could strongly affect the dynamics of the spectacular nearshore ecosystem of Lake Tanganyika, as has been proposed for the pelagic zone.

Lake Michigan Bythotrephes prey consumption estimates for 1994-2003 using a temperature and size corrected bioenergetic model	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Bythotrephes were collected on a regular basis at a 110 m deep reference station in Lake Michigan over a 10-year period 1994-2003. The measured population structure in conjunction with an updated bioenergetic model was used to estimate daily predation demands by Bythotrephes on the zooplankton community. The bioenergetic model incorporated the effect of temperature on growth and respiration and used a scalable size structure to adjust for a dynamic range in size across the season. A general linear model was developed to apply the bioenergetic results to routinely collected field data for estimating predation needs. Daily population consumption needs were estimated to be approximately equal to Bythotrephes standing biomass but varied as a function of water temperature and percent instar composition. At a temperature of 18 degrees C the predation needs of the population were equal to the population biomass. At warmer temperatures (22-24 degrees C) the daily needs were up to 35% above the population biomass. Within and across years the population was variable, while trend lines from the long-term data indicated biomass and predation needs had an initial peak in mid-August followed by a plateau period with a seasonal high peak mid-October. A decrease in the midseason long-term average size structure suggests that Bythotrephes may experience prey limitation during this time period of the year. Over the course of the 10-year period population cycles and peak biomass were fairly stable with no indication of a change in predation needs. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Despite several reports from Africa, no data were previously available about its dynamics or toxic potential there. We therefore carried out a 1-year survey of the dynamics of C. raciborskii in the main water reservoir in Senegal, Lake Guiers. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii never formed a bloom in this lake during the period studied, but was dominant during the dry season. The only observed bloom-forming species was a diatom, Fragilaria sp., which displayed a seasonal pattern contrary to that exhibited by C. raciborskii. Principal component analysis applied to environmental and phytoplankton data showed that high C. raciborskii biomasses were mainly related to high temperature and water column stability. Tests for C. raciborskii species-related toxicity and/or toxin synthesis were performed on 21 isolated clones. All the strains isolated tested negative in mouse toxicity bioassays, toxin analysis (MS/MS) and tests for known cylindrospermopsin genes (ps, pks). The limited number of isolates studied, and the occurrence of toxic and nontoxic clones in natural cyanobacterial populations, mean that we cannot conclude that there is no C. raciborskii-associated health risk in this drinking water reservoir.					; Bernard, Cecile/AAE-4242-2022	Bernard, Cecile/0000-0001-7032-3989; Gugger, Muriel/0000-0001-6728-1976; Rusconi, Filippo Matteo/0000-0003-1822-0397													0168-6496					SEP	2006	57	3					355	366		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00141.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00141.x								16907750					WOS:000239636200002

However, recent studies have reported increasing threats to wetlands both environmental and human which threaten the provision and acquisition of several wetland benefits. Though there is recognition of the value of wetlands, in most local communities in Uganda; especially around the Lake Wamala region in Mityana district, there is still limited knowledge and research on the benefits of wetlands and the level of threat thus affecting wetland governance. This research addresses this gap by using participatory research to create a baseline inventory that could be used by wetland managers to identify the main wetlands threats to inform policy on how to develop participatory actions and local area-based management practices. The study was conducted in 14 sub-counties and a sample of 105 wetlands along the wetlands of Lake Wamala and River Mayanja wetlands system in Mityana District was captured. Study findings revealed increased human threats to wetlands especially in the River Mayanja seasonal wetlands zone. The increased effects of environmental threats such as climate change are also altering permanent wetlands along Lake Wamala. Our developed inventory based on local participants' perspectives revealed that since the level of damage to wetlands in Mityana especially the permanent wetlands is relatively low, a focus on developing new mapping, and a decentralized approach to wetland management that focuses on capacity building, development of wetlands action plans, increased support to local wetland authorities, and a system thinking approach in wetland threat identification and management could help in the regeneration of most wetlands zones.																				2731-9431				MAR 12	2024	2	1							18	10.1007/s44274-024-00041-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s44274-024-00041-5													WOS:001594733400001

During the sedimentary period of the Eocene Ek(1)-Es-4x formations, because of the frequent alternation between dry and wet climates in the arid climatic background and the gentle paleogeomorphology, the lake level and salinity of the Early Eocene Dongying depression frequently and rapidly increased and decreased, which is referred to as a high-frequency oscillatory lake. The sedimentation and distribution of sediments in this high-frequency oscillatory lake basin were controlled by the frequently alternating dry-wet climates. During periods with relatively wet climate, the seasonal floods and unstable rivers led to the formation of over-flooding lake deltas in the gentle slope belt, and fine-grained clastic sediments, with minor thin layers of gypsum-salt rocks in the sag belt. During the relatively arid climatic periods, sedimentation occurred mainly in the limited area of the sag belt with thick gypsum-salt rocks. Because of the impact of the salinity stratification of the lake water, these gypsum-salt rocks exhibit annular structural features. A sedimentary cycle of the oscillatory lake began with isochronous flood channels and ended with relatively thick gypsum rocks and salt rocks. The thickness of one oscillatory cycle is generally 4-20 m. The superposition of multiple sedimentary cycles of the oscillatory lake constitutes the overall vertical filling sequence of the high-frequency oscillatory lake basin.

Environmental factors affecting the balance of autotrophs versus heterotrophs in the microbial food web of temporary ponds	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relative abundance of autotrophic (A) and heterotrophic (H) organisms in the microbial food web of temporary ponds and its relationship to environmental variables were analysed. Four localities (43 temporary ponds) were selected for study. They were located in unaltered, protected basins without intensive agriculture or strong human pressure. Because the supply of allochthonous organic matter is expected to be higher than inorganic nutrient inputs in temporary ponds, we hypothesized that the microbial food web in these unaltered basins was dominated by heterotrophic organisms. Our results showed that the log A:H biomass ratio (A/H) was always negative, indicating strong dominance by heterotrophic organisms in these ponds. Moreover, A/H was negatively related to DOC concentrations, but this relationship was weaker in the locality with the highest DOC concentration. No significant relationships were found between A/H and the other environmental variables analysed, namely inorganic nutrients, fulvic acids, chlorophyll-a concentrations, macrophyte biomass or total zooplankton biomass. However, when the different groups of zooplankton were considered separately, A/H correlated negatively with cladoreran biomass and positively with harpacticoid biomass. Thus, temporary ponds differ from deeper ecosystems, in which the greater importance of autochthonous energy inputs leads to microbial food web that is more dominated by autotrophs.

Questions of major concern are: which species produce CYN, which are the seasonal patterns of CYN dynamics and how are they regulated? Therefore, we studied for the first time the seasonal dynamics of particulate and dissolved CYN concentrations, cyanobacterial abundance and environmental factors in two German lakes over 2 years. Total CYN reached maximum concentrations of 0.34 and 1.80 mu g L-1 in Melangsee and Langer See, respectively. In both lakes, maxima of the dissolved CYN fraction occurred later in the season than those of the particulate fraction, and it reached higher concentrations. This indicates that CYN is poorly decomposed and accumulates in the water. The cyanobacterial community in both lakes included several potentially CYN-producing species that did not correlate with CYN concentrations. Significant correlations between the particulate CYN concentrations and species biovolume were only found for Aphanizomenon gracile (r(s) = 0.803) in Langer See indicating that this species is a CYN producer. Different correlations of CYN with abiotic factors in the two lakes indicate the presence of further undetected CYN producers as well as different regulation mechanisms of their dynamics and the variability of CYN.

Dominant bands were sequenced and identified as members of the Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae, green nonsulfur bacteria, and Firmicutes divisions and the Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria subdivisions. The BCC in the lake displayed both vertical and latitudinal variation. Vertical changes in BCC were related to the thermal water column stratification, which influences oxygen and nutrient concentrations. Latitudinal variation was related to upwelling of deep water and increased primary production in the south of the lake. The number of bands per sample increased with bacterial production in the epilimnion of the lake, suggesting a positive diversity-productivity relationship.					; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020; De Wever, Aaike/A-4691-2009	Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Muylaert, Koenraad/0000-0001-9645-4063; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				SEP	2005	71	9					5029	5037		10.1128/AEM.71.9.5029-5037.2005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.9.5029-5037.2005								16151083					WOS:000231897400012
J	Bergman, BG; Bump, JK				Bergman, Brenda Gail; Bump, Joseph K.			Experimental evidence that the ecosystem effects of aquatic herbivory by moose and beaver may be contingent on water body type	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Mammalian herbivores that consume both aquatic and terrestrial vegetation may have important but little understood effects on freshwater ecosystems. We assessed the effects of North American moose (Alces americanus) and/or beaver (Castor canadensis) on aquatic vegetation and abiotic conditions of three types of waterbodies. We established year-round aquatic exclosures and reference plots in glacial lakes, dammed lakes and riverine ponds (n=3 in each case). Within plots, we monitored parameters including dissolved oxygen, light, plant diversity and species-specific plant biomass. The effects of herbivory by beaver and moose appear to be contingent upon abiotic and plant community characteristics. Exposure to herbivory decreased biomass in riverine ponds and dammed lakes but not in glacial lakes and decreased species richness in riverine ponds and glacial lakes but not in dammed lakes. Changes in macrophyte species diversity correlated with exposure to herbivory only in glacial lakes. Disaggregating the effects of herbivory according to abiotic conditions and plant community characteristics revealed outcomes that are not detectable when results are aggregated. In some catchments, the response of the aquatic plant community to beaver and moose herbivory may substantially differ from the response of the surrounding terrestrial plant community. Five of the six waterbodies created by beavers (dammed lakes and riverine ponds) maintained >80% macrophyte cover, despite seasonal reduction in biomass by both moose and beaver. Herbivores appear to cause a short-term reduction in plant biomass in dammed lakes, resulting in greater light availability, without depleting biomass over a number of years.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2015	60	8					1635	1646		10.1111/fwb.12595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12595													WOS:000358017100014

Although this physical process is shown as the most important driver in a number of tropical-subtropical lake systems, information on tropical high-mountain lakes is largely lacking. We therefore studied the phytoplankton community composition and the underlying limnological variables of the atelomictic tropical high-mountain Lake Wonchi (Ethiopia) for 13 months. Nutrient levels indicated oligotrophic conditions with ammonium being the primary nitrogen form. The phytoplankton community comprised 53 taxa distributed in five taxonomic divisions, which could be assigned to 15 codas based on phytoplankton functional group classification. Partial atelomixis and low nutrient concentrations seemed to be key variables in structuring phytoplankton community composition, which was quite stable and characterized by high diversity of heavy, immobile and fast-sinking planktonic desmids of the N (A) codon during mixing followed by diatoms (MP codon). A near-monospecific bloom of Peridinium cinctum (Lo codon) prevailed before the onset of lake turnover in December 2011 with conditions of nutrient depletion, which was later followed by the functional groups F-J during the episode of complete mixing and then replaced by the N (A) codon. Non-metric multidimensional scaling resulted in a 2-dimensional solution, which revealed clear segregation of phytoplankton community to five groups. Mixing regime of the water column, conductivity, total phosphorus, ammonium and zooplankton had significant influence on the observed seasonal pattern.

Polar light regime and piscivory govern diel vertical migrations of planktivorous fish and zooplankton in a subarctic lake	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Seasonal variation in light intensity has strong impacts on invertebrate and vertebrate habitat selection creating trade-offs between foraging gain and risk of death. Diel vertical migration (DVM) has received a particularly interest, but multitrophic level studies in lakes under polar light regime have not been conducted. Here, we examined habitat selection of pelagic zooplankton, planktivores and piscivores in subarctic Lake Muddusjarvi with polymorphic whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)). Seasonal change in light was hypothesized to be the most important abiotic factor inducing DVM, whereas predation was considered as an ultimate biotic factor. During period of mid-night sun in June, no DVM was observed at any trophic level, whereas during normal day and night light in September planktivores and zooplankton migrated. DVM was top-down controlled, where piscivorous brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) used pelagic habitat continuously inducing DVM of its main prey, pelagic whitefish morph, which cascaded to reverse DVM of zooplankton. Top-down control of lower trophic level DVMs by piscivores might be more general pattern in lakes than previously considered.

The drainage basins of these lakes are uninhabited and have not been affected by human activity or wildfires. All of the depth profiles of dissolved Re indicate: higher Re concentrations in the water overlying the sediment than in the porewater; diffusion of Re across the sediment-water interface; a progressive decrease in porewater Re concentrations to reach minimum values of similar to 0.5 pM within a 10-cm sediment depth interval. Modeling of these Re porewater profiles with a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation indicates that Re is removed from porewater within this depth interval. Based oil thermodynamic predictions of Re speciation and of saturation states kind on comparison of these predictions with sulfide porewater profiles, we infer that Re is removed from porewater by precipitation of rheniite (ReS2(s)). The rate constant for the formation of ReS2(s) in sediments is estimated from the modeling exercise to be 0.51 +/- 0.64 x 10(-21) mol cm(-3) s(-1). Accumulation of sedimentary Re shows a strong authigenic component, as in anoxic marine sediments. Sharp increases in solid-phase Re during the last century are attributed to atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Re deriving from coal burning and nearby smelter emissions.

The bacterial community composition was determined by cloning-sequencing of 16S rRNA and by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Despite large hydrogeological differences, in the Sep Reservoir and Pavin Lake the dominant bacteria were from the same taxonomic divisions, particularly Acrinobacteria and Betaproteobacteria. In both ecosystems, these major bacterial divisions showed temporal fluctuations that were much less marked than those occurring at a finer phylogenetic scale. Nutrient availability and mortality factors, the nature of which differed from one lake to another, covaried with the temporal variations in the bacterial community composition at all sampling depths, whereas factors related to seasonal forces (temperature and outflow for Sep Reservoir) seemed to account only for the variation of the hypolimnion bacterial community composition. No seasonal reproducibility in temporal evolution of bacterial community from one year to the next was observed.

J	Hicks, S				Hicks, S			The use of annual arboreal pollen deposition values for delimiting tree-lines in the landscape and exploring models of pollen dispersal	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY					Symposium on Modern Pollen Deposition, Tree-lines and Climate held at the INQUA XV International Congress	AUG 03-11, 1999	DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA					In reconstructing past vegetation by pollen analysis there is an increasing need to quantity plant abundance and to specify the distribution of vegetation units in the landscape. Fundamental to such reconstructions is an understanding of the pollen-vegetation relationship. Monitoring pollen deposition by a standardized method in different vegetation situations provides numerical data for this relationship. Here monitoring is by modified 'Tauber' traps following the standardization of the Pollen Monitoring Programme (PMP). Results are presented for an 18-year period (1982-1999) at ten localities within the latitudinal boreal forest zones of northern Fennoscandia. Particular focus is placed on the tree-lines as these are regarded as climate-sensitive boundaries in the landscape. At an annual temporal resolution, pollen deposition reflects climate, primarily the temperature of the growing season of the year before pollen emission. It is the long-term average pollen deposition which reflects the presence/absence and abundance of trees in the surroundings of the monitoring site, Pollen influx values are given for varying degrees of coverage of Betula, Pinus and Picea. The tree-lines of these three taxa are crossed when pollen influx rises above 500, 500 and 50 grains cm(-2) year(-1) respectively. The comparable pollen influx thresholds for the presence of forest are: 1000, 1500 and 100 grains cm(-2) year(-1) respectively. These numerical values apply to openings in the forest cover of c.l ha. However, inside the forest, pollen deposition values can be some three times higher. These data contribute towards the validation of models of pollen-vegetation relationships and the results enable a more objective interpretation of fossil pollen assemblages from terrestrial deposits in terms of both tree-lines and climate.

Holocene changes in the position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies recorded by long-distance transport of pollen to the Kerguelen Islands	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW) are a vital part of the Southern Hemisphere's coupled oceanatmosphere system and play an important role in the global climate system. The SHW affect the upwelling of carbon-rich deep water and exchange of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere by driving the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. On seasonal to millennial timescales, changes in the strength and position of the SHW are associated with temperature and precipitation changes throughout the extratropical Southern Hemisphere. Understanding the behaviour of the SHW under different background climate states is important for anticipating its future behaviour and remains a subject of ongoing research. Terrestrial paleoclimate records from lake sediments are valuable for reconstructing past atmospheric change and records from the handful of sub-Antarctic islands provide the opportunity to develop datasets to document spatio-temporal patterns of long -term SHW behaviour. Here, we generate palynological, microcharcoal, and sedimentological reconstructions (including CT imagery, mu XRF analysis, magnetic susceptibility, and loss -on -ignition) on lake sediments from the Kerguelen Islands (49S) to constrain variability in Holocene vegetation, climate, and atmospheric circulation (SHW position). Due to the influence of the SHW on the Kerguelen Islands, the influx of long -distance transported (LDT) pollen and microcharcoal from southern Africa serve as proxies for the meridional position of the SHW. In contrast with the stable conditions that prevailed on the Kerguelen Islands over the past 8,600 cal yr BP, our findings reveal a highly dynamic Early Holocene period. Consistent with local palynological evidence of warmer conditions, a high influx of LDT pollen and charcoal from southern Africa suggest that the SHW core belt was located further south of the Kerguelen Islands during this time. Comparison against paleoclimate records from the surrounding region and beyond suggests that the inferred changes might be explained by changes to our planet's interhemispheric thermal gradient, triggered by North Atlantic cooling in response to melting of the last remnants of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.					; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020; Schneider, Tobias/LRV-0133-2024	Zwier, Maaike/0000-0001-7029-7266; van der Bilt, Willem/0000-0003-3157-451X; Bakke, Jostein/0000-0001-6114-0400; Van der Putten, Nathalie/0000-0002-0271-9321; Schneider, Tobias/0000-0002-1593-0273; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				APR 15	2024	330								108595	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108595		MAR 2024											WOS:001203099200001

Response of a low elevation carbonate lake in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) to climatic and human forcings	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The importance of climate change, specifically drought, across the Maya region in the northern Neotropics, remains a topic of lively debate. Part of this discussion hinges on the coherency of response to climatic variability across different archives and proxies. In this paper we present a 6600-year palaeolimnological record from Yaal Chac, a carbonate lake (known locally as a cenote) in the northern lowlands of the Yucatan Peninsula, < 2 km from the location of the previously published Aguada X'Caamal record. The Yaal Chac sequence has been analysed for loss-on-ignition (L01), stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta C-13) and elemental analysis using mu XRF, complemented by some mineralogical, charcoal and pigment data. Mid Holocene sediments, predating evidence of human impact, are carbonate dominated and finely laminated. delta O-18 values are positive (>2 parts per thousand), but show no covariation with delta C-13. A major transition occurs at ca. 4360 cal yr BP, with a change to generally more organic sediments and increased variability in all proxies. Although direct evidence for anthropogenic activity in the Yaal Chac catchment is limited, it seems feasible that human impact was affecting the system. Comparison with other records from the Northern Maya lowlands and the wider region shows little coherence in the mid Holocene, when Yaal Chac seems to have been quite stable, but possibly responsive to increased climatic seasonality, driving the production of seasonal laminae. In the late Holocene, when the climate was generally more variable, there is more coherence between Yaal Chac and other regional records, including the so called Pan Caribbean Dry Period (3500-2500 cal yr BP) and the droughts of the late Pre-Classic period (1800-1600 cal yr BP). The Yaal Chac record shows no evidence of drought at the time of either the Maya 'hiatus' or the Maya 'collapse' of the Terminal Classic, but does record drying from the 14th to 19th centuries CE, in keeping with other proxy and historical records. This new record from Yaal Chac highlights the spatial variability of responses to climate forcings and the importance of recognising individual system sensitivity. (C) 2022 The Authors.

The local government has proposed a dam downstream of the lake to control the declining trend. The construction of the lake level control structure could affect the migration of some aquatic animals, including this endangered porpoise specie. A two dimensional (2D) diffusion model was developed to assess the movements of porpoises in Poyang Lake with the dam in place. This 2D model was coupled with a hydrodynamic model to evaluate the passage efficiency of the proposed bypass system of the planned dam. The diffusion model was based on the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. In this model porpoises were treated as particles which have flow velocity preference and share similar modes of mechanics with porpoises. The model was built on the Eulerian framework so that it can be well coupled with the general hydrodynamic model. The porpoise's distribution and movements are represented by particle diffusion. What's more, this model is suitable for modeling distributions of other aquatic species, such as fish, due to its sophisticated theoretical principles. The results indicated that the passage efficiency of the bypass system is acceptable whether in the dry or wet seasons. We also applied the model to the entire Poyang Lake to predict the possible habitats for the porpoises. The control equation of the model will be complemented with other source terms, i.e., water temperature, water quality, and water depth to consider their future impacts from this development.

The Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) approach was tested as a tool to monitor the ecotoxic restoration of Lake Geneva for herbicides from 1999 to 2011. We conducted monthly assessments in 1999 and in 2011 for the tolerance of the phytoplankton communities to two herbicides (atrazine and copper), using PICT bioassays. The taxonomical composition of the communities was determined on the same collecting dates. The herbicide concentration decrease during the 12 years significantly influenced the composition of communities. The PICT monitoring indicated that a significant tolerance decrease in the community to both herbicides accompanied the herbicide concentration decrease. PICT measurements for atrazine and copper also changed at the intra-annual level. These variations were mainly due to community composition shifts linked to seasonal phosphorus and temperature changes. PICT monitoring on a seasonal basis is required to monitor the mean tolerance of communities. PICT appeared to be a powerful tool that reflected the toxic effects on environmental communities and to monitor ecotoxic ecosystem restoration.

Bacterial community response to changes in a tri-trophic cascade during a whole-lake fish manipulation	ECOLOGY												Microbial communities play a key role in biogeochemical processes by degrading organic material and recycling nutrients, but can also be important food sources for upper trophic levels. Trophic cascades might modify microbial communities either directly via grazing or indirectly by inducing changes in other biotic or in abiotic factors (e.g., nutrients). We studied the effects of a tri-trophic cascade on microbial communities during a whole-lake manipulation in which European perch (Perca fluviatilis) were added to a naturally fishless lake divided experimentally into two basins. We measured environmental parameters (oxygen, temperature, and nutrients) and zooplankton biomass and studied the changes in the bacterial community using next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and cell counting. Introduction of fish reduced the biomass of zooplankton, mainly Daphnia, which partly altered the bacterial community composition and affected the bacterial cell abundances. However, the microbial community composition was mainly governed by stratification patterns and associated vertical oxygen concentration. Slowly growing green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobium) dominated the anoxic water layers together with bacteria of the candidate division OD1. We conclude that alterations in trophic interactions can affect microbial abundance, but that abiotic factors seem to be more significant controls of microbial community composition in sheltered boreal lakes.

Metal exposure was evaluated on the basis of the free ambient Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+ concentrations, as estimated from chemical equilibrium simulations using the ambient water chemistry data. Based on regression analyses, lake water Ca2+ and H+ did not significantly influence the steady-state metal concentrations in various body parts of yellow perch. Cadmium concentrations were significantly higher in the gastrointestinal tract than in the gills, suggesting that uptake of this metal from food is more important than uptake from water. Variations in the contribution of each organ to the total Cd and Cu burdens revealed a possible dysfunction in liver excreting capacities in the fish from the most highly contaminated lakes. Additionally, measurements on yellow perch from 0 to 10 years old (N = 81) collected from a single lake suggest that Cd concentrations in some organs increase with fish age, which we interpret to be linked to changes in fish growth rate with age.

Due to the limitations of observation methods, the current research is still very insufficient. To solve the above problems and clarify the main influencing factors of CO2 emission in karst water, this study selected Dalongdong (DLD) Reservoir, located in the typical karst peak and valley area in southwest China, to carry out a multi-parameter high-frequency monitoring study from January to December 2021, and used the thin boundary model method to estimate the CO2 flux across the water-air interface (CF). The average annual flux of DLD reservoir is 84.48 mmol<middle dot>(m(2)<middle dot>h)(-1), which represents a CO2 source overall. However, during the stratification period in August, there is a transient carbon sink due to negative CO2 emission. The alteration of thermal stratification in water is crucial in regulating the seasonal variation of CF. Meanwhile, the diurnal variation is significantly influenced by changes in hydrochemical parameters during the thermal stratification stage. Compared to low wind speeds (<3 m/s), high wind speeds (>= 3 m/s) have a greater impact on the CO2 flux. Furthermore, high-frequency continuous data revealed that the reservoir triggered a CO2 pulse emission during the turnover process, primarily at night, leading to unusually high CO2 flux values. It is of great significance to monitor and reveal the process, flux, and control factors of CO2 flux in land water at a high-frequency strategy. They will help improve the accuracy of regional or watershed carbon budgets and clarify the role of global land water in the global carbon budget.

We hypothesized that mature males released sex pheromones to attract mature females to their nests. To develop an effective method for controlling the population in a lake of northern Japan, we studied the efficacy of using bile collected from mature males with the bioactive function to attract mature females. A trap was devised to evaluate the attraction of sample solutions from males and to test practical uses of the pheromone. In the spawning season, when bile from reproductive males (RB) was introduced into the traps, female catches in the trap were significantly higher than when bile from non-reproductive males (NRB) or controls were used. In the non-spawning season, the female largemouth bass did not show any preference for RB. Other fish species did not show any preference for RB in both the spawning and non-spawning season. This study shows that RB contains a sex pheromone that attracts mature females, suggesting that pheromone traps could possibly be used to control largemouth bass populations.

In 2009, a study was established to measure factors affecting lake use by breeding scoters, to inform conservation measures. That study, published inAquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems(AQC) in 2016, showed that lakes used by scoters had relatively more shallow water and large invertebrates. Furthermore, lakes with abundant large invertebrates had relatively few brown troutSalmo trutta. These results probably reflect the importance of foraging habitat (shallow water), prey abundance (large invertebrates), and competition for prey (trout abundance) in influencing scoter lake use. To develop this study, additional research, and scoter conservation measures, we formed a long-term partnership, comprising nature conservation non-governmental organizations, statutory agencies, fisheries managers and the regional hydropower company. The partnership meets regularly to coordinate and review research and develop conservation measures, building on the earlier lake-use study. At key scoter lakes managed for hydropower, the partnership negotiated a revised water level management regime, favouring shallow water availability in the breeding season. This regime was informed by additional research, showing the value of certain islands for nesting scoters, and water level requirements to maintain these as islands. In a different key scoter area - an extensive near-natural peatland where recreational angling takes place - the partnership established a trial of increased brown trout angling, with increased fish removal, to determine whether this would increase invertebrate prey abundance and benefit breeding scoters. Both conservation interventions are currently being evaluated by detailed monitoring. Overall, the earlier study published in AQC, was important in strengthening and informing our researcher-practitioner partnership, as we collaborated within an adaptive management framework to reverse scoter declines. Long-term interdisciplinary partnerships are likely to have an important role to play in general, for the successful conservation of aquatic biodiversity. 1.2.3.4.5.

Freshwater turtle bycatch research supports science-based fisheries management	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Although it is sometimes difficult for researchers to ensure that their work is used by resource managers to make informed decisions, an example where this knowledge-action gap has been breached is in research published inAquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems(AQC) - among other journals - that has assisted fisheries managers in identifying strategies for reducing freshwater turtle bycatch in commercial hoop net fisheries in Ontario, Canada. Research published in AQC has provided evidence towards a simple and effective method for preventing turtle bycatch mortality in hoop nets, which could be adopted by the fishers. Other research published in AQC evaluated the effect of bycatch mortality on the probability of persistence of turtle populations with population viability analyses, and outlined the need to minimize bycatch mortality to prevent local extirpation. Nine other papers have been published on freshwater turtle bycatch in Ontario, furthering our knowledge on this issue including seasonality and temperature effects on catches, other net modifications, post-release effects and assisted recovery, and the perspectives of fishers. The research results were presented to local resource managers with further discussions involving industry and stakeholders to minimize turtle bycatch mortality. Over several years, researchers have provided information to resource managers; however, when an incident of high turtle mortality caught the public eye, the research was readily available and changes in regulations were quick to occur. Reasonably good communication among researchers, resource managers, industry, stakeholders, and the broader public allowed the rapid implementation of regulations to mitigate freshwater turtle bycatch mortality and bridged the knowledge-action gap between researchers and resource managers. Both articles published in AQC had practical conservation impacts and were influential in providing local resource managers with feasible solutions, and the impetus to change regulations. These impacts extended to other jurisdictions and their monitoring programmes, where methods to reduce turtle bycatch mortality were also implemented.					; Blouin-Demers, Gabriel/GRS-0626-2022; Nguyen, Vivian/HII-3401-2022; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Lake, Colin/0000-0002-2287-197X; Larocque, Sarah/0000-0002-2088-4988; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													1052-7613	1099-0755				SEP	2020	30	9			SI		1783	1790		10.1002/aqc.3404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3404													WOS:000570237100013

Stable isotope patterns in lake food webs reflect productivity gradients	ECOSPHERE												Stable isotopes C-13 and N-15 are often used in lake ecosystems to assess energy sources and trophic positions, respectively. However, delta C-13 and delta N-15 are also influenced by internal biogeochemical processes in epilimnetic and hypolimnetic habitats in lakes, but the extent to which biogeochemical processing mediates isotope values between these two habitats, and whether these patterns are influenced by lake productivity is not known. We sampled delta C-13 and delta N-15 in epilimnetic mussels, Chaoborus, cisco (Coregonus artedi), and seston and zooplankton in the epilimnia and hypolimnia of 22 Minnesota (USA) lakes ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic. We also measured lake temperature-oxygen profiles and light levels to assess factors influencing isotope patterns. isotope samples were baseline-corrected using epilimnetic mussels in each lake (sample-mussel) to control for watershed-level differences in isotope values. Results showed delta C-13 in epilimnetic and hypolimnetic zooplankton, hypolimnetic seston, Chaoborus, and cisco became more depleted in delta C-13 relative to epilimnetic mussels in low-productivity lakes where light penetrated into the hypolimnion, while epilimnetic seston delta C-13 stayed similar to mussel delta C-13 in all lakes. This pattern was likely due to hypolimnetic phytoplankton in Clearwater lakes incorporating more respired CO2, which is depleted in delta C-13, and subsequently passing depleted delta C-13 values up the food chain. Results also showed habitat differences in delta N-15 with epilimnetic and hypolimnetic zooplankton, hypolimnetic seston, Chaoborus, and cisco becoming more enriched relative to epilimnetic mussels in low-productivity lakes with higher O-2 levels in the hypolimnion, while epilimnetic seston delta N-15 remained similar to mussel values. The delta N-15 pattern is consistent with the idea that denitrification and microbial degradation enriched hypolimnetic seston relative to epilimnetic seston in low nutrient lakes, while enhanced epilimnetic primary production enriched epilimnetic delta N-15 seston relative to hypolimnetic seston in high nutrient lakes. Our results indicate isotopic differences between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic organisms that change along productivity gradients and suggest that microbial processes and the light regime are important drivers.					; Grow, Ryan/AAR-4441-2021; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013	Grow, Ryan/0000-0002-9716-8779; 													2150-8925					SEP	2020	11	9							e03244	10.1002/ecs2.3244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3244													WOS:000576968700022

SURVIVAL OF PIPING PLOVER (CHARADRIUS MELODUS) CHICKS IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION	AUK												The Great Lakes population of Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) is federally endangered, numbering between 17 and 71 pairs during 1986-2011. Recovery efforts are diverse, but a major management focus is reduction of predation on eggs and chicks. We evaluated rates and potential causes of mortality for 2,143 chicks from 597 broods at 31 separate breeding sites during 1992-2011. Average daily survival rates of chicks increased from hatch until fledging (similar to 23 days of age), but this pattern exhibited substantial variation among breeding sites and years, so we included breeding sites and years as random effects in our models. Average (+/- SE) survival to fledging age was 0.556 +/- 0.011. Survival increased with year (1992-2011) and declined with hatching date (28 May-25 July), with seasonal declines becoming more pronounced in recent years. Survival of chicks was reduced by heavy rain (>1 cm) during the first 3 days of life, but <10% of broods were affected. Although site effects were pronounced in the random effects analysis, only one covariate related to nest locations was important: chick survival decreased with proximity of nests to trees. Because broods that hatched earlier in the season had higher survival, management efforts should be focused on finding and protecting nests of early breeding pairs. In addition, because some sites have lower chick survival than others, identifying and ameliorating factors that contribute to low fledging success will likely boost productivity at these sites.

The heavy metals concentration in P. australis tissue can be several ten to several thousand times higher than those in the surrounding water. In this study, the content of heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Sr and V) in sediment, water and different organs of Phragmites australis collected from Lake Skadar, Montenegro, during different seasons of the year 2011, were examined. The highest concentrations of Sr were found in the leaves, while the other studied metals showed their highest concentrations in the roots. Thus, P. australis is considered a root bioaccumulation species. For most metals, the concentrations in the roots and stems increased over time until the end of the growing season and then decreased, while the concentrations in the leaves increased even after the growing season of the plant. If P. australis is used for phytoremediation purposes, then it should be harvested after the growing season because then the concentrations of metals in the above-ground parts are maximal.

Bacterial abundance varied from 1.5 x 10(5) to 12.3 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) and exhibited a seasonal pattern that correlated with water temperature and phytoplankton abundance rather than nutrient. This indicated that temperature had a strong effect on bacterial abundance in cold and oligotrophic Lake Namco. Bacterial diversity and community compositions varied in different months. Bacterial community structure changes coincide with the variations of dissolved organic carbon and total nitrogen contents. The three best-represented bacterial groups in libraries, the Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Beta-proteobacteria, had distinct temporal niches and dominated the bacterial communities in January, May, and June, respectively. Ice cover and nutrient appeared to be of important factors in structuring the seasonal variation of bacterial community composition in Lake Namco.

Influence of salinity on the size at maturity for fish species reproducing in contrasting West African estuaries	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The influence of salinity on life-history traits was tested using two adjoining West African estuaries: the Gambia with a 'normal' salinity gradient (salinity always < 40 and decreasing from the mouth upstream) and the Sine Saloum (Senegal) with an inverse gradient (from 35 at the estuary mouth up to > 130 in the upper reaches). The breeding seasons and subsequent fork length (L-F) at first maturity (L-F50) were estimated for different fish species reproducing both in the Sine Saloum and in the Gambia River estuaries using a database built from experimental fish samplings between 1990 and 2003 with a purse seine (30 locations in the Sine Saloum and 44 in the Gambia). The database contained 30553 individuals belonging to 60 different species among which only 20 species reproduced in both estuaries. The breeding seasons peaked just before, or at the beginning of the rainy season (June to July), and there were almost no sexually mature fishes at the beginning of the dry season (November to December). Patterns of differences between L-F50 of the two estuaries did not follow a general trend (positive or negative), but varied in the same way for females and males of a given species. The L-F50 was only systematically reduced with increasing salinity in species living in high-salinity waters (> 70). For species living below 70, differences in sizes at first maturity between the two estuaries did not show any clear relationship with salinity. The smallest mature individual found in an environment was a good indicator of the size at first maturity reached in a particular ecosystem because the trend of the species differences between the two ecosystems generally followed that of the differences in size at maturity.

J	Fytianos, K; Lourantou, A				Fytianos, K; Lourantou, A			Speciation of elements in sediment samples collected at lakes Volvi and Koronia, N. Greece	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												A five-step sequential extraction procedure was applied for the determination of the distribution of seven elements (Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe) in sediment samples collected at two lakes, Volvi and Koronia, located in N. Greece. Samples were taken in two seasons, and the average concentration of the elements was calculated. The accuracy evaluated by comparing total trace metal concentrations with the sum of the five individual fractions proved to be satisfactory. Based on the results determined at one sampling point in Koronia and two sampling points along the lake Volvi, it seems that the two lakes have not yet been polluted. There were no significant changes in the individual seasonal concentrations of elements in this monitoring period. Cd, Pb, Cu and Cr are associated with the oxidizable, carbonates and residual fractions. Zn and Fe are associated with residual and reducible fractions. The metals that we most easily extracted in the samples analysed in both lakes are Ph, Cr, Cd, Cu and also Mn in the case of Koronia lake. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The degree of matching between human-land-water-heat elements directly influences the sustainable development of a region. However, the current evaluation of the matching of human-land-water-heat elements overlooks the influence of elevation factors on the matching results, especially evident in mountainous areas. Taking the Yunnan Plateau with distinctive mountainous features as the research subject, divided into 11 elevation ranges, the Lorenz Gini coefficient, asymmetry coefficient, matching distance, and imbalance index are used to assess the spatial matching and balance of human-land-water-heat elements. A projection tracing model is employed to analyze its water resource carrying capacity. Analyses revealed that the Gini coefficient of monthly precipitation from the 1950s to 2022 on the Yunnan Plateau increases with increasing latitude, whereas the correlation with elevation is notably lower. The asymmetry coefficient increases gradually from west to east with change in longitude. The mismatch of the human-land-water-heat system in regions at different elevations is in the order 1800-2000 m > 2000-2200 m > 1400-1600 m > 800 m > other areas. The matching of the human-land-water-heat system in different wet-dry years and seasons also fluctuates with elevation, resulting in serious seasonal drought and water shortage problems in mountainous areas with elevations of 1200-1600, 1800-2000 m, and >2600 m. The spatial equilibrium of temperature and precipitation in regions of different elevations is best, followed by that of cultivated land, while that of the population is the worst. The Gini coefficients for different water cycle processes of precipitation, surface runoff, and regulating storage capacity for water supply continue to increase. Specifically, the Gini coefficient of industrial water supply is the highest, reaching 0.576, and that of agricultural irrigation is the lowest (0.424). Through artificial regulation of lake and reservoir water, seasonal changes in the demand for agricultural irrigation water are offset to achieve a demand-supply balance and matching of land and water resources. The water resource capacity of different elevation ranges is evenly underloaded. However, the potential of the water resource capacity varies obviously with elevation in the order 2000-2200 m < 1800-2000 m < 1600-8000 m < 1400-1600 m < other areas. It appears that the greater the human-land-water-heat system mismatch, the smaller the regional potential of the water resource capacity.

This research delves into the Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) within the Imphal Valley from 2016 to 2021 and assesses their impact on air quality across distinct land cover types. We used Sentinel-1 & 2 data, ALOS PALSAR Digital Elevation Model, and applied Random Forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm for effective land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. Additionally, Sentinel-5P data was utilized to monitor air quality parameters (CO, HCHO, NO2, SO2, Aerosol Index) spanning 2019 to 2021. The overall accuracies for the LULC maps employing a k (k = 3) fold approach for accuracy assessment varied between 88% and 92%, with corresponding Kappa coefficient ranging from 0.85 to 0.90. Noteworthy trends emerged from our analysis, revealing an increase in settlements and horticulture farms and a decline in forested areas and phumdis (floating biomass). Our findings highlight a mean concentration of CO ranging between 0.045 mol/m2 and 0.055 mol/m2 in different land cover types during February and March (2019-2021). Furthermore, we observed maximum mean HCHO, NO2, SO2, and aerosol index concentrations in March. Pollution levels surged during forest fires and shifting agriculture seasons, while aerosol levels declined during the lockdown period. This integrated approach emphasized on the comprehensive analysis of the dynamic interplay between LULCC and air quality in the Imphal Valley. This intricate relationship between LULC changes and air quality dynamics in the Imphal Valley, contribute to our understanding of the environmental dynamics in this ecologically vital region. This research article titled "ML based Hybrid Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical LULC Mapping and change analysis with variations in air quality of the Imphal Valley, North-East India" investigates LULC changes in the Imphal Valley from 2016 to 2021 and their impact on air quality (2019-2021). It employs SAR images, Sentinel 2 satellite images, and topographic features to map LULC using a RF Machine Learning Classifier. The study reveals changes in land cover types and their influence on pollutant concentrations, utilizing Sentinel 5P data for air quality monitoring. The integration of Sentinel data and topographic features enhances the accuracy of the analysis. We mapped land use and land cover from 2016 to 2021 using Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data sets with the Random Forest ML Algorithm of Imphal Valley located in Manipur, India and analyzed air quality parameters There was a significant increase in settlement and a substantial decrease in Phumdis, Vegetation, and Paddy The air quality was found to be adversely affected from January to April (2019, 2020, and 2021) owing to forest fires caused possibly due to shifting cultivation practices					; Shukla, Dericks/AAN-7131-2021	Shukla, Arun/0009-0001-5812-1660; Gupta, Priyanka/0000-0003-1050-2701; 														2333-5084				MAR	2024	11	3							e2023EA003176	10.1029/2023EA003176	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023EA003176													WOS:001187005700001
J	Xu, XL; Zhao, J; Wu, GD; Li, YL; Hou, LL				Xu, Xiuli; Zhao, Jun; Wu, Guangdong; Li, Yunliang; Hou, Lili			Tracing Water Recharge and Transport in the Root-Zone Soil of Different Vegetation Types in the Poyang Lake Floodplain Wetland (China) Using Stable Isotopes	SUSTAINABILITY												Background: root-zone water transport is crucial in the water transformation from precipitation to groundwater, directly influencing soil moisture distribution and resource acquisition for wetland plants. Methods: This study investigated the movement mechanism of root-zone (0-80 cm) soil water in the Poyang Lake wetland, China, during a dry year. Hydrological observation and stable isotopes (delta 18O and delta D) were utilized. Results: The root-zone soil water content was low (2.9-12.6%) at the high site covered by Artemisia capillaris, while it remained high (25.2-30.2%) at the median and low sites covered by Phragmites australis and Carex cinerascens, respectively. The isotopic values of shallow soil water (0-40 cm) in the A. capillaris site followed the seasonal pattern of rainfall isotopes, indicating predominantly rainfall recharge. Rainfall was primarily transported by piston flow, with an infiltration depth of approximately 60 cm. Conversely, depleted water isotopes measured at certain depths in P. australis and C. cinerascens sites closely resembled those of rainfall, suggesting that preferential flow dominated. The average groundwater contribution proportions in root-zone soil water were 65.5% and 57.4% in P. australis and C. cinerascens sites, respectively, while no contribution was detected in A. capillaris site. Conclusions: Preferential flow and groundwater recharge occurred in the P. australis and C. cinerascens sites. They enhance the hydrological connection at the profile scale and are useful for maintaining a favorable root-zone moisture environment for wetland ecosystems in dry years. However, the hydrological connectivity between root-zone soil and groundwater was found to be obstructed in the A. capillaris site. This might be the main reason for vegetation degradation at high elevations in the Poyang Lake wetland.

The weighted mean N2O flux rate was 0.08 mg N m (-aEuro parts per thousand 2) h (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) (ranged from -0.07 to 0.35 mg N m (-aEuro parts per thousand 2) h (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)). The result was relatively high in the scope of N2O fluxes from boreal and temperate lakes. Emergent plant zones (Hippuris vulgaris and Glyceria maxima stands) recorded the highest N2O flux rate (0.11 +/- 0.24 and 0.08 +/- 0.17 mg N m (-aEuro parts per thousand 2) h (-aEuro parts per thousand 1), respectively). Non-vegetated lakeshore recorded the lowest N2O flux (0.03 +/- 0.11 mg N m (-aEuro parts per thousand 2) h (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)), lower than that from the floating mat zone of Carex muliensis (0.05 +/- 0.18 mg N m (-aEuro parts per thousand 2) h (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)), the floating-leaved plant zone of Polygonum amphibium (0.07 +/- 0.11 mg N m (-aEuro parts per thousand 2) h (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)), and the wet meadow (0.07 +/- 0.15 mg N m (-aEuro parts per thousand 2) h (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)). Standing water depths were important factors to explain such spatial variations in N2O fluxes. Significant temporal variations in N2O fluxes were also found. Such temporal variation in N2O flux in the littoral zone may be dependent on the interaction of water regime and thermal conditions, instead of the latter solely. These results showed the importance of the littoral zone of lake, especially the emergent plant zone, as a hotspot of N2O fluxes in such grazing meadows.

Parasitoid fauna of Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni Froggatt (Diptera: Tephritidae) in inland New South Wales, Australia and their potential for use in augmentative biological control	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Augmentative releases of parasitic wasps may improve management of the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni Froggatt, in inland New South Wales (NSW). A survey was conducted from October 2008 to April 2009 to detect the presence of parasitoids of fruit fly. Fruit fly-infested fruits were collected in Wagga Wagga, Cootamundra, Ganmain, Gundagai, Lockhart and Lake Cargelligo on the south-west slopes and plains of NSW and Albury-Wodonga on the NSW-Victorian border. Two species of opiine parasitoids were detected: Diachasmimorpha kraussii (Fullaway) and D. tryoni (Cameron); both species from fruits that also yielded B. tryoni and island fruit fly, Dirioxa pornia (Walker). Nine per cent of fruit samples yielded parasitoids. There were statistically significant differences between fruit type, fruit species, sampling events and towns. Fruit fly parasitoids were most commonly detected in fig (27.2% of samples), followed by stone fruit (11.5%), pome fruit (6.1%), loquat (4.3%) and citrus (2.1%). Parasitoid incidence varied throughout the fruit fly season, peaking in FebruaryMarch 2009 (17.4%). Of the towns surveyed, Cootamundra had the highest incidence of parasitoids (28.8%), followed by Wagga Wagga (9.5%), Gundagai (10.2%) and Lockhart (1.2%), with no parasitoids detected in Albury-Wodonga, Ganmain or Lake Cargelligo. Diachasmimorpha tryoni was detected in all surveys except JanuaryFebruary 2009, during a heatwave. Diachasmimorpha tryoni was most prevalent in NovemberDecember 2008 (5.2%). Diachasmimorpha kraussii was most prevalent in FebruaryMarch 2009 (14.5%), but was not detected in October 2008 or April 2009. Diachasmimorpha tryoni was detected in Wagga Wagga (6.1%) and Cootamundra (1.9%), with D. kraussii detected in Wagga Wagga (9.5%), Cootamundra (26.9%), Gundagai (10.2%) and Lockhart (1.2%). The presence of these parasitoid species in the region suggests they may be suitable for augmentative release in the control of B. tryoni in inland NSW.

Land cover mapping at Alkali Flat and Lake Lucero, White Sands, New Mexico, USA using multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												The goal of this research is to map land cover patterns and to detect changes that occurred at Alkali Flat and lake Lucero, White Sands using multispectral Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Advanced Land Imager (ALL), and hyperspectral Hyperion and Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. The other objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the information dimensionality limits of Landsat 7 ETM+, ASTER, ALI, Hyperion, and AVIRIS data with respect to signal-to-noise and spectral resolution, (2) to determine the spatial distribution and fractional abundances of land cover endmembers, and (3) to check ground correspondence with satellite data. A better understanding of the spatial and spectral resolution of these sensors, optimum spectral bands and their information contents, appropriate image processing methods, spectral signatures of land cover classes, and atmospheric effects are needed to our ability to detect and map minerals from space. Image spectra were validated using samples collected from various localities across Alkali Flat and Lake Lucero. These samples were measured in the laboratory using VNIR-SWIR (0.4-2.5 mu m) spectra and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) method. Dry gypsum deposits, wet gypsum deposits, standing water, green vegetation, and clastic alluvial sediments dominated by mixtures of ferric iron (ferricrete) and calcite were identified in the study area using Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), Pixel Purity Index (PPI), and n-D Visualization. The results of MNF confirm that AVIRIS and Hyperion data have higher information dimensionality thresholds exceeding the number of available bands of Landsat 7 ETM+, ASTER, and ALI data. ASTER and ALI data can be a reasonable alternative to AVIRIS and Hyperion data for the purpose of monitoring land cover, hydrology and sedimentation in the basin. The spectral unmixing analysis and dimensionality eigen analysis between the various datasets helped to uncover the most optimum spatial-spectral-temporal and radiometric-resolution sensor characteristics for remote sensing based on monitoring of seasonal land cover, surface water, groundwater, and alluvial sediment input changes within the basin. The results demonstrated good agreement between ground truth data and XRD analysis of samples, and the results of Matched Filtering (MF) mapping method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Approximately 27% of the pejerrey and 75% of the carachi exceeded the US EPA fish tissue-based water quality criterion level of 0.30 mu g g(-1). Mercury levels of pejerrey increased with fish size, although this relationship was less apparent for the smaller carachi. The pejerrey and carachi are important food fish for local residents. A synoptic sampling of the Rio Ramis - the largest tributary to Lake Titicaca - was conducted in an attempt to determine if mercury releases from artisanal gold mining could be an important source of Hg contamination to Lake Titicaca. Although highly elevated concentrations of Hg and other heavy metals were documented in headwater streams near the mining centers of La Rinconada and Cecilia, the quantity of Hg entering Lake Titicaca that could be attributed to mining in the Ramis watershed was below the quantifiable limit in our July 2002 study. This does not diminish the localized threat to mercury exposure for the artisanal gold miners themselves, as well as their families. Further studies of mercury dynamics in Lake Titicaca are recommended, as well as in the rivers draining into the lake. It is probable that most of the downgradient transport of Hg and other trace metals from the headwater mining centers occurs as suspended sediment during seasonal periods of high-flow.

J	Lynch, JA; Hollis, JL; Hu, FS				Lynch, JA; Hollis, JL; Hu, FS			Climatic and landscape controls of the boreal forest fire regime: Holocene records from Alaska	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. The response of ecosystems to past and future climatic change is difficult to understand due to the uncertainties in the direction and magnitude of changes and the relative importance of interactions between climate and local factors. In boreal ecosystems such interactions may dictate the response to climatic change, but the interaction of climate, vegetation composition and the fire regime remains poorly understood. 2. Sediment cores from lakes in south-central Alaska were analysed for lithology, macrofossils, pollen and charcoal to investigate the relationships between moisture availability, species composition and mean fire return intervals (MFI). 3. Macrofossil and lithological evidence suggests that variations in effective moisture occurred over the past 7000 years and that the regional climate has been wetter during the past c. 3800 years than before. 4. Boreal forests existed in the region throughout the past 7000 years. Picea glauca and Picea mariana were the prevalent forest species around Chokasna Lake, whereas P. glauca and hardwood species (e.g. Betula) co-dominated the landscape around Moose Lake. Picea mariana replaced P. glauca as the dominant Picea species around Chokasna Lake at c. 2000 BP. 5. MFI was > 500 years before 3800 BP, except from 5800 to 5000 BP at Moose Lake and 5400 to 4550 BP at Chokasna Lake, when values were c. 200 years. MFI decreased to c. 200 years during the late-Holocene at both sites and to c. 150 years after 2000 BP at Chokasna Lake. 6. At both sites, fires occurred more frequently under wetter climatic conditions. Our results therefore support other recent studies demonstrating that warmer/drier climatic conditions do not necessarily induce greater fire importance. A combination of increased ignition by lightning strikes and seasonal-moisture variability probably resulted in more frequent fires under wetter conditions.																			0022-0477	1365-2745				JUN	2004	92	3					477	489		10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00879.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00879.x													WOS:000221424600009

Protein content varied from 47.9 to 55.7% for wet season biomass samples and from 39.2 to 40.8% for dry season samples. Dry season samples were characterized by relatively higher carbohydrate values (38.0-41.3%). Higher proportion of amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids were recorded for biomass harvested in wet season. Similarly, higher contents of phytonutrients (pigments) were recorded for wet season biomass samples: chlorophyll a (8.2-10.3 mg g(-1)), phycobiliproteins (104.1-120.7 mg g(-1)), total carotenoids (3.17-4.31 mg g(-1)), and beta-carotene (1.24-1.61 mg g(-1)). The contents of Na and K were higher for a dry season biomass whereas other major (Ca, P, Mg) and trace (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se) minerals were found relatively in higher quantities in a wet season biomass. The nutritional composition of Arthrospira from Lake Chitu was found to be relatively comparable to that found in commercial Arthrospira products in the market. The significance of the findings is discussed in relation to potential sustainable production of Arthrospira biomass from this lake.

Morphological observations led to the identification of D. planctonicum-like filaments in seasonal water samples. In the present study, we successfully isolated these filaments using culture methods, and examined its morphology using light and scanning electron microscopy. The morphology of the D. planctonicum-like species differed from that of typical D. planctonicum; it had thin cylindrical-shaped akinetes, which were narrower towards the ends than at the center. This morphology is firstly described in the genus Dolichospermum. In addition, the akinetes in the filament developed solitarily and were distant from the heterocytes. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences showed that our Dolichospermum clustered with D. planctonicum and D. circinale, which have coiled trichome. However, phylogenetic analysis of the gene encoding rivulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcIA) clearly separated our species from other Dolichospermum, forming a unique Glade. Additionally, structures of D. planctonicum and D. hangangense strains were different type in Box-B and V3 region. These results demonstrated that the new Dolichospermum species was unique in morphology and molecular traits. Therefore, we propose this to be a new species belonging to genus Dolichospermum with the name Dolichospermu in hangangense sp. nov.					; Choi, Hyejeong/HJP-9451-2023; Wang, Pengbin/J-2436-2014; Kim, Joo-Hwan/MXJ-8057-2025	Joo, Jae-Hyoung/0000-0001-5720-8716; Wang, Pengbin/0000-0001-7116-3227; 													1226-2617	2093-0860				JUN	2018	33	2					143	156		10.4490/algae.2018.33.5.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.4490/algae.2018.33.5.2													WOS:000435567300001

Here we tested whether bacterial stoichiometry changes with the trophic status of lakes by assessing the elemental composition of the bacterial-dominated (hereafter microbial) fraction together with that of the dissolved and seston fractions in 11 lakes situated along an elevational gradient. The stoichiometry of these three size-fractions was analyzed during the thermal stratification and mixing periods in composite water samples and in the water layer of the deep chlorophyll-a maximum. In addition, we analyzed the relative abundance of the most common bacterial groups in the lakes. Our results show that the microbial fraction was always enriched in phosphorus compared to the dissolved fraction, irrespectively of the lake trophic status. Further, they indicate that the elemental composition of bacteria in mountain lakes is at least seasonally very dynamic, resulting not only from changes in the nutrient ratios of the resource itself, but probably from changes in the composition of the dominant bacterial taxa too, though at the taxonomic level analyzed, we did not find evidence for this.

Ecology of testate amoebae in a North Carolina pocosin and their potential use as environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators	ECOSCIENCE												Testate amoebae inhabiting Sphagnum peatlands are sensitive indicators of substrate-moisture content. However, ecological data from a range of peatland types is needed to assess their indicator-value in other peatland systems. We examined testate amoeba communities and species-environment relationships at 40 locations within a pocosin of North Carolina. Primary objectives were to provide baseline data on the ecology of testate amoebae in pocosins, compare communities with those of northern peatlands, and assess the potential of using testate amoebae as environmental indicators in these systems. Results indicated that pH, substrate-moisture content, and conductivity were important controls on community composition. Communities that were relatively similar and dissimilar to those of northern peatlands were encountered, and the ecology of species with respect to water-table depth was similar in both peatland types. Cross validation of transfer functions for pH and water-table depth suggests that Pocosin testate amoebae can be used as indicators for these variables. However, water-table depth was poorly inferred from communities at several dry sites characterized by high bulk density. These sites may experience large seasonal or interannual variability in moisture conditions because of differences in peat structure, suggesting that research is needed on the influence of short-term variability in shaping community structure.					; Booth, Robert/G-5563-2010	Booth, Robert/0000-0002-9264-4959; 													1195-6860	2376-7626					2008	15	2					277	289		10.2980/15-2-3111	http://dx.doi.org/10.2980/15-2-3111													WOS:000257412900015

Twenty-two samples were collected in the cool season (February 2010). Twenty-six species belonging to 18 genera were recorded, three of which are new to the Oriental region (Fabaeformiscandona subacuta (Yang, 1982), Ilyocypris monstrifica (Norman, 1862) and Limnocythere stationis Vavra, 1891) and one (Hemicypris ovata Sars, 1903) is a new record for Thailand. The most common species were Strandesia kraepelini (G. W. Muller, 1906) and Physocypria crenulata (Sars, 1903) occurring in 77% and 64% of the sampled localities, respectively. Additionally, males of Tanycypris siamensis Savatenalinton & Martens, 2009 were found and are here described for the first time. This discovery shows that the morphology of the hemipenis and of the Zenker organs of T. siamensis is similar to that of species in the genus Cypricercus. Additional comments on chorology and ecology of several taxa are also given.

J	Takamura, N; Nakagawa, M				Takamura, Noriko; Nakagawa, Megumi			Phytoplankton species abundance in Lake Kasumigaura (Japan) monitored monthly or biweekly since 1978	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												This data paper reports the abundance of phytoplankton species in monthly or biweekly samples collected from May 1978 through March 2010 at two stations on Lake Kasumigaura, a shallow lake that is the second-largest lake in Japan. The data set of quantitatively over several decades is unique among the available published data papers concerning lakes or plankton and continues to be freely available. The monitoring has been performed as a component of the Lake Kasumigaura Long-term Environmental Monitoring program, conducted by the National Institute for Environmental Studies since 1977. The data set details 173 phytoplankton species (or taxa), which can be identified by using an optical microscope and records their abundance. The abundance of each species is expressed in units of volume (mu m(3)) per milliliter of lake water. This approach allows quantitative comparisons among taxa because the cell size of phytoplankton varies by several orders of magnitude among taxa. The phytoplankton data include 39 species (taxa) of Cyanophyta, 67 Chlorophyceae (Chlorophyta), 3 Prasinophyceae (Chlorophyta), 1 Raphidophyceae (Heterokontophyta), 6 Euglenophyceae (Euglenozoa), 4 Dinophyceae (Dinophyta), 38 Bacillariophyceae (Heterokontophyta), 6 Chrysophyceae (Heterokontophyta), 7 Xanthophyceae (Heterokontophyta), 1 Cryptophyceae (Cryptophyta) and 1 Prymnesiophyceae (Haptophyta). The data have been used for ecological and environmental studies and for studies on lake management.																			0912-3814					SEP	2012	27	5					837	837		10.1007/s11284-012-0971-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-012-0971-3													WOS:000308951600001
J	Hastenrath, S; Polzin, D				Hastenrath, Stefan; Polzin, Dierk			Climatic variations in Central America and the Caribbean	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Resuming earlier work, this study explores the circulation mechanisms of rainfall variations in Central America and the Caribbean during 19211986. Regarding interannual variability, correlation analysis shows as favourable for abundant rainfall in the region warm surface waters, low pressure, upward motion, and weak tradewinds on the Atlantic side and over the eastern Pacific enhanced southerlies and a northward displaced intertropical convergence zone. In the course of the twentieth century, the region experienced alternations between protracted and contrastingly extreme regimes of rainfall, from wet 19311938 to dry 19391947 to wet 19501956 to dry 19711978. Changes in circulation patterns from the dry to the wet regimes are in the sense of correlations in interannual variability, pattern changes being broadly inverse in the evolution from the wet to the dry regimes. The alternations between contrasting circulation and rainfall regimes are reflected in changing lake levels. The study exemplifies the information value of a novel circulation data set.

Modelling life cycle and population dynamics of Nostocales (cyanobacteria)	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales found in lakes in temperate regions are generally assumed to benefit from climate change. To predict their future development under varying environmental conditions, we developed a mathematical model that simulates their entire life cycle. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, a tropical species which spread to the northern temperate zone during the last decades, was used as the model organism. We calibrated and validated the model using a 13-year data set on the species' population dynamics gathered in a shallow lake in northern Germany. The predicted values were consistent with the observed data. We used sensitivity studies and Hasse diagrams based on partial order theory to rank the impact of different model parameters on life cycle dynamics. Our results show that the seasonal dynamics of C. raciborskii are mainly determined by the optimum growth temperature of its vegetative cells. The dynamics of pelagic populations in the water and akinete populations (resting stages) in the sediment is highly dependent on lake water temperature and underwater light intensity and, thus, on climatic conditions. Therefore, any future increase in lake water temperature will presumably lead to an increase in the size of C. raciborskii populations in particular and of Nostocales populations in general.

J	Couture, RM; Gobeil, C; Tessier, A				couture, Raoul-Marie; Gobeil, Charles; Tessier, Andre			Chronology of atmospheric deposition of arsenic inferred from reconstructed sedimentary records	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Vertical distributions of As, Fe, and organic C were determined in dated (Pb-210 and Cs-137) sediment cores obtained from two adjacent basins (one perennially oxic and the other seasonally anoxic) of an oligotrophic headwater lake where atmospheric deposition is the only input of anthropogenic As. Despite similar sources in the two basins, the As profiles in the sediments differed markedly. Differences include the following: (i) As concentrations increased sharply upward close to the sediment surface in the perennially oxic basin due to scavenging of upward diffusing As by Fe oxyhydroxides, whereas they decreased in the seasonally anoxic basin where As scavenging by Fe oxyhydroxides did not occur, and (ii) the magnitude and position of major subsurface As maxima differed between the two basins. We applied a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation to porewater As concentration profiles obtained at the two sites to estimate sedimentary As concentrations at the time of deposition as well as subsequent addition or removal of As at various sediment depths. By multiplying As concentrations at the time of deposition by sediment mass accumulation rates, we were able to estimate variations in As fluxes at the sediment surface over the last two centuries. These fluxes were then transformed into atmospheric As deposition fluxes by applying a correction for basin-specific processes using the ratio of expected from atmospheric deposition to measured unsupported Pb-210 inventories at the sampling sites. The resulting chronological profiles of atmospheric fluxes of As deposition are similar in both basins, and are consistent with both the history of specific markers for coal combustion and direct historical measurements of As in dry and wet atmospheric deposition in rural areas of North America. We conclude that the history of As inputs can be reconstructed from As sedimentary records using appropriate corrections for diagenesis and basin-specific processes.

Ditches sediment from depths below 40 cm can accumulate organic matter and total nitrogen (TN). TN is correlated positively to organic matter in reed populated sediment and wild rice populated sediment. This suggests that the main composition of TN is organic nitrogen derived from plant decomposition. A significant negative relationship between TN and pH was found in reed and wild rice sediments. Seasonal harvest of helophyte vegetation is an effective method to remove N and P from wetlands. Organic matter and TN concentrations in water and sediments (0-20 cm) in areas where reeds were removed are lower than non-harvested areas (control). Reeds and wild rice have high uptake ability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). However, the low economic value of these plants will not stimulate voluntary harvest of farmers. Zizania caduciflora Turez Hand-mazt is a kind of vegetable widely cultivated in ditches around the lake. It can also absorb N and P effectively. Thus, large scale cultivation of Z. caduciflora to replace nature plants may improve water quality.																			0018-8158					MAY	2007	581						319	327		10.1007/s10750-006-0512-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0512-6													WOS:000244992800032
J	Tessier, A; Gobeil, C; Laforte, L				Tessier, Andre; Gobeil, Charles; Laforte, Lucie			Reaction rates, depositional history and sources of indium in sediments from Appalachian and Canadian Shield lakes	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Sediment cores were collected at the deepest site of twelve headwater lakes from the Province of Quebec, Canada that receive contaminants only from atmospheric deposition, either directly to the lake surface or indirectly from the watershed. Several of the lakes are located within relatively short distance (<40 km) and others at more than 200 km from potential sources of contamination. The sediments were dated and analyzed for In and other elements including Fe, Mn, Al and organic C. Fe-rich authigenic material was collected on Teflon sheets inserted vertically into the sediments at the only study site whose hypolimnion remains perennially oxic. Porewater samples collected at the coring site of four of the lakes were also analyzed for In and other solutes including sulfide, sulfate, Fe, Mn, inorganic and organic C and major ions. The porewater In profiles display concentration gradients at or below the sediment-water interface. Modeling these profiles with a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation assuming steady state allows definition of depth intervals (zones) where In is either released to or removed from porewater and quantification of net In reactions rates in each zone. The position of the In consumption zones, the shape of the vertical profiles of dissolved In, sulfide and iron, as well as thermodynamic calculations of saturation states collectively suggest that In(OH)(3(s)) and In2S3(s) do not precipitate in the sediments and that adsorption of In onto sedimentary FeS(s) does not occur. However, similarities in the In and Fe porewater profiles, and the presence of In in the authigenic Fe-rich solids, reveal that part of the In becomes associated with authigenic Fe oxyhydroxides in the perennially oxic lake and is coupled to the Fe redox cycling. Comparison of the In/C-org and In/Fe molar ratios in the authigenic Fe-rich material and in surface sediments (0-0.5 cm) of this lake suggests that most non-lithogenic In was bound to humic substances. From the magnitude of the net In reaction rates, we infer that the post-depositional redistribution of this element is quantitatively not important and that the In sedimentary record represents accurately In deposition at the sampling sites. Reconstructed chronologies of the anthropogenic In deposition and comparison of In inventories among lakes point to non-ferrous metal smelters as a past significant source of atmospheric In contamination and to a significant reduction of industrial In emissions into the North American atmosphere in recent decades.

To evaluate carbon sources that support fish growth, we enriched a 26 ha lake with inorganic 13C. This labeled the autochthonous primary production and allowed us to determine the extent to which invertebrates in fish diets were supported by this autochthonous carbon. Fish autochthony was defined as the proportion ranging from 0 to 1 of fish growth derived from aquatic primary production. This proportion was calculated using the weighted average of each diet taxa's contribution to fish growth along with the autochthony of diet taxa estimated with dynamic models of delta 13C time series. Age 0 bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) had the highest autochthony (0.56, 0.57, respectively) because of greater use of zooplankton that were highly dependent on phytoplankton. Older fishes (age 1 and above) of all species had similar estimates of autochthony (mean=0.47 standard deviation=0.04) derived from feeding on either benthic invertebrates or other fishes. Proportional contribution of terrestrial prey (primarily terrestrial beetles) to fish growth was highest for bluegill (0.07-0.22) and substantially lower (< 0.04) for largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and yellow perch. Across species and ages 45% of fish growth could not be attributed to terrestrial prey items or current autochthonous primary production. This residual detrital carbon source is a mixture of allochthonous material and autochthonous material derived from primary production prior to the 13C addition. Fish growth and production in the study lake were not tightly coupled to the current season's primary production. Nearly half of the organic carbon supporting fish growth came from prior autochthonous primary production or allochthonous sources.

J	Matthews, B; Mazumder, A				Matthews, B; Mazumder, A			Temporal variation in body composition (C:N) helps explain seasonal patterns of zooplankton δ13C	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The stable carbon isotope ratio delta(13)C is a useful tracer of energy flow in lake food webs, and the zooplankton signature is commonly used to establish a baseline for the pelagic habitat. However, sources of temporal variability in the delta(13)C of different zooplankton taxa are rarely considered. 2. Here, we investigate to what extent temporal variation in the delta(13)C of particulate organic matter (POM) (<41 mum) and the C : N of zooplankton can explain the temporal variability in delta(13)C of freshwater zooplankton. We compare temporal patterns of delta(13)C and C : N for Daphnia, Hesperodiaptomus franciscanus and Leptodiaptomus tyrelli over a 6-month period at four sites in two oligotrophic lakes. 3. In all three taxa, seasonal variation in zooplankton C : N explained more of the variation in zooplankton delta(13)C than did the delta(13)C of POM. This suggests that variation in the lipid content of zooplankton can strongly influence temporal variation of delta(13)C in zooplankton. 4. Using these data, we evaluate procedures that estimate the delta(13)C of only the non-lipid component of zooplankton. If zooplankton lipids are primarily dietary in origin, than extracting lipids or 'normalising'delta(13)C based on C : N will exclude a major dietary source, and therefore may be inappropriate. 5. We conclude that temporal variation in body composition (C : N) of zooplankton can significantly influence the temporal variation of zooplankton delta(13)C signatures.

Periodic insect outbreaks affect the growth trajectory of trees, making it difficult to quantify the climate signal in growth dynamics at scales longer than a year. We studied climate-driven growth trends and the influence of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) outbreaks on these trends by analyzing the basal area increment (BAI) of 2058 trees of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Thuja occidentalis L., Populus tremuloides Michx., and Betula papyrifera Marsh, which co-occurs in the boreal mixedwood forests of western Quebec. We used a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to analyze species-specific trends in BAI dynamics from 1967 to 1991. The model relied on tree size, cambial age, degree of spruce budworm defoliation, and seasonal climatic variables. Overall, we observed a decreasing growth rate of the spruce budworm host species, A. balsamea and P. glauca between 1967 and 1991, and an increasing growth rate for the non-host, P. tremuloides, B. papyrifera, and T. occidentalis. Our results suggest that insect outbreaks may offset growth increases resulting from a warmer climate. The observation warrants the inclusion of the spruce budworm defoliation into models predicting future forest productivity.					; Drobyshev, Igor/D-9220-2016	bergeron, yves/0000-0003-3707-3687; Boakye, Emmanuel Amoah/0000-0002-0993-4964; Drobyshev, Igor/0000-0002-5980-4316; Girardin, Martin/0000-0003-0436-7486													2045-7758					MAR	2022	12	3							e8656	10.1002/ece3.8656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8656								35342593					WOS:000774827300001

The discussion increases as this phenomenon is studied in temperate, subtropical, and tropical lakes. This work presents an analysis of the behavior of the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (TN:TP) in Lake Cajititlan (Mexico). This subtropical lake, located within a small endorheic watershed, has presented a notable decrease in the TN:TP ratio in the last few years. Considering a TN:TP ratio <16 as the criterion indicative of nitrogen limitation for lakes located in the central-western region of Mexico, Lake Cajititlan has been predominately nitrogen limited from 2009 to 2020. From 2013 to 2020, the TN:TP ratio has declined to values below 10. This is reported in literature as a threshold value that favors algal blooms in subtropical lakes. This year also corresponds with the start of an unusually large fish die-off in the lake during August and early September. The TN:TP ratio exhibits a seasonal pattern, with the lowest mean values (TN:TP < 10) occurring during the dry season, and the highest values (TN:TP > 10) coincide with the rainy season (TN:TP > 10). The seasonal variations in the TN:TP ratio are primarily controlled by the annual precipitation regime, which increases the organic matter and nutrient loads to the lake mostly from treated and raw wastewater discharges, and from the runoff from agricultural land that extends along the entire lowlands of the lake watershed. The use of the TN:TP ratio as an environmental indicator is proposed, to guide public policies and governance practices in order to reduce the high level of eutrophication of the lake and rescue the potential uses of the lake and its watershed.					; de Anda, José/HTS-2413-2023; DIAZ TORRES, OSIRIS/ISB-3807-2023; Hernández, Misael/ABD-1937-2020	Diaz Torres, Osiris/0000-0002-6211-245X; Diaz-Vazquez, Diego/0000-0001-6801-5776; de Anda, Jose/0000-0001-9521-5968; Gradilla Hernandez, Misael Sebastian/0000-0002-8236-4400; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	2022	233	3							99	10.1007/s11270-022-05566-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05566-0													WOS:000769452200001

WATER												The present study investigates the responses of zooplankton (including changes in their structure and diversity) to physicochemical and biological parameters in two artificial waterways. Water samples were collected monthly from the Bydgoszcz Canal, the Notec Canal, and the Brda River during the growing season of April-October 2019. We analyzed how selected parameters (including water temperature, Secchi disk visibility, oxygen concentration, conductivity, and pH, as well as nitrate, phosphate, and chl-a concentrations) affected seasonal variations in zooplankton diversity (T) and density (N). In total, we recorded 98 species, and average zooplankton density was 320 ind/L. At all sites, the same zooplankton species were dominant: Keratella cochlearis among rotifers and the Cladocera Bosmina longirostris among crustaceans. Rotifers dominated qualitatively and quantitatively over crustaceans. Zooplankton density and biomass, as well as the number of zooplankton species, were higher in the Bydgoszcz Canal than in the Brda River or the Notec Canal. This may be connected to the locks on the Bydgoszcz Canal slowing down water flow, thereby increasing macrophyte vegetation, which creates ecological niches supporting zooplankton development.

S.; Gera, Anitha; Ramu, K.; Rao, Ranga, V; Mv, Ramanamurthy			Influence of salinity on the meiofaunal distribution in a hypersaline lake along the southeast coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The present study highlights that seasonal salinity variability plays a significant role in meiobenthic distribution with special reference to nematode assemblages. Sediment and water samples were collected from Pulicat Lake, a hypersaline lake along the southeast coast of India during two seasons (Southwest Monsoon (SWM) and Northeast Monsoon (NEM)). Based on the salinity distribution, the lake is categorized into four regions, viz., southern inlet, central region, middle inlet, and northern inlet. Meiobenthic abundance was higher during SWM (226-12,206 Ind/10 cm(2)) than in NEM (640-10,424 Ind/10 cm(2)). The meiofaunal abundance was high in the central region during both the seasons, followed by the southern, northern, and middle inlet. The nematode was the dominant meiobenthic group, followed by copepod, polychaete, and foraminifera. Due to high organic matter, the central region was dominated by deposit feeding nematode species like Halalaimus longicaudatus and Terschellingia longicaudata. The southern and northern regions were dominated by free-living nematodes Rhabditis olitoria, Mesorhabditis capitata, Mononochus bastian, Paramononchus sp., Piranchulus sp., and Diploscapter cylindricus. Oncholaimus sp., a hypersaline indicator species, was reported from the middle inlet location. Statistical analysis suggests salinity as a critical parameter for the distribution and diversity of nematodes.					gera, anitha/ABB-6955-2021; GERA, ANITHA/J-3312-2012; Pandiya rajan, R S/AAA-5896-2021	gera, anitha/0000-0002-3736-9763; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2022	194	3							199	10.1007/s10661-022-09829-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09829-5								35178589					WOS:000757407300005

Although it has some of the highest levels of biodiversity and productivity in Asia, the water quality in the basin has recently deteriorated as a consequence of land use changes, dam reservoir construction, population growth, and climate change. For the first time, this study estimates the interannual and monthly variabilities of nutrient fluxes (nitrate - NO3-) and total phosphorus - TP) in the lower Mekong River and Tonle Sap River in Cambodia, and assesses the nutrient linkage between the them. Long-term monitoring data were obtained from Kratie station (in the upper reach of the Mekong River), Chroy Changva station (just upstream of the lower Mekong River-Tonle Sap River confluence), and Prek Kdam station (on the Tonle Sap River similar to 40 km upstream of the confluence and 70 km downstream of Tonle Sap Lake). From 1995 to 2017, the estimated interannual flux of NO3- was 364 +/- 45 kt/y at Kratie and 557 +/- 109 kt/y at Chroy Changva. From 2005 to 2017, the estimated interannual flux of TP was 100 +/- 16 kt/y at Kratie and 73 +/- 19 kt/y at Chroy Changva. Considerable seasonal differences were observed in both fluxes in the Mekong River, with 80-90% of the annual NO3- flux occurring from May to October. The results of the nutrient exchange budget indicated that the NO3- and TP fluxes from the Mekong River into Tonle Sap Lake were similar to 35.8 +/- 12.5 kt/y and similar to 8.7 +/- 3.3 kt/y, respectively, while these were 34.0 +/- 13.8 kt/y and 6.6 +/- 1.4 kt/y, respectively, from Tonle Sap Lake into the Mekong system. The results demonstrate that the Mekong River is a vital nutrient source, especially during the flood season, to Tonle Sap Lake and its floodplain.

Field investigations revealed the seasonal patterns in external total phosphorus (TP) input and TP concentration, as well as the composition of the phytoplankton community. The model was calibrated to reproduce qualitative features and the succession of phytoplankton communities, and the net primary production was calculated. The modeled daily net primary production (NPP) ranged between -16.89 and 15.12 mg C/m(2)/d and exhibited significant seasonal variation. The competition for phosphorus and temperature was identified as the primary governing factor of NPP by analyzing the parameter sensitivity and limitation factors of the lake. The simulation of four nutrient loading reduction scenarios suggested high phytoplankton biomass and NPP sensitivity to the external TP reduction. A significant positive correlation was found among NPP, total phytoplankton biomass and TP concentration. Overall, this work offers an alternative approach to estimating lake NPP, which has the potential to improve sustainable lake management.

Four sampling stations located at the lacustrine (Stations 1, 2 and 3) and riverine (Station 4) zones of the reservoir were designated to gather data. Samples were collected vertically at 5 m, 10 m and 15 m depth. Zooplankton samples were collected by filtering forty litres of lake water using plankton net with 30 mu m mesh size. A total of 28 taxa from three major groups of zooplankton (Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda) were recorded. Pearson's correlation showed that the abundance of zooplankton is directly correlated with most environmental variables including water transparency, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, total dissolved solids, pH, chlorophyll a, ammonium-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen and rainfall. In a similar vein, the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) also revealed that zooplankton abundances were influenced by the combined effects of water quality variables. This was further proven by the fact that the zooplankton diversity, when measured by Shannon-Weiner index, was low probably due to short water retention time and fluctuations in water levels. The results of this study indicated that the occurrence of zooplankton was characterised by the reservoir water conditions based on the value of species-environment correlations (0.66-0.84) in CCA analysis.

Coarse woody habitat does not predict largemouth bass young of year mortality during the open-water season	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Littoral structure is often assumed to provide refuge to young of year (YOY) freshwater fish species, but empirical in situ tests of this relationship are lacking. We estimated mortality rates of YOY largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) over the open-water season in 13 lakes in northern Wisconsin and Michigan using repeated snorkel surveys. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that mortality rate is negatively related to the abundance of littoral coarse woody habitat, which ranged from 3 to 1500 pieces of wood per kilometre of shoreline in these lakes. Instantaneous mortality rates were well-constrained and ranged from 0.04 to 0.19 among the 13 lakes. Mortality was not related to coarse woody habitat abundance. Our results suggest that the relationship between coarse woody habitat and YOY mortality might not be as strong or universal as is often assumed.

In this perspective article, we argue for the need for food environment research to more comprehensively examine the different types of food environments that people access within their communities to ensure that interventions and programs are better aligned with people's lived experiences. We highlight the potential ways in which participatory mapping (PM) can be leveraged to better design food environment research by: (1) identifying the different food environment types that are accessed within a given community; (2) providing insight into the timing for data collection; (3) informing the prioritization of where to conduct food environment assessments; and (4) highlighting the dynamism of food environments over time (e.g., across a given day or across seasons). We provide a case study example of the application of PM and the lessons learned from it in Cambodia.

Whereas one lake (Esthwaite Water) is biologically productive, with a seasonal cycle of phytoplankton activity, including stratification and Fe(III) reduction, and a mineralogy involving quartz, muscovite, and clinochlore, the other (Botany Pond) remains oxic throughout the year. In the latter case, the sediment is predominantly quartz and calcite. Chemical analyses of these two lake sediments reflect the differences in mineralogy and show that both contain significant organic carbon (similar to 10-12 wt %) and smaller amounts of S (similar to 0.2-1.7 wt %) and Cl (similar to 0.4-1.1 wt %). Despite the substantial amounts of organic matter in both sediments, the spectroscopic data show that the mercury occurs as a sulfide phase with a local structural environment akin to that in cinnabar. Parallel spectroscopic studies conducted on Hg either coprecipitated or sorbed onto FeS (mackinawite), and on oxidized mackinawite, provide supporting information; the possibility of Hg forming a chloride was eliminated by careful mapping of the relevant elements by an electron microprobe. It appears, therefore, that the high affinity of Hg for S predominates even in substantially oxic environments.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 1	2005	39	17					6644	6648		10.1021/es048874z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es048874z								16190223					WOS:000231723800051

Due to the continuously increasing earth's surface temperature, the rate of water evaporation is enhanced, conceiving a problem of soil salinization, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The accumulation of salt degrades soil quality, impairs plant growth, and reduces agricultural yields. Salt-tolerant, plant-growth-promoting microorganisms may offer a solution, enhancing crop productivity and soil fertility in salinized areas. In the current study, genome-resolved metagenomic analysis has been performed to investigate the salt-tolerating and plant growth-promoting potential of two hypersaline ecosystems, Sambhar Lake and Drang Mine. The samples were co-assembled independently by Megahit, MetaSpades, and IDBA-UD tools. A total of 67 metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed following the binning process, including 15 from Megahit, 26 from MetaSpades, and 26 from IDBA_UD assembly tools. As compared to other assemblers, the MAGs obtained by MetaSpades were of superior quality, with a completeness range of 12.95%-96.56% and a contamination range of 0%-8.65%. The medium and high-quality MAGs from MetaSpades, upon functional annotation, revealed properties such as salt tolerance (91.3%), heavy metal tolerance (95.6%), exopolysaccharide (95.6%), and antioxidant (60.86%) biosynthesis. Several plant growth-promoting attributes, including phosphate solubilization and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, were consistently identified across all obtained MAGs. Conversely, characteristics such as iron acquisition and potassium solubilization were observed in a substantial majority, specifically 91.3%, of the MAGs. The present study indicates that hypersaline microflora can be used as bio-fertilizing agents for agricultural practices in salinized areas by alleviating prevalent stresses.IMPORTANCEThe strategic implementation of metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) in exploring the properties and harnessing microorganisms from ecosystems like hypersaline niches has transformative potential in agriculture. This approach promises to redefine our comprehension of microbial diversity and its ecosystem roles. Recovery and decoding of MAGs unlock genetic resources, enabling the development of new solutions for agricultural challenges. Enhanced understanding of these microbial communities can lead to more efficient nutrient cycling, pest control, and soil health maintenance. Consequently, traditional agricultural practices can be improved, resulting in increased yields, reduced environmental impacts, and heightened sustainability. MAGs offer a promising avenue for sustainable agriculture, bridging the gap between cutting-edge genomics and practical field applications.

Although the influence of environmental factors on the abundance of aquatic animals is fairly well documented, less has been done to research their influence on food web interactions. The aim of the study was to evaluate microbial and classical food webs in lakes, with special emphasis placed on the role of environmental factors as influencing strengths. Variation partitioning, based on redundancy analysis, revealed that environmental factors played the most important role in structuring aquatic communities by accounting for 87.5% of their variation. Among all the factors measured, total solids (TS), transparency (Secchi disc) and temperature were most closely related to the variation in trophic communities. The analyses of food web interactions under low and high levels of those factors revealed that they differently influenced strengths among food web components. The strongest relations among distinct trophic levels were found under conditions of low TS, the lowest number of relations was found under conditions of low temperature. Only in low TS did bacteria correlate significantly with biogenes. Under high TS, bacteria positively influenced plenty of higher trophic levels. Top-down control was observed under conditions of high temperature. Conditions of low and high transparency did not diversify food web interactions. The obtained results can broaden our knowledge of the response of food webs to environmental factors in advanced stages of global eutrophication of water bodies and in the early stage of projected trends of global climate change.

Keeping moderate WLFs approximating to its natural conditions is substantially essential to maintain its biodiversity and integrity. In this study, a hydrological index based method for determining ecologically acceptable water-level range (EAWLR) was illustrated by a case-study of Dongting Lake. This method was proposed based on a consideration of hydrological alterations induced by natural variability and human activity. It was during this process that two hydrological indices, the ratio flow deviation (RFD) and the amended annual proportional flow deviation (AAPFD), played vital roles in change point detection and the determination of EAWLR, respectively. The WLFs are closely related to species richness. The relationship between them follows a hump-backed curve and EAWLR serves as the hump part of the curve. The final results indicated that EAWLRs of Beijinggang, Nanzui and Chenglingji during flood season were 27.78-38.26 m, 25.19-38.45 m and 24.48-30.96 m, respectively, while those during non-flood season were 18.33-27.79 m, 17.68-29.19 m and 15.59-22.07 m, respectively. The response to the great flood in 1998 and the drought in 2006 of Dongting Lake region verified the rationality of the results. Within the EAWLR, ecosystems can operate normally and have stable community structures to resist external interference.					; Wu, Haipeng/O-2852-2015; guangming, zeng/AHD-0360-2022; Li, Xiaodong/J-2215-2016; YUAN, Yujie/AAA-6260-2021; Liang, Jie/P-4649-2015	Liang, Jie/0000-0002-1979-9356; Wu, Haipeng/0000-0002-9888-6959; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2015	74	1					75	84		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.914	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.914													WOS:000352405900008

How temperature affects timing and duration of yellow perch spawning in the Indiana waters of Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Adult yellow perch were collected from the Indiana waters of Lake Michigan during 2009, 2011, and 2012 to estimate the length and timing of the yellow perch spawning season. Sampling was conducted using gill nets at three zones near East Chicago, Burns Harbor, and Michigan City from May to August in 2009 and 2011; however, sampling was conducted twice in April before continuing from May to August in 2012. After collection, yellow perch were measured, counted, and sexed and then the maturity state was determined. Logistic regression was used to model the proportion of post-spawn (spent) fish over time for each year. The resulting models estimated the timing and duration of yellow perch spawning and allowed the determination of peak spawn (50% spent) for each year. We found that yellow perch spawning started when mean daily water temperatures at the sample sites reached approximately 11 degrees C and lasted two to four weeks with cessation occurring when water temperatures exceeded 13 degrees C. In 2009 and 2011, spawning began in mid-May and was finished in early June, while in 2012 spawning started in early May and finished before June. These differences were likely in response to unseasonably warm lake temperatures caused by record high springtime air temperatures in the Great Lakes region. These findings suggest global climate change will alter yellow perch reproductive cycles.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					2015	30	3					445	453		10.1080/02705060.2014.988761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2014.988761													WOS:000373481900010

According to climate predictions, arid and semi-arid regions will become warmer, and a critical consequence for lake ecosystems is salinization. Salinity, a critical abiotic factor influencing zooplankton survival, changes the trophic interactions in a lake. We explored the potential effects of conductivity (an indirect measure of salinity) on the zooplankton taxa in three lakes located in the Konya Closed Basin, Turkey. Zooplankton taxa show significant differences between lakes of low and high conductivity but do not display significant seasonal difference except Cladocera. Species diversity is shown to decrease with conductivity. Large-sized cladocerans such as Daphnia and Simocephalus appear in freshwater lakes; conversely, the halobiont Brachionus plicatilis was observed only in the brackish lake. Our results show that the changes in salinity will have a substantial impact on aquatic ecosystems.					; Tavşanoğlu, Ülkü/AGK-9942-2022	Tavsanoglu, Ulku Nihan/0000-0001-8462-415X; 													1300-1361						2015	24	94					25	32		10.5053/ekoloji.2015.944	http://dx.doi.org/10.5053/ekoloji.2015.944													WOS:000353935300004

Spatiotemporal dynamics of microbial communities and cyanobacteria blooms in two North American Lakes using long-read 16S rRNA sequencing	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Understanding spatial and temporal heterogeneity in ecosystems is essential to forecasting the effects of environmental changes. Freshwater microbes, including cyanobacteria, play a crucial role in food-web structures and biochemical processes, yet can exhibit substantial heterogeneity through space and time. They also act as powerful indicators of natural and human-induced stress due to their high metabolic and rapid response to environmental change. The formation of cyanobacteria blooms can be particularly important due to the potential production of toxins that are harmful to humans and wildlife. While high water temperatures and high nutrients are largely recognized as triggers of cyanobacterial bloom formation, there is growing evidence of the role of its associated microbiome in bloom formation. The inability to accurately forecast cyanobacteria blooms is challenged by uncertainty in the degree to which microbial diversity, and bloom forming taxa in particular, exhibit spatial heterogeneity and how spatial heterogeneity varies seasonally or between lakes spanning the trophic gradient. Here, we used long-read sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to quantify variations in microbial spatiotemporal dynamics over the course of an ice-free season between two lakes that varied substantially in trophic status. Our results showed that the microbial community composition of eutrophic Chautauqua Lake was seasonally and spatially structured; however, during bloom events we observed lower diversity and a homogeneous community dominated by Microcystis and enriched with Gammaproteobacteria. In oligotrophic Lake George, seasonality rather than the basin of origin played a major role in structuring the microbial community; however, there was a significant difference between basins when controlling for the temporal effect and was linked to a South-to-North anthropogenic gradient. This study provides a solid foundation for exploiting longread sequencing of prokaryotes and couples sequencing with traditional water quality monitoring to assess microbial dynamics (e.g., cyanobacteria bloom microbiome) and the effect of local and global stressors.

J	Binning, SA; Chapman, LJ				Binning, Sandra A.; Chapman, Lauren J.			Is intraspecific variation in diet and morphology related to environmental gradients? Exploring Liem's paradox in a cichlid fish	INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY												Interspecific studies have demonstrated that trophic morphology and ecology are not always tightly matched: a phenomenon rarely reported at the intraspecific level. In the present study, we explored relationships among diet, morphology and the environment in a widespread cichlid fish, Astatoreochromis alluaudi (Pellegrin 1904), from 6 sites in southern Uganda to test for evidence of eco-morphological matching at the interdemic level. Previous studies of Astatoreochromis alluaudi have demonstrated developmental plasticity in trophic morphology in response to diet: a mollusk diet produces specimens with large pharyngeal jaws and muscles, whereas a soft-food diet produces smaller pharyngeal jaws and corresponding changes in musculature. Sites were chosen to maximize variability in environmental variables that might directly or indirectly affect trophic morphology. We found significant differences in pharyngeal jaw and muscle morphology among populations. Similarly, we found differences in diets among sites: mollusks were found in the stomachs of fish from only 2 populations sampled, despite the presence of mollusks in 5 of the 6 sites. Although trophic morphology did match the observed diet in 2 sites, diet did not correlate with either morphology or environmental variables across sites, nor were environmental variables correlated with morphological variation among sites. These results suggest that mismatch can occur among different populations of a single species for reasons such as seasonality in resources, developmental plasticity and/or complex indirect interactions. Intraspecific mechanisms should be further studied in order to better understand the complex relationships between morphological specialization and ecological generalization.

A Decision Support Tool to Guide the Use of Nest Exclosures for Piping Plover Conservation	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Wire cages (exclosures) that exclude nest predators are regularly used for management of federally threatened and endangered populations of piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) and similar species. However, recent evidence that apparent nest abandonment related to exclosure use is indicative of adult mortality has led to concern about the technique. We developed a decision support tool named PiperEx that uses site-specific nest-fate data to inform a stochastic population projection model to predict population growth rate at the site level with and without exclosure use. Underlying PiperEx is a Bayesian logistic-exposure multinomial nest fate model, with informative priors based on analysis of 1,312 piping plover nests monitored throughout the U.S. Atlantic Coast in 2015 and 2016. We used simulated nest fate data sets and real nest data from 3 management areas from 2013 to 2018 to test tool performance. Based on simulations, the probability of making the correct decision increased with sample size, exceeding 80% with 20 nests. Decisions recommended by the tool were robust to variation in demographic parameters. Using real data, the decision for a given year only matched the decision for the immediately previous year 16% to 67% of the time, whereas data pooled across years predicted the best decision for a particular year up to 100% of the time for a given area. We used a case study of Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge to demonstrate that the optimal decision is sensitive to how a site was defined. We recommend that data for PiperEx be collected on an annual basis, and data for the previous 5 or 6 years be pooled for making a decision at the start of the season. Further development of the tool should focus on its use to make regional recommendations, and use of multiple years of data to improve the capability of the tool to make robust site-specific recommendations.

This is the primary limiting factor for understanding the fate of toxins in the interface between water and sediment in both the aquatic ecosystem as well as in soils. In the present study, a wide range of extraction solvents were evaluated over a wide range of pH, extraction approaches and equilibration time to optimize an effective extraction procedure for the analysis of microcystins in soils and lake sediments. The number of extractions required and acids in extraction solutions were also studied. In this procedure, EDTA-sodium pyrophosphate solution was selected as an extraction solvent based on the adsorption mechanism study. The optimized procedure proved to be highly efficient and achieved over 90% recovery. Finally, the developed procedure was applied to field soil and sediment sample collected from Chinese lakes during bloom seasons and microcystins were determined in six of ten samples.

Since the pioneering population genetic studies on freshwater zooplankton in the 1970's, a distinction has been made between the genetic structure of permanent and intermittent populations. However, the results of many studies do not fit the expectations of this dichotomous model, for example when large lake populations are considered. In this paper, we present a unifying framework for understanding the genetic structure of cyclic parthenogenetic zooplankton populations, focusing on three factors that determine their degree of clonality and within-population genetic diversity as well as their among-population genetic differentiation: the size of the dormant egg bank, length of the growing season, and strength of clonal selection. We illustrate the importance of each of these factors, and show that our broader concept better explains the variation in genetic structure observed in natural populations of cyclic parthenogens than the earlier implicitly dichotomous model.

Tana, Ethiopia)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The spatial and seasonal distribution of microcrustacean zooplankton of Lake Tana (Ethiopia) was monthly studied for 2 years. Concurrently, various environmental parameters were measured and related to zooplankton distribution. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to estimate the influence of abiotic factors and chlorophyll a content in structuring the zooplankton assemblage. Among the environmental factors, zooplankton abundance correlated most strongly with turbidity. Turbidity was negatively correlated with species abundance, especially for Daphnia spp. and to the least extent for Diaphanosoma spp. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine spatial (littoral, sublittoral and pelagic zone) and temporal (four seasons) variation in zooplankton abundance. We observed significant temporal differences in zooplankton abundance, with highest densities during dry season (November-April). Only cladocerans showed significant differences in habitat use (highest densities in the sublittoral zone).

Here, for the first time, we have further used the altimetry-derived variation of water level for estimating the fluctuation of water storage as an addition to the present in situ water storage estimation systems to be used in remote areas and in emergency situation such as in the events flooding monitoring and for studying the effect of climate change. Lake Dongting, the second largest lake in China, influenced frequently by flooding, was, therefore, chosen to demonstrate the potential of the technique. By using the concept of an "assumed reference point", we converted Topex/Poseidon satellite altimetry data on water level variations in Lake Dongting to "water level" data. The "water level" time-series data and in situ water storage were used to establish a rating curve. From the rating curve, we converted data on "water level" derived from seven years (1993-1999) of Topex/Poseidon data to actual water storage in Lake Dongting. The result reveals that the seasonal and annual fluctuations of water storage occurred during the 1990s with a more frequent flooding at the late 1990s' especially the flooding in whole catchment level in 1998 and 1999. The study supports the usefulness of satellite altimetry for dense and continuous monitoring of the temporal variations in water dynamic in moderate to large lakes.					; Xu, Kai-Qin/A-6253-2011	Xu, Kaiqin/0000-0003-0781-3031; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2006	115	1-3					23	37		10.1007/s10661-006-5233-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-006-5233-9								16502025					WOS:000238973500002

The Mexican Black-bellied Gartersnake inhabits banks of streams, rivers, canals, ponds, and lakes, where it captures fishes, leeches, crayfishes, tadpoles, earthworms, and frogs by foraging underwater. There was no geographic variation between the Lerma and Tula populations in proportions of prey taxa consumed, but whereas primary and secondary tadpole stages were consumed by snakes in Lerma, only secondary stages were consumed by snakes in Tula. Crayfishes, novel prey for this genus, were consumed over a restricted zone in the contiguous headwaters of the Lerma and Tula drainages. Interannual and seasonal variation in proportions of annelids and anurans ingested was documented in the Nazas population, and attributed to temporal change in relative abundance of prey taxa and snake size classes. Snake size was a major determinant of diet in all three drainages, affecting proportions of different prey taxa consumed and the upper limits on the mass of ingested prey. In the three drainages, sexes were similar in body size and consumed the same prey taxa in similar proportions and masses. We discuss proximate and functional determinants of diet and suggest that the observed interannual and seasonal variation observed in Mexican Black-bellied Snakes is due mostly to temporal variation in prey availability and proportions of snake size classes.					; Manjarrez, Javier/S-3082-2019; Garcia, Constantino/S-1948-2019	Macias Garcia, Constantino/0000-0003-3242-4214; MANJARREZ, JAVIER/0000-0003-3053-3257; 													0022-1511	1937-2418				SEP	2013	47	3					413	420		10.1670/12-174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1670/12-174													WOS:000325998800004
J	Mellard, JP; Yoshiyama, K; Klausmeier, CA; Litchman, E				Mellard, Jarad P.; Yoshiyama, Kohei; Klausmeier, Christopher A.; Litchman, Elena			Experimental test of phytoplankton competition for nutrients and light in poorly mixed water columns	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												A recent theory of the vertical distribution of phytoplankton considers how interacting niche construction processes such as resource depletion, behavior, and population dynamics contribute to spatial heterogeneity in the aquatic environment. In poorly mixed water columns with opposing resource gradients of nutrients and light, theory predicts that a species should aggregate at a single depth. This depth of aggregation, or biomass maximum, should change through time due to depletion of available resources. In addition, the depth of the aggregation should be deeper under low amounts of nutrient loading and shallower under higher amounts of nutrient loading. Theory predicts total biomass to exhibit a saturating relationship with nutrient supply. A surface biomass maximum limited by light and a deep biomass maximum limited by nutrients or co-limited by nutrients and light is also predicted by theory. To test this theory, we used a motile phytoplankton species (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) growing in cylindrical plankton towers. In our experiment, the resource environment was strongly modified by the movement, self-shading, nutrient uptake, and growth of the phytoplankton. Supporting predictions, we routinely observed a single biomass maximum at the surface throughout the course of the experiment and at equilibrium under higher nutrient loading. However, at equilibrium, low nutrient loading led to a non-distinct biomass maximum with the population distributed over most of the water column instead of the distinct subsurface peak predicted by theory. Also supporting predictions, total biomass across water columns was positively related to nutrient supply but saturating at high nutrient supply conditions. Further supporting predictions, we also found evidence of light limitation for a surface biomass maximum and nutrient limitation for the deep biomass when no surface maximum was present. In addition, the light level leaving the bottom of the water column declined through time as the phytoplankton grew and was negatively related to nutrient loading. Nutrients were strongly depleted where biomass was present by the end of the experiment. This experimental study shows that the vertical distribution of phytoplankton may be driven by intraspecific resource competition in space.

Recent sedimentation rates in Garaet El Ichkeul Lake, NW Tunisia, as affected by the construction of dams and a regulatory sluice	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Ichkeul National Park, NW Tunisia, is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Garaet El Ichkeul Lake is known for its seasonal variability in water level and salinity. In recent decades, the waterbody has been affected by the construction of new hydraulic structures. To reduce the impacts of dams and to maintain the sustainability of the ecosystem, a sluice was built at the outlet of the lake, and it operated for the first time in 1996. This paper describes an investigation of recent sedimentation dynamics in Ichkeul Lake, determined by radiometric dating of sediment cores. A sediment core was collected with a UWITEC gravity corer at the deepest, central part of the lake in August 2009. Specific activities of unsupported lead-210 (Pb-210) and caesium-137 (Cs-137) were measured in the core, enabling calculation of recent sediment accumulation rates (SAR). Published radiometric data from nearby sediment cores, collected in 1997 and 1982, provide a comparison. The measured excess Pb-210 inventory was 5300 +/- 500 Bq m(-2), leading to an estimation of constant flux of 165 +/- 16 Bq m(-2) yr(-1), a value higher than the best estimate for local atmospheric fluxes (123 +/- 12 Bq m(-2) yr(-1)) and the flux estimated from the core collected in 1982 (48 Bq m(-2) yr(-1)). The Cs-137 inventory was 3550 +/- 120 Bq m(-2), two times higher than the historical Cs-137 atmospheric deposition in the area. The Cs-137 profile displayed a distinct peak, but the Cs-137 depth-distribution did not follow the pattern expected from atmospheric deposition. Application of the constant rate of supply (CRS) model, with the reference point method, produced a chronology and SAR values comparable to those found in previous work. The whole Cs-137 profile was quantitatively reconstructed from the historical records of atmospheric deposition, using the system-time-averaged (STA) model. The CRS and STA models provide consistent sediment accumulation results for the whole data set, considering the time resolution of the chronology ( 6 years) and analytical uncertainties. Results from cores sampled in 1982, 1997 and 2009 reveal an increasing SAR trend, from 0.25 g cm(-2) yr(-1) in the early 1940s to 0.67 g cm(-2) yr(-1) at present. In the 13 years since installation of sluice gates at Tinja, SAR in the central Ichkeul Lake has not declined. Thus, if siltation continues at the present rate, shallowing of the lake will seriously affect the hydromorphology and ecology of this important lake.

Supraglacial lake spatial structure in western Greenland during the 2007 ablation season	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Increases in surface melt rates along the Greenland ice sheet margin have accelerated meltwater production, resulting in supraglacial lakes that can drain rapidly and enhance basal sliding. In this study, supraglacial lakes in western Greenland are mapped from multitemporal Landsat panchromatic imagery during the 2007 melt season. The analysis models lake spatial structure and establishes sequencing of drainage from 6 June through 9 August 2007. Results indicate high spatial clustering at lower elevations (between similar to 100 and 700 m), with minimum lake-to-lake distances of similar to 100-500 m and lake sizes <0.5 km(2). At higher elevations (700-1200 m), clustering decreases with minimum distances on the order of 900-1400 m and lake sizes between 0.5 and 1 km(2). Lakes at elevations above 1200 m exhibit less clustering and smaller areas. Clustering was spatially heterogeneous within elevation bands, with high clustering between ice streams and fewer lakes along shear margins. Spatial patterns of lake drainage throughout the 2007 melt season exhibit strong spatial coherency. The magnitude of clustering reveals patterns caused by surface melt production and water routing through surface streams as well as in situ drainage. Cluster patterns are influenced by proximity to crevasses fields, shear margins, as well as topographic structure.

J	Gale, E; Pattiaratchi, C; Ranasinghe, R				Gale, Emma; Pattiaratchi, Charitha; Ranasinghe, Roshanka			Vertical mixing processes in Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes and Lagoons, and the dissolved oxygen response	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes and Lagoons (ICOLLs) are located on micro-tidal coasts (max. tidal range < 2 m) in temperate regions where the annual rainfall is non-seasonal. ICOLLs are generally shallow (< 5 m depth) and are closed to the ocean due to the formation of an entrance bar for the majority of the year, when rainfalls are low. After periods of heavy rainfall, the super elevated water levels result in the natural or artificial breaching of the entrance bar. Due to their small size and absence of significant river inflows, ICOLLs exhibit strong temporal variations in their vertical density gradients, which can result in episodic density stratification. Such episodic stratification events may result in deterioration of the water quality including toxic algal blooms. This paper presents the results of field studies undertaken to determine the physical processes governing vertical mixing/stratification in ICOLLs and their implications on dissolved oxygen dynamics. Data from two contrasting ICOLLs located along the southeastern coastline of Australia; (a) Wamberal Lagoon a small, shallower (similar to 2 m max. depth) frequently open ICOLL; and, (2) Smiths Lake, a larger, deeper (similar to 5 m max. depth) infrequently open ICOLL, are presented. The results indicated that Wamberal Lagoon was susceptible to periods of stratification during both the closed and the open states. During the closed state, periods of rainfall, low wind and/or high solar insolation led to short (< 3 days) and irregular stratification events, whilst during the open state, stratification events occurred through a combination of rainfall, low winds and variations in tidal mixing. There was a tendency for dissolved oxygen to decrease, in the bottom waters, when the Buoyancy Frequency was > 0.1 s(-1). Smiths Lake demonstrated higher vertical stability and exhibited a tendency for persistent stratification, during both the closed and open states, primarily due to solar insolation (closed state) and gravitational circulation (open state), respectively. The persistent stratification maintained a vertical gradient in dissolved oxygen between the surface and bottom layers. However, tidal pumping associated with fortnightly tides appears to promote isolation of the bottom waters, causing the dissolved oxygen rates to temporarily decrease (for approximately 5 days) during the neap cycle.

Molecular genetic identification and seasonal succession of toxigenic cyanobacteria in phytoplankton of the Rybinsk Reservoir (Russia)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Data on the hepato- and neurotoxigenic cyanobacteria in phytoplankton of the Rybinsk Reservoir have been obtained for the first time. Different methods for revealing toxigenic cyanobacteria (light microscopy, PCR analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) demonstrate the same results. Hepatotoxins microcystins and for the first time neurotoxins saxitoxins were detected in the reservoir, whereas cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin-a were not revealed. The presence of mcyE and stxA genes responsible for microcystin and saxitoxin biosynthesis in total phytoplanktonic DNA is demonstrated. The following three genera of cyanobacteria containing mcyE gene are identified: Microcystis (M. aeruginosa, M. viridis), Planktothrix (P. agardhii), and Dolichospermum (Anabaena). It is hypothesized that saxitoxin-producing cyanobacteria Dolichospermum (Anabaena) inhabit the Rybinsk Reservoir.

Piscivory does not cause pansteatitis (yellow fat disease) in Oreochromis mossambicus from an African subtropical reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Pansteatitis (yellow fat disease) is ubiquitous in the free-ranging population of Oreochromis mossambicus from Loskop Reservoir (LR), South Africa. The disease is nutritionally mediated and associated with a diet high in polyunsaturated or rancid fats, frequently of fish origin. While piscivory has never been reported in dietary studies of O.mossambicus in their native range, their opportunistic and omnivorous feeding habits mean that piscivory cannot be ruled out as a cause of the disease. The diet of O.mossambicus from LR (n=91) was compared with a population from Flag Boshielo Reservoir (FBR; n=81) located <100km downstream, where no pansteatitis occurs. The stomach contents and stable isotope signatures (15N and 13C) of fish and food sources were evaluated across four seasons. Isotope signatures were also compared over various time scales from historic samples and mortalities collected from LR. There was no evidence of piscivorous feeding behaviour in fish from either location or from historic LR samples. The results of the stable isotope analysis in R mixing model and stomach contents analysis showed that the dinoflagellate, Ceratium hirundinella, was the dominant food source followed by zooplankton, detritus and Microcystis aeruginosa in LR. The diet of fish from FBR was less diverse than fish from LR and was dominated by sediment and detritus. The distinguishing feature of the dietary comparison between reservoirs was the abundance of planktonic food items dominated by C.hirundinella in the diet of fish from LR. The lack of evidence for piscivory among O.mossambicus from LR suggests that the classic aetiology of pansteatitis does not apply. This highlights the need to further explore direct (environmental exposure to pollutants) and indirect (dietary exposure) links to pansteatitis. This study identified the major dietary constituents for O.mossambicus, which enables future research to focus on their nutritional and chemical composition.

At higher latitudes, the time period associated with canopy avoidance is shorter and occurs at cooler temperatures, increasing the risk of frost damage In 2008, leaf-out began 5 days prior to the last frost of the season By modeling the potential carbon gain of seedlings, it is clear that the short time period prior to canopy leaf-out still contributes a disproportionate amount of carbon to the overall budget of seedlings Of the total seasonal carbon gain, 80.6% was assimilated in the initial 15 days following sugar maple seedling leaf-out. Based on our model, by leafing out only 6 days earlier than the average seedling leaf-out date. similar to 200% more carbon could be assimilated during the course of the growing season. Vegetation phenology is cued by climatic triggers - as climate changes so too will phenological responses. These mechanisms add to the overall carbon budget of seedlings; recognizing these mechanisms is essential to thoroughly understand the natural history of this species.

Landscape evolution, alluvial architecture, environmental history, and the archaeological record of the Upper Mississippi River Valley	GEOMORPHOLOGY					39th Annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium	OCT 09-11, 2008	Austin, TX					The alluvial fill in the Upper Mississippi River Valley (UMV) is a palimpsest of past landscapes, environments, and physical evidence of human life ways. The valley has undergone significant changes in fluvial style during the time humans have occupied its landscapes, including changes in channel pattern, location of depocenters, and sediment lithology. Remnants of late-glacial braidplains that predate human presence in the Upper Midwest occur as sandy terraces and terrace fills. A subsequent major change in alluvial architecture resulted from fundamental changes in seasonal water and sediment input that marked the end of glacial meltwater input into the valley about 12.4 ka (10,500 C-14 yr B.P.). A shift to net transport of sandy bedload and storage of fine-grained overbank sediment on the floodplain accompanied the change to an island-braided channel pattern at that time. The Holocene channel belt has been significantly narrower, and the zone of sediment storage is reduced relative to that of the late-glacial river. Major Holocene depocenters include alluvial fans and colluvial slopes, floodbasins, natural levees, and fluvial fans at the junction of large tributaries. Climate models, and paleobotanical, and isotopic studies indicate that shifts in large-scale patterns of atmospheric circulation and moisture transport into the mid-continent of North America induced hydrologic and vegetation changes that strongly influenced flood frequency and magnitude, the delivery of sediment from tributary basins, and the evolution of the UMV landscape. Understanding the alluvial architecture of the valley, and the temporal/spatial distribution of biotic environments and processes that have buried. mixed, altered, or destroyed archaeological deposits is essential to develop strategies for sampling the valley for evidence of past human activity and for properly interpreting the archaeological record.

In this study, we developed a lake-zoning framework by investigating the lateral dispersion of inflow pollutants through dye tracking experiments in a case study of a large shallow lake (Lake Chaohu) in China. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic and mass transport model was used to quantify the impacts of inflow rivers on this lake. Results from 2012 to 2014 showed that the lake zoning results were more stable at the annual scale than at the seasonal scale, implying that the seasonal scale is not suitable for the establishment of lake zones. A driving factor analysis showed that inflow discharge was a more critical factor determining lake zones than wind conditions. In contrast to previous lake zoning methods, the proposed framework implements lake zoning quantitatively through hydrodynamic modelling.

Effective remediation/conservation measures require accurate qualitative and quantitative knowledge of. nutrient sources, transport. mechanisms, transformations and annual dynamics of different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forms. In this paper, nitrate (NO3-N), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations,and loads are presented for two. adjacent rural basins of 306 km(2) and 424 km(2) and for five sub-basins differing in size (between 1 km(2) and 33 km(2)), land use (extent of forest cover between 20% and 93%) and household pressure (from 0 to 40 peopld/km(2)) with the aim of studying the influence of land use and catchment size on nutrient exports. The studied catchments are all situated on Devonian schistous substrates in the Ardennes region (Belgium-Luxembourg), and therefore have similar hydrological regimes. As-the study period could not be the same for all basins, annual export coefficients were corrected with the, 25 years normalized: discharge of the monthly runoff were used to Sure River: two regression analyses (for dry and humid periods) relating monthly nutrient loads to 0 determine correction factors to be applied to each parameter and each basin. This, procedure allows for the. comparing annual export coefficients from basins sampled in different years. Results show a marked seasonal response and a large variability of NO3-N export loads between forested (4 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), agricultural,(27-33 kg N ha(-1) year and mixed catchments (1722 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). For SRP and TP, no significant agricultural impact was found. Land and bank erosion control the total P massflow in the studied catchments (0.4-1.3 kg P ha(-1) year(-1)), which is mostly in a particulate form, detached and transported during storm events. Soluble reactive P fluxes ranged between 10% and 30% of the TP mass, depending on the importance of point sources in the basins studied. No relation was found between the size of the basins and the export of nitrate, SRP or TR Nutrient export, specially for NO3-N and TP, shows significant inter-annual variations, closely linked to inter-annual discharge variations. Flow and load frequency data analysis confirm this association for all the basins on an annual basis. Seasonal or storm specific fluxes strongly deviate from their annual values.

In spite of this, the Water Treatment Works abstracts raw water from this bay and has been able to produce drinking water of sufficient quality for the capital. This study monitored various physical chemical components within the bay during 2000-2003 to understand the processes responsible for the acceptable quality of raw water. Four sampling stations were located along a transect from the channel mouth towards the open lake. Results: showed that the wastewater did not accumulate in the bay, instead was already strongly diluted 2.5 km from the channel mouth. This caused an abrupt reduction in conductivity and the concentrations of the nutrients total phosphorus (Tot-P), orthophosphate (PO4-P) and total nitrogen (Tot-N). Inshore-offshore exchange of water was mediated by flows from daily and sub-daily water level fluctuations and wind-driven currents. As a daily average, 2% of the Murchison Bay flowed in and out and the incoming wastewater was diluted 9.7 times. During the dry season from June to August (D2), when the weather was influenced by the south-east monsoon, the thermal stratification in the main lake disappeared and cooler and deoxygenated water from deeper depths entered the bay influencing its water quality. The daily flushing of water in and out of the bay due to water level variation was identified as the main factor diluting the bay water. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Here, we provide high-resolution lake-level records from New Long Pond and Rocky Pond in southeastern Massachusetts, which each contain evidence for multiple, sub-centennial-to-millennial scale low stands during the transition between the Late Pleistocene (15.0 ka) and Middle Holocene (ca 7.0 ka). Data from New Long Pond also demonstrate sedimentary evidence for a drop in water levels in the early to mid AD 20th century, when long-term trends in instrumental data show lower-than-average precipitation in the northeastern United States. Local data show the most precipitous declines in precipitation and groundwater levels are concurrent with the most severe drought in the AD 1960s, which occurred during a period of low sea-surface temperatures in the western North Atlantic. Ground penetrating radar and sediment core data indicate five intervals with numerous paleo-shoreline deposits between ca 15.0 and 7.0 ka, similar to the layer deposited in the AD 1960s. Many of the intervals of low lake levels coincide with proposed meltwater release events or abrupt climate oscillations in the circum North Atlantic. For example, we document at least three low stands during the Younger Dryas (12.9-11.6 ka) and in association with the "9.2" and "8.2" ka events. The combined evidence of (1) concurrent paleo-droughts in southeastern New England with documented North Atlantic abrupt cooling events and (2) recent drought with the modern association of low sea-surface temperatures indicates that freshening and cooling of the western North Atlantic is a viable mechanism for decreasing moisture within the region. Large-scale changes in seasonality and ice sheet extent also may have increased the susceptibility of the northeast to dry conditions triggered by changes in the North Atlantic.

At one location in southeastern Lake Ontario, we measured the vertical distribution of mysids, mysid predators (i.e. planktivorous fishes) and mysid prey (i.e. zooplankton), in addition to light and temperature, on 8 occasions from May to September, 2004 and 2005. We use these data to test 3 different predictive models of mysid habitat selection, based on: (1) laboratory-derived responses of mysids to different light and temperature gradients in the absence of predator or prey cues; (2) growth rate of mysids, as estimated with a mysid bioenergetics model, given known prey densities and temperatures at different depths in the water column; (3) ratio of growth rates (g) and mortality risk (mu) associated with the distribution of predatory fishes. The model based on light and temperature preferences was a better predictor of mysid vertical distribution than the models based on growth rate and g:mu on all 8 occasions. Although mysid temperature and light preferences probably evolved as mechanisms to reduce predation while increasing foraging intake, the response to temperature and light alone predicts mysid vertical distribution across seasons in Lake Ontario.

The findings from regression analysis show that MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature data (MOD11A1) and Ocean Color MODIS/Terra Sea Surface Temperature (SST)-SeaDAS data are closely related to in situ data as evidenced by a relatively high correlation coefficient (r(2) values of 0.7 and 0.74, respectively). In the light of the above, the developed algorithm may be used for estimating lake surface temperature over Lake Malawi from MODIS satellite imagery. Maps of temperature distribution that were generated for the lake from MODIS satellite imagery show that the circulation pattern of Lake Malawi is very complex, with no clear set pattern of temperature distribution over the entire lake. However, the persistence of a cold water zone between Salima and the northern part of Nkhotakota may be indicative of an upwelling region, ideal for the development of fishery industry. Inadequate satellite data made it difficult to assess whether or not the triple window equation previously developed by Wooster et al. [Wooster, M., Patterson, G., Loftie, R., Sear, C.. 2001.

J	Taylor, AH; Beaty, RM				Taylor, AH; Beaty, RM			Climatic influences on fire regimes in the northern Sierra Nevada Mountains, Lake Tahoe Basin, Nevada, USA	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The goal of this study was to understand better the role of interannual and interdecadal climatic variation on local pre-EuroAmerican settlement fire regimes in fire-prone Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) dominated forests in the northern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Location Our study was conducted in a 6000-ha area of contiguous mixed Jeffrey pine-white fir (Abies concolor Gordon & Glend.) forest on the western slope of the Carson Range on the eastern shore of Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Methods Pre-EuroAmerican settlement fire regimes (i.e. frequency, return interval, extent, season) were reconstructed in eight contiguous watersheds for a 200-year period (1650-1850) from fire scars preserved in the annual growth rings of nineteenth century cut stumps and recently dead pre-settlement Jeffrey pine trees. Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) and correlation analysis were used to examine relationships between tree ring-based reconstructions of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and pre-EuroAmerican fire regimes in order to assess the influence of drought and equatorial and north Pacific teleconnections on fire occurrence and fire extent. Results For the entire period of record (1650-1850), wet conditions were characteristic of years without fires. In contrast, fire years were associated with drought. Drought intensity also influenced fire extent and the most widespread fires occurred in the driest years. Years with widespread fires were also preceded by wet conditions 3 years before the fire. Widespread fires were also associated with phase changes of the PDO, with the most widespread burns occurring when the phase changed from warm (positive) to cold (negative) conditions. Annual SOI and fire frequency or extent were not associated in our study. At decadal time scales, burning was more widespread during decades that were dryer and characterized by La Nina and negative PDO conditions. Interannual and interdecadal fire-climate relationships were not stable over time. From 1700 to 1775 there was no interannual relationship between drought, PDO, and fire frequency or extent. However, from 1775 to 1850, widespread fires were associated with dry years preceded by wet years. This period also had the strongest association between fire extent and the PDO. In contrast, fire-climate associations at interdecadal time scales were stronger in the earlier period than in the later period. The change from strong interdecadal to strong interannual climate influence was associated with a breakdown in decadal scale constructive relationships between PDO and SOI. Main conclusions Climate strongly influenced pre-settlement pine forest fire regimes in northern Sierra Nevada. Both interannual and interdecadal climatic variation regulated conditions conducive to fire activity, and longer term changes in fire frequency and extent correspond with climate-mediated changes observed in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The sensitivity of fire regimes to shifts in modes of climatic variability suggests that climate was a key regulator of pine forest ecosystem structure and dynamics before EuroAmerican settlement. An understanding of pre-EuroAmerican fire-climate relationships may provide useful insights into how fire activity in contemporary forests may respond to future climatic variation.

J	Hamilton, SK; Sippel, SJ; Melack, JM				Hamilton, SK; Sippel, SJ; Melack, JM			Seasonal inundation patterns in two large savanna floodplains of South America: the Llanos de Moxos (Bolivia) and the Llanos del Orinoco (Venezuela and Colombia)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Inundation patterns in two of the largest savanna floodplains of South America were studied by analysis of the 37-GHz polarization difference observed by the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (Nimbus-7 satellite). Flooded area was estimated at monthly intervals for January 1979 through to August 1987 using mixing models that account for the major landscape units with distinctive microwave emission characteristics. Results are presented separately for five subregions in each of the two floodplain regions to show the spatial as well as temporal variability in inundation patterns. The total area inundated during the 9 years varied between 2069 and 78 460 km(2) in the Llanos de Moxos (also spelled as Mojos; median area, 23 383 km(2)) and 1278 and 105 454 km(2) in the Llanos del Orinoco (median, 25 374 km(2)) not including the open-water area of permanent takes and river channels. The correlation between flooded area and river stage was used to extend the inundation records over a 30-year period in the Moxos (1967-97) and a 58-year period (1927-85) in the Orinoco. Interannual variability in inundation is greater in the Moxos than the Orinoco. Comparison of these data, however, with a previously published analysis of the Pantanal wetland shows that inundation patterns in these two floodplain regions are not as variable across years as they are in the Pantanal.

Predicting the future distributions of Calomicrus apicalis Demaison, 1891 (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) under climate change	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION												Climate change is one of the main drivers of the changes in the distribution of species in the twenty-first century. Thus, the number of studies on the prediction of the effects of climate change on species is increasing day by day. Calomicrus apicalis is a pest leaf beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) species which only distributes in Cyprus, Syria, and Turkey. The species causes important damages especially on Taurus cedar (Cedrus libani) stands of Turkish forests and also feeds on Pinus brutia, P. nigra, and P. sylvestris trees. This study aims to model the current and future (2041-2060 and 2081-2100) distribution of this pest species according to SSP2 and SSP5 emission scenarios given by the MIROC6 climate change model. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling was used to determine the current and future potential distribution of the species. Also, post-modeling analyses were performed to reveal the changes in both spatial distribution and niche suitability of the area (according to presence probability classes) between present and future distribution ranges of the species. The most important bioclimatic variables which shape the range of the species were precipitation of driest quarter, temperature seasonality, and precipitation of driest month. As a result of the study, it is determined that the current distribution of the species could be wider than its known distribution range. Most of all, the whole of the Aegean Region is a highly suitable area for the species. According to our models, the distribution of the species under climate change will expand toward the Sivas Province from the present to 2041-2060 and 2081-2100. However, the distribution of the species will shrink considerably from 2041-2060 to 2081-2100 because of changing climate. According to the change analysis, highly suitable areas for the species will decrease by around 36% and 15% by 2081-2100 according to the SSP2 and SSP5 scenarios, respectively. Although the distribution of the species will shrink in the future, the species should be observed up to 2041-2060 because it will distribute more widely in this period (current to 2041-2060) and cause damages in weakened trees due to drought stress.					; Orucu, Omer/AAK-6034-2020; şen, ismail/AAY-1049-2021; ORUCU, Omer K./AAK-6034-2020	sen, ismail/0000-0002-9905-3537; ORUCU, Omer K./0000-0002-2162-7553													1861-3829	1861-3837				APR	2022	129	2					325	337		10.1007/s41348-022-00579-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41348-022-00579-7		FEB 2022											WOS:000753246900001

In this study, we investigated the long-term dynamic patterns of the Tonle Sap Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Mekong River Basin, using a series of hydrological data and remote sensing images between 2000 and 2020. Our findings revealed a significant decline in the annual average water level of the lake by approximately 2.1 m over 20 years, accompanied by an annual average reduction in surface area of about 1400 km2. The Tonle Sap Lake exhibited episodic declines in water level and surface area, characterized by the absence of flooding during the flood season and increasing aridity during the dry season. Furthermore, the shoreline of the lake has significantly advanced towards the lake in the northwestern and southern regions during the dry season, primarily due to sedimentation -induced shallowing of the lake edge depth and decreased water levels. In contrast, lake shorelines in the eastern region remained relatively stable due to the constructed embankments for the protection of the cultivated farmland. While the seasonal fluctuations of the Tonle Sap Lake are regulated by regional precipitation in the Mekong River Basin, the prolonged shrinking of the lake can be mainly ascribed to intensive anthropogenic activities. The interception of dams along the upper Mekong River has resulted in a decrease in the inflow to Tonle Sap Lake, exacerbating its shrinkage. Moreover, there are minor impacts from agricultural land expansion and irrigation on the lake. This study highlights the driving forces behind the evolution of Tonle Sap Lake, providing valuable information for lake managers to develop strategies aimed at conserving and restoring the ecological integrity of the Tonle Sap Lake.

In drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), various methods have been proposed to remove pesticide residues. This study was designed with the objectives of monitoring the occurrence and seasonal variations of pesticides in the output of drinking water treatment plants in two Northern provinces of Iran, Gilan and Golestan, and identifying their human health risks. Seventeen pesticide residues from different chemical structures were determined by using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The results showed that only Alachlor, Diazinon, Fenitrothion, Malathion, and Chlorpyrifos were detected. The pesticide concentrations ranged from ND to 405.3 ng/L and were higher in the first half-year period. The total non-carcinogenic human health risks was in safe range for infants, children, and adults (HI < 1). The carcinogenic human health risks of Alachlor for infants, children, and adults were in the range of 4.3 x 10(-7) to 1.3 x 10(-6), 2.0 x 10(-7) to 9.6 x 10(-7), and 1.1 x 10(-7) to 5.5 x 10(-7), respectively. These values do not pose health risks for adults and children, but may present a possible cancer risk for infants in two DWTPs of Golestan. In conclusion, considering the possibility of exposure to these pesticides through other routes, simultaneously, it is suggested to carry out a study that examines the level of risk by considering all exposure routes. We also propose stricter regulations for the sale and use of pesticides in Iran.

Zacarias			Carbon sources of fish in an Amazonian floodplain lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In a tropical floodplain lake in central Amazon (L. Camaleao), we investigated seasonal shifts in primary carbon sources for commercially important fish species over an hydrological cycle. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope and stomach content analyses were conducted to investigate the feeding preferences of six species with different feeding habits: Cichla monoculus (piscivorous species), Schizodon fasciatus (herbivorous), Prochilodus nigricans (detritivorous), and the omnivorous species Triportheus angulatus, Colossoma macropomum and Mylossoma duriventre. Stomach content and isotopic analyses exhibited a high seasonal variation for four out of the six species. The dominant food items were fruits and seeds, plant material, zooplankton and aquatic and terrestrial insects. Over the hydrological cycle, C-3 plants were the major carbon source for all fish species. In addition, seston and aquatic C-4 macrophytes were very important carbon sources for most species. Our findings underpin the complex trophic linkages between floodplain lakes and the aquatic terrestrial transition zone as postulated by the Flood Pulse Concept.

J	Liao, JJ; Shen, GZ; Dong, L				Liao, Jingjuan; Shen, Guozhuang; Dong, Lei			Biomass estimation of wetland vegetation in Poyang Lake area using ENVISAT advanced synthetic aperture radar data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Biomass estimation of wetlands plays a role in understanding dynamic changes of the wetland ecosystem. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, with an area of about 3000 km(2). The lake's wetland ecosystem has a significant impact on leveraging China's environmental change. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are a good choice for biomass estimation during rainy and dry seasons in this region. In this paper, we discuss the neural network algorithms (NNAs) to retrieve wetland biomass using the alternating-polarization ENVISAT advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) data. Two field measurements were carried out coinciding with the satellite overpasses through the hydrological cycle in April to November. A radiative transfer model of forest canopy, the Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS) model, was modified to fit to herbaceous wetland ecosystems. With both ASAR and MIMICS simulations as input data, the NNA-estimated biomass was validated with ground-measured data. This study indicates the capability of NNA combined with a modified MIMICS model to retrieve wetland biomass from SAR imagery. Finally, the overall biomass of Poyang Lake wetland vegetation has been estimated. It reached a level of 1.09 x 10(9), 1.86 x 10(8), and 9.87 x 10(8) kg in April, July, and November 2007, respectively. (C) The Authors.

J	Hart, RC				Hart, R. C.			Zooplankton biomass to chlorophyll ratios in relation to trophic status within and between ten South African reservoirs: Causal inferences, and implications for biomanipulation	WATER SA												Rising eutrophication in South African reservoirs is of major concern, leading to the consideration of top-down biomanipulation as a management option - reducing zooplankton-eating fish to sustain zooplankton grazing pressure and thus restrict autotrophic plankton that proliferate with nutrient increases. The biomass ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton (ZB/PB) is used as an index of the likely value of biomanipulation to achieve this outcome, but values have not been explored for South African systems. Using chlorophyll (Chl) as a surrogate for PB, available ZB/Chl data are assembled for the first time for ten reservoirs of three types (minerally-turbid systems, oligo/mesotrophic clear water systems, and eutrophic/hypertrophic systems), and the results are discussed in relation to a generalised conceptual model proposed. With the exception of one minerally-turbid system, ZB/Chl values decline quasi-exponentially with rising chlorophyll within individual reservoirs. Conversely, between individual systems, median (or mean) values of ZB/Chl conversely increase rather than decline with rising trophic status - broadly contradicting observations reported elsewhere. Underlying causal reasons for the observed pattern and its implications for biomanipulation are considered. This assessment evaluates: the negative impacts of general declines in food quality that stem from rising eutrophication on zooplankton feeding ability and resulting seasonal changes in ZB and community structure; prospects of food sources other than living autochthonous autotrophs in sustaining ZB between systems; and inferences about fish predation pressure on zooplankton, derived from empirical data regarding the large body sizes of species and individuals of Daphnia that occur in the reservoirs. Observed increases in median ZB/Chl ratios with rising nutrient status are consistent with the inference that obligate visual zooplanktivorous fishes are scarce or absent, particularly in eutrophic reservoirs, suggesting that biomanipulative management is unlikely to assist in controlling the consequences of nutrient enrichment in local reservoirs.																			0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	2011	37	4					513	522		10.4314/wsa.v37i4.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v37i4.9													WOS:000296882200009

Seasonal Changes in the Vertical Distribution of Rotifers in a Eutrophic Shallow Lake with Contrasting States of Clear and Turbid Water	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES												Maria C. Claps, Nestor A. Gabellone, and Hernan H. Benitez (2011) Seasonal changes in the vertical distribution of rotifers in a eutrophic shallow lake with contrasting states of clear and turbid water. Zoological Studies 50(4): 454-465. Monthly zooplankton samples were taken from a shallow Argentinean lake in 19971998, and spatiotemporal changes in rotifers in the water column were examined. The most abundant and frequent species were Brachionus calyciflorus, B. caudatus, B. havanaensis, Keratella tropica, Filinia longiseta, and Polyarthra vulgaris. These perennial species are considered to be common in eutrophic waters, are eurytopic, and are widely distributed. The phytoplankton composition, competition for food with other grazers, and predation pressure, plus the occurrence of different periods including a turbid phase, a phase with coverage of submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton pectinatus), and a flooding phase, defined the annual planktonic rotifer succession in the lake. Small-scale vertical distributions of rotifers in this homothermal lake were related to both biotic and abiotic forces. The presence of macrophytes favored an increase in planktonic-rotifer densities along with a specific richness associated with the possibility of refuge, the incorporation of littoral species, and food diversification. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/50.4/454.pdf						Claps, Maria/0000-0002-7459-3238													1021-5506	1810-522X				JUL	2011	50	4					454	465																WOS:000293257000007

Seasonal dynamics of a large, shallow lake, laguna Chascomus: The rote of light limitation and other physical variables	LIMNOLOGICA					3rd Argentinean Congress on Limnology	NOV, 2005	Chascomus, ARGENTINA					The most conspicuous waterbodies in the Pampa region of Argentina are the so-called "lagunas". A typical Pampean laguna may be described as a relatively large (100+ha), permanent, shallow lake. Here, we report the dynamics of laguna Chascomus, sampled weekly, from April 2001 to June 2003. During the period, the lakes experienced three consecutive floods waves that affected the concentration of major ions and the optical signature of the dissolved organic matter. Despite these hydrological alterations, laguna Chascomus was permanently limited by light. Transparency was to a great extent controlled by the incident photosynthetic available radiation irradiance. We hypothesize that wind contributes to the permanent mixing of the lake, as well as to lessen the sedimentation losses of photoautotrophs. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Burns, CW				Burns, Carolyn W.			Predictors of invasion success by Daphnia species: influence of food, temperature and species identity	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Non-indigenous North American Daphnia 'pulex' has recently invaded lakes and reservoirs in South Island, New Zealand, that formerly contained only native Daphnia carinata. New Zealand is characterised by a wide range of freshwater ecosystems and low species diversity of planktonic crustaceans, particularly Cladocera. The potential success of a species to invade and establish in a new community is likely to be predicted more accurately when reproductive response norms and fitness of key resident species, as well as the non-indigenous species, have been established under a range of relevant environmental conditions. Based on the results of experiments to test aspects of reproduction and fitness of the invader, D. 'pulex', and D. carinata when grown together at a range of relevant temperatures (8-23 A degrees C) and related photoperiods, I predict the species-specific potential of D. 'pulex' to be dispersed and colonise New Zealand lentic habitats, and the potential of D. carinata to persist with the invader in these habitats. Larger population densities of D. 'pulex' compared to D. carinata at higher temperatures and food level, and larger densities of D. carinata at low temperatures, imply a potential for both species to coexist in New Zealand lakes, facilitated by seasonal succession; increased water temperature and nutrient input associated with climate and land use changes appear likely to promote the wider establishment of D. 'pulex', with both negative and positive implications for the conservation and management of New Zealand's freshwater ecosystems.																			1387-3547	1573-1464				APR	2013	15	4					859	869		10.1007/s10530-012-0335-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-012-0335-5													WOS:000316200700013

Mapping snow cover and snow depth across the Lake Limnopolar watershed on Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, Maritime Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Few parts of Antarctica are not permanently covered in ice. The retreat of the ice sheet from Byers Peninsula on western Livingston Island, Maritime Antarctica, has provided a new area of seasonal snow cover. Snow surveys were conducted in late November 2008 at the time of peak accumulation across the 1 km(2) Lake Limnopolar watershed. Topographic variables were derived from a digital elevation model to determine the variables controlling the presence or absence of snow and the distribution of snow depth. Classification with binary regression trees showed that wind related variables dominated the presence and depth of snow. The product of the sine of aspect and the sine of slope was the first variable in both regression trees. Density profiles were also measured and illustrated a relatively homogeneous snowpack over space at peak snow accumulation.

Six temperate shallow lakes from the Pampa Plain (Argentina) were sampled over an annual cycle, and two fingerprinting techniques were applied: a 16S rDNA analysis was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles, and a 16S23S internally transcribed spacer region analysis was conducted by means of automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) profiles. Our results show that the steady state that characterized the different shallow lakes played a major role in structuring the community: the composition of free-living bacteria differed significantly between clear-vegetated, inorganic-turbid and phytoplankton-turbid shallow lakes. The state of the system was more important in determining these patterns than seasonality, geographical location or degree of hydrological connectivity. Moreover, this strong environmental control was particularly evident in the pattern observed in one of the lakes, which shifted from a clear to a turbid state over the course of the study. This lake showed a directional selection of species from a typical clear-like to a turbid-like community. The combined DGGE/ARISA approach revealed not only broad patterns among different alternative steady states, but also more subtle differences within different regimes.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; Llames, Maria Eugenia/0000-0001-6984-8016													1758-2229					APR	2013	5	2					310	321		10.1111/1758-2229.12020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12020								23584972					WOS:000315851200014

The section consists of 1,387 m of continental fluvial deposits. On the basis of fluvial architecture analysis, the sedimentary paleoenvironment was reinterpreted and the results were related to the paleocommunities and the poleoclimate conditions in which they may have developed. On the basis of stratigraphic and sedimentological features, we introduce new paleoenvironmental interpretations: the strata are related to an intermediate class between low and high sinuosity rivers forming a wandering sand-gravel fluvial system with small lagoons. Channel and overbank deposits can he distinguished within this river system: Accumulations within channels are composed of gravels bars and sandy bedforms, whereas overbank deposits are represented by crevasse channels, small crevasse channels, and floodplain deposits. In the floodplains, lagoons and marshes can be recognized in which aquatic and marsh communities developed, whereas during the (by season, or during longer city intervals, suggested by desiccation cracks and thin gypsum beds, savannas and grasslands would had developed. The coasts of the lakes and marshes, which intermingled with fluvial riverbeds, were inhabited by hygrophilous communities and woodland. The aquatic and marsh paleocommunities and the hygrophilic forests were stable and developed under a hot and humid, tropical to subtropical climate, which is also indicated by the development of clay mineral assemblages of Mite, smectite and kaolinite. These paleoclimatic conditions occurred at a time when global climatic changes led to drier conditions and to the establishment of xeric vegetation. The paleocommunities defined for the Palo Pintado Formation contain members of various current phytogeographic provinces from northern Argentina and other South American regions. although the modern communities had not been established at that lime, and the fossil ones can be considered as their predecessors.																			1026-8774					APR	2011	28	1					161	174																WOS:000289586600012

The maximum Total Filtered Hg (T-FHg) concentrations in the floodplain lakes (28 to 52 pmol L-1) coincide with the maximum T-FHg concentrations of the Amazon River and are measured during the flooding period. The lowest T-FHg values (3 to 5 pmol L-1) are observed during the flood peak of the mainstream, during the rainy season, when waters are diluted by the local rainfall. In this system, Hg is mainly transported in the particulate phase, confirmed by elevated values of the Hg partition coefficient (4.77 < K-d (Hg) < 5.83 Lkg(-1)). The highest Total Particulate Hg (T-PHg) concentrations (47-478 pmol L-1) in the lakes are measured during the dry season when they are isolated from the mainstream. This enrichment is due to the elevated TSS content associated to the re-suspension of the bottom sediments by the wind action and the bioturbation in shallow water lakes. In the flooded system, the lakes show different geochemical characteristics that control the Hg distribution and partition. In the white water (WW) lakes, characterized by oxidative neutral waters and highest TSS contents (till 2041 mg L-1), the T-PHg is associated to the particulate organic matter mainly during the dry season, while the T-FHg and T-FMn concentrations are correlated. In the black water (BW) lakes that show reductive pH conditions and lowest TSS load (2 to 52 mg L-1), P-iron and T-PHg display a positive relationship whereas the redox conditions favor the desorption of Hg from the particulate to the filtered phase. The mercury mass budget estimated in this study confirms that the Curuai floodplain system acts as a particulate mercury trap, with a net storage of particulate Hg of 150 kg PHg year(-1).

Seasonal correlations of elemental and ω3 PUFA composition of seston and dominant phytoplankton species in a eutrophic Siberian Reservoir	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The elemental and fatty acid composition of seston was studied for 3 years, from May to October, in a small Reservoir. Under comparatively low C:P ratio, multivariate canonical analysis revealed no straightforward simple correlations between phosphorus and single omega 3 PUFA species, but complex significant interaction between elemental composition (stoichiometry) of seston and total sestonic omega 3 PUFA as a whole. Since sestonic C, P and N were found to originate mostly from phytoplankton, the contents of particulate elements and PUFA were attributed to single species in periods of their pronounced dominance. Phytoplankton species of genera of Stephanodiscus, Peridinium, Gomphosphaeria, Planktothrix and Anabaena in periods of their pronounced dominance had relatively constant species-specific elemental and PUFA composition. Phytoplankton species significantly differed in their elemental and PUFA composition, as well as in ratios of C:N, N:P, PUFA:P and partly C:P that indicate food quality for zooplankton. Hence, there were no phytoplankton species of clearly high or low nutritional value. All of phytoplankters, or at least detritus, that originated from them, may meet specific elemental and biochemical requirements of specific groups of zooplankton. Dividing phytoplankton on basis of their elemental and biochemical composition, i.e., nutrition quality, into large taxa (cyanobacteria, diatoms, etc.) appeared to be too coarse for assessing nutritional value for zooplankton.

In this study, the seasonal changes of acidophilic communities and their roles in elemental cycling in an AMD lake (pH similar to 3.0) in China were analyzed through metagenomics. The results showed eukaryotic algae thrived in the lake, and Coccomyxa was dominant in January (38.1%) and May (33.9%), while Chlorella in July (9.5%). The extensive growth of Chlamydomonas in December (22.7%) resulted in an ultrahigh chlorophyll a concentration (587 mu g/L), providing abundant organic carbon for the ecosystem. In addition, the iron-oxidizing and nitrogen-fixing bacterium Ferrovum contributed to carbon fixation. Ammonia oxidation likely occurred in the acidic lake, as was revealed by archaea Ca. Nitrosotalea. To gain a competitive advantage in the nutrient-poor environment, some acidophiles exhibited facultative characteristics, e.g. the most abundant bacterium Acidiphilium utilized both organic and inorganic carbon, and obtained energy from organic matter, inorganic sulfur, and sunlight simultaneously. It was suggested that sunlight, rather than chemical energy of reduced iron -sulfur was the major driver of elemental cycling in the AMD lake. The results are beneficial to the development of bioremediation strategies for AMD.

The pelagic rotifer assemblage of Lake Alchichica is simple and comprised by two species, both new and most likely endemic: Brachionus sp. Mexico (related to B. plicatilis) and Hexarthra sp. (related to H. jenkinae). Similar low species richness and composition are found in other saline lakes associated with salinity. Rotifers in Lake Alchichica were an irregular component of the zooplankton community. Rotifers' overall abundance (471 +/- 1211 ind m(-2)) and biomass (24 +/- 63 mg DW m(-2)) were low; Brachionus sp. Mexico and Hexarthra sp. contributed similarly to the annual mean abundance (54% and 46%, respectively) and biomass (53% and 47%, respectively). Abundance and biomass were tightly coupled, but there was no regular pattern in their seasonal dynamics. When co-existing, Brachionus sp. Mexico showed a higher abundance than Hexarthra sp. The dominant (approximate to 80%) phytoplankton biomass in Lake Alchichica, the large (35-63 mu m) diatom Cyclotella alchichicana, is inedible for rotifers, thus rotifers most probably relied only on nanophytoplankton (<= 20 mu m). Seasonal and interannual differences in rotifers seem related to food availability (oligotrophy) and probably to biotic interactions (e.g., competition). Rotifer abundance and biomass values in 1998-2001 went down to 12.5% in 2013-2016. Climate change and stochastics events leading to pulses of the rotifers' food, and biotic interactions seem to be the most plausible explanation.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021	Fernandez, Rocio/0000-0002-5826-0804; Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; Oseguera Perez, Luis Alberto/0000-0001-8405-9656; 														1424-2818				FEB	2022	14	2							113	10.3390/d14020113	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14020113													WOS:000763985700001

Mapping Modern Climate Change in the Selenga River Basin	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY												The climate change in the Selenga River basin observed over the period from 1961 to 2018 is considered. The WorldClim dataset and the GHCN-Daily global weather station database are used to map mean and extreme climatic characteristics. These maps are included in the geoinformation system for hydroecological safety in the Selenga River basin under development. An interpolation technique that takes into account the dependence of temperature and precipitation extremes on their average long-term values is used for mapping extreme indices. It was found that in contrast to most of Russia, average annual temperature in the Selenga River basin increases mainly due to the warm season. At the same time, the amount of precipitation decreases, which leads to the increasing risk of droughts. A substantial increase in the number of days with maximum temperature >= 25 degrees C, the number of consecutive dry days, as well as the frequency of droughts, is revealed. It is most pronounced in the south of the basin.

The general form and trend of metal uptake at different stations in the gill and muscle tissue was Cu > Ni > Pb. The results of the study of metal uptake in both algae showed that the uptake of all three metals was higher in Padina species (Pb < Cu < Ni). The estimated daily intake (EDI), estimated weekly intake (EWI), allowable fish consumption rate limit (CRlim), and the target hazard quotients (THQ) for the consumption of this fish were also calculated. It was found that the concentration of heavy metals in the edible parts of the fish did not exceed the permissible limits proposed by the WHO, MAFF, JECFA, and NHMRC for human consumption, but the Ni concentration was higher than standard. The consumer risk indexes for non-cancerous diseases due to all metals were lower than standard. Also, the total risk index (HI) in this study was 0.065.

In this study we analyzed the taxonomic and functional composition and diversity of these communities across all seasons and hydrological phases. The study was conducted in a floodplain lake, a part of the large natural Danube floodplain, from February 2015 to September 2016. We found that higher temperature and hydrologically stable conditions during the lake isolation phase, when a high amount of suspended food is available, result in the highest ciliate abundances and dominance of relatively large suspension-feeding ciliates, mainly peritrichs, which could serve as good bioindicators for detecting disturbances in river-floodplain ecosystems. During the flow pulse phase, associated with lower temperatures, and during the phase of extreme floods, when the availability of suspended food was largely reduced, small surface-feeding ciliates prevailed in the periphyton. Further, while the total ciliate abundance was the lowest, the highest taxonomic and functional diversity was found, especially during an intermediate level of hydrological connectivity (flow pulse). Our results confirm the importance of different levels of hydrological connectivity for maintaining biodiversity in riverine floodplains and add to a growing awareness of the need to preserve the natural hydrological regimes of large rivers.

Space-based passive microwave soil moisture retrievals and the correction for a dynamic open water fraction	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The large observation footprint of low-frequency satellite microwave emissions complicates the interpretation of near-surface soil moisture retrievals. While the effect of sub-footprint lateral heterogeneity is relatively limited under unsaturated conditions, open water bodies (if not accounted for) cause a strong positive bias in the satellite-derived soil moisture retrieval. This bias is generally assumed static and associated with large, continental lakes and coastal areas. Temporal changes in the extent of smaller water bodies as small as a few percent of the sensor footprint size, however, can cause significant and dynamic biases. We analysed the influence of such small open water bodies on near-surface soil moisture products derived from actual (non-synthetic) data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) for three areas in Oklahoma, USA. Differences between on-ground observations, model estimates and AMSR-E retrievals were related to dynamic estimates of open water fraction, one retrieved from a global daily record based on higher frequency AMSR-E data, a second derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and a third through inversion of the radiative transfer model, used to retrieve soil moisture. The comparison demonstrates the presence of relatively small areas (< 0.05) of open water in or near the sensor footprint, possibly in combination with increased, below-critical vegetation density conditions (optical density < 0.8), which contribute to seasonally varying biases in excess of 0.2 (m(3) m(-3)) soil water content. These errors need to be addressed, either through elimination or accurate characterisation, if the soil moisture retrievals are to be used effectively in a data assimilation scheme.

THE PROGRESSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES DURING THE ONSET OF THE PALEOCENE-EOCENE THERMAL MAXIMUM (NEW JERSEY COASTAL PLAIN)	AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Chemostratigraphic and biostratigraphic studies of Paleocene-Eocene boundary sequences in the New Jersey Coastal Plain reveal that the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) corresponds to a basin-wide, thick clay unit. Benthic foraminifera have been studied at low resolution, but we present the first high-resolution benthic foraminiferal data and paleoecologic interpretations of the more landward Wilson Lake and more seaward Bass River drill sites. Graphic correlation allows refinement of the site-to-site correlation, providing insight in the succession and timing of environmental changes associated with the onset of the PETM. Uppermost Paleocene glauconitic sandy strata were deposited at very low sedimentation rates (Bass River similar to 1 cm/kyr and Wilson Lake similar to 0.1 cm/kyr). Deposition occurred in stable, well-oxygenated deep middle neritic (Wilson Lake,) to outer neritic environments (Bass River). No changes in benthic assemblages are associated with the start of the Apectodinium acme or the proposed pre-PETM sea surface temperature rise. The onset of the PETM, as characterized by the base of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE), is at the transition from glauconitic sands to silty clay, coinciding with a major benthic foraminiferal change towards a more outer neritic assemblage consisting of opportunistic taxa. The onset of the PETM is represented in a transitional fauna present in the updip Wilson Lake site (sedimentation rate similar to 16.9 cm/kyr), whereas the more downdip section (Bass River) contains a relatively condensed interval (sedimentation rate similar to 2.8 cm/kyr). In the record from the expanded Wilson Lake sequence, the start of a major sea level rise coincided with the onset of the CIE and preceded the establishment of the dysoxic eutrophic conditions in the earliest PETM as indicated by the low-diversity, opportunist dominated benthic foraminiferal assemblages. This low-diverse assemblage probably reflects the establishment of persistent stratification and subsequent dysoxic sea floor conditions. Increasing benthic diversity indicates a steady environmental recovery later in the PETM, during which seasonal dysoxic eutrophic conditions still created periodic stress for the benthic biota. Site-to-site correlation indicates an increase in sedimentation rates for this interval (Wilson Lake similar to >= 21.4 cm/kyr and Bass River similar to >= 10.0 cm/kyr), in association with high influxes of low-salinity tolerant dinoflagellates. Overall, benthic communities indicate no environmental changes prior to the PETM and the rapid development of a stratified water column during the PETM, leading to permanent dysoxic bottom water conditions, followed by a gradual decline in stratification and only seasonal dysoxia.

Investigations were conducted in a shallow, hypertrophic lake situated in the area of Polesie Lubelskie (Eastern Poland). Periphyton communities (algae, ciliates, small metazoa and chironomids) on both types of substratum were sampled monthly, from May to November of 2007. Water samples for chemical analysis were collected together with biological samples. We selected the group of ten environmental variables which are the most important in determining the habitat conditions in highly eutrophic lakes: temperature, Secchi disc visibility, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, periphytic chlorophyll-a, N-NO3, N-NH4, TP, P-PO4 and total organic carbon (TOC). The abundances of periphytic algae, ciliates, metazoa and chironomids were significantly affected by season and substrate. On natural substrata, in all studied months, periphyton communities showed higher abundances. The results of PCA analysis confirmed the distinction between periphyton communities on natural and artificial substrata. The Monte Carlo permutation test showed that the periphyton communities on common reed were the most significantly affected by temperature, N-NO3, Secchi disc visibility and TOC. The communities on artificial substrata were significantly influenced by temperature, P-PO4 and TOG. On natural substrata biomass of periphytic algae was significantly negatively correlated with abundances of all groups of potential grazers (ciliates, metazoa, chironomids). On artificial substrata the relations between components of periphytic food web were stronger; correlation coefficients between algae, protists and chironomids were significant at P<0.01. The results of analysis indicate that periphytic algae can play an important role as food source for higher trophic levels. These interactions are less significant on natural (reed) substrata, where algae during their growth may use nutrients releasing by plants. On inert substrata intensive feeding activity of grazers (ciliates, metazoan, chironomids) can markedly reduce algal biomass and affect their taxonomic composition.					; Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/T-7469-2018	Mieczan, Tomasz/0000-0003-2839-1798; Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/0000-0001-5328-6944													1129-5767	1723-8633					2012	71	2					279	290		10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e30	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e30													WOS:000313475300005

In this paper, we sampled six types of wetlands representing different kinds of land utilisation around the TaiHu Lake Basin in southeast China. An outdoor computerized microcosm was set up in May 2008 to simulate climate scenarios of ambient temperature (control) and a warmed ambient temperature (+5 degrees C) using a novel minute-scale daily and seasonal temperature manipulation technology. The 18-month incubation indicated that warming impaired the ecological sink of sediment (fixing P from porewater) while strengthening the role of the ecological source, moreover, the rate of P release from sediment into porewater (19-113% for total phosphorus) was much stronger than from top sediment into overlying water. Warming enhanced the activity of neutral and alkaline phosphatases for P-deficient wetland sediments and neutral phosphatases for P-rich sediments, at the 14th month of incubation. A significant increase in total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) occurred under warming in sediments with relatively low levels of PLFAs, but bacterial abundance in the sediment biomass tended to decrease (18%) along with an increase (4.5%) of the fungi-to-bacteria ratio. The variations of carbon consumption and availability indicated by measured dissolved organic carbon in sediment may have contributed to P release from sediments to water.

The concentration of DOC increased sharply during the period of water and sediment regulation, which may promote the terrestrial DOC consumption by heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Water and sediment regulation provides an ideal condition for the study of terrestrial DOC consumption by heterotrophic bacterioplankton when terrestrial DOC increases sharply in rainy season, which may help to seek the fates of terrestrial DOC in the estuaries and coasts. In this study, the concentration and stable isotope of DOC, the biomass, growth, and respiration of heterotrophic bacterioplankton were determined. By the study, we found both average percent contribution of terrestrial DOC to the DOC pool and Contribution of terrestrial DOC to the carbon composition of heterotrophic bacterioplankton decreased as distance from the river mouth increased offshore, which was deceased from (39.2 +/- 4.0)%, (37.5 +/- 4.3)% to (30.3 +/- 3.9)%, (28.1 +/- 3.9)% respectively. 255-484 mu g C/(L.d) terrestrial DOC was consumed by heterotrophic bacterioplankton. And 29%-45% terrestrial DOC consumed by heterotrophic bacterioplankton releasing as CO2 by respiration.

Seasonal flooding, instream habitat structure and fish assemblages in the Mulgrave River, north-east Queensland: towards a new conceptual framework for understanding fish-habitat dynamics in small tropical rivers	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Strong relationships between seasonal flooding, instream habitat structure and fish assemblages have been well documented in large tropical rivers (e. g. the flood pulse concept). However, the mechanics of these relationships are likely to differ substantially in smaller coastal rivers, such as those in Costa Rica, south-east Brazil and Australia's Wet Tropics. These systems typically feature steep upland streams with short, deeply incised lowland channels and poorly connected floodplains. This hypothesis was investigated by documenting spatial and temporal variation in fish-habitat relationships in the Mulgrave River, north-east Queensland. Sampling was conducted at four lowland sites under a range of flow conditions, from dry-season baseflows to a one-in-ten-year flood. Longitudinal environmental gradients and fine-scale habitat patches were important in regulating fish assemblage structure during the dry season. However, high wet-season flows, constrained by the deep channel, acted as disturbances rather than gentle flood-pulses. In particular, the mobilisation of bed sediments led to scouring of aquatic vegetation and a dramatic reduction in habitat heterogeneity. Seasonal movements of fish led to significant changes in assemblage structure - from a community dominated by Neosilurus ater, Hypseleotris compressa, Awaous acritosus and Redigobius bikolanus during the dry season, to one dominated by Nematalosa erebi, Ambassis agrammus and Glossamia aprion during the wet season. Based on these observations, together with information from the literature, a conceptual model of fish-habitat dynamics is presented that is better suited to small tropical rivers than those developed in larger systems with expansive floodplains.					; Pearson, Richard/GQH-2760-2022; Rayner, Thomas/ISS-1183-2023	Pearson, Richard/0000-0001-6047-031X; 													1323-1650						2008	59	2					97	116		10.1071/MF07129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF07129													WOS:000253530500001

Assessment and evaluation of metal contents in sediment and water samples within an urban watershed: an analysis of anthropogenic impacts on sediment and water quality in Central Brazil	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of metals in sediments and surface water within the Lago Paranoa catchment in Central Brazil, and to evaluate metal enrichments due to anthropogenic activities. Concentrations of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, Ti and Zn were analyzed in sediment samples from sediment sources under different land uses, in alluvial sediment profiles, and in water samples. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the impact of different land use types on metal concentrations in source sediments. The anthropogenic impact of different land uses on metal concentrations in sediments was quantified by the calculation of enrichment factors, using the local geological background as reference. The data showed that different anthropogenic activities are related to specific metal enrichments in source and alluvial sediments. Particularly urban areas with high-density block development were characterized by higher enrichments of Cd, Cr, Pb, Sr and Zn compared to the local background values. Sediments from agricultural areas had higher concentrations of Cr, Cu and Ni compared to urban areas, which is caused by higher contents of clay and not due to human impact. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb in surface water samples of the main rivers discharging into Lago Paranoa were very low. The values of Al, Fe, Mn, Sr and Zn differed between the sub-catchments and showed seasonal variation. Metal concentrations depended substantially on terrestrial inputs from anthropogenic and natural sources. The analysis of effluent water samples indicated that there is a temporary metal input into the lake from the two wastewater treatment plants, which might have caused metal enrichments in sediments and water. The regression analyses showed that there is a strong correlation between metal concentrations in alluvial sediments and corresponding water samples, as well as between metal accumulation in the alluvial sediments and shares of urban areas in the sub-catchment.

However, only few studies have assessed the effect of climate change on environmental toxic contaminants in urban lakes. In this research, response of several toxic contaminants in twelve urban lakes in Beijing, China, to the seasonal variations in climatic factors was studied. Fluorides, volatile phenols, arsenic, selenium, and other water quality parameters were analyzed monthly from 2009 to 2012. Multivariate statistical methods including principle component analysis, cluster analysis, and multiple regression analysis were performed to study the relationship between contaminants and climatic factors including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. Fluoride and arsenic concentrations in most urban lakes exhibited a significant positive correlation with temperature/precipitation, which is mainly caused by rainfall induced diffuse pollution. A negative correlation was observed between volatile phenols and temperature/precipitation, and this could be explained by their enhanced volatilization and biodegradation rates caused by higher temperature. Selenium did not show a significant response to climatic factor variations, which was attributed to low selenium contents in the lakes and soils. Moreover, the response degrees of contaminants to climatic variations differ among lakes with different contamination levels. On average, temperature/precipitation contributed to 8%, 15%, and 12% of the variations in volatile phenols, arsenic, and fluorides, respectively. Beijing is undergoing increased temperature and heavy rainfall frequency during the past five decades. This study suggests that water quality related to fluoride and arsenic concentrations of most urban lakes in Beijing is becoming worse under this climate change trend.

Colonial waterbird site occupancy dynamics reflect variation in colony site environments in the US Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Colonies of breeding waterbirds are salient biological features of many of the world's great lakes. Globally, status of colonial waterbird populations ranges from declining and in need of conservation to maintain their roles in aquatic ecosystems, to "overabundant" and managed to reduce human-wildlife conflict; both ends of this spectrum are observed in the North American Great Lakes. Conservation and management of colonial waterbirds should rely on knowledge of colony site use dynamics because the best approach may vary depending on the frequency with which historical colony sites are abandoned and new sites colonized. The goal of this study was to understand how site use dynamics are influenced by the physical and avian social environment, using the Great Lakes Colonial Waterbird Survey as a source of breeding-season site occupancy records. This study is the first to apply community occupancy modeling techniques to colonial waterbirds. Model parameter estimates were generated through a Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Sites with large waterbird colonies and those not susceptible to flooding were most likely to persist as breeding locations into the next survey period, and thus should be prioritized for conservation and management. Additionally, the model demonstrated that co-nester presence was positively related to persistence probabilities, while relationships between colonization probabilities and co-nester presence ranged from positive to negative for different focal species. Finally, species-specific responses to presence of other species and to environmental influences were apparent; knowledge of this relationship variability should be incorporated into management strategies to achieve optimal outcomes.

Seawater intrusion into groundwater aquifer through a coastal lake - complex interaction characterised by water isotopes 2H and 18O	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												The present study investigates the complex interactions among surface waters, groundwaters and a coastal lake in northeastern Greece, using their stable isotopic composition (O-18, H-2) in combination with hydrogeological and hydrochemical data. Seasonal and spatial trends of water isotopes were studied and revealed that all water bodies in the study area interact. It was also shown that the aquifer's increased salinity is not due to fossil water from past geological periods, but is attributed to brackish lake water intrusion into the aquifer induced by the extensive groundwater pumping for irrigation purposes. Quantification of the contribution of the lake to the aquifer was achieved using the simple dilution formula. The isotopic signatures of the seawater and the groundwaters are considerably different, so there is a very little possibility of direct seawater intrusion into the aquifer.					; Richnow, Hans/H-8523-2017	Gemitzi, Alexandra/0000-0002-8479-7955; Richnow, Hans/0000-0002-6144-4129													1025-6016	1477-2639				JAN 2	2014	50	1					74	87		10.1080/10256016.2013.823960	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2013.823960								24437571					WOS:000331361400006

M.; Sarvala, Jouko			Seasonal changes in the pelagic catch of two clupeid zooplanktivores in relation to the abundance of copepod zooplankton in the northern end of Lake Tanganyika	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Catches of clupeid fish were recorded twice a week from February 2007 to May 2008 in the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, and allocated to species (Stolothrissa tanganicae and Limnothrissa miodon) according to representative catch samples from ten artisanal lift-net fishing units. In each sample, clupeids were measured and weighed for length frequency analysis. Age was estimated from length growth curves based on otolith weight. Copepod zooplankton was sampled twice a month from February 2007 to January 2008. Peaks of copepod zooplankton were recorded in the rainy season, and there was overall a tight positive correlation between monthly rainfall and copepod biomass. The clupeids appeared in the catch at 30-50mm length when they were two-three (S. tanganicae) or three-four months old (L. miodon). For S. tanganicae, three catch peaks were due to cohorts born when copepod food was abundant, but one catch peak was due to a cohort which originated in the dry season when copepods were scarce. Likewise, two of the L. miodon cohorts giving rise to high catches likely originated from the rainy season when food was abundant, but two cohorts apparently originated from the dry season with low food conditions. The success of several cohorts of both clupeids therefore seems to be linked to rainfall and abundance of copepods, but sometimes strong cohorts could arise even under poor food conditions. Both species were recruited in the catch far before the age of maturity, making them vulnerable to overfishing.

Rostov., is a serious threat to cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) production worldwide and can result in 100% yield losses in affected environments. In the last decade, strains of the pathogen have overcome the resistance of commercial cultivars in the United States, and currently no cultivar has robust resistance to the disease. This lack of resistance has been especially problematic for cucumber growers seeking to capture the late-season market, when downy mildew is ubiquitous throughout Eastern and Great Lakes production environments. Our objectives were to identify sources of resistance genes and to introgress these genes into high-quality, high-yielding breeding material. Using the moderately resistant cucumber cultivars Marketmore 97 and Ivory Queen as well as the Cornell-developed cultivars Platinum and Salt & Pepper, we have developed lines with excellent disease resistance. In a trial of 27 lines that included Cornell breeding material and the most resistant cultivars and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) accessions identified in previous studies, the Cornell breeding line DMR-NY264 had the highest level of downy mildew resistance and the highest yields under disease pressure. In New York, plants of DMR-NY 264 produced fruit until frost without fungicide application.

J	Pickhardt, PC; Folt, CL; Chen, CY; Klaue, B; Blum, JD				Pickhardt, PC; Folt, CL; Chen, CY; Klaue, B; Blum, JD			Impacts of zooplankton composition and algal enrichment on the accumulation of mercury in an experimental freshwater food web	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												There is a well documented accumulation of mercury in fish to concentrations of concern for human consumption. Variation in fish Hg burden between lakes is often high and may result from differences in Hg transfer through lower levels of the food web where mercury is bioconcentrated to phytoplankton and transferred to herbivorous zooplankton. Prior research derived patterns of mercury accumulation in freshwater invertebrates from field collected animals. This study provides results from controlled mesocosm experiments comparing the effects of zooplankton composition, algal abundance, and the chemical speciation of mercury on the ability of zooplankton to accumulate mercury from phytoplankton and transfer that mercury to planktivores. Experiments were conducted in 550-L mesocosms across a gradient of algal densities manipulated by inorganic nutrient additions. Enriched, stable isotopes of organic ((CH3HgCl)-Hg-200) and inorganic ((HgCl2)-Hg-201) mercury were added to mesocosms and their concentrations measured in water, seston, and three common zooplankton species. After 2 weeks, monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentrations were two to three times lower in the two copepod species, Leptodiaptomus minutus and Mesocyclops edax than in the cladoceran, Daphnia mendotae. All three zooplankton species had higher MMHg concentrations in mesocosms with low versus high initial algal abundance. However, despite higher concentrations of inorganic mercury (Hg,) in seston from low nutrient mesocosms, there were no significant differences in the Hg-I accumulated by zooplankton across nutrient treatments. Bioaccumulation factors for MMHg in the plankton were similar to those calculated for plankton in natural lakes and a four-compartment (aqueous, seston, macrozooplankton, and periphyton/sediments) mass balance model after 21 days accounted for similar to 18% of the (CH3Hg)-Hg-200 and similar to 33% of the Hg-201 added. Results from our experiments corroborate results from field studies and suggest the importance of particular zooplankton herbivores (e.g., Daphnia) in the transfer of Hg to higher trophic levels in aquatic food webs.

Daily and seasonal temporal patterns, dissolved oxygen (DO) availability, inundation status (flooded or dry/partially flooded), water depth, and vegetation can affect the magnitude of carbon uptake or emissions, but the extent and interactive effects of these variables on carbon gas fluxes are poorly understood. We characterized the linkages between carbon fluxes and these environmental and temporal drivers at the Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve (OWC), OH. We measured diurnal gas flux patterns in an upstream side channel (called the cove) using chamber measurements at six sites (three vegetated and three non -vegetated). We sampled hourly from 7 AM to 7 PM and monthly from July to October 2022. DO concentrations and water levels were measured monthly. Water inundation status had the most influential effect on carbon fluxes with flooded conditions supporting higher CH4 fluxes (0.39 mu mol CH4 m- 2 s- 1; -1.23 mu mol CO2 m- 2 s- 1) and drier conditions supporting higher CO2 fluxes (0.03 mu mol CH4 m- 2 s- 1; 0.86 mu mol CO2 m- 2 s- 1). When flooded, the wetland was a net CO2 sink; however, it became a source for both CH4 and CO2 when water levels were low. We compared chamber -based gas fluxes from the cove in flooded (July) and dry (August) months to fluxes measured with an eddy covariance tower whose footprint covers flooded portions of the wetland. The diurnal pattern of carbon fluxes at the tower did not vary with changing water levels but remained a CO2 sink and a CH4 source even when the cove where we performed the chamber measurements dried out. These results emphasize the role of inundation status on wetland carbon cycling and highlight the importance of fluctuating hydrologic patterns, especially hydrologic drawdowns, under changing climatic conditions.					; Bohrer, Gil/A-9731-2008; Missik, Justine/H-9123-2017; Missik, Justine/AAZ-5012-2020	Pope, Talia/0000-0002-7677-7954; Smith, Chelsea/0000-0003-1728-2609; Missik, Justine/0000-0002-6448-0694; McMurray, Steven/0000-0002-1187-5916; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 10	2024	915								170089	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170089		JAN 2024						38224896					WOS:001171980600001

Pinus resinosa Tree-Ring Latewood Response to Daily-Scale Precipitation Variability at Lake Itasca, Minnesota	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Analysis of daily scale climate observations alongside sub-annual tree-ring data offers new potential for contextualizing climate change in the Great Lakes region. This pilot study combined daily observations from a high-quality station record with a co-located chronology of Pinus resinosa latewood width at Lake Itasca, Minnesota. We evaluate trends in observational data and use multiple methods to compare day-wise aggregated climate observations with tree rings over the eleven-decade common period. The Itasca record exhibited strong increases in warm-season precipitation, minimum temperature in all seasons, and lengthening of the freeze-free season. Correlation analyses verified a strong, multi-month warm-season precipitation response in Pinus resinosa latewood width. Distinct from previous work, daily data analyses were used to fingerprint an ~2-week period starting in late July when rainfall variability was historically a major control on interannual tree growth. Climatologically, the timing of this subseasonal critical climate period corresponds with a relative minimum in mean midsummer precipitation. Since the 1980s, the latewood correlation with midsummer rainfall has vanished, and the seasonal-scale rainfall response diminished considerably. This result, new for Pinus resinosa in Minnesota, is consistent with studies showing a declining relationship between tree growth and drought in the Midwest United States. Further attribution analyses emphasizing daily-scale phenomena are needed to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the tree-growth response to variability, change, and extremes in climate throughout the Great Lakes region, where the biophysical and socioeconomic impacts of climate change are multifaceted issues of increasing urgency.					; Griffin, Daniel/AAE-8381-2021	Trumper, Matthew/0000-0002-9881-7742; Griffin, Daniel/0000-0002-1547-3615														2624-9375				JAN 25	2022	3								801265	10.3389/frwa.2021.801265	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2021.801265													WOS:000752605800001

In-reservoir transformation of dissolved organic matter as a function of hydrological flow	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Reservoirs are vital to meet the ever-increasing demands for freshwater in a warming climate. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents an important pool of carbon and can be a major concern in drinking water sources. However, insights into DOM dynamics in temperate, semi -arid reservoirs remain limited. Therefore, we investigated the variations in DOM properties in Lake Diefenbaker, a large reservoir on the Canadian Prairies, by analyzing eight years of DOM concentrations and composition through linear mixed effect modeling. Contrary to expectations, reservoir dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration showed no correlation with inflow from the South Saskatchewan River (p = 0.12), while dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) increased with decreasing inflow (p = 0.002). DOM optical indices (SUVA254 and E4:E6 ratio) and DOC:DON ratio revealed a pronounced influence of inflow on reservoir DOM composition (p < 0.001), i.e., allochthonous characteristics increased with increasing flow, and autochthonous characteristics increased with declining flow. Travel time corrected comparison of approximately the same water parcel along the reservoir length revealed that increasing water residence time in downstream regions led to a significant transformation in DOM composition, favoring autochthonous characteristics (mean SUVA(254) reduced by 0.52 L mg -C-1 m(-1), and the E4:E6 and spectral slope ratio increased by 1.6 and 0.06, respectively). Autochthonous DOC inputs likely offset the allochthonous DOC losses, which resulted in a relatively stable DOC concentration throughout the reservoir (mean 3.7 mg L-1). Additionally, the effect of a large aquaculture operation on reservoir DOM properties was investigated, but no effect was detected. The results have significant implications for managing large river -reservoirs. Autochthonous DOM poses challenges to water processing, necessitating monitoring of DOM composition for reservoir drinking water quality. Insights on climate -induced changes in DOM properties will also assist with understanding changes to habitat conditions and contaminant transport.					hudson, jeff/G-6171-2012; Imtiazy, Md Noim/IAR-7360-2023	Hudson, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0256-3240; Hunter, Kristine/0000-0002-0744-999X; Imtiazy, Md Noim/0000-0003-4012-2216; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				FEB 14	2024	352								120099	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120099		JAN 2024						38232598					WOS:001164045300001

Snowmelt and its role in the hydrologic and nutrient budgets of prairie streams	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Small watersheds in the Canadian Prairies are characterized by seasonally disconnected hydrologic networks whereby stream channels are hydrologically connected during snowmelt but have disconnected reaches throughout the remainder of the year. Snowmelt is the most significant hydrological event in the Canadian Prairies, yet few studies have investigated the role of snowmelt in the nutrient budget of prairie streams. We quantified hydrologic and nutrient dynamics during snowmelt for ten agricultural subwatersheds distributed along a gradient of human activity in the Red River Valley, Canada, to evaluate the timing of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) export. Elevated concentrations of total P (TP) and total N (TN) were observed during the snowmelt peak, with maximum concentrations reaching 3.23 mg TP L(-1) and 18.50 mg TN L(-1). Dissolved P and N dominated the total nutrient pool throughout snowmelt, likely due to reduced erosion and sediment transport resulting from the combination of the flat topography, frozen soil and stream banks, and gradual snow cover melt. Significant correlations were observed between snowmelt N load (r = 0.91; p < 0.05) and both agricultural land cover and fertilizer usage, with a weaker correlation between snowmelt P load (r = 0.81; p < 0.05) and agricultural area. Our results showed that snowmelt plays a key role in nutrient export to prairie aquatic ecosystems and this may have serious impacts on downstream ecosystems. Land use management practices need to consider the snowmelt period to control nutrient loads to Lake Winnipeg and other waterbodies in the Great Plains.

The soluble carbohydrate concentrations of the rhizomes of Mug-mites australis and Typha latifolia were low at the beginning of the vegetation period; they reached their minima in February and March, respectively. Thereafter, soluble carbohydrate concentrations of both plants gradually increased until maximal values in August, thereafter decreasing gradually. Total soluble carbohydrate concentration in Typha latifolia rhizomes was higher than that of Phragmites australis during all months.

J	Yurista, P; Kelly, JR; Miller, SE				Yurista, Peder; Kelly, John R.; Miller, Samuel E.			Lake Superior: Nearshore variability and a landscape driver concept	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Spatial variation is well known to exist in water quality parameters of the Great Lakes nearshore; however, strong patterns for extended reaches also have been observed and found to be robust across seasonal time frames. Less is known about robustness of inter-annual variation within parameters for water quality in the nearshore. We have conducted high-resolution surveys with towed electronic instrumentation in nearshore areas of Lake Superior and have combined several seasons (2001-2005) of measurements from multiple research efforts to investigate how spatial variation compares across years. The combined survey tows ranged across approximately 1200 km of Lake Superior's south shore. In addition to the survey tracks, we also sampled fixed stations to collect calibration data and other parameters not observed by the in situ electronic sensors. The towed sensor data provided information on the spatial and temporal variability of water quality parameters along the nearshore. We found a consistent spatial pattern over time along the south shore of Lake Superior. Nearshore water quality parameters were analyzed with respect to landscape characteristics of the adjacent watersheds (US only) using multivariate stepwise regressions and found to correlate to landscape characterization. The stressor categories of landscape character that best described the nearshore parameters were agriculture-chemical usage and land-cover attributes. Peak nearshore values corresponded with landscape position that had the most altered landuse character (e. g. Duluth/Superior region). The landscape character appears to drive and maintain the spatial pattern in nearshore water quality parameters.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2011	14	4					345	355		10.1080/14634988.2011.624942	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2011.624942													WOS:000298355900004

Regional geological mapping has refined the sedimentary target stratigraphy and constrained the thickness of the sedimentary sequence at the time of impact to similar to 1880 m. New 40Ar-39Ar dates place the impact event at similar to 39 Ma, in the late Eocene. Haughton has an apparent crater diameter of similar to 23 km, with an estimated run (final crater) diameter of similar to 16 km. The structure lacks a central topographic peak or peak ring, which is unusual for craters of this size. Geological mapping and sampling reveals that a series of different impactites are present at Haughton. The volumetrically dominant crater-fill impact melt breccias contain a calcite-anhydrite-silicate glass groundmass, all of which have been shown to represent impact-generated melt phases. These impactites are, therefore, stratigraphically and genetically equivalent to coherent impact melt rocks present in craters developed in crystalline targets. The crater-fill impactites provided a heat source that drove a post-impact hydrothermal system. During this time. Haughton would have represented a transient, warm, wet microbial oasis. A subsequent episode of erosion, during which time substantial amounts of impactites were removed, was followed by the deposition of intra-crater lacustrine sediments of the Haughton Formation during the Miocene. Present-day intra-crater lakes and ponds preserve a detailed paleoenvironmental record dating back to the last glaciation in the High Arctic. Modern modification of the landscape is dominated by seasonal regional glacial and niveal melting, and local periglacial processes. The impact processing of target materials improved the opportunities for colonization and has provided several present-day habitats suitable for microbial life that otherwise do not exist in the surrounding terrain.

J	Cardille, JA; Ventura, SJ; Turner, MG				Cardille, JA; Ventura, SJ; Turner, MG			Environmental and social factors influencing wildfires in the Upper Midwest, United States	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Although the vast majority of contemporary wildfires in the Upper Midwest of the United States have a human origin, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the roles played by abiotic, biotic, and human factors in determining the spatial patterns of their origins across the region. The Upper Midwest, a 2.8 x 10(5) km(2) area in the northern, largely forested parts of the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, contains regions of varied land cover, soil type, human settlement densities, and land management strategies that may influence differences in the observed spatial distribution of wildfires. Using a wide array of satellite- and ground-based data for this region, we investigated the relationship between wildfire activity and environmental and social factors for >18 000 reported fires of ail sizes between 1985 and 1995. We worked at two spatial scales to address the following questions: (1) Which abiotic, biotic, and human variables best explained decade-scale regional fire activity during the study period? (2) Did the set of factors related to large fires differ from the set influencing all fires? (3) Did varying the spatial scale of analysis dramatically change the influence of predictive variables? (4) Did the set of factors influencing the number of fires in an area differ from the set of factors influencing the probability of the occurrence of even a single fire? These data suggest that there is no simple "Lake States fire regime" for the Upper Midwest. Instead, interpretation of modern fire patterns depends on both the fire size considered and the measurement of fire activity. Spatial distributions of wildfires using two size thresholds and viewed at two spatial scales are clearly related to a combination of abiotic, biotic, and human factors: no single factor or factor type dominates. However, the significant factors for each question were readily interpretable and consistent with other analyses of natural and human influences on fire patterns in the region. Factors seen as significant at one scale were frequently also significant at the other, indicating the robustness of the analysis across the two spatial resolutions. The methods for conducting this spatially explicit analysis of modern fire patterns (generalized linear regression at multiple scales using long-term wildfire data and a suite of environmental and social variables) should be widely applicable to other areas. Results of this study can serve as the basis for daily, seasonal, or interannual studies as well as the foundation for simulation models of future wildfire distribution.					; Turner, Monica/B-2099-2010	Turner, Monica/0000-0003-1903-2822; Cardille, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4667-9085; 													1051-0761	1939-5582				FEB	2001	11	1					111	127		10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0111:EASFIW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0111:EASFIW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000166749100010

As the snow thickness increases from 0 to 7.0 cm, the albedo increases from 0.27 to 0.96. The bulk extinction coefficients of snow, snow-ice, and congelation ice are 9.47, 9.69, and 2.18 m-1, respectively. The peak of the transmission spectrum shifts from the blue to green light waveband compared to the solar radiation spectrum. The proportion of incident radiation at surface penetrating to the under-ice water ranges from 0.5% to 19.7% associated with snow depth from 7 cm to 0 cm. Fresh snow influences the under-ice light condition crucially, and therefore the seasonal evolution of the lake phytoplankton community is affected.

Because of climate fluctuation, human activities, and water conservancy projects, it has been reported that natural fish resources of the silver carp have been declining in a wavy trend from 1950. However, few studies have explored the potential effects of determining the relationship between the adult fish and fish larvae. Using the field survey method, this study analyzed the fisheries resource status of the adult silver carp and its early life stage in the Yangtze River. Results indicated that different geographic populations showed significant habitat dependence, and the adult silver carp tends to choose habitats with slow water flow, rich biological bait, and less human interference. What is more, its distribution pattern has regional and seasonal differences obviously. Additionally, redundancy analysis on the fish larvae showed that water temperature and water flow are the two most important factors influencing the fish larvae blooming. According to the generalized additive model (GAM), the hydrological factors that significantly influence the larvae abundance are water temperature, transparency, daily increasing rate of water level, and discharge (p < 0.05). Combining the historical and present research data, the results indicated that river and lake connected habitat is essential for the silver carp recruitment and migration. Future studies should focus on the complementary mechanism of silver carp both in the natural habitat and invasion waters. It is suggested that the spawning habitat should be well protected during the channel project and economic belt construction along the Yangtze River.																				2296-7745				JAN 21	2022	8								790614	10.3389/fmars.2021.790614	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.790614													WOS:000751282900001

In accordance with the RCA, the integrity of communities found in a given location should be analyzed according to their deviation from the communities that would be expected in the absence of anthropogenic disturbances. The RCA was used here with the aim of defining the Maximum Ecological Potential (MEP) of tropical reservoirs located in the hydrographical basin of the Paraopeba River in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Among the reservoirs, Serra Azul is used as a water supply and is located in a core area of environmental protection where tourism is not allowed and the native vegetation is conserved. The benthic macroinvertebrate communities at 90 sites located in three reservoirs were analyzed and sampled every 3 months over 2 years. The temporal patterns of the communities in the three reservoirs were analyzed (2nd-STAGE MDS and ANOSIM) and were not significantly related to seasonal fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. Twenty-eight sites belonging to the Serra Azul reservoir were selected to define the MEP of these reservoirs because these sites had the lowest human disturbance levels. The macroinvertebrate taxa present in the selected MEP sites are similar to those of natural lakes and different from the communities of disturbed sites. The biological classification of these sites revealed two groups with distinct macroinvertebrate communities. This distinction was related to climatic variables, bottom substrate type, the presence of gravel/boulders, coarse sand, silt, clay or muck, depth, and the shoreline substrate zone. These two subsets of biological communities and respective environmental conditions can serve as a basis for the future implementation of ecological quality monitoring programs for tropical reservoirs in the study area. This approach can also, however, be implemented in other geographic areas with artificial or heavily modified water bodies.

J	Oueriaghli, N; Béjar, V; Quesada, E; Martínez-Checa, F				Oueriaghli, Nahid; Bejar, Victoria; Quesada, Emilia; Martinez-Checa, Fernando			Molecular Ecology Techniques Reveal Both Spatial and Temporal Variations in the Diversity of Archaeal Communities within the Athalassohaline Environment of Rambla Salada, Spain	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We have studied the distribution of the archaeal communities in Rambla Salada (Murcia, Spain) over three different seasons and observed the influence upon them of the environmental variables, salinity, pH, oxygen and temperature. Samples were collected from three representative sites in order to gain an insight into the archaeal population of the rambla as a whole. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis patterns and diversity indexes indicate that the diversity of the archaeal community in Rambla Salada changed mainly according to the season. We found no significant differences between the types of sample studied: watery sediments and soils. The upwelling zone showed most diversity in its archaeal community. The overall archaeal community was composed mainly of Halobacteriales and Thermoplasmatales, accounting for 72.6 and 12.1 % of the total, respectively. Haloarcula was the most abundant genus, being present at all three sites during all three seasons. Some few Crenarchaeota were always found, mainly at low-salinity levels. Ordination canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that salinity affected the structure of the community significantly, whilst pH, oxygen and temperature did so to a lesser extent. Most Halobacteriales correlated positively with salinity and pH, whilst Thermoplasmatales correlated negatively with both salinity and pH and positively with temperature and oxygen. The archaeal community with the highest diversity was sampled during June 2006, the season with the highest salt concentration. Catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the percentage of archaea in Rambla Salada compared to the total number of microorganisms (as measured by DAPI) ranged from 11.1 to 16.7 %. Our research group had isolated the most abundant taxon, Haloarcula, previously in Rambla Salada using classical culture techniques, but on this occasion, using culture-independent methods, we were also able to identify some phylotypes, Halorubrum, Methanolobus, Natronomonas, Halomicrobium, Halobacterium, Halosimplex, uncultured Thermoplasmatales and uncultured Crenarchaeota, that had remained undetected during our earlier studies in this habitat.

J	Cho, MS; Park, J				Cho, Myung Sik; Park, Jinwoo			Spatiotemporal lake area changes influenced by climate change over 40 years in the Korean Peninsula	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Water resources in lakes of the Korean Peninsula play a significant role in society and ecosystems in both South and North Korea. This study characterized spatiotemporal changes in the lake area during the dry season (March-May) in the Korean Peninsula over the last 40 years. The satellite images (Landsat 5-9) were used to derive annual areas of 975 lakes during the dry season from 1984 to 2023. Our analysis indicated that the MNDWI is the optimal remote sensing-based index for delineating lake areas in the Korean Peninsula, with an overall accuracy of 92.3%. Based on the selected index, the total lake areas of the dry seasons have increased from 1070.7km(2) in 1984 to 1659.3km(2) in 2023, mainly due to newly constructed dam reservoirs. While the detailed changes in lake area vary, we found divergent results based on their sizes. The large lakes (> 10 km(2)) showed their area increased by 0.0473 km2 (0.1%) every year and have more influences from climate change. On the contrary, the small lakes (<= 10 km(2)) have area decreases by 0.0006-0.006km(2) (0.15-0.5%) every year and have less influence from climate change. This study shows that the spatiotemporal lake area changes are determined by either climate change or human activity.					; Park, Jinwoo/ACQ-1786-2022	Park, Jinwoo/0000-0002-6774-216X; 													2045-2322					JAN 11	2024	14	1							1144	10.1038/s41598-023-51084-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-51084-2								38212426					WOS:001142462100004

Heavy metal accumulation in field cultured and tissue cultured Kappaphycus alvarezii and Gracilaria changii	INTERNATIONAL FOOD RESEARCH JOURNAL												Use of raw seaweed for direct consumption and its extract in food production has increased steadily throughout the world. However the ability of metal sorption in seaweed may result in accumulation of some heavy metals which could be harmful to consumers. Tissue culture has been considered as an alternative method to produce uncontaminated seaweeds as seedlings for sustainable farming and raw materials for various industries including food production. In this study, Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to determine the metal concentration in both field cultured and tissue cultured Kappaphycus alvarezii and Gracilaria changii. Results indicated that concentration of heavy metals with great scientific importance such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) from tissue cultured samples has met the specific standard of health requirement from Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additive (JECFA) and Health Council and National Medicine Academy of France. Tissue cultured seaweeds also appeared to have lower As, Cd and Pb concentrations as compared to field cultured seaweeds. This may due to the stable and clean environment provided in tissue culture, contrasting with uncontrollable seasonal inflow of heavy metals in the field.

Jane; Middleton, Richard			Replicability of data collected for empirical estimation of relative pollen productivity	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The effects of repeated survey and fieldwork timing on data derived from a recently proposed standard field methodology for empirical estimation of relative pollen productivity (RPP) have been tested. Seasonal variations in vegetation and associated pollen assemblages were studied in three contrasting cultural habitat types; semi natural ancient woodlands, lowland heaths, and unimproved, traditionally managed hay meadows. Results show that in woodlands and heathlands the standard method generates vegetation data with a reasonable degree of similarity throughout the field season, though in some instances additional recording of woodland canopy cover should be undertaken, and differences were greater for woodland understorey taxa than for arboreal taxa. Large differences in vegetation cover were observed over the field season in the grassland community, and matching the phenological timing of surveys within and between studies is clearly important if RPP estimates from these sites are to be comparable. Pollen assemblages from closely co-located moss poisters collected on different visits are shown to be variable in all communities, to a greater degree than can be explained by the sampling error associated with pollen counting, and further study of moss polsters as pollen traps is recommended.

The amphibian Pelophylax bergeri (Gunther, 1986) testis poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases: relationship to endocrine disruptors during spermatogenesis	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												In a growing deterioration of the ecosystem both in terms of biodiversity and ecological features, even more problematic is the conservation of species. The aim of this work was to study seasonal variations of biochemical and molecular DNA damage markers in Pelophylax bergeri exposed to potential endocrine disrupting chemicals. Frogs were collected in the main phase of the reproductive cycle: in April and May, during active spermatogenesis and the breeding season, and in October and November, in spermatogenetic regression, from a sampling site in the polluted Sarno River and from a clean reference site (Matese Lake). DNA profile and poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) activity were evaluated in the testis. In the main phases of the reproductive cycle, all specimens from Sarno River showed a PARP activity higher than that measured in the same frog's testis from Matese Lake. In addition, the PARP activity in active spermatogenesis was always higher compared with the activity in the spermatogenetic regression in Sarno River frogs. PARP2, usually activated in response to exposure to heavy metals, was expressed in all testes. In the species examined from Sarno River, no evident correlation between testis DNA damage and PARP activation was found. The working hypothesis is that PARP, implicated in genome surveillance and protection, might represent in frog spermatogenesis an appealing tool for genotoxic risk assessment useful to define a warning alarm for its survival.					; GUERRIERO, Giulia/M-1058-2019	GUERRIERO, Giulia/0000-0002-5018-072X; 													1125-0003	1748-5851				JUN	2014	81	2					256	263		10.1080/11250003.2014.902124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2014.902124													WOS:000338989400011

Their stratigraphic position between the Middle Jurassic Yan-Liao Biota and the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Biota gives them a special importance. New discoveries allow a re-assessment of theropod and possible ornithopod tracks that are present with several trackways. Seventy-three footprints were examined and documented. Despite their smaller size, the tridactyl mesaxonic theropod tracks show morphological similarities with the ichnogenus Therangospodus known from the Upper Jurassic deposits of North America, Europe, and Central Asia. The possible ornithopod tracks lack an associated manus imprint, suggesting a bipedal trackmaker. These possible ornithopod tracks from the Houcheng Formation provide evidence for the presence of small basal ornithopods or basal Cerapoda in the Upper Jurassic Lower Cretaceous in this region.

Heavy metal concentrations in the water, sediments and fish were measured; bioaccumulation factor, metal pollution index as well as condition indices were calculated, to assess the pollution load and health status of the fish. Multivariate statistical analysis was used on wetland water and sediment heavy metals to ascertain the possible sources and seasonal variations of the pollutants. Results showed that most heavy metals in the wetland water and sediments exceeded the water (drinking and irrigation) and sediment quality guidelines, respectively. Seasonal variations were observed for geogenic heavy metals, Mn, Fe, Mg and Ca while no seasonal variations were observed for anthropogenic heavy metals, Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb and Ni. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that there was strong correlation between geogenic and anthropogenic heavy metals in water and sediment, both originating from the common anthropogenic sources. Accumulation of most of the metals in all the tissues was above the safe limits as recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization.

LONG-TERM MONITORING OF WATER DYNAMICS IN THE SAHEL REGION USING THE MULTI-SAR-SYSTEM	XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)	JUL 12-19, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Fresh water is a scarce resource in the West-African Sahel region, seasonally influenced by droughts and floods. Particularly in terms of climate change, the importance of wetlands increases for flora, fauna, human population, agriculture, livestock and fishery. Hence, access to open water is a key factor. Long-term monitoring of water dynamics is of great importance, especially with regard to the spatio-temporal extend of wetlands and drylands. It can predict future trends and facilitate the development of adequate management strategies. Lake Tabalak, a Ramsar wetland of international importance, is one of the most significant ponds in Niger and a refuge for waterbirds. Nevertheless, human population growth increased the pressure on this ecosystem, which is now degrading for all uses. The main objective of the study is a long-term monitoring of the Lake Tabalak's water dynamics to delineate permanent and seasonal water bodies, using weather-and daytime-independent multi-sensor and multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data available for the study area. Data of the following sensors from 1993 until 2016 are used: Sentinel-1A, TerraSAR-X, ALOS PALSAR-1/2, Envisat ASAR, RADARSAT-1/2, and ERS-1/2. All SAR data are processed with the Multi-SAR-System, unifying the different characteristics of all above mentioned sensors in terms of geometric, radiometric and polarimetric resolution to a consistent format. The polarimetric representation in Kennaugh elements allows fusing single-polarized data acquired by older sensors with multi-polarized data acquired by current sensors. The TANH-normalization guarantees a consistent and therefore comparable description in a closed data range in terms of radiometry. The geometric aspect is solved by projecting all images to an earth-fixed coordinate system correcting the brightness by the help of the incidence angle. The elevation model used in the geocoding step is the novel global model produced by the TanDEM-X satellite mission. The advantage of the Multi-SAR-System is that it comprises ortho-rectification, radiometric enhancement, normalization and Kennaugh decomposition, independent from sensors, modes, polarizations or acquisition date of SAR data. In addition, optical satellite data can be included as well, to fill gaps where SAR data are missing due to the special normalization scheme. This kind of pre-processing is exclusively implemented at the Earth Observation Center of the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. Therefore, the dynamic change of the open water of the Lake Tabalak could be classified over dry and rainy seasons and years, using different SAR data. The study provides a unique database and contributes to a better understanding of wetland systems in the Sahel region influenced by human pressure and climate change.

Variable Efficacy of Extended-release Mosquito Larvicides Observed in Catch Basins in the Northeast Chicago Metropolitan Area	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS												Since the mid-1990s, the North Shore Mosquito Abatement District (NSMAD) has applied extended-release formulations of mosquito larvicides to approximately 50,000 catch basins in the suburbs north of Chicago, IL, USA. This is performed as part of NSMAD's efforts to reduce local populations of the West Nile virus vector, Culex pipiens. Analyses from NSMAD's monitoring of larvicide-treated basins throughout the District over the 2014 and 2015 seasons suggest that larvicides intended to provide extended durations of control (30-180 days) failed to provide control for the maximum duration specified on the product label in approximately 25% of the District's basins. For larvicides designed to last up to 180 days (or about 26 weeks), failures were found at 1-15 weeks after treatment with most found at five weeks posttreatment. For larvicides formulated to last up to 30 days, failures were found at one to four weeks after applications with most found at three weeks posttreatment. The highest percentages of failing basins (ie, containing late-stage mosquito larvae or pupae during the specified product effectiveness period) were found in communities on the eastern side of the District, bordering Lake Michigan. As the larvicides appeared to function properly in the majority of monitored basins, it appears that the failures likely resulted from basin-specific physical factors (ie, basin volume, sediment content, and hydrology) that cause either product removal or a reduction in the concentration of the larvicide's active ingredient below the effective levels in these basins.																			1178-6302						2016	10						65	68		10.4137/EHI.S38096	http://dx.doi.org/10.4137/EHI.S38096								27103818					WOS:000387839600001

Seasonal Rainfall-Runoff Variability Analysis, Lake Tana Sub-Basin, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia	LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS, SOILS AND HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES IN VARIED CLIMATES	Springer Geography											Lake Tana sub-basin of Abbay (Blue Nile) River Basin is located in the high land areas with unimodal rainy season with spatial and temporal variation of rainfall and runoff. Depending on available resources, there are many developmental plans and projects which seek the wise planning and management of water resources considering both low flows and floods. The seasonal streamflow variability analysis of the basin was performed with recorded meteorological and hydrological data. The four seasons of the year are considered for seasonality analysis. The rainfall variability is analysed using seasonality and variability measures of coefficient of variation, seasonal relative rainy days and seasonal rainfall intensity. The rainfall variability is more related with latitude and longitude. Spatial and temporal seasonal rainfall variation is analysed from daily rainfall data. Seasonal runoff and streamflow variations are also analysed using HEC-HMS hydrological model to generate runoffs at required and selected points to detect spatial variation. Runoff variation for catchments with gauged stations was analysed from recorded time series streamflow data. Runoff coefficient is taken as a variability index for both generated and recorded streamflows. The runoff coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. The range is high in the dry seasons and less in the wet seasons. The average runoff coefficient value of the basin is 0.28 ranging from 0.18 to 0.36. The average seasonal runoff coefficient value from generated runoffs is 0.45, 0.3 for dry and 0.6 for wet seasons. From the results, it is shown that runoff coefficient is more dependent on antecedent soil wetness condition, land use and land covers. Catchments were categorised spatially and temporally as vulnerable, moderately vulnerable and less vulnerable to runoff based on the analysis. From hydrological data variability tests, it is clearly observed that seasonal time series data are not homogeneous, stationary and independent. Minimum flows are more stationary and homogeneous than mean and maximum flows.

We compared long-term patterns of concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic (DON) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in aquatic ecosystems of the Arbutus Lake watershed to evaluate how a lake nested in a forested watershed affects the sources (e.g., production) and sinks (e.g., retention) of DOC and DON in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA. We observed no significant long-term changes of DOC and DON in the lake outlet since 1983 and 1994, respectively. However, the temporal patterns of DOC and DON concentrations in the lake inlet showed significant seasonality such as increases during the vegetation growing season along with notable decreases in the dormant season. A comparison of mass balances between inlet and outlet for the period from 2000 to 2009 suggested that the lake was a sink of DOC (mean of influx minus out flux: +1140 mol C ha(-1) yr(-1)). In contrast, the difference of discharge-weighted DON concentrations (mean of inlet minus outlet: 1.0 mu mol N L-1) between inlet and outlet was much smaller than the discharge-weighted DOC concentrations (average of inlet minus outlet: + 87 mu mol C L-1). DON fluxes showed considerable variation among years (mean of influx minus outflux: +8 mol N ha(-1) yr(-1); range of differences: -15 to 27 mol N ha(-1) yr(-1)). DON exhibited low percent retention ((influx-outflux)/influx) (mean: 6.9 %, range: 34.8 to +31.2) compared to DOC (mean: 30.1 %, range: +9.2 to +44.1). The resultant increase of DON within the lake was closely linked with a net decrease of DIN through monthly Pearson correlation analysis, suggesting the importance of biotic factors in mediating lake DON dynamics Our results show different relative retentions of DOC compared with DON, along with a larger retention of DIN than DON, suggesting that DOC and DON might display substantially different biogeochemical relationships in oligo-mesotrophic lakes nested forested watersheds and therefore different roles for a sink behavior for DOC compared to a producer of DON.

S	Madsen, DB		Oviatt, CG; Shroder, JF		Madsen, D. B.			The Early Human Occupation of the Bonneville Basin	LAKE BONNEVILLE: A SCIENTIFIC UPDATE	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											No direct evidence exists that people once occupied the shores of Lake Bonneville, but well-dated sites along coastal South America and overlooking a pluvial lake in the northwestern Great Basin suggest early foragers had reached the Bonneville Basin (BB) at least by similar to 14-15 cal ka. Dated hearths in cave sites overlooking the wetlands that developed during the regressive phase of Lake Bonneville indicate Paleoarchaic foragers, characterized by a variety of stemmed points and crescents, were definitely living in the BB by similar to 13.5-13.0 cal ka. Their subsistence and settlement apparently focused on extensive wetland ecosystems, where the highest number of Paleoarchaic sites is found. The largest of these wetlands, similar to 2600 km(2), formed at the terminal end of the Old River Bed (ORB) river that once flowed from Lake Gunnison in the Sevier basin north to the Great Salt Lake. More than 500 Paleoarchaic sites have been recorded in the ORB delta wetlands, and as many as 4-5000 may have been created during the similar to 2500 years or longer these wetlands were occupied. Geochemical sourcing of tool-stone and intensive use of manufactured tools suggest these foragers stayed in the ORB wetlands for extended periods, perhaps moving about within the wetlands during the prolonged stays. When they did leave the wetlands they primarily moved about in a narrow similar to 400 km long north-south corridor within the BB. After the regression of Great Salt Lake from the Gilbert level by similar to 11 cal ka, the ORB wetlands were supported by groundwater flow supplied by stored Lake Bonneville water. Between similar to 9.5 and 9.0 cal ka this groundwater ceased to flow, the ORB wetlands dried up, BB foragers began to adapt to those changes, and the Paleoarchaic period effectively ended. These changes included a more intensive use of upland habitats, a seasonal reliance on pine nuts, and the development of grinding to process a variety of seeds. However, these Archaic foragers and later groups continued to seasonally occupy the many caves and rockshelters created by Lake Bonneville and the lake's impact on the people of the BB has never entirely disappeared.																			0928-2025		978-0-444-63594-5; 978-0-444-63590-7				2016	20						504	525		10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00018-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00018-4													WOS:000409050100020
J	Milani, D; Grapentine, LC				Milani, D.; Grapentine, L. C.			Prioritization of sites for sediment remedial action at Randle Reef, Hamilton Harbour	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour, an enclosed embayment at the western end of Lake Ontario, was designated as an Area of Concern in 1985 under the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative. The harbour has been disturbed by wastes from steel industries, municipal wastewater discharges, and urban runoff. The area of the harbour known as Randle Reef has the largest volume of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminated sediment on the Great Lakes and will be undergoing a major remediation project. An engineered containment facility will be constructed on top of the most contaminated sediment and surrounding sediments will be dredged and placed inside the engineered containment facility, or capped. To determine where remediation was required, areas were prioritized according to toxicity and contaminant concentrations. Although benthic invertebrate community assessment can be the best indicator of in situ toxicity, this was problematic in the harbour due to lack of appropriate reference areas for comparison and potential effects of other stressors (e.g. disturbances of sediments from ship traffic, seasonal low hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations). Initial prioritization of areas for remediation was therefore based on toxicity to benthic invertebrates and the associated contaminant levels. In 2002, 80 sites were sampled and laboratory bioassays conducted with the Amphipod Hyalella azteca and the Mayfly Hexagenia spp. Initial site prioritizations were established based on: (1) high contamination and toxicity; (2) high contamination and no/low toxicity; (3) low contamination and toxicity; and (4) low contamination and no toxicity. Final prioritizations considered study design and area considerations as well as additional sediment data obtained to address data gaps. Of the 80 sites, 79% were classed in a priority subgroup, while remaining sites were deemed non-priority.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2016	19	2			SI		150	160		10.1080/14634988.2015.1106224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2015.1106224													WOS:000378052300008

At all lake sites examined, the ice comprised two distinct layers: a snow ice (SI) layer on top and a congelation ice (CI) layer below. The SI layer occupied as much as 29-73% of the total ice thickness, a much greater fraction than that reported for lakes at Arctic high latitudes. In the model, the CI growth rate was estimated using the traditional heat budget method, while the SI growth rate was calculated assuming the excessive snowfall from the isostatic balance is converted to SI by a snow compression rate (beta) with the surface melting rate added when the surface heat budget becomes positive. By tuning the value of beta to the observational results of SI thickness, the model outcome successfully reproduced the observational thicknesses of CI and SI, and the break-up date of the lake. Essentially, the model findings show how snow and its formation into SI reduce, by about half, the seasonal variability of total ice thickness.

Carbon stable isotope composition of charophyte organic matter in a small and shallow Spanish water body as a baseline for future trophic studies	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Quantitative descriptions of foodweb structure based on isotope niche space require knowledge of producers' isotopic signatures. In freshwater ecosystems charophytes are one of the main components of submerged vegetation and the feeding base for many herbivorous consumers, but knowledge about their organic carbon isotopic signatures is sparse. In this study, the delta C-13 organic values (and organic % C and % N) of the four species of submerged macrophytes (three charophytes - Chara hispida, Nitella hyalina and Tolypella glomerata - and one angiosperm, Myriophyllum spicatum) growing in a newly created shallow pond were measured monthly over a period of one year, to discern if i) all charophyte species susceptible to being food for consumers and growing in the same waterbody have the same C isotopic composition; ii) the delta C-13 values of a charophyte species change on a seasonal and spatial scale; iii) the different parts (apical nodes, internodes, rhizoids, reproductive organs, oospores) of a charophyte species have the same isotopic composition. The delta C-13, % C and % N values of organic matter in the sediments where the plants were rooted were also measured as well as several limnological variables. The delta C-13 values for the angiosperm (-13.7 +/- 0.7%) indicated C-13-enrichment, whereas the N. hyalina delta C-13 values were the most negative (-22.4 +/- 0.7%). The mean delta C-13 value for C. hispida was -19.0 +/- 1.0% and -20.7 +/- 0.8% for T. glomerata. C. hispida delta C-13 values had a significant seasonal variation with C-13-poor values in the cold season, and slight spatial differences. Statistically significant differences were found between charophyte rhizoids (C-13-enriched) and the other parts of the thalli. The delta C-13 values in the sediments varied throughout time (-13% to -26%). The C content was lower in the charophytes than in the angiosperm and there were no large differences among the charophytes. Charophyte fructifications were enriched in organic C compared to the thallus parts. The study provides an isotopic baseline for further studies for the elucidation of higher trophic-level relationships which are particularly complex in shallow water bodies where interactions between the pelagic and the benthic zones are intricate.

J	Sen, A; Bhadury, P				Sen, Areen; Bhadury, Punyasloke			Exploring the seasonal dynamics within the benthic foraminiferal biocoenosis in a tropical monsoon-influenced coastal lagoon	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												Benthic foraminiferal assemblages are widely used as bioproxies for coastal environment monitoring. The present study investigated seasonal variations in live benthic foraminiferal assemblages over a period of 12 mo from the largest coastal lagoon in Asia, which is strongly influenced by tropical monsoons. The investigation revealed an extremely low diversity of benthic foraminiferal assemblages, comprising 12 species, of which 8 were agglutinated. The most dominant taxa throughout the study period belonged to the genus Ammonia. The living assemblage was restricted to the topmost 4 cm of the sediment, with the majority of assemblages occurring in the top 2 cm. Data analysis revealed the presence of a significant variation in the biotic assemblage, indicating a patchy distribution. Overall, some of the benthic foraminiferal species, such as Ammomarginulina sp. and Miliammina obliqua, showed strong seasonal variation, while the dominant Ammonia spp. did not show any temporal variation. The environmental parameters displayed significant correlations with certain species, although no single factor could be identified as being the major force driving assemblage composition. The present findings of seasonality and correlations observed between certain factors with certain species may be utilized to improve biomonitoring in similar settings on a global scale.

The aim of this study was to downscale the global circulation model (GCM) to Weyb watershed for analyzing the impact of climate change on hydrological variability. The SDSM was used to downscale the GCM output and it has accurately replicated the observed series both for A2a and B2a scenarios. SWAT model was calibrated and validated to simulate streamflow. For each future time horizon, the change in mean annual maximum and minimum temperature has indicated a slight increment from the base period both for A2a and B2a scenarios. The projected precipitation revealed the average seasonal precipitation could increase in dry season and decrease in wet season both for A2a and B2a scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s time period. The change in annual streamflow with exception to 2080s shows an increase by 0.83 % and 0.64 % in 2020s and 2050s, respectively, under A2a scenario, and by 5.02 % in 2080s under B2a scenario. Subsurface flow parameters were found to be more sensitive to the streamflow of the watershed. The annual streamflow might be reduced by 1.5 % in 2080s under A2a scenario and could also be reduced by 1.14 % and 0.99 % in 2020s and 2050s, respectively, under B2a scenario. The result has revealed an increase of streamflow on dry season and reduction on the wet and intermediate seasons which has similar pattern with the rainfall. The change in the amount and distribution of rainfall and level of temperature would affect agricultural productivity and water utilizations in the region.

The aim of this review is to provide information to who monitor fish populations in tropical reservoirs. The topics, investigative methods, observation scaling, and metrics used in publications since 1960's were inventoried. Temporal and spatial variations in fish population and fish production were the primary topics. Since 2000, studies on trophic structures and fish biological parameters have appeared. Experimental fishing with gillnets has been the technique most often used, but others include hydroacoustics for fish stock assessments and modeling to characterize trophic structures. Annual and seasonal scaling approaches dominated, as well as longitudinal/transversal gradient sampling, which permitted the characterization of fish colonization processes and the detection of halieutic resource overexploitation. For modeling approaches, the entire reservoir was considered. The calculated metrics varied depending on the investigation method. Species richness, number of individuals, and biomass per unit effort were the most common metrics for the different topics. Trophic level, effectiveness, and consumption rate were specific to trophic structure. To monitor reservoir fish populations, it is necessary to have an eco-systemic approach.					tessier, anne/K-4913-2019; GUILLARD, Jean/A-2577-2011	Guillard, Jean/0000-0003-0116-1167; 													2330-8249	2330-8257					2016	24	2					160	177		10.1080/23308249.2015.1112766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23308249.2015.1112766													WOS:000368195500005

Nests were mostly located in shallow waters, close to the shore (98.3 +/- 37.9 cm), in vegetation dominated by Scirpus lacustris. The egg-laying period started at the end of March and extended for four months until the end of July. Overall, the mean clutch size was 4.7 +/- 1.1 (N = 154) with a modal clutch of 5. There was a seasonal decline in both egg volume and clutch size. The overall nesting success was 60% and the chief causes of nest failure were predation (52%) and adverse weather (20%). Breeding outcome was influenced by water depth, nest size and year of breeding. predation and nest flooding markedly varied between years. Larger nests had a higher nesting success than smaller ones. Likewise, nests located at greater water depth (further from the shore) succeeded better than ones located in shallower water. As the little grebe forages preferentially in shallow waters, these results suggest that optimal nesting locations may be the result of a trade-off between conflicting selection pressures such as foraging efficiency (better in shallow waters) and nest predation risk (greater in shallow waters).					; Samraoui, Farrah/E-6757-2011; Samraoui, Boudjéma/E-6761-2011	Samraoui, Farrah/0000-0003-2407-3004; ATHAMNIA, Mohammed/0000-0002-0383-8058; Samraoui, Boudjema/0000-0002-0608-9021; 													0570-7358					JUN	2015	62	1					113	124		10.13157/arla.62.1.2015.113	http://dx.doi.org/10.13157/arla.62.1.2015.113													WOS:000357052300008

We evaluated the effects of a seasonal growth pattern and structure of macrophyte species on epiphytic microcrustaceans collected from macrophyte surfaces (stems and leaves) in shallow wetlands from May 2011 to October 2012. In 2011, epiphytic microcrustaceans that preferred free-floating macrophytes (Spirodela polyrhiza and Salvinia natans) and submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton crispus and Ceratophyllum demersum) were affected by the seasonal growth of these species. Epiphytic microcrustaceans were abundant on the surface of Spirodela polyrhiza in June and August and on Salvinia natans in September and October. In 2012, epiphytic microcrustaceans preferred submerged macrophyte species over the free-floating ones. The results of stable isotope analysis showed that epiphytic microcrustaceans depend on epiphytic particulate organic matter (EPOM) from each macrophyte species rather than on suspended particulate organic matter. Small species (Coronatella rectangula, Pleuroxus laevis, and Chydorus sphaericus) used EPOM (dominated by epiphytic algae) on free-floating and submerged macrophyte species; however, relatively larger species (Ilyocryptus spinifer and Macrothrix rosea) used EPOM only from submerged macrophytes. Based on these findings, we conclude that the distribution of epiphytic microcrustaceans is determined by seasonal characteristics, morphology of macrophyte species, and abundance of food resources.					정, 광석/ITT-0455-2023; CHOI, Jong-Yun/AAT-6338-2020	CHOI, Jong-Yun/0000-0003-3237-8334													1730-413X	1897-3191				JUN	2015	44	2					151	163		10.1515/ohs-2015-0015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2015-0015													WOS:000355751400002

Results showed that GPP ranged from 16 to 1789 mg O-2 m(-2)d(-1) and R-e from 56 to 1083 mg O-2 m(-2)d(-1), respectively. GPP and R-e exhibited significant temporal variation and both reached the highest level in June, however, GPP and R-e reduced in July and August, which could be explained by the increase of turbidity caused by high freshwater inflow discharge in rainy season. Maximum photosynthetic rate of blue-greens was the most sensitive parameter to GPP. Re was strongly related to temperature, the most sensitive parameter was average epilimnetic temperature. A significant negative correlation was found between GPP, R-e and freshwater inflow. Furthermore, significant direct and indirect effects of tidal height on GPP were observed by path analysis, increased turbidity induced by tidal action might explain the influence on GPP.

J	Hulden, L; Hulden, L				Hulden, Lena; Hulden, Larry			The decline of malaria in Finland - the impact of the vector and social variables	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background: Malaria was prevalent in Finland in the 18th century. It declined slowly without deliberate counter-measures and the last indigenous case was reported in 1954. In the present analysis of indigenous malaria in Finland, an effort was made to construct a data set on annual malaria cases of maximum temporal length to be able to evaluate the significance of different factors assumed to affect malaria trends. Methods: To analyse the long-term trend malaria statistics were collected from 1750-2008. During that time, malaria frequency decreased from about 20,000 - 50,000 per 1,000,000 people to less than 1 per 1,000,000 people. To assess the cause of the decline, a correlation analysis was performed between malaria frequency per million people and temperature data, animal husbandry, consolidation of land by redistribution and household size. Results: Anopheles messeae and Anopheles beklemishevi exist only as larvae in June and most of July. The females seek an overwintering place in August. Those that overwinter together with humans may act as vectors. They have to stay in their overwintering place from September to May because of the cold climate. The temperatures between June and July determine the number of malaria cases during the following transmission season. This did not, however, have an impact on the long-term trend of malaria. The change in animal husbandry and reclamation of wetlands may also be excluded as a possible cause for the decline of malaria. The long-term social changes, such as land consolidation and decreasing household size, showed a strong correlation with the decline of Plasmodium. Conclusion: The indigenous malaria in Finland faded out evenly in the whole country during 200 years with limited or no counter-measures or medication. It appears that malaria in Finland was basically a social disease and that malaria trends were strongly linked to changes in human behaviour. Decreasing household size caused fewer interactions between families and accordingly decreasing recolonization possibilities for Plasmodium. The permanent drop of the household size was the precondition for a permanent eradication of malaria.																			1475-2875					MAY 7	2009	8								94	10.1186/1475-2875-8-94	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-8-94								19422702					WOS:000266328300001
J	Martin, AR; da Silva, VME				Martin, AR; da Silva, VME			River dolphins and flooded forest: seasonal habitat use and sexual segregation of botos (Inia geoffrensis) in an extreme cetacean environment	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Habitat use by the boto, or Amazon river dolphin Inia geoffrensis, was investigated in and around the Mamiraua Reserve, Brazil. Largely forested with numerous channels and lakes, Mamiraua comprises a variety of seasonal floodplain habitats known collectively as varzea. The annual cycle of flooding in this region (amplitude 11-15 m) dominates all life. Profound seasonal differences in dolphin density between habitats were consistent with known fish movements, in turn dictated by changes in water level and dissolved oxygen. An exodus of botos from floodplain to river at low water prevents dolphins being trapped in areas that become entirely dry. Densities of botos in floodplain channels were seasonally higher (up to 18 km(-2)) than reported for any cetacean worldwide. Adults were largely segregated by sex except at low water. Females and calves dominated in chavascal habitat the areas most remote from rivers, which were preferred by mates. Probable causes of this segregation are the energetic requirements of calves and the safety of females and/or calves from male harassment. Some 80% of botos occurring on rivers were within 150 m of the margins. The reliance of adult females and calves on varzea in a region with exceptional dolphin densities demonstrates the importance of floodplain habitats for the boto, and may be the key determinant of this species' distribution.					da Silva, Vera/AAE-8126-2021														0952-8369	1469-7998				JUL	2004	263		3				295	305		10.1017/S095283690400528X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S095283690400528X													WOS:000222908100009
J	Carlson, SM; Quinn, TP				Carlson, Stephanie M.; Quinn, Thomas P.			Ten years of varying lake level and selection on size-at-maturity in Sockeye Salmon	ECOLOGY												Despite the ubiquity of studies quantifying the strength and form of selection in nature, rarely is the ecological context for contemporary selection understood. Here we report a case where lake level is a selective factor acting on sockeye salmon body size-at-maturity because low lake levels cause large salmon to strand and die rather than reach the breeding grounds. As a result of a semelparous life history, death for salmon at this stage results in a lifetime fitness of zero. We combined information on the level of Lake Aleknagik ( southwestern Alaska, USA) from 1952 through 2006 with a detailed comparison of the body size of mature salmon that died at the mouth of Hansen Creek vs. individuals that successfully ascended to the spawning grounds over 10 breeding seasons ( 1997 - 2006). The percentage of salmon stranding at the mouth varied among years: 2 - 42% in males and <1 - 26% in females. Formal selection analyses indicated that the largest individuals were most susceptible to stranding mortality, especially in years when many salmon stranded, and these were years with low lake levels. Taken together, these results suggest that lake level was a strong and consistent selective force acting on this salmon population, acting synergistically with size-selective predation by bears. Salmon breeding in Hansen Creek tend to be smaller, younger, and more streamlined than conspecifics from neighboring populations, suggesting that selection against large individuals could be driving these patterns.

Today, the Makgadikgadi Basin is an arid to semi-arid area receiving water of meteoric origin during the short, wet season. Large microbial mats, which support primary production, are formed due to desiccation during the dry season. This study aimed to characterise the microbial diversity of the microbial mats and the underlying sediment. The focus was the Ntwetwe Pan, located west of the Makgadikgadi Basin. Metagenomic analyses demonstrated that the mats consisted of a high relative abundance of Cyanobacteriota (synonym Cyanobacteria) (20.50-41.47%), Pseudomonadota (synonym Proteobacteria) (15.71 to 32.18%), and Actinomycetota (synonym Actinobacteria) (8.53-32.56%). In the underlying sediments, Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota, and Euryarchaeota represented over 70% of the community. Localised fluctuations in water content and pH did not significantly affect the microbial diversity of the sediment or the mats.					; Macey, Michael/ABK-9206-2022; Price, Alex/JOZ-7177-2023; Schwenzer, Susanne/H-6992-2019	Olsson-francis, Karen/0000-0002-4684-3981; CAVALAZZI, BARBARA/0000-0002-5135-9529; Schwenzer, Susanne Petra/0000-0002-9608-0759; Lebogang, Lesedi/0000-0002-4186-7183; Macey, Michael/0000-0002-1800-0469; Filippidou, Sevasti/0000-0002-1458-7143														2076-2607				JAN	2024	12	1							147	10.3390/microorganisms12010147	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms12010147								38257974					WOS:001151267400001

In order to analyze the cause of COD increase, the compositional characteristics of organic matter were investigated using three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy technology. The results showed that the most polluted area was located in the geographic center of the outer Caohai Lake, where COD reached 29 mg/L and was elevated by 52%, and protein-like and humus-like features were evident in the organic matter fractions. By measuring the characteristics of water in Caohai Lake, it was found that the fluorescence indexes were greater than 2.47, the biological index was distributed between 0.67 and 1.06, and the humification index was distributed between 1.81 and 3.12. It indicated that the lake had low humification and showed strong autochthonous source characteristics. The bloom outbreak was one of the main reasons for the elevated COD concentration. This study will provide theoretical support for the control of organic pollution in Dianchi Lake.

Concentrations of GHGs dissolved in water typically increase with decreasing lake size due to coastal abrasion and organic matter delivery. We hypothesized that (i) CH4 oxidation depends on the natural oxygenation gradient in the lake water and sediments and increases with lake size because of stronger wind-induced water mixing; (ii) CO2 production increases with decreasing lake size, following the dissolved organic matter gradient; and (iii) both processes are more intensive in the upper than deeper sediments due to the in situ gradients of oxygen (O-2) and bioavailable carbon. We estimated aerobic CH4 oxidation potentials and CO2 production based on the injection of C-13-labeled CH4 in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm sediment depths of small (similar to 300 m(2)), medium (similar to 3000 m(2)), and large (similar to 10(6) m(2)) shallow thermokarst lakes in the West Siberian Lowland. The CO2 production was 1.4-3.5 times stronger in the upper sediments than in the 10-20 cm depth and increased from large (158 +/- 18 nmol CO2 g(-1) sediment d.w. h(-1)) to medium and small (192 +/- 17 nmol CO2 g(-1) h(-1)) lakes. Methane oxidation in the upper sediments was similar in all lakes, while at depth, large lakes had 14- and 74-fold faster oxidation rates (5.1 +/- 0.5 nmol CH4-derived CO2 g(-1) h(-1)) than small and medium lakes, respectively. This was attributed to the higher O-2 concentration in large lakes due to the more intense wind-induced water turbulence and mixing than in smaller lakes. From a global perspective, the CH4 oxidation potential confirms the key role of thermokarst lakes as an important hotspot for GHG emissions, which increase with the decreasing lake size.					; Dorodnikov, Maxim/AAE-7764-2020; Lim, Artyom/O-4069-2017; Manasypov, Rinat/S-2135-2016; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010; Pokrovsky, Oleg/C-8078-2016; Krickov, Ivan/AAG-8605-2019; fan, lichao/J-6206-2019	Lim, Artem/0000-0003-0165-4754; fan, lichao/0000-0003-1349-3134; Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069; Manasypov, Rinat/0000-0001-5191-2817; Dorodnikov, Maxim/0000-0002-7834-890X; Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				JAN	2024	30	1							e17120	10.1111/gcb.17120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17120								38273495					WOS:001134087400001

This harms human life and endangers aquatic and natural resources, agricultural practices, and food security. Water governance is crucial to ensure the well-being of both people and their food security. However, Cambodia's water governance is hindered by various obstacles, including sectoral and centralized influences, top-down and large-scale strategies, weak coordination among relevant agencies, and limited involvement of local communities. This study examines water governance across different sectors, from centralized to community-based natural resources management, and explores the opportunities that can be done to improve water governance. This study undertakes the literature and case studies of farmer water user communities (FWUCs), community fisheries (CFis), and community fish refuges (CFRs) in three Mekong Delta provinces in Cambodia. This study concludes that water governance has been challenged by FWUCs competing for water resources to intensify rice production at the expense of increased pesticides and fertilizer uses, which undermine the fishery productivity, degrade the natural resources in rivers and water bodies, and increase water conflicts among farmers and sectors in the face of climate change. To enhance water governance in Cambodia, it is critical to integrate it at the district level. This will promote sustainable water use and management across the country and pave the way for a brighter future.					; Sithirith, Mak/I-7144-2019	Mak, Sithirith/0000-0002-9567-6585; sok, sao/0009-0008-7173-0349														2073-4441				JAN	2024	16	2							242	10.3390/w16020242	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16020242													WOS:001150946100001

Assessing fish diversity in abandoned mining ponds in Madre de Dios, Peru, using environmental DNA	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA												The Peruvian region of Madre de Dios is a biodiversity hotspot located in the Andean-Amazon region. Since the 1970s, it has experienced the harsh effects of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), which has transformed the primary forests into numerous small mining ponds left abandoned after extraction. Preliminary surveys indicate that these ponds are being recolonized by surrounding biodiversity. These assessments are typically carried out using traditional methods that are costly, difficult to deploy at multiple locations, and have raised safety concerns. In this context, environmental DNA (eDNA) becomes a useful tool for biodiversity monitoring due to its simplicity for sample collection and performance to identify taxonomic groups. In this study, we evaluated fish biodiversity in two mining ponds created by ASGM along with two nearby pristine lakes, unimpacted by mining operations but also influenced by seasonal flooding. We compared two alternative eDNA processing methods and contrasted our results with historic data from traditional biodiversity monitoring. Both eDNA-based methods yielded comparable results, varying only in logistic requirements and costs. In total, we detected 85 fish MOTUs (22 at the species level) from 5 orders, 22 families, and 41 genera. Some of the species identified with eDNA were rarely registered by traditional monitoring, and we could identify 6 genera associated with ASGM mining ponds only. A major restriction of the eDNA approach in this location was the insufficient local taxa registered in genomic databases which limited our taxonomic resolution. Despite this limitation, our results indicate that eDNA could be a powerful tool for biodiversity estimations in the Western Amazon, identifying more taxa, with much less time and money invested than traditional monitoring. Our results also confirm that abandoned mining ponds are being recolonized by surrounding ichthyofauna, reaching richness levels above nearby unmined oxbow lakes used as reference.

Optical satellite remote sensing has been widely used to detect water SDD at regional, continental, or global scales, with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) providing an excellent platform for fast and large-scale monitoring of SDD for global lakes. Hence, this study evaluates whether retrieving SDD for global lakes is possible by applying machine learning algorithms using Landsat top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance embedded in GEE. Eleven algorithms were calibrated (5498 samples), and their performances were validated (2749 samples) with a global dataset of Landsat TOA reflectance and in situ SDD matchups. The results indicated that the smallest modeling error was derived from gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) ( $R<^>{2} =0.98$ , root-mean-square error (RMSE) =0.27 m, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) =10.52%, and mean absolute error (MAE) =0.07 m), followed by XGBoost (XGB) and particle swarm optimization-random forest (PSO-RF). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that combining GBDT, XGB, PSO-RF, and Landsat TOA reflectance provides a robust way to monitor SDD across global lakes. Eventually, global SDD maps for 2020 were produced using Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) TOA imagery, with SDD changing range from 0.01 to 13.1 m (mean =3.3 m). The machine learning models in this study can be applied to archived Landsat imagery to assess SDD trends of global lakes and capture annual or seasonal variations.

In order to accurately analyze the time series settlement variation of the surface, this paper used Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology to obtain 23 Sentinel-1A orbit SAR images covering Dexing Copper Mine for temporal settlement monitoring. The monitoring results show that there are three obvious settlement funnels within the mining area, and the total settlement area is about 7.63 km2, located in the southwest of the Copper Factory, the southwest of Fujiawu Stope and between Duyang Lake and the Copper Factory, the maximum cumulative settlement in the area is -1131.9 mm, and the maximum annual average settlement rate is -375.5 mm/a. In order to analyze the change trend of settlement in mining area timely and accurately, make full use of monitoring data to carry out disaster prevention and warning in mining area, and solve the problem that the prediction accuracy of traditional settlement prediction model is not high, this paper proposes a time series settlement prediction model that takes into account the periodic and seasonal variation of settlement-EMD-ARIMA (Empirical Mode Decomposition-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model), further, perform retrospective predictive analysis of the monitoring data. The results show that compared with the traditional GM (1,1) and ARIMA models, the average RMSE of EMD-ARIMA model is increased by 78.5% and 49.5%, and the average MAE is increased by 74.4% and 52.4%, respectively. The average MAPE increased by 81.2% and 47.9%, respectively. It shows that the EMD-ARIMA model has high prediction accuracy, strong stability and adaptability, and can be used to predict the time series data of mining settlement, which can provide scientific guidance for the safety production of mining areas.

Lake water and hydrothermal fluids seep through the western flank of the volcano where they precipitate gypsum and form the hyperacid Banyu Pahit river. In this contribution, we present compositional data from bi-weekly samples taken from the Banyu Pahit between 2015 and 2018 to evaluate whether these fluids can be used to monitor the hydrothermal system, and compare the fluids to the record of variability documented by the precipitated gypsum. Understanding the causal links between variability of the Banyu Pa hitand the magmatic-hydrothermal processes operating in the Kawah lien system, and establishing a baseline for quiescence are pre-requisites to using the river for monitoring. Fluid samples were analysed at the lien observatory for SO4/Cl ratio using BaSO4 turbidity and AgCl gravimetry, and subsequently sent for ICP-MS and ICP-OES analyses. The data shows a first order seasonal variation that can be explained by variable input of neutral groundwater, but is underlain by more subtle trends. Temporally, there is a shift in the system from 2015-2016 to 2017 when the fluid contains a higher proportion of elements derived from rock alteration. The shift occurs at the peak of the rainy season and coincides with a substantial rainfall increase in 2017 compared to 2015-2016. At the start of 2018 there is a marked increase in Cu, coinciding with a gas burst in March 2018. We suggest that an increased meteoric water input led to an increase in water-rock interaction and dissolution of a Cu-sulphide phase in the hydrothermal system. The variability of the fluids over the 3-year sampling period does not exceed that of the longer record preserved by the gypsum precipitates, indicating that it is typical for the current style of activity.

However, the influence of recent increase in precipitation on spatiotemporal variation of surface water area is poorly understood in the Red River Basin (RRB, northern United States and southern Canada). Here, we used a high-resolution global surface water dataset to understand spatiotemporal dynamics of the annual, total, permanent, and seasonal water extent in RRB. Monthly surface water area is investigated to detect the change in seasonal surface water extent. We found four distinct phases of variation in surface water: Phase 1 (1990-2001, wetting); Phase 2 (2002- 2005, dry); Phase 3 (2006-2013, recent wetting); and Phase 4 (2014-2019, recent drying). A bare land to a permanent and seasonal water area switch is observed during Phase 1, while the other phases have experienced relatively little fluctuation. Findings have implications for nutrient concentration assessment in lakes and wetlands.

J	Danish, M; Tripathy, GR				Danish, Mohd; Tripathy, Gyana Ranjan			Sources and internal cycling of dissolved barium in a tropical coastal lagoon (Chilika lagoon, India) system	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The abundance and distribution of barium (Ba) serve as a reliable proxy for oceanic biogeochemical processes. Its cycling in the coastal regions, however, is complicatedly regulated by multiple sources/sinks. In this study, the spatial distribution of dissolved barium concentrations in a large coastal lagoon (Chilika lagoon, India) and its source waters have been investigated for three different seasons (pre-monsoon (May 2017), monsoon (August 2017), and post-monsoon (January 2018)). Additionally, contents of Ba and other elements in the bed and suspended sediments in their different fractions (bulk, clay, and exchangeable) have also been investigated. These data were used to constrain coastal processes in regulating coastal Ba inventory. The dissolved [Ba] of the Bay of Bengal (median - 37 nmol/kg (range: 30-53 nmol/kg)) are lower than that observed for the river (median - 319 nmol/kg (range: 256-583 nmol/kg)), and groundwater (median - 464 nmol/kg (range: 20-4428 nmol/kg)) samples. The salinity-weighted barium concentrations of the Chilika lagoon for the premonsoon (1052 nmol/kg) and monsoon (652 nmol/kg) seasons are higher compared to that during the postmonsoon period (332 nmol/kg). Covariations between salinity and [Ba] confirm the non-conservative behavior of barium during all three seasons. The salinity-[Ba] trends show barium removal in the low-salinity regions, attributable to its authigenic scavenging onto Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides. Mass balance calculations show that the relative contribution of barium via rivers (-18%), (freshwater) submarine groundwater discharge (SGD; -25%), and desorption from particulate matters (-19%) to the lagoon during pre-monsoon seasons is nearly the same. During the monsoon season, the SGD supply of barium decreases to -2%, whereas riverine (-20%) and desorption (-24%) contributions remain similar to that observed during the pre-monsoon. The sediment chemistry (Mg, Al, Fe) data and their correlations with Ba concentrations reveal that the desorptive release of barium to the lagoon is mainly via its cationic replacement from the suspended sediments by seawater Mg. In addition to these sources, our results show that about half of the dissolved barium during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons remains unaccounted and may have been supplied by an additional source, which may be linked to subsurface supply of recirculated seawater and/or organic matter remineralization. Our quantitative approach emphasizes the importance of these additional sources in regulating the coastal barium inventory.																			0304-4203	1872-7581				MAR 20	2022	240								104083	10.1016/j.marchem.2021.104083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marchem.2021.104083		JAN 2022											WOS:000750835600001

Based on the similarity of the dissolved elemental concentrations, the water samples were mainly divided into the three groups: samples with relatively high percentages of Ca, Mo, and Sb (Subcluster B1); samples with high Si, Al, and Fe (B2); and samples with high Na, K, and Mg (B3). During the rainy season, the elemental composition of lake water (B1) appeared to be greatly influenced by the intrusion of water from the Mekong River (B1) through the Tonle Sap River (B1). During the dry season, the type of lake water shifted to B3, suggesting that the lake water stored during the rainy season was replaced by inflow from other tributaries and groundwater in its vicinity. Thus, the seasonal changes in the elemental composition of the lake water were largely controlled by surface water and groundwater circulation. The dissolved As concentration was higher in the lake water and during the dry season than that in the river water and during the rainy season, indicating the discharge of As from the lake's bottom sediment during the dry season. Although the redox cycling of Fe and Mn appeared to be less important due to the shallow water depth in the lake, there are potential risks of As poisoning induced by the formation of an anoxic water mass and increment in the concentration of phosphorus if eutrophication continues to progress.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN 29	2020	192	7							467	10.1007/s10661-020-08292-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08292-4								32601932					WOS:000763506900007

Seasonal trophic variation of yellow perch exceeds spatial variation in a large lake basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Trophic structuring of complex food webs may vary at multiple spatial and temporal scales, both in terms of direct trophic connections and underlying energy pathways that support production. In large freshwater systems, the prey and primary producers that support individual higher-order consumers may vary across seasons and habitats due to differences in food availability, predator consumption patterns, seasonal succession of organisms at lower trophic levels, and heterogeneous nutrient inputs. We examined spatial and temporal variation in stomach contents, fatty acids, and stable isotopes of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) across seasons and across sites spanning approximately 200 km in Lake Erie's Central Basin (LECB). Stomach contents provided a short-term index of trophic patterns, while biochemical markers (fatty acids and stable isotopes) provided a more temporally integrated description of underlying energy pathways and trophic links. We found limited spatial variation of biochemical indicators and documented seasonal variation for all three trophic indicators, especially fatty acid profiles. Differences in stomach contents were driven by relative chironomid consumption, the most abundant prey resource, while fatty acid profiles were predominantly influenced by seasonal fluctuations in C22:6n-3 (DHA). Seasonal trends were evident in delta C-13 and delta N-15; however, they varied within a narrow range of values. Our findings suggest that adult yellow perch in LECB showed little differentiation in resource use across space in 2014, but their diets and biochemical compositions varied seasonally.

Paleoenvironments and human occupation in the El Bolson Valley of northwest Argentina (province of Catamarca, dept. of Belen)	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												Using an interdisciplinary perspective that integrates archaeological, geomorphological, and palynological data, this work analyzes the relationship between environmental changes and cultural landscapes in the El Bolson Valley in the province of Catamarca, Argentina. The palynological and sedimentological studies took place using a sediment core extracted from a seasonal lake, while the geomorphological studies made use of stratified fluvial deposits. The palynological sequence indicates that wetter conditions existed at 6400 cal BP, but that this wetness decreased to create the current more arid conditions along with increases in anthropogenic disturbance. There is also evidence for intense processes of sediment accumulation and erosion, including changes in the uses of space by human populations as recorded for the last 2000 years in fine deposits from the valley floor. The present work also makes an effort to insert this local history into its broader context, in order to contribute to existing knowledge regarding late Holocene changes at the regional level.

The region's susceptibility to seasonal environmental shifts and climate oscillations is heightened by the annual movements of the tropical rain belt driven by atmospheric circulation. Yet, there is no satisfying age depth model available for the entire sedimentary sequence strongly limiting our understanding of changes in this circulation pattern and associated (broad-scale) environmental responses during the last million years in the local to regional context of Lake Bosumtwi. To overcome this, we statistically examine the cyclicity in total natural gamma ray (NGR) data on a core from the lake's centre and create a cyclostratigraphic age-depth model. The calculated maximum age of 946 ka agrees well with the meteorite impact age (similar to 10 % offset). In order to refine this purely statistical approach, we also perform a correlative age-depth model using 33 tie points accounting for the complexity of climatic and environmental imprints to the NGR record that may exceed direct insolation related effects. Special attention is paid to the core's robustly dated (C-14, OSL, U/Th) uppermost part covering the last 200 ka. Here, high NGR and co-varying K counts coincide with warm periods (except of the water-saturated and unconsolidated Holocene part) and the inverse for glacials and stadials. Based on this, we define tie points for correlating our NGR data to the age-depth model of a NE Atlantic SST record. Comparing our results to the correlation target, other global climate records and Sahara dust flux data reveals striking similarities and supports a proxy understanding with increased in wash of K-enriched terrigenous material from the crater rims in warm and moist periods (high NGR) and K-depleted dust input in stadials possibly contributing to low NGR values in addition to reduced input of K-enriched sediments from the crater rims. Our correlative age model results in precession amplitudes matching eccentricity well, providing further support especially because an over-tuning is unlikely with the used 33 tie points. Overall we provide crucial chronological context to numerous datasets along with environmental constrains that can be used to study the potential habitat availability of early anatomically modern humans in West Africa.					; Kaboth-Bahr, Stefanie/ABF-7573-2021; Gosling, William/D-2459-2009; Pierdominici, Simona/JAC-4185-2023; Voigt, Silke/G-7270-2017; Zeeden, Christian/AFO-4070-2022	Zeeden, Christian/0000-0002-8617-0443; Gosling, William/0000-0001-9903-8401; Pierdominici, Simona/0000-0002-5368-4536; Noren, Anders/0000-0002-5604-1085; Voigt, Silke/0000-0002-2560-5933; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				FEB 1	2024	325								108478	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108478		DEC 2023											WOS:001166169700001

Thunderstorms predominantly occur in the southeast region and move to the northeast at a speed of 16-64 km/hr. Most thunderstorms have short durations (98.3%, <= 3 hr) and low CG flash frequencies (90.0%, <= 64). Thunderstorms with longer durations are mainly triggered near the mountains and tend to occur (end) earlier (later) in the afternoon (evening). The peak composite reflectivity (CR) corresponding to CG flashes from all thunderstorms is 50 dBZ. Approximately 70% (20%) of CG flashes occur in convective (stratiform) areas. The first CG flash of a thunderstorm tends to occur in convective areas with a higher CR than that of the last CG flash. The average and maximum CRs of CG flashes increase significantly with thunderstorm duration. Thunderstorms are known as a type of weather system that is typically accompanied by the presence of lighting and other hazardous weather (high winds, heavy rain, hail and tornadoes). Cloud-to-ground (CG) lighting produced by thunderstorms is a highly dangerous weather phenomenon that occurs between a thundercloud and the ground and often causes wildfires, explosions and severe damage to buildings. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin in China are a transition zone between plateaus and plains, with dense urban agglomerations, rivers and lakes. However, thunderstorm activity in such complex underlying surfaces is poorly understood. Based on ground-based radar and lightning observations, the statistical characteristics of thunderstorm activity in this region during the warm seasons (May to September) of 2016-2020 are analyzed using a lightning clustering method. The CG lighting number, area and displacement of thunderstorms increase with thunderstorm duration. Thunderstorms that last longer are mostly triggered near the mountains and often start earlier in the afternoon and end later in the evening. In addition, CG lighting produced by thunderstorms is associated with high radar echo intensity. These findings are useful for improving the nowcasting of lightning and other hazardous weather caused by thunderstorms. The cloud-to-ground (CG) flash number, area, displacement, etc., of thunderstorms based on lightning data change with increasing thunderstorm durationThunderstorms with longer durations, mostly triggered near the mountains, occur earlier in the afternoon and end later in the eveningRadar echo characteristics of CG flashes from thunderstorms with different durations show certain regularities					Sun, Jianhua/JDM-6978-2023	Ma, Zheng/0000-0002-6255-3343													0094-8276	1944-8007				DEC 28	2023	50	24							e2023GL106498	10.1029/2023GL106498	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL106498													WOS:001127092700001

Spatiotemporal Variation of Bacterial Community Composition and Possible Controlling Factors in Tropical Shallow Lagoons	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacterial community composition (BCC) has been extensively related to specific environmental conditions. Tropical coastal lagoons present great temporal and spatial variation in their limnological conditions, which, in turn, should influence the BCC. Here, we sought for the limnological factors that influence, in space and time, the BCC in tropical coastal lagoons (Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil). The Visgueiro lagoon was sampled monthly for 1 year and eight lagoons were sampled once for temporal and spatial analysis, respectively. BCC was evaluated by bacteria-specific PCR-DGGE methods. Great variations were observed in limnological conditions and BCC on both temporal and spatial scales. Changes in the BCC of Visgueiro lagoon throughout the year were best related to salinity and concentrations of NO (3) (-) , dissolved phosphorus and chlorophyll-a, while changes in BCC between lagoons were best related to salinity and dissolved phosphorus concentration. Salinity has a direct impact on the integrity of the bacterial cell, and it was previously observed that phosphorus is the main limiting nutrient to bacterial growth in these lagoons. Therefore, we conclude that great variations in limnological conditions of coastal lagoons throughout time and space resulted in different BCCs and salinity and nutrient concentration, particularly dissolved phosphorus, are the main limnological factors influencing BCC in these tropical coastal lagoons.

Changes in the TP. BSi and total nitrogen (TN) accumulations in the 2003 core correspond to three stages in the trophic history of the lake that include the onset (similar to 1910 to similar to 1950), peak (similar to 1950 to similar to 1970), and amelioration (similar to 1970 to 2003) of eutrophication owing to accelerated nutrient loading. Decreasing BSi:TP atomic ratios (BSi:TPat) from similar to 1910 to similar to 1970 suggest a gradual Si drawdown in the lake during its progressive eutrophication, which led to Si limitation and reduced diatom settling rates. delta N-15 values show pronounced variability in similar to 1950 to similar to 1970, which corresponds with rapid increases in N from runoffs from the lake catchment. A trend of gradually increasing delta N-15 values from similar to 1910 to similar to 1970 is likely the result of denitrification associated with the development of anoxic bottom waters in the Central Basin of the lake. This study illustrates the complexity of extracting environmental information from delta N-15 values in sediments and confirms the need for further studies of the multiple processes and their interactions that contribute to lacustrine delta N-15 records.

An objective differentiation procedure, a principal component analysis, has been used to answer the question: Is it possible to classify different water types using only DOC-patterns, and how do seasonal variations influence such a classification? Organic compounds from various sources and river systems were analyzed by means of automated size-exclusion chromatography. Four different DOC fractions (humic substances, polysaccharides, low molecular weight acids and low weight substances) were separated on the basis of their molecular weight characteristics and quantified on the basis of their UV absorbance. Significant differences in the quality and quantity of organic compounds were found. These were related to the character of the catchment area and to autochthonous processes. It was possible to classify peat-influenced ditch waters, peat-influenced surface waters, mineral soil-influenced and anthropogenically-influenced surface waters, and waters from small and large lake-river systems. The characterization of DOC patterns combined with principal component analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing allochthonous and autochthonous DOC sources in surface waters, especially if seasonal variations are taken into account.

Evaluation of salt effects on some thermodynamic properties of Urmia Lake water	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In this study some thermodynamic parameters including freezing point, boiling point and the vapor pressure of Urmia Lake salt water were investigated as some important environmentally monitored physicochemical properties of Urmia Lake. In this regard salt concentration is chiefly responsible for the modification of the thermodynamic properties of Urmia Lake water which affects its overall environmental and ecological characteristics. On the other hand, the Urmia Lake is now supposed to be the most convenient place for many rare aquatic species and therefore interpreted to be unique from the viewpoint of qualitative characteristics. For the goals of this study water sampling and analysis where performed in two wet and dry periods of the lake in order to represent the extremes of the lake's environmental variability. Prevailing chemical ions in the water body were determined and used for the estimation of the relative thermodynamic coefficients of salt water for the acquisition of the freezing point, boiling point and the vapor pressure of the Urmia Lake water. Interpolated calibration curves were plotted for the changes in the studied parameters versus a variety of salt concentrations indicating a linear relationship between the investigated parameters and the prevailing salt concentration of the Urmia Lake. The calibration curves were then formulated to simplify the estimation of the thermodynamic parameters of the Urmia Lake for any salinity conditions. Real sample analysis also showed a very good agreement between the estimated and observed values.					; Pejman, Amirhossein/IQW-7785-2023; Kokya, Taher/S-8134-2018	Ahmadzadeh Kokya, Taher/0000-0002-2207-0769; 													1735-6865	2008-2304				SPR	2011	5	2					343	348																WOS:000288692100009

Late Quaternary sedimentology and geochronology of small playas on the Southern High Plains, Texas and New Mexico, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Playas are small, circular basins forming a ubiquitous component of the southern High Plains landscape. They are filled with carbonaceous mud deposited since the terminal Pleistocene. The stratigraphy and geochronology of 30 playas was investigated to better understand the paleoenvironmental record of basin filling. At the base of the fill in some playas is a well sorted eolian sand dated between similar to 13,000 and similar to 11,000 C-14 yr BP. The beginning of mud deposition, representing aggradation of eolian dust on a moist, vegetated playa floor was largely between similar to 12,000 and similar to 10,500 C-14 yr BP. Playa filling slowed similar to 9000 to similar to 4000 C-14 yr BP, probably due to dry conditions, increased similar to 4000 to similar to 2000 C-14 yr BP, then slowed again. Eolian sand and learn, likely representing regional aridity, accumulated in some basins episodically just prior to similar to 10,700 C-14 yr BP, between similar to 8600 and similar to 4700 C-14 yr BP, and at similar to 1300 C-14 yr BP. Stable C isotopes from one basin indicate that the playa was inundated only seasonally throughout the record beginning similar to 11,500 C-14 yr BP. The phytolith record in that basin indicates an abrupt shift toward cooling similar to 11,400 to similar to 11,200 C-14 yr BP and then increasing importance of xeric-adapted C-4 grasses through the Holocene.

Hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on trace element export from northern Wisconsin wetlands	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Wetlands play an important role in determining the water quality of streams and are generally considered to act as a sink for many reactive species. However, retention of chemical constituents varies seasonally and is affected by hydrologic and biogeochemical processes including water source, mineral weathering, DOC and SPM cycling, redox status, precipitation/dissolution/adsorption, and seasonal events. Relatively little is known about the influence of these factors on trace element cycling in wetland-influenced streams. To explore the role of wetlands with respect to the retention/release of trace elements to streams, we examined temporal and spatial patterns of concentrations of a large suite of trace elements (via ICP-MS) and geochemical drivers in five streams and wetland rivulets draining natural wetlands in a northern Wisconsin watershed as well as in their groundwater sources (terrestrial recharge, lake recharge, and older lake recharge). We performed principal components analyses of the concentrations of elements and their geochemical drivers in both the streams and rivulets to assist in the identification of factors regulating trace element concentrations. Variation in trace and major element concentrations among the streams was strongly related to the proportion of terrestrial recharge contributing to the stream. A dominant influence of water source on rivulet chemistry was supported by association of groundwater-sourced elements (Ba, Ca, Cs, Mg, Na, Si, Sr) with the primary statistical factor. DOC appeared in the first principal component factor for the streams and in the second factor for the rivulets. Strong correlations of Al, Cd, Ce, Cu, La, Pb, Ti, and Zn with DOC supported the important influence of DOC on trace metal cycling. A number of elements in the rivulets (Al, La, Pb, Ti) and streams (Al, Ce, Cr, Cu, La, Pb, Ti, Zn) had a significant particulate cycle. Redox cycling and precipitation/dissolution reactions involving Fe and Mn likely impacted Cu and Mo as evidenced by the low levels in the rivulets. Variance in Fe, Mn and the metal oxy-anions was associated with factors related to redox cycling and adsorption reactions in the wetland sediments. In streams, DOC and metals with a high affinity for DOC were associated with a factor which also included negative loadings for groundwater-sourced elements, reflecting the importance of seasonal hydrologic events which flush DOC and metals from wetland sediments and dilute groundwater sourced metals. Redox processes were of secondary importance in the streams but of primary significance in the rivulets, documenting the importance of anoxic conditions in wetland sediments on groundwater en route to the stream.																			0168-2563					JUL	2008	89	3					273	294		10.1007/s10533-008-9219-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-008-9219-2													WOS:000258527300001
J	Shimizu, K; Imberger, J				Shimizu, Kenji; Imberger, Joerg			Energetics and damping of basin-scale internal waves in a strongly stratified lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Energetics and damping of basin-scale internal waves and subsequent near-bottom transport processes in Lake Kinneret were investigated using the modal analysis in a layer-stratified irregular basin. The theory was extended to include small linear damping, and energy budgets and damping rates of five dominant internal waves were extracted by fitting numerically calculated internal waves to isotherm displacements measured by six thermistor chains distributed throughout the lake. Energy contained in the dominant internal waves (similar to 3 GJ) resulted from a balance between energy input from diurnal winds and dissipation within a day, both of which were estimated to be 3 similar to 4 GJ d(-1). Damping was caused primarily by bottom friction, and the damping rates (e-folding time) varied from 1 to 3 d, depending on the velocity structure. Currents induced by the internal waves caused considerable spatial variability of the bottom shear stress and near-bottom transport processes, such as entrainment rate at the top of the benthic boundary layer and mass transfer at the sediment-water interface.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2008	53	4					1574	1588																WOS:000257773700034

Typha x glauca dominance and extended hydroperiod constrain restoration of wetland diversity	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Urban wetlands typically have few plant species. In wetlands designed to improve water Received 6 July quality, nutrient-rich water and highly variable water levels often favor aggressive, flood-tolerant plants, such as Typha x glauca (hybrid cattail). At Des Plaines River Wetlands Demonstration Site (Lake Co., IL), we assessed T. x qlauca dominance and plant community composition under varying hydroperiods in a complex of eight constructed wetlands. Plots flooded for more than 5 weeks during the growing season tended to be dominated by T. x glauca, while plots flooded fewer days did not. Plots with high cover of T. x glauca had low species richness (negative correlation, R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). However, overall species richness of the wetland complex was high (94 species), indicating that wetlands in urbanizing landscapes can support many plant species where T. x glauca is not dominant. T. x glauca-dominated areas resisted the establishment of a native plant community. Removing T. x glauca and introducing native species increased diversity initially, but did not prevent re-invasion. Although 12 of the 24 species we seeded became established in our cleared plots, T. x glauca rapidly re-invaded. In year 1, T. x glauca regained an average of 11 ramets m(-2), and its density doubled in year 2. The likelihood of planted species surviving decreased as duration of inundation increased, and in both seeded and planted plots, graminoids had greater survivorship through year 2 than forbs across a range of water levels. Within 4 years, however, T. x glauca was the most common plant, present in 92% of the cleared plots. Simply removing T. x glauca and adding propagules to an urban wetland is not sufficient to increase diversity (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Boronina, AS				Boronina, A. S.			Large-scale outbursts of lakes in the Antarctic oases: current knowledge	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												In recent decades, the importance of studying the outburst lakes of Antarctic oases has been increasing, which is associated with a number of applied and fundamental problems. First of all, because supraglacial, englacial, and glacier-dammed lakes are characterized by a quick response to the climate changes. In the applied aspect, active (unstable) lakes and seasonal streams are relevant for research since they often provoke catastrophic natural disasters. Monitoring and prevention of such events are primarily necessary in the areas of Antarctic stations, where many year-round and seasonal research programs are implemented. This article presents historical and the present-day data and descriptions of lake outbursts located in the oases of East Antarctica. The study is based on the generalization of both published and unpublished materials presented in the funds of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (St. Petersburg), in scientific and technical reports of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition and Russian Antarctic Expedition, Information bulletins (newsletters) of the Soviet Antarctic expeditions, and foreign articles. In addition to that, the results of fieldwork carried out in 2017-2020 were used. Currently, the aforementioned materials are in different form and funds, so the proposed study is the first step of generalizing research on the potential outburst water bodies on the Antarctic Continent. Through to the ongoing work, albeit irregular, our understanding of functioning of the surface hydrological systems of Antarctic oases is steadily growing.

ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The jaguar (Panthera onca) plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity and ecological processes. We evaluated the status of a jaguar population in one of the last stronghold habitats for its conservation in the Atlantic Forest, the Rio Doce State Park (RDSP). We used a random survey design from 2016/17 to estimate jaguar abundance and density as well as its occupancy and detection probabilities in the entire Park's area. To monitor for temporal fluctuations in density and abundance, we used a systematic survey design in the southern portion of the Park where jaguars were more recorded when using the random approach. We then conducted two surveys in 2017/18 and 2020. Our 2016/17 random survey revealed that jaguar density (0.11 +/- SE 0.28 individuals/100 km(2)) was the lowest obtained for the species across the Atlantic Forest. We noticed that jaguar density increased three times from 2017/18 (0.55 +/- SE 0.45 individuals/100 km(2)) to 2020 (1.61 +/- SE 0.6 individuals/100 km(2)). Jaguar occupancy and detection probability were 0.40 and 0.08, respectively. The low jaguar occupancy probability was positively associated with smaller distances from lakes and records of potential prey. The detection probability was positively associated with prey detection, the rainy season, and smaller distances from lakes. Our work contributes to a growing awareness of the potential conservation value of a protected area in a human-dominated landscape as one of the last strongholds for jaguars across the Atlantic Forest.

Informality within Indigenous land management: A land-use study at Curve Lake First Nation, Canada	LAND USE POLICY												Curve Lake First Nation (CLFN) in Ontario has a mainland Reserve area of 649 ha and a Reserve population of 1368; 768 of whom are CLFN members and 600 of whom are seasonal or permanent non-members. Land management is an amalgam - there is much formal land tenure through Certificates of Possession (CPs) and leases but little formal land use planning. A desire by CLFN (Chief and Council, Lands Committee, Lands Manager) for more formal land use planning drove this research. In 2019, 160 CLFN members participated in a land-use study. The results were aggregated into four categories: those that hold land (CP holders), those that do not hold land (non-CP holders), members living on-Reserve, and members living off-Reserve. CP holders and non-CP holders agreed that all parcels should be managed/used according to community values. There was similar agreement between on-Reserve members and off-Reserve members. However, there was little understanding of existing land tenure and land management regimes, and much uncertainty about the distinction between formal and informal land-use. Further analysis revealed, on the one hand, that there was a significant difference in knowledge about how Reserve land may be used between CP holders and non-CP holders, and between on-Reserve and off-Reserve members. We refer to this difference as a disconnect and found a correlation between informality and disconnect. On the other hand, there was no disconnect about the need for formal land-use policies and bylaws, which finding supports the CLFN community as it debates a land-use plan.

The present study investigated diatoms in different habitats of a Don Mocvar mire and their relationship with environmental parameters, as well as the use of diatom indicator values and the German Red List for conservation purposes. The study was conducted monthly from January to November 2012. Diatoms were sampled simultaneously with water for physical and chemical properties in three different habitats. A total of 50 diatom taxa were identified. Based on their relative abundance and diversity, habitat-related environmental factors shaped the diatom community when seasonal dynamics were less important. Multivariate analysis showed that chemical oxygen demand (COD) and conductivity were the most significant environmental variables describing diatom communities. The indicator values characterized the diatoms as a typical mire community and proved to be a reliable starting point for future monitoring and management. Diatom classification by German Red List revealed a dominance of species with priority for conservation, suggesting that the Don Mocvar should have conservation status. This study brings a better understanding of the response of diatoms to living in specific habitats and the basis for future studies on ecological characteristics of new or rare taxa.

Deriving the maximum extent and hydroperiod of open water from Sentinel-2 imagery for global sustainability and biodiversity reporting for wetlands	WATER SA												The monitoring of wetland extent is a global imperative, considering loss of ecosystem services and conservation value. To date, the understanding of the variation in the extent of lacustrine (inundated) wetlands has been limited, based on intermittently available, coarse-scale imagery. The aim of this study was to assess the capabilities of the freely available Sentinel-2 sensor in monitoring inundated wetlands. In particular, to demonstrate the ability to determine the maximum extent of inundation for reporting on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 15.1 (i.e., halting biodiversity loss), the functional diversity and the hydrological regime of depressions were explored in the Mpumalanga Lake District (MLD) of South Africa. Using the monthly inundation data derived from Sentinel-2 images between January 2016 and May 2018, the results showed that the maximum extent of open water can be successfully reported for SDG 6.6. Lacustrine wetlands constituted about 47 of the 416 (but 66% of the total areal extent of) depressions in the MLD, while others were predominantly palustrine (vegetated). The functional diversity varied from predominantly (61% of the extent of) inundated depressions to seasonally (3%) inundated depressions. The Sentinel-2 sensor was able to detect intra- and inter-annual variation of the extent of inundation, making it suitable to monitor these wetlands for global and climate change impacts.					van Deventer, Heidi/Q-8572-2018; Rohlf, F/A-8710-2008; Naidoo, Laven/HJY-7527-2023														0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2022	48	1					75	89		10.17159/wsa/2022.v48.i1.3883	http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/wsa/2022.v48.i1.3883													WOS:000792862700008

Seston and eutrophication on a tropical karst lake district: Lagunas de Montebello, Chiapas, Mexico	LIMNETICA												Large quantities of seston are among the most important indicators of eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. The present study aimed to elucidate the role seston plays in the general limnological dynamics of a cluster of eighteen tropical karstic lakes with different anthropic impacts (non-impacted, oligotrophic, clear-water lakes, and impacted, eutrophic, turbid-water lakes) of the "Lagunas de Montebello" National Park lake district. The seston concentration was measured twice, in the warm/rainy and the cold/dry season. Vertical profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, pH, and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) were recorded at each lake. Water samples were taken along the water column to evaluate seston and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. Impacted lakes displayed higher seston (4.1-21.0 mg/L) and Chl-a (8.1-129.8 mu g/L) concentrations, reduced euphotic zone (Z(EU) = 2.6-6.3 m), and superficial thermo- (gradient = 0.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C/m) and oxyclines (gradient = 4.7 +/- 2.4 mg DO/m). Non-impacted lakes had lower seston (1.0-2.1 mg/L) and Chl-a (0.4-5.2 mu g/L) concentrations, wide Z(EU) (10.1-33.4 m), and deeper thermo- (gradient = 0.5 +/- 0.1 degrees C/m) and oxyclines (gradient = 0.6 +/- 0.4 mg DO/m). The changes reported in impacted lakes linked with the increase in the seston and Chl-a concentrations are most likely related to the eutrophication process associated with anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urban development, land-use change) in the NW part of the area. This research highlights the fragility of the tropical karst lake ecosystems worth protecting to preserve the aquatic ecosystem's health.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021	Oseguera Perez, Luis Alberto/0000-0001-8405-9656; Vargas-Sanchez, Mariana/0000-0002-4681-2755; Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; 													0213-8409	1989-1806					2022	41	2					267	279		10.23818/limn.41.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.41.16													WOS:000811525100006
J	Frka, S; Kozarac, Z; Cosovic, B				Frka, Sanja; Kozarac, Zlatica; Cosovic, Bozena			Characterization and seasonal variations of surface active substances in the natural sea surface micro-layers of the coastal Middle Adriatic stations	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Surface micro-layer (ML) samples were collected in different seasons over a long time period in the coastal area of the Middle Adriatic Sea including the seawater Rogoznica lake location and the semi-enclosed estuarine Martinska station. Natural surface micro-layers were studied as original samples and as ex-situ reconstructed films after previous extraction by organic solvents of different polarities (n-hexane and dichloromethane). Using alternating current (AC) voltammetry (out-of-phase mode) the concentration of surface active substances (SAS) in original ML of both locations was determined, and the enrichment factor (EF) in the ML was related to the underlayer water (ULW) samples collected at 0.5 m depth. Seasonal variability of SAS concentrations of the ML was observed at both locations. The ex-situ films were studied using a modified AC voltammetry method (out-of-phase mode) transferring an organic extract of natural micro-layers spread onto electrolyte from the air-water interface to the mercury electrode surface. The comparison of adsorption characteristics for model lipids of different polarities and those of transferred ex-situ reconstructed films has revealed that different types of lipid material were present in each ex-situ film of the same micro-layer. Additional characterization of the surface active material of natural MLs; was carried out by AC voltammetry (in-phase mode) using cathodic reduction of cadmium ions as an indicator of permeability of different films adsorbed at the mercury electrode. The SAS of ML of both investigated locations induced an inhibition effect to the reduction of cadmium ions. Seasonal variations of inhibition have also been noticed. The electrochemical study contributed to the physicochemical characterization of the surface active matter of the surface micro-layer with the emphasis to the role of lipids which, although they represent a minor fraction of the total micro-layer organic material, contribute considerably to the micro-layer formation and stabilization at the air-water interface.

Evaluating iron as a biomarker of rhythmites - An example from the last Paleozoic ice age of Gondwana	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Microorganisms play a significant role in mineral precipitation, but detecting them in the fossil record is still a challenge. Here we offer an example of how the detection of biological activity in the sedimentary environment can modify a classical depositional model. This study describes the activity of microorganisms in sedimentary structures and the iron mineral formation during the last Paleozoic Ice Age in southwestern Gondwana, recorded by the "Itu rhythmites", Parana Basin, Brazil. The Itu rhythmites have been considered to be varve-type deposits that present alternating dark laminae (clay/silt-size sediments) and light layers (sand/gravel-size sediments) of varied thickness, forming couplets. Earlier studies focused on abiotic processes of these structures. We applied different techniques and analytical approaches were used, such as synchrotron-based techniques and rock magnetic techniques, in order to test the biogenicity of iron minerals contained in putative microbially-induced sedimentary structures. By detecting biominerals in this rock succession, the depositional model had to be reconsidered, taking into account the biological activity, the limitations on the specific conditions for bacterial growth, and for mineral precipitation. Therefore, we offer a new depositional model that considers the role of microorganisms in formation of these laminae, and this model can be considered for other iron-rich rhythmic deposits in other places of the world. Considering the effects of temperature and other factors in the bacterial productivity, the deposition of the latest couplets in the outcrop occurred in different seasons and by different depositional processes, corroborating with the non-periodicity of 1 year per lithological couplet.

J	Poland, MP; de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen, E				Poland, Michael P.; de Zeeuw-van Dalfsen, Elske			Assessing Seasonal Changes in Microgravity at Yellowstone Caldera	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Microgravity time series at active volcanoes can provide an indication of mass change related to subsurface magmatic processes, but uncertainty is often introduced by hydrologic variations and other noise sources that cannot easily be isolated. We empirically assessed seasonality and noise by conducting four surveys over the course of May-October 2017 at Yellowstone caldera, Wyoming. Yellowstone experiences frequent changes in the rates and styles of seismicity and surface deformation, but the mechanisms of these changes are poorly understood. Past gravity data from the caldera have yielded ambiguous results, possibly due to hydrologic noise. Given the strong visually observable changes in surface water and snow conditions over the course of our surveys, we expected to see significant variations in gravity. The net change in gravity, however, was less than 20Gal at most sites, and there was no strong correlation with river and lake levels or snow conditions. Seasonal changes in gravity are therefore small compared to those that would be expected from magmatic activity, although they may be on the same order as those associated with Yellowstone's hydrothermal system. We did find that noise levels in gravity data were highly dependent on site characteristics, with bedrock sites away from trees yielding the lowest levels of noise, and thin concrete pads in forested areas the highest.

Due to their larger population size and shorter generation time, their significance as algal consumers and secondary producers may exceed that of Daphnia during algal blooms and when averaged over the season. The high reproduction rate, the ease of culturing, the accessibility to experimental manipulation, and the potential to apply sophisticated measuring techniques such as flow cytometry render some ciliate species ideal candidates for ecophysiological laboratory experiments. This paper summarizes recent research in which ciliates have been used as model organisms for investigating the effect of environmental key parameters on planktonic organisms. Special attention is given to the (combined) effect of temperature, food, pH and predators. Niche partitioning has been studied at the level of genus, species and clone. Open questions and emerging perspectives of ciliate research for issues of general ecological relevance will be discussed at the end of each section.

A neural network regression model is trained to learn the mapping between the surface physiographic dataset, plus the main meteorologic fields from ERA5, and the MODIS satellite skin temperature observations. Once trained, this tool is applied to rapidly assess the quality of upgrades to the physiographic fields used by land surface schemes. Upgrades which improve the prediction accuracy of the machine learning tool indicate a reduction in the errors in the surface fields used as input to the surface parameterization schemes. Conversely, incorrect specifications of the surface fields decrease the accuracy with which VESPER can make predictions. We apply VESPER to assess the accuracy of recent upgrades to the permanent lake and glacier covers, as well as of planned upgrades to represent seasonally varying water bodies (i.e. ephemeral lakes). We show that, for grid cells where the lake fields have been updated, the prediction accuracy of VESPER in the land surface temperature (as quantified by the mean absolute error) improves by 0.37 K on average, whilst for the subset of points where the lakes have been completely removed and replaced with bare ground, the improvement is 0.83 K. We also show that updates to the glacier cover improve the prediction accuracy by 0.22 K. We highlight how neural networks such as VESPER can assist the research and development of surface parameterizations and their input physiography to better represent Earth's surface coupled processes in weather and climate models.

Variation in propagule and colonization pressures following rapid human-mediated transport: Implications for a universal assemblage-based management model	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent studies have recognized the importance of propagule pressure (number of individuals) and colonization pressure (number of species) for explaining establishment success of nonindigenous species. However, the International Ballast Water Management Convention, when ratified, will require ships to satisfy a numeric discharge standard that focuses only on cumulative propagule pressure of all individuals released. Because of practical constraints, the standard does not differentiate between discharges of single vs. multiple species. The assemblage-based approach, which uses rank-abundance gradients to quantify and manage introduction risk, may compensate for this limitation (e. g., even gradient [relatively consistent propagule pressures among n transported species] or uneven gradient [uneven propagule pressures among n transported species]). Here we explore species abundance distributions of zooplankton during transportation in ballast water to assess variability in the structure of assemblages, with implications for the potential development of an assemblage-based management model. Specifically, we explored species abundance distributions for voyages that lasted, 24 h, those from 24 to 48 h, and those from 48 to 72 h (i.e., three time scales). Species abundance distributions within and across transit time scales were highly variable. As transport time increased, we observed a shift from uneven to even rank-abundance gradients. Owing to variation in assemblage structure, the number of organisms necessary to quantify colonization pressure exhibited similarly strong variation within and across time scales. Our study indicates that assemblage-based approaches to estimate introduction risk are warranted, yet the variation inherent in transported assemblages will induce substantial uncertainty within management models.					; macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Bailey, Sarah/E-8356-2010	Chan, Farrah/0000-0002-1062-6707; Briski, Elizabeta/0000-0003-1896-3860; Bailey, Sarah/0000-0003-3635-919X													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2014	59	6					2068	2076		10.4319/lo.2014.59.6.2068	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2014.59.6.2068													WOS:000345462700020

The highest microcystins (MCs) concentration in water reached 3.4 A mu g L-1. A high beta-ionone concentration reached 35.6 ng L-1 in water. Mean MCs concentration in muscle was highest in omnivorous Carassius auratus (20.9 ng g(-1) dry weight), followed by phytoplanktivorous Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (7.4 ng g(-1) DW) and carnivorous Coilia ectenes (3.0 ng g(-1) DW). The maximum off-flavor concentrations kept 9.5 A mu g kg(-1) wet weight for geosmin (C. auratus), 5.5 A mu g kg(-1) WW for beta-cyclocitral (C. ectenes) and 25.5 A mu g kg(-1) WW for beta-ionone (C. ectenes). Positive correlation was found between the off-flavor and fat contents in C. ectenes. To be different with MCs, beta-cyclocitral content was highest in fore-gut contents (87.6 A mu g kg(-1) WW) in H. molitrix. It should not be reliable to predict odorous compounds level in fish muscle by only measuring the off-flavor in lake water only.

Numerical modeling of the Snowmass Creek paleoglacier, Colorado, and climate in the Rocky Mountains during the Bull Lake glaciation (MIS 6)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Well-preserved moraines from the penultimate, or Bull Lake, glaciation of Snowmass Creek Valley in the Elk Range of Colorado (USA) present an opportunity to examine the character of the high-altitude climate in the Rocky Mountains during Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 6. This study employs a 2-D coupled mass/energy balance and flow model to assess the magnitudes of temperature and precipitation change that could have sustained the glacier in mass-balance equilibrium at its maximum extent during the Bull Lake glaciation. Variable substrate effects on glacier flow and ice thickness make the modeling somewhat more complex than in geologically simpler settings. Model results indicate that a temperature depression of about 6.7 degrees C compared with the present (1971-2000 AD) would have been necessary to sustain the Snowmass Creek glacier in mass-balance equilibrium during the Bull Lake glaciation, assuming no change in precipitation amount or seasonality. A 50% increase or decrease from modern precipitation would have been coupled with 5.2 degrees C and 9.1 degrees C Bull Lake temperature depressions respectively. Uncertainty in these modeled temperature depressions is about 1 degrees C. (C) 2014 University of Washington.

Spatial and temporal analysis of land cover changes and water quality in the Lake Issaqueena watershed, South Carolina	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Monitoring changes in land cover and the subsequent environmental responses are essential for water quality assessment, natural resource planning, management, and policies. Over the last 75 years, the Lake Issaqueena watershed has experienced a drastic shift in land use. This study was conducted to examine the changes in land cover and the implied changes in land use that have occurred and their environmental, water quality impacts. Aerial photography of the watershed (1951, 1956, 1968, 1977, 1989, 1999, 2005, 2006, and 2009) was analyzed and classified using the geographic information system (GIS) software. Seven land cover classes were defined: evergreen, deciduous, bare ground, pasture/grassland, cultivated, and residential/other development. Water quality data, including sampling depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, fecal coliform levels, inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and turbidity, were obtained from the South Carolina (SC) Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) for two stations and analyzed for trends as they relate to land cover change. From 1951 to 2009, the watershed experienced an increase of tree cover and bare ground (+17.4 % evergreen, +62.3 % deciduous, +9.8 % bare ground) and a decrease of pasture/grassland and cultivated land (-42.6 % pasture/grassland and -57.1 % cultivated). From 2005 to 2009, there was an increase of 21.5 % in residential/other development. Sampling depth ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 m. Water temperature fluctuated corresponding to changing air temperatures, and dissolved oxygen content fluctuated as a factor of water temperature. Inorganic nitrogen content was higher from December to April possibly due to application of fertilizers prior to the growing season. Turbidity and fecal coliform bacteria levels remained relatively the same from 1962 to 2005, but a slight decline in pH can be observed at both stations. Prior to 1938, the area consisted of single-crop cotton farms; after 1938, the farms were abandoned, leaving large bare areas with highly eroded soil. Starting in 1938, Clemson reforested almost 30 % of the watershed. Currently, three fourths of the watershed is forestland, with a limited coverage of small farms and residential developments. Monitoring water quality is essential in maintaining adequate freshwater supply. Water quality monitoring focuses mainly on the collection of field data, but current water quality conditions depend on the cumulative impacts of land cover change over time.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2014	186	11					7617	7630		10.1007/s10661-014-3953-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3953-9								25124990					WOS:000343051400048

The influence of flood pulse on fish communities of floodplain canals in the Middle Solimoes River, Brazil	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												The functioning of large river systems with adjacent floodplains is strongly influenced by the flood pulse. This phenomenon is the main structuring force for the biota, including fish communities that use floodplain environments for spawning, feeding, nursery and refuge. In floodplains and in the entire basin, the volume of water controls internal flows. During rising water, the high discharge of the river acts as a natural barrier to the canals that connect floodplain lakes and the Solimoes River, because the water flows from river to lake. During the dry period, there is a reduction of discharge and the water flow is reversed or stationary. These canals are environments with distinct ecological characteristics such as differentiated limnology and water level variation intensely affected by the hydrological cycle. Therefore, we surveyed the influence of the flood pulse on fish communities that inhabit two canals that connect floodplain lakes to the Middle Solimoes River. Particularly, we evaluated the hypothesis that the Solimoes River flow direction is not perfectly parallel to its banks, which creates peripheral flows that direct water from the rivers to the floodplain lake canals. Our analysis indicated that the seasonal pattern is stronger than the spatial. Beside this, we observed that the positions of the canals in relation to the main river flow somehow affect the fish assemblages. Finally, we conclude that the flood pulse is the main structuring force acting on these fish communities.

J	Hugenholtz, CH; Wolfe, SA				Hugenholtz, Chris H.; Wolfe, Stephen A.			Rates and environmental controls of aeolian dust accumulation, Athabasca River Valley, Canadian Rocky Mountains	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Despite an abundance of sedimentary archives of mineral dust (i.e. loess) accumulations from cold, humid environments, the absence of contemporary process investigations limits paleoenvironmental interpretations in these settings. Dust accumulations measured at Jasper Lake, a seasonally-filled reach of the glacially-fed Athabasca River in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, are some of the highest contemporary rates recorded to date. High deposition rates, including a maximum of 27,632 kg ha(-1) month(-1), occur during river low-flow periods, but even the lowest deposition rates, occurring during bankfull periods, exceed other contemporary rates of deposition. High rates of dust deposition may be attributed to geomorphic and climatic controls affecting sediment supply, availability and transport, and biologic factors affecting accumulation. Localized confinement of the Jasper River by tributary river alluvial fans has caused channel expansion upstream, and formation of the shallow depositional basin known as Jasper Lake. This localized sedimentary basin, coupled with large seasonal water level fluctuations and suitably high wind speeds, favors seasonal dust production. In addition, a dense source-proximal coniferous forest stand encourages high dust accumulation, via increased aerodynamic roughness and airflow deceleration. The forest stand also appears to act as an efficient dust filter, with the interception and storage of dust by the forest canopy playing a significant role with regards to secondary fallout and sediment accumulation. Overall, these results provide new insights on the environmental controls of dust entrainment and accumulation in cold, humid settings, and help clarify controls on the formation of Holocene river-sourced loess deposits.

Geographically, high concentrations of GSM were located mainly in the north and northeast culture areas of the lake, while those of 2-MIB were found in the northeast and southwest. Analysis of the water in the enclosure culture revealed significant differences in the concentrations of GSM and 2-MIB among the cultured species. The mean concentrations of GSM in culture water were ranked in the order: crab > the four major Chinese carps > silver and bighead carp, and silver and bighead carp > crab > the four major Chinese carps for 2-MIB. The concentration of GSM was significantly higher at 38.99 +/- 18.93 ng/L in crab culture water compared to other fish culture water. Significant differences were observed in GSM concentrations between crab enclosure culture and pond culture, while 2-MIB levels were comparable. These findings suggest that cultural management practices significantly affect the generation of odor substances. The taste and odor (T&O) assessment revealed that the residual levels of GSM and 2-MIB in most samples were below the odor threshold concentrations (OTCs), although high levels of GSM and 2-MIB in all water bodies were at 30.9% and 27.5%, respectively. Compared with the corresponding data from other places and the regulation guidelines of Japan, USA, and China, the region in the Hongze Lake is generally classified as a slightly T&O area, capable of supporting the aquaculture production scale.

Still, no basin-wide overview of naturally available surface water resources exists up to now. The aim of this study is to estimate these water resources through application of the TRAIN-ZIN model. This hydrological model combines physically-based and conceptual approaches to incorporate dominant processes of (semi-)arid areas in adequate temporal and spatial scale. An adequate space-time resolution is achieved by using rainfall radar data as model input. Three rainfall seasons are simulated: a drought, an average season and a wet extreme. Simulation results emphasize the non-linear behaviour of (semi-)arid systems and resulting impacts on the spatial and temporal variability of water resources. Basin averages of seasonal water balance components ranged between 65 and 489 mm (rainfall), 53 and 270 mm (evapotranspiration), 7 and 87 mm (overland flow), 4 and 129 mm (percolation). However, all values comprise enormous spatial variability. It is concluded that space-time variability must be considered for water resources assessment in the LJRB in order to make accurate predictions of future water availability.

J	Poisson, B; Avouac, JP				Poisson, B; Avouac, JP			Holocene hydrological changes inferred from alluvial stream entrenchment in North Tian Shan (Northwestern China)	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												We analyze the possible contribution of climate change or tectonics on fluvial incision from the study of a case example along the northern flank of Tian Shan. The rivers that exit the high range fed large alluvial fans by the end of the last glacial period. They have since deeply entrenched the piedmont by as much as 300 m. We have surveyed several terraces that were cut and abandoned during river entrenchment, providing information on intermediate positions of the riverbed during downcutting. They suggest a gradual decline in river slope during a major phase of incision throughout the Holocene. Tectonic uplift affects only a zone about 5 km wide, corresponding to a growing anticline, and is shown to account for about 10% of total incision. Incision was therefore most probably driven by climate change. From observed fluvial incision, we estimate the water discharge in excess of that needed to carry the sediments supplied by hillslope erosion in the headwaters. We used a model based on a transport-limited erosion law. The model predicts relaxation process with entrenchment in the upper reach, downstream progradation of the incision-sedimentation line, and a progressive decrease of river slope during incision consistent with our observations. According to this model, river slope might be used as a proxy for specific discharge and then for volumetric discharge, provided that an assumption is made about river width variations. We conclude that river incision in the study area has resulted from dynamic adjustment of the hydrological system to the settlement of wetter conditions in the early Holocene, when water discharge might have been about three times as high as at present. Then, a rather arid climate with enhanced seasonality has likely prevailed from the mid-Holocene (similar to6 ka B. P.) until now.

J	Jepsen, DB; Winemiller, KO				Jepsen, DB; Winemiller, KO			Structure of tropical river food webs revealed by stable isotope ratios	OIKOS												Fish assemblages in tropical river food webs are characterized by high taxonomic diversity, diverse foraging modes, omnivory, and an abundance of detritivores. Feeding links are complex and modified by hydrologic seasonality and system productivity. These properties make it difficult to generalize about feeding relationships and to identify dominant linkages of energy flow. We analyzed the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of 276 fishes and other food web components living in four Venezuelan rivers that differed in basal food resources to determine 1) whether fish trophic guilds integrated food resources in a predictable fashion, thereby providing similar trophic resolution as individual species, 2) whether food chain length differed with system productivity, and 3) how omnivory and detritivory influenced trophic structure within these food webs. Fishes were grouped into four trophic guilds (herbivores, detritivores/algivores, omnivores, piscivores) based on literature reports and external morphological characteristics. Results of discriminant function analyses showed that isotope data were effective at reclassifying individual fish into their pre-identified trophic category. Nutrient-poor, black-water rivers showed greater compartmentalization in isotope values than more productive rivers, leading to greater reclassification success. In three out of four food webs, omnivores were more often misclassified than other trophic groups, reflecting the diverse food sources they assimilated. When fish delta(15)N values were used to estimate species position in the trophic hierarchy, top piscivores in nutrient-poor rivers had higher trophic positions than those in more productive rivers. This was in contrast to our expectation that productive systems would promote longer food chains. Although isotope ratios could not resolve species-level feeding pathways, they did reveal how top consumers integrate isotopic variability occurring lower in the food web. Top piscivores, regardless of species, had carbon and nitrogen profiles less variable than other trophic groups.

A multi-lake study of seasonal variation in lake surface evaporation using MODIS satellite-derived surface temperature	LIMNOLOGY												Knowledge of the evaporative loss from lakes and reservoirs is critical to water resources managers as well as to the overall understanding of the water balance in a given basin, geographical region, or continent. Existing methods for ascertaining evaporation from lakes and reservoirs include point measurements, water balance and mass transfer calculations, and proxy measurements using a pan. Point measurements using the eddy flux covariance method can be accurate, but are resource intensive and unsuited for determining spatial variation over a lake, or for obtaining measurements over many lakes. Mass balance methods cannot provide spatial variability and their accuracy depends on other portions of the water balance that can be challenging to obtain, such as leakage. Similarly, relatively recently deployed scintillation methods provide only an average for a strip across a lake and are also resource intensive and not suited for multi-lake studies. Evaporation pan measurements can also be used, though their accuracy is poor. Herein, we use a combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite measurements of water surface temperature, measurements of wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity from local NWS stations, and a mass transfer method, to demonstrate multi-lake evaporation measurements. Specifically, the seasonal variation in evaporation is obtained for the five major lakes in the Savannah River Basin (in South Carolina, USA): Lakes Jocassee, Keowee, Hartwell, Russell, and Thurmond. Since this approach requires only an existing satellite resource with global coverage and existing NWS stations, this method can potentially be ported to any lake where there is a nearby meteorology station. Hence, this method could be used by both water resource managers and limnologists alike. The possibility is discussed of extending this approach beyond a single basin to encompass an entire geographical region or continent.

J	Visconti, A; Manca, M; De Bernardi, R				Visconti, Anna; Manca, Marina; De Bernardi, Riccardo			Eutrophication-like response to climate warming: an analysis of Lago Maggiore (N. Italy) zooplankton in contrasting years	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Global mean surface temperatures are increasing. All ecosystems are likely to be affected and there is much interest at present in predicting the effects. In freshwater environments, we expect to observe, among other things, effects similar to those observed under eutrophication, such as increases in zooplankton population density and biomass as a result of enhanced population growth rates. Lago Maggiore underwent rapid eutrophication during the 60s and 70s, with a return to oligotrophy during the 80s and the 90s. Thus, it provides a case study to lest the hypothesized eutrophication-like effects of recent climate warming. More specifically, we compare zooplankton biomass and density during the exceptionally warm years of the recent oligotrophic phase with values during the non-warm years of oligotrophy, and during years of the mesotrophic phase. This permits an analysis of zooplankton biomass and density with respect to temperature increase compared with the effects of eutrophication. Zooplankton population density and biomass sharply increased in 2003, the warmest Year of the last century, as a result of Cladocera, particularly Daphnia, attaining values typical of the mesotrophic phase. These values were exceptional compared to typical values and were strongly different from those attained during cooler years since re-oligotrophication. Meat annual values of zooplankton density and biomass recorded in 2003 were fully comparable to typical values during the mesotrophic period. This observation confirms the hypothesis of an overall eutrophication-like effect of climate warming. Seasonal trends, characterized by an earlier start of population growth, arc consistent with the effects of an increase in water temperature, as observed in laboratory experiments on the reproductive and growth strategies of Daphnia.																			1129-5767	1723-8633					2008	67	2					87	92		10.4081/jlimnol.2008.87	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2008.87													WOS:000261475800002

Carbon Dioxide, Oxygen, and Biogenic Elements in Subglacial Water in the Littoral Zone of Southern Baikal (2004-2016)	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS												Results of the annual series of complex measurements of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and biogenic elements in the subglacial water in the littoral zone of the southern area of Lake Baikal, carried out from 2004 to 2016, are analyzed. It was found that the plankton photosynthetic activity significantly decreases the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in water (to 240-350 mu atm) as compared to the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere (about 385 mu atm) by the end of ice cover season. Hence, the CO2 flux can be directed only from the atmosphere to the water surface during the ice breakup in the littoral zone of Southern Baikal.

Mercury in aquatic forage of large herbivores: Impact of environmental conditions, assessment of health threats, and implications for transfer across ecosystem compartments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Mercury (Hg) is a leading contaminant across U.S. water bodies, warranting concern for wildlife species that depend upon food from aquatic systems. The risk of Hg toxicity to large herbivores is little understood, even though some large herbivores consume aquatic vascular plants (macrophytes) that may hyper-accumulate Hg. We investigated whether total Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic forage may be of concern to moose (Alces alces) and beaver (Castor canadensis) by measuring total Hg and MeHg concentrations, calculating sediment-water bioconcentration factors for macrophyte species these herbivores consume, and estimating herbivore daily Hg consumption. Abiotic factors impacting macrophyte Hg were assessed, as was the difference in Hg concentrations of macrophytes from glacial lakes and those created or expanded by beaver damming. The amount of aquatic-derived Hg that moose move from aquatic to terrestrial systems was calculated, in order to investigate the potential for movement of Hg across ecosystem compartments by large herbivores. Results indicate that the Hg exposure of generalist herbivores may be affected by macrophyte community composition more so than by many abiotic factors in the aquatic environment. Mercury concentrations varied greatly between macrophyte species, with relatively high concentrations in Utricularia vulgaris (>80 ng g(-1) in some sites), and negligible concentrations in Nuphar variegata (similar to 6 ng g(-1)). Macrophyte total Hg concentration was correlated with water pH in predictable ways, but not with other variables generally associated with aquatic Hg concentrations, such as dissolved organic carbon. Moose estimated daily consumption of MeHg is equivalent to or below human reference levels, and far below wildlife reference levels. However, estimated beaver Hg consumption exceeds reference doses for humans, indicating the potential for sub-lethal nervous impairment. In regions of high moose density, moose may be ecologically important vectors that transfer Hg from aquatic to surrounding terrestrial systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					SWS European Chapter Meeting on wetland restoration-Challenges and opportunities	JUN 17-21, 2012	Aarhus, DENMARK					The role of water soldier (Stratiotes aloides L.) as a significant habitat for invertebrate fauna was investigated in three oxbow lakes differed by lateral connectivity with the lowland river. The study was conducted in two lotic oxbow lakes of the Slupia River and one oxbow of lentic type in the Drwgca River floodplain (N Poland) within the period of 2008-2009. Hydrological connectivity is a primary factor affecting both abiotic conditions, mainly water trophy, and the faunal structure associated with S. aloides. Overall abundance of epifauna was found to be the highest in standing water (45.1 indiv. kg(-1)) while the lowest in free water flow conditions (25.3 indiv. kg(-1)). The quantitative effect of hydrological connectivity on the faunal composition dwelling S. aloides is significant for Trichoptera larvae which share amounted from 28% for lotic conditions to 39% lentic conditions. Connectivity of an oxbow with the river favours also the density of Isopoda (26-30%). Oxbow isolation increases share of Hirudinea both in terms of density (35%) as well as biomass (58%). The share of Trichoptera larvae in overall biomass predominated the lotic reservoirs (47-53%). Water soldier leaves are a significant substrate for mining larvae. In the lentic oxbow they reached the largest density but the highest biomass was stated in the flow-through oxbow lake. Despite of differences in zoocenotic indices among the three oxbows, no statistical significance was stated (p = 0.05). The highest biodiversity on the leaves of water soldier was recorded for the guild of predators, particularly in the oxbow lake with controlled water flow. Scrapers were the only persistent guild. Based on canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) the density of epifauna guilds we found to be depended on water quality, hydrological conditions, season and water soldier biomass (WSB). Similarly, the variability of guilds' biomass was explained primarily by water aeration and nutrients (TP, PO4-P) availability. The regulation of abiotic conditions undergoes the processes of water exchange between an oxbow and the main river channel, and thus it is a main factor which alter the qualitative and quantitative structure of epiphytic fauna inhabiting S. abides.

Monitoring the water balance of seepage lakes to track regional responses to an evolving climate	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Understanding the causes of large fluctuations in lake water levels is important for adaptive resource management. The relatively simple water budgets of small seepage lakes make them potentially useful model systems, provided that key water balance components can be well constrained. Here, spatial variability in measured rates of evaporation (E) and precipitation (P) at the whole lake scale was investigated, and the effect on daily and seasonal water balance estimates was quantified. To estimate spatial variability, triplicate sensor platforms were deployed on and near an 18 ha seepage lake. Lake stage (S) was monitored at a single node in the lake. The water balance was closed by estimating net groundwater seepage (G(net)) analytically as G(net) = Delta S - (P - E). Instrumentation on a second seepage lake was maintained by citizen scientists to assess the potential for more widespread sensor deployments. Data were collected at 30-minute time steps for six months. The results indicate that low-cost sensor networks with single nodes to measure E, P, and Delta S provide well-constrained water budgets at daily and seasonal time scales.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	2022	79	7					1056	1063		10.1139/cjfas-2021-0217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2021-0217		DEC 2021											WOS:000788294300001

However, the distribution and risk of MCs in subtropical reservoirs in China are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the MCs pollution in seven subtropical reservoirs in Fujian Province, China. The results showed that most samples (87.74%) from all reservoirs were in a mesotrophic state during the survey period, and a variety of potential toxigenic cyanobacteria were detected, which resulted in the detection rate of MCs reaching 100%. The MCs concentration of surface samples ranged from 0.19 to 1.06 mu g/L, and the proportion of MC-YR (43.72%) was the highest, followed by MC-RR (37.88%). The maximum was usually obtained in warmer seasons. The MCs concentration in stratified water samples ranged from 0.20 to 0.54 mu g/L, while the MCs concentration in bottom water samples was sometimes higher than that in surface samples. MCs were positively correlated with most of the physicochemical parameters and the densities of phytoplankton phyla, but only negatively correlated with water depth, total nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. MCs concentration was significantly positively correlated with the density of Microcystis and Cylindrospermopsis. Finally, risk assessments of MCs indicate that the risk from MCs pollution in all reservoirs studied remains low, particularly to humans. However, since the reservoir has different community compositions of toxin-producing cyanobacteria from that of shallow lakes, the long-term and regular monitoring and study of cyanotoxins should be strengthened in future under a changing climate.

Concentration of heavy metals was measured by mass spectrometry, chlorophyll by spectrophotometry, bacteria abundance by DAPI staining, secondary production by 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA and enzymatic activities using fluorescence-labelled substrate methods. Concentrations of all the analysed heavy metals, chlorophyll, as well as the number of heterotrophic bacteria and the level of enzymatic activity were higher in the SML than in subsurface water. No differences in the total number of bacteria in both the studied layers were noted. The rate of secondary production of planktonic bacteria was found to be higher than that of neustonic bacteria. Seasonal variability was observed in the studied chemical and microbiological parameters. It was found that in SML heavy metal concentrations increased in relation to those in subsurface water. However, this did not reduce the level of chlorophyll, heterotrophic bacteria, or the enzymatic activity. In contrast, increased heavy metal concentrations in SML reduced total number of bacteria and the level of secondary productivity.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2015	762	1					65	80		10.1007/s10750-015-2337-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2337-7													WOS:000364635100006

A strong seasonality of biomarkers was characteristic for the different fractions, particularly the variations in the 18:4(n - 3) and 20:4(n - 3) fatty acids and the delta C-13 values. The primary production in the lake was mainly driven by diatoms, reflected by the close relation of delta C-13, chlorophyll a and diatom fatty acid markers. The combined approach of delta C-13 and 20:4(n - 3) enabled processes in the lipid metabolism of the copepod Boeckella poopoensis to be inferred. The polyunsaturated fatty acid 22:6(n - 3) and the delta N-15 separated the trophic levels in this food web with copepods at higher trophic level. Nutritional stress and omnivory of B. poopoensis partially explained the delta N-15 variations in mesozooplankton. The delta N-15 signature was probably driven by cyanobacteria in the microplankton and by microbial processes in the nanoplankton fraction. Warmer temperatures may favour the saturation of microalgae fatty acids and the abundance of plankton groups richer in saturated fatty acids. The tendency to unsaturation in mesozooplankton at colder temperatures was probably influenced by diet and metabolic requirements. Future temperature increase and eutrophication-like processes may increase the importance of cyanobacterial and bacterial markers under climate change scenarios.

The research aims to improve our understanding of distribution, scenarios, and location-specific probability distribution of rainfall in the basin. Dekadal variability and trends were constructed and analysed using a geographic information system geoprocessing tool. There is a good correlation between the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM 3B43) monthly rainfall and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) gauge with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) Rainfall Estimate (RFE), Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (eMODIS) normalized difference vegetation index images, global net primary production (NPP) anomaly, and standard precipitation index (SPI) were characterized. Results indicate an increase in NPP and SPI values from 2002 to 2011, which supports the theory of recent greening of the Sahel. Autocorrelation analysis identified a very high drought index at the northernmost part of LCB (proximal to the Sahara Desert) with the northern part of LCB characterized as low-low, suggesting more likelihood of low rainfall, and southeast and southwest portions as high-low, suggesting a decrease in likelihood of high precipitation northward. This provides vital information to farmers and relevant authorities for making educated decisions in poor rainy seasons. The statistical coefficient of variance and rainfall average also provide crucial information on region-specific rainfall needs for crop production.

Feeding habits of giant otters Pteronura brasiliensis (Carnivora: Mustelidae) in the Balbina hydroelectric reservoir, Central Brazilian Amazon	ZOOLOGIA												This study aimed to identify the diet of giant otters, Pteronura brasiliensis (Zimmermann, 1780) in the Balbina reservoir (01 degrees 55'S, 59 degrees 29'W), to compare it with literature data on the diet of giant otters from non-dammed areas, and to verify the effects of the seasonal changes in water levels on the feeding habits of Balbina otters. A total of 254 feces samples were collected and identified according to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Teleostei fish were present in 100% of the samples; two samples also presented monkey fur (n = 1) and sloth fur (n = 1), suggesting that the diet of P brasiliensis, in the reservoir, is almost exclusively based on fish. Ten fish families were identified in our samples, six of which were exclusive to the Balbina Lake (not present in the diet of giant otters from non-dammed areas). These six fish families, however, were present in less than 3% of the samples. The fish families with highest representation in the diet of giant otters from non-dammed areas also appeared with higher frequencies in the Balbina Lake, suggesting that the otters have not changed their diet substantially after the implementation of the reservoir. During the high-water period, when the fish are dispersed into the flooded forest and are not very easy to catch, the otters seem to have an opportunistic feeding habit. By contrast, during the low-water period, when prey items are widely available and easier to catch in the reservoir, their feeding habits are more selective.

A combination of analytical techniques was used to characterize the elemental and ionic composition of the aerosol. Major particle types larger than similar to0.5 mm were identified by electron and light microscopy. Both the coarse and fine aerosol were found to consist primarily of organic matter (similar to70 and 80% by mass, respectively), with the coarse fraction containing small amounts of soil dust and sea-salt particles and the fine fraction containing some non-sea-salt sulfate. Coarse particulate mass concentrations (CPM approximate to PM10 - PM2) were found to be highest at night (average = 3.9 +/- 1.4 mg m(-3), mean night-to-day ratio = 1.9 +/- 0.4), while fine particulate mass concentrations (FPM approximate to PM2) increased during the daytime (average = 2.6 +/- 0.8 mg m(-3), mean night-to-day ratio = 0.7 +/- 0.1). The nocturnal increase in CPM coincided with an increase in primary biological particles in this size range (predominantly yeasts and other fungal spores), resulting from the trapping of surface-derived forest aerosol under a shallow nocturnal boundary layer and a lake-land breeze effect at the site, although active nocturnal sporulation may have also contributed. Associated with this, we observed elevated nighttime concentrations of biogenic elements and ions (P, S, K, Cu, Zn, NH4+) in the CPM fraction. For the FPM fraction a persistently higher daytime concentration of organic carbon was found, which indicates that photochemical production of secondary organic aerosol from biogenic volatile organic compounds may have made a significant contribution to the fine aerosol. Dust and sea-salt-associated elements/ions in the CPM fraction, and non-sea-salt sulfate in the FPM fraction, showed higher daytime concentrations, most likely due to enhanced convective downward mixing of long-range transported aerosol.

How well can the fatty acid content of lake seston be predicted from its taxonomic composition?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Results from the few field studies that have tried to relate seston taxonomic and fatty acid (FA) composition suggest that phytoplankton composition only partially explains seston FA composition. However, in these studies, the heterotrophic components of seston (i.e. bacteria and heterotrophic protists) have not been accounted for. 2. The general premise of this article was that including the contribution of heterotrophs to seston biomass can improve understanding of the variability in seston FA composition. This was tested for an oligotrophic clearwater lake, in which the taxonomic and FA compositions of seston, fractionated into three size classes, were monitored every 2 weeks over a growth season. The relationship between seston taxonomic and FA composition was studied using canonical correlation analyses. 3. Because of their relative richness in branched FA and lack of highly unsaturated FAs (HUFA) compared to autotrophs and other protists, the contribution of bacteria to seston biomass was shown to explain an important part of the differences in FA composition between the different seston size classes. Phytoplankton seasonal succession also affected the FA composition of seston but only for size classes that were dominated by autotrophs. 4. The results also indicated that heterotrophic protists such as ciliates and heterotrophic nanoflagellates might substantially influence the seston FA, and especially, HUFA, composition. 5. The per cent of variability in seston FA composition that was explained by its taxonomic composition was still relatively low, even when taking account of heterotrophs. Hence, other possible influences, such as phytoplankton species composition, physiological state and the contribution of terrestrial detritus, need investigation.

J	Hodson, A				Hodson, Andy			Biogeochemistry of snowmelt in an Antarctic glacial ecosystem	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Solute mass balance, hydrochemical data, and hydrological process data are used to present the first detailed account of catchment biogeochemistry in an Antarctic melt season. The study was undertaken in a small glacial catchment in the maritime Antarctic (Signy Island, South Orkney Islands), where extreme ecosystem changes have been observed at the ice margin. Here melting caused a snowpack solute elution phase characterized by the production of extremely concentrated solutions just centimeters from the snow surface. These were equivalent to 2% marine water and dominated by sea-salt aerosol. Nutrients were also present but were rapidly sequestered in snowpack and ice marginal environments. Thus the decoupling of nutrient dynamics from other snowpack solutes seems to occur almost immediately after melt and testifies to the presence of a glacial ecosystem. Although significant, the estimated rates of nutrient uptake were low (0.025 gNH(4)-N/m(2)/yr and 0.0011 gPO(4)-P/m(2)/yr, equivalent to 66 and 74% of total annual atmospheric inputs) and, in the case of NH4+, 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported for temperate snowpacks. However, the data also demonstrated significant NO3- production (0.030 gNO(3)-N/m(2)/yr or 3 times total atmospheric inputs) that appears to be associated with zones of high rock-water contact at the ice margin. After the early snowpack elution phase, nutrient cycling was also greatly influenced by inputs from penguin and seal excreta. Thus local marine ecosystems enhance the nutrient content of meltwaters and fertilize the glacial, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems that are responding to climate change in the maritime Antarctic.																			0043-1397					NOV 8	2006	42	11							W11406	10.1029/2005WR004311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005WR004311													WOS:000241987000001

The results revealed that they are ranked in the following decreasing order: Fe > Al > Cr > Mn > V > Zn > Ni > Pb > As > Cu > Cd > Sb > Hg. Geoaccumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF) and pollution load Index (PLI) were used to estimate the impact of anthropogenic activities on the quality of the sediments. The values of these indices showed that sediments are highly contaminated mainly with Cd, Cr, As and are of anthropogenic origin.																			0275-7540	1029-0370				JAN 2	2022	38	1					72	94		10.1080/02757540.2021.2013475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2021.2013475		DEC 2021											WOS:000729738400001

Spatial and temporal variation in meat and fish consumption among people in the western Serengeti, Tanzania: the importance of migratory herbivores	ORYX												Illegal bushmeat hunting has become a serious problem for wildlife managers in many African countries. We investigated the spatial and temporal pattern in meat and fish consumption by people surrounding the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, to understand better the links between hunting and consumption. We studied 150 households in five villages during March-December 2006 along a gradient from the Park boundary to 80 km away. In addition, two parallel 10 km transects were monitored monthly in areas within the National Park immediately adjoining three village areas to investigate the relationship between household meat consumption and the influx of migratory herbivores. We found that the number of meat meals was higher in the villages closest to the Park boundary and the weekly number of meat meals per household in all villages within 30 km of the Park boundary increased with the seasonal influx of migratory herbivores. Meat consumption was unrelated to household income except in the most distant village where there was a positive correlation. The number of fish meals in the villages closest to the Park decreased with the influx of migratory herbivores. We recommend a coordinated management of fish harvesting from Lake Victoria and wildlife conservation around the Serengeti National Park to implement sustainable management of these two ecologically different sources of animal protein.

Climate-driven shifts in quantity and seasonality of river discharge over the past 1000 years from the hydrographic apex of North America	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Runoff generated from high elevations is the primary source of freshwater for western North America, yet this critical resource is managed on the basis of short instrumental records that capture an insufficient range of climatic conditions. Here we probe the effects of climate change over the past similar to 1000 years on river discharge in the upper Mackenzie River system based on paleoenvironmental information from the Peace-Athabasca Delta. The delta landscape responds to hydroclimatic changes with marked variability, while Lake Athabasca level appears to directly monitor overall water availability. The latter fluctuated systematically over the past millennium, with the highest levels occurring in concert with maximum glacier extent during the Little Ice Age, and the lowest during the 11th century, prior to medieval glacier expansion. Recent climate-driven hydrological change appears to be on a trajectory to even lower levels as high-elevation snow and glacier meltwater contributions both continue to decline. Citation: Wolfe, B.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on lakes' spatial and temporal changes in this region. This information is crucial for understanding the risk magnitude and designing strategies. To fill this research gap, we analyzed 89,480 Landsat images from 1977 +/- 2 to 2020 +/- 2 to investigate the changes in the size of lakes recharged by the AWT. Our findings showed that out of the 209 lakes larger than 50 km2, 176 (84 %) grew during the wet season and 167 (81 %) during the dry season. 74 % of expanded lakes are located in the Inner Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Tarim basins. The lakes that shrank are found mainly in the Helmand, Indus, and Yangtze basins. Over the entire period, the area of shrinkage (55,077.028 km2 in wet season, 53,986.796 km2 in dry) markedly exceeded expansion (13,000.267 km2 in wet, 11,038.805 km2 in dry), with the drastic decline of the Aral Sea being a major contributor to shrinkage, accounting for 90 % of the total loss. From 1990 +/- 2 to 2020 +/- 2, alpine lakes mostly expanded, plain lakes mostly shrank, with the opposite trend from 1977 +/- 2 to 1990 +/- 2. Glacial loss and permafrost thawing under global warming in the Inner TP, Tarim Interior, Syr Darya, and Mekong basins were strongly correlated with lake expansion. However, permafrost discontinuities may prevent significant growth of lakes in the Indus and Ganges basins despite increased recharge. Our findings point to the prominence of the risk the lakes recharged by AWT face. Taking immediate action to manage these risks and adaptation is crucial as the AWT retreats and lake recharges are slowed.

VARIATION IN HELMINTH PARASITE COMPONENT COMMUNITIES OF GAMBUSIA AFFINIS	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												In north-central Texas streams, seasonal changes in ambient temperature and rainfall result in dynamic variation in microhabitat structure, affecting the distribution and abundance of hosts. Since the complex life cycles of parasites require the presence and interaction of multiple hosts, the seasonal variations in microhabitats could influence parasite component communities within these ecosystems. Gambusia affinis (western mosquitofish) serves as a host for a variety of larval and adult parasites. Factors that affect helminth component communities in populations of mosquitofish from the Paluxy River were investigated in this study. Gambusia affinis individuals were collected from 3 sites monthly from June 2015 through August 2016. All helminth parasites were collected during necropsy and subsequently identified. From 495 mosquitofish, 5,283 helminths were collected. Component community diversity varied among collection sites and collection dates and was positively influenced by river flow. These results indicate that helminth assemblages infecting mosquitofish in the Paluxy River vary through time and space, as well as in response to environmental variation (i.e., changes in water flow).																			0022-3395	1937-2345				JUN	2020	106	2					247	253		10.1645/18-69	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/18-69								32206794					WOS:000552901700006
J	Timms, BV				Timms, BV			Salt lakes in Australia: present problems and prognosis for the future	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Australia is a land of salt lakes and despite low human population density, many lakes are adversely impacted by a range of factors. Secondary salinisation is the most pernicious force degrading lakes, especially in south-west Western Australia where up to 30% of the landscape is predicted to be affected. Mining also impinges on many salt lakes in this state, mainly through the dewatering of saline groundwater. Exploitation of groundwater for irrigation caused some lakes in Victoria, Australia, to dry, especially the significant Red Rock Complex. Global climate change will result in new water balances in endorheic lakes, with most having less water, particularly the seasonal lakes of southern Australia. This has already happened in Lake Corangamite, Victoria, but the prime reason is diversion of inflowing floodwater. Consequently, the lake has retreated and become salinised compromising its status as a Ramsar site. Various other lakes suffer from enhanced sedimentation, have introduced biota or their catchments are being disturbed to their detriment. Enlightened management should be able to maintain some important lakes in an acceptable condition, but, for most others, the future is bleak.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC 1	2005	552						1	15		10.1007/s10750-005-1501-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1501-x													WOS:000233567800002
J	Cenderelli, DA; Wohl, EE				Cenderelli, DA; Wohl, EE			Flow hydraulics and geomorphic effects of glacial-lake outburst floods in the Mount Everest region, Nepal	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Glacial-lake outburst floods (GLOFs) on 3 September 1977 and 4 August 1985 dramatically modified channels and valleys in the Mount Everest region of Nepal by eroding, transporting, and depositing large quantities of sediment for tens of kilometres along the flood routes. The GLOF discharges were 7 to 60 times greater than normal floods derived from snowmelt runoff, glacier meltwater, and monsoonal precipitation (referred to as seasonal high flow floods, SHFFs). Specific stream power values ranged from as low as 1900 W m(-2) in wide, low-gradient valley segments to as high as 51700 W m(-2) in narrow, high-gradient valley segments bounded by bedrock. Along the upper 16 km of the GLOF routes, the reach-averaged specific stream power of the GLOFs was 3(.)2 to 8(.)0 times greater than the reach-averaged specific stream power of the SHFFs. The greatest geomorphic change occurred along the upper 10 to 16 km of the GLOF routes, where the ratio between the GLOF specific stream power and the SHFF specific stream power was the greatest, there was an abundant supply of sediment, and channel/valley boundaries consisted primarily of unconsolidated sediment. Below 11 to 16 km from the source area, the geomorphic effects of the GLOFs were reduced because of the lower specific stream power ratio between the GLOFs and SHFFs, more resistant bedrock flow boundaries, reduced sediment supply, and the occurrence of past GLOFs.

J	Platt, NH; Matter, A				Platt, Nigel H.; Matter, Albert			Sedimentology of the Jura Molasse: Miocene tidal clastics and freshwater carbonates from the Tramelan-2 Borehole, NW Switzerland	SWISS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The Tramelan-2 borehole (Canton Bern, Switzerland) continuously cored a 275.60 m sequence of Palaeogene to Neogene sediments, providing a rare opportunity for sedimentological analysis of the Jura Molasse. Lithostratigraphy, sedimentary facies and heavy minerals allow correlation with the classical Swiss Molasse. Evidence for clastic input from Alpine and non-Alpine sources is consistent with deposition at the northern feather edge of the Molasse Basin. Grey sandstones at the base of the succession are tentatively interpreted as fluvial facies of the Lower Freshwater Molasse (USM). These are overlain by erosively-based conglomerates, interpreted as winnowed storm lags of locally-derived clasts and distantly-sourced Alpine material at the transgressive base of the Upper Marine Molasse (OMM). Above this, a range of plane-laminated and cross-bedded bioclastic sandstones are interpreted as the deposits of a meso- or macrotidal flat or estuarine complex. Facies evolution in the upper OMM records a series of stacked regressive cycles within an overall upward trend of reducing current energy, reflecting a transition from offshore to nearshore shallow marine environments. The unconformably overlying Upper Freshwater Molasse (OSM) passes upwards from micaceous siltstones and marls into a series of freshwater carbonates, dominated by lacustrine limestones which are arranged in repeated regressive cycles, each capped by organic-rich horizons. The middle part of the carbonate interval comprises palustrine limestones with pedogenetic fabrics recording periodic subaerial exposure. Stable isotope signatures from the palustrine facies reflect subaerial pedogenetic overprint, while the lacustrine carbonates record cyclical variations in & delta;C-13 which may reflect increases in organic material during progressive lake fill and/or an increased influence of aquifer waters during flooding events. The Jura Molasse onlapped a Mesozoic carbonate pediment hosting a regional karst system which remained active at least until the Burdigalian transgression on footwall highs bounding the Delemont Basin, and locally into the Langhian near Tramelan. This configuration controlled subsequent deposition of OSM carbonates which onlapped erosional and potentially early tectonic relief, and were deposited in groundwater-fed seasonal lacustrine/palustrine environments, where the karstic aquifer controls on seasonal hydrology appear to have been comparable to Caribbean freshwater carbonate wetland systems today.					; Platt, Nigel/NAZ-8174-2025	Platt, Nigel H/0000-0002-1131-0704; 													1661-8726	1661-8734				DEC	2023	116	1							11	10.1186/s00015-023-00436-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s00015-023-00436-1													WOS:001039587500001
J	Suriano, ZJ; Loewy, C; Uz, J				Suriano, Zachary J.; Loewy, Charles; Uz, Jamie			Synoptic Climatology of Central US Snowfall	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Prior research evaluating snowfall conditions and temporal trends in the United States often acknowledges the role of various synoptic-scale weather systems in governing snowfall variability. While synoptic classifications have been performed in other regions of North America in applications to snowfall, there remains a need for enhanced under-standing of the atmospheric mechanisms of snowfall in the central United States. Here we conduct a novel synoptic clima-tological investigation of the weather systems responsible for snowfall in the central United States from 1948 to 2021 focused on their identification and the quantification of associated snowfall totals and events. Ten unique synoptic weather types (SWTs) were identified, each resulting in distinct regions of enhanced snowfall across the study domain aligning with regions of sufficiently cold air temperatures and forcing mechanisms. While a substantial proportion of seasonal snowfall is attributed to SWTs associated with surface troughs and/or midlatitude cyclones, in portions of the southeastern and west-ern study domain, as much as 70% of seasonal snowfall occurs during systems with high pressure centers as the domain's synoptic-scale forcing. Easterly flow, potentially resulting in topographic uplift from high pressure to east of the domain, was associated with between 15% and 25% of seasonal snowfall in Nebraska and South Dakota. On average, 64.8% of the SWT occurrences resulted in snowfall within the study region, ranging between 40.1% and 93.5% by SWT. Synoptic climatological investigations provide valuable insights into the unique weather systems that generate hydroclimatic variability. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: By evaluating the weather patterns that are responsible for snowfall in the central United States, key insights can be gained into how and why snowfall varies and potentially changes over space and time. Using an approach that categorizes weather patterns based on their similarities, here 10 unique snowfall-producing weather patterns are identified and analyzed from 1948 to 2021. Each pattern resulted in different snowfall amounts across the central United States, varying substantially spatially and within the calendar year. Approximately 65% of the time that these weather patterns occur, snowfall is observed in the region. The majority of snowfall-producing weather patterns are associated with low pressure systems, but in some regions up to 70% of snowfall is associated with instances of high pressure in which winds can cause upward motions associated with topography.

However, the generation of water pollutant loads at high resolution and the life-cycle pathway of them from sources, through pipelines and wastewater treatment plants, finally to recipient water bodies remain unclear. This study aims to establish a process-based Water Pollutant Loads Tracking model and applies it to a rapidly urbanizing watershed in Taihu Lake Basin, China at the resolution of 5 m x 5 m in 2017, whose terrain is flat, slowly lowing from west to east. Results show that, of 261.55 tons of the total phosphorus (TP) generation, 71.28% is collected, and 64.32% is treated, with only 26.46% discharged to the water bodies and 1.25% to the target ones. The spatial hotspots of TP generation are mainly concentrated in residential and industrial areas. Direct discharges from point sources and nonpoint runoffs, especially in rainy seasons, are recognized as the main challenges for local water pollution control. The main innovation of this study is to quantify the generation of water pollutant loads at high resolution and to trace the subsequent pathway to collection and discharge, and then to identify the potential substantial gap between generation and discharge, demonstrating the efficacy and broader applicability of this model. A process-based mass balance model is developed to quantify the generation pattern of water pollutant loads at high resolutionThe model is a reliable tool for tracing water pollutants from sources to recipient water bodies without any topographic limitationSubstantial positive gap between generation and discharge indicates the effectiveness of local pollution control measures					Zhuang, Yujie/ODJ-1764-2025; Yuan, Zengwei/B-9283-2014	Zhuang, Yujie/0000-0001-6467-7780; Yuan, Zengwei/0000-0002-6533-4170; Liu, Xin/0000-0003-3336-2019													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2023	59	12							e2023WR034738	10.1029/2023WR034738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR034738													WOS:001113443700001

Water quality changes in floodplain lakes due to the Amazon River flood pulse: Lago Grande de Curuai (Para)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Assurance of water quality for human consumption is essential for public health policies. In the Amazon floodplain, the seasonal water level variation causes periodic flooding of marginal areas that are usually used for settlements, agriculture and livestock. Therefore, the exchange of materials between the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem affects the proportion of suspended and dissolved components in water and its physical-chemical characteristics, and consequently the quality of the water used by local people. Following this approach, the aim of this study is to evaluate changes in water quality in Lago Grande de Curuai floodplain, Obidos, Para in response to the flood pulse, during one hydrological year from 2003 to 2004, based on water use classes (according to National Water Agency 357/2005 resolution) using chlorophyll-alpha and dissolved oxygen concentration as parameters and the eutrophication index. Ordinary kriging was applied to interpolate chlorophyll-alpha and dissolved oxygen and to predict values at non sampled locations. Each location was then classified according to water use acceptable parameters and to Carlson Trophic State Index modified by Toledo to map lake water classes and trophic status. The result showed that Lago Grande de Curuai floodplain is a supereutrophic system, with levels of dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-alpha not suitable for human supply during the receding water phase. These areas are located near the riverine communities, which can cause health problems due to the presence of potentially toxic algae. Therefore, monitoring water quality in Amazon lakes is essential to ensure the availability has appropriate quality for human and animal supplies.

An integrative approach was proposed concerning the mobility of carbohydrates, proteins and phenol among water, sediments and macrophytes in relation to the physical, chemical and geochemical parameters of Lake Mariout. Total carbohydrates, proteins and phenol showed averages of 6.80 mg L-1, 116.90 mg L(-1)and 19.46 mu g L-1; 89.82 mg g(-1); 29.21 mg g(-1)and 1.80 mu gg(-1); and 60.80 mg g(-1), 15.27 mg g(-1)and 9.29 mg g(-1)in water, sediments and macrophytes, respectively. Protein/carbohydrate ratios in sediments were used as the trophic indicator. This study cleared out that all stations had ratios (<1) refereeing to aged organic matter. Station 6 indicated fresh organic matter. Moreover, the ratio of total organic carbon to total nitrogen (TOC/TN) suggested a primarily marine origin at eleven stations (<10) and a mixture of terrestrial input and marine materials (>10) at stations 1 and 7 located in the North-West Basin. Relatively high phenol concentrations of 54.5, 38.25 and 45.37 mu gL(-1)in water were measured at stations (3 & 5) located in the Main Basin, and station 11 located at El-Qalaa drain, respectively. The partition coefficient of phenol (K-d) varied from 0.053 to 0.199 (<1 Lg(-1)) revealing high mobility and an underground disposal facility. The low biodiversity of phytoplankton (38 spp.), seagrasses (5 spp.) and seaweed (5 spp.) inside the lake reflected the impact of wastewater discharged. Two phytoplankton blooms were observed at stations 3 and 7. According to the Diversity Index of Boyd, all Mariout stations (<4) are moderately polluted. Multivariate analyses were adopted to describe the lake chemistry. This study gives a conceptual framework helps decision-makers to express the problem of sustainability at Lake Mariout.					; Ismail, Mona/ABD-2473-2020; Elsayed/ADR-1673-2022	Ismail, Mona M./0000-0001-7029-6802; El-Sayed, Abeer/0000-0002-8720-086X													0306-7319	1029-0397				NOV 14	2022	102	14					3316	3342		10.1080/03067319.2020.1767094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2020.1767094		MAY 2020											WOS:000541275100001

In this study, we tested the latter by studying size- and temporal hydrology-related shifts in the diet of shortjaw tapertail anchovy Coilia brachygnathus (Actinopterygii, Engraulidae) from Lake Poyang. During the wet season, delta C-13 values ranged from -28.2aEuro degrees for small anchovies to -24.6aEuro degrees for larger individuals, but delta N-15 ranged from 18.9aEuro degrees for smaller fish to 12.4aEuro degrees for larger fish. Significant C-13-enrichment and N-15-depletion occurred with increasing size, revealing that different carbon sources were used as the fish grew. Given the high hydrologic fluctuation levels, significant differences in delta C-13 values were observed among larger anchovies between seasons, indicating a temporal dietary shift. Anchovies fed primarily on shrimp and fish during the low-water season despite the predominance of zooplankton during the two seasons studied, which indicated increased piscivorous reliance. C. brachygnathus exhibited higher delta N-15 values during the wet season because the food items were N-15-enriched. Human waste brought by floods could be another possible interpretation. Considering C. brachygnathus is an important link between plankton production and higher piscivorous trophic levels, changes in the species are expected to affect the functioning of lake food webs along the trophic pathway.					zhang, huan/MSW-4327-2025; Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020														0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2013	703	1					247	256		10.1007/s10750-012-1370-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1370-z													WOS:000312782000019

Fatty acids (FAs) were combined with environmental descriptors and analyzed through multivariate and spatial tools (asymmetric eigenvector maps, AEM and principal coordinates of neighbor matrices, PCNM). This challenge allowed investigating the distribution of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), in order to trace its seasonal origin and quality, along a 800 km section of the Amazon river-floodplain system. Statistical analysis confirmed that large amounts of saturated FAs (15: 0, 18: 0, 24: 0, 25: 0 and 26: 0), an indication of refractory OM, were concomitantly recorded with high pCO(2) in rivers, during the high water season (HW). Contrastingly, FAs marker which may be attributed in this ecosystem to aquatic plants (18:2 omega 6 and 18:3 omega 3) and cyanobacteria (16:1 omega 7), were correlated with higher O-2, chlorophyll a and pheopigments in floodplains, due to a high primary production during low waters (LW). Decreasing concentrations of unsaturated FAs, that characterize labile OM, were recorded during HW, from upstream to downstream. Furthermore, using PCNM and AEM spatial methods, FAs compositions of SPOM displayed an upstream-downstream gradient during HW, which was attributed to OM retention and the extent of flooded forest in floodplains. Discrimination of OM quality between the Amazon River and floodplains corroborate higher autotrophic production in the latter and transfer of OM to rivers at LW season. Together, these gradients demonstrate the validity of FAs as predictors of spatial and temporal changes in OM quality. These spatial and temporal trends are explained by 1) downstream change in landscape morphology as predicted by the River Continuum Concept; 2) enhanced primary production during LW when the water level decreased and its residence time increased as predicted by the Flood Pulse Concept.					; Meziane, Tarik/AAF-7906-2020; Bernardes, Marcelo/H-7869-2012; Abril, Gwenaël/C-7835-2011; Ferreira, Miguel/KEJ-0947-2024; mortillaro, Jean-Michel/A-2496-2012	Rigal, Francois/0000-0001-6882-1591; Abril, Gwenael/0000-0002-4914-086X; Bernardes, Marcelo/0000-0002-4338-4353; Mortillaro, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-1911-9338; MEZIANE, Tarik/0000-0003-2142-6441													1932-6203					SEP 28	2012	7	9							e46141	10.1371/journal.pone.0046141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0046141								23029412					WOS:000309973900094

The influence of environmental parameters on spatial variation in zoobenthic density and stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S) within a large lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The use of baselines in stable isotope studies to interpret food web structure is essential, but baseline isotope values are often assumed to be spatially homogeneous, even in large aquatic ecosystems. To test this assumption in large lakes, we quantified spatial variation in delta C-13, delta N-15 (deposit-feeding Oligochaeta and filter-feeding Dreissena spp.), and delta S-34 (Dreissena spp. only) and density in Lake Erie between 2014 and 2016. Lake Erie's three distinct basins differ in size, bathymetry, and nutrient loading, making it an excellent system for exploring spatial variation in stable isotopes of baseline organisms. Dreissena spp. densities were highest in the western and lowest in the seasonally hypoxic central basin, while Oligochaeta densities were relatively consistent throughout Lake Erie. Values of delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 exhibited distinct spatial trends that were not related to population densities but followed the west to east direction of water flow within the lake. For both taxa, delta C-13 was lower in the deeper, oligotrophic east basin than the shallow, mesotrophic west basin, and delta N-15 and delta S-34 increased from west to east. Spatial patterns of low delta S-34 in Dreissena spp. in the western and central basins were likely related to hypoxia, whereas patterns of delta N-15 in both taxa were probably related to the greater influence of agricultural land uses in the western basin. Spatial trends of stable isotopes in large lake zoobenthos are driven by complex interactions of environmental gradients, which could introduce bias in evaluations of trophic structures within aquatic ecosystems that use stable isotopes.					; Heuvel, Cecilia/MTF-8266-2025; Ciborowski, Jan/AAC-8247-2019	Heuvel, Cecilia/0000-0003-3999-2919; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2024	69	1					173	188		10.1002/lno.12466	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12466		NOV 2023											WOS:001109788900001

Net groundwater inflow in an enclosed lake: from synoptic variations to climatic projections	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Using lake Stechlin in northeastern Germany as an example of a small groundwater-feed lake without surface inflows and outflows, we estimated the temporal scales and the variability ranges of the net groundwater contribution to the lake water budget. High-resolution water level measurements by a bottom-mounted pressure logger provided the background for the estimation of the total lake water budget. This method has demonstrated reliability for estimation of lake level variations during periods ranging from subdiurnal to perennial. The typical amplitudes of the synoptic-to-perennial variability characterizing the groundwater climate of lake Stechlin are estimated by comparing the two subsequent years 2006 and 2007; one of these years shows an extremely high, and the other an extremely low, annual precipitation-evaporation balance. The net groundwater flow, estimated as the difference between the total water budget and the precipitation-evaporation balance at the surface, revealed synoptic effects of lake water exfiltration into the groundwater aquifer following strong precipitation events. Perennial variations between wet and dry years superimposed seasonal oscillations. The probable origin of the latter is seasonality in the groundwater level on the watershed, although the exact amplitudes are subject to further quantification on account of seasonality in the evaporation estimation error. The results emphasize the non-stationary behaviour of groundwater flow on timescales shorter than climatic ones. The analysis yielded a net quantitative relationship between groundwater flow and water balance at the lake surface: The water level changes in the lake due to evaporation and precipitation are damped to 60% because of the lake-groundwater exchange by means of intermittent infiltration and exfiltration events. Assuming the remaining 40% of the surface water budget may potentially result in perennial water level variability, we estimated an effect of the precipitation decrease on the lake water budget as predicted by the regional climate scenarios for the next century.

J	Jurgelenaite, A; Kriauciuniene, J; Sarauskiene, D				Jurgelenaite, Aldona; Kriauciuniene, Jurate; Sarauskiene, Diana			Spatial and temporal variation in the water temperature of Lithuanian rivers	BALTICA												Water temperature is one of the twelve physico-chemical elements of water quality, used for the assessment of the ecological status of surface waters according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC. The thermal regime of Lithuanian rivers is not sufficiently studied. The presented article describes the temporal and spatial variation of water temperature in Lithuanian rivers. Since a huge amount of statistical data is available (time series from 141 water gauging stations), the average water temperatures of the warm season (May October) have been selected to analyse because that is the time when the most intensive hydrological and hydro biological processes in water bodies take place. Spatial distribution of river water temperature is mostly influenced by the type of river feeding, prevalence of sandy soils and lakes in a basin, river size, and orography of a river basin as well as anthropogenic activity. The temporal distribution of river water temperature is determined by climatic factors and local conditions. The averages of the warm season water temperature for 41 WGS are 15.1 degrees C in 1945-2010, 14.9 degrees C in 1961-1990, and 15.4 degrees C in 1991-2010. The most significant changes in water temperature trends are identified in the period of 1991-2010. For this period, the rates of increase of water and air temperature are 0.04 and 0.06 degrees C/warm season, respectively. Therefore, air temperature is one of the most significant factors affecting the water temperatures of Lithuanian rivers.

A multidisciplinary and multiscale approach allowed identification of this soil as a "masked" distal archive of volcanic products, developed on granite rocks and sediments with a coeval pyroclastic input during pedogenesis. The study demonstrates that the contribution of volcanic parent materials can be successfully hypothesized and assessed even in the absence, limited extent or poor preservation of primary eruptive products. The soil has an Andisol-like appearance, despite laboratory data that do not match the entire suite of diagnostic criteria for the Andisol taxonomic order. Geomorphological, stratigraphic and pedologic results, coupled with tephrostratigraphic and radiometric data, concur to suggest a Late Pleistocene(?) to Holocene age of the Andisol-like soil. In particular, the rhyolitic chemical composition of small-sized glass fragments (identified by SEM-EDS analyses) indicates soil genesis contributed by volcanic ash, probably sourced from Aeolian Arc explosive activity spanning the last 30 ka. Accordingly, the evidence of limited relict clay illuviation and the specific type of pedogenesis allowing the development of andic properties (in turn related to the neoformation of clay minerals from the weathering of volcanic glass) are consistent with a climatic shift from a seasonally-contrasted to a constantly humid pedoenvironment. This change can be ascribed to the Lateglacial(?) or Early-Middle Holocene to Late Holocene transition. Calibrated AMS C-14 dates performed on charcoal fragments sampled from three representative soil profiles, provide Late Holocene ages (3136+/-19, 343+/-16 and 92+/-24 yr BP), in accord with archaeological finds. On the basis of the consistent stratigraphic position, lateral continuity and wide extent, the soil can be considered a good pedostratigraphic marker in the Sila highlands and is informally defined as the "Cecita Lake geosol". It supplies valuable time constraints for the underlying (occasionally overlying) deposits and/or soils. Moreover, it allows regional-scale morphostratigraphic correlations and detailed reconstruction of Late Pleistocene-Holocene geomorphic events in Calabria, a very suitable region for distal tephra deposition in the central Mediterranean peri-volcanic area. The effects of high-energy volcanic eruptions are interfingered with or superimposed by other geomorphic processes and climatic or anthropogenic signals. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The hydrochemistry of a semi-arid pan basin case study: Sua Pan, Makgadikgadi, Botswana	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												This study presents results on the fluid and salt chemistry for the Makgadikgadi, a substantial continental basin in the semi-arid Kalahari. The aims of the study are to improve understanding of the hydrology of such a system and to identify the sources of the solutes and the controls on their cycling within pans. Sampling took place against the backdrop of unusually severe flooding as well as significant anthropogenic extraction of subsurface brines. This paper examines in particular the relationship between the chemistry of soil leachates, fresh stream water, salty lake water, surface salts and subsurface brines at Sua Pan, Botswana with the aim of improving the understanding of the system's hydrology. Occasionally during the short wet season (December-March) surface water enters the saline environment and precipitates mostly calcite and halite, as well as dolomite and traces of other salts associated with the desiccation of the lake. The hypersaline subsurface brine (up to TDS 190,000 mg/L) is homogenous with minor variations due to pumping by BotAsh mine (Botswana Ash (Pty) Ltd.), which extracts 2400 m(3) of brine/h from a depth of 38 m. Notable is the decrease in TDS as the pumping rate increases which may be indicative of subsurface recharge by less saline water. Isotope chemistry for Sr (Sr-87/Sr-86 average 0.722087) and S (delta S-34 average 34.35) suggests subsurface brines have been subject to a lithological contribution of undetermined origin. Recharge of the subsurface brine from surface water including the Nata River appears to be negligible. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Boreal Headwater Catchment as Hot Spot of Carbon Processing From Headwater to Fjord	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Boreal headwaters and aquatic sediments are significant transporters, stores and processors of terrestrial carbon (C) as well as emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs), mainly CO2 and CH4. While terrestrial ecosystems are net sinks of atmospheric C, lateral fluxes of total organic and dissolved inorganic C (TOC, DIC) as well as GHG release can significantly reduce the land C sink. However, the fate of the laterally exported C remains often unresolved. Here, we combine datasets from high-frequency sensors, monitoring and modeling to produce a C budget for a typical boreal lake and its catchment and examine it in a regional context. We show that lake TOC removal is dominated by microbial metabolism which shows strong seasonal fluctuations following stratification and ice-cover dynamics. We estimate that 11.5 g C m(-2) catchment yr(-1) are exported from the catchment soils and wetlands, including 9.5 g of TOC. Only 5.4 g C m(-2) catchment yr(-1) reach the coast while over 50% is reemitted to the atmosphere (5.7 g C m(-2) catchment yr(-1)). Part of the reemitted C originates from rapid turnover cycles and would not affect atmospheric CO2 and the land C sink. However, we show that the land C sink at Langtjern is reduced by >14% over the whole aquatic continuum, and by >10% within the headwater catchment. Our regional analysis suggests that headwater lake TOC mineralization is the main TOC loss along the aquatic continuum with burial being relatively small, and highlights the significance of small headwaters as intensive and fast-responding TOC processors.

In this study, multidisciplinary field studies including physical, chemical, and biological analyses were performed to demonstrate decadal and seasonal scale changes in the ecological environment in Yeongsan Reservoir (YSR), Korea, since the construction of a 4.35 km-long dam in 1981. The results of the study show that the volume of sediment accumulated in YSR was 75.2 million m(3) since the dam was constructed, resulting in a 33.6% reduction of the total water storage capacity. Also, water quality in YSR was affected by complex physico-chemical and hydrological phenomena, including saline and thermal stratifications, and pollutant loadings leading to eutrophication. Subsequent sediment bacteria analyses showed microbial diversity according to different depths in sediment, indicating the environmental change of sediment ecology. Moreover, the fish diversity in this study (2006-2007) was found to be considerably reduced compared to a similar study in 1989 (42% reduction), and the ecological health was deemed to be in a "poor" condition based on the 10-metric Lentic Ecosystem Health Assessment (LEHA) model. Accordingly, these results indicate that aquatic ecosystems are detrimentally affected by estuarine dams that block tidal flows, and when applied to short/long-term management strategies for artificial lakes in estuaries, suggest that similar construction projects have to be suitably controlled.

Zooplankton samples and specific environmental data were collected by a seasonal campaign (rainy season: June to August) and dry season: March to May 2023) from three sites: inlet area (IA), pelagic area (PA), and macrophyte area (MA). In total, 11 zooplankton taxa from four different groups - rotifera (7 taxa), cladocera (2 taxa), copepod (1 taxa), and ostracoda (1 taxa) - were identified in Lake Arekit. Large-bodied copepoda and cladocera comprised 90% of the zooplankton density in the lake, but small-bodied rotifers dominated the zooplankton diversity. The most noticeable zooplankton in the lake were Mesocyclops aequatorialis, Daphnia barbata, and Cypridopsis vidua. Seasonal difference in the total zooplankton abundance was evident (p < 0.01): being high during the rainy season which was accompanied by an increase in the lake's water temperature and nutrient levels. At MA, where D. barbata predominated, chlorophyll a was relatively low. Chlorophyll a had a strong negative correlation with the abundance of grazing zooplankton, especially with D. barbata (r = -0.563) and C. vidua (r = -0.518). The zooplankton composition and abundance of Lake Arekit reveal a low Shannon diversity index (H') (1.03) and a predominance of a few species, indicating heavy contamination of the lake's water. Moreover, Lake Arekit was determined to be hypertrophic (TSI > 70) using Carlson's trophic index (TSI), which took into account the lake's water transparency, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a. Our results indicated that high densities of Daphnia should be the goal of biomanipulation since they can achieve filtration potentials high enough to enhance the water's clarity in hypereutrophic lake. Even though high D. barbata concentrations cannot address the underlying cause of eutrophication, grazing can assist by lengthening the clear-water stages in a hypertrophic lake - Lake Arekit. The sources of pollution for the lake are the discharge of wastewater from nearby water bottling companies and possibly high nutrient levels from the lake's geological history. Stopping the discharge of wastewater from the nearby commercial industries (the major source of contaminant) into heavily washed open areas and establishing a buffer zone may help manage the water quality of Lake Arekit.

Season and presence of Gizzard Shad influence horizontal spatial distribution of zooplankton in reservoirs of the midwestern United States	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												We contrasted near- and offshore zooplankton biomass and assemblage structure in 15 reservoirs in the central United States. In particular, we evaluated whether season and the dominant pelagic planktivore, Gizzard Shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), influenced near- and offshore zooplankton dynamics in reservoirs. Independent of Gizzard Shad, nearshore areas had greater zooplankton biomass in all seasons than did offshore areas. This difference was consistent for all cladocerans, copepods, rotifers, and all other zooplankton combined (including Chaoborus, ostracods, Trombidiformes, and mussel veligers). Gizzard Shad presence drove the spatial dynamics of major taxonomic groups, and time of year also influenced the structure of zooplankton assemblages. Additionally, Gizzard Shad presence was correlated with more copepod and rotifer taxa than cladoceran taxa. The relative distribution of these taxa at near- and offshore sites, however, remained consistent whether or not Gizzard Shad were present. Gizzard Shad had the most pronounced effect on zooplankton assemblage structure in the middle of the growing season. Mean annual zooplankton biomass per unit volume was approximately 50% greater in nearshore areas than in offshore areas for reservoirs with and without Gizzard Shad. Our findings, therefore, show that dominant planktivores can alter the assemblage structure and distribution of zooplankton in reservoirs, as they do in natural lakes.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				MAR	2019	38	1					183	192		10.1086/701676	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/701676													WOS:000463819900015

Bio-economic studies on the catch of Bardawil Lagoon, North Sinai, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The paper aims to give a comprehensive descriptive survey on the production of Lake Bardawil from 1985 to 2015. The average production in this period was 2970 tons. Monthly samples were collected for 12 species of fish during fishing season 2015. The results showed that the Length at first capture (L-c) of different species in Bardawil Lagoon was less than the length at first maturity (L-m); L-m of Mugil cephalus, Sparus aurata and Dicentrarchus labrax was 31.1, 24.5 and 31.0 cm, meanwhile, L-c was 29.0, 18.5 and 27.8 cm respectively. The percentage of small fish with less than the Length at first maturity (L-m) constitutes 67.3% for inexpensive species and 77.05% for expensive species. The loss of biomass in the inexpensive species was estimated at 3268 tons and the loss in income was 199 million Egyptian pounds (LE). The loss of biomass of expensive species was calculated at 1455 tons and the loss of income was 175 million LE. The total loss of biomass was 4723 tons and 374 million LE due to fishing violations and the use of illegal nets in only one fishing season. For proper management, the Length at first capture (L-c) must be increased by widening the nets mesh size. Legal fishing methods and the development of appropriate non-traditional methods for the management of Bardawil Lagoon must be applied. (C) 2019 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

Effects on body mass, fat content and associated behaviors in American kestrels	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The current-use brominated flame retardant, 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (DBE-DBCH), is capable of perturbing sex steroid and thyroid hormone pathways in vitro and in vivo. Chemicals with this capability may also disrupt metabolic processes and are candidate obesogens, but this potential has not yet been determined for DBE-DBCH. Our objective was to examine gross biomarkers of metabolic disruption in captive American kestrels. Birds were exposed by diet to the 13 isomer at the environmentally relevant dose of 0.239 ng beta-DBE-DBCH/g kestrel/day, from 30 days (d) prior to pairing through until chicks hatched (82 d) (n = 30 breeding pairs) or for 28 d (n = 16 pre-breeding pairs), and were compared with vehicle-only exposed controls. Body mass was assessed throughout the breeding season at biologically relevant time points, flight and feeding behavior was measured in 5-min samples daily, and plasma triglycerides and cholesterol were assessed at d10 of brood rearing. Treated males were heavier than controls at pairing (p = 0.051), the final week of courtship (p = 0.061), and at d10 (p = 0.012) and d20 of brood rearing (p = 0.051); beta-DBE-DBCH-exposed breeding females were similar in weight to control females. Treated birds tended to have higher plasma triglycerides (p = 0.078), which for females, was positively associated with body mass (p = 0.019). Heavier breeding males had higher plasma concentrations of testosterone and total thyroxine (p <= 0.046). Overall, both sexes exposed to beta-DBE-DBCH demonstrated reduced flight behavior and increased feeding behavior during courtship. In the pre-breeding pairs, treated male and female kestrels had a higher percentage of body fat than respective controls (p = 0.045). These results demonstrate that beta-DBE-DBCH elicited inappropriate fat and weight gain in adult American kestrels, consistent with their increased feeding, reduced flight activity and endocrine changes, and suggests that DBE-DBCH may be an obesogen warranting further research to test this hypothesis.

Our reconstructed precipitation, lake water isotope ratio and evaporation-evapotranspiration isotope effect allows us to obtain an estimate of moisture balance, and, to a lesser extent, precipitation amount and seasonality changes. During the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, between ca 20 and 17.3 ka), high delta D values and smaller fractionation of leaf waxes indicate an and to semi-arid climate with a long lasting dry season. An abrupt change towards much wetter conditions occurred within ca 500 years from 17.3 to 16.8 ka, as shown by a 50 parts per thousand decrease in D/H ratios and a marked increase in H isotopic fractionation of leaf waxes. This abrupt isotopic change coincides with a major transformation from savanna-dominated vegetation to humid rain forest around the lake, based on pollen data. Comparisons with other paleo-precipitation records from South American sites indicate that Lateglacial humid conditions were controlled by intensification of the ITCZ and/or a southward shift of its mean position across our study site. Our isotope data show only a small rise in aridity during Younger Dryas event (13-11.5 ka). Although the Holocene was not screened in details, D/H ratios of terrestrial and aquatic compounds show near constant offsets, suggesting stable and relatively humid climate conditions during this period.

The geodynamic development mirrors gentle docking of the Carpathians into the European platform margin, associated with synrift and later postrift subsidence of the back-arc area. Onset of the basin inversion characterized the Pliocene evolution. The aquatic environments gradually changed from marine, brackish to caspibrackish and to freshwater within the "Lake Pannon" due to isolation, followed by development of ephemeral lakes and alluvial plains. The terrestrial record documents the extinction of the Middle Miocene fauna and the retreat of vegetation with subtropical floral elements at the beginning of the Late Miocene, due to changes in paleogeography and climate between 11.5 and 7.1 Ma. The immigration of a new "hipparion fauna", as well as the replacement of swamp vegetation by "coniferous forest" of the temperate zone can be interpreted as the first appearance of seasonality, with lowered humidity at the Pannonian/Pontian boundary. The Late Pontian to Early Pliocene fauna and flora, as well as sedimentary environments support the increase of humidity in warm temperate climate between 7.1 and 5.4 Ma. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The Northern Basin generally had a concentration of 5 mu g L-1 or less, except at station 1 (Nagahama Bay) from July to October during the study period. The maximum concentration at station 1 was 22.7, 35.9, and 22.0 mu g L-1 in October of 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. Eleven species of cyanobacteria were observed: Microcystis aeruginosa, M. ichthyoblabe, M. novacekii, M. wesenbergii, Oscillatoria raciborskii, Anabaena oumiana, A. affinis, A. flos-aquae, A. ucrainica, A. smithii, and A. crassa. Of these, M. aeruginosa and M. wesenbergii were the main components observed. A high concentration of microcystin in the lake water was mostly a result of variation in the relative amount of toxic M. aeruginosa rather than of the total Microcystis cell number. This was supported by the analytical results for isolated strains. Microcystis spp. cell density in the Northern Basin appeared to increase gradually over the course of the study. This is the first study to have surveyed the Northern Basin of Lake Biwa, which supplies drinking water to 14 million people and is the largest lake in Japan.

J	Hu, SS; Taylor, DW				Hu, Shusheng; Taylor, David Winship			Floristics and Paleoecology of an Early Cretaceous Flora from Jordan	BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY												Abundant plant fossils were recovered from Albian fluvial and back-swamp sediments of the Jarash Formation (Kurnub Group) of Jordan. The flora consists of angiosperms, ferns and gymnosperms. Water lily Scutifolium jordanicum, marsilealean fern Marsileaceaephyllum mahisensis and tree fern Weichselia reticulata are from a thin crevasse splay layer of a small fluvial system. Four species of other ferns, Phlebopteris hickeyi sp. nov., Piazopteris branneri, Aspidistes beckeri and Cladophlebis sp., and two gymnosperms, Zamites hoheneggeri and Brachyphyllum mamillare, are from a back-swamp dark gray carbonaceous lens. Phlebopteris hickeyi represents a new fern species that has five preserved pinnae with unique characteristics, including small sori and sporangia. The relatively small pinnules with massive midveins and grooves along either side of midveins represent a unique combination of characters. The water lily S. jordanicum and marsilealean fern M. mahisensis may have grown in ponds, lakes or slow-moving streams along the margin of the back-swamps. However, the tree fern W. reticulata is thought to have grown in tropical coastal areas. The co-occurrence of W. reticulata with S. jordanicum and M. mahisensis indicates that the habitat of water lily and marsilealean fern was not far from the coast. Additionally, M. mahisensis suggests the presence of dry seasons because extant Marsileaceae need a dry terrestrial phase for reproduction, which is consistent with climate implied from the xerophilic characters of W. reticulata. The matoniaceous fern Phlebopteris hickeyi, Piazopteris branneri, A. beckeri and bennettitalean Z. hoheneggeri were probably growing in the back-swamps. However, the conifer B. mamillare probably grew in coastal areas close to the back-swamps.

The bacterial community structure was analyzed in the 12 sites of upper Parana River floodplain, and its changes during a flood pulse were described. In order to understand how high and low water phases change bacterial community by changing abiotical variables, the bacterial community distribution was determined in superficial water of 12 different sampling stations, every 3 months, from December 2010 to September 2011. The bacterial community structure and diversity was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, considering the main domains Bacteria and Archaea and the subdivisions of the phylum Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria) and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster. Smaller densities were observed on ebb and low water periods and the highest density was observed in March 2011. The high water period caused a decrease in diversity because of the lost of equitability. The highest values of Shannon-Wiener index were found on December 2010 and September 2011. The nutrients runoff to the aquatic environments of the floodplain promoted an increase in the total bacterial density during the high water phase as well as changes in bacterial community composition. The bacterial community presented both spatial and temporal differences. Yet, temporal changes in limnological characteristics of the floodplain were the most important predictor of bacterial community and also influenced its diversity.

To elucidate the ecological succession in restored wetlands, the background characteristics and the effects of the restoration method on seed banks should be analyzed. On the basis of seedling emergence method, we examined the seed banks of typical plant communities in wetlands that were converted from farmlands from the mouth of the Xinxue River to the Nansi Lake in China. The effects of the restoration methods on the seed banks of the typical communities were analyzed over three seasons. Results show that 43 species exist in the germinable seed banks of the wetlands converted from farmlands in the Nansi Lake area. The average seed density is 2822 seed/m(2) (0-12,499 seed/m(2)), and some species have persistent seed banks. Species abundance and seed density vary among different communities. The Populus nigra community has the most abundant species in the seed bank, followed by the Phragmites australis, Potamogeton crispus, and Nelumbo nucifera communities. The restoration method, season, community type, and their interaction are found to exert varying effects on the characteristics of the seed bank. Findings suggest the presence of a particular quantity of seed reserves in the seed banks of the wetlands; i. e., certain species with persistent seed banks can be used to restore wetland vegetation. Restoration methods significantly influence different seed banks. The restoration mechanism might be attributed to the differences in seed resource and seed loss. The diverse strategies of propagation by various species and the emerging characteristics lead to the differences among the seed banks of different communities and the seed banks in different seasons. Thus, the effects of the restoration method on the soil seed banks in the restoration of wetland vegetation need further investigation. c 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Jha, PK; Minagawa, M				Jha, Pawan Kumar; Minagawa, Masao			Assessment of denitrification process in lower Ishikari river system, Japan	CHEMOSPHERE												Sediment denitrification rate and its role in removal of dissolved nitrate load in lower Ishikari river system were examined. Denitrification rate were measured using acetylene inhibition technique on the sediment samples collected during August 2009-July 2010. The denitrification rate varied from 0.001 to 1.9 mu g N g(-1) DM h(-1) with an average value of 0.21 mu g N g(-1) DM h(-1) in lower Ishikari river system. Denitrification rate showed positive correlation with dissolved nitrate concentration in the river basin, indicating overlying water column supplied nitrate for the sediment denitrification processes. Nutrient enrichment experiments result showed that denitrification rate increased significantly with addition of nitrate in case of samples collected from Barato Lake however no such increase was observed in the samples collected from Ishikari river main channel and its major tributaries indicating that factors other than substrate concentration such as population of denitrifier and hydrological properties of stream channel including channel depth and flow velocity may affects the denitrification rate in lower Ishikari river system. Denitrification rate showed no significant increase with the addition of labile carbon (glucose), indicating that sediment samples had sufficient organic matter to sustain denitrification activity. The result of nutrient spiraling model indicates that in-stream denitrification process removes on an average 5% d(-1) of dissolve nitrate load in Ishikari river. This study was carried out to fill the gap present in the availability of riverine denitrification rate measurement and its role in nitrogen budget from Japanese rivers characterize by small river length and high flow rate.

Effects of Water-Level Management on Nesting Success of Common Loons	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Water-level management is widespread and illustrates how contemporary climate can interact directly and indirectly with numerous biological and abiotic factors to influence reproductive success of wildlife species. We studied common loons, an iconic waterbird sensitive to timing and magnitude of water-level changes during the breeding season, using a before-after-control-impact design on large lakes in Voyageurs National Park (Minnesota, USA), to assess the effect of anthropogenic changes in hydroregime on their nesting success and productivity. We examined multiple competing a priori hypotheses in an information-theoretic framework, and predicted that magnitude of changes in loon productivity would be greater in the Namakan Reservoir, where water-level management was altered to mimic a more natural hydroregime, than in Rainy Lake, where management remained relatively unchanged. We determined outcomes from 278 nests during 2004-2006 by performing boat-based visits every 3-5 days, and measuring hydrologic, vegetative, and microtopographic covariates. Relative to comparably collected data for 260 total loon pairs during 1983-1986, productivity (chicks hatched/territorial pair) increased 95% in the Namakan Reservoir between the 2 time periods. Nest success declined in both lakes over the 2 study periods but less so in the Namakan Reservoir than in Rainy Lake. Flooding was a primary cause of nest failures (though second nests were less likely to flood). Nest predation appears to have increased considerably between the 2 study periods. Top-ranked models suggested that timing of nest initiation, probability of nest flooding, probability of nest stranding, and probability of nest success were each related to 2-4 factors, including date of initiation, timing of initiation relative to peak water levels, changes in the elevation of the nest edge, maximum water-level change between initiation and peak water levels, and maximum water-level change between initiation and nest outcome. The top model for all variables except stranding each garnered 82% of total model weight. Results demonstrate that water-level management can be altered to benefit productivity of common loons. However, nuanced interactions between land-use change, invasive species, human development, recreation, climate change, and recovery of top predators may often complicate both management decisions and interpretation of water-level impacts on wildlife.

J	Peverell, SC				Peverell, SC			Distribution of sawfishes (Pristidae) in the Queensland Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, with notes on sawfish ecology	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Pristis microdon, P. zijsron, P. clavata and Anoxypristis cuspidata are distributed throughout the Queensland section of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. In a survey of the four species, Anoxypristis cuspidata was the most abundant and was recorded in both the inshore and offshore set net fisheries. The size distribution and catch locations of A. cuspidata suggest that the inshore area to a depth of 10 m may be the preferred habitat for juveniles of this species, while adults primarily occur offshore. Pristis microdon, P. zijsron and P. clavata were recorded only in the inshore fishery with catches dominated by immature animals. Pristis microdon was caught in the inshore fishery late in the monsoonal wet season (February to April) and inhabited both freshwater and estuarine environments. Pristis zijsron occurred only on the sand and mud flats outside river mouths whilst P. clavata inhabited both the sand and mud flats and upstream estuarine habitats. Observations on reproductive staging and the capture of neonate specimens suggest that in all four pristids, pupping occurred through the wet season until the beginning of the dry season in May. A seasonal set net closure for the barramundi, Lates calcarifer and shark fisheries, which has been in place since 1980 in Queensland Gulf waters, therefore offers a measure of protection to breeding female sawfish and their offspring.																			0378-1909					AUG	2005	73	4					391	402		10.1007/s10641-005-1599-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-005-1599-8													WOS:000230516200005

A 2-year (2002-2003) survey of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments is reported for two off-shore stations of Lake Tanganyika, Kigoma (Tanzania) and Mpulungu (Zambia), and from three cruises between those sites. Chlorophyll a concentrations were low (0.3-3.4 mg m(-3)) and average chlorophyll a integrated through the 100 m water column were similar for both stations and years (36.4-41.3 mg m(-2)). Most pigments were located in the 0-60 m layer and decreased sharply downward. Chlorophyll a degradation products (phaeophytins and phaeophorbides) were detected at 100 m depth, whereas carotenoids became undetectable. Temporal and seasonal variation of the vertical distribution of pigments was high. 2. The biomass of phytoplankton groups was calculated from marker pigment concentrations over the 0-100 m water column using the CHEMTAX software. On average for the study period, chlorophytes dominated in the northern station, followed by cyanobacteria T1 (type 1, or Synechococcus pigment type), whereas cyanobacteria T1 dominated in the south. Cyanobacteria T2 (type 2, containing echinenone), presumably corresponding to filamentous taxa, were detected in the rainy season. Diatoms (and chrysophytes) developed better in the dry season conditions, with a deep mixed layer and increased nutrient availability. Very large variation in the vertical distribution of algal groups was observed. 3. Our observations on phytoplankton composition are broadly consistent with those from previous studies. Our pigment data provide evidence for the lake-wide importance of picocyanobacteria and high interannual variation and spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton in Lake Tanganyika, which may render difficult assessment of long-term changes in phytoplankton driven by climate change.					; Stenuite, Stephane/B-7787-2008; Kimirei, Ismael/F-7385-2012	Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Kimirei, Ismael/0000-0002-1101-5262													0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2005	50	4					668	684		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01358.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01358.x													WOS:000227648100011

Spatial and temporal structure of the trematode component community in Valvata macrostoma (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia)	PARASITOLOGY												We conducted the first comprehensive study on the spatiotemporal structure of trematode communities in the large-mouthed valve snail, Valvata macrostoma. A total of 1103 snails were examined monthly between May and October 2007 from Lake Konnevesi, Central Finland, from a shallow (1-2 m deep) and an offshore site (5-6 m deep), located ca. 50-70 m apart. Snails were infected by 10 trematode species. The species composition and prevalence were strikingly different between the sites with high species diversity in the shallow site (all 10 species; total prevalence of sporocysts/rediae 12.1%, metacercariae 55.4%) compared to the deeper site (3 species; prevalence 15.0% and 1.9%, respectively). This difference persisted throughout Our Study and is probably related to the spatial distribution of bird definitive hosts, whereas the seasonal parasite dynamics are likely to be affected by changes in the age-structure of the snail population. The probability of sporocyst infections increased with snail size, but no such trend was observed in redial or metacercarial infections which decreased with host size. Our results show that generally well-described spatiotemporal differences in trematode infection of molluscs can emerge in very narrow spatial and temporal scales, which emphasizes the importance of these factors in community studies.					; Faltynkova, Anna/L-9321-2014	Faltynkova, Anna/0000-0003-3013-5881; Karvonen, Anssi/0000-0002-2731-3344; 													0031-1820					DEC	2008	135	14					1691	1699		10.1017/S0031182008005027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182008005027								18992180					WOS:000262075100009

The coupling of N/P: DIN (DIN = NO2- + NO3- + NH4+) to DIP (DIP = PO43-) with P/C: protein/carbohydrates ratios along salinity gradient allowed the discrimination of three types of ecosystems. Pond A1 (mean salinity: 45.0 +/- 5.4) having marine characteristics showed enhanced P/C ratios during a diatom bloom. N/P and P/C ratios were closely coupled throughout the sampling period, Suggesting that the nutritional status is important in determining the seasonal change in the phytoplankton community in pond A1. In pond A16 (mean salinity: 78.7 +/- 8.8), despite the high nitrate load, P/C ratios were overall lower than in pond A1. This may be explained by the fact that dinoflagellates, which were the most abundant phytoplankton in pond A16 might be strict heterotrophs and/or mixotrophs, and so they may have not contributed strongly to anabolic processes. Also, N/P and P/C ratios were uncoupled, Suggesting that cells in pond A16 were stressed due to the increased salinity caused by water evaporation, and so cells synthesized reserve products such as carbohydrates. In pond M2 (mean salinity: 189.0 +/- 13.8), P/C levels were higher than those recorded in either pond A1 or A16. N/P and P/C were more coupled than in pond A16. Species in the hypersaline pond seemed paradoxally less stressed than in pond A16, suggesting that salt-tolerant extremophile species overcome hypersaline constraints and react metabolically by synthesizing carbohydrates and proteins.

Among known algal toxins, microcystin (MC) is the most harmful and most commonly detected. Because of its stable chemical structure, it is difficult to degrade MC though chemical and physical methods. Hence, effectively removing MC from water and ensuring water safety have become urgent issues. In this study, strain DMC-X3, which could rapidly and efficiently degrade MC, was isolated from a reservoir affected by a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom and identified as Stenotrophomonas geniculate. Inoculated at OD600 = 0.1, strain DMC-X3 degraded 70 % of 1000 mu g/L MC in 24 h, and over 90 % within 48 h. When the inoculation density was increased to OD600 = 0.35, this bacterial strain completely degraded 1000 mu g/L MC in 16 h and 5000 mu g/L MC in 96 h. DMC-X3 maintained its MC degradation ability under the environmental conditions of pH 5-11 and 15-35 degrees C. After 60 d of storage at room temperature, DMC-X3 embedded and immobilized on sodium alginate pellets showed 90 % degradation of 200 mu g/L MC in 48 h, and the pellets could be used for at least three cycles. Sustained-release pellets made by embedding and immobilizing both the degradation bacteria DMC-X3 and algicidal substance prodigiosin on sodium alginate effectively eradicated M. aeruginosa cells and degraded MC, promising a good application prospect in controlling M. aeruginosa blooms.

Mechanical stress is known to damage charophyte communities, however, virtually nothing is known how such disturbance affect seasonal succession and recovery of charophyte communities. We examined the response of a shallow water charophyte community to different types and timing of disturbances by conducting seasonal in situ field experiment in a brackish water ecosystem. The disturbances associated with mechanical removal of vegetation or sediment had the largest impact on the charophyte community. Disturbances that only partly damaged the plants had minor effects and communities were characterized by fast recovery. The timing of disturbance had significant effects on the charophyte community with Stronger effects when disturbed at the early stage compared to mid-stage of seasonal succession.

Compared with traditionally deployed water surface parameters, changes in the water-boundary more effectively account for the dynamics of water surface and depth resulting from hydrological variations. However, previous studies of hydrological connectivity generally applied only connectivity length or width parameters using the center line of the water body and therefore fail to fully capture the impact of water boundary dynamics. In this study, optimized water body extraction indices based on data obtained from remote sensing imagery are used to develop a novel metric that indicates water surface boundary dynamics and reveal surface hydrological connectivity changes in the Yangtze River Delta from 1990 to 2020. Detailed inter-annual and seasonal changes in the evolution of water body boundaries from a water surface perspective indicate an overall decline in hydrological connectivity against the background of climate change, increased urbanization, and dam construction. The declining trend in connectivity occurs in three phases, viz. from 1990 to 2003, a gradual decline is exhibited but with a very marked degree of inter-seasonal variability; between 2003 and 2012, connectivity remains relatively constant but with a reduced amplitude between seasons; further reductions in the magnitude of seasonal variations characterize the third phase, to 2020. Meanwhile, the stability of hydrological connectivity, indicated by the coefficient of variation, also exhibits marked spatial heterogeneity. Parts of the delta with more tributaries, including the Huaihe and southeastern basins, have lower stability (7.33 and 6.59, respectively) than the Yangtze basin (6.22). This study presents a novel metric to achieve greater precision in the monitoring of hydrological connectivity. Such information can be harnessed to improve regional ecological and water resource management.					; Su, Jie/JEZ-4685-2023; liu, wenjun/L-5256-2016; Kong, Fanhua/LIG-5996-2024; Zhou, Kejing/NLN-8550-2025; Meadows, Michael/AAH-2461-2020	Su, Jie/0000-0002-6830-9691; KONG, Fanhua/0000-0002-4031-0519; Li, Zhenya/0000-0003-2247-7726; Meadows, Michael/0000-0001-8322-3055													0309-1333	1477-0296				FEB	2024	48	1					96	112		10.1177/03091333231213536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03091333231213536		NOV 2023											WOS:001102253200001

However, water quality sampling frequencies are rarely adjusted to the actual variation of the monitoring area. Manual sampling, for example, is often limited by the level of funding and not by the optimal timing to take samples. Restrictions in monitoring methods therefore often determine their ability to estimate the true mean and variance values for a certain time period or season. Consequently, we estimated how different sampling intervals determine the mean and standard deviation in a specific monitoring area by using high frequency data from in situ automated monitoring stations. Raw fluorescence measurements of chlorophyll a for three automated monitoring stations were calibrated by using phycocyanin fluorescence measurements and chlorophyll a analyzed from manual water samples in a laboratory. A moving block bootstrap simulation was then used to estimate the standard errors of the mean and standard deviations for different sample sizes. Our results showed that in a temperate, meso-eutrophic lake, relatively high errors in seasonal statistics can be expected from monthly sampling. Moreover, weekly sampling yielded relatively small accuracy benefits compared to a fortnightly sampling. The presented method for temporal representation analysis can be used as a tool in sampling design by adjusting the sampling interval to suit the actual temporal variation in the monitoring area, in addition to being used for estimating the usefulness of previously collected data.					; Kuoppamaki, Kirsi/E-8699-2015	Anttila, Saku/0000-0001-7013-9575; Kuoppamaki, Kirsi/0000-0002-6703-4024													1464-0325	1464-0333				FEB	2012	14	2					589	595		10.1039/c2em10768f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em10768f								22159426					WOS:000299794900031

Water flow measurements indicate that 20.6-68.9% of drainage water captured by OFTs was reused for supplemental irrigation. Rainfall was the most important factor that determines the water reuse efficiency (WRR) of OFTs, since higher rainfall resulted in higher surplus irrigation water draining out of OFTs without reuse, and thus decreased WRR. Fully using the storage capacity for storing return flow, and releasing totally for supplemental irrigation also enhanced WRR of OFTs. Water quality analysis shows that OFTs removed 47.2% of total phosphorous (TP) and 60.8% of total nitrogen (TN) of inflow and have a great effect on increasing sedimentation for return flow as the mean of removal efficiency of pollutant load (REL) for suspended solids (SS) amounted to 68.4%. For water treatment effectiveness of OM, high hydraulic retention time (HRT) is most beneficial to increase REL of TN whereas REL of TP is not sensitive to HRT. These results confirm that OFTs can effectively increase agricultural return flow reuse and remove pollutants. As the cascade OFTs irrigation system recycle return flow for several times, the irrigation water demand from outside of region was reduced significantly for rice production. Coupling with the effect of cyclic irrigation on the nutrients recycling by paddy fields, OFTs irrigation system also considerably mitigate the N and P off-site emission. Therefore, it is advisable to integrate the role of OFTs on water reuse and treatment for water saving irrigation and ecological management of paddy fields landscape. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

For this proposal, in vivo genotoxicity tests (Comet and micronucleus assay) were performed in an experimental pilot plant set up near Lake Trasimeno (Central Italy). The effects were detected in different tissues (haemocytes for the Comet assay and gills for the micronucleus test [MN]) of Dreissena polymorpha exposed in experimental basins supplied with lake water with/without the different disinfectants. Specimen collection was performed before disinfectant input for both tests and after the start of disinfection (3 h and 20 days for the Comet assay and 10 and 20 days for micronucleus test, respectively) to assess short- and long- term exposure effects during three sampling campaigns (October 2000, February 2001, and June 2001). Seasonal differences in baseline levels of DNA migration and micronucleus frequency were observed. Raw water quality modulation on disinfection by-product formation was shown. The results of the micronucleus and Comet assays on zebra mussel cells after in situ exposure to water disinfected with the two chlorinated compounds clearly indicate DNA/by-product interaction. PAA did not induce either clastogenic/aneugenic effects or DNA damage on this bioindicator. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Its size exceeded that of any Permian-Carboniferous lake in the European basins of that period so far described. Continual sedimentation of organic-rich, seasonally laminated clayey-silty lake deposits produced a unique high-resolution record of part of the Stephanian B climate in the studied region. An extraordinarily large trophic web of fish assemblages also proves the temporal stability of this meromictic oligotrophic take. The lake hydrology was inferred from the chemical and isotopic analyses of the autochthonous carbonates, particularly siderite, and analysis of organic matter. The environmental and weathering conditions in the lake watershed were inferred from analysis of palynospectra and detrital clay minerals. The lake passed through several stages of development including an initial highstand with peak productivity, a stepwise increase in mineralization accompanying gradual lake regression, a lowstand in the middle part of its lifetime, a partial lake recovery, and then a final transition to a shallow lacustrine-deltaic system. Lake regression was triggered by a long-term decrease in the P/E ratio coupled with increasing seasonality and accompanied by a decrease in intensity of chemical weathering in the drainage basin. Considerable vegetation response to fluctuating lake levels suggests complex environmental changes. During the initial lake highstand, abundant and diversified assemblages of xerophilous elements prevailed, spores of ferns prevailed during the regressive episode, and spores of lycopsids abruptly increased at the lowstand and remained dominant in the palynospectra of the second lake highstand. Final transition to a lacustrine-deltaic system was associated with pronounced increase in sphenopsids and ferns. These changes can be attributed to Milankovitch-like climate change from warm-wet to warm-seasonal dry, and may be inferred to have been responsible for Stephanian continental cyclothems. The entire Stephanian B period was more humid than the preceding Barruelian and subsequent Stephanian C in the Czech basins, thus revealing a climate cycle at a timescale of several million years, which is discussed in relation to southern Gondwana ice sheet stability.

Larval lake sturgeon production and drift behaviour in the Menominee and Oconto Rivers, Wisconsin	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have been negatively impacted by barriers to migration, pollution and overharvest. Biological data such as the timing of spawning activity and larval drift have provided a better understanding of larval production success or failure on a site-specific basis. However, many river systems that serve as reproductive locations for remnant lake sturgeon populations remain understudied. The objective of this study was to compare and contrast aspects of larval lake sturgeon drift within and between the Oconto and Menominee Rivers over multiple reproductive seasons. Differences in larval drift chronology, the size of drifting larvae during the season and the cross-sectional profile of drifting individuals as a function of river velocity were evaluated. D-frame drift nets were deployed at a single transect below spawning sites in the Menominee (2012, 2013 and 2014) and Oconto Rivers (2013, 2014 and 2015). A total of 4,442 larvae were captured across all seasons. Larvae exhibited nonrandom drift profiles related to water velocity, and larvae size was related to horizontal drift location. The seasonal increase in body size of drifting larvae also differed among drift events within and between years and across rivers. This information will provide a better understanding of lake sturgeon early life history and has practical management connections including spawning site protection/enhancement and river flow mitigation.

We collected groundwater, river water, and wetland water from the Caohai catchment to investigate the isotope composition of DIC and inorganic carbon cycling. The main sources of groundwater DIC were carbonate dissolution and soil CO2. Groundwater was the main source of riverine DIC, but the delta C-13(DIC) value in river water showed a more positive excursion than groundwater because of phytoplankton photosynthesis and CO2 evasion. Seasonal variations in DIC concentrations and the delta C-13(DIC) indicate the influence of local rainfall events in the high-flow season and the longer residence time of water in the low-flow season. There was marked seasonal variation in the pCO(2) and delta C-13(DIC) in wetland water. During the high-flow season, the pCO(2) in the emergent plant zone was higher than that of the atmosphere because of respiration of roots and sediments. Because of photosynthesis, the pCO(2) in the submerged plant zone was lower than that of the atmosphere. Furthermore, in this zone, the delta C-13(DIC) ranged from -15.13 to -6.68 % (mean value of -10.79 %), and may have been influenced by chemically enhanced fractionation and photosynthesis. In the low-flow season, the pCO(2) was mostly higher than atmospheric pCO(2) because of organic matter decomposition in sediments. Additionally, during this season, the delta C-13(DIC) ranged from -6.23 to -0.06 % (mean value of -2.52 %), and may have been influenced by CO2 evasion, CO2 reduction to methane, and phytoplankton photosynthesis.

We followed the seasonal dynamics of the food web in two natural fishponds for two years: one was stocked with planktivorous whitefish while the other had no planktivorous fish. The aim of the study was the simultaneous assessment of the feeding behaviours of planktivorous fish and of bacterivorous meta-/protozooplankters. We hypothesized that in the presence of planktivorous fish there would be fewer metazooplankton, more protozoans and decreased numbers of bacteria. Our results showed that the amount of metazooplankton eaten by the fish was indeed negatively correlated with metazooplankton biomass. The feeding impact of planktivorous fish in shaping the microbial loop was remarkable. The main grazers of bacteria in the fishpond were ciliates, whereas in the pond without fish these were heterotrophic nanoflagellates. In the fishless pond the role of the top predator shifted to the predaceous metazooplankter Leptodora kindtii which controlled the abundance of herbivorous metazooplankters. We found a negative relationship between the number of bacteria and flagellates in the fishless pond, while the number of bacterivorous ciliates was suppressed by predaceous ciliates. Therefore the bacteria-grazing activity was higher in the absence of planktivorous fish. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Properties of phosphorus retention in sediments under different hydrological regimes: A laboratory-scale simulation study	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Excessive nutrient loading and changing hydrological regimes can significantly impact the ecological function of wetland ecosystems. Three wetland sediment samples collected from West Lake, Xiazhuhu Wetland and Baoyang River in the Taihu Lake Watershed, China, were compared to understand the P retention properties responding to hydrological regimes by using static column and steady-flow flume laboratory-scale experiments. Sediment in Xiazhuhu Wetland currently function as a P sink with equilibrium P concentration (EPC0) values of 0.010 mg L-1, while sediments from West Lake and Baoyang River, have EPC0 values of 0.050 mg L-1 and 0.023 mg L-1, respectively, and serve as an internal P source. The P retention by sediments ranged from 17.20 to 22.61 mg m(-2) d(-1) under 35-d static conditions, while sediment beds continuously fed by the simulated inflow water containing 2 mg L-1 P ranged from 59.20 to 171.93 mg m(-2) d(-1). The P removal capacities by sediments were higher during the rainy season than the dry season when wetlands were subjected to excessive P input. Since the majority of external P stored in sediment is in the form of Al-P (e.g., for Xiazhuhu wetland), the application of alum to water column could potentially increase the P retention capacity of sediment.

Lake Erie, one of the five North American Great Lakes is classified as highly stressed and deteriorating with significant flooding and erosion issues stemming from record-high water levels. This study adapts a well-established oceanic coastal vulnerability index to estimate impacts and risks of lake-level rise on the Ohio portion of Lake Erie coastal social-ecological system. The authors worked closely with coastal engineers, planners, and other practitioners associated with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) and the Office of Coastal Management (OCM) to help adapt a scientifically-grounded framework for natural resource and policy decision making. Overall, place-based risk and vulnerability to flooding and erosion necessitates an integrated approach that combines socio-economic, built-environment, political boundaries, and bio-physical characteristics. While most of the integrated methodologies are focused on the oceanic coasts at the county scale, this research presents a model for Lake Erie-relevant variables at the higher-resolution census-tract unit of analysis and a coastal vulnerability index at 100-foot intervals along the coastline for four decades and each season. The result is both a foundation for Ohio's Department of Natural Resources, Office of Coastal Management to identify scientifically-informed, place-based priority management areas for flooding and erosion, as well as a methodological roadmap to adapt the Coastal and Place Vulnerability Indices to the other Great Lakes' states and provincial shorelines.					; Kramar, David/HJA-2944-2022	Siman, Kelly/0000-0003-2482-1287; Kramar, David/0000-0003-4748-1908													0892-0753	1521-0421				JAN 21	2022	50	1					45	61		10.1080/08920753.2022.2006881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08920753.2022.2006881		NOV 2021											WOS:000724685700001

ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (delta N-15) have been used to estimate trophic position (TP) of organisms due to the predictable enrichment of nitrogen-15 in consumer tissues relative to their diet. We explored estimates of trophic position using liver and muscle delta N-15 and stomach content analysis in a broad size range of Arapaima sp. from Amazonian floodplain lakes. Estimates of TP based on liver delta N-15 were more closely related to the stomach content data than estimates based on muscle delta N-15, possibly because of the higher turnover of nitrogen in liver. Total length and season explained most of the variation in TP values estimated from delta N-15, showing that they have more effect than prey trophic position on delta N-15 values. The TP estimated by identification of stomach content was 3.6 and was unrelated to the size of the arapaima. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the factors that affect values of delta N-15 and stomach content analysis is still needed to unravel the trophic ecology of predatory fishes.					; Villamarín, Francisco/D-8765-2013; Magnusson, William/J-9408-2014; Jardine, Timothy/AFZ-4837-2022; Jacobi, Cristina/AGX-0389-2022	Jacobi, Cristina Mariana/0000-0001-5660-7934; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2020	29	4					779	789		10.1111/eff.12553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12553		MAY 2020											WOS:000530889100001

A total of 2880 E. coli isolates obtained from surface water and sediment samples from the Yeongsan River in 2013 were genotyped by using the horizontal fluorophore-enhanced rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting technique. Although different E. coli genotypic groups were observed between surface water and sediments in the dry season, they were mingled and undifferentiated from each other in the rainy season. This indicates that there are frequent sediment resuspension events in the river basin. Moreover, the genotypic composition of the E. coli population in the Yeongsan River basin changes over months and years, implying that genotypic structure of E. coli populations dynamically fluctuates in the river environment. Consequently, our data suggests that the use of E. coli libraries for fecal source tracking needs to be reassessed to account for the changing structure of riverine E. coli populations.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1.Aquatic invasive species can have a variety of negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in the muscle tissue of aquatic organisms have proved useful for evaluating post-invasion dietary shifts among species. However, oxygen and carbon stable isotopes in fish otoliths have the potential to provide additional data on thermal habitat, diet and metabolism, when investigating interactions among sympatric native and invasive fishes. 2.We conducted oxygen and carbon stable isotope analysis on the otoliths of three morphotypes of native whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and invasive vendace (Coregonus albula) at two sites within the sub-Arctic Pasvik watercourse in northern Norway. 3.Mean temperature use among morphotypes and species over the course of the growing season ranged from 7.5 degrees C to 11.2 degrees C. Otolith C-13 was significantly positively correlated to fish muscle tissue C-13 (P<0.05, r(2)=0.53). Significant differences in temperature use and C-13 among morphotypes and between species were found in the downstream site but not the upstream site. 4.Complementary partitioning of thermal and dietary resource use in the downstream site coincides with a higher abundance of whitefish, enabling the coexistence of both species. In contrast, vendace were dominant in the upstream site where no differentiation in resource use among morphotypes and between species was evident. 5.This study demonstrates the usefulness of stable oxygen and carbon otolith isotopes for characterising resource use and highlights the importance of investigating thermal habitat use as a factor influencing the success of invasive fishes.

The first national endosulfan usage inventories in China with 1/4A degrees longitude by 1/6A degrees latitude resolution has been reported in an accompanying paper. In the second part of the paper, we compiled the gridded historical emissions and soil residues of endosulfan in China from the usage inventories. Based on the residue/emission data, gridded concentrations of endosulfan in Chinese soil and air have been calculated. These inventories will provide valuable data for the further study of endosulfan. Emission and residue of endosulfan were calculated from endosulfan usage by using a simplified gridded pesticide emission and residue model-SGPERM, which is an integrated modeling system combining mathematical model, database management system, and geographic information system. By using the emission and residue inventories, annual air and soil concentrations of endosulfan in each cell were determined. Historical gridded emission and residue inventories of alpha- and beta-endosulfan in agricultural soil in China with 1/4A degrees longitude by 1/6A degrees latitude resolution have been created. Total emissions were around 10,800 t, with alpha-endosulfan at 7,400 t and beta-endosulfan at 3,400 t from 1994 to 2004. The highest residues were 140 t for alpha-endosulfan and 390 t for beta-endosulfan, and the lowest residues were 0.7 t for alpha-endosulfan and 170 t for beta-endosulfan in 2004 in Chinese agricultural soil where endosulfan was applied. Based on the emission and residue inventories, concentrations of alpha- and beta-endosulfan in Chinese air and agricultural surface soil were also calculated for each grid cell. We have estimated annual averaged air concentrations and the annual minimum and maximum soil concentrations across China. The real concentrations will be different from season to season. Although our model does not consider the transport of the insecticide in the atmosphere, which could be very important in some areas during some special time, the estimated concentrations of endosulfan in Chinese air and soil derived from the endosulfan emission and residue inventories are in general consistent with the published monitoring data. To our knowledge, this work is the first inventory of this kind for endosulfan published on a national scale. Concentrations of the chemical in Chinese air and agricultural surface soil were calculated for each grid cell. Results show that the estimated concentrations of endosulfan in Chinese air and soil agree reasonably well with the monitoring data in general. The gridded endosulfan emission/residue inventories and also the air and soil concentration inventories created in this study will be updated upon availability of new information, including usage and monitoring data. The establishment of these inventories for the OCP is important for both scientific communities and policy makers.

Methane (CH4) emission from its rice fields has been widely measured since the late 1980s. This study collected the results of available field research, totaling 204 season-treatment measurements conducted on 23 sites. Analysis of these data shows that input of organic material, such as green manure, animal waste, and crop straw, increases CH4 emission by a factor of 2. Average CH4 flux from intermittently irrigated rice fields is 53% of that from continuously flooded rice fields; and average CH4 emission flux from late rice fields is 1.6 and 2.3 times greater than flux from early and single rice fields, respectively. There are regional differences in emission factors and a trend of decreasing emission from south to north. On the basis of earlier estimates of CH4 emission from Chinese rice fields, and recent reports on the use of crop residue and green manure, it is presumed that half of the rice fields in China receive organic input. From the frequency of various water management events indicated in the surveyed field experiments, as well as from specific statements in individual reports, it is presumed that 2/3 of irrigated rice fields have been intermittently flooded. On the basis of these assumptions, the region-specific emission factors, and 1995 data on rice cultivation area, CH4 emission from growing-season rice fields in Mainland China was estimated to be 7.67 Tg yr(-1), ranging from 5.82 to 9.57 Tg yr(-1), due to uncertainties in the areas receiving organic inputs, and intermittent irrigation. Generalized seasonal flux patterns were developed for early, late, and single rice. Monthly distributions of emission were estimated from these patterns and rice calendars. The highest emission rate occurred in August. Spatially, emission hot spots included the plains of Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, Boyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, the delta region of Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province, and the Sichuan Basin. Nearly 90% of all Mainland China CH4 emission occurred between 23degreesN and 33degreesN.

Response of Eurasian and Hybrid Watermilfoil to Low Use Rates and Extended Exposures of 2,4-D and Triclopyr	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) and hybrid watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum x M. sibiricum) are invasive submersed plants that coexist in the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest regions. The auxin-mimic herbicides triclopyr (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyloxyacetic acid) and 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid) are commonly used to control these species at recommended use rates of 1.5 to 2.5 mg L-1 and 2.0 to 4.0 mg L-1, respectively. Recent field data suggest that following some early season applications, control of watermilfoil may be related to extended exposures to low concentrations of these herbicides. Two greenhouse studies were conducted to determine the efficacy of lower concentrations and extended exposures of 2,4-D and triclopyr on both Eurasian and hybrid watermilfoil. Concentrations evaluated included 0, 25, 70, 100 and 250 mu g L-1 2,4-D amine or triclopyr. At 7 weeks after treatment, Eurasian watermilfoil biomass was significantly reduced with all rates of 2,4-D and triclopyr in both studies. Triclopyr at rates of 70 to 250 mu g L-1 controlled hybrid watermilfoil by 88 to 100% in study 1, while all rates of triclopyr resulted in 100% control of hybrid watermilfoil in study 2. The 2,4-D treatments of 25 to 100 mu g L were not different from the untreated control, whereas the 250 mu g L-1 treatment resulted in a 95% biomass reduction for hybrid milfoil in study 1. In study 2, 2,4-D at 70 mu g L-1 and higher controlled hybrid watermilfoil by 93 to 100%. Results from these studies indicate that low rates and extended exposures of both triclopyr and 2,4-D can be effective at controlling both Eurasian and hybrid watermilfoil; however, different hybrid watermilfoil accessions may respond differently to low concentrations of the auxin-mimic herbicides. The ability to utilize low concentrations of these compounds in areas with limited water exchange may represent a cost-effective, selective, and large-scale treatment strategy not fully utilized today.

Historic and recent trends of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and environmental conditions in Clear Lake, California: A 70-year perspective	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												Clear Lake is a large, natural lake in northern California, USA, with many beneficial uses but also substantive environmental issues. The lake has a long history of water quality problems including mercury contamination, pesticide usage, invasive species, and high rates of primary production. In recent years, an increase in cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) has been documented in the lake, adding to the environmental issues faced by aquatic species present in the lake and the local community. Extensive observations of various physical, chemical, and biological parameters in Clear Lake began in the mid-1900s. The most pertinent of these data sets and findings have been reviewed and analyzed with the intent of improving our understanding of the causes and drivers of cyanoHABs, toxin production, and identifying data gaps. Several parameters including average annual water temperature have remained relatively constant over the past 70 years, although the seasonally averaged water temperatures have shifted in a manner that may now favor cyanobacterial dominance. Clear Lake has also witnessed recent changes in several environmental variables such as total phosphorus concentrations that might contribute to blooms. An analysis of lake conditions prior to and following the enactment of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for phosphorus in 2007 indicates little measurable influence on total phosphorus concentrations in Clear Lake. The present trajectory of lake chemistry suggests that additional research and management efforts will be needed to address the recurrence of cyanoHABs in the future. Future lake management strategies should include consideration of the role of internal nutrient loads to lessen cyanoHABs. Furthermore, a better understanding of cyanobacterial community interactions and top-down effects on bloom formation within the lake can help guide future cyanoHAB management strategies.					; Beck, Marcus/AAM-9972-2021; Ryan, Sara/AAD-9568-2019	Huie, Stephen/0009-0008-1363-2812; Beck, Marcus/0000-0002-4996-0059; Smith, Jayme/0000-0002-9669-4427; 													2325-1026					NOV 3	2023	11	1							00115	10.1525/elementa.2022.00115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2022.00115													WOS:001104777800001

Q03008	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												We determined hydrogen isotope ratios of individual fatty acids in a sediment core from Blood Pond, Massachusetts, USA, in order to reconstruct climate changes during the past 15 kyr. In addition to palmitic acid (C-16 n-acid), which has been shown to record lake water D/H ratios, our surface sediments and down core data indicate that behenic acid (C-22 n-acid), produced mainly by aquatic macrophytes, is also effective for capturing past environmental change. Calibration using surface sediments from two transects across eastern North America indicates that behenic acid records delta D variation of lake water. Down core variations in delta D values of behenic acid and pollen taxa are consistent with the known climate change history of New England. By evaluating the hypothesis that D/H fractionations of long chain even numbered fatty acids (C-24-C-32 n-acids) relative to lake water provide independent estimates of relative humidity during the growing season, we find that differences between lake-level records and isotopically inferred humidity estimates may provide useful insight into seasonal aspects of the hydrologic cycle. Combined analyses of D/H of short and long chain fatty acids from lake sediment cores thus allow reconstructions of both past temperature and growing season relative humidity. Comparison of delta D records from two lakes in New England provides critical information on regional climate variation and abrupt climate change, such as the 8.2 ka event.					; Huang, Yanhong/GVU-8674-2022; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018	Shuman, Bryan/0000-0002-8149-8925; Hou, Juzhi/0000-0002-8512-5739														1525-2027				MAR 28	2006	7								Q03008	10.1029/2005GC001076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005GC001076													WOS:000236728500003

Stomach contents of 1980 specimens collected by demersal trawl and seining were analysed. Nile tilapia originally known to be herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae has diversified its diet to include insects, fish, algae and plant materials. The major diet of fish < 5 cm total length was zooplankton whereas bigger fish included a wider range of food items in their diet. There was spatial variation in diet with insects and algae dominating in the gulf and open water habitats respectively. There was no seasonal variation in the food items ingested and diel feeding regime indicated that O. niloticus is a diurnal feeder. The shift in diet could be due to ecological and environmental changes in Lake Victoria, which have been associated with changes in composition and diversity of fish and invertebrate fauna, emergence and dominance of different flora including water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes ( Mart.) Solms-Laub., and algae communities. The feeding habit of O. niloticus is discussed in the context of changes occurring in the lake.

Seventy-nine eels caught at four different locations in different seasons were analyzed. Lipid content (1.3-30.0% of muscle weight) was more affected by season than by the location where the fish were caught, being the highest among the eels caught in May. Lipid content was higher in cultured eels than in wild eels. The predominant fatty acids in the eels were C18:1n-9 (24.4-33.0% of the total detected peak areas), C16:0 (17.7-22.0%), C16:1n-7 (7.0-10.2%), C22:6n-3 (2.4-6.8%), C18:1n-7 (2.9-6.2%), C18:2n-6 (0.6-6.1%), C20:5n-3 (1.5-5.1%), C14:0 (2.4-5.1%), C18:0 (3.4-4.5%), and C20:4n-6 (1.0-2.9%). Most fatty acids showed significantly more difference by location than by season. Cultured eels had significantly more saturated fatty acids (31.6-32.9%) and less monounsaturated fatty acids (42.5-43.3%) than wild eels (26.4-28.1% and 44.5-48.0%, respectively). Among the wild eels, estuarine eels had more n-3 fatty acids (12.2 and 14.8%) than lake eels (8.7-12.1%). Principal component analysis showed that the fatty acid composition could be an effective variable to classify fish according to the location where they were caught.

The results showed that abundance of eukaryotic microorganisms decreased with increasing salinity of the ponds whereas prokaryotes (heterotrophic bacteria and Archaea) were abundant in the hyper-saline ponds. Phototrophic picoplankton was found in a large range of salinity values (70 and 200 parts per thousand). Phototrophic non-flagellated nanoplankton which dominated in the first sampled pond was substituted by phototrophic flagellated nanoplankton in the other ponds. Heterotrophic nanoplankton dominated in the crystallizer pond but its quantitative importance declined in the less saline ponds. Diatoms and dinoflagellates were the major contributors to phytoplankton abundance in the first ponds (>90% of total abundance). Ciliated protozoa were found in all the ponds except in the crystallizer in which prokaryotes proliferated. Oligotrichida and Heterotrichida were the most abundant ciliate groups. Overall, species richness decreased with salinity gradient. We propose a simplified diagram of the Sfax saltern's food web showing the dominant role of the microbial loop along the salinity gradient.					; GUERMAZI, Wassim/KIB-8808-2024	elloumi, jannet/0000-0001-7365-0088; GUERMAZI, Wassim/0000-0003-4309-744X; 													0025-3154	1469-7769				MAR	2009	89	2					243	253		10.1017/S0025315408002269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315408002269													WOS:000265420100004

The present study analyzed the changes in rainfall concentration over East Africa (EA). Three matrices-the precipitation concentration index (PCI), the precipitation concentration degree (PCD), and the precipitation concentration period (PCP)-were used to examine the changes in rainfall during 1981-2021. The changes in spatial variance annually and during two seasons, namely, "long rains" (March to May [MAM]) and "short rain" (October to December [OND]), were estimated using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF). The study employed the robust statistical metrics of the Theil-Sen estimator to detect the magnitude of change and modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) to examine possible changes in rainfall concentration. The localized variation of the power series within the series for PCI, PCD, and PCP variability was performed using the continuous wavelet transform. The findings showed that the concentration of rainfall patterns of EA occurred in four months of the total months in a year over most parts, with the western sides experiencing uniform rainfall events throughout the year. The EOF analysis revealed a homogeneous negative pattern during the MAM season over the whole region for PCD, PCI, and PCP for the first mode, which signified reduced rainfall events. Moreover, the MMK analysis showed evidence of declining trends in the PCD annually and during the MAM season, while the opposite tendency was noted for the OND season where an upward trend in the PCD was observed. Interestingly, areas adjacent to Lake Victoria in Uganda and Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania showed increasing trends in the PCD for annual and seasonal time scales. The analysis to characterize the rainfall cycle and possible return period, considering the indices of PCD, PCI, and PCP, showed higher variability during the year 2000, while much variability was presented in the PCP for the annual period. During the MAM and OND seasons, a 1-year band as a dominant period of variability was observed in all the indices. Overall, the findings of the present study are crucial in detecting the observed changes in rainfall concentration for avoiding the loss of life and property, as well as for coping with potential changes in water resources.

Different approaches for estimating the environmental flow have developed to improve the river ecosystem's environmental and habitat conditions. The hydrological approach is considered in many studies to estimate environmental flows considering its advantages. Vimba vimba persa is an economically and ecologically valuable species in the Caspian Sea that spawns and reproduces naturally in the Gorganrood River downstream in April-May. After the construction of the Voshmgir dam on the Gorganrood River, the fish population has drastically reduced in recent decades. In this study, to investigate the effect of constructing the Voshmgir dam on the environmental flow of Gorganrood River, a wide range of hydrological methods, including Tennant, Tessman, Arkansas, Aquatic Base Flow, Flow Duration Curve, High Flow-Low Flow, and FDC Shifting have been used. Comparing the correlation between the mean monthly flow time series before and after the Voshmgir dam demonstrates remarkable changes, including Pearson (0.95 to 0.86), Spearman's rho (0.93 to 0.78), and Kendall's tau (0.78 to 0.61) as a consequence of dam construction. The results indicate that estimated environmental flow from Tennant (1.1, 3.4 to 1.3, 3.8 cms) and Aquatic Base Flow (0.5 to 1.8 cms) methods have led to inadequate estimation due to significant changes in flow in different months. The amount of environmental flow during April-May estimated from investigated methods indicates the dam negatively affected water allocation to meet the river downstream's ecological and environmental needs. The flow duration curve analysis confirms that the dam construction has caused the river flow to fluctuate significantly within the year. The dam construction has dramatically reduced the flow in April-May, a critical environmental and ecological season. The April-May period coincides with the river's flood season. The construction of the Voshmgir dam has caused the components of high flow in the environmental flow to face severe shortages.

While this approach has eased the rising demand for food, it is unclear whether it pays off in the long-run when costs associated with environmental consequences are considered. Using two case studies in Zhejiang Province, China, this paper analyzed field-based rice yields, fertilizer inputs, nitrogen leaching and greenhouse emissions and their socioeconomic values of different farm practices. The objective was to assess the trade-offs among economic gains from increased yield and environmental consequences of different paddy rice management practices. The results indicated short-term economic gains to farmers outweigh the environmental cost concerns. However, considering the lasting environmental effects, there is a significant imbalance toward a conservative farming practice. The results further indicated that synergies can be achieved if precision management practices are adopted. It was also indicated that a large spatial variation exists in yields and environmental impacts, suggesting 'one-size fits all' policies will likely be ineffective in reducing environmental impacts. Although only two case studies were demonstrated in this study, the approach may be generalized to other geographic regions to help guide paddy farmers in similar climatic and land use environments such as those in the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, to achieve synergic environment practices.

Samples collected from eleven different points of the Han River estuary and a coastal area were analysed, and the overall concentration of SMs downstream of the Han River was higher than of the coastal area. The extraction efficiencies were above 74% for the twelve SMs from three different classes when using the optimum pH and extraction with dichloromethane (DCM). Results for method detection limit (MDL), method quantification limit (MQL)and recovery obtained by the established analytical method showed that it is adequate for the determination of SMs in real samples. Among the SMs, Galaxolide (HHCB) and Iso E Super (OTNE) had the highest concentrations and detection frequencies. By using the established analytical method, our study showed regional and seasonal distribution of SMs originated from the Han River in estuary and coastal areas.

J	Rowe, C				Rowe, Cassandra			Late Holocene swamp transition in the Torres Strait, northern tropical Australia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Pollen and charcoal analyses are presented from the islands of Mua and Badu, western Torres Strait (northern Australia). Sediment core collections from island interior Melaleuca swamps provide a record of hydrological and vegetation change through the period c.2700 BP to present. Seasonally moist-dry open herbaceous habitats are recorded prior to extensive stable boundary swamp and swamp-forest establishment. This island swamp development is important in supporting vegetation differentiated from eucalypt woodland growth. The swamps also constitute an important dry season resource and refugia. Eucalypt-dominated woodland is evident throughout the records, but is increasingly influenced by fire (in structure and composition). This palaeoecological study provides the unique opportunity to explore long term inter-island and island-mainland environmental connection in the Torres Strait. It also facilitates an examination of regional late Holocene human-environment interaction, including discussions of islander colonisation, occupation and identity as taking place within archaeological research.

Year-round N2O production by benthic NOx reduction in a monomictic south-alpine lake	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, generated through microbial nitrogen (N) turnover processes, such as nitrification, nitrifier denitrification, and denitrification. Previous studies quantifying natural sources have mainly focused on soils and the ocean, but the potential role of terrestrial water bodies in the global N2O budget has been widely neglected. Furthermore, the biogeochemical controls on the production rates and the microbial pathways that produce benthic N2O in lakes are essentially unknown. In this study, benthic N2O fluxes and the contributions of the microbial pathways that produce N2O were assessed using N-15 label flow-through sediment incubations in the eutrophic, monomictic south basin of Lake Lugano in Switzerland. The sediments were a significant source of N2O throughout the year, with production rates ranging between 140 and 2605 nmol N2O h(-1) m(-2), and the highest observed rates coinciding with periods of water column stratification and stably anoxic conditions in the overlying bottom water. Nitrate (NO3-) reduction via denitrification was found to be the major N2O production pathway in the sediments under both oxygen-depleted and oxygen-replete conditions in the overlying water, while ammonium oxidation did not contribute significantly to the benthic N2O flux. A marked portion (up to 15 %) of the total NO3- consumed by denitrification was reduced only to N2O, without complete denitrification to N-2. These fluxes were highest when the bottom water had stabilized to a low-oxygen state, in contrast with the notion that stable anoxia is particularly conducive to complete denitrification without accumulation of N2O. This study provides evidence that lake sediments are a significant source of N2O to the overlying water and may produce large N2O fluxes to the atmosphere during seasonal mixing events.

Three types of shallow lakes have been described in this region: clear-vegetated, phytoplankton-turbid and inorganic-turbid. We analysed the periphyton and phytoplankton structure in five selected shallow lakes with contrasting optical characteristics. In the case of periphyton, we studied the variation in depth. Pigment compositions of both algal communities were analysed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. Additionally, we studied the taxonomic algal composition of both communities and the mass variables of periphyton. We observed a general decreasing pattern in the mean values of periphytic abundance with depth, and stratification in periphyton was generally consistent with the vertical profiles of pigments. Relationships between cell counts and pigments also suggested changes in the intracellular pigment concentration due to photoacclimation. In clear lakes, surface periphytic communities were co-dominated by chlorophytes and diatoms. In turbid lakes the surface assemblages were mainly represented by diatoms and the relative contribution of cyanobacteria increased with depth. The interaction between light and nutrients in different turbid scenarios may explain the patterns observed in the development of the periphytic community. We observed lower periphyton accrual in lakes that presented boundary values in the restrictions of either nutrients or light availability. In phytoplankton-turbid lakes, periphyton exhibited a considerable growth due to the rich nutrient conditions, but the community was dominated by the heterotrophic fraction and we also found algal groups well adapted to light limitation.

Temporal patterns in growth and survival of the round goby Neogobius melanostomus	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Monthly, overwinter and annual instantaneous growth rates for round goby Neogobius melanostomus were calculated with maximal growth occurring in July and August and almost no growth observed between ice appearance (October) and melt (March). Annual absolute growth rates averaged 27.3 +/- 1.9 mm for males and 19.8 +/- 2.4 mm for females. The most parsimonious CormackJollySeber model indicated that both the survival and recapture probabilities were dependent on sampling date, but not sex. Survival estimates remained high throughout the 13 month study with a median weekly survival probability of 0.920 (25 and 75% quartiles: 0.767 and 0.991), an overwinter survival probability of 99% and an annual survival rate of 67%. Survival probabilities were lowest for both sexes near the completion of the N. melanostomus reproductive season in July and August which supports existing evidence of higher mortality after reproduction, while challenging the paradigm that male N. melanostomus suffer comparatively higher mortality as a result of reproduction than females. Evidence indicating that growth and mortality rates are highest at the end of the reproductive season not only highlights seasonal variability in N. melanostomus natural history, but may also guide the control of this invasive species to periods when they are most vulnerable.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				JAN	2013	82	1					111	124		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03470.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03470.x								23331141					WOS:000313807000009

The phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll concentration in water were relatively low (typical of mesotrophic lakes), with a decreasing tendency when the water transparency significantly increased. The phytoplankton was not significantly correlated with the content of nutrients in water. The vast majority of phosphorus was in a form unavailable to phytoplankton, and the TN:TP ratio evidenced the role of nitrogen and phosphorus in colimitation of its development. The general evaluation of trophy based on TSI and TLI indicated meso-eutrophy or even slight eutrophy, because of partial assessments: TSITP, TLITP, and TLITN and domination of filamentous blue-green algae, which revealed a more advanced degree of eutrophication.					; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018; Stawecki, Konrad/AAP-2235-2021	Hutorowicz, Joanna/0000-0003-1263-5073; Stawecki, Konrad/0000-0002-8904-8996; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290; 													1230-1485						2013	22	3					793	800																WOS:000321027500017

Tracking water level changes of the Amazon Basin with space-borne remote sensing and integration with large scale hydrodynamic modelling: A review	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												With the improvement of remote sensing systems, in particular active sensors, our ability to make regular observations of the Amazon Basin has greatly increased. Water levels and other related features such as discharge, floodplain-river connectivity, and flood extent are now being monitored using space-borne sensors, thereby complimenting in situ gauging networks. This review concludes that the main advances remote sensing has had on our knowledge of hydrology includes the ability observe the seasonal cycles of the Amazon River across the entire basin, including the movement of the flood wave downstream. Flood extent can now be mapped, including the direction of floodplain flow, thanks to the extensive coverage provided by various active remote sensing systems. Our knowledge of the relationship between water levels in the main channel and the floodplain has been reassessed. It is now known that floodplain levels are related to the distance of the location from the main channel. The addition of new and future satellites, such as ICESat-1 and -2, GRACE and SWOT, will guarantee the continuation of research in this field and the continued advancement of knowledge and understanding of the Amazon Basin.

Macroinvertebrate communities associated with macrophyte habitats in a tropical man-made lake (Lake Taabo, Cote d'Ivoire)	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												An ecological study was done on Lake Taabo with the main objective of characterising macroinvertebrate communities associated with the microhabitats created mainly by Eichhornia crassipes and other littoral native macrophytes. We sampled organisms in patches of those aquatic macrophytes. Also, some abiotic variables (temperature, transparency, turbidity, pH, TDS, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, PO43- and SiO2-) were measured. Overall, forty-three taxa of macroinvertebrates were identified. Ten of them were exclusively associated with water hyacinth while five were only associated with littoral macrophytes. Macroinvertebrate taxa with some of the highest family richness were Gastropoda, Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Diptera. The taxon with highest density in both microhabitats was Chironomidae. Although higher values of taxonomic richness (Rs), the Shannon index (H') and evenness (J) were obtained with the water hyacinth habitat, significant differences between the two microhabitats were not observed. Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed that samples of E. crassipes collected in the dry season were characterised by Gastropoda and Odonata, as well as higher values of transparency and ammonia-nitrogen. Baetidae, Hydrophilidae, Chironomidae, Ceratopogonidae, Coenagrionidae, Naucoridae and Ostracoda were most abundant in both E. crassipes and littoral macrophyte habitats during the rainy season. This season was characterised by higher levels of nitrates and conductivity.																			1961-9502						2011		400							03	10.1051/kmae/2010035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2010035													WOS:000289847100006

Past environmental and climatic changes during the last 7200 cal yr BP in Adamawa plateau (Northern-Cameroun) based on fossil diatoms and sedimentary carbon isotopic records from Lake Mbalang	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Past limnological conditions of Lake Mbalang (7 degrees 19' N, 13 degrees 44' E, altitude: 1130 m) and vegetation type were reconstructed from diatoms and sedimentary stable carbon isotope records (delta C-13) since 7200 cal yr BP. The data showed that before 3600 cal yr BP, the water column was dominantly stable except around 5000-5300 cal yr BP where diatoms evidenced a mixed upper water layer and delta C-13 data suggest more forested vegetation in the landscape. These stable conditions can be explained by a strong monsoon flux and relatively northern position of the ITCZ that entailed high or low rainfall well distributed over the year, allowing the development of mountainous forest taxa. The decreasing trend of the monsoon flux towards the mid-Holocene was affected by several abrupt centennial to millennial-scale weakening at 6700, 5800-6000, 5000-5300, 4500 and 3600 cal yr BP. However, their impact on the vegetation is not visible, probably because rainfall distribution was favourable to forest maintenance or extension. After 3600 cal yr BP, the water column became very mixed as a result of more intense NE trade winds (Harmattan) that led at similar to 3000 cal yr BP to the establishment of savannah in the vegetation landscape. At that time, rainfall was probably reduced following the southward shift of the ITCZ, and the distribution of yearly rainfall was not favourable anymore to forest development. A strong seasonality with a marked dry season was established, conditions that maintained the savannah vegetation until today. Diatom data suggest the lake did not dry up during the last 7200 cal yr BP; however, a low lake level observed at 24002100 cal yr BP is contemporaneous to a climatic event evidenced in several areas of tropical Africa and could correspond to the southernmost position of the ITCZ. Other low lake levels are observed at 1800 and 1400 cal yr BP, after which the lake rose to its present level.

Puddles created by geophagous mammals are potential mineral sources for frugivorous bats (Stenodermatinae) in the Peruvian Amazon	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Natural licks are activity hotspots for frugivorous bats in the Peruvian Amazon. Large numbers of frugivorous bats congregate at licks to drink water. Because most Amazonian soils are relatively poor in nutrients, plants may contain low concentrations of some nutrients; consequently, frugivorous bats may face nutrient limitations. Accordingly, a potential explanation for lick visitation by bats is to obtain key limited resources. We assessed this hypothesis by comparing concentrations of cations (Ca, K, Mg, Na) in water at three licks and associated non-lick sites across years and seasons at Los Amigos Conservation Concession in south-eastern Peru. We also examined bat activity patterns between lick and non-lick sites. Regardless of the season, at licks > 10 bats per net h(-1) were captured compared with forest and gap sites where < 1 bat per net h(-1) was capture. At licks bats belonged primarily to the subfamily Stenodermatinae and over 70% were reproductive females. Although calcium magnesium and potassium concentrations varied across water sources sodium concentrations were consistently higher inn lick water (> 500 ppm) compared with creeks and oxbow lakes (<2 ppm) across seasons. Therefore, since sodium is one of the most limiting nutrients for vertebrates in the tropics, licks may function as sources of sodium (or other elements) for bats. In any case, licks are reliable potential sources of sodium in the south-eastern Peruvian Amazon an otherwise mineral-poor landscape.					; Harms, Kyle/AFU-6498-2022	Harms, Kyle/0000-0002-8842-382X; 													0266-4674	1469-7831				MAR	2010	26		2				173	184		10.1017/S0266467409990472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266467409990472													WOS:000274986000005

Macroinvertebrate communities of hypoxic habitats created by an invasive plant (Trapa natans) in the freshwater tidal Hudson River	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Like other floating-leaved plants, dense beds of water-chestnut (Trapa natans) may cause the underlying water to become hypoxic or even anoxic. Despite this potential stress, previous studies have reported dense and diverse invertebrate communities in water-chestnut beds. However, none of these previous studies simultaneously measured dissolved oxygen concentrations and invertebrate communities, leaving open the possibility that these study sites were not severely hypoxic. Here, we report the results of a study in which we measured both invertebrates and dissolved oxygen in a large, dense water-chestnut bed in the freshwater tidal Hudson River, New York. We sampled invertebrates at nine sites in the bed using a modified Downing box-sampler and a corer. We took samples both early in the growing season (June), when the water-chestnut canopy was not fully developed and hypoxia was only moderate, and in the middle of the growing season (July), when the canopy was fully developed and hypoxia was frequent and severe. We hypothesized that the effects of hypoxia would be more severe in July than in June, in the interior of the bed than near its edge, and for sediment-dwelling animals than for epiphytic animals. We also hypothesized that predatory invertebrates would be especially abundant in the most hypoxic sites, where fish predation presumably would be reduced. None of these hypotheses was supported. Instead, we found that all locations and microhabitats that we studied supported dense, diverse communities of invertebrates, including insects, oligochaetes, crustaceans, and other taxa. The mechanisms by which these animals tolerate short-term hypoxia need to be elucidated. We suggest that water-chestnut beds in the Hudson are valuable habitats for invertebrate biodiversity and production, and may contribute substantially to fish production.

The method was tested on bacterial assemblages from an alpine lake (Piburger See, Austria) at characteristic time points during the limnological year. Although on average 51% of 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained objects were hybridized with the oligonucleotide probe EUB I-III, we detected on average 80% of total biomass determined from DAPI staining. The assemblage was numerically dominated by cocci and rods < 0.6 mu m (mean cell volume = 0.024 mu m(3)). Only a minor part of these morphotypes could be hybridized (18 and 50%, respectively). In contrast, larger rods (0.087 mu m(3)), cocci (0.155 mu m(3)) and vibrio-shaped cells (0.073 mu m(3)) showed much higher probabilities to be detected by CARD-FISH. These morphotypes per se formed the highest contribution to total biomass, which explained the high detection efficiency of biomass with CARD-FISH. In addition, we determined the seasonal dynamics of morphotype distributions within 3 distinct phylogenetic lineages. Actinobacteria were predominately small rods and cocci, whereas bacteria from the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group formed mainly large rods, cocci and filaments. Betaproteobacteria showed the highest morphological variability. Within all lineages, distinct spatio-temporal dynamics of dominant morphotypes were observed. Thus, the approach presented here will allow for more detailed studies of the amount of carbon bound by different bacterial taxa. This is of relevance as distinct lineages can contribute much more to total bacterial biomass than to total bacterioplankton abundance.					; Salcher, Michaela/A-1141-2013	Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761; Salcher, Michaela/0000-0003-1063-6523													0948-3055	1616-1564					2009	54	2					113	126		10.3354/ame01269	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01269													WOS:000265158200001

Under a comparatively low range of water temperature variations, spawning appeared to be the main cause of seasonal changes in contents of quantitatively prominent and essential fatty acids in fish filets. In general, fish accumulated essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), Such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA), in their muscle tissue before reproductive seasons and then the PUFA seemed to be transferred into gonads during their formation. Hard roe of Siberian grayling had 3-4 times higher PUFA contents. than had that of the muscle tissue.

J	Tietjen, T; Wetzel, RG				Tietjen, T; Wetzel, RG			Extracellular enzyme-clay mineral complexes: Enzyme adsorption, alteration of enzyme activity, and protection from photodegradation	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Enzymes released extracellularly by micro-organisms have major functions in nutrient acquisition and organic matter degradation. Clay particles, common in many surface waters, can modify enzyme activity. Clay minerals are known to form aggregates with organic molecules, and the formation of enzyme-clay complexes could alter the level of activity. Montmorillonite clay and clay extracted from Elledge Lake (Tuscaloosa, Alabama) basin soil were combined with alkaline phosphatase, glucosidase, protease, and xylosidase solutions to assess adsorption and the effect of this adsorption on enzyme activity. Adsorption to Elledge Lake basin clay decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, and adsorption to montmorillonite was observed for all four enzymes with reductions in enzyme activities. Adsorption of substrate onto clay surfaces resulted in a concentration effect and increased enzyme activity associated with the particles. When enzyme-clay complexes were exposed to natural sunlight there was a decrease in enzyme activity, but this decrease was usually not significantly different from the adsorption only treatment. The formation of enzyme-clay complexes may serve to protect the enzymes from natural in situ photodegradation. The results indicate the complex interactive effects adsorption of enzymes to clay particles can have on the availability and capability of hydrolysis - reduction of enzyme reactivity, storage attached to clay particles with changes in transport and distribution, and protection from photodegradation.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				OCT	2003	37	4					331	339		10.1023/B:AECO.0000007044.52801.6b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000007044.52801.6b													WOS:000187003000001

Spatiotemporal Variation on Water Quality and Trophic State of a Tropical Urban Reservoir: A Case Study of the Lake Paranoa-DF, Brazil	WATER												Nutrient enrichment and eutrophication are among the main problems that lead to the deterioration of water quality in lakes and reservoirs. In this study, spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of organic and inorganic species of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water column of Lake Paranoa-DF (Brazil) were evaluated between 2016 and 2017. Seasonality was the main factor in the variations in concentrations of the investigated parameters. Additionally, we found differences in behavior for different nutrients and other variables that indicate different main sources of each nutrient as well as different biogeochemical processes predominating in each season. For example, the electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved silicon, PO43-, and NO3- showed mean concentrations significantly higher in the rainy season, indicating greater inputs in these periods (which is in part related to increasing soil leaching and runoff). Agricultural activities were the main source of NO3- and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) proved to be the main source of nutrients, mainly NH4+ and all forms of phosphorus. These two allochthonous sources are also the determining factors of the trophic state and the degradation of the water quality of Lake Paranoa. The lake is in the transition process from a mesotrophic to a eutrophic condition.

J	Dochin, K				Dochin, Kostadin			Functional and morphological groups in the phytoplankton of large reservoirs used for aquaculture in Bulgaria	BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												Functional and morphological concepts for the classification of phytoplankton are increasingly used in environmental studies of freshwater ecosystems. The present study focuses mainly on the application of the three approaches (FGs, MFGs, MBFGs) for morpho-functional classifications used for detecting changes in phytoplankton communities in five Bulgarian large reservoirs that have long been used for aquaculture. Totally 113 taxa of planktonic algae were identified. The representatives of Cyanoprokaryota (H1, M; 5a, 5b, 5e; III, VII), Chlorophyta (J; 3b, 9b; IV), Streptophyta (P, N; 8a; IV) and Bacillariophyceae (P, MP, D; 6b; VI) had the largest contribution to the abundance of algae in the studied reservoirs. Fourty-two dominant species from eighteen functional groups (FGs), fifteen morpho-functional groups (MFGs) and seven morphologically based functional groups (MBFGs) were found. The functional groups with most species were: H1, J, N, Lo, P M, most common among MFGs were: 5a, 5b, 5e, 6b, 8a and 9b, and among MBFGs: III, IV, VI and VII. The large gelatinous colonial (M; 5b; VII) and filamentous (H1; 5a, 5e, III) cyanoprokaryotes, some of which are potentially toxic species indicative of eutrophication, were among the most common taxa in three of the studied reservoirs. According to the presented study, the three morpho-functional environmental concepts provide an important tool for understanding the seasonal changes in phytoplankton communities, as well as for assessing the environmental status of heavily modified freshwater reservoirs.					; Dochin, Kostadin/AAW-6181-2020	Dochin, Kostadin/0000-0002-0058-1699; 													1310-0351					FEB	2019	25	1					166	175																WOS:000459986000023

Eight PBDE congeners (BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-100, BDE-99, BDE-154, BDE-153, BDE-183 and BDE-209) were simultaneously analysed in bulk and wet atmospheric deposition, as well as in ambient air (gaseous/particulate phases), twice a month over a 12-month period (May 2008-May 2009). The total air concentration of I pound 8PBDEs ranged between 12 and 185 pg m(-3), and the seasonal variations of PBDE levels were controlled by air temperature (except for BDE-209). Regarding bulk deposition, I pound 8PBDE flux was in the range 5-94 ng m(-2) day(-1), and it was positively correlated with atmospheric particulate phase PBDE concentrations. Meanwhile, the measured wet deposition flux of I pound 8PBDE ranged between 2 and 24 ng m(-2) day(-1), and its median contribution to bulk deposition was 39% only, which highlights the importance of dry deposition.					; TLILI, khawla/M-8157-2019; Labadie, Pierre/F-9297-2015	TLILI, Khawla/0000-0001-9583-1111; Labadie, Pierre/0000-0001-7184-6327; Alliot, Fabrice/0000-0002-1335-1294													0049-6979					MAY	2012	223	4					1543	1553		10.1007/s11270-011-0963-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-0963-x													WOS:000303385800008
J	Young, JD; Yan, ND				Young, Joelle D.; Yan, Norman D.			Modification of the diel vertical migration of Bythotrephes longimanus by the cold-water planktivore, Coregonus artedi	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The weak diel vertical migration observed in the large cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus seems contradictory to the predator-avoidance hypothesis that predicts large zooplankton should have long migration amplitudes. However, cold-water planktivores, especially Coregonus spp., are a main source of mortality for Bythotrephes and hence a deeper migration would result in a greater overlap with these hypolimnetic planktivores. We hypothesized that Coregonus artedi (cisco) modifies the normal vertical migration pattern of Bythotrephes, such that the latter stays higher in the water column during the day and thus migrates less extremely at night. 2. The vertical distribution of Bythotrephes during the day was determined from single visits to six lakes in Ontario, Canada, all of which contain warm-water, epilimnetic planktivores but differing in whether they contain cisco. One lake of each fish type was sampled day and night every 2-3 weeks over the ice-free season to examine daytime depths and migration amplitude. 3. The vertical migration of Bythotrephes differed in the presence and absence of cisco. In the lakes with cisco, there were significantly fewer Bythotrephes in the hypolimnion and they were higher in the water column during the day. Migration amplitude was smaller in the cisco than in the non-cisco lake. These observations were not attributable to differences in physical factors, and, although not conclusively attributable to cisco, are consistent with an effect of cisco. 4. We suggest that diurnal depth selection by Bythotrephes in lakes containing cisco is a trade-off between the risk of predation by warm- versus cold-water predators, balanced by the benefits of increased temperature and feeding rates near the surface. Even in lakes without cisco, however, the vertical migration of Bythotrephes was less than expected, suggesting that diurnal depth selection is a balance between the risk from warm-water planktivores and access to sufficient light to feed effectively.

Surface water samples have been collected seasonally from four rivers and five lakes for a period of two years. Solid-phase extraction followed by gas chromatographic techniques with electron capture detection was used for the determination of the compounds. The most commonly encountered organochlorine pesticides in surface waters were the isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, aldrin, dieldrin and endosulfan sulfate. In some cases the concentrations detected were higher than the qualitative target levels set by the European Union, especially for hexachlorocyclohexane and aldrin.

This river and its tributaries drain both urban and agricultural areas. Fish were caught with sieves along a 100 m stretch demarcated in every sampling site, where environmental variables were also measured. A total of 3508 individuals belonging to 31 species were collected. Fish abundance and environmental data matrices were submitted to a multivariate analysis of co-inertia. Two axes were retained for interpretation (total variance explained = 63.65%) indicating that pH, water temperature, conductivity, chemical dissolved oxygen, and turbidity, all have an influence on fish assemblage structure. The co-structure found (fish assemblages and physicochemical variables) is correlated in both of the axes considered (r = 0.73 and r = 0.68, respectively), and is statistically significant (Monte Carlo test, P < 0.001). This co-structure is regulated by seasonality, but is influenced by fish habitat preferences, spawning and available food, the extent and effects of anthropogenic activities (domestic sewage, agriculture, ranching, urban areas) and the position of sampling stations along the watershed.

Herein, two tetrapod ichnoassociations from three new ichnosites, within Cisuralian and Guadalupian volcanosedimentary terrestrial successions (the Lower Red Unit and the Upper Red Unit deposits) of the Castellar de n'Hug sub-basin (Catalan Pyrenees, NE Iberian Peninsula) are presented. Tetrapod ichnology in combination with stratigraphic and facies analyses permit a characterisation of these ecosystems. The sedimentary deposits show an evolution from fluvial meandering systems to playa-lake floodplains, denoting increased aridification and seasonality under a monsoonal regime. The ichnofossil record shows how tetrapod assemblages shifted from a prevalence of non-amniotes and eureptiles to a dominance of therapsids, eureptiles and parareptiles. The reported ichnotaxa are distributed in two ichnoassociations. The first preserves Batrachichnus, Dromopus, Hyloidichnus, Characichnos and an indeterminate tetrapod morphotype, whereas the second is defined by the presence of Dromopus, Hyloidichnus, Brontopus antecursor and Pachypes. The stratigraphically older ichnoassociation, preserved in volcaniclastic and fluvial deposits, presents features of the early Erpetopus biochron, whereas the stratigraphically younger one, preserved in playa-lake deposits, is constrained to the Brontopus sub-biochron. Biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic data suggest a late Cisuralian to middle Guadalupian age for the whole succession. The ichnoassemblage highlights a palaeobiogeographical connection between the Pyrenean Basin and other peri-Tethyan basins, which allows us to expand our knowledge about the palaeoecology and palaeobiodiversity of the Cisuralian to Guadalupian terrestrial ecosystems.

Data were collected bimonthly from thirty reservoir sampling sites from October 2016 to September 2017 during the dry and rainy seasons. A principal component analysis determined the abiotic factors that explained most of the data variations, then a multivariate permutational variance analysis showed significant differences in abiotic variables between the dry and rainy periods. The shrimp were more abundant during the dry season compared to the rainy season, and the M. amazonicum species was more abundant than the M. jelskii species across both periods. Additionally, redundancy analysis for each seasonal period indicated that seasonal abiotic factor variations caused different responses in the abundance of intrapopulation groups (females, males and juveniles) in the two studied shrimp species. The present results suggest that related shrimp species may present different responses to seasonal abiotic factor variations, suggesting these ecological differences may be crucial to ensure a stable coexistence. Moreover, high plasticity appears to provide M. amazonicum and M. jelskii a good adaptation, especially to life in reservoirs, which are unstable environments.					; Nascimento, Whandenson/AAK-3691-2021; Cascon, Paulo/I-1017-2012; de Lucena, Isis/AAO-3158-2020; Pinheiro, Allysson/A-8726-2010	Machado do Nascimento, Whandenson/0000-0002-4304-0980; Cascon, Paulo/0000-0003-4807-5995; Pinheiro, Allysson/0000-0003-1565-6371; Campos de Lucena, Isis/0000-0002-2282-7020													0394-9370	1828-7131				SEP 2	2020	32	5					409	432		10.1080/03949370.2020.1746404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2020.1746404		APR 2020											WOS:000527518400001

The optimized procedures were shown to be efficient and reliable for the routine analysis of both free and total MCs in lake sediment samples, as indicated by the minimal adverse impact of sediment organic matter on the recovery of free MCs and yield of MMPB (2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid).

On a global scale, environmental drivers controlling the distribution of GDGTs in lake systems have been described extensively. However, the drivers that control down-core sedimentary GDGT composition within single lake systems are still poorly constrained. Here, we analysed GDGTs in a sediment core collected from Lake Ho center dot glwo center dot rth (Bavaria, Germany) covering the last -1100 years. The increase in ratio sigma IIIa/sigma IIa values (a ratio which captures the variation of 3 structural isomers of penta- and hexamethylated brGDGTs respectively) reflects a higher contribution of branched (br) GDGTs from aquatic sources after 1800 CE. This is synchronous with a high nutrient input as a result of increased local anthropogenic activities. The climate proxy methylation of branched tetraethers (MBT'5ME) reveals a pattern that deviates from the anticipated temperature changes during the last millennium. Instead, high MBT'5ME values from -880 to 1120 CE coincide with a period of increased soil input, resulting from lake damming and/or construction of the Ho center dot glwo center dot rth monastery. Decreased values after 1800 CE until present date correspond to a higher contribution of aquatic brGDGTs, with changes in the dependency between Ia and IIa suggesting a direct influence of bacterial community changes on the MBT'5ME. The proxy cyclisation of branched tetraethers (CBT') shows a linear increase with time, and a stepwise increase at 1700 CE, when a creek stream inflow channel was rerouted. Over time, MBT'5ME decreases gradually, while CBT' and sigma IIIa/sigma IIa increase. This is hypothesized to be potentially caused by decreasing water depth over time and/or post- or syn-sedimentary production of GDGTs. The degree of cyclization (DC') shows variations on shorter timescales, possibly driven by the lake mixing regime and water column redox conditions. Our results indicate that caution must be taken when interpreting GDGTs for paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental reconstruction considering the possible influence of shifts in the provenance of brGDGTs. Further studies focusing on both sedimentary and intact polar lipids are highly recommended to constrain the source (water column, or sedimentary production) of GDGTs in lake sediments.					; Acharya, Sudip/MQY-8335-2025; De Jonge, Cindy/GLN-7785-2022	Acharya, Sudip/0009-0006-8692-0300; 													0146-6380	1873-5290				DEC	2023	186								104689	10.1016/j.orggeochem.2023.104689	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2023.104689		OCT 2023											WOS:001149861700001

Lake depth is a crucial external parameter for the implementation of lake models into NWP systems, since it controls the dynamical range of lake temperature amplitudes on diurnal to seasonal time scales. However, a global lake-depth dataset does not exist at present. A novel method to derive an effective lake depth on the basis of the remotely-sensed lake water-surface temperature (LWST) is presented here. A technique is proposed to adjust a simple two-layer Fresh-water Lake model (FLake) depth such that simulated annual cycle of LWST matches satellite-based LWST climatology as closely as possible.

Results are also compared with those obtained from current and temperature measurements in the lake. Agreement was satisfactory in all cases. Model predictions and measurements both indicated that only three internal seiche modes are excited: the 1st mode and the 3rd mode, which are Kelvin-seiche oscillations, and the 12th mode, which is a Poincare seiche. The model, driven by winds from different directions, demonstrates that the wind field, constrained by the local topography, determines which of the modes is generated.																			0024-3590					JAN	2005	50	1					207	216		10.4319/lo.2005.50.1.0207	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.1.0207													WOS:000226406800019
J	Grey, J; Kelly, A; Jones, RI				Grey, J; Kelly, A; Jones, RI			High intraspecific variability in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of lake chironomid larvae	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Stable isotope analyses of chironomid trophic interactions have recently indicated the potential importance of isotopically light biogenic methane as a carbon source. Mass balance of isotope ratios suggests that small proportional differences in ingestion of such an isotopically distinct basal resource by individual consumers can result in considerable intraspecific variability. To test this, we collected individual larvae of two closely related chironomid species (Chironomus anthracinus and Chironomus plumosus) from six lakes and analyzed their delta(13)C and delta(15)N. Intraspecific variability in larval delta(13)C and delta(15)N values was greater in lakes where chironomids were more C-13 depleted. C plumosus exhibited higher intraspecific variability relative to C anthracinus. In two lakes, individual C. plumosus exhibited a range of 35parts per thousand for delta(13)C and 16% for delta(13) N (equivalent to five trophic levels). There was a strong positive relationship between larval delta(13)C and delta(15)N, both between individuals from the same lake and also between lakes, suggesting that the underlying causative mechanisms are similar. Furthermore, larvae from deeper sites, which are more susceptible to prolonged anoxia, exhibited greater intraspecific variability, and larger larvae were significantly C-13 depleted. Such high intraspecific variability can confound the interpretation of benthic food web stable isotope values. We advocate the reporting of more intraspecific isotopic variability as a means to further examine niche breadth and feeding behavior.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2004	49	1					239	244		10.4319/lo.2004.49.1.0239	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.1.0239													WOS:000188381100026

Hydrological Conditions Control P Loading and Aquatic Metabolism in an Oligotrophic, Subtropical Estuary	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Using high-resolution measures of aquatic ecosystem metabolism and water quality, we investigated the importance of hydrological inputs of phosphorus (P) on ecosystem dynamics in the oligotrophic, P-limited coastal Everglades. Due to low nutrient status and relatively large inputs of terrestrial organic matter, we hypothesized that the ponds in this region would be strongly net heterotrophic and that pond gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) would be the greatest during the "dry," euhaline estuarine season that coincides with increased P availability. Results indicated that metabolism rates were consistently associated with elevated upstream total phosphorus and salinity concentrations. Pulses in aquatic metabolism rates were coupled to the timing of P supply from groundwater upwelling as well as a potential suite of hydrobiogeochemical interactions. We provide evidence that freshwater discharge has observable impacts on aquatic ecosystem function in the oligotrophic estuaries of the Florida Everglades by controlling the availability of P to the ecosystem. Future water management decisions in South Florida must include the impact of changes in water delivery on downstream estuaries.

Energy Density of Bloaters in the Upper Great Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We evaluated the energy density of bloaters Coregonus hoyi as a function of fish size across Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior in 2008-2009 and assessed how differences in energy density are related to factors such as biomass density of bloaters and availability of prey. Additional objectives were to compare energy density between sexes and to compare energy densities of bloaters in Lake Michigan between two time periods (1998-2001 and 2008-2009). For the cross-lake comparisons in 2008, energy density increased with fish total length (TL) only in Lake Michigan. Mean energy density adjusted for fish size was 8% higher in bloaters from Lake Superior than in bloaters from Lake Huron. Relative to fish in these two lakes, small (<125 mm TL) bloaters from Lake Michigan had lower energy density, whereas large (>175 mm TL) bloaters had higher energy density. In 2009, energy density increased with bloater size, and mean energy density adjusted for fish size was about 9% higher in Lake Michigan than in Lake Huron (Lake Superior was not sampled during 2009). Energy density of bloaters in Lake Huron was generally the lowest among lakes, reflecting the relatively low densities of opossum shrimp Mysis diluviana and the relatively high biomass of bloaters reported for that lake. Other factors, such as energy content of prey, growing season, or ontogenetic differences in energy use strategies, may also influence cross-lake variation in energy density. Mean energy density adjusted for length was 7% higher for female bloaters than for male bloaters in Lakes Michigan and Huron. In Lake Superior, energy density did not differ between males and females. Finally, energy density of bloaters in Lake Michigan was similar between the periods 2008-2009 and 1998-2001, possibly due to a low population abundance of bloaters, which could offset food availability changes linked to the loss of prey such as the amphipods Diporeia spp.						Roseman, Edward/0000-0002-5315-9838; Bunnell, David/0000-0003-3521-7747; Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422													0002-8487						2012	141	3					772	780		10.1080/00028487.2012.675911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.675911													WOS:000306462100019

One of the most controversial issues in biomanipulation research relates to the conditions required for top-down control to cascade down from piscivorous fish to phytoplankton. Numerous experiments have demonstrated that Phytoplankton biomass Top-Down Control (PTDC) occurs under the following conditions: (i) in short-term experiments, (ii) shallow lakes with macrophytes, and (iii) deep lakes of slightly eutrophic or mesotrophic state. Other experiments indicate that PTDC is unlikely in (iv) eutrophic or hypertrophic deep lakes unless severe light limitation occurs, and (v) all lakes characterised by extreme nutrient limitation (oligo to ultraoligotrophic lakes). 2. Key factors responsible for PTDC under conditions (i) to (iii) are time scales preventing the development of slow-growing inedible phytoplankton (i), shallow depth allowing macrophytes to become dominant primary producers (ii), and biomanipulation-induced reduction of phosphorus (P) availability for phytoplankton (iii). 3. Under conditions (iv) and (v), biomanipulation-induced reduction of P-availability might also occur but is insufficient to alter the epilimnetic P-content enough to initiate effective bottom-up control (P-limitation) of phytoplankton. In these cases, P-loading is much too high (iv) or P-content in the lake much too low (v) to initiate or enhance P-limitation of phytoplankton by a biomanipulation-induced reduction of P-availability. However, PTDC may exceptionally result under condition (iv) if high mixing depth and or light attenuation cause severe light limitation of phytoplankton. 4. Recognition of the five different conditions reconciles previous seemingly contradictory results from biomanipulation experiments and provides a sound basis for successful application of biomanipulation as a tool for water management.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2002	47	12					2282	2295		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00989.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00989.x													WOS:000179382700002

The paper applied detailed hydrometric information from the years 1971-2010 concerning water level fluctuations, water temperature, terms of the commencement and end of ice phenomena and ice cover, as well as meteorological data concerning air temperature and atmospheric precipitation, and monthly and seasonal NAO indices. The performed analysis suggests that the majority of analysed hydrological characteristics of Lake Morskie Oko was not prone to variability of NAO intensity in its various phases. The situation results from the local conditions, particularly responsible for the course of processes and phenomena in Lake Morskie Oko, simultaneously obscuring the effect of macroscale factors.

As biotransformation of CAHs in the impacted river sediments might be an effective remediation strategy, we investigated the determinants of the microbial community structure of eutrophic, CAH-polluted sediments of the Zenne River. Based on PCR-DGGE analysis, a high diversity of Bacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria, Geobacteraceae, methanogenic archaea, and CAH-respiring Dehalococcoides was found. Depth in the riverbed, organic carbon content, CAH content and texture of the sediment, pore water temperature and conductivity, and concentrations of toluene and methane significantly contributed to the variance in the microbial community structure. On a meter scale, CAH concentrations alone explained only 6% of the variance in the Dehalococcoides and sulfate-reducing communities. On a cm-scale, however, CAHs explained 14.5-35% of the variation in DGGE profiles of Geobacteraceae, methanogens, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and Bacteria, while organic carbon content explained 2-14%. Neither the presence of the CAH reductive dehalogenase genes tceA, bvcA, and vcrA, nor the community structure of the targeted groups significantly differed between riverbed locations showing either no attenuation or reductive dechlorination, indicating that the microbial community composition was not a limiting factor for biotransformation in the Zenne sediments.					; Smidt, Hauke/D-7054-2014; Springael, Dirk/D-4085-2014	Springael, Dirk/0000-0002-1100-7414; Smidt, Hauke/0000-0002-6138-5026; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				MAR	2014	87	3					715	732		10.1111/1574-6941.12260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1574-6941.12260								24266435					WOS:000332207200014

Assessing sex-related chick provisioning in greater flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus parents using capture-recapture models	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												In sexually dimorphic species, the parental effort of the smaller sex may be reduced due to competitive exclusion in the feeding areas by the larger sex or physiological constraints. However, to determine gender effects on provisioning patterns, other intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting parental effort should be accounted for. Greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) exhibit sexual size dimorphism. In Fuente de Piedra colony, the lake dries out almost completely during the breeding season and both parents commute between breeding and foraging sites >130km away during the chick-rearing period. Applying multistate capture-recapture models to daily observations of marked parents, we determined the effects of sex, and their interactions with other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, on the probability of chick desertion and sojourn in the colony and feeding areas. Moreover, using stable isotopes in the secretions that parents produce to feed their chicks, we evaluated sex-specific use of wetlands. The probability of chick attendance (complementary to chick desertion) was >0 center dot 98. Chick desertion was independent of parental sex, but decreased with parental age. Females stayed in the feeding areas for shorter periods [mean: 7 center dot 5 (95% CI: 6 center dot 0-9 center dot 4) days] than males [9 center dot 2 (7 center dot 3-11 center dot 8) days]. Isotopic signatures of secretions did not show sex differences in delta C-13, but males' secretions were enriched in delta N-15, suggesting they fed on prey of higher trophic levels than females. Both parents spent approximately 1day in the colony, but females prolonged their mean stay when the lake dried out. Females also allocated more time to foraging in the flooded areas remaining in the colony, likely because they were energetically more stressed than males. The results indicate that sex-specific provisioning behaviour in greater flamingo is related to differential effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Males seem forage less efficiently than females, whereas females' body condition seems to be lower after feeding the chick. Our methodology may be extended to species that feed on distant food sources and that do not visit their offspring daily, to elucidate patterns of chick-provisioning behaviour.

In this paper we show how eutrophication affects seasonal changes in the taxonomic structure of bacterioplankton and whether these changes are associated with the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria of the genera Legionella and Aeromonas. The subject of the study was a unique system of interconnected lakes in northern Poland (Great Masurian Lakes system), characterized by the presence of eutrophic gradient. We found that the taxonomic structure of the bacterial community in eutrophic lakes was significantly season dependent. No such significant seasonal changes were observed in meso-eutrophic lakes. We found that there is a specific taxonomic composition of bacteria associated with the occurrence of Legionella spp. The highest positive significant correlations were found for families Pirellulaceae, Mycobacteriaceae and Gemmataceae. The highest negative correlations were found for the families Sporichthyaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, the uncultured families of class Verrucomicrobia and Chitinophagaceae. We used also an Automatic Neural Network model to estimate the relative abundance of Legionella spp. based on the relative abundance of dominant bacterial families. In the case of Aeromonas spp. we did not find a clear relationship with bacterial communities inhabiting lakes of different trophic state. Our research has shown that anthropogenic eutrophication causes significant changes in the taxonomic composition of lake bacteria and contributes to an increase in the proportion of potentially pathogenic Legionella spp.					Grabowska'Grucza, Karolina/KIB-2548-2024	Grabowska-Grucza, Karolina/0000-0001-9170-019X													2045-2322					OCT 10	2023	13	1							17076	10.1038/s41598-023-43234-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-43234-3								37816753					WOS:001099084800009

Previous studies have used a 1D model to reproduce the temporal evolution of physical and biogeochemical variables in this lake. The question that arises then is how appropriate is a 1D approach to represent the dynamic of a spatially heterogeneous system, where there are non-linear dependencies between variables. Field data, a N-P-Z model coupled to both a 1D and a 3D hydrodynamic model, a 1D diffusion-reaction equation and scaling analysis are used to understand the role of spatial variability, expressed as phytoplankton patchiness, in the modelling of primary production. The analysis and results are used to investigate the effect of horizontal variability in the forcing and in the free mechanisms that affect the growth of patterns. The study shows that the use of averaged properties in a 1D approach may produce misleading results in the presence of localised patches, in terms of both concentration and composition of phytoplankton. The reason lies in the fact that the calibration process of ecological parameters in the 1D model appears to be site and process specific. That is, it depends on the pattern's characteristics and the underlying physical processes causing them. And this is a critical point for the success of numerical simulations under spatial variability. In this study, it is also shown that a length scale based on diffusion and growth rate of phytoplankton could be used as a criterion to assess the appropriateness of the 1D assumption.

The PFGE community fingerprints showed a number of cross-system similarities in the genome size distribution with a general dominance of genomes in the 30-48, 50-70 and 145-200 kb size fractions, and with many of the specific genome sizes detected in all the investigated habitats. However, large differences in community fingerprints were also observed between the investigated sites, and some virus genome sizes were found only in specific biotopes (e.g. lake water), in specific ecosystems (e.g. a particular lake) or even in specific microhabitats (e.g. a particular sediment stratum).

Phytoplankton succession affects the composition of Polynucleobacter subtypes in humic lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Phytoplankton influence the composition of bacterial communities, but the taxonomic specificity of algal-bacterial interactions is unclear due to the aggregation of ecologically distinct bacterial populations by community characterization methods. Here we examine whether phytoplankton seasonal succession affects the composition of subtypes within the cosmopolitan freshwater bacterial genus Polynucleobacter. Changes in the composition of Polynucleobacter subtypes were characterized in samples collected weekly from May to August in 2003 and 2008 from three humic lakes using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the protein-encoding cytochrome c oxidase ccoN gene. Changes in phytoplankton population abundances explained, on average, 30% of temporal variation in the composition of Polynucleobacter subtypes and the interaction between phytoplankton and the environment explained an additional 18% of temporal variation. The effect of phytoplankton on specific Polynucleobacter subtypes was experimentally confirmed by changes in Polynucleobacter subtype composition following incubation with different phytoplankton assemblages or a no-phytoplankton control. Phytoplankton-associated subtypes and differentiation in substrate use among subtypes likely contribute to the effects of phytoplankton on Polynucleobacter subtype composition. Interactions between unique Polynucleobacter populations and phytoplankton highlight the ecological significance and specificity of species interactions in freshwater communities.

Seasonal variation of solitary wave properties in Lake Constance	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The properties of internal solitary waves (ISWs) depend on the stratification of the water body. In most climatic regions the stratification in lakes and oceans varies during the year, and hence the properties of the ISWs can also be expected to change over the seasons. On the basis of a long-term temperature time series recorded over 6 years, this paper investigates seasonal changes in the characteristic properties of ISWs in Lake Uberlingen, a subbasin of Lake Constance. A large number of ISWs with amplitudes ranging from 3 m to 30 m were identified. More than 15% of the leading ISWs of a wave train were associated with density inversions, often indicating shear instabilities or trapped cores. For all waves the propagation depth and the value of a nonlinearity index nl(p) providing the degree of nonlinearity were determined, propagation depth being the rest height of the isotherm undergoing maximum displacement and nlp the ratio between wave amplitude and propagation depth. The index nlp was found to be a good parameter for predicting the occurrence of inversions. The statistical analysis of the wave properties derived from the observations revealed that the degree of nonlinearity of the ISWs changes with season. Complementary to the statistical analysis, the seasonally averaged ISW properties were compared with wave prototypes obtained numerically from the Dubreil-Jacotin-Long (DJL) and the stratified Korteweg-deVries (KdV) models. The simulations indicate that the typical stratification and its seasonal variation are responsible for the degree and the seasonality of nonlinearity of the ISWs.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				APR 14	2012	117								C04026	10.1029/2011JC007403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JC007403													WOS:000302857600002

This has been achieved by considerable investments in water protection, which were made mainly to improve municipal and industrial wastewater purification. We investigated whether these water protection measures have decreased phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in Finnish rivers and lakes. In addition, possible trends in chlorophyll a concentrations in lakes were studied. The data consisted of a total of over 68 000 monitoring results of 22 rivers and 173 lakes (or sub-basins of lakes) with different types of catchment areas. The study period covered the years 1975-2000 and the non-parametric Kendall Tau b and Seasonal Kendall tests were applied for detecting trends. Decreasing nutrient concentration trends were typical in many lakes and rivers earlier polluted by municipal and industrial wastewaters. Increasing nutrient concentration trends were common in smaller rivers and lakes receiving diffuse loading from, agriculture. The results show that the investments directed towards wastewater purification have effectively improved the quality of Finnish inland waters. However, no clear effects of decreasing non-point loading were found. Thus, more. effective measures should be directed towards decreasing non-point source loading. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Feng, ZH; Song, XX; Yu, ZM				Feng, Zhihua; Song, Xiuxian; Yu, Zhiming			Seasonal and spatial distribution of matrix-bound phosphine and its relationship with the environment in the Changjiang River Estuary, China	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Sediment is commonly considered as a source of phosphine, which is a highly toxic and reactive atmospheric trace gas. This study aims to investigate the seasonal and spatial distribution of matrix-bound phosphine (MBP) and its relationship with the environment in the Changjiang River Estuary. A total of 43 surface sediments were collected in four seasons of 2006, and concentrations of MBP and relative environmental factors were analyzed. MBP ranged from 1.93 to 94.86 ng kg(-1) dry weight (dw) with an average concentration of 17.14 ng kg(-1) dw. The concentrations of MBP in the tipper estuary were, higher than those in the lower estuary, which could be attributed to greater pollutant inputs in the upper estuary. The concentrations of MBP also varied with season, with November > August > May > February. Significant correlations existed between MBP and total phosphorus (TP), organic phosphorus (OP), inorganic phosphorus (W), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), the grain size, and redox potential (Eh), suggesting that these sedimentary environmental characteristics played an important role in controlling the MBP levels in the sediments. Notably, there were positive linear relationships between the concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), TP, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) in bottom water and MBP in sediments. These relationships might be very complicated and need further exploration. This work is the first comprehensive study of the seasonal and spatial distribution of MBP in sediments and its relationships with environmental factors in a typical estuary, and will lead to deeper understanding of the phosphorus (P) biogeochemical cycle.

A total of 114 species of protozoa, including phytomastigophorans, zoomastigophorans, amoebae and ciliates, were identified from 120 polyurethane foam unit (PFU) samples exposed at four stations and from various types of natural substrates. Of the 114 taxa, 36 core species were found on PFU substrates and 23 of these were found on natural ones. Protozoan abundance and chemical physical parameters at nine sampling stations, four in the western lake and five in the eastern part, indicate trophic gradient changes along the lake. Seasonal variations in the species composition of major groups at littoral PFU sampling stations illustrate the effect of a severe algal bloom on the protozoan community structure. Temporal and spatial distributions of individual abundance as functions of water temperature and trophic status were revealed. This study demonstrates again that the PFU artificial substrate method samples protozoan communities more effectively than routine natural substrate methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

The effects of light availability in shallow, turbid waters: a mesocosm study	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Seasonal patterns of water transparency in turbid Pampean lakes suggest that the amount of seston is strongly influenced by incident solar radiation. However, the unequivocal identification of light as the major forcing variable is precluded due its co-variation with several potentially confounding variables. In order to specifically investigate the role of light, we performed a mesocosm (3000 L) experiment aimed at investigating the effects of different degrees of light availability on planktonic community structure and metabolism. The experimental setup successfully mimicked the light limiting conditions prevailing in Pampean turbid lakes. We used neutral density filters to create four light treatments, approximately covering the natural annual range of incident irradiance. Our results are consistent with field patterns and light-limitation theory: (i) light attenuation and (ii) primary production increased with light availability. In contrast, the abundance of most grazers displayed negative relationships with light availability. The decreases in the density of grazers could have resulted from changes in the nutritional value of the food. This possibility is also supported by (iii) decreases in seston P-content and (iv) increases in community respiration with increasing light availability.					; Torremorell, Ana/AAS-3083-2021	Torremorell, Ana/0000-0003-3903-6863; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; Unrein, Fernando/0000-0002-8592-1858; Diovisalvi, Nadia/0000-0002-1054-8323; Llames, Maria Eugenia/0000-0001-6984-8016													0142-7873	1464-3774				DEC	2009	31	12					1517	1529		10.1093/plankt/fbp086	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbp086													WOS:000271576000007

Microcystins (MCs) concentration in hepatopancreas was quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The MCs concentrations in hepatopancreas were higher at Site 1 than those at other sites, which was in agreement with the changes of intracellular MCs concentrations in the water column. There was a significant correlation between MCs concentrations in the hepatopancreas and that in the seston, suggesting that spatial variances of MCs; concentrations in hepatopancreas among the five sites were due to spatial changes of toxic Microcystis cells in the water column. PCCA indicates that in addition to Microcystis, other factors (e.g., water temperature) also substantially affected the accumulation of MCs in hepatopancreas of the snail.

Western Indian Ocean marine and terrestrial records of climate variability: a review and new concepts on land-ocean interactions since AD 1660	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												We examine the relationship between three tropical and two subtropical western Indian Ocean coral oxygen isotope time series to surface air temperatures (SAT) and rainfall over India, tropical East Africa and southeast Africa. We review established relationships, provide new concepts with regard to distinct rainfall seasons, and mean annual temperatures. Tropical corals are coherent with SAT over western India and East Africa at interannual and multidecadal periodicities. The subtropical corals correlate with Southeast African SAT at periodicities of 16-30 years. The relationship between the coral records and land rainfall is more complex. Running correlations suggest varying strength of interannual teleconnections between the tropical coral oxygen isotope records and rainfall over equatorial East Africa. The relationship with rainfall over India changed in the 1970s. The subtropical oxygen isotope records are coherent with South African rainfall at interdecadal periodicities. Paleoclimatological reconstructions of land rainfall and SAT reveal that the inferred relationships generally hold during the last 350 years. Thus, the Indian Ocean corals prove invaluable for investigating land-ocean interactions during past centuries.

J	Lessmann, O; Fernández, JE; Martínez-Cruz, K; Peeters, F				Lessmann, Ole; Encinas Fernandez, Jorge; Martinez-Cruz, Karla; Peeters, Frank			Methane emissions due to reservoir flushing: a significant emission pathway?	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Reservoirs represent a globally significant source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), which is emitted via different emission pathways. In some reservoirs, reservoir flushing is employed as a sediment management strategy to counteract growing sediment deposits that threaten reservoir capacity. Reservoir flushing utilizes the eroding force of water currents during water level drawdown to mobilize and transport sediment deposits through the dam outlet into the downstream river. During this process, CH4 that is stored in the sediment can be released into the water and degas to the atmosphere, resulting in CH4 emissions. Here, we assess the significance of this CH4 emission pathway and compare it to other CH4 emission pathways from reservoirs. We measured seasonal and spatial CH4 concentrations in the sediment of Schwarzenbach Reservoir, providing one of the largest datasets on CH4 pore water concentrations in freshwater systems. Based on this dataset we determined CH4 fluxes from the sediment and estimated potential CH4 emissions due to reservoir flushing. CH4 emissions due to one flushing operation can constitute 7 %-14 % of the typical annual CH4 emissions from Schwarzenbach Reservoir, whereby the amount of released CH4 depends on the seasonal timing of the flushing operation and can differ by a factor of 2. Larger flushing events that mobilize deeper sediment layers lead to non-linear increases in CH4 mobilization. This suggests that regular flushing of smaller sediment layers releases less CH4 than removal of the same sediment volume in fewer flushing events of thicker sediment layers. However, additional indirect CH4 emissions pathways contributing to the total CH4 emissions may vary with the flushing operation. In other reservoirs with higher sediment loadings than Schwarzenbach Reservoir, reservoir flushing could cause substantial CH4 emissions, especially when flushing operations are conducted frequently. Our study recognizes CH4 emissions due to reservoir flushing as an important pathway, identifies potential management strategies to mitigate these CH4 emissions and emphasizes the need for further research.

Evidence for the production of copper-complexing ligands by marine phytoplankton in the subarctic northeast Pacific	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The availability and toxicity of copper (Cu) to marine phytoplankton involve complexation of Cu by dissolved organic ligands of uncertain origin and structure. As part of a GEOTRACES process study we used immobilized copper(II)-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) to isolate and obtain information about the distribution and potential sources of Cu-complexing ligands along Line P in the subarctic northeast Pacific. Filtered seawater samples were collected from up to five stations during cruises in June 2016, June 2017, August 2017, and September 2018. Copper ligand concentrations were consistently higher at coastal station P4 than at other stations, particularly in surface waters. Ligand concentrations in the upper 40 m at station P26 increased between 2016 and 2018 following the 2014-2016 warming anomaly in the northeast Pacific, whereas an increase in ligand concentration from June to August 2017 coincided with seasonal increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and net community production. At all stations, the depth of highest ligand concentration and maximum chlorophyll concentration coincided. A positive linear correlation between ligand and chlorophyll concentrations suggests that marine phytoplankton are a significant source of Cu ligands along Line P. The lower than expected ligand concentrations at station P26 in June 2016 are consistent with changes in phytoplankton ecology associated with the 2014-2016 warming anomaly. Comparing results from coastal and oceanic waters with those obtained previously in the Canadian Arctic suggests that terrigenous organic matter and marine humic substances contribute to the pool of Cu ligands captured by IMAC.

Zooplankton community structure in relation to microcystins in the eutrophic Lake Zumpango (State of Mexico)	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												We studied the seasonal variation of rotifers, cladocerans and copepods in Lake Zumpango, Mexico City, from June 2010 to May 2011. Physical and chemical variables of the water were measured at three sites, while 50 L of water was filtered from these sites to study the zooplankton abundance, diversity and biomass. The water temperature ranged from 14 to 23 degrees C, and nitrate and phosphate concentrations from 0.2 to 1 and 4 to 14 mg L-1, respectively. Microcystis sp. Dolichospermum sp. and Planktoihrix sp. were present throughout the year. Microcystin concentrations were between 0.06 to 11.7 mu g L-1, but for six months the concentrations exceeded 1 mu g L-1 (1.1 to 11.7 mu g L-1), with the highest concentrations observed in August and October. We recorded 33 species of rotifers, including Brachionus angularis (1 to >11000 ind. L-1), and Brachionus havanaensis (1 to 6683 ind. L-1), while the most abundant cladoceran was Moina micrura (about 10 ind. L-1). The species diversity ranged from 0.8 to 2.9 bits ind(-1), but small (<250 mu m) zooplankton (rotifers and copepod nauplii) dominated the community.

Thus, these macrophytes provide an opportunity to study metal pollution dynamics and the role that macrophytes play in potentially translocating and accumulating these metals. Here, we studied three macrophyte species, namely Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus corymbosus, and Typha capensis, and assessed their potential to be utilized in the phytoremediation of metals in an Austral subtropical river across three seasons. We measured P, K, Ca, Mg, B, Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mn concentrations in macrophyte roots, stems, and leaves, and we further quantified the metal bioconcentration factor (BCF). The N, Ca, and Mg concentrations were generally high in P. australis leaves across all seasons. In general, high Na, Mg, and Ca concentrations were observed in T. capensis across seasons. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) values were generally low (<1) in most macrophyte parts for most metals during the cool-dry season, with the exception of Na, which had high BCF values > 1 (i.e., accumulators) across the different macrophyte parts. We found that P. australis and S. corymbosus have the potential to accumulate metals such as B, Na, Mg, Ca, and N and also have high phytoremediation potential for the studied metals. We found that the studied macrophytes were good at phytoremediation within the river system; however, for any treatment of polluted systems, it is better to use a combination of different macrophytes, as some were better at translocating certain metals than others.

Seasonal dynamics of freshwater pathogens as measured by microarray at Lake Sapanca, a drinking water source in the north-eastern part of Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Monitoring drinking water quality is an important public health issue. Two objectives from the 4 years, six nations, EU Project mu Aqua were to develop hierarchically specific probes to detect and quantify pathogens in drinking water using a PCR-free microarray platform and to design a standardised water sampling program from different sources in Europe to obtain sufficient material for downstream analysis. Our phylochip contains barcodes (probes) that specifically identify freshwater pathogens that are human health risks in a taxonomic hierarchical fashion such that if species is present, the entire taxonomic hierarchy genus, family, order, phylum, kingdom) leading to it must also be present, which avoids false positives. Molecular tools are more rapid, accurate and reliable than traditional methods, which means faster mitigation strategies with less harm to humans and the community. We present microarray results for the presence of freshwater pathogens from a Turkish lake used drinking water and inferred cyanobacterial cell equivalents from samples concentrated from 40 into 1 L in 45 min using hollow fibre filters. In two companion studies from the same samples, cyanobacterial toxins were analysed using chemical methods and those dates with highest toxin values also had highest cell equivalents as inferred from this microarray study.					; , reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; medlin, linda/G-4820-2010; julia, baudart/A-5229-2011; köker, latife/AAB-7634-2020; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020	medlin, linda k/0000-0001-6014-8339; Koker, Latife/0000-0002-9134-2801; Baudart, Julia/0000-0003-3372-7874; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2018	190	1							42	10.1007/s10661-017-6314-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6314-7								29273852					WOS:000422680800001

Heterogeneity in food-web interactions of fish in the Mwanza Gulf, Lake Victoria: a quantitative stable isotope study	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Stable isotope analyses and derived population-level metrics were used to quantitatively analyse spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in the fish trophic dynamics in relation to environmental variables in Mwanza Gulf, Lake Victoria (Tanzania). The fish community in Lake Victoria, including the top predator Nile perch, is generally omnivorous with a heavy reliance on invertebrates. This is in contrast to findings based on stomach content analyses of Nile perch, which showed a stronger reliance on fish. We tested two hypotheses: (1) during the rainy seasons multiple carbon sources influence the food-web structure inside the Gulf, leading to increased carbon ranges and trophic diversity. (2) During dry periods, the food-web structure mainly relies on pelagic primary production, reducing carbon ranges and trophic diversity. Carbon sources indeed varied seasonally and spatially, affecting the fish community at the highest trophic levels. With the onset of rains, carbon sources became spatially highly differentiated with enriched delta C-13 values of fish in shallow water inside the Gulf and depleted delta C-13 values in open waters. Metrics associated with niche size correlated significantly with seasonally varying environmental variables, while delta C-13 ranges correlated with spatially varying environmental variables.

Lake water is of the bicarbonate type, and there are no major pollutants. delta O-18-delta D-water values plot on a local evaporation line (delta D=5.29 delta O-18-12.29) indicating that evaporative enrichment had a significant impact on lake water isotopic features. Periods of high water levels are characterized by lower delta S-34-delta O-18(dissolved-sulphate) and delta C-13(dissolved-inorganic-carbon) values and suggest sulphate derived from weathering of sulphides in the catchment area, delivered to the lake by surface run-off or via groundwater, and in situ decay of organic matter. During lower water levels, sulphate reduction and enhanced primary productivity lead to higher delta S-34(dissolved-sulphate) and delta C-13(dissolved-inorganic-carbon) values. Evaporation induced enrichment in O-18(sulphate), C-13(dissolved-inorganic-carbon) and C-13-O-18(shells-Galba-Gyraulus). delta C-13(plant) confirms the C3 photosynthetic pathway. Enrichment in C-13 submerged aquatic plants indicates that HCO3- is the main carbon source, except for C-13-depleted Potamogeton. The TOC, delta C-13(org) values, and TC/TN ratios in sediments all confirm the autochthonous character of organic matter contribution. This study provides a baseline for isotopic research into shallow, flow-through lakes fed by siliciclastic aquifers, and stresses the importance of evaporation and refilling (direct precipitation and groundwater discharge) in controlling the solute chemistry and stable isotopic composition in temperate regions with contrasting seasonal climates. The results also provide a snapshot of modern lake isotope variability that can be applied to paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

Trophic state and nutrient limitation in Lake Baringo, Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The trophic state of Lake Baringo and factors that could be limiting the development of algal biomass in it were investigated during one wet/dry hydrological cycle in 2014-2015. Water samples were analysed for dissolved inorganic nutrients, including NH4+, NO2- and NO3-, total phosphorus and Chlorophyll a. Light attenuation was estimated using Secchi depth. The trophic state was determined using Carlson trophic state indices (CTSI). Deviations in CTSI, nutrient ratios and ambient nutrient concentrations were used to identify factors limiting phytoplankton growth. The mean values measured for Secchi depth, nitrate, total phosphorus and Chlorophyll a showed significant seasonal variation (p < 0.05). Based on the Carlson trophic state index, the results show that Lake Baringo is eutrophic. However, the lake is also experiencing phosphorus limitation and poor light penetration, because of high turbidity, which is more pronounced during the wet season.																			1608-5914	1727-9364					2018	43	2					169	173		10.2989/16085914.2018.1462139	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2018.1462139													WOS:000445305300009

A glimpse into the littoral nutrient dynamics of a lake system connected to the sea	WATER SA												In South Africa more than 80% of estuaries are small, dynamic and predominantly linear systems. Nutrient characteristics in these systems are mostly influenced by external catchment processes, except during extended periods of closure. However, a small percentage of the country's estuaries (< 3%) comprise larger estuarine lakes mostly evolved from drowned river valleys. The physical properties of these systems suggest relatively low flushing rates, and the potentially stronger influence of in-situ processes on nutrient characteristics. This study investigates dissolved inorganic nutrient dynamics in the littoral zones of these estuarine lake systems, and potential influencing factors, using the Wilderness Lake System as a case study. Comparison of inter-annual and seasonal trends in dissolved inorganic nutrients (NOx-N, NH4-N and PO4-P) in river inflow and in the three lakes confirmed that external catchment fluxes are most likely not the sole, or even the dominant drivers of average long-term or seasonal dissolved inorganic nutrient patterns in the lake littoral zones. Relatively low NOx:NH4 ratios (mostly less than 1) in the lakes (especially in Eilandvlei and Langvlei) indicated a stronger influence of in-situ processes, such as bacteriological remineralisation, similar to observations in other lake type systems with low flushing rates. Low NO3:NH4 ratios are known to stimulate cyanobacteria, having the metabolic ability to potentially produce microcystins. Therefore, incremental dissolved inorganic nutrient and organic matter enrichment may cause these systems to tip into eutrophic, possibly toxic, aquatic states that will be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse given their weak flushing mechanisms. The findings from this study highlight the importance of appropriate water resource management, both in the catchments and within the floodplains of estuarine lake systems.					van Niekerk, Lara/AAG-8064-2021; Taljaard, Susan/AAP-9114-2021; Lemley, Daniel/J-1328-2019	Lemley, Daniel Alan/0000-0003-0325-8499; Van Niekerk, Lara/0000-0001-5761-1337; 													0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2018	44	1					65	74		10.4314/wsa.v44i1.08	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v44i1.08													WOS:000426764300008

Polyandry Is a Common Event in Wild Populations of the Tsetse Fly Glossina fuscipes fuscipes and May Impact Population Reduction Measures	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES												Background: Glossina fuscipes fuscipes is the main vector of human and animal trypanosomiasis in Africa, particularly in Uganda. Attempts to control/eradicate this species using biological methods require knowledge of its reproductive biology. An important aspect is the number of times a female mates in the wild as this influences the effective population size and may constitute a critical factor in determining the success of control methods. To date, polyandry in G.f. fuscipes has not been investigated in the laboratory or in the wild. Interest in assessing the presence of remating in Ugandan populations is driven by the fact that eradication of this species is at the planning stage in this country. Methodology/Principal Findings: Two well established populations, Kabukanga in the West and Buvuma Island in Lake Victoria, were sampled to assess the presence and frequency of female remating. Six informative microsatellite loci were used to estimate the number of matings per female by genotyping sperm preserved in the female spermathecae. The direct count of the minimum number of males that transferred sperm to the spermathecae was compared to Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian probability estimates. The three estimates provided evidence that remating is common in the populations but the frequency is substantially different: 57% in Kabukanga and 33% in Buvuma. Conclusions/Significance: The presence of remating, with females maintaining sperm from different mates, may constitute a critical factor in cases of re-infestation of cleared areas and/or of residual populations. Remating may enhance the reproductive potential of re-invading propagules in terms of their effective population size. We suggest that population age structure may influence remating frequency. Considering the seasonal demographic changes that this fly undergoes during the dry and wet seasons, control programmes based on SIT should release large numbers of sterile males, even in residual surviving target populations, in the dry season.

Carbon cycling in Lake Erie during cultural eutrophication over the last century inferred from the stable carbon isotope composition of sediments	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A similar to 106-cm sediment core from the eastern basin of Lake Erie was examined to investigate biogeochemical processes in this large lake during its cultural eutrophication over the last century. We measured stable carbon isotopes of total organic carbon and calcium carbonate (delta C-13(TOC) and delta C-13(CaCO3)) as well as the concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3). delta C-13(TOC) and TOC show a strong positive correlation throughout the core and record changes in phytoplankton productivity and nutrient loading. CaCO3 and TOC concentrations display a negative correlation throughout the core, suggesting that CaCO3 concentrations are controlled primarily by decomposition of TOC in the hypolimnion and the sediments, although temperature and invasive mussels are also potential controlling factors. delta C-13(CaCO3) values show a positive correlation with delta C-13(TOC) between 1909 and 1969, indicating phytoplankton productivity was the primary control for delta C-13(CaCO3) values during eutrophication. However, a negative correlation between delta C-13(CaCO3) and delta C-13(TOC) from 1970 to 2002 suggests that these two proxies tracked different aspects of the carbon cycle in the lake in more recent times. The cause for the negative correlation is not yet known, but it is perhaps associated with temperature variations and seasonal differences in productivity.

The magnitudes and rates-of-change in diatom and chironomid assemblages were numerically estimated. Instrumental climate records were used to assess statistically the amount of variance in diatom and chironomid data explained by temperature. August and September air temperatures have a statistically signi. cant effect on diatom composition at both lakes. At Mitrofanovskoe Lake, major compositional changes in diatom and chironomid assemblages occurred at the turn of the 20th century and might be related to the regional increase in temperature. Chironomidinferred air temperature also increased by approximately 1 degrees C since the early 1900s. At both lakes diatom compositional changes, coincident with the increase in June and September temperatures, also occurred in the late 1960s. These compositional changes are correlated with the increase in diatom production, sediment organic content and diatom species richness, and are likely to be a diatom response to the lengthening of the growing season. These changes are also correlated with the circum- Arctic temperature increase from the 1960s. A chironomid response to the late 1960s temperature increase was less pronounced at both lakes. Pollution levels are relatively low and pollution history is unrelated to ecological changes. Both lead isotopes and spheroidal carbonaceous particles show a clear atmospheric pollution signal, peaking in the 1980s.

J	Miguel, LLAJ; Nehama, FPJ; Castro, JWA				Antonio Jimo Miguel, Lucas Lavo; Juma Nehama, Fialho Paloge; Alencar Castro, Joao Wagner			Lagoon-barrier system response to recent climate conditions and sea level rise, Mozambique, Africa	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE					7th European Coastal Lagoons Symposium	MAR 01-04, 2016	Murcia, SPAIN	Univ Murcia, Campus Mare Nostrum, Fundac Seneca, Reg Murcia				Transitioning lagoon-barrier systems and coastal transgressive dunes offer the valuable opportunity to correlate their formation and interactions with seasonal dry and wet climate conditions, stepped relative sea-level rise of similar to 3.5 m, and sediment supply at various scales. This manuscript examines the Holocene sea level changes and recent climate conditions and controls on a 150 m-high coastal barrier system in Mozambique, southeastern Africa. The methodological approach was based on the use of 7 kyr B.P. relative sea-level curve; 37 years of wind records from 1979 to 2016; 52 years of rainfall records from 1960 to 2012; and 56 years of average recorded temperatures from 1960 to 2016. Local dunefield migrations were monitored and the sand transport rate was measured from 2016 to 2017. The combined effects of the relative sea-level rise and sediment supply indicate the formation of the lagoon-barrier system in southern Mozambique. While the recent dry and wet climate conditions suggest that they might be a controlling factor on the generation of transgressive dunefields that migrate landward. This migration is reflected on the sand transport rate of 1.4 kg m(-1) s(-1), which is controlled by winds from the SSW, the S and the SSE quadrants. The active parabolic dunes monitored, indicated a SE-NW migration rate of 22.5 m yr(-1), which rapidly buries lakes and lagoons systems. The formation of different geomorphological features on the transgressive paleodunes and modern dunes reflect their exposure to prevailing S, SSE, SE, E and N winds, the annual rainfall of 1600 mm yr(-1), and the absence of rain for 7 months yr(-1). The stepped Holocene sea-level changes combined with high sediment supply and persistent acting of seasonal dry and wet climatic conditions led on the sedimentation and definition of transgressive dunefields morphology in southern Mozambique coast.

Distribution and characteristics of dissolved organic matter in mangrove sediment pore waters along the coastline of French Guiana	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Mangroves represent a major environment of tropical coasts. They are highly productive, and act both as a source and a sink of organic carbon. Concentrations and characteristics (fluorescence and hydrophobic-hydrophilic fractions) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in relation to the organic content of sediments and to the chemistry of pore waters along the coastline of French Guiana. The pore waters studied were extracted (centrifugation, soil moisture sampler) from sediments cored beneath A. germinans mangrove stands representative of development stages: pioneer, mature and senescent. In order to asses the effects of seasonal changes, two cores were performed in each location, just after dry and wet seasons, respectively. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in pore waters of the upper sediment were found to increase, from 0.7 mmol l(-1) under the pioneers to 9 under senescent mangroves. The evolution of sedimentary organic carbon (SedOC) in the same sediment paralleled that of DOC, increasing from 0.7 to 28%. On the contrary, in the lower parts of sediment cores SedOC and DOC displayed contrasting vertical trends: SedOC decreased sharply with depth while DOC increased, reaching concentrations up to 30 mmol l(-1) stop at 50 cm in the older, senescent mangroves. In addition, the Fluorescence/DOC ratios and the hydrophobic contents of DOC were higher at greater depths in most cores, expressing changes in the DOC composition. These results suggest that the DOC of the upper layers originated directly from the SedOC of the enclosing sediment, while the hydrophobic and fluorescent DOC accumulated in the anoxic bottom layer. The mechanisms responsible for this accumulation at depth requires additional research to be fully understood. However, the anoxic conditions and high pH values prevailing in the lower sediment, by lessening DOM sorption and enhancing SedOC dissolution, may be partly responsible for the high DOC concentrations and fluorescences at depth. In addition, seasonal variation may be involved. During the rainy season, water sources were mixed resulting in lower DOC concentrations in the upper sediment, whereas during the dry season, increased evapotranspiration concentrate salts and DOC, which are transported vertically with percolating water.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				OCT	2006	81	1					59	75		10.1007/s10533-006-9030-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-006-9030-x													WOS:000240980500005

Interconnectedness during high water maintains similarity in fish assemblages of island floodplain lakes in the Amazonian Basin	ZOOLOGIA												We conducted a study to test the hypothesis that interconnectedness among island floodplain lakes and the adjacent Solimoes River during the flood stage of the hydrologic cycle is enough to maintain similarity in fish species assemblages. Gill net samples were collected during high and low water periods for three consecutive years (July 2004 to July 2006) in four lakes on Paciencia Island. Two lakes, Piranha and Ressaca, are connected to the river all year, and the other two, Preto and Cacau, which are in the center of the island, are isolated during low water periods. The abundance, species richness and evenness of the fish assemblages in these lakes did not differ according to their relative positions or the season of the hydrological cycle, which confirmed our hypothesis. However, fish abundance during the dry season was greater than in the flood season. Apparently, the short period of full connection between the lakes is enough to allow the colonization of all fish species, but not to cause similar abundances. Our study indicates that persistence of the species composition of island floodplain lakes is primarily due to the annual replenishment of fish to the lakes during the flood season.

Going with the Flow: Legionellosis Risk in Toronto, Canada Is Strongly Associated with Local Watershed Hydrology	ECOHEALTH												Legionella species are increasingly recognized as a cause of both healthcare- and community-acquired pneumonia (so-called "Legionnaire's disease"). These pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment, but environmental factors in the occurrence of sporadic legionellosis remain poorly understood. We analyzed all legionellosis cases identified in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario from 1978 to 2006, and evaluated seasonal and environmental patterns in legionellosis case occurrence by using both negative binomial models and case-crossover analysis. A total of 837 cases were reported during the study period. After adjusting for seasonal effects, changes in the local watershed, rather than weather, were the strongest contributors to legionellosis risk. A 3.6-fold increase (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4-5.3) in odds of disease was identified with decreasing watershed levels approximately 4 weeks before case-occurrence. We also found a 33% increase (95% CI, 8-64%) in odds of disease with decreasing lake temperature during the same period and a 34% increase (95% CI, 14-57%) with increasing humidity 5 weeks before case-occurrence. We conclude that local watershed ecology influences the risk of legionellosis, notwithstanding the availability of advanced water treatment capacity in Toronto. Enhancement of risk might occur through direct contamination of water sources or via introduction of micronutrients or commensal organisms into residential and hospital water supplies. These observations suggest testable hypotheses for future empiric studies.

They provide plant refugia, and commonly host species that would otherwise not thrive on the grassy uplands. Farmers sometimes make use of lavaka to plant crops that require more protection or soil moisture. Colonial narratives blame lavaka erosion on poor land management but ignore their pre-human-settlement existence on the landscape and the ecological functions they serve. The knowledge and wisdom of Malagasy farmers are key to better understanding the complex roles that lavaka plays in the landscape.SummaryThis paper combines a review of lavaka-erosional gullies in Madagascar's grass-covered highlands-with new observations of their importance as ecological patch environments for a wide range of plants not seen elsewhere within the grassy biome. Lavaka play a role as a natural refugia for flora that would otherwise not thrive on the exposed and infertile hillslopes, and local farmers exploit their topography and sediment deposits to grow a variety of crops. We provide a classification scheme for lavaka based on the extent to which they have been colonised by vegetation. Our analysis is based on observations made over many field seasons in the highlands as well as interviews with Malagasy farmers living with lavaka on their land. We emphasise the importance of local knowledge and environmental wisdom in the analysis of landscape evolution, and we conclude that lavaka, while certainly an erosional problem in many places, can nonetheless provide valuable ecosystem services and agricultural opportunities that should not be overlooked. Erosion of lavaka, large gullies in Madagascar, can cause problems, but these features also have beneficial aspects. They provide plant refugia and commonly host species that would otherwise not thrive on the grassy uplands. Farmers sometimes make use of lavaka to plant crops that require more protection or soil moisture. Colonial narratives blame lavaka erosion on poor land management but ignore their pre-human-settlement existence on the landscape and the ecological functions they serve. The knowledge and wisdom of Malagasy farmers are key to better understanding the complex roles that lavaka plays in the landscape.image					; Cox, Ronadh/W-2708-2019	, Alize Carrere/0009-0008-6668-1802; Cox, Ronadh/0000-0002-1743-2702; 														2572-2611				MAR	2024	6	2					287	303		10.1002/ppp3.10440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.10440		SEP 2023											WOS:001071557900001

Environmental factors associated with genetic and phenotypic divergence among sympatric populations of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												The mechanisms by which phenotypic and genetic divergence may occur among sympatric, conspecific populations have been widely discussed but are still not well understood. Possible mechanisms include assortative mating based on morphology or variation in the reproductive behaviour of phenotypes, and both have been suggested to be relevant to the differentiation of salmonid populations in post-glacial lakes. Here, we studied Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in Windermere, where putative populations are defined by spatial and temporal variation in spawning. Genetic differentiation was assessed based on nine microsatellite loci, and phenotypic variation was assessed from morphometric characters. We test hypotheses about the relative role of morphology, spawning season and spawning habitat in the evolution of genetic divergence among these populations. Distinct from other lake systems, we find that both morphological and genetic differentiation are restricted primarily to one of two interconnecting basins, that genetic and morphological differentiation are decoupled in this lake and that both phenotype and environment have changed over the last 20 years. The implication is that breeding habitat plays a primary role in isolating populations that differentiate by drift and that phenotypically plastic changes, potentially related to foraging specializations, have either become secondarily decoupled from the genetically defined populations or were never fundamental in driving the evolution of genetic diversity in the Windermere system.

Recognizing the Kacak Event in the Devonian terrestrial environment and its implications for understanding land-sea interactions	DEVONIAN EVENTS AND CORRELATIONS	Geological Society Special Publication											The Kacak Event is a late Eifelian (Mid-Devonian) episode of marine dysoxia/anoxia with associated extinctions. It has been widely recognized in the shelf seas that surrounded the Old Red Sandstone continent. It was contemporary with the lacustrine Orcadian Basin in Scotland. This basin contains the distinctive Achanarras lake horizon that contains a rich and diverse fish fauna. The Achanarras lake was wide and deep and would have been filled by rainfall from a monsoon system at an insolation maximum. Faunal elements within the lake are in common with the Kernave. Member in Estonia and this level can be conodont dated as late Eifelian eiflius or ensensis Zone. Therefore the group of lacustrine flooding climatic events that occur at and above the Achanarras level can be correlated with the marine Kacak Event (sensu lato) and both can be regarded as having a common climatic cause and driven by an insolation maximum. A reconstruction of the Orcadian Basin drainage system and a water balance model based on the calcium flux within the lake shows that a very significant volume of water would have been seasonally discharged to the Rheic Ocean and would have caused an additional environmental effect.

Microcystins were determined by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrum. Microcystin (MC-RR + MC-YR + MC-LR) content of the offspring and gonad showed high positive correlation, indicating that microcystins could transfer from adult females to their young with physiological connection. This study is the first to report the presence of microcystins in the offspring of the adult snail. The majority of the toxins were present in the intestine (53.6%) and hepatopancreas (29.9%), whereas other tissues contained only 16.5%. If intestines are excluded, up to 64.3% of the toxin burden was allocated in the hepatopancreas. The microcystin content in the intestine, hepatopancreas, and gonad were correlated with the biomass of Microcystis and intracellular and extracellular toxins. Of the analyzed foot samples, 18.2% were above the tolerable daily microcystin intake recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for human consumption. This result indicates that public health warnings regarding human ingestion of snails from Taihu Lake are warranted. In addition, further studies are needed to evaluate the occurrence by Microcystis in relation to spatial and temporal changes in water quality.

J	Saaroni, H; Ziv, B				Saaroni, H; Ziv, B			The impact of a small lake on heat stress in a Mediterranean urban park: the case of Tel Aviv, Israel	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Field observations of air and surface temperatures, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind were performed in the daytime hours of the warm season around a pond of 4 ha, located in Begin Park, in the city of Tel Aviv, Israel. Observations were carried out at screened meteorological stations on four randomly selected days, all associated with moderate heat stress. Two of them, one representing a warm and dry day, and other, representing a sultry day, are analyzed in detail. At the downwind side of the pond, lower temperatures, a higher relative humidity and a lower heat stress index were observed consistently when compared with stations located upwind of the pond. This effect is regarded here as the "lake effect". The fact that no significant change was noted in the water vapor pressure during most of the daytime hours indicates that the lake effect was related mainly to cooling rather than to moisture transport from the pond. A positive relationship was found between the lake effect and wind speed in both types of weather. The maximum effect of the wind's speed on the lake effect was observed at midday, at which time the temperature drop reached 1.6 degreesC, while the relative humidity rose by 6%. As a result, the heat stress index dropped by 0.8-1.1 degreesC. It is suggested that the temperature drop induced by the pond during the warmest hours of the day was mainly the result of a truncation of the sensible heat flux from the underlying surface when the air, which had previously passed over hot surfaces, swept over the relatively cool water. During the late afternoon and evening hours, when the water became warmer than the surrounding surfaces, latent heat cooling resulting from evaporation became the dominant source of the lake effect, and the lake effect resulted in increasing heat stress. It is concluded that even small bodies of water have a relieving effect on humans in the daytime hours, within the range of 40 m, under both dry and humid hot weather conditions.																			0020-7128					MAY	2003	47	3					156	165		10.1007/s00484-003-0161-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-003-0161-7								12748843					WOS:000183541000005

Mitchell			Weather Conditions Conducive for the Early-Season Production and Dispersal of Cercospora beticola Spores in the Great Lakes Region of North America	PLANT DISEASE												In many parts of the world including the Great Lakes region of North America, Cercospora leaf spot (CLS), caused by the fungal pathogen Cercospora beticola, is a major foliar disease of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). Management of CLS involves an integrated approach which includes the application of fungicides. To guide fungicide application timings, disease prediction models are widely used by sugar beet growers in North America. While these models have generally worked well, they have not included information about pathogen presence. Thus, incorporating spore production and dispersal could make them more effective. The current study used sentinel beets to assess the presence of C. beticola spores in the environment early in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. Weather variables including air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, leaf wetness, wind speed, and solar radiation were collected. These data were used to identify environmental variables that correlated with spore levels during a time when CLS is not generally observed in commercial fields. C. beticola spores were detected during mid-April both years, which is much earlier than previously reported. A correlation was found between spore data and all the weather variables examined during at least one of the two years, except for air temperature. In both years, spore presence was significantly correlated with rainfall (P < 0.0001) as well as relative humidity (P < 0.0090). Rainfall was particularly intriguing, with an adjusted R-2 of 0.3135 in 2017 and 0.1652 in 2018. Efforts are ongoing to investigate information on spore presence to improve prediction models and CLS management.

We used Landsat satellite imagery to observe temporal and spatial changes in open-water habitats in Zhengzhou, a rapidly growing city in central China. We classified open water into six categories: perennial rivers, seasonal rivers and streams, canals, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. From 1990 to 2020, in 5-year intervals, we identified, counted, and measured the area of each kind of waterbody, and we used a model selection approach with linear regressions to ask which climate and anthropogenic drivers were associated with these changes. We also used Conefor software to examine how these changes affected the landscape connectivity for waterfowl. Over the study period, lakes and canals were the only waterbody types to show statistically significant changes in surface area, increasing by 712% and 236%, respectively. Changes in lakes and canals were positively correlated with the length of water pipeline in the city. The connectivity of waterbodies fluctuated over the same period, mirroring fluctuations in the perennial Yellow River. Ponds contributed very little to landscape connectivity, and the importance of reservoirs decreased over time. Conversely, canals played an increasingly important role in landscape connectivity over time. Counterintuitively, the connectivity of waterbodies increased in the built-up part of the city. Our results show that urbanization can have unexpected effects-both positive and negative-on the connectivity and area of open-water habitats. These effects are likely to be important for waterfowl and other aquatic organisms.

In this study, we investigated lined seahorses Hippocampus erectus by season, size, and sex across a tidal lake on the island of Eleuthera (The Bahamas). In total, 35 benthic transects of 30-60 m(2) were established around the lake margin and assessed 4 times between 2014 and 2016. Seahorses were mapped along each transect and photographed for morphological analyses. Mean (+/- SE) landscape-level seahorse density was 0.14 +/- 0.013 ind. m(-2) (max. 0.66 ind. m(-2) ), which was substantially higher than worldwide seahorse mean density. Local seahorse density differed both seasonally and spatially, 40% higher in the wet than dry season, and 48.8% lower in the south than in the north end of the lake. Sex-ratio was significantly male-biased in both the north end of the lake and during the wet months. Male mating effort varied seasonally and spatially, with a significantly higher frequency of gravid males in the dry season and the north end of the lake. Male seahorses were significantly larger than females, with additional morphological traits that indicate broader sexual dimorphism. Compared to other seahorse species, Sweetings Pond animals have a higher population density, smaller size at maturity, and a different shape than other H. erectus, indicating a population that is a discrete management unit. Given the CITES Appendix II listing of all seahorses and their decreasing numbers worldwide, this population represents a valuable biological resource that should be managed uniquely.

Nitrogen dynamics in large shallow eutrophic Lake Chaohu, China	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Temporal and spatial dynamics of nitrogen in lake and interstitial water were studied monthly in a large shallow, eutrophic lake in subtropical China from October 2002 to September 2003. The distribution of nitrogen was consistent with the idea that high nitrogen concentrations in the western part of the lake resulted from high levels of the nutrients from the surrounding cities through sewage-drainage systems. Nitrate was the predominant form of nitrogen in the overlying water, while ammonium was predominant in the interstitial water, indicating that strong oxidative nutrient regeneration occurred near the sediment-water interface. Nitrate could be an important dissolved inorganic matter source for phytoplankton, which in turn influenced the seasonal variations of nitrate concentrations in lake water. Significant positive correlation between ammonium fluxes and water temperature was observed and could probably be attributed to the intensified ammonification and nitrate reduction with increased temperature. Positive correlation between ammonium fluxes and algae biomass and Chl a concentrations may indicate that phytoplankton was an important factor driving ammonium fluxes in our study lake, and vice versa that higher fluxes of ammonium supported a higher biomass of the phytoplankton.

This study aims at modeling the hydro-sedimentary functioning of Lake Taabo in order to understand the sedimentation phenomena taking place. In this survey, 204 water samples and 31 bottom sediment samples were taken, during different hydrological seasons, to estimate suspended sediment concentrations and characterize the bottom sediments of Lake Taabo. The study showed that suspended solid variations are related to hydrological seasons. During dry seasons, the lake is lightly loaded; the average concentration is 7.89 mg/L. At the other end of the scale, during rainy seasons, suspended sediment concentrations increase and the average concentration is around 16.30 mg/L. The bottom of the reservoir mostly consists of mud. Sands are found near the islands and the dam. Sand size varies from medium grain to coarse. The average grain size is 451.48 mu m. The hydro-sedimentary environment of Lake Taabo was simulated by a transport model, coupled with a hydrodynamic model. The various simulation scenarios indicated that Lake Taabo is subject to 20 to 60 mm of annual deposits. The greater thicknesses were observed near the spillway and the power intake.

Assessment of the radiological impact of gamma and radon dose rates at former U mining sites in Kyrgyzstan	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												An assessment of the radiological situation due to exposure to gamma radiation, radon and thoron was carried out at the former uranium mining and processing sites in Shekaftar, Minkush and Kadji Sai in Kyrgyzstan. Gamma dose rate measurements were made using various field instruments and radon/thoron measurements were carried out using discriminative radon (Rn-222)/thoron (Rn-220) solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD). The detectors were exposed for an extended period of time including at least three seasonal periods in a year, in different outdoor and indoor public and residential environments at the selected uranium legacy sites. The results showed that gamma, Rn and Tn doses were in general low, which consequently implies a low/relatively low radiological risk. The major radiation hazard is represented by abandoned radioactive filtration material that was being used as insulation by some Minkush residents for a longer period of time. Annual radiation doses of several hundred mSv could be received as a consequence of using this material in their houses. The radiation doses deriving from external radiation (gamma dose rate), indoor radon and thoron with their short-lived progenies in several cases exceeded national as well as international standards. Current doses of ionizing radiation do not represent any serious hazard to the health of the resident public, but this issue should be adequately addressed to further reduce needless exposure of resident public to ionizing radiation.

Structures and facies associated with the flow of subaerial basaltic lava into a deep freshwater lake: The Sulphur Creek lava flow, North Cascades, Washington	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The ca. 8800 C-14 yrs BP Sulphur Creek lava flowed eastward 12 km from the Schriebers Meadow cinder cone into the Baker River valley, on the southeast flank of Mount Baker volcano. The compositionally-zoned basaltic to basaltic andesite lava entered, crossed and partially filled the 2-km-wide and >100-m-deep early Holocene remnant of Glacial Lake Baker. The valley is now submerged beneath a reservoir, but seasonal drawdown permits study of the distal entrant lava. As a lava volume that may have been as much as 180 x 10(6) m(3) entered the lake, the flow invaded the lacustrine sequence and extended to the opposite (east) side of the drowned Baker River valley. The volume and mobility of the lava can be attributed to a high flux rate, a prolonged eruption, or both. Basalt exposed below the former level of the remnant glacial lake is glassy or microcrystalline and sparsely vesicular, with pervasive hackly or blocky fractures. Together with pseudopillow fractures, these features reflect fracturing normal to penetrative thermal fronts and quenching by water. A fine-grained hyaloclastite facies was probably formed during quench fragmentation or isolated magma-water explosions. Although the structures closely resemble those developed in lava-ice contact environments, establishing the depositional environment for lava exhibiting similar intense fracturing should be confirmed by geologic evidence rather than by internal structure alone. The lava also invaded the lacustrine sequence, forming varieties of peperite, including sills that are conformable within the invaded strata and resemble volcaniclastic breccias. The peperite is generally fragmental and clast- or matrix-supported; fine-grained and rounded fluidal margins occur locally. The lava formed a thickened subaqueous plug that, as the lake drained in the mid-Holocene, was exposed to erosion. The Baker River then cut a 52-m-deep gorge through the shattered, highly erodible basalt. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Recent increases in hydropower dams along the Mekong River have likely altered the surface water hydrology impacting the arable areas and soil qualities for rice production in the Tonle Sap lowland. Along with the hydrological impacts, the region's rice farming is facing a rapidly changing climate. It is critical to understand how the hydrological changes associated with dam development impact the region's rice production in a changing climate. The aims of this study were to assess the impacts of recent increases in hydropower dams on the timing and areas of rice cropping in the Tonle Sap floodplains and to evaluate the effects of changing hydrology, rising temperature, and adaptive farming practices on rice productivity using a process-based rice crop model: ORYZA (v3). The effect of dams on arable areas for rice was identified by a remote-sensing method based on the PhenoRice algorithm for the period of 2001-2019 in two rice-growing provinces: Kampong Thom and Battambang. The PhenoRice method identified an increase in rice growing areas as well as shifts in both timing and location of rice cropping towards the sources of irrigation during the dry season since 2010. The ORYZA model simulated a substantial yield reduction with an increase of 2 degrees C in air temperature in the region. The model predicted that the rice productivity in the region is sensitive to soil organic carbon content which is expected to change with surface water hydrology. The model also predicted that region's rice yield can increase by optimizing the timing and amount of N fertilization. The findings from this study highlight how hydrology, climate, and agronomic practices can interact to impact rice production in the Lower Mekong Region and provide insights for effective water management and agronomic practices to attain food security in the region in a changing climate.					; Kim, Soo-Hyung/A-3012-2009; Holtgrieve, Gordon/C-5371-2009; Marcaida, Manuel/HGC-6363-2022	Neumann, Rebecca B/0000-0003-3464-9046; Kim, Soo-Hyung/0000-0003-3879-4080; Farhat, Yasmine/0009-0000-9669-3005; Marcaida, Manuel/0000-0002-4954-6704; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				DEC 1	2021	258								107183	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107183		SEP 2021											WOS:000701950900009

In the phytoplankton communities, a diatom Aulacoseira granulata dominated throughout the lake in the high-water seasons, while blue-green algae, mostly composed of Microcystis, surpassed other algae in the low-water season when the lake water was very turbid and the Secchi disk readings were only a few centimeters. In the low-water seasons, a bloom of floating blue-green algae occurred everywhere, especially prominent in the coastal areas. Protozoans and rotifers dominated the zooplankton communities. In the open-water stations, diversity was higher in high-water seasons in phytoplankton, while it was not significantly different between seasons in zooplankton. Composition of plankton communities in Lake Tonle Sap appears to have changed little since the 1950s, at least in phytoplankton, while the phytoplankton density appears to be higher in the present study. Among the macrozoobenthos, mollusks, oligochaetes and chironomids dominated in density, and mollusks exceeded others in biomass in both basins and seasons. The total densities of macrozobenthos were not high, being fewer than 1,300 m(-2) throughout the stations and seasons. Possible reasons for the low zoobenthos abundance in the lake may include high predation pressures by benthivorous fish or unfavorable unstable and flocculant substrates.

The hydrodynamic model was driven by employing observed winds and daily measured flow data to simulate the seasonal water cycle of the reservoir. The simulation of the mass transport and transformation processes of CODMn TN and TP was based on the unsteady diffusion equations, driven by observed meteorological forcing and external loadings, with the fluxes form the bottom of reservoir and the plant photosynthesis and respiration as internal Sources and sinks. A finite volume method and Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) scheme were used to solve these equations. The model was calibrated and verified by using the data observed from YQR in two different years. The results showed that in YQR, the wind-driven current was an important style of lake current, while the concentration of water quality item was decreasing from east to west because of the external pollutant loadings. There was a good agreement between the Simulated and measured values, with the minimal calculation error percent of 0.1% and 2.6% and the mean error percent of 44.0% and 51.2% for TN and TP separately. The simulation also showed that, in YQR, the convection was the main process in estuaries of inflow river, and diffusion and biochemical processes dominate in center of reservoir. So it was necessary to build a pre-pond to reduce the external loadings into the reservoir.

Estimated IRs in Lake Pavin (mean = 0.4 viruses HNF-1 h(-1), CV = 38.0%) and in Lake Aydat (mean = 0.3 viruses HNF-1 h(-1), CV = 35.6%) were not significantly different, in contrast to clearance rates (CR), which were significantly higher in the oligomesotrophic (2.3 x 10(-2) nI HNF-1 h(-1)) than in the eutrophic lake (0.7 x 10(-2) nI HNF-1 h(-1)). CRs for viruses were correlated with CRs for bacteria in Lake Aydat but not in Lake Pavin, suggesting a greater abundance within the HNF assemblages of virus-sized particle feeders in the less productive lake. We estimated that 4.1 and 0.8% of viral production were grazed by HNF in Lake Pavin and Lake Aydat, respectively. Finally, although viruses seem to represent a minor food source for HNF (i.e. compared to bacteria), they may not be inconsequential in their diet, especially in oligotrophic lakes.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Bettarel, Yvan/L-2691-2017	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													0948-3055	1616-1564				MAY 30	2005	39	2					205	209		10.3354/ame039205	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame039205													WOS:000229867200009

Determination of water quality in this study consisted of trophic status determination based on total phosphorus, total nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate), and water clarity. Data were obtained 4 times a year for 16 years (1999-2013). We determined the overall water quality status by comparing data with criteria specified in Ministerial Regulation (Permen) of the Environment Number 28 of 2009 on the Water Pollution Load Capacity of Lakes or Reservoirs. Data from 11 stations were analyzed, which indicated a hypertrophic state with very high pollution. Nanjung Post (upstream of the reservoir) had the highest levels of total P, total N, and chlorophyll a compared with the Muara Ciminyak Post and Muara Intake Post (the middle and downstream regions of the reservoir). Seasonal changes had no effect on the trophic status, regardless of dry, normal, or wet conditions.

Using data from a total of 90 historical and recent surveys in nine regulated and eight unregulated alpine and subalpine lakes, we show an additional large effect of reservoirs, i.e., that impoundment causes drastically decreased fish growth and thereby great negative consequences for inland fisheries in Scandinavia. Following a long period (40-65 years) after impoundment, the length and mass of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) of the single age class 4+ years was, on average, 35% and 72% lower, respectively, in impounded versus natural lakes in northern Scandinavia. The effect was stronger at higher altitudes and can be mitigated by addition of inorganic nutrients. We suggest that the decreased fish growth is a consequence of lowered ecosystem productivity, oligotrophication, caused by impoundment, resulting in erosion and loss of the littoral ecosystem as well as delayed flooding and leakage of nutrients from the riparian zone until after the growing season.

J	Sharma, A				Sharma, A			Seasonal to interannual rainfall probabilistic forecasts for improved water supply management: Part 1 - A strategy for system predictor identification	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Effective use of available water resources is a serious problem facing the world as it enters the 21st century. An important source of concern to water resources managers is the occurrence of severe and sustained droughts that deplete reservoir storage to dangerous levels. Such droughts are often associated with low frequency climatic fluctuations, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This paper is part of a study to develop a framework for rainfall probabilistic forecasting using available hydro-climatic information. This paper is the first in a series of three published in this issue, and presents an approach for identifying optimal predictors that can be used to formulate a robust and efficient probabilistic forecast model. The predictor identification approach presented here uses a nonparametric implementation of the mutual information criterion as a measure of dependence between variables. The criterion is based on a characterisation of the joint probability distribution, instead of deviations off a curve of best fit. A "partial" mutual information criterion is presented as the basis for identifying more than one predictor in a stepwise manner. The method uses nonparametric kernel methods to characterise the joint probability distribution of the variables involved. The method is tested on a range of synthetically generated datasets whose dependence attributes are known beforehand. Results from the application of the partial mutual information criterion to identify predictors of quarterly rainfall using a range of hydro-climatic system variables, are presented in the second paper of this three-paper series.

Modelling vegetation change during Late Cenozoic uplift of the East African plateaus	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					NECLIME Annual Meeting	OCT 19-22, 2014	Izmir, TURKEY	NECLIME				The present-day vegetation in the tropics is mainly characterized by forests worldwide except in tropical East Africa, where forests only occur as patches at the coast and in the uplands. These forest patches result from the peculiar aridity that is linked to the uplift of the region during the Late Cenozoic. The Late Cenozoic vegetation history of East Africa is of particular interest as it has set the scene for the contemporary events in mammal and hominin evolution. In this study, we investigate the conditions under which these forest patches could have been connected, and a previous continuous forest belt could have extended and fragmented. We apply a dynamic vegetation model with a set of climatic scenarios in which we systematically alter the present-day environmental conditions such that they would be more favourable for a continuous forest belt in tropical East Africa. We consider varying environmental factors, namely temperature, precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Our results show that all of these variables play a significant role in supporting the forest biomes and a continuous forest belt could have occurred under certain combinations of these settings. With our current knowledge of the palaeoenvironmental history of East Africa, it is likely that the region hosted these conditions during the Late Cenozoic. Recent improvements on environmental hypotheses of hominin evolution highlight the role of periods of short and extreme climate variability during the Late Cenozoic specific to East Africa in driving evolution. Our results elucidate how the forest biomes of East Africa can appear and disappear under fluctuating environmental conditions and demonstrate how this climate variability might be recognized on the biosphere level.

Pollution of fresh groundwater from damaged oil wells, North Kuwait	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater in North Kuwait was polluted by hydrocarbons from destroyed oil wells during the 1991 Gulf War, and by salts derived from seawater used for fighting oil fires. The results of eight rounds of monitoring the groundwater chemistry over the years 2012-2015 have been assessed, based mainly on the presence of organic matter derived from petroleum hydrocarbons and on the total dissolved solids content of groundwater. Good correlations between these two parameters suggest that there is simultaneous movement of hydrocarbons and salts that are leached from the surface soil by the infiltration of surface runoff. It has been concluded that although these parameters have shown some periodical fluctuations in their values, there has been no significant change in the overall extent and severity of groundwater contamination over the period of the study. The fluctuations observed are possibly the results of seasonal addition of pollutants that are carried downwards by the infiltration of rainfall; the effects of biogeochemical reactions within the aquifer; and the movement of pollutants with groundwater flow and dilution by mixing with unpolluted groundwater within the aquifer. The removal of the sources of pollution (oil lakes, oil pits and polluted surface soil) from the study area has been recommended before the adoption of any remedial measures to avoid seasonal addition of pollutants to the treated groundwater.

Phylotype Dynamics of Bacterial P Utilization Genes in Microbialites and Bacterioplankton of a Monomictic Endorheic Lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Microbes can modulate ecosystem function since they harbor a vast genetic potential for biogeochemical cycling. The spatial and temporal dynamics of this genetic diversity should be acknowledged to establish a link between ecosystem function and community structure. In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity of bacterial phosphorus utilization genes in two microbial assemblages, microbialites and bacterioplankton of Lake Alchichica, a semiclosed (i.e., endorheic) system with marked seasonality that varies in nutrient conditions, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and water column stability. We focused on dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) utilization gene dynamics during contrasting mixing and stratification periods. Bacterial alkaline phosphatases (phoX and phoD) and alkaline beta-propeller phytases (bpp) were surveyed. DOP utilization genes showed different dynamics evidenced by a marked change within an intra-annual period and a differential circadian pattern of expression. Although Lake Alchichica is a semiclosed system, this dynamic turnover of phylotypes (from lake circulation to stratification) points to a different potential of DOP utilization by the microbial communities within periods. DOP utilization gene dynamics was different among genetic markers and among assemblages (microbialite vs. bacterioplankton). As estimated by the system's P mass balance, P inputs and outputs were similar in magnitude (difference was < 10 %). A theoretical estimation of water column P monoesters was used to calculate the potential P fraction that can be remineralized on an annual basis. Overall, bacterial groups including Proteobacteria (Alpha and Gamma) and Bacteroidetes seem to be key participants in DOP utilization responses.					; Valdespino, Patricia/M-2413-2018; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/KPY-5742-2024; Valdespino-Castillo, Patricia/M-2413-2018; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Alcantara-Hernandez, Rocio J/A-5054-2010; Falcon, Luisa I/HGU-5682-2022; Merino-Ibarra, Martín/KPY-5742-2024; Macek, Miroslav/B-5428-2015	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; Valdespino, Patricia/0000-0002-4058-9281; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/0000-0002-6690-3101; Valdespino-Castillo, Patricia/0000-0002-2998-4627; Alcantara-Hernandez, Rocio J/0000-0002-6626-715X; Falcon, Luisa I/0000-0002-7210-6483; Macek, Miroslav/0000-0003-0600-3539													0095-3628	1432-184X				FEB	2017	73	2					296	309		10.1007/s00248-016-0862-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-016-0862-1								27726035					WOS:000393713800005
J	Li, YZ; Qin, HY; Xie, YH; Wang, W; Chen, XS; Zhang, CM				Li, Youzhi; Qin, Hongyan; Xie, Yonghong; Wang, Wei; Chen, Xinsheng; Zhang, Canming			Physiological mechanism for the reduction in soil water in poplar (Populus deltoides) plantations in Dongting Lake wetlands	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The use of large-scale tree plantations has provoked increasing concern regarding the negative effects on local environments in different ecosystems. However, the physiological mechanism underlying the reduction in soil water by tree plantations in wetlands is not clear. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of poplar (Populus deltoides) plantations on soil water content and to elucidate the underlying physiological mechanisms. To this end, we conducted a 1-year fixed-plot investigation of soil water content (SWC), plant photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), and water-use efficiency (WUE) of individual leaves of 11- and 5-year-old poplars and of reed (Triarrherca sacchariflora, a native herbaceous plant) in the Dongting Lake wetlands, China. SWC was highest in reed, intermediate in 11-year-old poplar, and lowest in 5-year-old poplar, suggesting that poplar plantations produce a lower soil water content in wetlands. From May to July, Pn was significantly higher in reed than in the two poplar stands, but did not differ between the different-aged poplars. As a whole, Gs and Tr were higher, but WUE was lower, in the poplar stands than in reed during the growing season, indicating that Gs and Tr are the key physiological mechanisms associated with the lower soil water in poplar stands. Relationships among Pn, Gs, and Tr showed positive correlations (P < 0.01) for each type of vegetation. These data suggest that poplar plantations may cause the transformation of wetlands into dry land due to a lower WUE leading to a massive water loss from soil. This, in turn, would have an influence on community composition and ecosystem function after establishment of the plantations.					; æŽ, ç¾Šæœµ/GQZ-5213-2022	Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; , Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X													0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2014	22	1					25	33		10.1007/s11273-013-9319-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-013-9319-1													WOS:000330947700003

Temporal variation of crude and refined oil biodegradation rates and microbial community composition in freshwater systems	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Freshwater systems are vulnerable to contamination by oil extraction and transportation. Thus, it is critical to understand how large freshwater ecosystems such as the Great Lakes will respond to released oil. In this study, we investigated differences in the microbial response to oil in the Straits of Mackinac at different times throughout the year and if crude (Bakken) and refined (non-highway diesel) oil exposure differentially altered the microbial community composition and hydrocarbon biodegradation rates. We also investigated the impact of temperature on the microbial response to oil by incubating samples collected in October of 2018 at 23 degrees C and at 4 degrees C. Ambient microbial communities differed between sample collection times, with significantly enriched microbial groups present between most sample types. We found significantly different microbial communities between control and oil-amended samples, but no significant differences between either oil type. We found that the bacterial family Solimonadaceae were significantly enriched in all oil-amended microcosms compared to the control microcosms across sampling times. We assessed oil biodegradation using CO2 production as a proxy for hydrocarbon metabolism. We observed a general trend of increased respiration rates with oil amendment compared to the control. No statistically significant differences in daily CO2 production rates existed between the two oil types. These findings suggest that microbial community in the Straits of Mackinac shifts over time even without oil amendment, and that the microbial communities in the Straits of Mackinac are compositionally and metabolically responsive to the presence of varying oil types throughout the year.

Aeolian responses to climate variability during the past century on Mesquite Lake Playa, Mojave Desert	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The erosion and deposition of sediments by wind from 1901 to 2013 have created large changes in surface features of Mesquite Lake playa in the Mojave Desert. The decadal scale recurrence of sand-sheet development migration, and merging with older dunes appears related to decadal climatic changes of drought and wetness as recorded in the precipitation history of the Mojave Desert, complemented by modeled soil-moisture index values. Historical aerial photographs, repeat land photographs, and satellite images document the presence and northward migration of a mid-20th century sand sheet that formed during a severe regional drought that coincided with a multi-decadal cool phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The sand sheet slowly eroded during the wetter conditions of the subsequent PDO warm phase (1977-1998) due to a lack of added sediment. Sand cohesion gradually increased in the sand sheet by seasonal additions of salt and clay and by re-precipitation of gypsum, which resulted in the wind-carving of yardangs in the receding sand sheet. Smaller yardangs were aerodynamically shaped from coppice dunes with salt-clay crusts, and larger yardangs were carved along the walls and floor of trough blowouts. Evidence of a 19th century cycle of sand-sheet formation and erosion is indicated by remnants of yardangs, photographed in 1901 and 1916, that were found buried in the mid-20th century sand sheet Three years of erosion measurements on the playa, yardangs, and sand sheets document relatively rapid wind erosion. The playa has lowered 20 to 40 cm since the mid-20th century and a shallow deflation basin has developed since 1999. Annually, 5-10 cm of surface sediment was removed from yardang flanks by a combination of wind abrasion, deflation, and mass movement. The most effective erosional processes are wind stripping of thin crusts that form on the yardang surfaces after rain events and the slumping of sediment blocks from yardang flanks. These wind-eroded landforms persist several decades to a century before eroding away or being buried by younger sands. On Mesquite Lake playa the climatic history of alternating PDO phases of multi-decadal drought and wetness is recorded twice by the presence of yardangs formed nearly a century apart.

We develop methods to compare sediment-charcoal records with. re regimes simulated by an ecological model, ALFRESCO (Alaskan Frame-based Ecosystem Code) and apply these methods to evaluate potential causes of a mid-Holocene. re-regime shift in boreal forests of the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska, USA. Fire-return intervals (FRIs, number of years between. res) are estimated over the past 7000 calibrated C-14 years (7-0 kyr BP [before present]) from short-term variations in charcoal accumulation rates (CHARs) at three lakes, and an index of area burned is inferred from long-term CHARs at these sites. ALFRESCO simulations of FRIs and annual area burned are based on prescribed vegetation and climate for 7-5 kyr BP and 5-0 kyr BP, inferred from pollen and stomata records and qualitative paleoclimate proxies. Two sets of experiments examine potential causes of increased burning between 7-5 and 5-0 kyr BP. (1) Static-vegetation scenarios: white spruce dominates with static mean temperature and total precipitation of the growing season for 7-0 kyr BP or with decreased temperature and/or increased precipitation for 5-0 kyr BP. (2) Changed-vegetation scenarios: black spruce dominates 5-0 kyr BP, with static temperature and precipitation or decreased temperature and/or increased precipitation. Median FRIs decreased between 7-5 and 5-0 kyr BP in empirical data and changed-vegetation scenarios but remained relatively constant in static-vegetation scenarios. Median empirical and simulated FRIs are not statistically different for 7-5 kyr BP and for two changed-vegetation scenarios (temperature decrease, precipitation increase) for 5-0 kyr BP. In these scenarios, cooler temperatures or increased precipitation dampened the effect of increased landscape flammability resulting from the increase in black spruce. CHAR records and all changed-vegetation scenarios indicate long-term increases in area burned between 7-5 and 5-0 kyr BP. The similarity of CHAR and ALFRESCO results demonstrates the compatibility of these independent data sets for investigating ecological mechanisms causing past fire-regime changes. The finding that vegetation flammability was a major driver of Holocene fire regimes is consistent with other investigations that suggest that landscape fuel characteristics will mediate the direct effects of future climate change on boreal fire regimes.

Methods that use diurnal groundwater level (GWL) fluctuations have been applied to various ecosystems, especially in arid or semi-arid environments. In this study, groundwater monitoring devices were deployed in ten lake basins at the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert, and the White method was used to estimate the ETG of these sites under three main vegetation covers. The results showed that regular diurnal fluctuations in GWL occurred only at sites with vegetation coverage and that vegetation types and their growth status were the direct causes of this phenomenon. On a seasonal scale, the amplitudes of diurnal GWL fluctuations are related to vegetation phenology, and air temperature is an important factor controlling phenological amplitude differences. The estimation results using the White method revealed that the ETG rates varied among the observation sites with different vegetation types, and the months with the highest ETG rates were also different among the sites. Overall, ETG was 600 similar to 900 mm at observation sites with Phragmites australis during a growing season (roughly early May to late October), 600 similar to 650 mm in areas with Achnatherum splendens, and 500 similar to 650 mm in areas with Nitraria tangutorum and Achnatherum splendens. Depth to water table and potential evapotranspiration jointly control the ETG rates, while the influence of these two factors varied, depending on the specific vegetation conditions of each site. This study elucidated the relationship between diurnal GWL fluctuations and vegetation in desert groundwater-recharged lake basins and expanded the application of the White method, providing a new basis for the calculation and simulation of regional water balance.

J	Dubois, K; Carignan, R; Veizer, J				Dubois, Kristal; Carignan, Richard; Veizer, Jan			Can pelagic net heterotrophy account for carbon fluxes from eastern Canadian lakes?	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Lakes worldwide are commonly oversaturated with CO2, however the source of this CO2 oversaturation is not well understood. To examine the magnitude of the C flux to the atmosphere and determine if an excess of respiration (R) over gross primary production (GPP) is sufficient to account for this C flux, metabolic parameters and stable isotopes of dissolved O-2 and C were measured in 23 Quebec lakes. All of the lakes sampled were oversaturated with CO2 over the sampling period, on average 221 +/- 25%. However, little evidence was found to conclude that this CO2 oversaturation was the result of an excess of pelagic R over GPP. In lakes Croche and a l'Ours, where CO2 flux, R and GPP were measured weekly, the annual difference between pelagic GPP and R, or net primary production (NPP), was not sufficient to account for the size of the CO2 flux to the atmosphere. In Lac Croche average annual NPP was 14.4 mg C m(-2) d(-1) while the average annual flux Of CO2 to the atmosphere was 34 mg C m(-2) d(-1). In Lac a l'Ours average annual NPP was -9.1 mg C m(-2) d(-1) while the average annual flux Of CO2 to the atmosphere was 55 mg C m(-2) d(-1). In all of the lakes sampled, O-2 Saturation averaged 104.0 +/- 1.7% during the ice-free season and the isotopic composition of dissolved O-2 (delta O-18(DO)) was 22.9 +/- 0.3%, lower than atmospheric values and indicative of net autotrophy. Carbon evasion was not a function of R, nor did the isotopic signature of dissolved CO2 in the lakes present evidence of excess R over GPP. External inputs of C must therefore subsidize the lake to explain the continued CO2 oversaturation. The isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic C (delta C-13(DIC)) indicates that the CO2 oversaturation cannot be attributed to in situ aerobic respiration. delta C-13(DIC) reveals a source of excess C enriched in C-13, which may be accounted for by anaerobic sediment respiration or groundwater inputs followed by kinetic isotope fractionation during degassing under open system conditions.

J	Asaeda, T; Rajapakse, L; Sanderson, B				Asaeda, Takashi; Rajapakse, Lalith; Sanderson, Brian			Morphological and reproductive acclimations to growth of two charophyte species in shallow and deep water	AQUATIC BOTANY												We investigated the distribution of two charophyte species, Chara fibrosa var. fibrosa (A. Br.) and Nitella hyalina (DC.) Ag., in Myall Lake, a shallow lake in New South Wales, Australia, in an attempt to elucidate the factors causing their distribution patterns. The field study was carried out from July 2003 to May 2005 and charophytes were sampled together with bottom sediments at 20 sampling locations in the lake on 13 occasions. Charophyte biomass (0-321 g DW m(-2)) displayed an optimum curve with depth and maximum biomass occurred between 1 and 2.5 m depth. In deeper water, shoots were longer (i.e., around 30 cm at I m depth to 60-90 cm between 2 and 4 m depth). Oospore and antheridia densities were higher in shallower water with a maximum around 80 cm. Plants growing in shallow depths had shorter internodes implying a short life cycle of shoots, and nodal spacing was relatively regular in contrast to its deep water counterparts although spacing tended to increase at locations farther from the apex. The present study also reports that there is an apparent decline in sexual propagule production rates with increasing water depth, further highlighting the different morphological and reproductive acclimations of charophytes in shallow and deep water.

J	Wacker, A; von Elert, E				Wacker, A; von Elert, E			Polyunsaturated fatty acids: Evidence for non-substitutable biochemical resources in Daphnia galeata	ECOLOGY												The factors that determine the efficiency of energy transfer in aquatic food webs have been investigated for many decades. The plant-animal interface is the most variable and least predictable of all levels in the food web. In order to study determinants of food quality in a large lake and to test the recently proposed central importance of the long-chained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at the pelagic producer-grazer interface, we tested the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at the pelagic producer-consumer interface by correlating sestonic food parameters with somatic growth rates of a clone of Daphnia galeata. Daphnia growth rates were obtained from standardized laboratory experiments spanning one season with Daphnia feeding on natural seston from Lake Constance, a large pre-alpine lake. Somatic growth rates were fitted to sestonic parameters by using a saturation function. A moderate amount of variation was explained when the model included the elemental parameters carbon (r(2) = 0.6) and nitrogen (r(2) = 0.71). A tighter fit was obtained when sestonic phosphorus was incorporated (r(2) = 0.86). The nonlinear regression with EPA was relatively weak (r(2) = 0.77), whereas the highest degree of variance was explained by three C-18-PUFAs. The best (r(2) = 0.95), and only significant, correlation of Daphnia's growth was found with the C-18-PUFA alpha -linolenic acid (alpha -LA; C18:3n-3). This correlation was weakest in late August when C:P values increased to 300, suggesting that mineral and PUFA-limitation of Daphnia's growth changed seasonally. Sestonic phosphorus and. some PUFAs showed not only tight correlations with growth, but also with sestonic alpha -LA content. We computed Monte Carlo simulations to test whether the observed effects of alpha -LA on growth could be accounted for by EPA, phosphorus, or one of the two C-18-PUFAs, stearidonic acid (C18:4n-3) and linoleic acid (C18:2n-6). With > 99 % probability, the correlation of growth with alpha -LA could not be explained by any of these parameters. In order to test for EPA limitation of Daphnia's growth, in parallel with experiments on pure seston, growth was determined on seston supplemented with chemostat-grown, P-limited Stephanodiscus hantzschii, which is rich in EPA. Although supplementation increased the EPA content 80-800X, no significant changes in the nonlinear regression of the growth rates with alpha -LA were found, indicating that growth of Daphnia on pure seston was not EPA limited. This indicates that the, two fatty acids, EPA and alpha -LA, were not mutually substitutable biochemical resources and points to different physiological functions of these two PUFAs. These results support the PUFA-limitation hypothesis for sestonic C:P < 300 but are contrary to the hypothesis of a general importance of EPA, since no evidence for EPA limitation was found. It is suggested that the resource ratios of EPA and alpha -LA rather than the absolute concentrations determine which of the two resources is limiting growth.					; von Elert, Eric/S-1666-2018; Wacker, Alexander/I-8277-2012	Wacker, Alexander/0000-0001-9687-6477; von Elert, Eric/0000-0001-7758-716X; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				SEP	2001	82	9					2507	2520		10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[2507:PFAEFN]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[2507:PFAEFN]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000171049100011
J	Turgut, C				Turgut, C			The contamination with organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals in surface water in Kucuk Menderes River in Turkey, 2000-2002	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												This study was conducted from 2000 to 2002 to determine the residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCP) and metals in surface water of Kucuk Menderes River in Turkey. The results showed that Kucuk Menderes River was still polluted with organochlorine pesticide despite the existence of bans over a long time. The concentrations of pesticides depended on the sampling season and the tendency was not the same for all detected pesticides. The DDTs (DDT, DDD, DDE) were detected in most water samples. DDD showed a high concentration among DDTs. The highest concentration among organochlorine pesticides was heptachlor epoxide by 281 ng/l. However, the residues were lower than most polluted water from other sources in the world. In most cases, they were not detectable. The studied surface water metals varied from not detected to 0.258 mg/l, and the residues were low except for Ni, Cu, and Zn. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Carbon isotopic composition of suspended particulate matter and dissolved inorganic carbon in the Cochin estuary during post-monsoon	CURRENT SCIENCE												Detailed measurements of carbon (C) isotopic composition in dissolved inorganic (delta C-13(DIC)) and particulate organic (delta C-13(POC)) fractions were conducted at 18 stations in the Cochin estuary during the post-monsoon season. In general, C biogeochemistry of different regions of the Cochin estuary appears to be regulated by different sources and processes. The northern zone of the estuary appears to be influenced primarily by mixing of sea water enriched in C-13(POC) and C-13(DIC), and river run-off depleted in the same. In contrast, the southern zone of the estuary was found to be greatly influenced by local terrestrial sources. Relatively depleted C-13(POC) in the freshwater Vembanad lake compared to the main estuary suggests inputs from terrestrial sources along with in situ productivity.

Lakes and ponds in the Larsemann Hills and Bolingen Islands (East-Antarctica) were characterised by cyanobacteria-dominated, benthic microbial mats. A 56-lake dataset representing the limnological diversity among the more than 150 lakes and ponds in the region was developed to identify and quantify the abiotic conditions associated with cyanobacterial and diatom communities. 2. Limnological diversity in the lakes of the Larsemann Hills and Bolingen Islands was associated primarily with conductivity and conductivity-related variables (concentrations of major ions and alkalinity), and variation in lake morphometry (depth, catchment and lake area). Low concentrations of pigments, phosphate, nitrogen, DOC and TOC in the water column of most lakes suggest extremely low water column productivity and hence high water clarity, and may thus contribute to the ecological success of benthic microbial mats in this region. 3. Benthic communities consisted of prostrate and sometimes finely laminated mats, flake mats, epilithic and interstitial microbial mats. Mat physiognomy and carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios were strongly related to lake depth, but not to conductivity. 4. Morphological-taxonomic analyses revealed the presence of 26 diatom morphospecies and 33 cyanobacterial morphotypes. Mats of shallow lakes (interstitial and flake mats) and those of deeper lakes (prostrate mats) were characterised by different dominant cyanobacterial morphotypes. No relationship was found between the distribution of these morphotypes and conductivity. In contrast, variation in diatom species composition was strongly related to both lake depth and conductivity. Shallow ponds were mainly characterised by aerial diatoms (e.g. Diadesmis cf. perpusilla and Hantzschia spp.). In deep lakes, communities were dominated by Psammothidium abundans and Stauroforma inermis. Lakes with conductivities higher than +/-1.5 mS cm(-1) became susceptible to freezing out of salts and hence pronounced conductivity fluctuations. In these lakes P. abundans and S. inermis were replaced by Amphora veneta. Stomatocysts were important only in shallow freshwater lakes. 5. Ice cover influenced microbial mat structure and composition both directly by physical disturbance in shallow lakes and by influencing light availability in deeper lakes, as well as indirectly by generating conductivity increases and promoting the development of seasonal anoxia. 6. The relationships between diatom species composition and conductivity, and diatom species composition and depth, were statistically significant. Transfer functions based on these data can therefore be used in paleolimnological reconstruction to infer changes in the precipitation-evaporation balance in continental Antarctic lakes.

Contribution of different zooplankton groups in grazing on phytoplankton in shallow eutrophic Lake Vortsjarv (Estonia)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					The grazing impact of different sized zooplankton on 'edible' and total phytoplankton biomass and primary production was measured in L. Vortsjarv during a seasonal study in 1998 and 2000. The organisms of 48-100 mu m size class, composed of ciliates and rotifers, contributed significantly to the total grazing of zooplankton community throughout the study period (average 68%). The average daily filtering and grazing rate of the whole zooplankton community (micro- and macro-zooplankton) remained low, corresponding to a filtration of 44% of the water volume, 4% of the total phytoplankton biomass and 29% of primary production. However, a strong grazing pressure on small-sized phytoplankton (< 30 mu m) was estimated in most of the study period (average 44% d(-1)). Among size classes of 'edible' phytoplankton, the size range 5-15 mu m was the most important algal food for the dominant zooplankton grazers (herbivorous ciliates, Polyarthra spp., Chydorus sphaericus and Daphnia cucullata) in L. Vortsjarv.

J	Li, L; Xie, P; Chen, J				Li, Li; Xie, Ping; Chen, Jun			Biochemical and ultrastructural changes of the liver and kidney of the phytoplanktivorous silver carp feeding naturally on toxic Microcystis blooms in Taihu Lake, China	TOXICON												Many experimental studies have documented the impact of microcystins (MC) on fish based on either intraperitoneal injection, or oral gavaging via the diet, but few experiments were conducted by MC exposure through natural food uptake in lakes. In this study, the phytoplanktivorous silver carp were stocked in a large pen set in Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake where toxic Microcystis blooms occurred in the warm seasons. Fish samples were collected monthly and MC concentrations in liver and kidney of the fish were determined by LC-MS. The maximum MC concentrations in liver and kidney were present in July when damages in ultrastructures of the liver and kidney were revealed by electron microscope. In comparison with previous studies on common carp, silver carp showed less damage and presence of lysosome proliferation in liver and kidney. Silver carp might eliminate or lessen cell damage caused by MC through lysosome activation. Recovery in the ultrastructures of liver and kidney after Microcystis blooms was companied with a significant decrease or even disappearance of MC. Catalase and glutathione S-transferase in liver and kidney of silver carp during Microcystis blooms were significantly higher than before and after Microcystis blooms. The high glutathione pool in liver and kidney of silver carp suggests their high resistance to MC exposure. The efficient antioxidant defence may be an important mechanism of phytoplanktivorous fish like silver carp to counteract toxic Microcystis blooms. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Wildfire activity in northern Rocky Mountain subalpine forests still within millennial-scale range of variability	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Increasing area burned across western North America raises questions about the precedence and magnitude of changes in fire activity, relative to the historical range of variability (HRV) that ecosystems experienced over recent centuries and millennia. Paleoecological records of past fire occurrence provide context for contemporary changes in ecosystems characterized by infrequent, high-severity fire regimes. Here we present a network of 12 fire-history records derived from macroscopic charcoal preserved in sediments of small subalpine lakes within a c. 10 000 km2 landscape in the U.S. northern Rocky Mountains (Northern Rockies). We used this network to characterize landscape-scale burning over the past 2500 yr, and to evaluate the precedence of widespread regional burning experienced in the early 20th and 21st centuries. We further compare the Northern Rockies fire history to a previously published network of fire-history records in the Southern Rockies. In Northern Rockies subalpine forests, widespread fire activity was strongly linked to seasonal climate conditions, in contemporary, historical, and paleo records. The average estimated fire rotation period (FRP) over the past 2500 yr was 164 yr (HRV: 127-225 yr), while the contemporary FRP from 1900 to 2021 CE was 215 yr. Thus, extensive regional burning in the early 20th century (e.g. 1910 CE) and in recent decades remains within the HRV of recent millennia. Results from the Northern Rockies contrast with the Southern Rockies, which burned with less frequency on average over the past 2500 yr, and where 21st-century burning has exceeded the HRV. Our results support expectations that Northern Rockies fire activity will continue to increase with climatic warming, surpassing historical burning if more than one exceptional fire year akin to 1910 occurs within the next several decades. The ecological consequences of climatic warming in subalpine forests will depend, in large part, on the magnitude of fire-regime changes relative to the past.					; Higuera, Philip/B-1330-2010	McLauchlan, Kendra/0000-0002-6612-1097; Higuera, Philip/0000-0001-5396-9956; Clark-Wolf, Kyra/0000-0003-4584-0348													1748-9326					SEP 1	2023	18	9							094029	10.1088/1748-9326/acee16	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/acee16													WOS:001058754800001

The expression of heat shock proteins is considered a valid indication of protection from the adverse effects of hostile conditions. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the seasonal effects of some abiotic factors on heat shock protein 70 and 90 (HSP70 and HSP90) expression in the liver, gills, and muscle tissues of 24 Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) caught in Karatas Lake (Burdur, Turkiye) using gillnets of various mesh sizes. We also measured some physicochemical parameters on-site at sampling time and took water samples for further analyses of other physicochemical parameters and heavy metals. Immunostaining for HSP90 was stronger than for HSP70 in both liver and gill samples. Liver and gill structures exhibited significant seasonal differences in HSP70 and HSP90 immunoreactivity, and the same was true for immunostaining for HSP70 and HSP90 in muscle samples. Some physicochemical properties seemed to vary considerably between seasons, with Fe, Mn, and Zn levels tending to exhibit changes throughout the seasons. However, these levels were considered acceptable for human health. In conclusion, this study suggests that substantial changes in HSP70 and HSP90 expression may be essential for seasonal adaptation and tolerance. Further research on fish HSPs would greatly contribute to aquaculture, which is essential for meeting food requirements.(c) 2023 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

RESOURCES-BASEL												Lakes are vital components of the Earth's hydrological cycle and are susceptible to the impacts of climate change. Understanding the changes in terms of minimum and maximum lake surface temperatures is crucial for assessing the effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems. This study focuses on ten lakes in Poland to investigate the impacts of climate change on lake temperatures in different geographical regions. The Mann-Kendall (MK) and Sen tests were employed to analyze trends and changes in minimum and maximum water temperatures, respectively. The results reveal significant increases in the minimum and maximum temperatures, particularly in May and June. Different lakes exhibit varying trends and variability in temperature changes over time, indicating the vulnerability of these ecosystems. The current study also examines the magnitude of annual temperature changes and classifies them into different levels. This analysis highlights the complex relationship between air temperature, seasonal cycles, and lake morphometric characteristics in shaping variations in lake surface water temperature. These findings contribute to understanding the impacts of climate change on Poland's lakes and provide valuable insights for developing conservation strategies and adaptive measures to protect freshwater resources.					; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015; Sojka, Mariusz/AFN-8790-2022; Olowoyeye, Temidayo/AEO-4224-2022	Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; Sojka, Mariusz/0000-0002-1453-0374; Olowoyeye, Temidayo/0000-0001-9850-4941; 														2079-9276				SEP	2023	12	9							107	10.3390/resources12090107	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources12090107													WOS:001074251300001

However, the factors affecting the nutrient removal performance of lakeshore MCWs at the field scale are unclear. This study chose a field-scale lakeshore MCW with the highest mass removal efficiency (approximately 49,175.12 mg m(-2) day(-1)) for total nitrogen removal in the wet season to investigate the response of nitrogen removal and microbial distribution to seasonal shock nutrients load. The mass loading rates in the wet season were as high as 43 similar to 72 times over those in the dry season. Hence, a storage pond (SP), as a forebay retention cell, was necessary to mitigate the shock loads of the influent, which is beneficial to nitrogen removal of the MCW system. The two major genera in the sediments are heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification bacteria, and the abundance and species of the nitrogen-related functional genera were higher in the wet season than the dry season. According to the results of redundancy analysis, the hydraulic residence time (29.4%, F = 2.2, p < 0.1) and hydraulic loading rate (85.9, F = 36.5, p < 0.05) were the major factors explaining microbial community variation, instead of environmental factors (temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen). The shock loads of influent and the periodic saturation in sediments contributed to a complicated oxygen and nitrogen nutrient exchange environment resulting in higher abundance and species of nitrogen-related microbes, which is beneficial to nitrogen removal in lakeshore MCWs. The results provided a scientific basis for the optimal design of constructed wetlands on lakeshores.

However, the maintenance of hybrids would not require their superiority under any given set of environmental conditions if their average fitness over longer periods surpassed that of more specialized and less flexible parental clones. Phenotypic plasticity and developmental noise of several hybrid and maternal clones of Daphnia (Daphnia galeata, Daphnia hyalina, their hybrids and backcrosses) were compared in a series of laboratory experiments. Changes in depth selection and body size at first reproduction were scored in Daphnia exposed to predator (planktivorous fish) threat, to the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii), and to the presence of toxic compounds (PCB52 and PCB153). The hybrid clones were found to exhibit the broadest phenotypic plasticity of the studied traits in response to the different stress factors. Developmental noise in depth selection behaviour was the lowest in Daphnia galeata, the highest in Daphnia hyalina, and intermediate in hybrid and backcross clones. This diversity of reaction norms might permit the coexistence of closely related Daphnia clones in the variable and often unpredictable lake environment.					; Pijanowska, Joanna/ACQ-0167-2022; Dawidowicz, Piotr/N-7405-2018	Bernatowicz, Piotr/0000-0002-4404-4924; DAWIDOWICZ, PIOTR/0000-0001-8385-6215; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2021	55	4			SI		1179	1188		10.1007/s10452-021-09898-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-021-09898-7		SEP 2021											WOS:000693874100002

Plasma 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Plasma sex steroid profiles, gonadosomatic index, and ovarian follicle diameter were also described during an entire reproductive cycle. Plasma 11-KT concentration was used to assign sex with 82% accuracy during the entire reproductive cycle, and plasma 11-KT and E2 concentrations were used to assign sex with 98% accuracy when fish were reproductive (i.e., November-March in Lake Roosevelt). Plasma T and E2 concentrations were used to assign reproductive condition in females with 98% accuracy, and plasma T concentration was used to assign reproductive condition in males with 90% accuracy. Ultrasound was used to assign sex with 96% accuracy but was not useful for assigning reproductive condition. Nonlethal tools to assign sex and reproductive condition will enable fisheries biologists to assess reproductive indices of the Burbot population in Lake Roosevelt to inform management decisions.

A Case Study Examining the Efficacy of Drainage Setbacks for Limiting Effects to Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region, USA	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The enhancement of agricultural lands through the use of artificial drainage systems is a common practice throughout the United States, and recently the use of this practice has expanded in the Prairie Pothole Region. Many wetlands are afforded protection from the direct effects of drainage through regulation or legal agreements, and drainage setback distances typically are used to provide a buffer between wetlands and drainage systems. A field study was initiated to assess the potential for subsurface drainage to affect wetland surface-water characteristics through a reduction in precipitation runoff, and to examine the efficacy of current U.S. Department of Agriculture drainage setback distances for limiting these effects. Surface-water levels, along with primary components of the catchment water balance, were monitored over 3 y at four seasonal wetland catchments situated in a high-relief terrain (7-11% slopes). During the second year of the study, subsurface drainage systems were installed in two of the catchments using drainage setbacks, and the drainage discharge volumes were monitored. A catchment water-balance model was used to assess the potential effect of subsurface drainage on wetland hydrology and to assess the efficacy of drainage setbacks for mitigating these effects. Results suggest that overland precipitation runoff can be an important component of the seasonal water balance of Prairie Pothole Region wetlands, accounting on average for 34% (19-49%) or 45% (39-49%) of the annual (includes snowmelt runoff) or seasonal (does not include snowmelt) input volumes, respectively. Seasonal (2014-2015) discharge volumes from the localized drainage systems averaged 81 m(3) (31-199 m(3)), and were small when compared with average combined inputs of 3,745 m(3) (1,214-6,993 m(3)) from snowmelt runoff, direct precipitation, and precipitation runoff. Model simulations of reduced precipitation runoff volumes as a result of subsurface drainage systems showed that ponded wetland surface areas were reduced by an average of 590 m(2) (1411,787 m(2)), or 24% (3-46%), when no setbacks were used (drainage systems located directly adjacent to wetland). Likewise, wetland surface areas were reduced by an average of 141 m(2) (23-464 m(2)), or 7% (1-28%), when drainage setbacks (buffer) were used. In totality, the field data and model simulations suggest that the drainage setbacks should reduce, but not eliminate, impacts to the water balance of the four wetlands monitored in this study that were located in a high-relief terrain. However, further study is required to assess the validity of these conclusions outside of the limited parameters (e.g., terrain, weather, soils) of this study and to examine potential ecological effects of altered wetland hydrology.

Riparian vegetation in the alpine connectome: Terrestrial-aquatic and terrestrial-terrestrial interactions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Alpine regions are under increased attentionworldwide for their critical role in early biogeochemical cycles, their high sensitivity to environmental change, and as repositories of natural resources of high quality. Their riparian ecosystems, at the interface between aquatic and terrestrial environments, play important geochemical functions in the watershed and are biodiversity hotspots, despite a harsh climate and topographic setting. With climate change rapidly affecting the alpine biome, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the extent of interactions between riparian surface, lake and catchment environments. A total of 189 glacial - origin lakes were surveyed in the Central Pyrenees to test howkey elements of the lake and terrestrial environments interact at different scales to shape riparian plant composition. Secondly, we evaluated how underlying ecotope features drive the formation of natural communities potentially sensitive to environmental change and assessed their habitat distribution. At the macroscale, vegetation composition responded to pan-climatic gradients altitude and latitude, which captured in a narrow geographic area the transition between large European climatic zones. Hydrodynamics was the main catchment-scale factor connecting riparian vegetation with major water fluxes, followed by topography and geomorphology. Lake sediment Mg and Pb, and water Mn and Fe contents reflected local influences from mafic bedrock and soil water saturation. Community analysis identified four keystone ecosystems: (i) damp ecotone, (ii) snow bed-silicate bedrock, (iii) wet heath, and (iv) calcareous substrate. These communities and their connectionswith ecotope elements could be at risk froma number of environmental change factors includingwarmer seasons, snowline and lowland species advancement, increased nutrient/metal input andwater level fluctuations. The results imply important natural terrestrial-aquatic linkages in the riparian environment at a wide range of scales, which could help better address further biomic impacts of environmental change.

Phytoplankton seasonal and vertical variations in a tropical shallow reservoir with abundant macrophytes (Ninf,ias Pond, Brazil)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study aimed at analyzing the environmental factors which determine the structure and dynamic of phytoplankton in a shallow reservoir with abundant macrophyte flora, Ninf,ias Pond (Brazil). It is hypothesized that, although its shallowness, periodic stratifications play an important role on its phytoplankton community. Water samples were collected monthly, from January to December 1997, in four depths (sub-surface, 1 m, 2 m, and bottom) of pelagic zone (Z (max) = 3.6 m). Community seasonal and vertical variations followed a hot-rainy season with water column stratification (phase 1; Q index: medium), alternating with a cool-dry season with water column mixing (phase 2: Q index: excellent). Nanoplanktonic flagellates dominated, mainly mixotrophic species. During phase 1, Chlamydomonas sp. (G) was the main species, dominating at the anoxic and nutrient-rich hypolimnion. At the same time, richness and diversity were relatively lower. During phase 2, lower water temperatures and higher dissolved oxygen concentrations favoured the prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina cf. breviturrita (X2). Sequence of functional groups over phases 1 and 2 was: phase 1 = G -> transition = Y/P/E/D/F/W2/X3 -> phase 2 = X2/Lo/X1; most of these groups have been associated to oligo-mesotrophic systems. Seasonal stratifications played a decisive role in determining the structure and dynamic of phytoplankton in the Ninf,ias Pond. However, in such a complex and heterogeneous system, other compartments of the food web (macrophytes, zooplankton, fishes) may also act as relevant driving forces, in synergy with the physical and chemical environment.					; Bicudo, Carlos/D-2302-2015; Fonseca, Barbara/AAD-9760-2019	Fonseca, Barbara/0000-0002-7898-771X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2011	665	1					229	245		10.1007/s10750-011-0626-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0626-3													WOS:000288515500018

However, little is known about the relationship between DOM components and rotifers in natural rivers, relative to the cladocerans and copepods. Here, we investigated the spatial patterns of rotifer distribution in relation to DOM by collecting forty-four water samples from four areas in the middle reaches of Huai River Basin. Results revealed that DOM was described by two humic-like and two protein-like components. There were significant differences in the composition and diversity of rotifer communities among areas, which might be related to autochthonous and allochthonous DOM as well as geographical distances. Specifically, rotifer communities were mainly related to molecular weight, substituents on the aromatic ring, humification level, and protein-like materials. Autochthonous and fresh DOM was positively associated with rotifer abundance and richness, and terrigenous humic-like substances were positively associated with rotifer diversity and evenness. There was a reciprocal effect between rotifer and DOM. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of the possible effects of water browning on rotifer communities, providing new insights into the key role of DOM and rotifer in the energy transfer of aquatic systems.

J	Arnoux, M; Barbecot, F; Gibert-Brunet, E; Gibson, J; Noret, A				Arnoux, Marie; Barbecot, Florent; Gibert-Brunet, Elisabeth; Gibson, John; Noret, Aurelie			Impacts of changes in groundwater recharge on the isotopic composition and geochemistry of seasonally ice-covered lakes: insights for sustainable management	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lakes are under increasing pressure due to widespread anthropogenic impacts related to rapid development and population growth. Accordingly, many lakes are currently undergoing a systematic decline in water quality. Recent studies have highlighted that global warming and the subsequent changes in water use may further exacerbate eutrophication in lakes. Lake evolution depends strongly on hydrologic balance, and therefore on groundwater connectivity. Groundwater also influences the sensitivity of lacustrine ecosystems to climate and environmental changes, and governs their resilience. Improved characterization of groundwater exchange with lakes is needed today for lake preservation, lake restoration, and sustainable management of lake water quality into the future. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to determine if the future evolution of the climate, the population, and the recharge could modify the geochemistry of lakes (mainly isotopic signature and quality via phosphorous load) and if the isotopic monitoring of lakes could be an efficient tool to highlight the variability of the water budget and quality. ' Small groundwater-connected lakes were chosen to simulate changes in water balance and water quality expected under future climate change scenarios, namely representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Contemporary baseline conditions, including isotope mass balance and geochemical characteristics, were determined through an intensive field-based research program prior to the simulations. Results highlight that future lake geochemistry and isotopic composition trends will depend on four main parameters: lo-cation (and therefore climate conditions), lake catchment size (which impacts the intensity of the flux change), lake volume (which impacts the range of variation), and lake G index (i.e., the percentage of groundwater that makes up total lake inflows), the latter being the dominant control on water balance conditions, as revealed by the sensitivity of lake isotopic composition. Based on these model simulations, stable isotopes appear to be especially useful for detecting changes in recharge to lakes with a G index of between 50 and 80 %, but response is non-linear. Simulated monthly trends reveal that evolution of annual lake isotopic composition can be dampened by opposing monthly recharge fluctuations. It is also shown that changes in water quality in groundwater-connected lakes depend significantly on lake location and on the intensity of recharge change.					; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009; GIBERT-BRUNET, Elisabeth/MEO-1966-2025	Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228; GIBERT-BRUNET, Elisabeth/0000-0001-7783-7536; Barbecot, Florent/0000-0002-3286-3156; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				NOV 27	2017	21	11					5875	5889		10.5194/hess-21-5875-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5875-2017													WOS:000416264000002

Science & Technology Agenda for Blue-Green Spaces Inspired by Citizen Science: Case for Rejuvenation of Powai Lake	SUSTAINABILITY												Urban lakes play a major role in the socio-cultural and ecological sustainability of many cities, but are often under major development and pollution pressures. Urban decision makers are faced with a challenging task of identifying the causes of their decline and building plans for their conservation or rejuvenation. Powai Lake is a perfect example of an urban water body with historic, cultural, and ecological importance to the population of Metropolitan Mumbai, with local and regional authorities, including the Urban Development Department, Government of Maharashtra, working to identify methods for rejuvenating the Lake. In this context, characterization of pollution dynamics, hotspots, and extent is fundamental to the development of management plans and appropriate technologies for the remediation and rejuvenation of Powai Lake-the long-term goal of the present study. A two-year monitoring program at eight sampling locations on the Lake's periphery, with the engagement of citizen scientists along with environmental researchers, revealed clear seasonal and spatial dynamics that allowed for the identification of pollution drivers and the development of a three-phase rejuvenation plan. The plan represents a novel and holistic approach that recognizes Powai Lake as a complex system with multiple drivers, and aims at ecological balance and sustainable delivery of ecosystem services.

Snails were obtained over two consecutive years, 2009 and 2010, from 10 water bodies located in central Poland. The relationship between the seasons and the occurrence of patent invasions in hosts found in the shore-zone of lakes was observed. Behavioural experiments conducted on P. corneus individuals placed in a thermal gradient demonstrated that parasite infection had an impact on the thermal preferences of the snails. Individuals that shed cercariae of Bilharziella polonica, Cotylurus sp., Notocotylus ephemera, Rubenstrema exasperatum/Neoglyphe locellus. Rubenstrema opisthovitellinum, or Tylodelphys excavata displayed symptoms of behavioural anapyrexia, similarly to experimentally injured snails. This response increased the survival of infected individuals while simultaneously prolonging the period of shedding of dispersive forms of parasites. This point of view was upheld by the observation that infected snails bred at 19 degrees C lived longer than at 26 degrees C and the shedding rate of cercariae at a lower temperature was lower than at a higher one.

Temporal variation in freshwater viral and bacterial community composition	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The goal of this study conducted in three lakes differing in nutrient content and size was to assess the temporal variation in viral community composition and possible co-variation with compositional changes in bacterial communities. 2. The viral community composition differed among lakes and changed over the season. Changes could also be detected on short-time scales, i.e. over a few days. These changes were comparable in magnitude to the changes detected between months or seasons. 3. The most important environmental factors co-varying with viral community composition, as determined by multivariate analysis, differed over the year and among lakes. Temperature and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus were the most important factors. 4. Bacterial community composition also varied over the season and among lakes. The most important factors co-varying with bacterial community composition, as determined by multivariate analysis, were also temperature and DOC concentration. 5. Correlation between viral and bacterial community composition was weak and appeared to be a result of an indirect connection rather than a direct relationship between bacteria and viruses.					; Lymer, David/AAP-8593-2020; Logue, Jürg/AAF-7347-2020; Lindström, Eva/H-5930-2016	Lindstrom, Eva/0000-0001-8920-3071; Brussaard, Corina/0000-0002-6320-9229; Lymer, David/0000-0002-3678-2150; Logue, Jurg Brendan/0000-0001-8838-0914													0046-5070					JUN	2008	53	6					1163	1175		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01882.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01882.x													WOS:000255713100009
J	Yu, YH; Yan, QY; Feng, WS				Yu, Yuhe; Yan, Qingyun; Feng, Weisong			Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of plankton communities in Lake Donghu, China, as revealed by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and its relation to biotic and abiotic factors	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The 16S and 18S rRNA genes of planktonic organisms derived from five stations with nutrient gradients in Lake Donghu, China, were studied by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting, and the relationships between the genetic diversity of the plankton community and biotic/abiotic factors are discussed. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), NH4-N and As were found to be significantly related (P < 0.05) to morphological composition of the plankton community. Both chemical and morphological analyses suggested that temporal heterogeneity was comparatively higher than spatial heterogeneity in Lake Donghu. Although the morphological composition was not identical to the DGGE fingerprints in characterizing habitat similarity, the two strongest eutrophic stations (I and II) were always initially grouped into one cluster. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that the factors strongly correlated with the first two ordination axes were seasonally different. The concentrations of TN and TP and the densities of rotifers and crustaceans were generally the main factors related to the DGGE patterns of the plankton communities. The study suggested that genetic diversity as depicted by metagenomic techniques (such as PCR-DGGE fingerprinting) is a promising tool for ecological study of plankton communities and that such techniques are likely to play an increasingly important role in assessing the environmental conditions of aquatic habitats.

J	Gillanders, BM				Gillanders, BM			Connectivity between juvenile and adult fish populations: do adults remain near their recruitment estuaries?	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Juvenile snapper Pagrus auratus (Sparidae) were collected from 15 estuaries during the recruitment season of 1998-99 and their otoliths were analysed to determine concentrations of chemical elements. Differences in elemental composition of juveniles were found among estuaries or groups of estuaries suggesting that the nursery or recruitment estuary of adult fish could be determined by analysing the juvenile region of adult otoliths. Adult fish from the commercial fishery in the vicinity of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia were then collected, their ages estimated and fish with birth years during 1998-99 selected for microchemical analysis. to determine their recruitment estuary. Maximum likelihood analyses were used to determine the proportion of juvenile fish and adult fish from different regions (Wallis Lake, Sydney estuaries, Eden, and other estuaries). For juvenile fish, the actual composition ranged from 7 to 53% depending on the estuary or group of estuaries and the estimate of proportion of juveniles from the different estuaries ranged from 7.24 to 48.21% suggesting an error rate of < 1 to 4.79%. Most (89%) adult fish caught as part of the snapper fishery in the Sydney region originated from local estuaries, although about 9% of fish had Eden as their recruitment estuary and 2% had come from the remaining estuaries excluding Wallis Lake, which contributed no fish. These results suggest that adults on reefs outside estuaries in the Sydney region have come from the estuaries closest to them with little transfer from other estuaries. For other regions, 2 scenarios are possible, namely, adults originated from estuaries close by with little transfer from other estuaries, or alternatively estuaries in the vicinity of Sydney supply the majority of adult fish along the coast. The latter situation is considered unlikely. Results show a link between juvenile and adult populations and suggest that populations of snapper may be self-sustaining or relatively closed.

Phytoplankton assessments have been used to predict impairment of lentic ecosystems. The aim of the study was to assess species-stressor associations and the ecological status of eight lakes in the Antalya River basin using phytoplankton indices throughout wet and dry periods according to the Water Framework Directive. The analysis of similarities test revealed a significant difference in the composition of species between the wet (May) and dry (August and November) seasons (p < 0.05). The canonical correspondence analysis indicated that alkalinity, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, total phosphorus (TP), and arsenic (As) had significant effects on the distribution of phytoplankton among lakes. Lake Titreyen was associated with high EC and characterized by pollution-tolerant species. Lake Egri was under the pressure of TP and As, while Lake Kirkgoz was associated with relatively high alkalinity. The findings of the phyto-assessment indicated that Lake Egri is in good ecological condition, while Lake Duruca is in high ecological condition. Sondergaard metric based on the cyanobacteria biovolume values indicated that Lake Egri had a moderate ecological status, whereas Lake Duruca had a good environmental condition. To evaluate the ecological status of lakes, the modified phytoplankton trophic index could be a suitable metric. Results of the present study underlined the responses of phytoplankton species in various lakes to environmental variables, which provide crucial ecological information about their ecology and help in the estimation of the ecological status of lakes.

Study focus: Stable isotopes of water (Oxygen-18 and Deuterium) were used as tracers to estimate the contribution of groundwater in shallow hillslope aquifers to streamflow in the Robit-Bata watershed. To assess the spatiotemporal variability of shallow groundwater and develop a hydrograph separation technique, we collected rainfall, shallow groundwater, and streamflow samples and analyzed their delta O-18 and delta(2H) isotopic compositions. The local meteoric water line (LMWL) and local evaporative line (LEL) of the study area were determined and compared with the global meteoric water line (GMWL). A standard unweighted two-component isotope-based hydrograph separation model was used to determine the percentage contribution of shallow groundwater to streamflow. New hydrological insights for the region: The LMWL (delta H-2 = 8.63.delta O-18 + 18.2) mostly showed heavy isotopic enrichment relative to GMWL, and the LEL (delta H-2 = 5.45.delta O-18 + 6.96) indicated isotopic enrichment compared to Ethiopian lakes. Shallow groundwater responded rapidly to rainfall, with good spatial correlation depending on topographic positions of wells. Pre-event water contributed <50% to peak discharge in July, but >90% when the watershed reached maximum storage. This finding gives insight towards the predominant runoff generation process and has significant implications for sustainable dry season irrigation expansion in the area as the subsurface flow drains out of the watershed from October onwards reducing water tables in the shallow wells.

Measuring bismuth-210, its parent, and daughter in aquatic systems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Bi-210 (t(1/2): 5.01 d)-the daughter of Pb-210 and parent of Po-210-has rarely been measured in aquatic systems, and its behavior in the water column is poorly understood. In this article, I present a method for quickly measuring Pb-210, Bi-210, and Po-210 in aquatic samples, where (1) Bi-210 and Po-210 are scavenged onto an anion solid-phase extraction disk within 15 min of pretreating the sample; (2) beta decay of Bi-210 is counted on the disk immediately thereafter; (3) Po-210 is subsequently removed from the disk and redeposited on a copper plate for alpha-spectroscopy; and (4) Pb-210 is determined via the ingrowth of Bi-210. I present decay-corrected calculations for total, dissolved, and particle-bound fractions of each nuclide and conclude with an analysis of Pb-210, Bi-210, and Po-210 activities in rain, dreissenid (quagga) mussels, and water samples from the Milwaukee Inner Harbor in Lake Michigan. Results show that the loss of lead on the anion solid-phase extraction disks was negligible (0.2% +/- 2.1%; +/- 1 SD, n = 4), and the sorption of bismuth was complete (99% +/- 2%; +/- 1 SD, n = 16). Relative mean absolute deviations of duplicate sample analyses of lake water were 2.4% +/- 1.9% for Pb-210 (geometric mean of total sample activity: 3.0 disintegrations per minute [dpm], n = 6), 7.7% +/- 5.8% for Bi-210 (geometric mean of total sample activity: 2.6 dpm, n = 8), and 2.7% +/- 1.7% for Po-210 (geometric mean of total sample activity: 1.4 dpm, n = 8).

Geochemistry of wetlands provides explicit mechanisms for permanent P-sequestration in sediments. This study had two goals: (1) Find P removal performance and rate at the highest alum doses that do not produce floc in an SF wetland; and (2) Determine potential improvements to P removal performance with low alum doses in a 140-ha land application system downstream from the wetland. The study started with a small fraction of a conventional, flocculation/sedimentation alum dose, then progressively increased the dose to observe initiation of floc formation and removal of P. For flows near 10 megaliters per day in an 0.8 ha SF wetland, doses started 189 Ld(-1) for two weeks, then increasing by 189 L d(-1) every two weeks until the final two weeks at 946 L d(-1). At an alum dosing rate of 189 L d(-1) (alum concentration of 9.5 mg L-1), there was an order of magnitude improvement in P removal rates over literature values. Floc formation in the wetland was observed at 567 L d(-1), but no significant improvement in P removal rates were observed until a conventional alum dose of 946 L d(-1) was applied. Alum addition improved P removal performance in the land application system. In 2014, during which there was no alum dosing, the median effluent total P (TP) during the July-September dry season (groundwater dominated outflow) was 0.43 mg L-1. In 2015, (alum dosing August-October) median dry weather TP of 0.18 mg L-1 was significantly lower (p < 0.0001). Alum dosing in 2016 at 189 L d(-1) produced a dry weather median of 0.28 mg L-1, which was significantly lower (p = 0.015) than in the 2014 median. Mean daily dry weather TP loads to the land application system were 44 kg d(-1) in 2014, 45 kg d(-1) in 2015, and 41 kg d(-1) in 2016. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Stomach contents and stable isotopes confirm ontogenetic diet shifts of (4) Chock for Nile perch, Lates niloticus, in southern Lake Victoria	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					African Great Lakes Conference (AGLC) - Conservation and Development in a Changing Climate	MAY, 2017	Entebbe, UGANDA					Nile perch (Lates niloticus), a main target for Lake Victoria's fisheries, shifts its diet from invertebrates to fish during its ontogeny. We combined stomach contents with stable isotopes to study these diet shifts in Mwanza Gulf, southern Lake Victoria. During four seasons between 2009 and 2011 we collected and analysed 6697 stomachs and 516 stable isotope samples of Nile perch. Caridina shrimp and haplochromine cichlids were the major food items in Nile perch of 5-40 cm. Based on stomach contents, the shift of dominance of Caridina towards haplochromines in the diet varied from 6.7 cm length in the southern part of the gulf, to >20 cm in the northern part, possibly related to the higher abundance of Caridina in the north. In general isotope-based and stomach content-based estimates of Nile perch diets agreed. We observed only two discrepancies: in Nile perch >20 cm, the isotope-based estimates of the contribution of haplochromines to the diet were much lower than based on stomach contents and the contribution of juvenile Nile perch to the diet were much higher in the isotope based estimates than in the stomach based-based estimates. This discrepancy may be explained by e.g. different timespan-coverages between isotopes and stomach contents, by movements of Nile perch between the Gulf and the rest of Lake Victoria, or by the overlapping isotopic profiles of haplochromines and juvenile Nile perch. With the recent recovery of haplochromines in Lake Victoria, Nile perch appears to rely more on this prey again, as it did in the 1980s. (C) 2018 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

In particular, large cyanobacterial colonies that are buoyant on the water surface may provide a distinct habitat for bacteria from other small particles that are suspended stably in the water column. To test this hypothesis, bacterial communities (excluding cyanobacteria) attached to large particles dominated by cyanobacterial colonies (>120 mu m, LA), small particles (3-36 mu m, SA), and free-living bacteria (0.2-3 mu m, FL) were investigated monthly for a year in Lake Taihu, China. Results confirmed that the Shannon diversity index of LA was significantly lower than that of FL, which was lower than that of SA. Cytophagia and Alphaproteobacteria were specially enriched in LA. Although samples in each habitat collected during high- (May to November) and low-bloom seasons (December to April) were separated, all samples in LA were clustered and separated from SA and FL, which were also clustered during the same sampling seasons. In addition, the bacterial communities in LA were correlated with nitrate level, whereas FL and SA were correlated with nitrate level and temperature. Mantel analysis revealed that bacterial composition significantly correlated with the cyanobacterial composition in LA and FL but not in SA. These results indicate that LA provides distinct niches to bacteria, whereas the differentiation of bacterial communities in FL and SA is seasonally dependent.					; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021	Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004; 													2045-8827					DEC	2018	7	6							e608	10.1002/mbo3.608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mbo3.608								29573241					WOS:000453616500008

InSAR coherence for automated lake ice extent mapping: TanDEM-X bistatic and pursuit monostatic results	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												TanDEM-X bistatic and pursuit monostatic InSAR coherence offer different utility for lake ice extent mapping. Both facilitate ice-water discrimination largely independent of the SAR incidence angle but only pursuit monostatic coherence does so under all wind conditions. Relative to backscatter intensity-the basis for most existing mapping approaches-pursuit monostatic coherence offers enhanced utility. Our automated mapping approach combines basic interferometric processing, ice-water classification using a 0.3 coherence threshold and geospatial analysis to separate lakes from land. The approach is developed and demonstrated using TanDEM-X pursuit monostatic data acquired during freeze-up but should also be of use for the mapping of lake icebreakup. Early in the freeze-up season, the extent of lake ice is underestimated due to the commission of new ice-estimated age <= 5 days-in the water class. An evaluation of coherence for sample regions reveals three principal-surface cover and cooperative mode dependent-decorrelation sources: temporal change, additive noise and multiplicative noise. TanDEM-X operated in its pursuit monostatic mode for a limited time in support of scientific studies. The introduction of a system with a fully operational capacity to acquire near-simultaneous InSAR images would benefit operational users concerned with lake ice extent mapping and-we expect-many others that deal with water or other rapidly changing features.						van der Sanden, Josephus Johannes/0000-0003-0407-2733; Short, Naomi/0000-0002-4677-9801													0303-2434					DEC	2018	73						605	615		10.1016/j.jag.2018.08.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.08.009													WOS:000446291100052

The composition of small mammals and the herbaceous community was examined in four habitat types: F (farmland), S (where agriculture continued, but human habitation ceased), R (farmland reconverted back to seasonally flooded wetlands), and B (aboriginal seasonally flooded wetlands). Using various diversity indices, the data showed that the small mammal community changed in parallel with the succession of the herbaceous community. Compared to F, there was little change in S, whereas R noticeably changed. Microtus fortis inhabited R, because Carex spp. was the dominant plant species. R held a mixture dominant species from both F and B, demonstrating that R was in transition (intermediate stages of succession) from F to B. However, the status of the small mammal community in B changed in 2008-2010, due to the operation of the Three-Gorge Reservoir (TGR). In conclusion, our observations demonstrate that the succession of the small mammal community in habitats R and B are directly influenced by human activity in the region, with monitoring being required to continue documenting these changes.					; Zhenggang, Xu/ABE-9095-2020	Zhenggang, Xu/0000-0002-7401-5163; 													1343-4152	1348-6160				DEC	2018	43	4					229	243		10.3106/ms2017-0043	http://dx.doi.org/10.3106/ms2017-0043													WOS:000456708400002

Net mineralization and microbial immobilization were studied by the buried bag method and ecosystem pool sizes of C, N and P were determined by harvest methods. The highest amounts of organic N and P were bound in the soil organic matter. Microbial N and P constituted the largest labile pools often equal to (N) or exceeding (P) the amounts stored in the vegetation. Despite large pools of N and P in the soil, net mineralization of N and P was generally low during the growing season, except in the wet sedge tundra, and in most cases lower than the plant uptake requirement. In contrast, the microorganisms immobilized high amounts of nutrients in the buried bags during incubation. The same high immobilization was not observed in the surrounding soil, where the microbial nutrient content in most cases remained constant or decreased over the growing season. This suggests that the low mineralization measured in many arctic ecosystems over the growing season is due to increased immobilization by soil microbes when competition from plant roots is prevented. Furthermore, it suggests that plants compete well with microbes for nutrients in these four ecosystems. Warming increased net mineralization in several cases, which led to increased assimilation of nutrients by plants but not by the microbes.

Dispersal Patterns of Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass Following Early-, Mid-, and Late-Season Fishing Tournaments in an Eastern Ontario Lake	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Black bass fishing tournaments with conventional weigh-ins tend to displace fish from their capture site and often release fish within close proximity to the weigh-in site. Tournaments often include Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu and occur throughout fishing seasons; however, there have yet to be any systematic congeneric comparisons across different seasons. Objectives of our study were to (1) assess post-tournament dispersal of Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass (i.e., short-term stockpiling-accumulation of fish around weigh-in site <1 month after tournament) across seasons, and (2) determine the success of return to the main basin. Research took place on Big Rideau Lake in eastern Ontario and included a preseason control (N = 30) where fish were captured, acoustically tagged, and released at the site of tournament weigh-in (Rideau Ferry). Tournament-caught bass (N = 88 total) were tagged at three tournaments that spanned June (early season), August (midseason), and October (late season). Our results indicated a brief short-term stockpiling (within 300 m) in all seasons, and all detected fish eventually returned to the main basin. Tournament-caught Largemouth Bass tended to take longer to disperse from the release site following the midseason tournament (4.6 d); Smallmouth Bass tended to disperse from release site <1 d following all treatments. Similarly, tournament-caught Largemouth Bass exposed to the midseason tournament tended to take the longest to redistribute to the main basin (238 d) in comparison to other treatments. Although Smallmouth Bass tended to redistribute to the main basin faster than Largemouth Bass, late-season Smallmouth Bass tended to redistribute the slowest (101 d) following tournament release. Although fish do survive and eventually return to the main basin, displacement may have broader ecological consequences (i.e., large-scale displacement of top predators, adverse effects on recruitment) such that there would be merit in more catch-weigh-release formatted events.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Lédée, Elodie/X-1537-2019; Lawrence, Michael/AAC-9979-2019	Lawrence, Michael/0000-0002-4801-1580; Holder, Peter/0000-0002-5420-6720; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659													0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2021	41	5					1454	1464		10.1002/nafm.10664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10664		AUG 2021											WOS:000691005500001

Of these, the pit lakes Polen and Norrtorpssjon are the focus of this study. They have elevated levels of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al, Mn, Fe, and sulphate, as well as trace elements, from weathering of the exposed shale. Both lakes had a stable pH below 4 until 1996 when the pH in Norrtorpssjon started to increase, exceeding 8 in 2010, due to inflow of leachates from alkaline waste dumped in an adjacent waste deposit, similar to a large scale anoxic limestone drain (ALD). Iron and Al concentrations decreased as the pH increased, indicating formation of particulate species which accumulate as sediments. The Co, Ni, and Zn concentrations also decreased, probably due to association with the solid phases, while Cu was less affected by the increase in pH, possibly due to formation of complexes with dissolved organic matter. Vanadium concentrations show limited solubility, while Mo concentrations increased at higher pH. Uranium concentrations decreased from above 80 mu g/L to below 10 mu g/L before rising to 30-35 mu g/L due to the formation of soluble carbonate complexes at higher pH levels. The elevated levels of Li, Sr, and U indicate that weathering has continued despite the pH change. Both pit lakes are stratified, but no seasonal overturn has been observed. Long-term behaviour of this large-scale ALD and its implications are also discussed.

A review of relevant literature was done to determine the degree of cyanotoxin occurrence and its harmful effects in African waterbodies. Data were extracted from 64 published studies from 1990 to 2022 that quantified the concentration of cyanotoxins in African aquatic ecosystems. Cyanotoxins have been reported in 95 waterbodies (29 lakes, 41 reservoirs, 10 ponds, 9 rivers, 5 coastal waters, and 1 irrigation canal) from 15 African countries. Cyanotoxins were documented in all the regions of Africa except the central region. Microcystins have been reported in nearly all waterbodies (98.9%), but anatoxin-a (5.3%), cylindrospermopsin (2.1%), nodularins (2.1%), homoanatoxin-a (1.1%), and & beta;-N-methylamino-l-alanine (1.1%) were encountered in a small number of water ecosystems, homoanatoxin-a and & beta;-N-methylamino-l-alanine each occurred in one waterbody. The largest concentrations of microcystins and nodularins were reported in South African Lakes Nhlanganzwani (49,410 & mu;g L-1) and Zeekoevlei (347,000 & mu;g g(-1)). Microcystin concentrations exceeding the WHO guideline for lifetime drinking water (1 & mu;g L-1) were reported in 63% of the aquatic ecosystems surveyed. The most frequently reported toxin-producing cyanobacteria genus is Microcystis spp. (73.7%), followed by Oscillatoria spp. (35.8%) and Dolichospermum spp. (33.7%). Cyanotoxin-related animal mortality and human illness were reported in the continent. Consequently, it is necessary to regularly monitor the level of nutrients, cyanobacteria, and cyanotoxins in African waterbodies in an integrated manner to devise a sustainable water resources management.					; Workie, Tesfaye/GWU-9591-2022; Engdaw, Flipos/MGT-5061-2025	Muluye, Tesfaye/0000-0002-6983-8608; Fetahi, Tadesse/0000-0002-7586-5354													0269-4042	1573-2983				NOV	2023	45	11					7519	7542		10.1007/s10653-023-01724-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-023-01724-3		AUG 2023						37603139					WOS:001052024000001

TSS ranged from 0.6 to 200.3 mg/L and from 0.6 to 78 mg/L respectively in the mainstream and in a typical reservoir-bay (the Xiangxi Bay) of the TGR,. TSS exhibited a typical seasonal pattern in the mainstream rather than in the Xiangxi Bay of the TGR. The fraction of non-volatile suspended solids (NVSS) was often more dominant in the mainstream than in the Xiangxi Bay, especially during the flood season. Regressions analysis showed that 87.6% and 89.8% of seasonal variation in TSS and NVSS of the mainstream, respectively, are explained by water residence time. In contrast, suspended solids (particularly volatile suspended solids, VSS) of the Xiangxi Bay displayed significant correlation with algal biomass, and no correlation with hydrological parameters. It implies that the Xiangxi Bay was a more autochthonous system than the mainstream of the TGR where exogenous influences were the more determinant factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Teranes, JL; Bernasconi, SM				Teranes, JL; Bernasconi, SM			Factors controlling δ13C values of sedimentary carbon in hypertrophic Baldeggersee, Switzerland, and implications for interpreting isotope excursions in lake sedimentary records	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We use stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13) in sedimented organic matter and carbonate as proxy indicators of productivity changes in a highly eutrophic to hypertrophic lake. Stable isotope data from a seasonally sampled sediment core recovered from Baldeggersee, Switzerland were compared with direct and inferred total phosphorus (P) concentrations. Carbon isotope values of sedimentary organic matter (delta C-13(org)) in both seasonal varves and over the past 100 yr are not linearly related to total P concentrations, nor do they mirror observed trends in carbonate isotope values (delta C-13(CaCO3)). Baldeggersee delta C-13(org) values are influenced by both variations in the relative inputs of eukaryotic biomass, which becomes enriched in C-13 with increasing primary productivity, and the contribution of microbial biomass produced in the expanding anoxic bottom waters, which is typically very depleted in C-13. We also examined the fractionation within the organic matter-CO2-CaCO3 system, calculated as epsilon(total organic carbor(TOC)) = 10(3){[(delta C-13(CaCO3) + 1,000)/(delta C-13(org) + 1,000)] - 1}. Thresholds within the measured epsilon(TOC) values represent Baldeggersee trophic status more accurately than delta C-13(org) or delta C-13(CaCO3) values alone. In alkaline lakes with endogenic carbonate precipitates, STOC values can facilitate accurate interpretation of values and trends in organic carbon isotope data, and can help to better assess trophic history and lake remediation efforts in lake systems that have been heavily affected by cultural eutrophication.

To enable realistic experimental studies of the effects of higher temperatures on in-lake processes and dynamics, technologically advanced systems are required. This paper presents design details, operating characteristics, and background information on a currently operating experimental flow-through mesocosm system that allows investigation of the interactions between simulated climate warming and eutrophication and their impacts on biological structure and ecosystem processes in shallow lakes. We use 24 mesocosms to combine three temperature scenarios ( one unheated and two heated relative to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate scenario A2 and A2 + 50%, respectively) and two nutrient levels ( enriched and nonenriched). Planktivorous fish ( male sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus) are stocked in accordance with the nutrient level. The water residence time is regulated by the semicontinuous addition of water and is approximately 2.5 mo in each mesocosm. For heating, we use electrically powered heating elements. The heating system has performed well over 16 mo of continuous heating, and seasonal and diurnal temperature variations of the unheated reference mesocosms were paralleled well by the heated mesocosms. The performance of the flow- through system and the heating technique are discussed with special emphasis on strengths, limitations, and potential improvements of the system. To illustrate the performance of the system and its potential, we present data for selected periods on total phosphorus retention in the mesocosms and system primary production and respiration.					; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/J-2478-2013; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/K-8423-2014; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Richardson, Katherine/D-7592-2014	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/0000-0002-3324-1017; Richardson, Katherine/0000-0003-3785-2787													1541-5856					JAN	2005	3						1	9		10.4319/lom.2005.3.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lom.2005.3.1													WOS:000227471100001
J	Rolfhus, KR; Fitzgerald, WF				Rolfhus, KR; Fitzgerald, WF			Mechanisms and temporal variability of dissolved gaseous mercury production in coastal seawater	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Coastal waters are regions of rapid and significant biogeochemical transformations of mercury, but they have received little attention with regards to the mechanisms and seasonality of processes driving measured air-sea fluxes. We examined controls on the net rate of Hg-o production from additions of Hg(II) to dark and light-incubated coastal seawater samples from Long Island Sound, CT. Multiple controls were evident, with approximately 70% of bulk reduction driven photochemically, 20% by microbial mediation, and 10% by uncharacterized dark reduction in the dissolved phase. Positive relations were observed between (1) dark bottle reduction rates and total bacterial abundance and (2) light bottle rates and total solar irradiance. Evasional fluxes were estimated for LIS using a simple model framework, with an estimated 363 pmol Hg-o m(-2) day(-1) delivered to the atmosphere ( similar to 35% of annual inputs to LIS). This value agrees well with an independent estimate, and underscores the geochemical significance and complexity of Hg-o cycling within LIS and other coastal zones.

The one-dimensional hydrodynamic General Lake Model (GLM) is an open-source software and widely used within the limnological research community. Nevertheless, no interface to process the input data and run the model and no tools for an automatic parameter calibration yet exist. Hence, we developed glmGUI, a graphical user interface (GUI) including a toolbox for an autocalibration, parameter sensitivity analysis, and several plot options. The tool is provided as a package for the freely available scientific code language R. The model parameters can be analyzed and calibrated for the simulation output variables water temperature and lake level. The glmGUI package is tested for two sites (lake Ammersee, Germany, and lake Baratz, Italy), distinguishing size, mixing regime, hydrology of the catchment area (i.e., the number of inflows and their runoff seasonality), and climatic conditions. A robust simulation of water temperature for both lakes (Ammersee: RMSE D 1.17 degrees C; Baratz: RMSE = 1.30 degrees C) is achieved by a quick automatic calibration. The quality of a water temperature simulation can be assessed immediately by means of a difference plot provided by glmGUI, which displays the distribution of the spatial (vertical) and temporal deviations. The calibration of the lake-level simulations of lake Ammersee for multiple hydrological inputs including also unknown inflows yielded a satisfactory model fit (RMSE D 0.20 m). This shows that GLM can also be used to estimate the water balance of lakes correctly. The tools provided by glmGUI enable a less time-consuming and simplified parameter optimization within the calibration process. Due to this, i.e., the free availability and the implementation in a GUI, the presented R package expands the application of GLM to a broader field of lake modeling research and even beyond limnological experts.					; Giadrossich, Filippo/L-3496-2016	Vetter, Mark/0000-0003-1849-2034; Poschlod, Benjamin/0000-0003-0247-2514; Giadrossich, Filippo/0000-0002-7546-1632													1991-959X	1991-9603				FEB 13	2020	13	2					565	580		10.5194/gmd-13-565-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-565-2020													WOS:000514151200001

Climatically driven late Pleistocene - Holocene hydrological system transformation and landscape evolution in the eastern periphery of Chuya basin, SE Altai, Russia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Workshop on Palaeohydrological Extreme Events - Evidence and Archives (EX-AQUA)	SEP 26-OCT 01, 2016	Padova, ITALY					This paper presents the results of geological, geomorphological, geochronological investigations and the analysis of the biological composition of deposits within the high-mountainous Boguty river basin. The main stages of landscape evolution during the last 14 ka have been investigated through 32 radiocarbon dates. The area is located in the most arid southeastern part of Russian Altai and constitutes the eastern periphery of the Chuya intermountain depression, and the western side of the Chikhachev range. Postglacial landscape development of the upper reaches of the Chuya River began from the degradation of its vast glaciation. By 14 ka cal BP the glaciers had either completely melted or retreated above 2500 m above sea level. As a result, numerous lakes occupied open places and five types of these basins can be seen in the modern topography. They are large moraine-dammed lakes connected with the Boguty River, while some basins have been dammed by uplifted tectonic blocks and numerous lakes are of thermokarst origin or are small cirque lakes and temporal lakes fed by seasonal meltwater from meteoric, ground water and permafrost degradation. Large moraine-dammed lakes within the Boguty basin were developed before the Holocene. The water filling these basins was controlled by the height of moraine dams and by the depth of the Boguty river incision. The moraine-dammed Low Boguty Lake formed earlier than 10 ka cal BP. Its partial draining and transformation of littoral zone into peat bog took place about 8.2-7.6 ka cal BP. As a result of the analysis of biological composition, four stages of water level fluctuations in the lacustrine-boggy system were recognized. The specific geomorphic and sedimentary features in the middle part of the Boguty basin determined the recurrence of debris flow events at about 8-7; 2.9-1; 0.65 and 0.3 ka cal BP, but the last event occurred in June 2017. The occurrence of fossil forest soils dating to about 11-8.5 ka cal BP and of charcoals (Larix sibirica Ledeb) of about 8.5-7.8 ka cal BP indicate a prolonged period of developing forest vegetation in the Boguty basin, which is currently treeless. In general, the data suggest that in SE Altai the climate in the first half of the Holocene was warmer and more humid in comparison with the modern one. The second half of the Holocene has been characterized by colder climate conditions accompanied by aridity intensification, which became especially pronounced during the last 2-1.5 ka.					; Nepop, Roman/A-6898-2014; Agatova, Anna/AAV-7808-2021	Uspenskaa, Ol'ga/0000-0002-4106-1569; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 10	2020	538				SI		63	79		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.01.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.01.013													WOS:000535803200003

Where invasive species coexist in their non-native range, niche differentiation could allow their persistence at higher levels of abundance. Here, we tested whether there was temporal and/or trophic niche differentiation between two congeneric invasive goby species (Rhinogobius cliffordpopei and Rhinogobius giurinus) in the sublittoral habitat of Lake Erhai (south-west China) through quantifying their diel and seasonal rhythm of locomotion activities, feeding activities and diet composition. Both species displayed two similar diel peaks in activity and two main feeding periods (6:00-10:00 and 18:00-22:00), with rhythms of locomotion and feeding activity not differing significantly between the species in each season. Their diets had a high degree of overlap, being primarily composed of macrozooplankton, aquatic insects and shrimp larvae, with no diel changes across the seasons. Thus, in this habitat, there was no clear temporal or trophic niche differentiation between the invasive congeners, indicating their coexistence with high temporal and trophic overlap. In conjunction with data from the littoral and profundal habitats, the gobies revealed different strategies across the habitats (e.g. spatial segregation, trophic niche differentiation) that minimised their competitive interactions and promoted their coexistence. This suggests that the interactions of invasive fishes during the integration into native communities can be context dependent, varying according to factors including habitat and the availability of food resources.

Stock Assessment of Commercial Fish Species of Lake Victoria	LAKE VICTORIA FISHERIES RESOURCES: RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT IN TANZANIA	Monographiae Biologicae											The fishery of Lake Victoria is dominated by four major commercial species; the introduced Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), native dagaa (Rastrineobola argentea), and haplochromines. Information on the status of these major fish species is limited because there have been few studies on the exact nature of the stock distribution of the species. As such, it has been difficult to trace the trends and fluctuations in abundance, population structure and composition, which are important in planning fisheries management measures. This chapter provides the current status of the fisheries of these four species by reviewing different trends in biomass, catch rates, catch per unit effort and biological indicators using both fisheries dependent and independent data. The results showed that stock abundance fluctuated over the years, with Nile perch and Nile tilapia abundance considerably reduced mainly due to increased fishing pressure, while dagaa and haplochromines increased over time. Seasonality in environmental factors greatly influenced the distribution and abundance of the species, especially Nile perch. Therefore, concerted efforts are needed to avert a declining trend of Nile perch and Nile tilapia so that their fisheries continue to provide benefits sustainably.

Okavango Delta, Botswana	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Tropical floodplain fish populations fluctuate at temporal scales and understanding the variability in these systems will contribute to comprehensive management of these resources. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the dynamics of a floodplain fish assemblage. Data were collected using standard methods between 1999 and 2009 from the delta's panhandle. Various analytical tools (e.g. CCA, SIMPER, ANOVA, etc.) were used to assess fish assemblage dynamics at seasonal and annual scales. ANOVA and cluster analyses showed that the fish assemblage underwent significant changes along the seasonal hydrograph, while index of relative aboundance (%IRI) revealed that the fish assemblage was dominated by Clarias gariepinus, Schilbe intermedius and Hydrocynus vittatus respectively. These species, including Clarias ngamensis and Marcusenius altisambesi, contributed more than 50% to variations in fish assemblage structure along the seasonal hydrograph (based on SIMPER analysis). Furthermore, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed a significant (p = 0.004) association between environmental factors and fish assemblage structure. CCA analysis also showed that spawning for different species is associated with various environmental factors. Annually, results showed that C. gariepinus dominated the fish assemblage during low flood years, while S. intermedius dominated during high flood years. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) showed that the hydrological gradient had a significant effect on fish assemblage structure at an annual scale, while SIMPER analysis established significant variations in fish assemblage structure among years characterized by different hydrological features. One major conclusion we made was that fish assemblages are stochastically different at an annual scale. This study contributes knowledge to floodplain fish ecology and thus enhances fisheries management. (C) 2017 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Using an acoustic telemetry array to assess fish volumetric space use: a case study on impoundments, hypoxia and an air-breathing species (Neoceratodus forsteri)	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Facultative air-breathing fish can persist in hypoxic waters due to their capacity to acquire atmospheric oxygen. Most studies examining responses of air-breathing fish to aquatic hypoxia have occurred under experimental conditions. How air-breathing fish respond to hypoxic conditions in the field has received less attention. Using depth sensor transmitters and an array of acoustic receivers to monitor the facultative air-breathing Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), we investigated habitat preferences and behavioural responses to seasonal hypoxic zones in a riverine impoundment. Three-dimensional (3-D) kernel utilisation distribution (KUD) models revealed that during stratified conditions, lungfish remained above the oxycline, rarely venturing into hypoxic waters, whereas during holomixis lungfish used a wider range of depths. Total volumetric space utilisation did not change significantly during stratified periods, but the distribution of space used changed, constrained by the oxycline. Despite N. forsteri having lungs to supplement oxygen requirements, the presence of a hypoxic zone constrained the core (50% 3-D-KUD) volumetric space used by lungfish to, < 1.6% of the total available space of the study area. With increasing demand for new impoundments in many tropical and subtropical regions, the present study provides insights to how air-breathing fish species may respond to altered riverine conditions from impoundments.					; Roberts, David/W-3004-2019; Dwyer, Ross/IQR-5509-2023; Udyawer, Vinay/L-9432-2019; Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012	Campbell, Hamish/0000-0003-1428-1686; Dwyer, Ross/0000-0003-1136-5489; Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797; Roberts, David/0000-0002-9768-6314													1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	8			SI		1532	1543		10.1071/MF16124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF16124													WOS:000406489100012

In the present study, we focused on the effects of changed water supply for aquaculture ponds on phytoplankton, zooplankton and macrozoobenthos communities during two seasons of rearing common carp. We compared these communities between two types of inflow water: surface sources of water a reservoir pond, two open wells and a small stream and groundwater deep tube well. Significant changes were observed in environmental variables after the introduction of the groundwater source: oxygen concentration and water hardness decreased, while conductivity, phosphorus and un-ionized ammonia increased. Results revealed that all investigated groups, except Mollusca (macrozoobenthos), decreased in species richness, abundance and biomass due to changed water chemistry, but differed in the level of susceptibility. Rotifera and Cladocera were the most affected showing a sharp decline in density and number of species since 66% of species disappeared from the ponds. The abundance of Copepoda was relatively high although significantly lower under new conditions, with adults being more tolerant to changed inflow water than nauplii larvae. Phytoplankton had the highest potential to replace previous species with newcomers more adapted to changed water chemistry, providing 36 immigrant species, whereas 49 became extinct. Although mainly influenced by fish predation, Chironomidae (macrozoobenthos) were undoubtedly affected by changed water chemistry. These results suggest profound changes in three key ecological groups produced by significant changes of important environmental variables and water quality after the shift from surface to groundwater supply.					; Zivic, Ivana/MFH-9267-2025; Stankovic, Marko/MAI-1301-2025; Živić, Miroslav/GMW-7405-2022	Subakov Simic, Gordana/0000-0002-0500-7354; Markovic, Zoran/0000-0003-3703-9921; Zivic, Ivana/0000-0002-4397-9904; Dulic, Zorka/0000-0003-4463-768X; Ciric, Milos/0000-0002-6835-3385; Zivic, Miroslav/0000-0002-0314-5032; Stankovic, Marko/0000-0002-0555-5297													0003-4088	2100-000X					2014	50	2					131	141		10.1051/limn/2014005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2014005													WOS:000336513600004

Weather parameters obtained from selected observational networks are combined with operational high-resolution gridded analyses and forecast products from the United States National Weather Service. Fuel moisture codes and fire behaviour indices in the Fire Weather Index subsystem of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System are computed from these sources for current and forecast conditions. Applications of this Great Lakes Fire and Fuels System are demonstrated for the 2012 fire season. Fuel moisture codes and fire behaviour indices computed from gridded analyses differ from those derived from observations in a manner similar to the analysis errors typical for the underlying weather parameters. Indices that are particularly sensitive to seasonally accumulating precipitation, such as the Drought Code, exhibit the largest differences. The gridded analyses and forecasts provide considerable additional information for fire weather professionals to evaluate weather and fuel state in the region. The potential utility of these gridded analyses and forecasts throughout the continental United States is highlighted.

The cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu were mainly composed of unicellular colony-forming Microcystis and filamentous heterocystous Dolichospermum (formerly known as planktonic species of Anabaena). In contrast to that of Microcystis spp., the fundamental knowledge about diversity, abundance and dynamics of Dolichospermum populations in Lake Taihu is lacking. The present study was conducted to understand genotypic distribution, dynamics and succession of Dolichospermum populations in Lake Taihu. By sequencing 688 internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes of Dolichospermum, we were able to confirm that all the sequences were Dolichospermum rather than Aphanizomenon. 118 different genotypes were identified from the obtained sequences, and two genotypes (W-type and L-type) were found to dominate in the lake, representing 36.6% and 26.2% of the total sequences, respectively. These two dominant genotypes of Dolichospermum displayed the significant seasonal pattern. Stepwise regressions analysis revealed that water temperature was associated with the two dominant genotypes. The combined results implied the possible existence of ecotypes in bloom-forming cyanobacteria, probably triggered by water temperature in the lake. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

RH-6 is located about 600 m from the nearby site of RH-5. The site was first investigated in the 1980s by P. Biagi, whose work outlined the main characteristics of its occupation. It is dated to the sixth and fifth millennia BC and is one of the earliest known sites along the Eastern littoral of the Arabian Peninsula (ELA). During the two seasons of fieldwork, four main sectors were investigated. Sector A, a well-structured settlement, includes post holes cut directly into the bedrock, which define some oval huts and two auxiliary structures, used for fish and shell processing respectively. In Sector B, several graves were documented allowing new thinking about funerary practices. In Sector C, a thorough stratigraphic excavation was carried out in a 2 x 2 m test trench dug to a depth of 1.75 m in order to document the whole sequence of occupation, and Trench North in the northern part of the site. The opportunity of conducting new excavations at the Ra's al-Hamra Neolithic sites is of great importance for scientific research focused on the study of prehistoric fishermen populations that settled along the ELA, and for understanding their earliest mortuary practices and rituals.					; Munoz, Olivia/ABB-6737-2021	Todero, Antonio/0000-0003-4993-1239; 													0308-8421		978-1-905739-80-6				2014	44						235	255																WOS:000381715100019

The aims of this study were to explore the patterns of allocation to different components of the belowground system, and to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on the plasticity of biomass allocation and rhizome morphology We conducted a survey of the clonal plant, Scirpus planiculmis, in the Momoge wetland in northeastern China. Samples were collected at three sites. Site I is the washland of a seasonal lake. Site II is a permanent lake. Site III belongs to the bank of a recessive river. The average number of sampled plants was 686.25 +/- 91.61 per site. We determined the biomass of different plant parts (aboveground part, root, tuber, rhizome) and measured parameters of rhizome morphology (specific rhizome length, average rhizome diameter). Edaphic factors (soil moisture content, organic matter, available phosphorus, available potassium, pH, electrical conductivity) were included as environmental variables. Differences in biomass allocation patterns were analyzed and multiple regression analyses were used to construct a model. The results showed that the structure of the belowground system varied significantly among the three sites. (1) The tubers accounted for the largest share of biomass in plants at site I; (2) plants at site III showed significantly longer rhizomes than those of plants at site II, while the plants at site II showed larger rhizome diameter; (3) pH was the crucial factor affecting biomass allocation and rhizome morphology and was negatively correlated with root biomass of S. planiculmis. Based on these results, we concluded that: (1) greater resource allocation to the storage organ (tuber) reflects a conservative strategy to avoid damage and to maintain the potential for recolonization in a frequently disturbed habitat; (2) the morphological plasticity of the rhizome increases the ability of the clone to acquire resources. Shorter rhizomes enable rapid colonization of the habitat and efficient resource use under strong competition pressure, while longer rhizomes are useful to explore new habitats when local resources are insufficient. Our results suggest that ecological niche of S. planiculmis should be reconsidered. It may be more appropriate to classify S. planiculmis as a facultative salt-alkali plant, although a degree of tolerance to salinity and alkalinity is important for the initial formation of a population.																			1505-2249						2014	62	1					77	88		10.3161/104.062.0108	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/104.062.0108													WOS:000333442000007

Part I: evaluation of remotely-sensed lake surface water temperature observations	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) observations are used to improve the lake surface state in the High Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM), a three-dimensional numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. In this paper, satellite-derived LSWT observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) are evaluated against in-situ measurements collected by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) for a selection of large-to medium-size lakes during the open-water season. Data assimilation of these LSWT observations into the HIRLAM is in the paper Part II. Results show a good agreement between MODIS and in-situ measurements from 22 Finnish lakes, with a mean bias of -1.13 degrees C determined over five open-water seasons (2007-2011). Evaluation of MODIS during an overlapping period (2007-2009) with the AATSR-L2 product currently distributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) shows a mean (cold) bias error of -0.93 degrees C for MODIS and a warm mean bias of 1.08 degrees C for AATSR-L2. Two additional LSWT retrieval algorithms were applied to produce more accurate AATSR products. The algorithms use ESA's AATSR-L1B brightness temperature product to generate new L2 products: one based on Key et al. (1997) and the other on Prata (2002) with a finer resolution water mask than used in the creation of the AATSR-L2 product distributed by ESA. The accuracies of LSWT retrievals are improved with the Key and Prata algorithms with biases of 0.78 degrees C and -0.11 degrees C, respectively, compared to the original AATSR-L2 product (3.18 degrees C).

Seasonal dynamics of zooplankton in a shallow eutrophic, man-made hyposaline lake in Delhi (India): role of environmental factors	HYDROBIOLOGIA					9th Conference of the International-Society-for-Salt-Lake-Research	SEP 26-30, 2005	Curtin Univ Technol, Perth, AUSTRALIA	Int Soc Salt Lake Res	Curtin Univ Technol			Old Fort Lake, a small (1.6 ha), shallow, and recreational water body in Delhi (India) was studied through monthly surveys in two consecutive years (January, 2000-December, 2001). Precipitation is the major source of water for this closed basin lake. In addition, ground water is used for replenishing the lake regularly. This alkaline, hyposaline hard water lake contains very high ionic concentration, especially of nitrates. Based on overall ionic composition, this lake can be categorized as chloride-sulfate alkaline waters with the anion sequence dominated by SO4 (2-) > Cl- > HCO3 (-), and the cations by Mg++ > Ca++. The overall seasonal variability in physicochemical profile was largely regulated by the annual cycle of evaporation and precipitation, whereas the ground water largely influences its water quality. The lake exhibited phytoplankton-dominated turbid state due to dominance of the blue green alga, Microcystis aeruginosa. The persistent cyanobacterial blooms and the elevated nutrient levels are indicative of the cultural eutrophication of the lake. This study focuses on the relative importance of eutrophic vis-A -vis hyposaline conditions in determining the structure and seasonal dynamics of zooplankton species assemblages. A total of 52 zooplankton species were recorded and rotifers dominated the community structure qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The genus Brachionus comprised a significant component of zooplankton community with B. plicatilis as the most dominant species. The other common taxa were B. quadridentatus, B. angularis, Lecane grandis, L. thalera, L. punctata, Mesocyclops sp., and Alona rectangula. Multivariate data analysis techniques, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) along with Monte Carlo Permutation Tests were used to determine the minimum number of environmental factors that could explain statistically significant (P < 0.05) proportions of variation in the species data. The significant variables selected by CCA were NH3-N followed by percent saturation of DO, COD, SS, BOD, NO2-N, rainfall, silicates, and PO4-P. The results indicate that the seasonal succession patterns of the zooplankton species were largely controlled by physicochemical factors related directly or indirectly to the process of eutrophication, whereas hyposaline conditions in the lake determined the characteristic species composition.

Use of a traditional Maori harvesting method, the tau koura, for monitoring koura (freshwater crayfish, Paranephrops planifrons) in Lake Rotoiti, North Island, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Sampling of koura (freshwater crayfish Paranephrops planifrons) to assess population abundance and structure in lakes is often difficult or impractical because of the absence of representative methods. The tau koura is a traditional Maori method used to catch koura in central North Island lakes by placing whakaweku (bundles of bracken fern Pteridium esculentum) on the lake bed that koura then colonise. It has advantages as a monitoring tool over conventional methods, such as baited traps and dive Surveys, as it samples all koura size classes, can be used in turbid waters and at a wide range of depths, and does not require expensive equipment or specialised expertise (e.g., SCUBA). We demonstrate its use to monitor koura populations in Lake Rotoiti (mean depth 32 m), North Island, New Zealand. Application of the method allowed differences in population size structure to be distinguished between a shallow and a moderate depth site within Lake Rotoiti and to discern seasonal breeding patterns.

The fish fauna of three North African lagoons: specific inventories, ecological status and production	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper examines the ecological and biological status of fisheries in three coastal lagoons in the southern Mediterranean region: Merja Zerga in Morocco, Ghar El Melh in Tunisia and Lake Manzala in Egypt. Despite similarities in some ecological characteristics, the three lagoons' respective fisheries show differences in specific composition, in population structure and in their production both in qualitative and quantitative aspects. Thus, in Merja Zerga and Ghar El Melh the fish fauna shows a marine affinity where grey mullet and eels dominate the fish production. In Lake Manzala the ichthyofauna displays a more freshwater affinity with tilapia the dominant group of species. Otherwise, overall fish production at the three sites is regulated by variations in fishing activities, local environments and seasonal conditions. A decrease in fish production was noted over recent years and this is attributed to deteriorating ecological conditions. A variety of factors are implicated including sea communication problems, reduction of the continental (fresh) water supply and increase of pollution causing eutrophication. In addition, over fishing with a continuing increase of fishing effort units, contributes to fisheries decline.

Are watershed and lacustrine controls on planktonic N2 fixation hierarchically structured?	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												N-2 fixation can be an important source of N to limnetic ecosystems and can influence the structure of phytoplankton communities. However, watershed-scale conditions that favor N-2 fixation in lakes and reservoirs have not been well studied. We measured N-2 fixation and lacustrine variables monthly over a 19-month period in Waco Reservoir, Texas, USA, and linked these data with nutrient-loading estimates from a physically based watershed model. Readily available topographic, soil, land cover, effluent discharge, and climate data were used in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ( SWAT) to derive watershed nutrient-loading estimates. Categorical and regression tree ( CART) analysis revealed that lacustrine and watershed correlates of N-2 fixation were hierarchically structured. Lacustrine conditions showed greater predictive capability temporally. For instance, low NO3- concentration (< 25 mu g N/L) and high water temperatures (> 27 degrees C) in the reservoir were correlated with the initiation of N-2 fixation seasonally. When lacustrine conditions were favorable for N-2 fixation, watershed conditions appeared to influence spatial patterns of N-2 fixation within the reservoir. For example, spatially explicit patterns of N-2 fixation were correlated with the ratio of N: P in nutrient loadings and the N loading rate, which were driven by anthropogenic activity in the watershed and periods of low stream flow, respectively. Although N-2 fixation contributed < 5% of the annual N load to the reservoir, 37% of the N load was derived from atmospheric N-2 fixation during summertime when stream flow in the watershed was low. This study provides evidence that watershed anthropogenic activity can exert control on planktonic N-2 fixation, but that temporality is controlled by lacustrine conditions. Furthermore, this study also supports suggestions that reduced in flows may increase the propensity of N-2-fixing cyanobacterial blooms in receiving waters of anthropogenically modified landscapes.

J	Gao, QZ; Wang, ZG				Gao, Quanzhou; Wang, Zhengang			Dissolved inorganic carbon in the Xijiang River: concentration and stable isotopic composition	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is one the major products of chemical weathering of the land, and it is also one of the most active components in the riverine carbon species. Concentration and stable isotopic composition of DIC in the mainstream of the Xijiang River (XJR) and its two tributaries (the Guijiang and Hejiang rivers) were investigated during a hydrological year and a massive flooding. DIC concentration of most selected sections of the XJR system varied from 750 to 2,400 mu M with an average of (1,630 +/- 390) mu M. DIC was significantly diluted in the massive flooding period. The stable isotopic composition of DIC (delta C-13(DIC)) varied from -14.75 to -8.25 parts per thousand [with an average of (-11.19 +/- 1.18) parts per thousand], from 17.22 to -10.65 parts per thousand [with an average of (-13.00 +/- 1.86) parts per thousand], and from -15.94 to -9.71 parts per thousand [with an average of (-12.68 +/- 1.28) parts per thousand] in the mainstream of the XJR, the Guijiang River and the Hejiang River, respectively. This is jointly determined by the outcrop area of carbonate rocks and the properties of soil organic carbon within the catchments. delta C-13(DIC) is less negative in the dry season because of the increasing contribution from karst groundwater and more negative in the wet season because of the increasing contribution from surface soil water. Calcite was saturated sometimes at the mainstream sections of the XJR. Carbonate-sourced DIC contributes 10.32-43.95 % with an average of about (27.69 +/- 6.03) % of the riverine DIC for the XJR. The XJR exports about 4.27 x 10(12) g of DIC in the surveyed year, of which about 83 % occurred in the wet season.					wang, zhengang/A-7659-2010														1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2015	73	1					253	266		10.1007/s12665-014-3420-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3420-5													WOS:000347446100020

S. woodiana was confirmed to be a gonochoristic species with overall sex ratio of 1:1. The examined morphological parameters of Chinese pond mussel spermatozoa, i.e. 42 mu m mean total length; 4.3 mu m mean head length and the maximum size of previtellogenic (34-43 mu m) and vitellogenic oocytes (75-83 mu m) are consistent with values established for closely related members of the Unionidae family. Our results suggest that S. woodiana in the Konin lakes system are able to spawn throughout March to October, with a season of higher reproductive activity in females extending from March to April.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal status of pioneer plants from the mouth of lake Budi, Araucania Region, Chile	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have an important role on the ecosystem stability promoting water and nutrient acquisition by plants and allowing their growth under stress conditions including drought and salinity. This study aimed at describing the colonization of native AMF associated to pioneer plant species growing at the mouth of lake Budi, which receive seasonally marine water. For this, root samples and rhizosphere substrate of Polygonum maritimum, Carpobrotus chilensis, Ambrosia chamissonis, Ammophyla arenaria were collected and analyzed. Mycorrhizal root colonization, spore and hyphal density, and some soil chemical properties (pH, conductivity, organic matter -OM-, and microbial activity) were determined. Results showed that A. Arenaria presented the highest root colonization (53%), mycelium (10 m g(-1)) and AMF spores (300 spores in 100g of substrate) densities, which were highly correlated with an elevated OM content (1.64%; r = 0.53, r = 0.48 y r = 0.87, respectively) and soil microbial activity (3.57 mu g fluorescein g(-1) h(-1); r = 0.89 r = 0.76 and r = 0.53, respectively). On the other hand, a low AMF species richness was found in the rhizospheric soils of all four evaluated plants, finding a total of five AMF species. Nevertheless, one of these corresponds to a new specie (Corymbilomus pacificum), which was associated to A. arenaria. Our results suggest an important role of AMF associated to pioneer plants in saline ecosystems, especially enhancing the establishment of A. arenaria and Amb. chamissonis, which could promote a further nurse effect that allow the establishment of other plant species. AM fungi could be considered as a biotechnological tool since they could be used for stabilization of coastal ecosystems, and in soils under saline or hydric limitations.					; Curaqueo, Gustavo/J-3358-2013; Cornejo, Pablo/B-1039-2015; Oehl, Fritz/JXW-7733-2024; Aguilera, Paula/AAV-1294-2020	Meier, Sebastian/0000-0003-3491-5367; Curaqueo, Gustavo/0000-0001-9946-737X; Oehl, Fritz/0000-0003-1492-7985; Cornejo, Pablo/0000-0003-2124-3100; 													0718-9508	0718-9516					2015	15	1					142	152																WOS:000359004700012

Our data confirmed seasonal differences in the Hg concentrations in fish, but the causes for that may vary depending on fish species. Length (pike and perch) and age (perch and whitefish) were the strongest explanatory factors for the Hg fluctuations. Fish caught in December (pike and whitefish) had the highest Hg concentrations, while the concentrations in May were higher than in September for all 3 species, statistically significant for perch (P<0.0001) and close to significant for pike (P=0.07). Higher delta N-15 signatures were found in December and May compared with September, but these differences might be related to fish body size variations. There was a large range of delta C-13 signatures in the investigated fish, but no significant differences between seasons neither within nor between species.					; Fjeld, Eirik/K-9241-2013	Fjeld, Eirik/0000-0003-0137-6918; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2015	74	1					21	30		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.918	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.918													WOS:000352405900003
J	Palaniswamy, R; Manoharan, S; Mohan, A				Palaniswamy, Rani; Manoharan, S.; Mohan, Anjana			Characterisation of tropical reservoirs in Tamil Nadu, India in terms of plankton assemblage using multivariate analysis	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												The ecological status of reservoirs in Tamil Nadu, India was studied in view of their importance in culture based fisheries. The abundance and distribution pattern of plankton assemblages with respect to important water parameters was selected to characterise the reservoirs. Sampling was carried out seasonally in 22 reservoirs widely ranging in trophic state, during 1993 to 2004. A definite distinction was observed between Western Ghats (WG), rain shadow (RS) and plain land reservoirs (PL) based on plankton communities and environmental factors analysed. Western Ghats reservoirs lying at the head stream of rivers tend to show chemically oligotrophic to mesotrophic status with characteristic dominance of phytoplankters viz., chlorophyta, Selenastrum spp., Ankistrodesmus spp., bacillariophyta, Navicula spp., Nitzshia spp. and Synedra spp. and zooplankton, rotifer, Brachionus spp. and copepod, Diaptomus spp. Eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic status with dominant presence of cyanophyta, Microcystis aeruginosa in all the seasons and lesser presence of Spirulina spp. was observed in many plain land reservoirs while others with low anthropogenic pressure were sub-dominant with bacillariophyta, Nitzshia spp., Synedra spp. and Navicula spp. and chlorophyta Scenedesmus spp. and Selenastrum spp. Blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa occurred in shallow plain reservoirs receiving agricultural, industrial and municipal run-off during monsoon. Rain shadow reservoirs depicted early eutrophy stage as estimated through Carlssons Trophic State Index, represented by species of two groups, chlorophyceae and myxophyceae, distribution being influenced mostly by habitat characteristics. Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that secchi disc transparency and nutrients were important variables determining the ecological status of the reservoirs. The overall division of the reservoirs is explained by species environmental relationship using BIOENV (Primer 6), which described the positive correlation of temperature, specific conductivity and hardness to plankton composition and numerical abundance. Some plain reservoirs move out of their group to assume a solitary position exhibiting different plankton composition with respect to hydrological characteristics.																			0970-6011						2015	62	3					1	13																WOS:000365111700001

Spatial mapping of evapotranspiration over Devils Lake basin with SEBAL: application to flood mitigation via irrigation of agricultural crops	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												Excessive precipitation since 1993 has produced extensive flooding in the Devils Lake basin in northeastern North Dakota, USA. Irrigation of agricultural crops has been proposed as a flood mitigation tool. Ten test fields were equipped with center pivot irrigation systems to compare test field evapotranspiration (ET) with ET for crops in the predominantly nonirrigated basin. An irrigation scheduling analysis indicated 2006 was a favorable year to estimate the maximum ET gains achievable via irrigation. An ET map for 2006 using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) for 54 % of the basin, and land use and soil survey data, was used to compare ET estimates at the test fields with ET estimates across the study area. May-September ET was estimated by SEBAL as 394 mm for wheat and 435 mm for corn across the study area, while corn ET at irrigated test sites was 452 mm. Because the 17-mm ET advantage by irrigating corn was substantially smaller than the 41-mm ET advantage for corn versus wheat, we conclude widespread irrigation development to mitigate flooding is not justified. Coarse-textured soils exhibited some seasonal ET deficits, but their small areal extents and parcel sizes offer virtually no opportunity for flood mitigation.

J	Thomas, BC; Martin, JE				Thomas, Blaine C.; Martin, Jonathan E.			A synoptic climatology and composite analysis of the Alberta clipper	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Surface and upper-air analyses from the ECMWF Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere ( TOGA) dataset are used to construct a climatology of 177 Alberta clippers over 15 boreal cold seasons ( October-March) from 1986/87 to 2000/01. The Alberta clipper ( hereafter simply clipper) occurs most frequently during December and January and substantially less frequently during October and March. These cyclones generally move southeastward from the lee of the Canadian Rockies toward or just north of Lake Superior before progressing eastward into southeastern Canada or the northeastern United States, with less than 10% of the cases in the climatology tracking south of the Great Lakes. Characteristics of the structure and evolution of clippers during a 36-h period leading up to departure of the cyclone from the lee of the Canadian Rockies and a 60-h period after departure as the cyclone traverses central and eastern North America are examined through composite analyses. Over the course of the predeparture period, a cyclone over the Gulf of Alaska approaches the west coast of North America, and through its interaction with the mountainous terrain of western North America spawns a surface lee trough, characterized by a thermal ridge at 850 hPa, to the east of the Canadian Rockies. This thermal ridge dampens considerably as the composite clipper moves into central North America away from the immediate lee of the Canadian Rockies. The composite clipper system evolves from a lee cyclone with its nonclassical thermal structure to a more classically structured midlatitude cyclone as it moves through central and eastern North America largely as a result of rotation of the low-level thermal gradient and the increasing westward tilt with height of the composite clipper over the last 36 h of the postdeparture period. The thermal gradient rotation is dynamically linked to convergence of the along-isentrope component of the Q vector and thus to the ascent that sustains the clipper and creates some of its characteristic sensible weather elements. Such dynamical forcing is a direct consequence of the persistent westward displacement of the 500-hPa vorticity maximum with respect to the composite clipper sea level pressure minimum that characterizes the postdeparture period.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				APR	2007	22	2					315	333		10.1175/WAF982.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF982.1													WOS:000245921100007

Gas phase, particle phase and precipitation concentrations of 22 OCP species, including chlordanes, DDTs, HCHs, endosulfan I and II, aldrin and diedrin, were measured. OCPs are found predominantly in the gas phase in all seasons, representing over 95% of the total air concentrations. Most of the pesticides measured display highest concentrations at urban sites (Camden and New Brunswick), although in many cases the differences in geometric mean concentrations are not statistically significant. The relationship of gas-phase partial pressure with temperature was examined using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation; significant temperature dependencies were found for all OCPs, except aldrin. Atmospheric depositional fluxes (gas absorption into water + dry particle deposition + wet deposition) to the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary of selected OCPs were estimated at NJADN sites. Atmospheric concentrations of dieldrin, aldrin and the HCHs are similar to those measured by the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) in the Great Lake Region. In contrast, concentrations of DDTs, chlordanes and heptachlor are higher in the Mid-Atlantic compared to the Great Lakes, suggesting that the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary receives higher fluxes of these chemicals than the Great Lakes.

Trend assessment for daily snow depths with changepoint considerations	ENVIRONMETRICS												This paper develops methods to estimate a long-term trend in a daily snow depth record. The methods use a storage equation model for the daily snow depths that allows for seasonality, support set features (snow depths cannot be negative), correlation, and mean level shift changepoint features. Changepoints can occur in snow processes whenever observing stations move or station instrumentation is changed; they are critical features to consider when estimating a long-term trend. A likelihood objective function is developed for the storage model and is used to estimate model parameters. Genetic algorithms are used to optimize a minimum descriptive length model selection criterion that estimates the changepoint numbers and locations. The methods are applied in the analysis of a daily series recorded near Warm Lake, Idaho, from 1948 to 2009.

Changing sedimentation patterns due to historical land-use change in Frenchman's Bay, Pickering, Canada: evidence from high-resolution textural analysis	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This study examines the anthropogenic alteration of sedimentation in Frenchman's Bay in Lake Ontario, using high-resolution particle size analysis in two 200 cm cores. Lithofacies were determined using the particle size data of both the terrigenous sediment and terrigenous sediment + diatom fractions. Terrigenous particle size data from the centre of the lagoon provided the most representative record of anthropogenic impacts. Three distinctive lithofacies were recognized: (1) a Natural Wetland (NW) lithofacies (106-200 cm) had an average mean particle size of 49.4 mu m, a mode of 29.4 mu m and an average standard deviation of 119.1 mu m; (2) an Agricultural and Deforestation (AD) lithofacies (40-105 cm) had a statistically significant lower average mean (30.8 mu m), mode (13.5 mu m), and standard deviation (48.5) mu m; (3) an Urbanized (U) lithofacies (0-40 cm) showed a continued trend towards smaller particle sizes with an average mean of 21.2 mu m, a mode of 9.4 mu m, and an average standard deviation of 32.7 mu m. The lithofacies correlated with previously identified trends in thecamoebian biofacies and magnetic susceptibility data showing post-colonial lagoon eutrophication and increased overland soil erosion. The up-core trend towards finer and less variable particle sizes is attributed to erosion of fine-grained watershed sediments (glacial Lake Iroquois silts and clay) during land-clearance and modification of natural drainage patterns. The influx of silts and clays into the lagoon is also recorded by increased sediment accumulation rates and a reduction in seasonal sediment variability in the wetland. Based on the Pb-210 dates, sedimentation rates increased at 1850 +/- 56 AD (AD lithofacies) and suggest an exponentially increasing trend in accumulation rates. Increasing sedimentation rates can be attributed to the progressive loss of native vegetation and intensified erosion of Lake Iroquois deposits via stream and hillslope erosion. Ecologically, the increased input of fine-grained sediments into the wetland has resulted in reduced water clarity and has altered the wetland substrate contributing to wetland loss in Frenchman's Bay.					; van Hengstum, Pete/AHC-5291-2022	Boyce, Joseph I./0000-0001-9083-6458; van Hengstum, Pete/0000-0002-1125-2858; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAY	2007	37	4					603	618		10.1007/s10933-006-9057-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9057-y													WOS:000246204200011

For this purpose a pilot plant was set up to add these biocides continuously to prefiltered lake water flowing into three different basins. During three seasonal experiments, short-term in vivo tests (with plant, fish and molluscs) and in vitro tests (with bacteria, yeast and human cells) were carried out to evaluate the formation of genotoxic disinfection by-products (DBPs). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to identify DBPs produced during the different treatments, microbiological analyses were performed to test the biocidal activity of the disinfectants, and chemical analyses were carried out to evaluate the quality of the water. The pilot drinking water plant under study was useful in studying the toxicity and genotoxicity of disinfected drinking water with this combined chemical/biotoxicological approach. This paper describes the setting up of the pilot plant and sets out/reports the results of the microbiological and chemical analyses. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, the temporal variation and risk assessment of MP pollution in the surface water of the Wei River, a typical seasonal river in northern China, were quantified. The number abundance of MPs in the dry season was significantly higher than that in the wet season (p < 0.05). Fiber was the most abundant type of MP in both dry and wet seasons. Infrared spectrometer and Raman spectroscopy identification showed that polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were the major polymers found in both dry and wet seasons, and the mixture of different MP polymers was more diverse in the dry season. The risk assessment showed that the average pollution load index (PLI) and risk quotient (RQ) were 2.10 and 1.19 in the dry season, which significantly decreased to 1.25 and 0.74, respectively, in the wet season (p < 0.05). In total, the results from this study highlight the characteristics of seasonal rivers that influence the temporal distribution and risk assessment of microplastics, providing scientific reference for policymakers and river managers to effectively deal with MP pollution.

To solve nitrogen pollution in sugarcane areas, exploring the nitrogen output characteristics of agricultural watersheds in crop fields becomes necessary. Therefore, the objective of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of nitrogen output during typical rainfall events in different sugarcane growth stages in a southern tropical watershed in China. Dynamic monitoring of runoff and nitrogen concentration was carried out for four rainfall events and compared among four sugarcane growth stages (Establishment; Vegetative growth; Grand growth; Ripening) during the growing season of 2018 in the Nala watershed, Kelan Reservoir, Guangxi, China. The results showed that the total dissolved nitrogen flux of the 4 rainfall events ranged from 0.08 to 9.88 kg.hm(-2) for the different growth stages. Nitrate nitrogen was the main component of the total flux, accounting between 75.7 and 92.1% of the total dissolved nitrogen while ammonium nitrogen accounted between 1.80 and 5.26% of the total flux for the 4 rainfall events. Total dissolved nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen were significantly and negatively correlated with runoff (p < 0.05), while total dissolved nitrogen concentration did not correlate with runoff. The incipient scouring effect of total dissolved nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen was not noticeable. The concentration of total dissolved nitrogen in the Nala watershed was inferior to class V water quality standard, indicating water eutrophication danger. The study showed that nitrogen nutrient inflow into the river was promoted by N-fertilization time and rainfall. Therefore, reasonably reducing N-fertilization dose and post-rain fertilization could effectively reduce nitrogen inflow into rivers and avoid the intensification of eutrophication in sugarcane areas. We recommend multiple years of studies to verify the possible impacts of differences in weather conditions.

However, mitigating this issue proves challenging due to the intricate nature of soil properties and environmental factors. Here, during the rainy season in the Lake Erhai basin, we collected and analyzed soil profile samples, 35 topsoil (0-20 cm) samples, and more than 300 field baseflow samples. Our objective was to explore the influences of soil properties, field baseflow, and agricultural management measures on the spatiotemporal migration of nutrients. The results indicated that the concentration of soil organic matter (SOM) has a significant impact on the spatial patterns of nutrient distribution in sandy soil. Consequently, this leads to a substantial reduction in the potential for nutrient loss in the Lake Erhai basin. The vegetable-field baseflow exhibited the highest concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus when subjected to high fertilization and flood irrigation. The concentrations of TN and TP in baseflow increase by a factor of 2 and 7.7, respectively, during rainfall compared to periods of no rainfall. Optimizing agricultural measures, such as replacing chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers and modifying irrigation methods to enhance the organic content of sandy soil and minimize baseflow elution, has a beneficial impact on mitigating agricultural non-point source pollution in the Erhai Lake basin. The research results can enable us to have a more systematic understanding of the problem of non-point source pollution in the Erhai River Basin, and provide a theoretical basis for developing targeted agricultural non-point source pollution mitigation plans. Simultaneously, optimizing agricultural management models to strike a balance between agricultural economic development and ecological protection issues holds significant practical significance for managers.

According to existing databases, Lithuanian wetlands are represented by: suo wetlands, peatlands, lentic, lotic, and marine/coastal wetlands. The harmonisation of the Ramsar classification system with the traditional classifications of Lithuanian wetlands is emphasised. The distribution of the distinguishable wetland types is identified. The following Ramsar inland and man-made wetland types are found in Lithuania: non-forested and forested peatlands (9.9% area of Lithuania), seasonal pools on mineral soils and tree-dominated wetlands (>13.92% area of Lithuania), permanent freshwater lakes (1.27% area of Lithuania), permanent freshwater marshes/pools (0.08% area of Lithuania), aquaculture ponds (0.18% area of Lithuania), ponds (0.16% area of Lithuania), water storage areas (0.3% area of Lithuania), excavations (0.04% area of Lithuania), permanent rivers/streams/creeks, seasonal streams/creeks (similar to 0.69% area of Lithuania), canals and drainage ditches (0.11% area of Lithuania), and permanent inland deltas (0.01% area of Lithuania). The authors identified the following types of Ramsar marine/coastal wetlands in Lithuania: permanent shallow marine waters (0.09% area of Lithuania), sand, shingle or pebble shores (94 km marine and 77.89 km lagoon shores), coastal freshwater lagoons (0.52% area of Lithuania).					; Pileckas, Marijus/HPC-5892-2023; Linkevičienė, Rita/HGD-5800-2022	Pileckas, Marijus/0000-0003-4014-8926; Simanauskiene, Rasa/0000-0002-9802-6342; Linkeviciene, Rita/0000-0001-5817-4458													0067-3064					JUN	2012	25	1					33	44		10.5200/baltica.2012.25.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.5200/baltica.2012.25.03													WOS:000305926600003

Linkage between land use patterns and sediment phosphorus sorption behaviors along shoreline of a Chinese large shallow lake (Lake Chaohu)	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												To test the relationship between phosphorus buffering capacity in sediments of littoral zone and land use, seasonal samples were taken from the soils representing different patterns of land use, together with the littoral zone sediments, along shoreline in Lake Chaohu. There existed significantly positive relationships between equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC0) and degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS) defined as ratios of Olsen-P, algae available phosphorus (AAP) and inorganic phosphorus (IP) to maximum sorption capacity (Q(max)). So, some easily accessible P parameters especially DPS were indicative of EPC0 in the sediments. Furthermore, the contents of IP, total phosphorus (TP) and organic matter (OM) in the sediments were significantly related to those in the soils. Therefore, the soils could provide the littoral zone with IP either directly or indirectly through TP input; it also provided the Olsen-P through the OM input, as evidenced by the relationship between Olsen-P and OM. It meant that the enhanced OM would enlarge the DPS. On the other hand, the increase in OM paralleled with the increases in Q(max), which lower the DPS simultaneously. Thus, the OM modified sediment phosphorus sorption behaviors in complicated manners. Finally, the soil covered by Fleabane was coupled with the sediment whose EPC0 values were lower and further decreased with strong diffusion from the soils after heavy rains. Hence, shoreline soil may input TP including IP and OM into the lake and alter the DPS together with EPC0 thereby regulating the sediment functions to act as sink or source of phosphorus.																			1961-9502						2011		403							06	10.1051/kmae/2011067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2011067													WOS:000299310800006

Channel bars in the lower reach of the Stung Sen River that emerge in the dry season were classified into type A (lateral bars), type B (point bars), type C (concave-bank benches) and type D (diagonal and island bars, or fluvial dunes) based on Nagumo et al.'s previous study. Type B, type C, and type D channel bars were at our study sites of SEN-01 and SEN-02, about 83 and 77 km from the river mouth respectively. Computation of water surface profiles showed that sediment transport capacity of the Stung Sen River decreased abruptly after the peak flow stage because of the backwater effect from Lake Tonle Sap during the decreasing flow stage. Our observations suggest that alternating layers of sand and silt to clay layers accumulate to form type C channel bars, corresponding to changes in sediment transport capacity controlled by backwater effects from Lake Tonle Sap and by changes in flow depths and associated slackwater systems. The accumulation of alternating silt and sand layers of type B channel bars results from lateral sediment transportation that is accelerated with an increase of secondary flow, whereas development of type D channel bars is related to bedload mobility.

Management of the Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens population in the lower St Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada) from the 1910s to the present	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					6th International Symposium on Sturgeons	OCT 25-30, 2009	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA					The main objective of this paper is to show that a well-managed lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens population can support a high and sustainable commercial catch, even in the Great Lakes drainage where the species has nowadays become rare. In a 350-km long un-fragmented stretch of the lower St Lawrence River located between Montreal and downstream Quebec City, with declared annual catches of 150 tonnes, the lake sturgeon population was considered overexploited by a governmental scientific committee in 1987 on the basis of high annual mortality rates (17-25% for age groups 14-31), unbalanced age structure, deficit of reproductive potential and commercial catch yields well over 1.5 kg ka(-1). A first management plan implemented in 1987 failed to reduce the catch and provide more protection to the spawning stock. During the 1990s, the declared catch of the 76 commercial fishermen kept increasing over 200 tonnes. The age at the recruitment of the 20-cm-mesh gill-nets shifted towards older fish, indicating a decrease in the numbers of younger fish. In the population, sub-adult abundance decreased by 60%, as well as the year-class strength and the abundance of the females on the largest known spawning ground. In 2000, a stronger management plan was then enforced in order to adapt the total catch to the potential of the resource. The commercial catch was reduced by 60% in 3 years and an individual code-bar plastic tag and a code-bar weight declaration coupon were established to control its application. The fishing season was also shortened. Ten years later, we are confident in maintaining the actual commercial fishery because the commercial catch is now much lower (80 tonnes) and is more effectively controlled, the abundance of juvenile lake sturgeon increased throughout the St Lawrence River and the regular yearly production of cohorts has been demonstrated. Restrictive management measures, close supervision of landings combined with periodic monitoring of the population are key elements in managing this long-lived species. We also emphasize the importance of preventing any further fragmentation of this portion of 350 km of fluvial habitat as well as to maintain habitat quality to ensure the sustainability of this fishery.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2011	27	2					405	410		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01727.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01727.x													WOS:000288864600038
J	Hessen, DO				Hessen, Dag O.			Determinants of seston C : P-ratio in lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The ratio of carbon to phosphorus (C : P) in seston is a major determinant of energy transfer in aquatic food webs and may vary more than an order of magnitude owing to various extrinsic and intrinsic factors. In this study, the determinants of C : P-ratios in lake particulate matter (seston) was assessed in 112 Norwegian lakes, covering a C : P (atomic ratio) from 24 to 1842 (mean 250). 2. No overall effects of lake area, season or latitude on C : P was detected. Particulate P, but not particulate C, correlated with C : P. Multivariate analysis including a range of lake properties revealed total dissolved P, as the major determinant of sestonic C : P, with the fraction of detritus in total seston, chlorophyll or Secchi depth and lake colour as significant contributors. Together these parameters explained 30% of observed variance if using dissolved P and 81% if using total P as input variable to the multivariate model. 3. Chlorophyll and Secchi depth were highly correlated and substitutable in the analysis. Phytoplankton community composition did not affect seston C : P, probably reflecting the fact that live phytoplankton generally contributed < 25% of the seston pool. 4. Total P correlated positively with C : P and is the key determinant of phytoplankton biomass and thus Secchi depth; the latter parameters contributed negatively to seston C : P, probably owing to increased light attenuation. These lake data thus support the light : nutrient ratio hypothesis, i.e. that high light and low P cause skewed uptake ratios of C to P. 5. Zooplankton biomass in general and Daphnia biomass in particular, was negatively correlated with C : P, probably reflecting a negative impact of poor seston quality at high C : P.

J	Agasild, H; Noges, T				Agasild, H; Noges, T			Cladoceran and rotifer grazing on bacteria and phytoplankton in two shallow eutrophic lakes: in situ measurement with fluorescent microspheres	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Metazooplankton grazing on bacteria and on the phytoplankton of various sizes was estimated in shallow eutrophic lakes Kaiavere and Vortsjarv (Estonia) by in situ feeding experiments with fluorescent microspheres (diameters 0.5 mu m for bacteria and 3, 6 and 24 mu m for phytoplankton). Zooplankton community composition, abundance and food density were important factors determining grazing rates in these lakes. Cladocerans and rotifers filtering rates (FR) and ingestion rates (IR) on bacteria and phytoplankton were several times higher in Lake Kaiavere where bacterivorous rotifers and Daphnia contributed more to zooplankton assemblage. While cladocerans were generally the main phytoplankton consumers, both lakes differed with respect to the groups of bacterivores. Based on consumption of fluorescent microspheres, the metazooplankton grazing rates were relatively low and had low impact on production and standing stock of bacteria and ingestible phytoplankton (< 30 mu m). On average, 0.5 and 0.1% of standing stock of bacteria and 2.6 and 1.0% of standing stock of ingestible phytoplankton was grazed daily by metazooplankton in lakes Kaiavere and Vortsjarv, respectively. That corresponded to daily grazing of 4.1% of the bacterial production and 0.43% of the total primary production (PP) by metazooplankton in Lake Kaiavere compared with 4.3 and 0.06% in Lake Vortsjarv, respectively. The results suggest that the majority of consumption of the bacterial and phytoplankton PP is most likely channelled through the microbial loop.

J	Rückert, G; Giani, A				Rueckert, Gabrielavon; Giani, Alessandra			Biological interactions in the plankton community of a tropical eutrophic reservoir: is the phytoplankton controlled by zooplankton?	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Phytoplankton regulation by zooplankton might be weaker in tropical systems than is generally found in temperate regions. In this study, we evaluated the potential effect of grazing by three microcrustaceans, Daphnia laevis, Moina micrura and Thermocyclops decipiens, on the phytoplankton community of Pampulha reservoir, a small tropical eutrophic reservoir. Four experiments were carried out over a season under laboratory conditions with the natural phytoplankton community. Selectivity coefficient and filtration rates were measured for each zooplankton species, and phytoplankton abundance was estimated. The three crustaceans grazed selectively upon the same phytoplankton species, although the species selected were seasonally different between the experiments. Nevertheless, most algal species did not show a significant decrease due to grazing. Only Daphnia laevis, in one of the experiments, produced evident changes in the structure of the dominant groups of the phytoplankton community. The abundance of total phytoplankton available for the microcrustaceans (1.00-4.49 mg C L(-1)) was always above the threshold food concentration values reported in the literature. Therefore, grazer production could be supported almost exclusively by phytoplankton during most of the year. Food abundance was probably the reason for the almost undetectable top-down effect by the microcrustaceans and the lack of differences among them. These observations provide evidence of the inability of zooplankton to shape and control the phytoplankton community in this tropical system. It is possible that other herbivores such as fish play the role of main consumers of the algal community.					von Rückert, Gabriela/JCN-8772-2023; Giani, Alessandra/H-9764-2012	Giani, Alessandra/0000-0002-2524-8534													0142-7873					OCT	2008	30	10					1157	1168		10.1093/plankt/fbn065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbn065													WOS:000260140300007

The objective of this work was to study the influence of environmental heterogeneities on vector bionomics and malaria epidemiology. Mosquitoes were collected when landing on human volunteers and by pyrethrum spray catches. In the parasitological survey, blood samples were taken from a cohort of schoolchildren under 9 years during each entomology survey. Seven anopheline species were collected: Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles gambiae M form, Anopheles funestus, Anopheles pharoensis, Anopheles coustani, Anopheles wellcomei and Anopheles rufipes. A. arabiensis, A.funestus and A. pharoensis were predominant in the low valley of the Senegal River, A. funestus in the Guiers Lake area and A. arabiensis in the low valley of Ferlo. Mosquito populations' dynamics varied temporally depending on the rainy season for each zone. The anthropophilic rates varied between 6 and 76% for A. gambiae s.l. and 23 and 80% for A. funestus. Only 4/396 A. pharoensis and 1/3076 A. funestus tested carried Plasmodium falciparum CS antigen. These results suggest the implication of A. pharoensis in malaria transmission. The related entomological inoculation rates were estimated to 10.44 in Mbilor and 3 infected bites in Gankette Balla and were due, respectively, to A. pharoensis and A.,funestus. Overall, 1636 thick blood smears were tested from blood samples taken from schoolchildren with, respectively, a parasite and gametocyte average prevalence of 9 and 0.9%. The parasite prevalence was uniformly low in Mbilor and Gankette Balla whereas; it increased in September (16%) and then remained stable in December and March (22%) in Mboula where malaria transmission was not perceptible. However, significant differences were observed over time for parasite prevalence in Mbilor and Mboula villages whereas; it was only in Gankette Balla village where gametocyte prevalence was significantly different over time. Our study demonstrates the influence of ecological changes resulted from dams implementation in the Senegal River on the composition of vectorial system, malaria transmission and epidemiology. Such changes should be thoroughly surveyed in order to prevent any possible malaria outbreak in the Senegal River Basin. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Infection paradox: High abundance but low impact of freshwater benthic viruses	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The discovery of an abundant and diverse virus community in oceans and lakes has profoundly reshaped ideas about global carbon and nutrient fluxes, food web dynamics, and maintenance of microbial biodiversity. These roles are exerted through massive viral impact on the population dynamics of heterotrophic bacterio-plankton and primary producers. We took advantage of a shallow wetland system with contrasting microhabitats in close proximity to demonstrate that in marked contrast to pelagic systems, viral infection, determined directly by transmission electron microscopy, and consequently mortality of prokaryotes were surprisingly low in benthic habitats in all seasons. This was true even though free viruses were abundant throughout the year and bacterial infection and mortality rates were high in surrounding water. The habitats in which we found this pattern include sediment, decomposing plant litter, and biofilms on aquatic vegetation. Overall, we detected viruses in only 4 of a total of similar to 15,000 bacterial cells inspected in these three habitats; for comparison, nearly 300 of similar to 5,000 cells suspended in the water column were infected. The strikingly low incidence of impact of phages in the benthos may have important implications, since a major portion of microbial biodiversity and global carbon and nutrient turnover are associated with surfaces. Therefore, if failure to infect benthic bacteria is a widespread phenomenon, then the global role of viruses in controlling microbial diversity, food web dynamics, and biogeochemical cycles would be greatly diminished compared to predictions based on data from planktonic environments.

Relative importance of CO2 recycling and CH4 pathways in lake food webs along a dissolved organic carbon gradient	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Terrestrial ecosystems export large quantities of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to aquatic ecosystems. This DOC can serve as a resource for heterotrophic bacteria and influence whether lakes function as sources or sinks of atmospheric CO2. However, it remains unclear as to how terrestrial carbon moves through lake food webs. We addressed this topic by conducting a comparative lake survey in the northeastern U.S. along a gradient of terrestrial-derived DOC. We used naturally occurring carbon stable isotopes Of CO2, particulate organic matter (POM), and crustacean zooplankton, as well as gas measurements and culture-independent assessments of microbial community composition to make inferences about the flow of terrestrial carbon in lake food webs. Stable isotope ratios of POM and zooplankton decreased with DOC and were often depleted in C-13 relative to terrestrial carbon, suggesting the importance of an isotopically light carbon source. It has been proposed that the incorporation of biogenic methane (CH4) into plankton food webs would account for such trends in stable isotope ratios, but we found weak evidence for this hypothesis, on the basis of relationships of CH4, methanogenic archaebacteria, and methanotrophic bacteria in our lakes. Instead, our results are consistent with the view that phytoplankton increase their use of heterotrophically respired CO2 with increasing concentrations of terrestrialderived DOC. The effect of this CO2 recycling can be detected in the stable isotope composition of crustacean zooplankton, suggesting that the direct transfer of terrestrial DOC inputs to higher trophic levels may be relatively inefficient.

Food used by two sympatric species of Moenkhausia (Characiformes, Characidae), in a stream of center-western Brazil	IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA												Food used by two sympatric species of Moenkhausia (Characiformes, Characidae), in a stream of center-western Brazil. This study evaluated the seasonality in the diet of Moenkhausia dichroura (Kner, 1858) and M. sanctaefilomenae (Steindachner, 1907), sympatric species of the Cancela stream, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Regardless of the seasonal period, allochthonous food source predominated in the diet of both species (>50% of all items consumed) and among these terrestrial insects were the dominant resource. However, aquatic insects were important in the diet of M. dichroura as well. Hymenoptera (Formicidae) was the dominant item to both species, thus they were characterized as terrestrial insectivorous. The restricted diet of these species is confirmed by the trophic niche breadth, whose values were in general low: Ba=0.26 to M. dichroura in both periods and Ba=0.41 and 0.38 in the dry and rainy period, respectively, to M. sanctaefilomenae. The feeding overlap was high in the rainy period (O-jk=0.75) and intermediate in the dry period (O-jk=0.41), showing that the food partitioning between species was larger in this period.					hahn, norma/D-5736-2016; Zaia Alves, Gustavo Henrique/C-9347-2019; Alves, Gustavo/JBJ-7206-2023	Zaia Alves, Gustavo Henrique/0000-0002-9233-2824; 													0073-4721	1678-4766				SEP 30	2010	100	3					201	206		10.1590/S0073-47212010000300003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0073-47212010000300003													WOS:000285508400003

The Chao Phraya estuary represents a steady-state source of these tracers and we looked at their horizontal distribution on a transect leading away from the estuary into the Gulf. The isotopes Rn-222 and Ra-224 have very similar half-lives and are affected in the same manner by mixing processes but only radon will emanate to the atmosphere. We thus are able to estimate the radon air-water exchange rate from the difference in the slopes of the Rn-222 and Ra-224 horizontal distributions. Estimated gas exchange velocities (k) based on our results were 1.1 cm hr(-1) in the dry season (January 2004) and 2.1 cm hr(-1) during the wet season (July 2004). These rates agreed reasonably well with some theoretical models developed for lakes, estuaries and coastal systems.

This study aimed to identify the meteorological drivers of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a), sampled seasonally over a period of 12 years (2001-2013) in Lake Mangueira, a large shallow subtropical lake in southern Brazil. The lake is 90 km long and 3-10 km wide with a mean depth of 3 m and is oligo-mesotrophic and highly affected by wind action. In general, non-parametric multiplicative regression analysis identified wind direction, radiation, and the Oceanic Nino Index as the main drivers of variation in chlorophyll a. Notably, ENSO periods caused changes in physical, chemical, and meteorological parameters, including conductivity, total suspended solids, total and dissolved nitrogen, alkalinity, soluble reactive silica, wind speed, and precipitation. Phytoplankton biomass showed significant differences between ENSO periods and the periods without events, occurring in the highest values during La Nina years. This study showed that meteorological variables can significantly influence productivity patterns, indicating the importance of including them in limnological studies.

The degree to which this measure may predict long term performance is uncertain. In order to assess the relationship of this enzyme to long term growth and ion homeostasis, a cohort of Atlantic salmon hatchery smolts was used in a controlled environment with no salinity perturbations. In May 2006, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity from 940 individually PIT tagged, Penobscot River smolts (USFWS, Green Lake National Fish Hatchery, Maine, United States) was measured immediately prior to isothermal transfer from freshwater to 32 ppt seawater. From the observed range of activities, individuals were classified as having "low", "middle", or "high" enzyme activity levels. Individual size (fork length and mass) was recorded on days 0, 1, 3, and 14 and monthly for four months. Growth rates over four time periods were calculated for individual fish maintained until the end of the experiment. Gill Na+,K+-ATPase activities were also measured from a subset of sampled fish. All groups effectively osmoregulated as evidenced by minor perturbations in plasma osmolyte levels. Apart from initial weight loss on transfer, fish grew throughout the experiment, however, there were no differences (fish size, growth rate, and gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity in seawater) among groups with initially different gill Na+,K+-ATPase activities (prior to seawater entry). While gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity may be predictive of performance during the acute phase of acclimation (first few days), typical variation in this enzyme, expressed in freshwater at the peak of smolting, does not appear to be predictive of long-term growth in seawater.

Seasonal and ontogenetic variation in diel vertical migration of Chaoborus flavicans and its effect on depth-selection behavior of other zooplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We analyzed diel vertical migration ( DVM) of zooplankton in June, July, and September in Lake Karnsjon, Sweden. In this lake, the density of the invertebrate predator Chaoborus flavicans was high, and they performed normal DVM. However, the migration pattern of Chaoborus differed between its four larval instars. Larger instars were found at greater mean depths during the day than were the smaller instars. In both June and July, very few observations of the fourth instar were made at a depth of 1 m during the night. Hence, in June, when only the fourth instar was present, the upper 1-m layer was a Chaoborus-free refuge for other zooplankton during the night. This was not the case in July, when the smaller instars (1-3) hunt at that depth, or in September, when instar four was present there. Crustacean zooplankton showed great flexibility in their DVM behavior. In September, both Bosmina and small Daphnia tended to perform reverse DVM ( i. e., they resided closer to the surface during the day). However, no migration was observed in July. In June, most species performed normal DVM by crowding in the Chaoborus-free stratum close to the surface during the night. Both this pattern of normal DVM of zooplankton in June and the reverse DVM in September indicate that invertebrate predation has a strong effect on the zooplankton community in this fish-rich lake, showing that ontogenetic changes in migration pattern of an invertebrate predator may influence the seasonal variation in the depth-selection behavior of other zooplankton.

Towards an understanding of late Quaternary variations in the continental biogeochemical cycle of silicon: multi-isotope and sediment-flux data for Lake Rutundu, Mt Kenya, East Africa, since 38 ka BP	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Silicon is an essential nutrient for marine diatoms, which dominate the export of organic carbon to the deep ocean. Despite the dominance of the oceanic Si budget by fluvial inputs and the role of the land biosphere in controlling Si losses from rocks and soils to rivers, few studies have considered how continental biogeochemical Si fluxes varied on an orbital timescale. We reconstruct changes in Si cycling by the catchment-lake ecosystem of Lake Rutundu, Mt Kenya (3078 m a.s.l.), over the last ca. 38 ka, using a novel combination of lake-sediment fluxes and stable-isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta(18) O, delta Si-30) data. Under glacial conditions (38.3-14.3 ka BP), high diatom productivity was maintained by substantial losses of dissolved SiO2 and soil nutrients from a sparse, leaky, terrestrial ecosystem. During the following period of enhanced monsoon rainfall and seasonality (14.3-9.5 ka BP), rapid Si cycling by fire-prone, mesic grassland was associated with substantial aeolian transport of opal phytoliths by smoke plumes, but greatly reduced nutrient losses in runoff. Invasion of tall, subalpine shrubs after 9.5 ka BP further enhanced landscape stability, leading to very low sediment fluxes of both phytoliths and diatoms. This case study offers new insights into processes that may have operated at biome to continental scales during the late Quaternary. (c) Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) copyright 2008.

The single factor water quality assessment results showed that the common parameters exceeding the standard in both the wet and dry seasons included dissolved oxygen and total nitrogen, which were inferior to the target water quality grade III by 1-6 grades. The comprehensive water quality order reaching the target grade III was Hutang River (87.5%), Changling River (50.0%), Yaojiang River (43.8%), and Linzhou River (37.5%). The comprehensive water quality in the dry season (90.0% standard-achieving rate) was better than that in the wet season (25.0% standard-achieving rate). These results suggested that the surface runoff might considerably impact water quality. The factor analysis results showed that the basin surveyed in 2018 was mainly polluted by urban sewage and agricultural sources, while the primary pollution source in 2019 was agricultural pollution. Integrated with comprehensive water quality assessment results, in this study, we demonstrated that series of water treatment projects carried out in Yuyao City positively impacted municipal sewage treatment. HIGHLIGHTS A method was applied to intuitively identify whether the water quality grade conforms to the functional area standard and the number of water quality parameters that fail to meet the standard. Surface runoff might significantly impact the water quality. Series of water treatment projects carried out in Yuyao City played a positive role in reducing the deterioration effect of urban sewage on the water quality.						, Long-Ling/0000-0002-1422-975X													1606-9749	1607-0798				JAN	2022	22	1					674	685		10.2166/ws.2021.240	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2021.240		JUL 2021											WOS:000680559000001

This study focused on phytoplankton production in Lake Tanganyika. We provide new estimates of daily and annual primary production, as well as growth rates of phytoplankton, and we compare them with values published in former studies. 2. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the mixed layer ranged from 5 to 120 mg chl-a m(-2) and varied significantly between rainy and dry seasons. Particulate organic carbon concentrations were significantly higher in the south basin (with 196 and 166 mg C m(-3) in the dry and the rainy season, respectively) than in the north basin (112 and 109 mg C m(-3), respectively). 3. Carbon : phosphorus (C : P) ratios varied according to season. Phosphorus limitation seemed to occur more frequently than nitrogen limitation, especially during the rainy season. Severe P deficiencies were rare. 4. Measured particulate daily primary production ranged from 110 to 1410 mg C m(-2) day(-1); seasonal contrasts were well marked in the north basin, but less in the south basin, where primary production peaks occurred also in the rainy season. Estimates of annual primary production, based on daily primary production calculated from chl-a and water transparency, gave values lower than those reported in previous studies.

J	Lewicki, JL				Lewicki, J. L.			Long-term year-round observations of magmatic CO2 emissions on Mammoth Mountain, California, USA	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Diffuse emission of magmatic CO2 is one of the main indicators of volcanic unrest at Mammoth Mountain, but the presence of deep seasonal snowpack at the site has hindered year-round CO2 flux observations. A permanent eddy covariance station was established at the largest area of diffuse CO2 degassing on Mammoth Mountain (Horseshoe Lake tree kill) that measured CO2 fluxes (Fc) and meteorological parameters on a half-hourly basis. From July 22, 2014 to May 24, 2020, Fc ranged from & minus;35 to 10,546 g m & minus;2 d & minus;1. Fc decreased on average by 53% over the study period, tracking the long-term decline in CO2 emissions following the last major increase that occurred at the Horseshoe Lake tree kill area from 2009 to 2011. Statistical and spectral analyses were applied to the Fc and ancillary meteorological parameter time series to understand (1) relationships between these parameters, (2) their dominant periodicities, and (3) changes in Fc that may be unexplained by meteorological forcing. Variations in detrended Fc (Fcdt) were most strongly correlated with wind direction and atmospheric temperature, followed by atmospheric pressure on diurnal to annual time scales, but wind direction likely exerted the most direct control on Fcdt. Comparison of the smoothed (180-d span) Fcdt time series to the time series of average daily snow water equivalent measured-1 km away suggested that snowpack may have suppressed CO2 emissions. No evidence of a change in CO2 emissions related to the last major seismic swarm beneath Mammoth Mountain on February 2-18, 2014 was observed.

For this purpose, young and old stands were selected at eight different locations in the lagoon. It was found that the north-south transect mainly represented a fertility gradient (207-286 mg l(-1) TN, 30-106 mg l(-1) TP), while the east-west transect was associated with significantly decreasing salinity (7-4 ppt). All morphological and biomass variables of P. australis were significantly different between young and old stands. On average, the old (7.3 +/- 0.2 kg DW m(-2)) accumulated three times more total above-ground biomass than the young stands (2.5 +/- 0.1 kg DW m(-2)). Shoot height, diameter and shoot dry weight significantly increased by 25-50% with increasing fertility along the north-south transect. Shoot density significantly decreased from north to south, while it almost doubled in the north sites from 109 +/- 6 to 216 +/- 7 shoots m(-2) along the west-east transect. In separate stepwise multiple regressions, variation in water quality explained 34-63% of the variation in morphology and total above-ground biomass in the old stands (salinity and water level were most important for biomass, transparency also for height and density) while it explained 16-42% of variation in young stands (mainly transparency).

J	Furey, PC; Nordin, RN; Mazumder, A				Furey, PC; Nordin, RN; Mazumder, A			Water level drawdown affects physical and biogeochemical properties of littoral sediments of a reservoir and a natural lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												To determine the influence of water level drawdown on Littoral areas, we compared the temporal and spatial changes in the water column and sediment in the littoral region of a drinking water reservoir and a natural lake. The reservoir (Sooke) experiences more than six meters of seasonal drawdown compared to a nearby, morphometrically and trophically similar lake (Shawnigan) that experiences less than one meter of drawdown. A greater drawdown in Sooke increased the Littoral area and resulted in more Littoral water column mixing, more solar warming, and higher PAR at a greater range of Littoral depths than in Shawnigan. Based on sediment physical and chemical characteristics, sites farthest from shore were most similar, whereas sites in the drawdown exposure zone of Sooke and the upper Littoral area of Shawnigan showed the largest differences. Low macrophyte abundance and loss of fine sediments, nutrients, and organic matter from the drawdown exposure zone in Sooke compared to the equivalent Littoral area in Shawnigan suggest that drawdown enhances sediment erosion and focusing. Element and stable isotope ratios of sediment carbon and nitrogen suggest organic matter in the drawdown zone in Sooke is more allochthonous in origin and is coupled more strongly with deeper sites than in Shawnigan. Organic matter source and distribution also suggests that the Littoral area extends out farther in Sooke than Shawnigan. This study demonstrates that drawdown has the potential to fundamentally change reservoir littoral sediment and biogeochemical characteristics. Understanding how Littoral zones in reservoirs respond to drawdown compared to natural lakes may help water managers make more ecologically informed decisions regarding drawdown impacts on the ecology of littoral zones and water quality.

J	Smith, CD; van der Kamp, G; Arnold, L; Schmidt, R				Smith, Craig D.; van der Kamp, Garth; Arnold, Lauren; Schmidt, Randy			Measuring precipitation with a geolysimeter	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Using the relationship between measured ground-water pressures in deep observation wells and total surface loading, a geological weighing lysimeter (geolysimeter) has the capability of measuring precipitation event totals independently of conventional precipitation gauge observations. Correlations between groundwater pressure change and event precipitation were observed at a co-located site near Duck Lake, SK, over a multi-year and multi-season period. Correlation coefficients (r(2)) varied from 0.99 for rainfall to 0.94 for snowfall. The geolysimeter was shown to underestimate rainfall by 7% while overestimating snowfall by 9% as compared to the unadjusted gauge precipitation. It is speculated that the underestimation of rainfall is due to un-measured run-off and evapotranspiration within the response area of the geolysimeter during larger rainfall events, while the overestimation of snow is at least partially due to the systematic undercatch common to most precipitation gauges due to wind. Using recently developed transfer functions from the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), bias adjustments were applied to the Alter-shielded, Geonor T-200B precipitation gauge measurements of snowfall to mitigate wind-induced errors. The bias between the gauge and geolysimeter measurements was reduced to 3 %. This suggests that the geolysimeter is capable of accurately measuring solid precipitation and can be used as an independent and representative reference of true precipitation.

We studied the links between littoral CH4 fluxes and aquatic vegetation, hydrologic conditions, and sediment quality, and integrated the CH4 fluxes into a whole-lake assessment. Methane fluxes were measured using a closed chamber method in the littoral and pelagic zones of three Finnish mid-boreal lakes from May to October. The cumulative CH4 fluxes were spatially integrated over the lake relative to the vegetation coverage in the littoral, and to depth zones in the pelagic regions. During the ice-free period, 66-77% of the CH4 was released from the littoral zone, and the mean CH4 effluxes from these lakes were 0.08-0.42 mol m(-2) ice-free season(-1). Littoral and pelagic productivity was reflected in CH4 release from the lakes. Our results show that estimates of lake CH4 release should include an assessment of the vegetated littoral zone.

Fish were sampled once a year, in six sampling stations, during the high water period from 2000 to 2003. There were overall reductions in dissolved oxygen levels and increases in transparency of water in lakes in years of moderate floods. The duration of floods influenced species differentially based on their tolerance to hypoxia: in moderate floods, richness of STH increased and numerical abundance and biomass of SIH reduced significantly. Opposite relationships were detected between dissolved oxygen and the attributes of STH and SIH. Dissolved oxygen was the best predictor of variability of STH and SIH in years of moderate floods, whereas water transparency predicted significant amounts of STH in years of short floods. Being positively affected by dissolved oxygen reductions, STH seem to take advantages in persisting in seasonally harsh lentic habitats. The incorporation of abiotic data as well the differential tolerance of species to hypoxia would improve further investigations of the effects of interannual variations in the flood pulse on tropical fish assemblages.

Reproductive biology of Coilia mystus (Linnaeus) from the Yangtze Estuary, China: responses to overexploitation	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Fishery harvest of Coilia mystus in the Yangtze Estuary has declined dramatically since the late 1990s. A full understanding of the reproductive biology of this species is essential for effective management of the population. A total of 1072 females of C. mystus collected from the Yangtze Estuary area between May 2006 and September 2007 were analyzed to reveal the general reproductive biology of the population. Females with increased gonadosomatic index (GSI) and gonads developed to stages IV and V occurred mainly from March through August, indicating a major spawning season in this period; there were also a few females with increased GSI and developed gonads observed in November and January. Absolute fecundity (AF) ranged from 3093 to 36 786; and increased with both body weight (BW) and age. The relationship of AF to BW was fitted to a linear function AF = 924.72 x BW-414.17 (r(2) = 0.82, n = 134, P < 0.05). Relative fecundity was 871 eggs per gram. Oocyte diameter (OD) of mature females ranged from 0.55 to 0.90 mm with a mean (+/- SD) of 0.71 +/- 0.05 mm (n = 3927), independent of BW. The frequency distribution of OD showed a single mode and histological examination demonstrated that the development of oocytes was synchronous within an ovary, suggesting that C. mystus is a single spawner. Compared to previous studies, females in this study tended to produce more but smaller eggs. This increased fecundity may represent biological compensation for the decline in abundance of the population due to overexploitation.

J	Huang, CC; Li, YM; Sun, DY; Le, CF				Huang, Chang-Chun; Li, Yun-Mei; Sun, De-Yong; Le, Cheng-Feng			Retrieval of Microcystis aentginosa Percentage From High Turbid and Eutrophia Inland Water: A Case Study in Taihu Lake	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Microcystis aentginosa (MA), which is one kind of cyanobacteria, is the primary algal species in Taihu Lake. The MA bloom has a significantly negative effect on the human health and water environment ecosystem. The monitoring and prediction of MA bloom become more and more critical for the security of drinking water source and environment in the Taihu Lake area. In this paper, the percentage of MA was estimated from remote-sensing reflectance via a novel spectral shape genetic optimization algorithm. This algorithm focuses on the shape of remote-sensing reflectance, and it can remove the influence of the amplitude of remote-sensing reflectance from the retrieval result. The accuracy of this optimization algorithm is acceptable according to both simulated and in situ data. The percentage of mean square root (RMSP) of the percentage of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient to the total absorption coefficient at 440 nm [a(r) (440 nm)] between the retrieved and the simulated is 18.39%. The RMSP of the total absorption coefficient at 440 nm [a (440 nm)] between the retrieved and the simulated is 3.65%. The RMSP of the percentage of MA[S-f] between the retrieved and the simulated is 13.60%. The RMSP of the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient slope [S] between the retrieved and the simulated is 5.89%. The RMSP of the particle backscatter coefficient slope [Y] between the retrieved and the simulated is 30.46%. In Taihu Lake, the RMSPs of a(r) (440 nm), a (440 nm), S-f, and S between the retrieved and the measured are 36.59%, 35.70%, 19.25%, and 16.80%, respectively. The retrieved percentage of MA(S-f) and Scenedesmus obliquus (1 - S-f) by this model from August 2006, October 2006, to November 2008 indicates the variation trend of algal species in different seasons. This trend accords with the results from previous studies and observations. This paper extends and advances the previous retrieval methods and confirms that the genetic optimization algorithm can be used to retrieve the information of water constituents in the high turbid and eutrophic inland water mass.					huang, changchun/E-6580-2016; huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; Le, Chengfeng/A-2584-2013	huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X; huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663; 													0196-2892	1558-0644				OCT	2011	49	10	2				4090	4100		10.1109/TGRS.2011.2129521	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2129521													WOS:000296889000022
J	Mmbaga, NE				Mmbaga, Naza E.			Drivers of land use changes and impacts on human-hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) interactions in villages adjacent to Lake Babati, Tanzania	DISCOVER ENVIRONMENT												Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) are victims of land use changes (LUC) due to their semi-aquatic nature. Although human-hippopotamus interactions (HHI) are known to exist in the area surrounding Lake Babati, nothing is known about the LUC in relation to the interactions. The study aimed at assessing the trend of LUC in the last 20 years in relation to time of establishing new settlement and farming seasons in relation to HHI, respondents' perceptions of HHI, and mitigation measures used by local people against Hippos adjacent Lake Babati. Remote sensing and GIS techniques, questionnaires and focused group discussions were used to assess human perceptions regarding trends of the LUC in the study area. LUC was monitored by using landsat images from the years 1999 and 2019. The findings indicate an increase in settlement while water, agroforestry, and seasonal agricultural lands were decreasing. The time respondents stayed in the village, farm size, and respondents' perception of HHI trends were observed to vary with the distance from the lake. The presence of LUC on adjacent Lake Babati jeopardized the ecological integrity of Hippos' habitat and increased tension and overlap between hippos' and human needs. The findings provide a baseline for managing HHI and recommend proper land use planning that prioritizes the use of alternative crops like fruit trees especially within 3 km from the lake. Human population and settlement expansion patterns should also be monitored in areas closer to the lake for sustaining wildlife conservation and livelihood development in Lake Babati and surrounding areas.																				2731-9431				JUL 13	2023	1	1							8	10.1007/s44274-023-00008-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s44274-023-00008-y													WOS:001594767700002

All lakes were confined to a relatively small area within a 50-km diameter. Most of the lakes were within the Pyrenees National Park, which is restricted to recreational hiking, angling, and seasonal grazing of livestock, and are not subject to any known point Sources of contaminants. Fish collected were mainly of 1 species (Salmo trutta fario), which is stocked regularly in the lakes. With increasing elevation, lake temperatures declined along with electrical conductivity and planktonic chlorophyll a. In contrast, water column nutrients (total phosphorus and total nitrogen) and epilithic periphyton biomass were not correlated with lake elevation. Of the global contaminants measured in fish, mercury, dicholorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its derivatives, and polybrorninated diphenyl ethers showed the strongest positive correlation with elevation. Hg levels in some fish exceeded health consumption guidelines in these mountain lakes. Variation in fish contaminant levels was not related to differences in growth rate or to Fish trophic position as determined using delta N-15 stable isotope measurements. This implies that the delivery and/or retention of many of these contaminants increase with lake elevation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J	Kitchen, SG				Kitchen, Stanley G.			Climate and human influences on historical fire regimes (AD 1400-1900) in the eastern Great Basin (USA)	HOLOCENE												High fire activity in western North America is associated with drought. Drought and fire prevail under negative El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phases in the Southwest and with positive phases in the Northwest. Here, I infer climate effects on historic fire patterns in the geographically intermediate, eastern Great Basin and seek out evidence of human influence on reconstructed fire regimes. Surface fire chronologies were constructed for 10 sites using tree-ring-based fire scars. Regional (67) and local (247) fire years and no-fire (187) years were identified from 1400 to 1900 CE. I compared fire chronologies with indices of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), ENSO, and PDO. Regionally, fires were significantly more common during drought and were associated with negative ENSO and positive-to-negative PDO transitions while no-fire years were associated with positive ENSO and negative-to-positive PDO transitions. Conditions were significantly wetter 2 years prior to regional fire years and drier 4 years prior to no-fire years, providing evidence that fires were historically fuel limited. Local fire years occurred under a broad range of climate conditions. Most sites showed either persistent late or bimodal (early and late) fire seasonality patterns. These patterns are distinct from the mid-season peak observed for modern lightning-caused fires, suggesting a human influence on historical ignition patterns. Results demonstrate that climate was an important synchronizer of fire at the regional scale and that locally fire regimes were the product of climate-regulated fuels and some combination of human and lightning ignition patterns.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2016	26	3					397	407		10.1177/0959683615609751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615609751													WOS:000371133100006

Fish of both sexes were sampled in monthly intervals between April and August in order to cover the onset of gametogenesis. Investigated parameters included gonad histology, plasma levels of 17 beta-oestradiol (E2), testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and 17,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20 beta-P) as well as the expression of gonadotropin subunits in the pituitary. Furthermore, the mRNA-expression of brain-type aromatase (cyp19a1b), androgen receptor (ar), and estrogen receptor isoforms was studied at the pituitary level. The onset of gametogenesis - as indicated by follicles with cortical alveoli in females and first spermatogonia B in males - was observed in July, accompanied by a significant up-regulation of follicle-stimulating hormone beta (fsh beta) mRNA in the pituitary in both sexes. On the other hand, luteinizing hormone beta (lh beta) mRNA increased later on in August. In males, the increase of fsh beta mRNA in July coincided with a rise in plasma 11-KT concentrations. In females, E2 in plasma increased later, not until August, shortly before true vitellogenesis (late cortical alveoli stage). Expression of sex steroid receptors in the pituitary revealed only minor seasonal fluctuations. Most pronounced, ar mRNA displayed the highest level pre-spawning in both sexes. Interestingly, cyp19a1b mRNA-expression in the pituitary increased in parallel with fsh beta already before any changes in plasma E2 or T occurred. These data suggest an important role of pituitary FSH and aromatase at the onset of gametogenesis in the roach. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Rippey, B; McSorley, C				Rippey, Brian; McSorley, Catherine			Oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Livingstone and Imboden (1996) model for the oxygen depletion rate in lake hypolimnia was evaluated with field results in 32 lakes. The volumetric oxygen consumption rate (J(V)) was strongly related to lake trophic state, as represented by the growing season mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and annual mean total phosphorus concentration, and might reach a maximum of 0.23-0.24 g O-2 m(-3) d(-1) in eutrophic lakes. The areal oxygen consumption rate (J(A)) was not related to trophic state and was lower than the value estimated by the sediment core method, particularly in eutrophic lakes; the mean was 0.0816 +/- 0.0150 g O-2 m(-2) whole sediment d(-1). We modified the model and it was used to confirm that the field J(A), the average for the hypolimnion for the deoxygenation period, is influenced by J(V) and the range of sediment area to water volume ratio, alpha(Z) (Z is water depth), in the hypolimnion, as well as the oxygen consumption rate in whole sediment (R). It was suggested that this is the reason for the difference between field and sediment core J(A) values. The R in 10 lakes varied from 7 to 460 g O-2 m(-3) whole sediment d(-1). Overall, the Livingstone and Imboden model with constant J(A) and with a J(V) value derived from an empirical relationship with either measure of trophic state was considered to be a suitable condensed model for oxygen depletion in lake hypolimnia.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2009	54	3					905	916		10.4319/lo.2009.54.3.0905	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.54.3.0905													WOS:000268325000022
J	Sassi, M; Trital, G				Sassi, Maria; Trital, Gopal			A latent growth curve modelling approach to seasonal and spatial dynamics of food security heterogeneities in rural Lake Naivasha Basin, Kenya	FOOD SECURITY												The increasing complexity of food insecurity, malnutrition, and chronic poverty faced by Sub-Saharan Africa warrants urgent categorisation and tracking of household food security along both temporal and spatial dimensions. This will help to effectively target, monitor and evaluate population-level programs and specific interventions aimed at addressing food insecurity. Traditional longitudinal analysis does not address the dynamics of inter- and intrahousehold heterogeneities within the seasonal and spatial context of household-level food security. This study is the first to overcome such limitations by adopting a multi-group piecewise latent growth curve model in the analysis of the food security situation in a statistically representative sample of 601 households involved in subsistence and cut-flower commercial agriculture, around Lake Naivasha. We considered food security as a latent concept, which manifests as food security outcomes in our primary longitudinal dataset from March 2018 to January 2019. Our analysis highlights the temporal and spatial dynamics of food security and advances new evidence on inter- and intrahousehold heterogeneities in food security across different seasons for the subsistence and commercial farming clusters. These heterogeneities were demonstrated primarily during the hunger season from March to June, and persisted in both the clusters and across months, albeit with different intensities. Moreover, our results indicate the importance of commercial agriculture in achieving food security in the hunger season. Our study suggests the need of a multidisciplinary approach to food security and the introduction of well-coordinated interventions for the development of subsistence and commercial agriculture considering the seasonal and cluster-level specificities.

Seasonal changes of water quality in a tropical shallow and eutrophic reservoir in the metropolitan region of Recife (Pernambuco-Brazil)	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												This study investigated the water quality in an urban eutrophic reservoir in Northeastern Brazil, considering the influence of seasonality. Monthly, samples were collected in the sub-surface reservoir. The following abiotic variables were analyzed: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, apparent color, turbidity, conductivity, fluoride, total nitrogen, chlorides, total dissolved solids, total hardness, iron, copper, manganese, aluminum, chlorophyll-a and phaeophytin. Total and thermotolerant coliforms were analyzed according to APHA (2012). Cyanobacteria density was quantified through its biomass. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation test. Higher values mean phytoplankton biomass (26.3mm(3).L-1) occurred in the dry season, especially Planktothrix agardhii and Geiterinema amphibium, which occurred in 100% of samples. High trophic state index was detected throughout the year. Seasonality exerted some influence on both biotic and abiotc variables, leading to changes in water quality of the reservoir.

Four sampling sites were chosen, two in each floodplain lake. Night samples were taken with plankton nets during three spawning seasons (monthly, from October to March) from 2001 to 2005. The highest diversity and abundance were recorded at Saraiva Lake, with 25 taxa being identified. In Xambre Lake, only sedentary species were captured, and the most abundant species were Plagioscion squamosissimus and Hypophthalmus edentatus. The greatest abundance of larvae was found in the second spawning season. In the Saraiva Lake, the most abundant species were Moenkhausia aff. intermedia, Hyphessobrycon sp., and Bryconamericus stramineus, but larvae of known migratory species were also documented. In this lake, the greatest abundance of larvae was found in the third spawning. Larvae abundance was influenced by water temperature and conductivity. The high diversity and abundance recorded in Saraiva Lake may be a result of its connectivity with the Parana River, and the low diversity and abundance observed at Xambre Lake are likely due to its isolation from the river. This work shows the importance of these lagoons for fish development, for both sedentary and migratory species. Both lagoons may be considered to have extreme ecological importance and they are also extremely susceptible to impacts, so any careless disturbance may cause irreversible damage.

The active layer (seasonally thawed soil overlying permafrost) accommodates dynamic hydrological and biological processes for 10-16 weeks per year. Wetted margins (visually wetted areas with high moisture content) adjacent to lakes and streams are potential locations of great importance in the MDV because of the regular presence of liquid water, compared with the rest of the landscape where liquid water is rare. At 11 plots (four adjacent to lakes, seven adjacent to streams), soil particle size distribution, soil electrical conductivity, Soil water content and isotopic signature, width of the wetted margin, and active layer thaw depth were characterised to determine how these gradients influence physicochemical properties that determine microbial habitat and biogeochemical cycling. Sediments were generally coarse-grained in wetted margins adjacent to both lakes and streams. Wetted margins ranged from 1.04 to 11.01 in in average length and were found to be longer at lakeside sites than streamside. Average thaw depths ranged from 0.12 to 0.85 m, and were found to be deepest under lake margins. Lake margins also had much higher soil electrical conductivity, steeper topographic gradients, but more gradual soil moisture gradients than stream margins. Patterns of soil water delta O-18 and delta D distribution indicate capillary action and evaporation from wetted margins; margin pore waters generally demonstrated isotopic enrichment with distance from the shore, indicating evaporation of soil water. Lake margin pore waters were significantly more negative in D-XS (D-XS = delta D-8 delta O-18) than streamside pore waters, indicating a longer history of evaporation there. Differences between lake and stream margins can be explained by the more consistent availability of water to lake margins than stream margins. Differences in margin characteristics between lakes and streams have important consequences for the microbial habitat of these margins and their functional role in biogeochemical cycling at these terrestrial-aquatic interfaces.

These first appearances may reflect novel hominin adaptive responses to shifting resource bases over geological time and/or an increasingly seasonal distribution of food over the annual cycle. Whereas regional environmental change has been documented during the Plio-Pleistocene of East Africa, it is difficult to resolve relative proportions of specific habitats at a given place and time, how these may have changed over time, and the explicit nature of particular habitats. Detailed reconstructions of paleohabitats based on paleontological, geological and geochemical evidence are necessary in order to better understand the interplay between environmental change and hominin biological and behavioral evolution. Reconstruction of the habitats in which archaeological sites were formed provides a window on habitat utilization by early Homo, independent of inferred hominin adaptations to specific environmental settings based on hominin morphology or the postmortem distribution of hominin fossils. Here we report on the paleoenvironmental setting of the ca. 2.0 Ma archaeological occurrences at Kanjera, southwestern Kenya. Sedimentological analysis indicates that the site was formed in an alluvial fan, probably near the margin of a lake. Isotopic analysis of pedogenic carbonates indicates that the site complex was formed in an open habitat. Bovid dietary category and taxonomic representation demonstrates that a preponderance of animals grazed and preferred open habitats. Site formation occurred in a grassland-dominated ecosystem, rather than an isolated patch of grassy vegetation within a more wooded setting.

Seismic stratigraphy of Lago Fagnano sediments (Tierra del Fuego, Argentina) - A potential archive of paleoclimatic change and tectonic activity since the Late Glacial	GEOLOGICA ACTA												Located at 54 degrees S in the heart of the Island of Tierra del Fuego, Lago Fagnano occupies the deepest of a chain of en-echelon tectonic depressions along the Magallanes-Fagnano Transform system (MFT). A recent geophysical campaign combining 3.5 kHz (pinger) single-channel with I in(3) airgun multi-channel systems surveyed more than 100 in of glacio-lacustrine sediments filling two main sub-basins. These data provide a unique opportunity to visualize the most recent lacustrine sequence with high-resolution while simultaneously imaging the oldest infill. A preliminary seismic stratigraphic analysis of the high-resolution 3.5 kHz pinger data allowed the identification of three major seismostratigraphic units (A, the oldest and C, the youngest). While unit A is interpreted as glacially derived sediments, the overlying unit B is interpreted as fining upward sequences of proglacial turbidites reflecting sediment pulses released by the retreating Fagnano glacier during the last deglaciation. A major environmental change occurred during deposition of unit C when pelagic style of sedimentation is intercalated by sequences of downslope mass flow events probably triggered by relatively strong tectonic pulses along the MFT system. Gravity cores show a regular alternation of light and dark laminae occasionally interrupted by homogenous sedimentary units interpreted as turbidites. Ultra-high resolution X-ray fluorescence micro-profiles show fluctuations in major trace elements at mm scale that may indicate seasonal variations in the sedimentary influx. These core data provide a unique record of decadal changes in regional climate that can be compared with other marine and continental archives to improve our understanding of the forcing mechanisms behind climate change.					; Waldmann, Nicolas/AAC-3974-2020; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022	Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Moy, Christopher/0000-0002-2177-5265; Waldmann, Nicolas/0000-0003-4627-208X; Dunbar, Robert/0000-0002-9728-5609; 													1695-6133					MAR	2008	6	1					101	110																WOS:000254426400008

However, beyond a certain threshold at very high salinity, the species exhibits impaired growth and precocious reproduction. In this study, the relationships between reproductive parameters, environmental salinity and condition factor were investigated in wild populations of this species that were sampled in two consecutive years (2003 and 2004) from three locations in Senegal with different salinities: Guiers lake (freshwater, 0 psu), Hann bay (seawater, 37 psu) and Saloum estuary (hypersaline water, 66-127 psu). The highest absolute fecundity and spawning weight were recorded in seawater by comparison to either freshwater or hypersaline water whereas the poorest condition factors were observed in the most saline sampling site. These results reflect higher resource allocation to the reproduction due to the lowest costs of adaptation to salinity in seawater (the natural environment of this species) rather than differences in food resources at sites and/or efficiency at foraging and prey availability. Fecundities, oocyte size as well as spawning weight were consistent from year to year. However, the relative fecundity in the Saloum estuary varied significantly between the dry and rainy raisons with higher values in the wet season, which seems to reflect seasonal variations in environmental salinity. Such a reproductive tactic of producing large amounts of eggs in the rainy season when the salinity in the estuary was lower, would give the fry a better chance at survival and therefore assures a high larval recruitment. An inverse correlation was found between relative fecundity and oocyte size at the two extreme salinity locations, indicating that S. melanotheron has different reproductive strategies in these ecosystems. The adaptive significance of these two reproductive modes is discussed in regard to the heavy osmotic constraint imposed by extreme salinities and high inter-specific competition.																			1932-6203					JAN 13	2012	7	1							e29464	10.1371/journal.pone.0029464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029464								22253726					WOS:000301361500013

Riverine water quality generally varies depending on region and season because of the spatiotemporal variations in natural factors and anthropogenic activities. Monthly water quality measurements of eight water quality variables were analyzed for two years at 16 sites of the Tianmuhu watershed. The variables were examined using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and factor analysis/principal component analysis (FA/PCA) to reveal the spatiotemporal variations in riverine nutrients and to identify their potential sources. HCA revealed three geographical groups and three periods. Two drainages comprising towns and large villages were the most polluted, six drainages comprising widely distributed tea plantations and orchards were moderately polluted, and eight drainages without the factors were the least polluted. The river was most polluted in June when the first heavy rain (daily rainfall > 50 mm) occurs after fertilization and the number of rainy days is most (monthly number of rainy days > 20 days). Moderate pollution was observed from October to May, during which more than 60% of the total nitrogen fertilizer and all of the phosphorus fertilizer are applied to the cropland, the total manure is applied to tea plantations and orchards, and a monthly rainfall ranging from 0 mm to 164 mm occurs. The remaining months were characterized by frequent raining (i.e., number of rainy days per month ranged from 5 to 24) and little use of fertilizers, and were thus least polluted. FA/PCA identified that the greatest pollution sources were the runoff from tea plantations and orchards, domestic pollution and the surface runoff from towns and villages, and rural sewage, which had extremely high contributions of riverine nitrogen, phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand, respectively. The tea plantations and orchards promoted by the agricultural comprehensive development (ACD) were not environmentally friendly. Riverine nitrogen is a major water pollution parameter in hilly watersheds affected by ACD, and this parameter would not be reduced unless its loss load through the runoff from tea plantations and orchards is effectively controlled.

Bioturbations disturbing mechanical SSDS suggest that soft-sediment deformations may occur syndepositionally or soon after deposition. The discussed mechanical SSDS are developed in a lacustrine environment, most being in lower shoreface and offshore facies. The mechanical SSDS found in the PlouA3/4nice lake deposits occur in all lacustrine facies associations (290 SSDS horizons in a 67-m-thick succession). The cumulative thickness in cm of mechanical SSDS horizons per meter of thickness (ratio cm SSDS/m) is the highest in lower shoreface facies where it reaches from 50 up to 59.7 cm SSDS/m. Offshore facies association reaches 44 cm SSDS/m. Upper shoreface facies associations have 25.9 and 26.0 cm SSDS/m, while nearshore/mudflat facies associations preserve from 22.5 to 20.5 cm SSDS/m, and in palustrine carbonate, 13.5 cm mechanical SSDS/m was found. SSDS in fluvial facies are rare (2.9 cm SSDS/m). The distribution of SSDS in the Sm-1 borehole shows clear relationships to sedimentary facies and processes such as density flows or fluctuation of water level. The relationships of particular structures indicate a relative timing of formation which is as follows: sediment deposition was followed by the formation of mechanical SSDS, then by bioturbation, and finally by deformations due to early diagenetic growth of carbonates and silica. The distribution of SSDS in vertical sections and their direct relationship to sedimentary facies point to endogenic rather than external trigger mechanisms such as seismic activity. The main endogenic trigger mechanisms responsible for the origin of SSDS included a Stephanian semi-humid seasonal climate, basin morphology with relatively steep gradients, and elevated source areas, which created a conducive environment for rapid and repeated deposition of sheetfloods and hyperconcentrated flows and turbidites causing syndepositional loading.

J	Hofmann, H; Peeters, F				Hofmann, Hilmar; Peeters, Frank			In-Situ Optical and Acoustical Measurements of the Buoyant Cyanobacterium P. Rubescens: Spatial and Temporal Distribution Patterns	PLOS ONE												Optical (fluorescence) and acoustic in-situ techniques were tested in their ability to measure the spatial and temporal distribution of plankton in freshwater ecosystems with special emphasis on the harmful and buoyant cyanobacterium P. rubescens. Fluorescence was measured with the multi-spectral FluoroProbe (Moldaenke FluoroProbe, MFP) and a Seapoint Chlorophyll Fluorometer (SCF). In-situ measurements of the acoustic backscatter strength (ABS) were conducted with three different acoustic devices covering multiple acoustic frequencies (614 kHz ADCP, 2 MHz ADP, and 6 MHz ADV). The MFP provides a fast and reliable technique to measure fluorescence at different wavelengths in situ, which allows discriminating between P. rubescens and other phytoplankton species. All three acoustic devices are sensitive to P. rubescens even if other scatterers, e. g., zooplankton or suspended sediment, are present in the water column, because P. rubescens containing gas vesicles has a strong density difference and hence acoustic contrast to the ambient water and other scatterers. After calibration, the combination of optical and acoustical measurements not only allows qualitative and quantitative observation of P. rubescens, but also distinction between P. rubescens, other phytoplankton, and zooplankton. As the measuring devices can sample in situ at high rates they enable assessment of plankton distributions at high temporal (minutes) and spatial (decimeters) resolution or covering large temporal (seasonal) and spatial (basin scale) scales.

First-order catchment mass balance during the wet season in the Panama Canal Watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Tropical hydrology is poorly understood for a number of reasons. Intense biological activity in the tropics introduces complexities to the hydrologic process. Bioturbation, rapid rates of decay, and intensive insect activity all tend to promote rapid flow paths in the upper soil. Aggressive weathering leads to clays depleted of light cations and deep soil profiles. Processes in the seasonal tropics are further complicated by seasonal transitions, and very large changes in catchment storage between seasons. Beginning in 2005, we installed a suite of hydrologic sensors in a 16.7 ha first-order catchment in the Panama Canal Watershed to observe hydrologic variables and identify the dominant streamflow generation processes. The site is located near the village of Gamboa, which is located on the east bank of the Panama Canal at the confluence of Lake Gatun and the Chagres River. The study catchment is located on the north side of a ridge off the eastern flank of a 230 m tall hill known as Cerro Pelado, and is covered by 70-120 year old re-growth triple-canopy forest. Measurements included: rainfall above the canopy, throughfall, stemflow, evapotranspiration, shallow groundwater levels and streamflow. Deep groundwater storage was not measured. This paper describes measurements made, data collected, and the worth of those data in estimating the mass balance closure of a first-order catchment during the wet season. We compare measurements of the different components of the water cycle with observations from other published studies from the tropics. Data analysis results indicate water balance closure errors of approximately 8%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Annual flooding and fish-mercury bioaccumulation in the environmentally impacted Rio Madeira (Amazon)	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Regular annual flooding of the Amazonian rivers changes the aquatic environment affecting fish feeding strategies. The Rio Madeira has been greatly impacted by deforestation for agricultural projects, damming for a hydroelectric power plant, and alluvial gold extraction. We studied fish-Hg concentrations within defined weight ranges of representative species at the top of the food web, comparing high and low water seasons. Selected piscivorous species (Cichla spp, Hoplias malabaricus, Pinirampus pirinampu, Serrasalmus spp) showed a large variation of Hg concentrations but only "traira" (Hoplias malabaricus) showed a statistically significant difference between seasons. However, the bioaccumulation trends during high and low waters were similar for "tucunare" (Cichla spp) and "traira" (Hoplias malabaricus) but different for "piranhas" (Serrasalmus spp), "barba chata" (Pinirampus pirinampu) and the detritivorous Prochilodus nigricans. Fish-Hg bioaccumulation is species specific; changes in feeding strategies brought by flooding seasons can change the bioaccumulation pattern without systematically affecting the overall accrual of methylmercury in tertiary consumer species. It appears that naturally occurring Hg and the high sediment load of the Rio Madeira are secondary factors in the Hg bioaccumulation pattern of fish species at the top of the food chain.

Ciliate ecology in the eutrophic Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario: Community structure and feeding characteristics	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The ciliate community of the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario was assessed over a six year period from 2003 - 2008. One eutrophic site in the upper bay (Belleville) and one more oligotrophic site in the lower bay (Conway), were included in the survey. Both sites contained a mixture of Haptoria, Strobilidium, Halteria, Strombidium, and Vorticella, although the relative proportions varied among sites resulting in different community structures. Ciliate biomass was found to be significantly higher at Belleville (mean: 100.2 +/- 14.1 mg m(-3)) compared to Conway (mean: 37.1 +/- 3.5mg m(-3)), but could be explained by sudden pulses of Haptoria, primarily species of Mesodinium, which peaked as high as 678.1 mg m(-3). Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed a clustering of Halteria, Strobilidium, Tintinnina, Urotricha and Vorticella with surface temperature along with autotrophic picoplankton as a potential prey item. The results suggest that autotrophic picoplankton may be an important food resource for the ciliate community and that there is a strong seasonal gradient to community structure. Future research should be directed at understanding how ciliates influence the transfer of both primary and secondary production to higher trophic levels.

We used multiple indices to assess sediment condition and ecotoxicity caused by heavy metal(loid)s (HMs) in Zarivar International Wetland (Zarivar) of Iran. We sampled the wetland at 12 stations using a Grab sampler, during both rainy and dry seasons. Using an atomic absorption spectroscopy and a mercury analyzer, we measured As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and Hg. HMs temporal and spatial changes and general features of sediment were analyzed. Except Fe and Mn, all metals appear to have anthropogenic sources. We calculated toxic units (TUs) and contamination factors (CF) for all HMs. n-ary sumation TU calculations showed As> Cd> Cr and Ni to have the highest contributions in succession. CF indicated Cd, As, Pb and Cr, to have the highest concentrations, respectively. As (38.54 +/- 10 mg/kg (-1)) and Cd (5.75 +/- 2.01 mg/kg (-1)) exceeded their probable effect levels in 100% and 90% of the stations, respectively. Zarivar is classified as "very highly polluted" in rainy season (755.34 +/- 289.97) and "considerably polluted" in dry season (489.98 +/- 232.62) based on risk index values we calculated.

To better understand this process, the present study evaluates the influence of environmental variables on zooplankton community structure, focusing on the hydrological variation of the flood pulse. For this purpose, we address the following questions: (i) What is the effect of hydrologic period on environmental characteristics and the structure of zooplankton community? (ii) Do environmental and biological similarities between sampling sites in a lacustrine ecosystem differ within flooding and flushing periods? (iii) How do zooplanktonic organisms respond to environmental gradients? To achieve this work, environmental and biological samples were collected in 20 sampling sites along the Lago Grande do Curuai in March (flooding period) and September (flushing period) of 2013. While some zooplankton taxa showed relationship with some environmental variables, we estimate that the hydrological variation had a higher control over the taxonomic composition of Lago Grande do Curuai. Therefore, the strong flow that promotes connectivity between the habitats in the floodplain lake may also justify the similar pattern of heterogeneity between sampling sites for the zooplankton community in both periods, despite their environmental differences.					; Almeida, Alexandre/MAH-0565-2025; Cardoso Galli Vieira, Ludgero/G-6985-2017; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/J-6888-2016; Vieira, Ludgero/G-6985-2017	Albuquerque de Souza, Carla/0000-0002-0205-8594; Cardoso Galli Vieira, Ludgero/0000-0002-9411-6666; Gomes, Leonardo/0000-0003-2113-1117; 													0213-8409	1989-1806					2020	39	1					35	48		10.23818/limn.39.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.39.03													WOS:000509685900004

This study directed towards the recognition of a variety of aquatic environments in Costa Rica 40 habitats, including lakes, wetlands, and small aquatic systems, e.g., ponds, ditches, puddles, tree holes, and bromeliads established the presence of 105 species of Monogononta representing 33 genera. In total, 91 species and 19 genera were found to be new for Costa Rica, including 29 species recorded for the first time in Central America e.g., Ascomorpha klementi, Beauchampia crucigera, Brachionus mirabilis, Cephalodella panarista, Filinia saltator, Horaella brehmi, Lecane amazonica, Lecane pawlowskii, Lepadella lindaui, and Mytilina acanthophora. The application of 2 estimates of total species richness allowed us predict that 70 new rotifer species may potentially be found in Costa Rica. Thus, we assume that only about 60% of the potential Costa Rican rotifer diversity was ascertained in our study. The most diverse genus was Lecane with 36 species. Among the most frequent rotifers there were some lecanid species, e.g., Lecane bulla, Lecane hamata, Lecane closterocerca and Lecane leontina, and also Colurella obtusa, Plationus patulus, Anuraeopsis fissa, and Platyias quadricornis.					; Kuczyńska-Kippen, Natalia/AAC-1955-2022	Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia/0000-0002-0513-9461; 													1300-0179	1303-6114					2020	44	3					238	247		10.3906/zoo-2002-29	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/zoo-2002-29													WOS:000539051200004

The objective of this research is to model and forecasting the demand of international tourists visiting Puno using the ARIMA methodology of Box-Jenkins, for this the study considers monthly arrival information of foreign tourists between the years 2003 to 2017. Finally, using the statistics MAPE, Z, r, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz Criterion (SC) was identified to the SARIMA (6, 1, 24)(1, 0, 1)12 model as the most efficient for modeling and forecasting of the demand for international tourism in the Puno region.

Differences, sources and human health risks of heavy metals such as Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, V, Zn and Mn in four seasons of lake water were analyzed. Among them, the content of V element was the highest in all four seasons (1.80 similar to 7.04mg/ l), while the content of Cd was the lowest (0.03 similar to 1.92mg/l). In addition, the elements of the super background value are: V, Ni, Cu, and Cr, wherein the V content exceeds the background value multiple of 4.3 to 12.93. Principal component analysis (PCA) results show that the three principal components share 81.6% of the variance contribution rate. Finally, the results of lake water health risk assessment showed that the risk of non-carcinogenicity of 8 heavy metals was: Cu>Cd>Cr>Ni>Pb>V>Zn>Mn. The Cr element is the main carcinogenic risk element in the lake water of the study area, and the risk value is concentrated at 1.16E-08 similar to 7.54E-07. Among the exposed population, the hazard index (HI) of Mn was 49.21 times that of adults. In general, the hazard index value is <1, and the cancer risk is within acceptable levels (1E-06). But from the perspective of public health and safety, we need to maintain further observation and research on these elements.

The phytoplankton consisted of 103 taxa, classified in 12 phytoplankton functional groups (PFGs), with dominancy of 5 species, Chrysosporum ovalisporum, Dolichospermum mendotae, Planktothrix rubescens, Fragilaria capucina, and Mougeotia sp. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') was calculated and results ranged between 0.41 and 2.47. The redundancy analysis (RDA) and Spearman's correlation analysis were used to assess the relationships between the PFGs and environmental variables. According to the multiple comparisons of the data, the main efficient factors that determined the seasonal distribution of the PFGs were TP, DO, SiO2, SD, and pH. The ecological requirements of the dominant PFGs (C, D, F, J, H-1, Lo, S-N, P, R, T, and X-2) indicated mainly meso-eutrophic waters. Similarly, Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) stated mesotrophy conditions. As a result, the approach of PFGs can he successfully applied in a deep, alkaline lake to understand the water quality and trophic status.

We examined long-term variation of bacterial production (BP) under these environmental changes from 2016-2017 in the north basin of Lake Biwa. BP was estimated by measuring the incorporation of stable isotope N-15-labeled deoxyadenosine (N-15-dA) from June 2016 and December 2017 and compared with measurements from 1986 and 1997-1998. In 1986, BP was measured by following H-3-labeled thymidine (H-3-TdR) incorporation and in 1997-1998 by tracking bacterial abundance in incubations and calculating specific growth rates (mu). To allow direct comparison of N-15-dA and H-3-TdR incorporation rates, we determined a conversion factor. To estimate mu in 2016-2017, we determined a factor for converting N-15-dA incorporation to cell number increase. In 2016-2017, the N-15-dA incorporation rate ranged from 0.13 to 30.7 pmol l(-1) h(-1) and mu ranged from 0.016 to 0.70 day(-1). BP values from H-3-TdR incorporation rates in 1986 and mu in 1997-1998 were 4.6 and 2.1 times BP values in 2016-2017, respectively, confirming the decrease in BP over the past 3 decades in Lake Biwa. Water quality data showed only low decrease rates for BOD and total phosphorus concentration from the 1980s, whereas the rate of decrease for PO43- concentrations was equivalent to that of BP. BP and decomposition of organic matter are known to be strongly P-limited in Lake Biwa. Our results suggest that the decrease in BP can be explained by a reduction in readily bioavailable PO43-. Organic phosphorus can also be an important P-source for BP under conditions with very low PO43- concentrations (nM), and changes in the bioavailability of organic phosphorus might have also regulated BP dynamics.

The attenuation of sunlight in water is directly controlled by optically active substances. Here, the seasonal and interlake heterogeneities of the diffuse attenuation coefficients (K-d(lambda)) of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were studied based on field investigations in six Yunnan Plateau lakes (i.e., Chenghai, Dianchi, Erhai, Fuxian, Lugu and Yangzong) of China, October 2014-July 2016. The results revealed that K-d(lambda) generally increased with decreasing wavelength and increasing trophic state and that K-d(UVR) presented higher interlake heterogeneity than K-d(PAR). The interlake heterogeneity surpassed the seasonal heterogeneity of K-d(lambda), whereas the intralake seasonal heterogeneity, which is related to the lake trophic state and solar spectrum, was obvious. Although the main factors affecting K-d(lambda) were chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and phytoplankton in general, the interlake heterogeneity was found. In eutrophic, turbid shallow Lake Dianchi, CDOM primarily affected UV-B, whereas total suspended solids (TSS) and/or phytoplankton had important effects on K-d(UV-B), K-d(UV-A) and K-d(PAR). CDOM, TSS and phytoplankton influenced the K-d(UV-B), K-d(UV-A) and K-d(PAR) in the deep mesotrophic Lake Chenghai and Lake Erhai, but the main particulate factors were different between these two lakes. In the deep, oligotrophic clear Lake Fuxian and Lake Lugu, only the significant effect of CDOM on K-d(UVR) in Lake Fuxian was detected. Additionally, the factors affecting K-d(lambda) in Lake Yangzong were atypical, possibly due to the artificial addition of massive amounts of ferric chloride.

The concentrations of extracellular microcystitis (MCs, analyzed by ELISA) in 206 water samples collected from 94 localities have been investigated. Observed MC concentrations were relatively high in comparison with the literature data, although weather conditions during the covered season (year 2004) were less favorable for the cyanobacterial water blooms. Detectable MCs (>0.1 25 mu g/L) were found in 145 waters (70% of all samples) with a median concentration of 0.67 mu/L. The total median, including samples with no detectable MCs, was 0.26 mu g/L. The seasonal trend showed an increase from July to September at most localities (maximum concentrations of about 8 mu g/L and extremes up to 37 mu g/L). However, a peak at the beginning of the season or continuously elevated MC concentrations were also observed at some localities. Positive correlations between increasing concentrations of MCs and the dominancy of Microcystis spp. have been observed. The survey provides the first large-scale study of the occurrence and seasonal variability of extracellular microcystins that are of particular interest for drinking water management.					; Marsalkova, Eliska/ABC-9954-2020; Blaha, Ludek/N-6343-2013; Babica, Pavel/B-2587-2013	Marsalkova, Eliska/0000-0002-7828-4037; Blaha, Ludek/0000-0002-7314-7455; Marsalek, Blahoslav/0000-0002-5559-2723; Babica, Pavel/0000-0001-6399-3554													1863-0650					SEP	2007	35	4					348	354		10.1002/clen.200700010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clen.200700010													WOS:000250029200020
J	Hillebrand, H; Kahlert, M				Hillebrand, H; Kahlert, M			Effect of grazing and nutrient supply on periphyton biomass and nutrient stoichiometry in habitats of different productivity	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The impact of grazing and nutrient supply on epilithic periphyton was investigated in factorial field experiments in four seasons at three Swedish sites of different productivity and herbivore composition (Lake Limmaren, Lake Erken, and Vaddo, a low salinity coastal site). Nutrient supply was enhanced by a granulose fertilizer containing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and grazer density was manipulated by exclusion cages. Algal biomass was increased by nutrient enrichment and reduced by grazer presence, but effects were highly variable between sites and seasons. Generally, grazers had stronger effects on algal biomass than nutrient enrichment, but there was no overriding effect of either grazing or nutrients. This indicated a simultaneous top-down and bottom-up control of algal biomass, Taxonomic composition of the periphyton was more affected by grazer presence than by nutrients. Internal nutrient ratios of the algae indicated N limitation at two of the sites. At all sites, the content of N and P in the periphytic assemblage was enhanced by the experimental nutrient enrichment, resulting in decreased C:N and C:P ratios. The presence of herbivores also increased periphytic nutrient content (decreased N:P and C:P ratios) in some experiments, suggesting an increase in algal P due to excretion. The effect strength of grazers and nutrients on periphyton was affected by different abiotic characteristics such as light availability, nutrient concentrations, and temperature. However, single environmental characteristics were not sufficient to explain the relative importance of grazing and nutrients.

The Influence of Atmospheric Rivers on Cold-Season Precipitation in the Upper Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												This study aims to identify the impacts of atmospheric rivers (AR) associated with cold-season precipitation in the Upper Great Lakes region of the United States. A MERRA-2-derived AR dataset is combined with data from a suite of instruments hosted by the National Weather Service in Marquette, Michigan, including a profiling radar and a video disdrometer. ARs coincide with deep, synoptically-forced precipitation 28% of the time during the cold season. These ARs are found to intrude from the southwest and are associated with warmer surface and upper-level temperatures, increased radar reflectivity values, and enhanced precipitation rates. Warmer atmospheric temperatures aloft associated with ARs lead to a fourfold increase in the likelihood that cold-season precipitation will be rain instead of snow. Additionally, inland ARs in the Upper Great Lakes region are correlated with the negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Pacific-North American pattern. Plain Language Summary The Upper Great Lakes region of the United States experiences an abundance of snowfall each year. The National Weather Service in Marquette, Michigan closely monitors snowfall events due to the socioeconomic impact on the surrounding communities. Studies have shown that intrusions of enhanced levels of atmospheric water vapor, or "atmospheric rivers", lead to increased precipitation along oceanic coastlines and other parts of the interior United States. This study investigates the impact of atmospheric rivers on cold-season precipitation in the Upper Great Lakes region using ground-based observations from Marquette. We find that atmospheric rivers occur frequently during large-scale, deep precipitation events and are associated with enhanced precipitation rates, greater likelihood of rain instead of snow at the surface, and warmer temperatures. These events are also correlated with well-known climate variability patterns, which could aid forecasters in mid- and long-range prediction of these weather events. Key Points Deep, synoptically forced cold-season precipitation is frequently associated with atmospheric rivers (ARs) in the Upper Great Lakes region Precipitation rates are enhanced and rain is four times more likely to occur than snow if an AR is proximal Upper Great Lakes ARs are significantly correlated to negative phases of the Pacific-North American pattern and Pacific Decadal Oscillation					Pettersen, Claire/H-2687-2018; Kulie, Mark/C-3289-2011; L'Ecuyer, Tristan/E-5607-2012; Mattingly, Kyle/HMP-7305-2023	Pettersen, Claire/0000-0002-8685-6242; Henderson, Stephanie/0000-0001-7729-6506; Mattingly, Kyle/0000-0002-7384-0903; L'Ecuyer, Tristan/0000-0002-7584-4836; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 8	2021	126	13							e2021JD034754	10.1029/2021JD034754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JD034754													WOS:000704189400030

Multi-year individual-based analyses using genetically determined parentage allowed the examination of variables associated with the reproductive success of male and female lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in the well-studied population in Black Lake, Michigan, USA. Spawning lake sturgeon (a total of 599 individuals where many were captured more than once based on 1024 total captures) and larvae (N = 3436) were genotyped during each of seven consecutive years (2001-2007). Factors associated with individual reproductive success differed between sexes and varied among spawning groups within a year and among years depending on spawning date (higher reproductive success earlier in the season for females) and spawning locations (higher reproductive success in upstream spawning zones for females). Female reproductive success increased nonlinearly with increasing body size. Male reproductive success increased with increasing residence time in spawning areas and, to a modest degree, with increasing body size in a nonlinear fashion. Fixed effects of repeatability in spawn timing and location across years led to consistently higher or lower reproductive success for females. Results identified factors, including time spent at spawning areas by males and intersexual encounters and mate number, that contributed to higher interindividual variance in reproductive success and affected population levels of recruitment, the degree of subpopulation genetic structure (lack of isolation by time), and effective population size.

These particles are considered to be bacteriogenic; despite the importance of biogeochemical implications, however, the environmental factor responsible for their formation has not been identified. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the involvement of algal extracellular polysaccharides in Mn oxide particle formation. Based on this study of laboratory cultures of a model Mn(II)-oxidizing bacterium, the supply of algal extracellular mucilage was shown to stimulate Mn(II) oxidation and thus the production of filamentous Mn oxide particles. This observation was consistent with the results obtained for naturally occurring particles collected from a near-bottom layer (depth of approximately 90 m) in the northern basin of Lake Biwa, Japan, that is, most Mn particles resembling d-MnO2 were associated with an extracellular mucilage-like gelatinous matrix, which contained dead algal cells and was lectin-stainable. In the lake water column, polysaccharides produced by algal photosynthesis sank to the bottom layer. The analysis of the quality of water samples, which have been collected from the study site for 18 years, reveals that the annual average total phytoplankton biovolume in the surface layer correlates with the density of filamentous Mn particles in the near-bottom layer. Among different phytoplankton species, green algae appeared to be the key species. The results of this study suggest that algal extracellular polysaccharides serve as an important inducer for the formation of filamentous Mn oxide particles in the near-bottom layer of the northern basin of Lake Biwa.

However, few studies have investigated the long-term intra-annual trends in the number and area of small lakes and their driving mechanisms in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). As a significant water tower in northwest China, the Qilian Mountains region (QMR) in the QTP is essential for sustaining regional industrial and agricultural production, biodiversity, and human well-being. We conducted an analysis of the dynamics of small lakes in the QMR region. In this study, we employed Geodetector and examined nine factors to investigate the driving mechanisms behind the long-term variations in the small lake water bodies (SLWBs). We specifically focused on understanding the effects of single-factor and two-factor interactions. The results indicate that the number and area of small lakes had a fluctuating trend from 1987 to 2020. Initially, there was a decrease followed by an increase, which was generally consistent with trends in the large lakes on the QTP. All basins had far more expanding than shrinking lakes. The area of seasonal SLWBs in each basin was increasing more rapidly than permanent SLWBs. The distribution and trends in the area and number of small lakes varied widely across elevation zones. Runoff, snow depth, and temperature contributed the most to SLWB changes. Human activities and wind speed contributed the least. However, the main drivers varied across basins. The impact of two-factor interactions on SLWB changes in basins was greater than that of single factors. Our results provide useful information for planning and managing water resources and studies of small lakes.					; Dahong, Zhang/HPF-2003-2023; Chen, Rensheng/AHE-0550-2022; zhang, shiqiang/JMP-5376-2023	Zhang, Dahong/0000-0002-4046-7719; Zhang, Shiqiang/0000-0003-3407-6356; li, chao/0000-0002-7486-7884														2072-4292				JUL	2023	15	14							3604	10.3390/rs15143604	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15143604													WOS:001038850600001

However, little is known about the characteristics of nitrogen cycling during the ice-covered period in seasonally frozen lakes. In this study, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of subglacial water and sediment from Lake Ulansuhai was performed to identify and compare nitrogen metabolism pathways and microbes involved in these pathways. In total, ammonia assimilation was the most prominent nitrogen transformation pathway, and Bacteria and Proteobacteria (at the domain and phylum levels, respectively) were the most abundant portion of microorganisms involved in nitrogen metabolism. Gene sequences devoted to nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and ammonia assimilation were significantly higher in sediment than in surface and subsurface water. In addition, 15 biomarkers of nitrogen-converting microorganisms, such as Ciliophora and Synergistetes, showed significant variation between sampling levels. The findings of the present study improve our understanding of the nitrogen cycle in seasonally frozen lakes.					guohua, li/ABD-4825-2020; shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024; Cui, Zhimou/KOC-9369-2024	wang, yanjun/0000-0003-4222-1373; 														2073-4441				JUL	2023	15	13							2332	10.3390/w15132332	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15132332													WOS:001028198900001

Long-term trends in benthic invertebrate populations (1929-2013) in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Spatial, seasonal, and inter-annual variation in zoobenthos was examined in Lake Winnipeg which has experienced accelerated nutrient loading and multiple environmental stressors over the last several decades leading to increased overall productivity. Qualitative zoobenthos data (1928-29) and quantitative data (1969-2013), revealed two prevailing patterns: (1) a substantial increase in density, mainly Oligochaeta (Tubificinae), Mollusca (Sphaeriidae), and Diptera (Chironomidae) in the North basin, but a less consistent pattern of increase in density overall and of Ephemeroptera (Ephemeridae) and Trichoptera (Leptoceridae) in the South basin, and (2) disappearance of Amphipoda (Diporeia) from the South basin and a decline in Diporeia as a dominant taxon in the North basin, although it remained prevalent in the Narrows where higher total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations have persisted. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed that over time, inter-basin variation overwhelmed the seasonal component of variation in zoobenthos abundance. The benthic environment has changed (e.g. food resources, sediment particle sizes and nutrients) over the decades, contributing to the substantial changes in zoobenthos abundance and community composition that may constitute a regime change in the lake.

Photosynthetically-mediated calcite and phosphorus precipitation by submersed aquatic vascular plants in Lake Pleasant, Pennsylvania	AQUATIC BOTANY												Photosynthetically-mediated calcite precipitation by phytoplankton and charophytes has been shown to be a significant pathway for the removal of epilimnetic Ca and P in hardwater lakes, but the role of submersed aquatic vascular plants has not been examined. We measured calcite precipitation on 5 species of submersed aquatic vascular plants in moderately hardwater Lake Pleasant semi-monthly during the growing season. Maximum mass-specific accumulation ranged from 22.9 mg Ca g(-1) leaf dry weight in Megalodonta Beckii to 176.3 mg Ca g(-1) leaf dry weight in Potamogeton Richardsonii. Analysis of the crude deposits gave mean Ca concentration of 318 mg g(-1) dry wt., and mean total P concentration of 169.8 mu g g(-1) dry wt, however, only 38% of this total phosphorus was composed of chemical species specifically associated with Ca co-precipitation. We used whole lake estimates of submersed aquatic vascular plant mass to calculate the mass of P co-precipitated with Ca. Results suggest that in spite of conspicuous precipitate on plants during midsummer in this lake, there is a negligible effect on epilimnetic P concentrations.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				OCT	2017	143						36	40		10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.09.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2017.09.002													WOS:000413879100007

Population dynamics: seasonal variation of phytoplankton functional groups in Brazilian reservoirs (Billings and Guarapiranga, Sao Paulo)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton may function as a "sensor" of changes in aquatic environment and responds rapidly to such changes. In freshwaters, coexistence of species that have similar ecological requirements and show the same environmental requirements frequently occurs; such species groups are named functional groups. The use of phytoplankton functional groups to evaluate these changes has proven to be very useful and effective. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of functional groups of phytoplankton in two reservoirs (Billings and Guarapiranga) that supply water to millions of people in Sao Paulo city Metropolitan Area, southeastern Brazil. Surface water samples were collected monthly and physical, chemical and biological (quantitative and qualitative analyses of the phytoplankton) were performed. The highest biovolume (mm(3).L-1) of the descriptor species and functional groups were represented respectively by Anabaena circinalis Rabenh.

J	Ke, ZX; Xie, P; Guo, LG				Ke, Zhi-Xin; Xie, Ping; Guo, Long-Gen			Impacts of two biomanipulation fishes stocked in a large pen on the plankton abundance and water quality during a period of phytoplankton seasonal succession	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Silver and bighead carp were stocked in a large pen to control the nuisance cyanobacterial blooms in Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu. Plankton abundance and water quality were investigated about once a week from 9 May to 7 July in 2005. Biomass of both total crustacean zooplankton and cladocerans was significantly suppressed by the predation of pen-cultured fishes. There was a significant negative correlation between the N:P weight ratio and phytoplankton biomass. The size-selective predation by the two carps had no effect on the biomass of green alga Ulothrix sp. It may be attributed to the low fish stocking density (less than 40 g m(-3)) before June. When Microcystis dominated in the water of fish pen, the pen-cultured carps effectively suppressed the biomass of Microcystis, as indicated by the significant decline of chlorophyll a in the >38 mu m fractions of the fish pen. Based on the results of our experiment and previous other studies, we conclude that silver and bighead carp are two efficient biomanipulation tools to control cyanobacterial (Microcystis) blooms in the tropical/subtropical eutrophic waters. Moreover, we should maintain an enough stocking density for an effective control of phytoplankton biomass.

J	Karst-Riddoch, TL; Pisaric, MFJ; Smol, JP				Karst-Riddoch, TL; Pisaric, MFJ; Smol, JP			Diatom responses to 20th century climate-related environmental changes in high-elevation mountain lakes of the northern Canadian Cordillera	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Diatom responses to 20th century climate-related environmental change were assessed from three high-elevation lakes in the northern Canadian Cordillera. Dominance of small benthic Fragilaria diatoms reflect the generally cold conditions with long periods of ice cover that have characterized these mountain lakes over at least the last similar to 300 years until the period of recent warming. At the turn of the 20th century, salient shifts in the diatom assemblages reveal individualistic limnological responses with the onset of climate warming trends in northwest Canada. At YK3 Lake, an oligotrophic, chemically dilute, alpine lake, increased representation of the planktonic Cyclotella pseudostelligera may reflect longer ice-free conditions and/or more stable thermal strati. cation. By contrast, in the more productive, alkaline lakes (BC2 and Deadspruce lakes), changes to more diverse assemblages of periphytic diatoms suggest greater benthic habitat availability, most likely associated with the enhanced growth of aquatic plants with lengthening of the growing seasons. In addition, diatom assemblages from these lakes suggest less alkaline conditions following the onset of 20th century climate warming. Continued alkalinity reduction throughout the 20th century is qualitatively inferred at the lower elevation, treeline lake (Deadspruce Lake), while greater representation of alkaliphilous Fragilaria diatoms after similar to 1950 suggested increased alkalinity at the alpine BC2 Lake. Our results confirm the sensitivity of diatoms from high-elevation mountain lakes to regional climate change in northwest Canada. Individualistic limnological responses to 20th century warming are potentially attributed to differences in their physical setting (e. g., bedrock geology, elevation, catchment vegetation) in this complex mountain environment.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Pisaric, Michael/0000-0003-3806-8986; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2005	33	3					265	282		10.1007/s10933-004-5334-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-004-5334-9													WOS:000227704300002

However, the mechanisms through which engineering affects waterbirds are still unclear. To gain a better understanding of this issue, we conducted a three-year survey of waterbirds on Shanxinsha Island, which underwent restoration engineering, along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. We compared the seasonal migratory change among different species groups through and after the island restoration engineering. We observed a total monthly maximum count of 118,506 individuals from 61 waterbird species over the span of 38 months, including eight globally threatened species and five species that exceeded 1% of the flyway population. Throughout the survey periods, the average number of total waterbirds and small shorebirds observed during the migrating season decreased by 52.7 and 48.6%, respectively. The massive loss of high-tide roosting areas was the primary factor contributing to this decline. The combined effects of increased vegetation and deeper water levels resulted in a 38.8% reduction in exposed tidal flat area, as determined through land cover verification and fractional vegetation cover calculations. While tourism activities exhibited fewer negative consequences compared to island restoration engineering, they had a greater impact on small breeding shorebirds. Our study showed that small shorebirds were particularly susceptible to island restoration engineering, whereas large shorebirds and swimming birds were more flexible in their use of roosting or foraging sites. We suggest that the impact of future coastal engineering requires more detailed assessment and monitoring, especially for small migratory shorebirds.					zhang, wei/JHS-3591-2023; Jiang, Aiwu/ABC-8529-2021	Wen, Ke/0000-0002-1982-171X; Jiang, Aiwu/0000-0002-5259-298X; Junjie, Liu/0000-0002-6061-8430													1061-2971	1526-100X				NOV	2023	31	8								10.1111/rec.13974	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13974		JUN 2023											WOS:001021523400001

Temporal bacterial diversity and detection of putative methanotrophs in surface mats of Lonar crater lake	JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY												The phylogenetic diversity of bacterial communities in microbial mats of two different seasons from saline and hyperalkaline Lonar Lake was investigated using 16S rRNA gene library analysis. Arthrospira (Cyanobacteria) related clones (>80% of total clones) dominated libraries of both the seasons. Clear differences were found in both the seasons as the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to Fusibacter (LAI-1 and LAI-59) and Tindallia magadiensis (LAI-27) found in post-monsoon were not found in the pre-monsoon library. Likewise, OTUs related to Planococcus rifietensis (LAII-67), Bordetella hinzii (LAII-2) and Methylobacterium variabile (LAII-25) found in the pre-monsoon were not found in post-monsoon. The study was extended to identify methanotrophs in the surface mats. Libraries constructed with type I and type II methanotroph specific 16S rRNA gene primers showed the presence of clones (LAMI-99 and LAMII-2) closely related to Methylomicrobium buryaticum and Beijerinckiaceae family members. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting based on protein-coding genes (pmoA and mxaF) further confirmed the detection of Methylomicrobium sp. Hence, we report here for the first time the detection of putative methanotrophs in surface mats of Lonar Lake. The finding of clones related to organisms with interesting functional attributes such as assimilation of C-1 compounds (LAII-25, LAMI-39, LAMI-99 and LAMII-2), non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria (LAMII-43) and clones distantly affiliated to organisms of heavily polluted environments (LAI-59 and LAMII-52), is of significant note. These preliminary results would direct future studies on the functional dynamics of microbial mat associated food web chain in the extreme environment.

Atmospheric dry deposition of trace metals in the coastal region of Los Angeles, California, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Emissions of trace metals to the atmosphere and subsequent deposition, either directly to a waterbody surface or indirectly to the watershed as washoff during rainfall, represents a potential source of contamination to surface waters near urban centers. The present study provides measurements of atmospheric concentrations of particle-bound trace metals, and it estimates the dry deposition mass loading of trace metals in coastal watersheds in the Los Angeles, California, USA, air basin. Coarse-particle atmospheric concentrations of metals were measured seasonally using a Noll Rotary Impactor at six urban sites and one nonurban site. Dry deposition fluxes were calculated by summing the product of air concentration and the theoretical deposition velocity for each particle size fraction. Mean fluxes at urban sites ranged from 3.2 to 9.1, 11 to 34, 3.8 to 8.8, 8.3 to 29, and 69 to 228 mu g/ m(2)/d for chromium, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc, respectively. Mean concentrations and fluxes were significantly higher at urban sites compared with the nonurban site, although differences between urban and nonurban sites were reduced when sampling took place within 5 d after rainfall. Dry deposition to watershed land surfaces was substantial, representing a potentially large source of trace metals based on comparisons with load estimates from stormwater runoff.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				SEP	2006	25	9					2334	2341		10.1897/05-300R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/05-300R.1								16986787					WOS:000239912100010

Lake Batata is a typical clear-water Amazonian lake, located in the watershed of Trombetas River, Central Amazon, Brazil. Bacterial batch cultures were set up with 90% 0.2-mu m filtered water and 10% inoculum from Lake Batata. N-NH4NO3 and P-KH2PO4, with final concentrations of 50 and 5 mu M, respectively, were added to the cultures, except for controls. Extra sources of DOC (e.g., algal lysate, plant leachates) were added to constitute six distinct treatments. Bacterial response was measured by maximum bacterial abundance and rates of bacterial production, respiration, DOC uptake, and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). Bacterial growth and DOC uptake were higher in NP treatments than in controls, indicating a consistent nutrient limitation in Lake Batata. The composition of DOC also seems to be an important regulating factor of bacterial growth in Lake Batata. Seasonally, bacterial growth and DOC bioavailability were higher at low-water period, when the phytoplankton is a significant extra source of DOC, than at high-water period, when the forest is the main source of DOC. DOC bioavailability was better estimated based on the diversity and the diagenetic stage of carbon compounds than on single classes of labile compounds. Changes in BGE were better related to CNP stoichiometry in the water, and the "excess" of organic substrates was oxidized in catabolism, despite the quality of these compounds for bacterial growth. Finally, we conclude that bacterial growth and DOC uptake vary throughout the flood pulse in clear-water Amazonian ecosystems as a result of changes in nutrient concentration and in DOC composition.

Interactions between distal epiclastic and bio-chemogenic sedimentation at the foothills of a mafic alkaline volcano: The case of the Oligocene Doupovske Hory Volcanic Complex (Czech Republic)	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												Late Oligocene (ca 25 Ma) volcano-sedimentary successions exposed on the western periphery of the Doupovske Hory Volcanic Complex reveal a complex sedimentation history influenced in various ways by decay of the alkali basalt volcanic edifice. Weathering of the volcanic rocks supplied abundant reactants that promoted carbonate precipitation in the peripheral palaeolakes-as evidenced by strongly non-radiogenic Sr-87/Sr-86 values (0.7038-0.7041). On the other hand, the sediments of the initial shallow lake became deformed by the bulldozing effect of a debris avalanche. The debris flow and avalanche deposits filled up the original depression, modified the basin morphology and shifted the peripheral lacustrine setting further away from the volcano. At this stage, surface water influx from the surrounding granites conferred a more radiogenic character (Sr-87/Sr-86 values 0.7046-0.7049) to the calcrete deposits. Fossil assemblages as well as limestone textures suggest significant seasonal water-level fluctuations, possibly reflecting the alternating rainy and dry-seasons of a prevalently humid Central-European Late Oligocene climate. The seasonal drying out of the ponds resulted in significant O-18 enrichments. Although the ca 0 & PTSTHOUSND; & delta;C-13 values might suggest mixing of atmospheric and volcanic CO2 during carbonate precipitation, no active volcanic conduits of relevant age are known in the close vicinity. The lower & delta;C-13 values are likely a result of mantle degassing through rift faults, a phenomenon observed in the magmatically extinct Ohre Rift until present. This paper demonstrates that limestones derived from weathered alkaline basalts are characterised by highly non-radiogenic Sr isotopic ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86 ca 0.704), suggesting a magmatic origin for the Ca within these carbonates. Contrary to the notion of carbonatites being present when highly non-radiogenic Sr isotopes are found, these results show that Sr isotopes in carbonates formed in alkali basalt-sourced environments only reveal the source of the Sr (and Ca) ions, not necessarily the presence of carbonatite.					; Cap, Pavel/D-9621-2018; Benkó, Zsolt/AGB-1853-2022; Cvancarova, Zuzana/H-2896-2017; Erban Kochergina, Yulia V./E-8410-2017; Čvančarová, Zuzana/H-2896-2017; Rapprich, Vladislav/D-1223-2009; Petrash, Daniel/R-1150-2017; Sakala, Jakub/P-7744-2017; Erban Kochergina, Yulia/E-8410-2017	Petrash, Daniel/0000-0001-5039-0543; Cap, Pavel/0000-0002-5329-4765; Cvancarova, Zuzana/0000-0002-7080-9329; Erban Kochergina, Yulia V./0000-0002-3938-8810; Sakala, Jakub/0000-0001-8922-0832; 														2055-4877				NOV	2023	9	4					871	894		10.1002/dep2.240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dep2.240		JUN 2023											WOS:001017543100001

Semi-annual carbon and nitrogen isotope variations in the water column of Lake Bled, NW Slovenia	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The variability in the stable isotope signature of carbon and nitrogen in particulate organic matter and dissolved species in the water column of the mesotrophic sub-alpine Lake Bled in NW Slovenia has been determined. After the algae bloom from August to December in 2008, samples were taken from the deepest part of the lake which develops an anoxic hypolimnion for most of the year. C/N molar ratios and delta C-13(POC) and delta N-15(PN) values suggest an autochthonous source for particulate organic matter (POM). According to the isotope model, autochthonous carbon accounted for a major part of the particulate organic carbon (POC), ranging from 86% to 96% in September and October, while in December the proportion of allochthonous carbon was more pronounced, ranging from 57% to 59%. Low delta C-13(POC) and delta N-15(PN) values (from -36 to -33 parts per thousand and from 0.8 to 1.8 parts per thousand), observed below 24 m in August and September, indicate the bacterial origin of POM, mainly from methanotrophic bacteria. delta N-15(NO3) and delta N-15(PN) values decreased with depth. The relations between delta N-15(PN) and NO3- and NH4+ concentrations suggest that NH4+ is the main assimilation species for nitrogen in POM. Nitrification was active between 12 and 18 m deep in September and October, indicated by increased NO3- concentrations and decreased delta N-15(NO3) values. The correlation between nitrate concentrations and delta N-15(NO3) values suggests active water column denitrification in October 2008. The decrease in delta(NNO3)-N-15 values observed in December could be explained by degradation of organic matter, followed by nitrification of the degradation products. During our sampling period, there was no evident influence of sewage, agriculture, or atmospheric deposition on the nitrogen balance in the lake.					; Šturm, Martina/N-4232-2019; Bratkic, Arne/AAW-4669-2021	Bratkic, Arne/0000-0002-7810-1819; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2012	9	1					1	11		10.5194/bg-9-1-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-9-1-2012													WOS:000300229000001

Evaluation of lakewide, early season herbicide treatments for controlling invasive curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus) in Minnesota lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus) is a nonnative aquatic plant found throughout temperate regions of North America. Its early season growth, propensity to form dense surface mats, and ability to out-compete native aquatic plants allow it to degrade the ecological and recreational quality of many lakes. Consequently, there is great interest in adopting lakewide management strategies that can reduce the negative impacts of curlyleaf and provide long-term control. We collaborated with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources from 2006 through 2009 to evaluate lakewide, early season herbicide treatments for controlling curlyleaf. Nine curlyleaf-infested lakes were treated with endothall at 0.751.00 mg active ingredient per liter (ai/L) or fluridone at 24 mu g ai/L (only one lake treated with fluridone) for up to 5 consecutive years. Three additional infested lakes were selected to serve as untreated reference lakes. In each year we assessed the frequency and biomass of curlyleaf (May and Jun), documented the production of new curlyleaf turions on standing plants (Jun), and tracked changes in the abundance and viability of turions in lake sediments (Oct). We found that herbicide treatment inhibited turion production and substantially reduced curlyleaf frequency, biomass, and sediment turion abundance in treated lakes. The largest reductions of curlyleaf frequency, biomass, and turion abundance occurred in the initial 23 years of treatment, with less substantial reductions in the subsequent years of treatment. Despite these reductions, viable turions remained in the sediments of treated lakes after up to 5 consecutive years of treatment. These results suggest that although lakewide, early season herbicide treatments can effectively control curlyleaf, inhibit turion production, and reduce the abundance of turions in sediments, ongoing management will likely be required to maintain long-term control.

Present Lake Kivu phytoplankton is dominated by cyanobacteria - mainly Synechococcus spp. and thin filaments of Planktolyngbya limnetica - and by pennate diatoms, among which Nitzschia bacata and Fragilaria danica are dominant. Seasonal shifts occur, with cyanobacteria developing more in the rainy season, and the diatoms in the dry season. Other groups present are cryptophytes, chrysophytes, chlorophytes and dinoflagellates. According to a survey conducted in the period 2002-2008, the composition of the phytoplankton assemblage was quasi homogeneous among lake basins. The mean euphotic depth varied between 17 and 20 m, and the increase in the ratio between mixed layer depth and euphotic depth to about 2 in the dry season may have selected for diatoms and cryptophytes, which tended to present their maximal development in this season, when cyanobacteria slightly decreased. Mean chlorophyll a concentration was 2.16 mg m(-3), and the mean daily primary production was 0.62 g C m(-2) day(-1) (range, 0.14-1.92), i.e. in the same range as in other large oligotrophic East African Rift lakes. Seston elemental ratios indicated a moderate P-deficiency during the dry, mixed season and a severe P limitation during part of the rainy, stratified season; the C: N ratio indicated a moderate N limitation throughout the year. Nutrient addition assays pointed to a direct N-limitation and co-limitation by P during rainy seasons and P or N limitation during dry seasons depending on the year. Thus, phytoplankton ecology in Lake Kivu does not differ from that of other Rift lakes, where seasonal variations result in a trade-off between low light with high nutrient supply and high light with low nutrient supply. Phytoplankton production in Lake Kivu is also similar to that of other Rift lakes, and nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth may occur as a result of variable availability of N and P, as in Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi, even though the extent of P limitation seems greater in Lake Kivu.

Ananke: temporal clustering reveals ecological dynamics of microbial communities	PEERJ												Taxonomic markers such as the 16S ribosomal RNA gene are widely used in microbial community analysis. A common first step in marker-gene analysis is grouping genes into clusters to reduce data sets to a more manageable size and potentially mitigate the effects of sequencing error. Instead of clustering based on sequence identity, marker-gene data sets collected over time can be clustered based on temporal correlation to reveal ecologically meaningful associations. We present Ananke, a free and open-source algorithm and software package that complements existing sequence-identity-based clustering approaches by clustering marker-gene data based on time-series profiles and provides interactive visualization of clusters, including highlighting of internal OTU inconsistencies. Ananke is able to cluster distinct temporal patterns from simulations of multiple ecological patterns, such as periodic seasonal dynamics and organism appearances/disappearances. We apply our algorithm to two longitudinal marker gene data sets: faecal communities from the human gut of an individual sampled over one year, and communities from a freshwater lake sampled over eleven years. Within the gut, the segregation of the bacterial community around a food-poisoning event was immediately clear. In the freshwater lake, we found that high sequence identity between marker genes does not guarantee similar temporal dynamics, and Ananke time-series clusters revealed patterns obscured by clustering based on sequence identity or taxonomy.					; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024	Beiko, Robert/0000-0002-5065-4980; Rohwer, Robin/0000-0002-2664-6489													2167-8359					SEP 26	2017	5								e3812	10.7717/peerj.3812	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3812								28966891					WOS:000411715300002
J	Murphy, SW; de Souza, CR; Oppenheimer, C				Murphy, Samuel William; de Souza Filho, Carlos Roberto; Oppenheimer, Clive			Monitoring volcanic thermal anomalies from space: Size matters	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Measuring temperatures on volcanoes from space provides important constraints on the transfer of mass and heat to the Earth's surface. Time series of multispectral infrared images, acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) between 2000 and 2009, were inspected to investigate fluctuations in thermal anomalies at both Mount Erebus (Antarctica) and Lascar volcano (Chile). Several thermal metrics were explored: i) maximum pixel temperatures above background, ii) the spatial extent of low, moderate and high temperature anomalies, and iii) the spatial extent of short-wave infrared anomalies. The maximum pixel temperature metric correlated to eruptive events at Lascar volcano yet displayed significant scatter at Erebus. The spatial extent of both temperature and short-wave infrared anomalies correlates well with eruptive activity at both volcanoes. Limited variation in the size of thermal anomalies was observed at Erebus throughout the time series due to the stability of a long-lived lava lake, with the exception of a seasonal expansion in low temperature anomalies associated with localized snow-melt at the peak. This finding has implications for the interpretation of low temperature anomalies at other volcanoes. At least two different types of precursory signals are identified at Lascar: i) a gradual increase and ii) a dip, in the size and intensity of thermal anomalies. These thermal precursors appear to be associated with different eruptive styles. The former precedes a relatively shallow, short lived eruption; the later a prolonged eruptive period. Such thermal precursors could therefore help to constrain not only the timing but also the style and duration of an imminent eruptive episode. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Climatic triggers and phenological responses in Isoetes cangae (Isoetaceae), an endemic quillwort from Amazon Iron Rocky Outcrops, Brazil	LIMNOLOGICA												South America is the center of diversity of the genus Isoetes and several new species have been described in the last decade, especially in Brazil. Isoetes cangae J.B.S. Pereira, Salino & Stutzel was first recognized in 2016 as an endemic species of a single lake in Serra dos Carajas, Brazil, in the southeastern Amazon region. The climate of Amazon is warm with a seasonal precipitation regime, which affects aquatic ecosystem properties and regulates plant phenology. Understanding how climatic and hydrological drivers affect I. cangae is fundamental for its conservation because the species is quite vulnerable due to its restricted distribution. In this study, we evaluated the effects of seasonal climatic variations and water level on the phenology of I. cangae over two years. The maximum leaf length, the number of sporophylls (fertile leaves), and the total number of leaves were assessed. Sporophylls were classified into mature and immature, megasporophylls and microsporophylls. The number of leaves, leaf length, and the number of sporophylls changed drastically among the hydrological seasons, but not the ratio between sporophylls and leaves, suggesting that reproductive effort is distributed accordingly over the years. All these factors also varied between years, indicating that inter-annual climatic variations affect the morphology and reproduction of I. cangae. Sporophylls are produced throughout the year, but their maturation and release increase in the rainy and early dry seasons, respectively. Megasporophylls predominate over microsporophylls throughout the year, and the peak of sporophyll maturation occurs during the rainy season, but lasts longer (till early dry season) for megasporophylls. The reproductive traits were associated with lake water level, suggesting that development is stimulated during the driest and hottest periods. Therefore, our results show that environmental factors play an important role in I. cangae phenology and must be considered in the management and conservation efforts to preserve this ancient Amazonian plant.					; Gestinari, Lisia/MXL-7777-2025; Gripp, Anderson/AAB-8310-2019; da Rocha Gripp, Anderson/X-6987-2018	Martins, Rodrigo/0000-0001-8403-3990; MARINO GOMES DOS SANTOS, FERNANDO/0000-0002-8458-735X; Campos, Naiara Viana/0000-0003-4480-4484; da Rocha Gripp, Anderson/0000-0002-0099-6990													0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2021	89								125889	10.1016/j.limno.2021.125889	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2021.125889		JUL 2021											WOS:000670533800004

The most abundant fish species in this lake is the pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) valued due to the quality of its flesh and as a game fish. The aim of this study was to compare the gonadal stages of pejerrey during two consecutive spawning seasons (August to December) in relation to sexual steroids and temperature in this lake. In general, pejerrey gonadal development, the Gonadosomatic index and the plasma levels of estradiol and testosterone fluctuated in relation with temperature. In 2014 samplings, females started to ovulating in early August, with a peak during September-October and ending in December with many of them with atretic oocytes. However, in 2015, a marked delay in maturation was observed with ovulated fish only in October and December. This fact may be because the minors mean temperatures recorded in this year. For males, it was possible to find spermiating animals during the whole spawning season and only arrested animals in December. Unexpectedly, histological gonadal analysis revealed for the first time pejerrey with testis-ova, probably due to the intensive use of agrochemicals in this region.

However, little is known about their current status, local distribution, and responses to anthropogenic effects and environmental change. This study assessed the population status, spatiotemporal distribution, and factors affecting a population of the two crane species at 18 wetland sites in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. The result shows, wetlands used by the cranes were classified as slope, riverine, depressional, and lake fringe based on topographic positions, landforms and hydrologic conditions. A total of 304 black crowned cranes and 30 wattled cranes were recorded at the wetland sites over the study period. Statistically, the population status of the two crane species were significantly (P < .01) varied among the wetland sites in the non-breeding season, whereas this was not true for the breeding season. Spatially the wattled crane population was varied significantly (P < .01) among wetland sites throughout the study period (2013 - 2017) when black crowned crane population was varied significantly (P < .01) in most years. Likely, variation in the temporal distribution of the black crowned crane population was significant (P = .001) for the study period where the distribution of wattled crane was significant for the third and final year. A regression analyses revealed the presence of multiple anthropogenic and environmental variables with significant influence on the crane population, including crane-inhabiting wetland proximity to other wetlands, wetland size, wetland buffer area ownership and use (P < .01). Generally, promising numbers of the black crowned crane and wattled crane are found in Jimma Zone. For better conservation impact, there is a need for improved spatial planning and policy support to control crane habitat fragmentation resulting from infrastructure and urban development, wetland drainage, and buffer area mismanagement.

Diversity of Rotifera (Monogononta) and Egg Ratio of Selected Taxa in the Canals of Xochimilco (Mexico City)	WETLANDS												Rotifer dominance in wetland ecosystems is due to their ability to survive and reproduce in the presence of cyanobacteria, ability to occupy different niches and elimination of competing crustaceans by predation. In addition, quality and quantity of food and physical and chemical variables affect the rotifer abundances in these waterbodies. Seasonal variations in food also affect the rotifer body size and egg ratio (ER). We studied the species richness, diversity, female egg ratio, morphometry, and density of rotifer species from four sites of Lake Xochimilco that have been influenced by agriculture, urban waste, and tourism. Zooplankton samples were collected on a monthly basis over one year (February 2005 to January 2006) and we measured selected physical and chemical variables including water depth, Secchi transparency, temperature, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, hardness, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand-5day test (BOD5), nitrates and nitrites and orthophosphates. We recorded 81 rotifer species, representing 27 genera and 17 families. The Shannon-Wiener diversity varied between 0.5 and 3.8 during the study and was highest in the rainy season. The ER did not show a significant relationship between ecological conditions and any rotifer species, indicating nearly stable physical, chemical and biological conditions in which rotifers are able to reproduce throughout the year.

The Amazonian lowlands have forests in different successional stages, and a growing perception is that such heterogeneity results from long-term environmental changes. This hypothesis is investigated by designing an analytical model based on past and present-day vegetation and successions of the plant communities, combined with an advanced understanding of geological history. An area of southwestern Amazonia was selected for floristic inventories, and we interpreted the paleovegetation based on C/N and delta C-13 analyses of sedimentary organic matter. These data were examined in the context of the geological evolution on the basis of new sedimentological and chronological data. The topographically high Late Pleistocene deposits had continuous and highly diversified late-successional terra firme forests as well as local fluvial paleolandforms of younger ages with less diversified campinarana forests. Late Pleistocene-Holocene terrains in intermediate elevations had terra firme forests, but shorter trees with lower basal areas and ecotonal forests appeared near the confines of the forest-savanna, while Holocene deposits recorded only seasonally flooded varzea forests. Several deposits of Late Pleistocene and Late Pleistocene-Holocene age recorded an expansion of C-4 terrestrial plants before the establishment of the forest from similar to 20,000 cal yr BP to 7578 cal yr BP, which is not related to past arid episodes. We recorded forests with onsets at 6130-3533 cal yr BP, 3402-2800 cal yr BP, and 1624-964 cal yr BP to terra firme, varzea, and ecotonal forests, respectively. However, not all forests have reached maturity stages due to their location on terrains with a diverse history of terrace downcutting and deposition, which had a direct impact on local hydrology with the interaction of topographic gradients. The hydrology of the study area was also controlled by the distance from the main river valley. Capturing long-term disturbances over this region of still pristine forests may help elucidate the potential mechanisms that also determine trends in tree growth and forest diversity in other Neotropical regions.					; Yee, Marcio/N-9944-2013; Tatumi, Sonia/B-2711-2013; Toledo, Peter/P-3618-2015; Munita, Casimiro/F-4246-2014; Gribel, Rogerio/C-5392-2013	Yee, Marcio/0000-0002-7639-7265; Tatumi, Sonia Hatsue/0000-0002-4990-4444; de Souza Coelho, Luiz/0000-0001-6710-7660; Toledo, Peter/0000-0003-4265-2624; Munita, Casimiro/0000-0003-0546-1044; Gribel, Rogerio/0000-0002-0850-5578													2150-8925					OCT	2018	9	10							e02457	10.1002/ecs2.2457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2457													WOS:000449566200039

Freshwater copepod carcasses as pelagic microsites of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												A considerable fraction of freshwater zooplankton was recently found to consist of dead specimens that sink to the lake bottom. Such carcasses host intense microbial activities that may promote oxygen depletion at the microscale. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that sinking zooplankton carcasses are microsites of anaerobic nitrogen cycling that contribute to pelagic fixed-nitrogen loss even in the presence of ambient oxygen. Incubation experiments were performed with the ubiquitous copepods Eudiaptomus sp. and Megacyclops gigas at different ambient oxygen levels that sinking carcasses encounter during their descent in stratified lakes. N-15-stable-isotope incubations revealed intense carcass-associated anaerobic nitrogen cycling only at low ambient oxygen levels (<25% air saturation). Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) dominated over denitrification and thus the potential for fixed-nitrogen loss was low. Consistent with this partitioning of anaerobic nitrogen cycling, the relative abundance of the carcass-associated marker gene for DNRA (nrfA) was similar to 20-400 times higher than that for denitrification (nirS). Additionally, the relative nrfA and nirS abundances were similar to 90-180 times higher on copepod carcasses than in lake water. This functional distinctiveness of carcass-associated bacterial communities was further substantiated by 16S rDNA-based fingerprinting. We conclude that the unique bacterial communities and microenvironments provided by zooplankton carcasses influence pelagic nitrogen cycling in lakes, but mainly at seasonally low ambient O-2 levels in the bottom water.					; Thamdrup, Bo/F-3889-2016; Stief, Peter/C-1090-2017; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Treusch, Alexander/0000-0003-0074-3376; Stief, Peter/0000-0002-6355-150X; Lundgaard, Ann Sofie Birch/0000-0001-7479-7954; Glud, Ronnie N./0000-0002-7069-893X; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				OCT	2018	94	10							fiy144	10.1093/femsec/fiy144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy144								30060193					WOS:000448167900006

Moisture sensitivity of ecosystem respiration: Comparison of 14 forest ecosystems in the Upper Great Lakes Region, USA	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Ecosystem respiration (ER) was measured with the eddy covariance technique in 14 forest ecosystems in the Upper Great Lakes Region during the growing seasons of 2002 and 2003. The response of ER to soil temperature and moisture was analyzed using empirical models. On average, ER was higher in the intermediate and young than in the mature stands, and higher in hardwood than in conifer stands. The seasonal mean temperature-normalized respiration rate (R-10) ranged from 1 to 3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and seasonal mean activation energy (Ea) from 40 to 110 kJ mol(-1). The variation in the residuals of temperature response function of ER was best explained by soil moisture content. ER showed higher temperature sensitivity (as indicated by lower E,) in the young than in the mature stands of coniferous forests, but not in the hardwood forests. The inclusion of soil moisture as an explicit driver of R-10 explained an additional 8% (range 0-21%) of variability in ER. Significant moisture sensitivity of ER was detected in only 5 out of 20 site-years and it was associated with bimodal soil moisture distribution. Moisture sensitivity could partially be predicted from statistical moments kurtosis and interquartile range. The data implied greater moisture sensitivity with increasing stand age, possibly due to faster depletion of soil water supplies from a greater evaporative surface in the older stands. Additional limiting factors to ER were implicated. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Carbon and oxygen fluxes from a small pond to the atmosphere:: Temporal variability and the CO2/O2 imbalance	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Because of the relative strength of sediment processes compared to water column processes, natural and anthropogenic ponds represent an important component of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle and a site for recycling carbon to the atmosphere. Over 250 d of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were measured on the 0.5 h timescale in a small Connecticut pond. Using approximately 8000 half-hour time intervals, Mirror Lake (Storrs, Connecticut) exhibits net annual fluxes for 2002 and 2003 of 80 and 86 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (+/- 26%) and 25 and -7.5 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) (+/- 20%), respectively ( positive flux is to the atmosphere). The instantaneous ( 0.5 h) fluxes of both CO2 and O-2 to the atmosphere exhibit a standard deviation in the flux (measured every 0.5 h) of the order 100%, indicating a high degree of daily, weekly, and seasonal variability in the controlling processes, and the two gases rarely follow Redfield ratio stoichiometry. This net carbon flux to the atmosphere agrees with the range of carbon fluxes from various shallow inland aquatic waters. Using CO2 and O-2 mass balances, the minimum bacterial production of CO2 in the pond is estimated to be 100 and 81mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) for 2002 and 2003 (same order as the net CO2 flux from the pond), indicating the importance of the bacterial processes in pond carbon dynamics. Bacterial pathways that utilize NO3-1 or fermentation strongly favor CO2 production relative to O2 consumption and may provide a mechanistic explanation for the ( instantaneous to annual) CO2 to O-2 imbalance relative to the Redfield ratio. Thus, while natural and man-made ponds do provide advantages for flood control, sediment settling, and some degree of contaminant removal, ponds may also provide a locus for the processing of terrestrial carbon into a CO2 source to the atmosphere. Given the number of small ponds and their location in the hydrologic cycle, pond systems represent a coupling of hydrology and the carbon cycle worthy of greater investigation.

In this study, coastal tundra fluxes of methyl halides (CH3Cl, CH3Br, and CH3I) and methane (CH4) were measured near Barrow, Alaska (71 degrees N, 157 degrees W) during the 2005 growing season. Sites covered a range of microtopographic features including drained lake basins, channels, and high- and low-centered ice-wedge polygons. CH3Cl and CH3Br fluxes varied significantly with hydrologic conditions, with progressively higher net uptake rates observed with decreasing soil saturation. Drained tundra sites averaged - 620 nmol CH3Cl m(-2) d(-1) and - 9.8 nmol CH3Br m(-2) d(-1) while flooded tundra sites averaged -14 nmol CH3Cl m(-2) d(-1) and + 1.1 nmol CH3Br m(-2) d(-1). CH3Cl and CH3Br fluxes were positively correlated with each other as well as with CH4 emissions, suggesting that consumption of both compounds occurs primarily in aerobic environments. Average CH3I net emissions were relatively weak (4.0 nmol m(-2) d(-1)). Average methane fluxes (2.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and their relationship with soil moisture were comparable to tundra emissions reported by prior studies. Methane fluxes showed a marked seasonality, with emissions tripling between early and late in the growing season, but methyl halide fluxes did not show a similar temporal trend. If these measurements are representative of the Arctic tundra, then the Arctic tundra is a regionally important sink for CH3Cl and CH3Br but a trivial source of CH3I.

Many studies have evaluated the inclination to conserve watersheds, forest areas, or certain species. In this study, we reported the economical values of medicinal species based on the perceptions of locals living within a protected area in a seasonal dry tropical forest in Northeastern Brazil. Moreover, we assessed the effects of socioeconomic variables (gender, family income, and family size) on the WTA compensation for not using the species. We interviewed 96 household heads from seven communities to obtain their socioeconomic data and WTA values. Additionally, we used data from a plant inventory to gather information on species abundance. We found that the selected socioeconomic variables are a poor predictor of the WTA values. Our findings also demonstrate that women accept lower WTA values to not use some species. Additionally, individuals from bigger families accept lower WTA values to not use just one of the plant species. Species abundance did not influence informants' WTA values. Generally, informants overestimated bids, which may hinder biodiversity conservation. Socioeconomic and ecological factors may not have an influence on WTA values in communities that inhabit protected areas.

Effects of loss of perennial lake ice on mixing and phytoplankton dynamics: insights from High Arctic Canada	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Perennially ice-covered lakes are well known from Antarctica and also occur in the extreme High Arctic. Climate change has many implications for these lakes, including the thinning and disappearance of their perennial ice cover. The goal of this study was to consider the effects of transition to seasonal ice cover by way of limnological observations on a series of meromictic lakes along the northern coastline of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. Conductivity temperature profiles during a rare period of ice-free conditions (August 2008) in these lakes suggested effects of wind-induced mixing of their surface freshwater layers and the onset of entrainment of water at the halocline. Sampling of the mixed layer of one of these meromictic lakes in May and August 2008 revealed a pronounced vertical structure in phytoplankton pigments and species composition, with dominance by cyanobacteria, green algae, chrysophytes, cryptophytes and dinoflagellates, and a conspicuous absence of diatoms. The loss of ice cover resulted in an 80-fold increase in water column irradiance and apparent mixing of the upper water column during a period of higher wind speeds. Zeaxanthin, a pigment found in cyanobacteria, was entirely restricted to the <3 mu m cell fraction at all depths and increased by a factor of 2-17, with the greatest increases in the upper halocline region subject to mixing. Consistent with the pigment data, picocyanobacterial populations increased by a factor of 3, with the highest concentration (1.65 x 10(8) cells L(-1)) in the upper halocline. Chlorophyll a concentrations and the relative importance of phytoplankton groups differed among the four lakes during the open-water period, implying lake-specific differences in phytoplankton community structure under ice-free conditions.

The aim of this study was to analyze phylogenetic diversity (PD) patterns of orchid bee assemblages along a latitudinal gradient of 15 degrees from northern Peru to central Bolivia and to relate them to climatic factors and geological history. We expanded an existing phylogeny of orchid bees and analyzed the PD of 15 orchid bee assemblages along a latitudinal gradient using mean pair-wise phylogenetic distance. The resulting pattern was correlated to climatic factors and elevation. We found a hump-shaped pattern of PD that peaked in central Peru and decreased towards the equatorial and especially towards the southern, subtropical sites. The decrease in PD towards higher latitudes is a common pattern found in many taxa, which in our case correlates with increasing climatic seasonality. However, the decrease towards the equatorial sites is unusual and may be related to a particular historic event: the northern sites with low PD are situated in the area of the former Lake Pebas, which covered western Amazonia until 3 mya. After the lake disappeared orchid bees mainly belonging to two distantly related species groups apparently colonized the region and diversified, which led to the comparatively low observed PD. In contrast, in central Peru, no in situ radiations were detected, hence the assemblages were composed of species from diverse phylogenetic lineages. Additionally, we identified multiple phylogenetically independent radiations of regionally restricted Euglossa species along the latitudinal gradient that, according to a published, dated phylogeny, diversified roughly 3-1 mya. The hump-shaped latitudinal pattern of PD of the orchid bees of western Amazonia thus appears to have resulted from a preponderance of early divergent lineages in central Peru and of young radiations from distantly related clades colonizing higher latitudes, possibly triggered by historic climate fluctuations and major geological events.

In situ nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted to investigate the spatial and seasonal patterns of size-fractionated phytoplankton growth in Lake Taihu. Growth rates were significantly higher in western Taihu than in Meiliang Bay, except in May and September. In western Taihu, phytoplankton growth was only slightly limited by phosphorus. In Meiliang Bay, phytoplankton growth was phosphorus limited during May-July, whereas it was nitrogen limited during August-September. Switching between phosphorus and nitrogen limitation closely followed the seasonal fluctuations in levels of these nutrients. Phytoplankton in the large-size fraction tended to dominate the phytoplankton communities during the Microcystis blooms, although the growth rate of the small-size fraction was significantly higher than that of the large-size fraction. Our results demonstrate that nitrogen and phosphorus levels control the phytoplankton growth patterns in Lake Taihu, and that colonial Microcystis may be critical to maintain blooms under nutrient-limited conditions.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2014	36	3					709	721		10.1093/plankt/fbt131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbt131													WOS:000336490000010

Patterns of snow, deposition, and soil nutrients at multiple spatial scales at a Rocky Mountain tree line ecotone	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The forest-alpine tundra ecotone in the Front Range of Colorado typically occurs as a gradual transition from the treeless tundra to the closed canopy coniferous subalpine forest. We evaluated the patterns of snow, deposition inputs, and soil properties at three spatial scales: across the entire ecotone, with distance from tree limit in the transitional krummholz zone, and around individual trees. Snow depth was deepest in the krummholz zone and lowest in the alpine tundra and upwind of trees near tree limit, but was not predictive of most soil properties except for surface litter decomposition. Inorganic deposition ranged from 0.7 to 7.7 g m(-2) yr(-1) across the ecotone and tended to be higher downwind than upwind of trees. The exchangeable acid cation concentrations were significantly higher in the forest and increased gradually toward the tundra. The exchangeable base cations (Ca, Mg, and K) were only predictable at the scale of individual trees with greater concentrations downwind of trees. Resin bag available N was rarely predictable at any spatial scale, but was correlated among seasons. While the ecotone is in many ways a gradual transition from alpine tundra to subalpine forest, patterns observed across this vegetation gradient were often replicated on the scale of individual trees: downwind of trees was more similar to the forest, and upwind of trees was more similar to the tundra. No single spatial scale or gradient can provide uniform generalities about the amounts or fluxes of materials that determine the soil properties of this ecotone.					; Seastedt, Tim/AAG-1100-2019	LIPTZIN, DANIEL/0000-0002-8243-267X; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT 21	2009	114								G04002	10.1029/2009JG000941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JG000941													WOS:000271132100001

A NEW TREMATOPID AMPHIBIAN (TEMNOSPONDYLI: DISSOROPHOIDEA) FROM THE UPPER PENNSYLVANIAN OF WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA: EARLIEST RECORD OF TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATES RESPONDING TO A WARMER, DRIER CLIMATE	ANNALS OF CARNEGIE MUSEUM												Fedexia striegeli, a new genus and species of trematopid temnospondyl amphibian, is described on the basis of a single specimen that includes the greater portion of the skull and articulated portions of both mandibles and the atlas-axis complex. The holotype was collected from Upper Pennsylvanian-early Virgilian strata assignable to the lower part of the Casselman Formation of the Conemaugh Group in western Pennsylvania. This is not only the first trematopid to be reported from the State of Pennsylvania, but also, in addition to Actiobates Eaton, 1973, and Anconastes Berman et al., 1987, only the third reported Late Pennsylvanian member of the family that otherwise has a greater Early Permian representation. A cladistic analysis of the Dissorophoidea was performed utilizing primarily cranial characters and only members of Amphibamidae, Trematopidae, and Dissorophidae that are well represented in this field of inquiry. This includes Ecolsonia Vaughn, 1969, whose relationships to the latter two families have been controversial. The resultant cladogram depicts: I) Fedesia to be nested within a monophyletic Trematopidae as the sister taxon to the terminal dichotomy of Anconastes and Tambachia Sumida et al., 1998; 2) Trematopidae and Dissorophidae as forming monophyletic sister clades; and 3) Ecolsonia, Dissorophus Cope, 1895, and Broiliellus Williston, 1914, as forming an unresolved, terminal trichotomy within the dissorophid clade. Fedexia is representative of a wide variety of Late Pennsylvanian, medium-to-large amphibian and amniote tetrapods that record the earliest occurrence of vertebrates adapted to a terrestrial existence in North America. It is hypothesized that this biotic event was in response to the final stage of a long-term, global climatic trend toward drier conditions during the Pennsylvanian from perhumid to humid during the Early and Middle Pennsylvanian to dry subhumid or semiarid in the latest Virgilian. The lattermost climatic stage, which was also coincident with a marked retreat of the southern polar hemisphere glaciers during the late Paleozoic Ice Age, was followed by a strong and progressive reversal of the climate and an advance of the southern hemisphere glaciers to conditions characteristic of the earlier Pennsylvanian. Climatic changes during the Pennsylvanian are chronicled not only by major changes in rock types and associated lithologies, but also by a shift in the biology of the vertebrates they preserve. Middle Pennsylvanian vertebrates are characterized by large, diverse assemblages of predominantly small, aquatic amphibians and fish preserved in black shales and cannel coals associated with coal-forming and sapropelic fluvial sediments that developed in permanently wet, abandoned river channels. In contrast, the terrestrially adapted vertebrates of the Missourian-Virgilian Pennsylvanian are typically preserved in thin deposits of freshwater limestone or their closely associated pal eosols that are interpreted as representing seasonally dry lake deposits. Yet, aquatic amphibians continue to be a major constituent of Late Pennsylvanian vertebrate assemblages.																			0097-4463	1943-6300				MAR 15	2010	78	4					289	318																WOS:000275971600001

The study area covers a large territory from arctic tundra in the north to boreal forest on the western slopes of the Ural mountains in the south. pH was reconstructed using a diatom-based model. The degrees of compositional turn-over and rates-of-change were estimated numerically. The 20th century diatom floristic shifts, the rise in diatom accumulation rates and the rates of diatom compositional change in the northern Ural lakes correlate well with June temperature in the region and with the overall circum-arctic temperature increase from the 1970s. The main driving force behind diatom compositional shifts in the study lakes are the changes in the duration of ice-free season, timing of water turn-over and stratification periods and habitat availability. Changes in spheroidal carbonaceous particles show no pronounced effect on diatom assemblages. Pollution is restricted to regional sources originating mainly from the Vorkuta coal industry. Changes in diatom plankton are more pronounced than changes in diatom benthos. There is no clear north-south gradient in degree of compositional changes, with greatest changes occurring in Lake Vankavad situated in northern boreal forest. The degree of the 20th century diatom changes in Lake Vankavad is greater than in most circum-arctic and sub-arctic lakes from northern Europe and Canada. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jensen, JP; Pedersen, AR; Jeppesen, E; Sondergaard, M				Jensen, Jens Peder; Pedersen, Asger Roer; Jeppesen, Erik; Sondergaard, Martin			An empirical model describing the seasonal dynamics of phosphorus in 16 shallow eutrophic lakes after external loading reduction	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Based on monthly mass balances on 7-8 yr of data from 16 shallow (mean depth: 1-10 m), eutrophic, unstratified, or only temporarily stratified Danish lakes, we developed a simple empirical model relating the seasonal variation in lake total phosphorus (TP) concentrations to external loading, accumulated phosphorus in the sediment, hydraulic retention time, and water temperature. The aim was to describe the early recovery phase following an external loading reduction, i.e., when internal phosphorus loading is high, and to include seasonal dynamics. We calibrated a common set of model parameters for all 16 lakes and lake-specific estimates of the exchangeable phosphor-us pool in the sediment (P-s). Estimated annual mean TP deviated on average 12% from observed values in the 16 lakes. Moreover, the estimated seasonal dynamics and trend following the external loading reduction closely mimicked the observed pattern. The model was successfully tested on nine of the lakes for which data were available for an additional 7-yr period. The results suggest that TP in the sediment does not provide an adequate description of the exchangeable P pool. In Lake Arreskov, which has shifted from a turbid to a clear-water state following fish kill and biomanipulation, the model significantly overestimated TP, indicating that the model is inadequate for describing seasonal dynamics during the shift from a turbid to a clear-water state. Although simple, the empirical model predicts reasonably well the seasonal dynamics of TP following a P-loading reduction in a variety of shallow turbid lakes.

Spatiotemporal variation in wetland fish assemblages in the Western Ghats region of India	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												The Western Ghats region of peninsular India contains high diversity of freshwater fishes that support artisanal fisheries, but no studies to date have investigated fish assemblages of the region's extensive wetlands. This study examined fish population densities and the structure of local species assemblages in pools of the Periyakulam wetland of the Western Ghats. From 2000 to 2001, fishes and local abiotic environmental parameters were surveyed during three periods with contrasting rainfall (dry, major wet, minor wet). We hypothesized that fish density would be higher during the dry season when aquatic habitat is reduced, and that local assemblage structure would be strongly associated with habitat conditions. Total fish densities were higher during the dry season, but the magnitude of seasonal change was relatively low, and this apparently was because changes in water depth were minimal due to operation of sluice gates that control wetland hydrology. Chanda nama, Pseudetroplus maculatus, Rasbora daniconius, and Danio aequipinnatus were dominant species in most habitats during all three seasons. Multivariate ordinations revealed strong associations between assemblage structure and habitats based on vegetation cover. Local assemblages in shallow-vegetated habitats varied seasonally in association with gradients of rainfall and water quality parameters. Spatial variation of local fish assemblages in the Periyakulam wetland appears to be maintained by species-specific habitat selection. Although hydrologic regulation probably has reduced seasonal variation in the structure of local assemblages, seasonal differences still occur and appear to be caused by species differences with regard to periods of reproduction, recruitment, dispersal and habitat selection.

Behavioral response as a predictor of seasonal depth distribution and vertical niche separation in freshwater phytoplanktonic flagellates	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The distribution of phytoplanktonic flagellates in aquatic ecosystems has been widely attributed to a number of driving factors. In this study, we evaluated the influence of behavior on the daytime, seasonal depth distribution and vertical niche separation of five phylogenetically contrasting species of freshwater flagellates. A model predicting distribution was formulated using the dominant behavioral preferences for light, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, previously quantified in laboratory experiments, and was subsequently applied to the physical and chemical conditions measured in a small, strongly stratifying, hypertrophic lake. This model predicted the daytime depth distributions of natural populations of flagellates well, with an average areal fit of above 56% for all species; above 74% for Ceratium furcoides, Chlamydomonas sp., and Dinobryon sertularia; and of up to 93% during stratification. Regression analyses showed no significant variation from a 1:1 relationship between the predicted and observed average depths of species in the water column. The model also predicted the constriction into discrete vertical niches upon stratification and delineated the progression from Plagioselmis nannoplanctica in surface waters, through C furcoides and D. sertularia, to Chlamydomonas sp. and Euglena gracilis deeper in the water column. Changes in observed distributions could not be directly correlated with other members of the plankton community or explained by the segregation of nutrients. The model's wider, transferable applicability suggested that behavioral response to environmental gradients may predict many patterns of distribution, particularly during stratification. In addition to known physiological and biochemical influences, this investigation emphasized the importance of behavioral response in the functional ecology of phytoplanktonic flagellates.					; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011; Maberly, Stephen/J-3361-2012	Clegg, Mark/0000-0002-1683-1066; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2007	52	1					441	455		10.4319/lo.2007.52.1.0441	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.1.0441													WOS:000243795400038
J	Loubere, P; Creamer, W; Haas, J				Loubere, Paul; Creamer, Winifred; Haas, Jonathan			Evolution of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation in the late Holocene and insolation driven change in the tropical annual SST cycle	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												South American lake sediment records indicate that El Nino events in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) became more frequent after 3000 calendar years BP. The reason for this evolution of ENSO behavior remains in question. An important trigger for ocean-atmosphere state switching in the tropical ocean is the annual cycle of sea surface temperature south of the equator along the margin of South America. This annual cycle can be reconstructed from the oxygen isotope records of the surf clam Mesodesma donacium. We provide evidence that these isotope records, as preserved in archeological deposits in coastal central Peru, reflect seasonal paleo-SST. We find that the annual SST cycle in the eastern equatorial Pacific became larger over the 4500-2500 calendar year BP interval. This is consistent with increased ENSO variability. The magnification of the annual SST cycle can be attributed to changing insolation, indicating that ENSO is sensitive to the intensity and seasonal timing of solar heating of the southern EEP.

However, the application of this concept to subtropical plateau lakes has rarely been reported. In this study, 16 sampling sites were selected across the entirety of Lake Fuxian, Yunnan, China. Eighteen phytoplankton functional groups (F, G, J, X2, X1,T, P, MP, D, C, H1, L-O, S1, M, Y, E, W1 and W2) were classified according to the investigation of surface water and gradient depth samples. Nine of these groups, namely L-O, H1, C, MP, P, T, X1, J and F, were identified as dominant species (>5% total biomass). Furthermore, L-O, H1 and T were considered predominant (accounting for the maximum percentage of biomass in each month). The sampling showed that the seasonal succession of predominant assemblages in surface water was T (October) to H1 (January) to H1 (April) to Lo (July) and T+Lo (October) to T (January) to H1 (April) to Lo (July) in the gradient depth water. Redundancy analysis (RDA) combined with the indicator function of the phytoplankton groups suggested that WT and TN/TP were important factors in driving the succession of predominant assemblages all year around. The concept of phytoplankton functional groups was well applicable in our study of Lake Fuxian and it was suggested that predominant assemblages succession were acting as T (October) to H1 (January) to H1 (April) to Lo (July). Furthermore, according to RDA analysis, it was indicated that WT and TN/TP might be key driving factors in the phytoplankton changes of Lake Fuxian.

High niche overlap between two successfully coexisting pairs of Lake Malawi cichlid fishes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Many species in high-diversity assemblages appear to coexist in similar ecological niches. It has been proposed that interspecific resource partitioning in these assemblages may only occur during periods of resource scarcity. We tested this hypothesis by measuring resource abundance, dietary overlap, foraging rate, and territoriality in a Lake Malawi rock cichlid assemblage over a period of 1 year. Our study examined two pairs of morphologically similar species, with each pair comprising one native species and one invader species that has successfully established after being translocated from another region of the lake. All four species changed their diet and foraging rate in response to seasonal variation in resource abundance. However, dietary overlap within both species pairs remained high in all seasons and was not influenced by resource availability. Similarly, territoriality did not decline during periods of low resource availability, suggesting no decrease in the strength of interspecific competition. These data suggest that these species pairs are successfully coexisting despite substantial niche overlap during resource scarcity. Thus, the coexistence of species within this radiation may not depend on the evolution of divergent resource use patterns.

The long-term water use efficiency (WUE) of leaves is an important indicator for evaluating the water adaptation strategy of sand-fixing species. However, the WUE of typical sand-fixing plants in the alpine desert and its responses to local climatic, micro-geomorphology, environmental conditions and nutrient limitations are still unclear. In this study, sandfixing vegetation community along a revegetation chronosequence (Hippophae rhammoides planted on dunes in 1987, 2008, and 2015, respectively. H. rhammoides with the longest recovery period were defined as mature plantations, and the shortest recovery period were defined as juveniles.) at the alpine desert at the eastern shore of the Qinghai Lake were used as the research plots. Stable carbon isotope was used to evaluate species WUE. The results showed that: (1) the 813C values of H. rhammoides showed a decreasing trend as plants grew. The seasonal 813C variation was mainly affected by average relative humidity (MRH). (2) The 813C in the dunes revegetated in 2008 and 2015 were significantly higher than that in 1987 at the windward slope (P < 0.05). The values of 813C had various responses to the available soil water under the influence of topography, and soil water content was the key factor for the WUE of individuals in communities. There was a significant negative correlation between the ratio of carbon and nitrogen content in H. rhammoides leaves and WUE. The research indicated that mature plantations had adopted a more stable water use pattern than the juveniles, which provide an effective insight for ecological restoration in fragile ecological regions.

Potential water sources were divided into direct or internal (i.e. soil water at different depths) and indirect or external water sources (i.e. precipitation, river water and groundwater). The results indicated that the surface soil water delta O-18 and delta H-2 is enriched probably due to evaporation. Ginkgo biloba and Green soybean prefer using soil water from the upper soil layer (0-60 cm) and precipitation, and the Mulberry tree mainly used deep soil water (120-150 cm) and groundwater. The different water use strategies of the three plant species are likely to be determined by their different root distribution at the above correspondent soil depths.					; zheng, hao/HHM-6949-2022; Xin, Tian/KFQ-2466-2024; Wang, Chao/GXF-8353-2022; wang, pei/MTG-1182-2025; Liao, Xiaolin/H-3029-2013; , 袁伟皓/AAF-9458-2020	Liao, Xiaolin/0000-0001-5095-2059; Qian, Jin/0000-0002-9368-387X; 													0954-2299	2047-6523				SEP 11	2017	29	1					153	160		10.1080/09542299.2017.1373035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09542299.2017.1373035													WOS:000423054000001

Relationships between stream nitrate concentration and spatially distributed snowmelt in high-elevation catchments of the western US	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study compares stream nitrate (NO3-) concentrations to spatially distributed snowmelt in two alpine catchments, the Green Lakes Valley, Colorado (GLV4) and Tokopah Basin, California (TOK). A snow water equivalent reconstruction model and Landsat 5 and 7 snow cover data were used to estimate daily snowmelt at 30 m spatial resolution in order to derive indices of new snowmelt areas (NSAs). Estimates of NSA were then used to explain the NO3- flushing behavior for each basin over a 12 year period (19962007). To identify the optimal method for defining NSAs and elucidate mechanisms underlying catchment NO3- flushing, we conducted a series of regression analyses using multiple thresholds of snowmelt based on temporal and volumetric metrics. NSA indices defined by volume of snowmelt (e.g., snowmelt <= 30 cm) rather than snowmelt duration (e.g., snowmelt <= 9 days) were the best predictors of stream NO3- concentrations. The NSA indices were better correlated with stream NO3- concentration in TOK (average R-2 = 0.68) versus GLV4 (average R-2 = 0.44). Positive relationships between NSA and stream NO3- concentration were observed in TOK with peak stream NO3- concentration occurring on the rising limb of snowmelt. Positive and negative relationships between NSA and stream NO3- concentration were found in GLV4 with peak stream NO3- concentration occurring as NSA expands. Consistent with previous works, the contrasting NO3- flushing behavior suggests that streamflow in TOK was primarily influenced by overland flow and shallow subsurface flow, whereas GLV4 appeared to be more strongly influenced by deeper subsurface flow paths.

Limnological variability and pelagic fish abundance (Stolothrissa tanganicae and Lates stappersii) in Lake Tanganyika	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The abundance of two main pelagic fish species in Lake Tanganyika (Stolothrissa tanganicae and Lates stappersii) has always been observed to fluctuate considerably at different time scales. The inverse correlation between the abundance of these species has often been interpreted as the consequence of predator-prey relations (avoidance behaviour by the prey). However, currently the two species often appear spatially segregated in the lake, S. tanganicae dominating in the north while L. stappersii is generally abundant in the south where it feeds mostly on shrimps. A fluctuating abundance of the species is nevertheless observed. As these fish species have a major importance for the fisheries, we investigated the limnological variability in relation to the short-term variability of fish catches. The abundance of S. tanganicae was positively correlated to plankton biomass (r = 0.65), while water transparency (r = 0.56), depth of mixed layer (r = -0.70) and oxygenated water appeared important drivers for the abundance of L. stappersii. Alternating "mixing" and "stable" states of the epilimnion related to seasonal and internal waves variability are probably determinant for the short-term variability in abundance of S. tanganicae and L. stappersii. In the framework of this study, remote sensing has shown a potentially interesting application for fisheries research at Lake Tanganyika. We observed a close correspondence between phytoplankton blooms at the time of trade winds changes and increased catches of S. tanganicae in the south. The anti-correlated abundance of S. tanganicae and L. stappersii probably mainly reflects the underlying fluctuating limnological environment. Fisheries studies need to integrate limnological and planktonic monitoring to better understand large and complex ecosystems such as Lake Tanganyika.

Predicting the habitat expansion of the invasive roach Rutilus rutilus (Actinopterygii, Cyprinidae), in Great Britain	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The roach is influential ecologically and has a preference for water temperatures > 12A degrees C. In this study, we attempted to predict its habitat expansion in response to global warming, hypothesing its increase in Great Britain. Historical data for air temperature over different time scales (annual, seasonal, monthly and daily) and for the presence of roach in Great Britain were used to create four Ecological Niche Models. Mean seasonal air temperature (EncRoach-S) was the best predictor. Using EncRoach-S, two future climate scenarios were tested: a sensitivity test (i.e. incrementally increasing temperature values by 1A degrees C), and using air temperature data from UKCIP 11-member ensemble of climate change projections for 2031-2040, 2061-2070 and 2091-2100. Both approaches predicted an increase in habitat suitability in Great Britain with rising air temperatures but the extent of change differed for England, Wales and Scotland. In England, the rate of expansion was initially slow but rapidly increased mid-century leading to 88% coverage by the century end. In Wales, there was a greater increase by the century end and a similar trend in Scotland. This study supports the conjecture that a rise in air temperature over the next few decades will lead to an increase in potential roach habitat.

J	Roberts, S; Jones, VJ; Allen, JRM; Huntley, B				Roberts, Sarah; Jones, Viv J.; Allen, Judy R. M.; Huntley, Brian			Diatom response to mid-Holocene climate in three small Arctic lakes in northernmost Finnmark	HOLOCENE												Palaeoclimatic reconstructions from lake sediment biological records can be challenging, due to variation in non-climatic factors, which alter ecosystem responses. To consider this, it is important to replicate a study regionally, so as to gain information on spatial variability of ecosystem response and the influence of site-specific conditions. Previous pollen-based palaeoclimatic records from three well-dated Arctic lake sites highlight the response of regional Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Mountain Birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) forest-tundra transition to Holocene climatic variability and suggest the northernmost Peninsulas of Finnmark to be climatically sensitive. This study analysed dated sediment sequences between c. 3970 and c. 6200cal. yr BP from these three previously published shallow lakes: Liten ap'pesjav'ri (LCJ), over Gunnarsfjorden (OGF) and over Kobbkrokvatnet (OKV), for freshwater diatoms. Diatom assemblages showed an increase in the planktonic diatoms relative to benthic diatoms, with an onset towards higher abundances of small centric planktonic diatoms at OGF (between c. 5270 and 5350cal. yr BP) and OKV (between c. 5280 and 5350cal. yr BP). Additionally, a diatom compositional shift was detected at LCJ between c. 5180 and 5300cal. yr BP. Trend analysis found the main diatom compositional change at all three sites to occur at 5300cal. yr BP. However, this synchronous diatom shift during the mid-Holocene varies in magnitude within the three Finnmark lakes. The abrupt planktonic:benthic diatom ratio changes are independent of the Pinus:Betula ratios and are likely to be a result of lake ice-cover changes, allowing longer growing seasons, greater water column stability and higher nutrient concentrations from surrounding catchments.

During the 3 month reproduction season, the delta N-15 values of spawned eggs decreased with time. This result implies that there was a shift from lake-produced eggs to river-produced eggs within a reproductive season, based on the observation that adult fish in the lake had previously been shown to have eggs with distinctly higher delta N-15 values in their ovaries than those in the tributaries. This explanation was also supported by the change in delta C-13 values of the spawned eggs. Furthermore, eggs with lower delta N-15 and higher delta C-13 values tended to be spawned at less variable depths, suggesting that females spawning river-produced eggs selected the spawning sites from a narrower range. We conclude that stable isotope ratios of spawned eggs can be indicators of the relative contributions of different food chains and can enable comparisons of reproductive characteristics between types of egg.

Most of the morphological features of this new variety are identical to those of the nominal variety Gyrosigma peisonis var. peisonis, but the variety major differs in its distinctly larger cell size and its higher value for the longitudinal/transverse stria density ratio, however. The seasonal variation of this taxon, which was investigated by a sediment-trap study is also discussed.

Genotype by environment interactions of heat stress disorder resistance in crisphead lettuce	PLANT BREEDING												Lettuce is a cool season crop susceptible to physiological disorders when exposed to supra optimal temperatures. Genotype (G) by environment (E) interaction (GE) of rib discolouration, tipburn, premature bolting and ribbiness in crisphead lettuce was characterized under high temperature and long day growing conditions. Replicated data of 10 crisphead lettuce varieties from two plantings in each of four growing seasons at two locations in Quebec were analysed using the GGE biplot method. Head-weight-over-stem-length ratio, ribbiness, rib discolouration incidence and tipburn incidence were affected (P = 0.00001) by E, G and GE. E explained more variation in head-weight-over-stem-length ratio (77.1%) and rib discolouration incidence (77.3%) than G and GE, whereas GE explained more variation (72.4%) in tipburn incidence and G explained more variation (38%) in ribbiness. Strong crossover GE was detected with rib discolouration and tipburn incidence, but not with head-weight-over-stem-length ratio and ribbiness. Under heat stress, varieties of the Vanguard group had lower ribbiness than those of the Great Lakes group. Cultivar 'Estival' showed consistent resistance to bolting, ribbiness, tipburn and rib discolouration across all E.					; Yan, Weikai/JXW-6700-2024	Yan, Weikai/0000-0003-2399-1452; 													0179-9541	1439-0523				AUG	2009	128	4					374	380		10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01657.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2009.01657.x													WOS:000268659400008

The lake is hydrologically closed and the water balance is controlled mostly by groundwater input and evaporation. Three main modern depositional sub-environments can be recognized as: (i) a carbonate-producing 'littoral platform'; (ii) a steep 'talus' dominated by reworking of littoral sediments and mass-wasting processes; and (iii) an 'offshore, distal area', seasonally affected by anoxia with fine-grained, clastic sediment deposition. A seismic survey identified up to 15 m thick sedimentary infill comprising: (i) a 'basal unit', seismically transparent and restricted to the depocentres of both sub-basins; (ii) an 'intermediate unit' characterized by continuous high-amplitude reflections; and (iii) an 'upper unit' with strong parallel reflectors. Several mass-wasting deposits occur in both sub-basins. Five sediment cores were analysed using sedimentological, microscopic, geochemical and physical techniques. The chronological model for the sediment sequence is based on 17 accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dates. Five depositional environments were characterized by their respective sedimentary facies associations. The depositional history of Lake Estanya during the last ca 21 kyr comprises five stages: (i) a brackish, shallow, calcite-producing lake during full glacial times (21 to 17 center dot 3 kyr bp); (ii) a saline, permanent, relatively deep lake during the late glacial (17 center dot 3 to 11 center dot 6 kyr bp); (iii) an ephemeral, saline lake and saline mudflat complex during the transition to the Holocene (11 center dot 6 to 9 center dot 4 kyr bp); (iv) a saline lake with gypsum-rich, laminated facies and abundant microbial mats punctuated by periods of more frequent flooding episodes and clastic-dominated deposition during the Holocene (9 center dot 4 to 0 center dot 8 kyr bp); and (v) a deep, freshwater to brackish lake with high clastic input during the last 800 years. Climate-driven hydrological fluctuations are the main internal control in the evolution of the lake during the last 21 kyr, affecting water salinity, lake-level changes and water stratification. However, external factors, such as karstic processes, clastic input and the occurrence of mass-flows, are also significant. The facies model defined for Lake Estanya is an essential tool for deciphering the main factors influencing lake deposition and to evaluate the most suitable proxies for lake level, climate and environmental reconstructions, and it is applicable to modern karstic lakes and to ancient lacustrine formations.

Interactions between sediment processes and ecosystem responses in the Green Bay of Lake Michigan	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Estuaries, in particular freshwater estuaries, provide valuable economic, social, and ecological services, but their ecosystems are often heavily stressed. Located in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, Green Bay is a large freshwater estuary and a prominent example of a degraded ecosystem due to intensive human interventions and rapid development. Excessive amounts of contaminants and nutrients were discharged to the bay by inflowing tributaries for almost half a century, while in contrast Green Bay's seasonal-, morphological-, and physically-restricted mixing is unable to export a significant portion of those materials out of the bay, that is, Green Bay behaves as an efficient retention basin for the Lake Michigan. Consequently, several environmental and public health-related issues have risen in Green Bay and turned the lower bay into an area of environmental concern since the 1980s. To address these challenges, restoration programs were developed, including the development of monitoring programs, scientific research, and remedial action plans. There is a consensus that accelerated loading rates of contaminated and nutrient-rich sediments are a major driver of the environmental crisis in the bay, yet the fate and transport patterns of Green Bay sediments are not clearly understood. While field observations in Green Bay are season-limited and costly, advanced computing techniques provided opportunities to refine our understanding of sediment dynamics in this estuarine system. This review of existing knowledge on Green Bay sediment processes can help to better understand the interplay between sediments, and physical/biogeochemical activities in estuarine systems and contributes conceptually to the restoration of degraded aquatic ecosystems.This article is categorized under:Science of Water > Hydrological ProcessesScience of Water > Water QualityWater and Life > Stresses and Pressures on Ecosystems					Hamidi, Sajad/KPA-4997-2024	Hamidi, Sajad Ahmad/0000-0003-4761-5750; /0000-0002-1222-9975													2049-1948					SEP	2023	10	5								10.1002/wat2.1668	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wat2.1668		JUN 2023											WOS:001000058800001

These products convert rapidly to inorganic forms of arsenic (As) in soils and are mobilized readily. Leachates have been known to contaminate groundwater and surface waters, although past studies have not examined whether use of these products has led to significant As accumulation in lake sediments. We used paleolimnological methods to document the depositional history and inventories of total As in sediments and porewaters of Little Lake Jackson in Florida, which is adjacent to three golf courses. Six sediment cores, four of which were Pb-210 dated, showed porewater total As concentrations as high as 435 mu g l(-1), and dry-sediment total As concentrations as high as 148 mg kg(-1). Approximately 537 kg of total As is present in > 19,000 metric tons of sediment (dry mass), and an additional 18 kg of As is dissolved in 10.8 x 10(4) m(3) of porewaters. Total As content in surface sediments (mean = 47.3 mg kg(-1)) exceeds the consensus-based sedimentary concentration for probable toxicity effects in freshwater benthic fauna. Surface and subsurface waters flow to the lake from topographically higher areas to the west, where golf courses and residential areas are located. Total As concentrations were elevated highly in monitoring wells and in a stream that flows between the golf courses and lake, but As was below detection limits in wells that were located at the distal perimeter of the golf courses. Subsurface and surface waters exit the lake towards topographically lower areas to the east. Nearly all As in sediments remains bound in the solid phase, indicating that As sedimentary profiles largely reflect depositional history. Sedimentary As concentrations are correlated strongly with aluminum and iron, which suggests that As was scavenged from lake waters during the past. Sedimentary As concentrations increased until the 1980s, then declined somewhat to the present time. Dissolved As was scavenged efficiently from the water column when hypolimnetic waters were oxygenated persistently, but after eutrophication led to a seasonally anoxic hypolimnion in the 1980s, apparently less As was co-precipitated, and more was lost to hydrological outflow. Arsenic accumulation in sediments might be common in areas where As derived from organic arsenical herbicide applications is directed by shallow water tables towards adjacent lakes.

Then, comprehensive pollution index method, comprehensive nutrition state index method and health risk assessment model were utilized to evaluate the quality, nutrition, and health risk of Dongping Lake water. Results showed that the quality of Dongping Lake water still met level III (light pollution) no matter before or after water delivery. The nutrition state was improved from light eutropher before water delivery to mesotropher after water delivery. The health risk level was reduced from high-medium before water delivery to medium level after water delivery. In summary, the operation of the eastern route of South-North Water Transfer Project is beneficial for water environment improvement of Dongping Lake.																			2305-7068					DEC	2019	7	4					333	339		10.19637/j.cnki.2305-7068.2019.04.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.19637/j.cnki.2305-7068.2019.04.004													WOS:000501995800004

Recent groundwater and lake-stage trends in Cape Cod National Seashore: relationships with sea level rise, precipitation, and air temperature	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												Hydrological features on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, include groundwater, freshwater lakes, permanent and seasonal ponds, streams, and estuaries. Rainfall and evaporation/evapotranspiration have long been considered the dominant factors influencing both lake and groundwater levels in this sole-source, unconfined aquifer. However, increases in sea level may also have an effect, especially on this narrow peninsula with a sandy substrate of high permeability. In this study, we analyzed trends between 2000 and 2017 in eleven groundwater wells and nine kettle ponds situated with Cape Cod National Seashore (CCNS). We further explored relationships of these hydrologic variables with local precipitation, temperature and sea level during this period. The results suggest that while precipitation patterns influence seasonal and inter-annual variability, it appears that sea level rise (SLR) may be partially responsible for driving the longer-term trend of rising groundwater levels in several wells. Pond stages did not exhibit any statistically significant trends, and responded more to precipitation during this period of time. Notwithstanding, further acceleration of SLR, along with potential changes in precipitation patterns, can alter the freshwater hydrology of CCNS that may subsequently have biological, chemical, and physical effects throughout these systems.																			2040-2244					DEC	2019	10	4					953	967		10.2166/wcc.2018.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2018.016													WOS:000502089700016

Circulation patterns in a shallow tropical reservoir: Observations and modeling	JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The diurnal circulation pattern is deduced in Kranji Reservoir, a shallow, elongated tropical reservoir in Singapore via field observations and results from the 3-D Estuary, Lake, and Coastal Ocean Model (ELCOM) model for the month of July 2012 which is during Singapore's Southwest Monsoon season. Detailed comparisons of the modeled temperature and velocity fields with field measurements during a dry period of July 21-26 2012 without rainfall or inflow events are presented in terms of point comparisons, longitudinal profiles and cross-reservoir transverse velocity profile, thus providing a good representation of the flow field. Both observation and modeling show that the diurnal circulation pattern is driven by wind and by temperature gradients due to upwelling which depend on the time of the day. There is a daytime circulation pattern characterized by one large loop along the main channel, and a nighttime circulation characterized by two loops: one large loop between the reservoir dam and a location K1 (2500 m upstream from the dam where inflow tributary flows merge), and one small loop between K1 and the tributaries. These circulation patterns are consistent with the observed horizontal distribution of chlorophyll a during the Southwest Monsoon months over years 2008-2012. High chlorophyll a concentration occurs near the dam as expected due to downwelling within the large circulation loop and also close to the tributaries due to the nutrient from the catchments being trapped within the smaller loop. These results demonstrate the contributing effect of hydrodynamic flow on the biomass distribution that can occur in shallow tropical systems and which affects the diurnal and seasonal variation of biomass for such systems.					; Lo, Edmond/A-3747-2011	Fong, Derek/0000-0002-3828-7989; Lo, Edmond/0000-0003-4055-8386; Monismith, Stephen/0000-0002-7388-3313													1570-6443	1876-4444				DEC	2019	27						75	86		10.1016/j.jher.2019.09.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2019.09.002													WOS:000500382200006

Assessing the zooplankton community and environmental factors in a Mediterranean wetland	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Mediterranean wetlands represent unique repositories of biodiversity, but these ecosystems are increasingly threatened by human-induced habitat loss. Seventy percent of Greek wetlands (ponds, mires, marshes, etc.) have been lost in the past 80 years due to human intervention. In Greece habitat types of mires, listed in Directive 92/43/EEC, have been recorded in a few locations, one of the most important is Kalodiki wetland. Eutrophication key elements were determined at four sampling stations throughout 1 year in order to monitor the trophic conditions. Moreover, the zooplankton community was described as biological element relevant in the assessment of the ecological status of Kalodiki wetland. Kalodiki wetland exhibits nutrient concentrations corresponding to eutrophic conditions while according to chlorophyll-a values it is classified between mesotrophic and eutrophic status depending mostly on the sampling period. As concerning zooplankton community, it appears poor in species and dominated by small-sized organisms, which is generally typical of eutrophic, disturbed systems. Differences among zooplankton assemblages over seasons as well as among sampling sites highlight the role of both abiotic and biotic factors.

Land-use types and diversity may exert a negative or positive impact on FBS' water quality depending on their nature and arrangement. The information available in this respect is remarkably scarcer for water bodies in the Global South than for the north. Thus, we aim to identify and quantify the land-use types in a 500-m buffer zone of urban ponds in the Pampean region (Argentina) to assess their impact on water quality. We based our study on 15 FBS located in neighborhoods of Buenos Aires province during cold and warm seasons. We analyzed physical, chemical, and biological variables, and estimated water conditions by means of water quality indexes (WQIs) and quality guidelines. We quantified the dominant land-use type and the diversity of uses in the ponds' buffer zones, and evaluated their relationships with WQIs. Our results showed that WQIs were negatively related to a high proportion of residential areas in the adjacent zone, while positively to recreational ones. The diversity of land uses did not influence the water quality. We propose a new WQI(pond) with fewer key response variables, and as sensitive as the currently used WQI(objetive). We conclude that water quality from urban ponds in the Pampean region can be affected by dominant land-use type in the adjacent area but also the quality of their water supply sources (superficial and/or underground), clandestine wastewater discharges, and non-point pollution.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2023	195	6							648	10.1007/s10661-023-11216-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11216-7								37160623					WOS:000984905800005

This study developed and assessed a new vegetation index (VI) using Cyan, Orange, and Near Infrared (NIR) bands to assess Soybean growth dynamics. The study was conducted at Lakehead University Agriculture Research Station, Thunder Bay, Canada, over four reproductive stages of Soybean growth (R4-R7). Spectral profiles were created for each stage, and the correlation between each spectral band at different stages was tested. There was no linear correlation between different bands except the correlation between the Cyan and Orange bands at R5 and R6 stages. Existing VIs have also been explored using approximately similar band combinations. Based on this analysis, three VIs were proposed for this new camera, and their behavior at different stages was evaluated using Leaf Area Index (LAI). Cyan and Orange spectral values were relatively high in the first and last growing seasons, while NIR values increased dramatically in the mid-growing seasons and decreased in the last stage. VINIR,O,C index showed the best results for mid-growing seasons (correlation with LAI = 0.39 for R5 and R6). VIC,(O) index showed a high level of details visually (leaves and background) for R4 and R7 than the other indices and correlated highly with LAI (0.48 and -0.5, respectively). Overall, the study provided new VIs that can be used to effectively analyze Soybean growth dynamics, with different VIs showing reliability over different growing stages.

Previous studies, such as those that have conducted suitability index and canonical correspondence analyses (CCAs), have widely used a macro-invertebrate suitability analysis; however, these studies can only confirm a few coupling relationships between the environment and macro-invertebrates. In our study, one-way ANOVA, HCA, PCA and GAM models were used to explain the differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of environmental factors, as well as to reduce data redundancy. A response curve of the critical environmental factors and macro-invertebrates was constructed, and the nonlinear relationship between these factors and benthic animals was quantified to analyze the ecological threshold of the macro-invertebrates. The study area was the Majiagou River, Harbin, China. The results show that COD had significant seasonal differences due to complex hydrological conditions, and most of the water quality factors had spatial differences. The GAM model explained 60% of the Margalef diversity index (MDI) variance. The relationship between chlorophyll-a and MDI was unimodal, and MDI and NH4+-N essentially showed a negative correlation; when the total nitrogen (TN) value reached 5.8 mg/L, MDI reached its peak. When MDI was higher than the mean value, the chlorophyll-a range was 18.1 mu g/L similar to 83 mu g/L. The NH4+-N was less than 1.8 mg/L, and TN was 1.8 similar to 6.8 mg/L. This study provides a reference for the comprehensive management of urban river ecosystems.

Analysis of bias in accumulated precipitation amount and precipitation occurrence statistics suggests that IMERG presents various uncertainties with respect to time scale, meteorological season, PMW source, QI, and land surface type. Results indicate that 1) the cold season's (November-April) larger relative bias can be mitigated via backward morphing; 2) IMERG 6-h precipitation amount scored best in the warmest season (JJA) with a consistent overestimation of the frequency bias index 2 1 (FBI-1); 3) the performance of five PMW sources is affected by the season to different degrees; 4) in terms of some metrics, skills do not always enhance with increasing QI; 5) local lake effects lead to higher correlation and equitable threat score (ETS) for the stations closest to the lakes. Results of this study will be beneficial to both developers and users of IMERG precipi-tation products. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of the study was to assess the performance of the gridded precipita-tion product from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) version 6 over the Great Lakes region of North America. The assessment performs a statistical comparison of precipitation amounts from IMERG versus surface stations as a function of time scale, season, precipitation event threshold, and in-put source among satellites. Interpretation of the results identifies shortcomings in the IMERG algorithms, particularly in extreme precipitation events and over ice-covered surfaces. The results also describe spatial variability in the IMERG data quality due to the complex geography of the study area and offer a clear threshold in the Quality Index (QI) flag for optimal application of the precipitation products.					; Zhao, Bo/JJD-9615-2023	Zhao, Bo/0000-0003-0885-9760; 													1525-755X	1525-7541				JUN	2023	24	6					1017	1037		10.1175/JHM-D-22-0214.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-22-0214.1													WOS:001012848800003

G.; Martins, Eduardo G.; Patterson, David A.; Cooke, Steven J.; Power, Michael			Partial diel migration: A facultative migration underpinned by long-term inter-individual variation	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. The variations in migration that comprise partial diel migrations, putatively occur entirely as a consequence of behavioural flexibility. However, seasonal partial migrations are increasingly recognised to be mediated by a combination of reversible plasticity in response to environmental variation and individual variation due to genetic and environmental effects. 2. Here, we test the hypothesis that while partial diel migration heterogeneity occurs primarily due to short-term within-individual flexibility in behaviour, long-term individual differences in migratory behaviour also underpin this migration variation. 3. Specifically, we use a hierarchical behavioural reaction norm approach to partition within- and among-individual variation in depth use and diel plasticity in depth use, across short- and long-term time-scales, in a group of 47 burbot (Lota lota) tagged with depth-sensing acoustic telemetry transmitters. 4. We found that within- individual variation at the among-dates-within-seasons and among-seasons scale, explained the dominant proportion of phenotypic variation. However, individuals also repeatedly differed in their expression of migration behaviour over the 2 year study duration. 5. These results reveal that diel migration variation occurs primarily due to short- term within-individual flexibility in depth use and diel migration behaviour. However, repeatable individual differences also played a key role in mediating partial diel migration. 6. These findings represent a significant advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms generating the important, yet poorly understood phenomena of partial diel migration. Moreover, given the pervasive occurrence of diel migrations across aquatic taxa, these findings indicate that individual differences have an important, yet previously unacknowledged role in structuring the temporal and vertical dynamics of aquatic ecosystems.

An assessment of water quality parameters and survival of indicator in pilgrimage place of Velankanni, Tamil Nadu, India	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Velankanni is anthropogenically highly vulnerable due to unregulated religious activities and intensive tourist density. The present study focuses on the impact of holy water bathing on water quality parameters and microbiological indicators. Water samples were collected at three different stations in a monthly interval starting before the onset of festival, during the festival and after festival season from August to October, 2013. The following indicators were analyzed: surface seawater temperature (30 -33 degrees C), hydrogen ion concentration (7.4-8.3), electrical conductivity (6.9-11.4 mS/cm), salinity (16.2 -37.0 ppt), total suspended solids (1080-2920 mg/l), total dissolved solids (20450-51880 mg/l), total solids (22650-53120 mg/l), dissolved oxygen (3.4-5.7 mg/l) and microbiological indicators (total heterotrophic bacteria (1-61 x 10(-3) cfu/ml), total coliform bacteria (1-57 x 10(-2) cfu/ml) and total Enterococcus bacteria (1-41 x 10(-2) cfu/ml). Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between season and water quality (p < 0.05). This study strongly supports the necessity to implement water quality monitoring, coastal management policy and regulation of ritual activities, including the prevention of the waterborne diseases. Implementing these ideas would increase coastal water quality and maintenance of the beauty of the beach, which in turn promotes pilgrimage and tourism activities thereby benefiting the local communities and improving the regional economy.

Priority effects among young-of-the-year fish: reduced growth of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) caused by yellow perch (Perca flavescens)?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. When available, Daphnia spp. are often preferred by age-0 yellow perch and bluegill sunfish because of energetic profitability. We hypothesised that predation by age-0 yellow perch could lead to a midsummer decline (MSD) of Daphnia spp. and that priority effects may favour yellow perch because they hatch before bluegill, allowing them to capitalise on Daphnia spp. prior to bluegill emergence. 2. Data were collected from 2004 to 2010 in Pelican Lake, Nebraska, U. S. A. The lake experienced a prolonged MSD in all but 1 year (2005), generally occurring within the first 2 weeks of June except in 2008 and 2010 when it occurred at the end of June. MSD timing is not solely related to seasonal patterns of age-0 yellow perch consumption. Nevertheless, when Daphnia spp. biomass was low during 2004 and 2006-2010 (<4 mg wet weight L-1), predation by age-0 yellow perch seems to have suppressed Daphnia spp. biomass (i.e. <1.0 mg wet weight L-1). The exception was 2005 when age-0 yellow perch were absent. 3. Growth of age-0 bluegill was significantly faster in 2005, when Daphnia spp. were available in greater densities (>4 mg wet weight L-1) compared with the other years (<0.2 mg wet weight L-1). 4. We conclude that age-0 yellow perch are capable of reducing Daphnia biomass prior to the arrival of age-0 bluegill, ultimately slowing bluegill growth. Thus, priority effects favour age-0 yellow perch when competing with age-0 bluegill for Daphnia. However, these effects may be minimised if there is a shorter time between hatching of the two species, higher Daphnia spp. densities or lower age-0 yellow perch densities.

From historical records and surveys conducted in the dry season of 2005 and wet season of 2007, we report (1) recent changes in the terminal positions of large valley glaciers (Speke, Elena) and (2) spot measurements of alpine riverflow along altitudinal transects of the principal river (River Mubuku) draining alpine icefields in order to assess the relative contribution of icefields and underlying ecotones to river discharge. Observed acceleration in the rates of termini retreat of the Speke and Elena glaciers since the late 1960s is attributed, in part, to the convex-concave slope profile in which these valley glaciers reside. We show that current glacial recession has a negligible impact on alpine riverflow. Spot measurements of meltwater discharges indicate that icefields contribute considerably less than 2% of the river discharge at the base of the Rwenzori Mountains during both dry and wet seasons. An anomalously high specific discharge of the River Mubuku (1730 mm a(-1)) arises from high rates of precipitation exceeding 2000 mm a(-1) below alpine icefields within Heath-moss and Montane forest ecotones that occupy more than half of the river's gauged catchment area. For other tropical alpine icefields representing a tiny fraction (<1%) of alpine river catchment areas (e.g. Irian Jaya, Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya), glacial meltwater discharges are similarly expected to contribute a negligible proportion of alpine riverflow.

Moisture and lake-level proxies, pollen assemblages and magnetic susceptibility, indicate that rainfall in the Masoko area was strongly controlled by low-latitude insolation (i.e., precessional forcing). Such observations contrast with the climatic patterns previously reconstructed in East Africa for the last glacial. Indeed, widespread dry conditions are generally observed and are attributed to the predominant control of high latitude glacial forcing over insolation forcing on the tropical hydrology. However, during the Younger Dryas cold event, out of phase with regional insolation behaviour, wetter conditions prevailed in this area, suggesting that the rainfall belt over Africa was probably shifted to the South, bringing moisture to the southernmost tropics.					; Garcin, Yannick/IUQ-1103-2023; Guiot, Joel/G-7818-2011	Guiot, Joel/0000-0001-7345-4466; Garcin, Yannick/0000-0001-8205-494X; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				APR 4	2006	33	7							L07703	10.1029/2005GL025531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005GL025531													WOS:000236878100005
J	Rocchini, D; Butini, SA; Chiarucci, A				Rocchini, D; Butini, SA; Chiarucci, A			Maximizing plant species inventory efficiency by means of remotely sensed spectral distances	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Inventorying plant species in an area based on randomly placed quadrats can be quite inefficient. The aim of this paper is to test whether plant species richness can be inventoried more efficiently by means of a spectrally-based ordering of sites to be sampled. Location The study area was a complex wetland ecosystem, the Lake Montepulciano Nature Reserve, central Italy. This is one of the most important wetland areas of central Italy because of the diverse plant communities and the seasonal avifauna. Methods Field sampling, based on a random stratified sampling design, was performed in June 2002. Plant species composition was recorded within sampling units of 100 m(2) (plots) and 1 ha (macroplots). A QuickBird multispectral image of the same date was acquired and corrected both geometrically and radiometrically. Species accumulation curves based on spectral information were obtained by ordering sites to be sampled according to a maximum spectral distance criterion (i.e. by ordering sampling units based on the maximum distances among them in a four-dimensional spectral space derived from the remotely sensed data). Different distance measures based on mean and maximum spectral distances among sampling units were tested. The performance of the species accumulation curve derived by the spectrally-based ordering of sampling units was tested against a rarefaction curve obtained from the mean of 10,000 accumulation curves based on randomly ordered sampling units. Results The spectrally-derived curve based on the maximum spectral distance among sampling units showed the most rapid accumulation of species, well above the rarefaction curve, at both the plot and the macroplot scales. Other ordering criteria of sampling units captured less richness over most of the species accumulation curves at both the spatial scales. The accumulation curves based on other measurements of distance were much closer to the random curve and did not show differences with respect to the species rarefaction curve based on random ordering of sampling units. Main conclusions The present investigation demonstrated that spectral-based ordering of sites to be sampled can lead to the maximization of the efficiency of plant species inventories, an activity usually driven by the 'botanist's internal algorithm' (intuition), without any formalized rule to drive field sampling. The proposed approach can reduce costs of plant species inventorying through a more efficient allotment of time and sampling.

Phytoplankton community and physical-chemical characteristics of water in the public reservoir of Cruzeta, RN, Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The Phytoplankton community and the abiotic factors of the Cruzeta reservoir were studied at three depths, surface, middle (2 m) and bottom, from September, 2004 to June, 2005, in order to characterize the environment and assess the possible factors that influence the compositional change of phytoplankton. Ninety species belonging to 6 classes (Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Dinophyceae, Chrysophyceae and Euglenophyceae) were identified with 66 and 80 taxonomic units in the dry and rainy season. The most representative class in terms of species richness was Chlorophyceae and dominated by Scendesmus quadricauda, Oocystis sp. and Chlorella sp. The group cyanobacteria were represented by 18 species of diverse morphological characteristics and the dominance of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in September 2004. The other major group, Bacillariophyceae is represented by 21 species with the predominance of Aulacoseira granulata in mid-column and bottom waters. The other dominant species was Phacus acuminatus of Euglenophyceae. The species diversity and evenness indices were high, moderate and low in relation to the three hydroperiod registered during the 2004-2005 annual cycle. The reservoir exhibits high electrical conductivity (290-550 mu S.cm(-1)) alkaline pH (7.3-9.4), mean temperature of 28 degrees C, varying concentrations of dissolved oxygen (3.29-7.6 mg.L-1) and the greatest concentration of nutrients at the bottom (orthophosphate, 0.22-0.62 mg.L-1) with the general tendency of oligo-mesotrophic status during sampling periods. The chlorophyll a fluctuated to a minimum of 1.34 mu g.L-1 at the bottom in April, 2005 and a maximum of 14.3 mu g.L-1 in mid-column water in September, 2004. The reservoir is characteristically an oligo-mesotrophic environment.					; Rocha, Odete/D-3473-2012	Chellappa, Naithirithi/0000-0003-3463-029X; 													1519-6984					AUG	2008	68	3					477	494		10.1590/S1519-69842008000300004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842008000300004								18833468					WOS:000259551900003

Iodide, a necessary element for thyroid hormone production, varies in diet, and is more abundant in estuarine environments, which could alter thyroid hormone variation. However, associations between thyroid hormone concentrations in animals from marine versus freshwater environments, which could become more pertinent with rising sea levels associated with global climate change, are not well studied. To determine the importance of dietary iodide in seasonal variation of plasma thyroid hormone concentrations, we analyzed seasonal variation of plasma thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(3)) concentrations in juvenile alligators from an estuarine habitat (Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge; MI) and a freshwater habitat (Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge; LW) and compared these results to plasma inorganic iodide (PII) concentrations. Alligators from MI did not display seasonal variation in plasma T(4), but exhibited a seasonal pattern in plasma T(3) concentrations similar to alligators from LW. Plasma thyroid hormone concentrations were consistently higher at MI than at LW. PII concentrations were correlated with plasma T(4) and T(3) concentrations in juvenile alligators from LW but not MI. The data on plasma T(4) and T(3) concentrations suggest altered iodide metabolism in estuarine alligators. Differences in thyroid hormone concentrations between the populations could be due to differences in dietary iodide, which need to be further evaluated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Shamir, E; Georgakakos, KP				Shamir, E; Georgakakos, KP			Distributed snow accumulation and ablation modeling in the American River basin	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												A spatially distributed snow model procedure for estimating snow melt, snow water equivalent and snow cover area is formulated and tested with data from the American River basin in California's Sierra Nevada. An adaptation of the operational National Weather Service snow accumulation and ablation model is used for each model grid cell forced by spatially distributed precipitation and temperature data. The model was implemented with 6-hourly time steps on I km 2 grid cells for the snow season of 1999-2003. Temperature is spatially interpolated using the prevailing lapse rate and digital terrain elevation data. Precipitation is spatially interpolated using regional climatological analyses obtained from PRISM. Parameters that control snow melt are distributed using ground surface aspect. The model simulations are compared with data from 12 snow-sensors located in the basin and the daily 500-m snow cover extent product from the MODIS/Terra satellite mission. The results show that the distribution of snow pack over the area is generally captured. The snow pack quantity compared to snow gauges is well estimated in high elevations with increasing uncertainty in the snow pack at lower elevations. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses indicate that the significant input uncertainty for precipitation and temperature is primarily responsible for model errors in lower elevations and near the snow line. The model is suitable for producing spatially resolved realistic snow pack simulations when forced with operationally available observed or predicted data.

In contrast to the costs borne by those in the vicinity of the river, Ghana has enjoyed vast economic benefits from the affordable hydropower, irrigation schemes and lake tourism that developed after construction of the dams. Herein lies the challenge; there exists a trade-off between water for river ecosystems and related services on the one hand and anthropogenic water demands such as hydropower or irrigation on the other. In this study, an Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search (EMODPS) is used to explore the multi-sectoral trade-offs that exist in the Lower Volta River basin. Three environmental flows, previously determined for the Lower Volta, are incorporated separately as environmental objectives. The results highlight the dominance of hydropower production in the Lower Volta but show that there is room for providing environmental flows under current climatic and water use conditions if the firm energy requirement from Akosombo Dam reduces by 12 % to 38 % depending on the environmental flow regime that is implemented. There is uncertainty in climate change effects on runoff in this region; however multiple scenarios are investigated. It is found that climate change leading to increased annual inflows to the Akosombo Dam reduces the trade-off between hydropower and the environment as this scenario makes more water available for users. Furthermore, climate change resulting in decreased annual inflows provides the opportunity to strategically provide dry-season environmental flows, that is, reduce flows sufficiently to meet low flow requirements for key ecosystem services such as the clam fishery. This study not only highlights the challenges in balancing anthropogenic water demands and environmental considerations in managing existing dams but also identifies opportunities for compromise in the Lower Volta River.

Their choice will depend on minimising the error. In this work, two deterministic (Inverse Distance Weight , Local Polynomial Interpolation) and two stochastic methods (Simple and Ordinary Kriging) were applied to predict seasonal and annual atmospheric methane (CH4) concentration means. Two sampling networks were designed in an intermediate city, covering a wide variety of urban densities, with different sampling site numbers. The main objective was to find the interpolation model that best predicts CH4 concentration and to analyse if the network's expansion improves the metric errors -the mean error (ME) and the root-mean -square error (RMSE). The ME values were close to zero in all cases , the stochastic methods had the smallest RMSE for both networks. Besides, adding more sampling sites improved up to 50% of the RMSE values. Finally, an integrated map was obtained incorporating all the best interpolation models, which gave a difference of <4% between the measured and the estimated CH4 concentration. This type of study is helpful to evaluate the design of a sampling network, the territorial planning and future installations of CH4 sources.

A mixture distribution of the bulk (Student-t) and tail (GPD-negative binomial) components of storm surge is estimated in a hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework. Parameters are modeled across the entire shoreline using Gaussian processes and hourly gauged data, with priors for spatial autocorrelation informed by numerical output from a lake hydrodynamic model. The distribution of total water levels is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling that combines the estimated distribution of surge with stochastic traces of static lake levels that account for water level management, seasonality, and plausible variability in water supplies. The approach can therefore support coastal flood risk assessments in cases when the distribution of static water levels changes are due to altered water level management or climate change. The model is applied in a case study on Lake Ontario. Results suggest that spatial variability in parameter estimates varies significantly by month and mixture distribution component. Evaluations of performance indicate the model is able to capture adequately storm surge behavior at gauges across the lakeshore, even under crossvalidation. A frequency analysis of total water levels at two ungauged sites is presented, with specific attention given to the implications of model assumptions on uncertainty in design events. The paper concludes with a discussion of model limitations and avenues for future work. (c) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, we identified the average precipitation retention time-due to subsurface flows-from the delay time calculated using the response function with data of water level and catchment precipitation (both rainfall and snowfall) collected over 30 years of continuous observations of Lake Biwa, Japan. We focused on the snow reserves and the water-level response delay due to the snowmelt of Lake Biwa catchment. We concluded that the average precipitation retention time of the catchment subsurface flow (i.e., above the impermeable layer) in Lake Biwa was approximately 45 days. Additionally, the precipitation retention time during snowmelt was shorter than that during the dry season. Overall, the shape of the response function reflects the lake system. This knowledge improves the understanding of lake systems and can be helpful for lake resource managers. Furthermore, finding the delay time from the response function may be useful for determining the contribution of rainfall to increasing the water levels of other lakes. Therefore, our results can contribute to the development of management strategies to address inland aquatic ecosystems and conservation.

To increase the prediction accuracy, a coupling model (DWT-iNARX) is established by combining the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) with improved nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs network (iNARX), for predicting the daily Taihu water level during the flood season under different forecast periods. And the DWT-iNARX model is compared with the back-propagation neural network (BP) and iNARX models to assess its capability in prediction. Meanwhile, we propose an uncertainty analysis method based on Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) for quantifying model uncertainty and performing probabilistic water level forecast. The results show that three models achieve good simulation results with higher accuracy when the forecast period is short, such as 1-3 days. In overall performance, iNARX and DWT-iNARX models show superiority in comparison with the BP model, while the DWT-iNARX model yields the best performance among all the other models. The research results can provide a certain reference for the water level forecast of the Taihu Lake.

The research in question was conducted in the period of 2009-2011, the samples of sediment and overlying water were collected at two stations located in the upper and lower parts of each reservoir. The concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in pore water and overlying water were measured with the headspace method, using a Pye Unicam gas chromatograph (PU-4410/19) equipped with a methane analyzer allowing low CO2 concentrations to be detected. Diffusive fluxes of the analyzed gases at the sediment-overlying water interface were calculated on the basis of Fick's first law, and were found to range from -0.01 to 3.48 mmolxm(-2)xd(-1) for CH4 and from -1.27 to 47.02 mmolxm(-2)xd(-1) for CO2. Comparable fluxes elsewhere typify the reservoirs experiencing far-reaching eutrophication. No dependent relationships were found between the values calculated for fluxes and either season of the year or sediment characteristics.

Mussels were collected out of the breeding season in Paimun Lake and acclimated in the laboratory. Two exposure experiments were performed during two consecutive weeks: (1) mussels challenged with 500 yeast cells mL(-1); and (2) mussels challenged with 1000 bacteria cells mL(-1). Microorganisms were added in the water every two days, alternating with 6000 lyophilized cells of the green algae Scenedesmus vacuolatus mL(-1). A control group, fed with S. vacuolatus, was set for each treatment. Morphological cell characterization was carried out in adherent hemocytes of D. chilensis hemolymph under control conditions. The most important cell type observed were the hyalinocytes (representing ca. 98% of the circulating cells), agranular cells with non-central polymorphic nucleus surrounded by cytoplasm; granulocytes (cells with cytoplasmic granules and non-central rounded nucleus) represented ca. 2%. Another two cell types were occasionally detected, binucleated hyalinocytes and hemoblast-like cells but were not considered for the analyses. Both adherent hyalinocytes and granulocytes exhibit phagocytic activity towards Congo red stained yeast, which was two-fold higher in granulocytes than in hyalinocytes, regardless of the applied challenge. Total hemocyte counts were diminished in mussels challenged with S. cerevisiae or E. coli. Hydrolytic and defense cellular enzyme activities were analyzed only for hyalinocytes. Both, S. cerevisiae and E. coli increased acid phosphatase activity. E. coli challenge diminished hemocyte lysosomal membrane stability and increased humoral phenoloxidase activity, while S. cerevisiae challenge did not affect any of these variables. Mussels challenged with E. coil showed increased gill antioxidant response without oxidative damage, while those challenged with S. cerevisiae showed no change in these variables.																			0022-2011	1096-0805				SEP	2018	157						36	44		10.1016/j.jip.2018.08.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2018.08.005								30099010					WOS:000444783000006

Seasonal air-water exchange fluxes of polychlorinated biphenyls in the Hudson River Estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in the air and water over the Hudson River Estuary during six intensive field campaigns from December 1999 to April 2001. Over-water gas-phase Sigma PCB concentrations averaged 1100 pg/m(3) and varied with temperature. Dissolved-phase Sigma PCB concentrations averaged 1100 pg/L and displayed no seasonal trend. Uncertainty analysis of the results suggests that PCBs with 5 or fewer chlorines exhibited net volatilization. The direction of net air/water exchange could not be determined for PCBs with 6 or more chlorines. Instantaneous net fluxes of Sigma PCBs ranged from +0.2 to +630 ng m(-2) d(-1). Annual fluxes of Sigma PCBs were predicted from modeled gas-phase concentrations, measured dissolved-phase concentrations, daily surface water temperatures and wind speeds. The net volatilization flux was +62 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), corresponding to an annual loss of +28 kg/yr of Sigma PCBs from the Hudson River Estuary for the year of 2000. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Pliocene hominins from East Turkana were associated with mesic environments in a semiarid basin	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												During the middle Pliocene (similar to 3.8-3.2 Ma), both Australopithecus afarensis and Kenyanthropus platyops are known from the Turkana Basin, but between 3.60 and 3.44 Ma, most hominin fossils are found on the west side of Lake Turkana. Here, we describe a new hominin locality (ET03-166/168, Area 129) from the east side of the lake, in the Lokochot Member of the Koobi Fora Formation (3.60-3.44 Ma). To reconstruct the paleoecology of the locality and its surroundings, we combine information from sedimentology, the relative abundance of associated mammalian fauna, phytoliths, and stable isotopes from plant wax biomarkers, pedogenic carbonates, and fossil tooth enamel. The combined evidence provides a detailed view of the local paleoenvironment occupied by these Pliocene hominins, where a biodiverse community of primates, including hominins, and other mammals inhabited humid, grassy woodlands in a fluvial floodplain setting. Between <3.596 and 3.44 Ma, increases in woody vegetation were, at times, associated with increases in arid-adapted grasses. This suggests that Pliocene vegetation included woody species that were resilient to periods of prolonged aridity, resembling vegetation structure in the Turkana Basin today, where arid-adapted woody plants are a significant component of the ecosystem. Pedogenic carbonates indicate more woody vegetation than other vegetation proxies, possibly due to differences in temporospatial scale and ecological biases in preservation that should be accounted for in future studies. These new hominin fossils and associated multiproxy paleoenvironmental indicators from a single locale through time suggest that early hominin species occupied a wide range of habitats, possibly including wetlands within semiarid landscapes. Local-scale paleoecological evidence from East Turkana supports regional evidence that middle Pliocene eastern Africa may have experienced large-scale, climate-driven periods of aridity. This information extends our understanding of hominin environments beyond the limits of simple wooded, grassy, or mosaic environmental descriptions. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Matthews, B; Mazumder, A				Matthews, Blake; Mazumder, Asit			Habitat specialization and the exploitation of allochthonous carbon by zooplankton	ECOLOGY												The significance of spatial subsidies depends on consumer resource interactions in the recipient habitat. Lakes are subsidized by terrestrial carbon sources, but the pathways of allochthonous carbon through lake food webs are complex and not well understood. Zooplankton vertically partition resources within stratified lakes in response to life history trade-offs that are governed by predators, the quantity and quality of food, and abiotic conditions (e.g., UV, temperature, and viscosity). We measured habitat specialization of zooplankton in an oligotrophic lake where allochthonous and autochthonous resources varied with depth. During strati. cation, the quantity and quality of zooplankton food was highest in the hypolimnion. We used a yearlong time series of the delta C-13 of zooplankton and particulate organic matter (POM) to determine which zooplankton species exploited hypolimnetic rather than epilimnetic resources. Because the delta C-13 of POM decreased with depth, we used the delta C-13 of zooplankton to detect inter- and intraspecific variation in habitat selection. We incubated Daphnia pulex at discrete depths in the water column to confirm that the delta C-13 of zooplankton can indicate habitat specialization. Zooplankton that specialized in the epilimnion relied more on allochthonous carbon sources than those that specialized in the hypolimnion. Therefore, the fate of allochthonous carbon subsidies to lakes depends on spatially explicit consumer resource interactions.

Comparison of seasonal dynamics of the essential PUFA contents in benthic invertebrates and grayling Thymallus arcticus in the Yenisei river	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Seasonal dynamics of contents of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in dominant groups of benthic invertebrates: gammarids (Gammaridae, Amphipoda), oligochaetes (Oligochaeta), chironomid larvae (Chironomidae, Diptera) and caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera), and dominant benthivorous fish, Siberian grayling Thymallus arcticus, have been studied in ecosystem of the large Siberian river. During the year of the study most benthic invertebrate taxa showed significant variations in the contents of both C-18 and long chain C-20-22 PUFAs. In contrast, the fish, which consumed the zoobenthos, had no significant seasonal variations in long chain PUFAs' contents. Thereby, the fish, as organisms of relatively higher evolution level than invertebrates, was supposed to have more strict metabolic control of long chain PUFAs' contents. Evidence was obtained that the studied fish species, grayling, may be capable to convert dietary EPA into DHA. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Variation in the Vocal Behavior of Common Loons (Gavia immer): Insights from Landscape-level Recordings	WATERBIRDS												Animal signals play an important role in mate attraction and territory defense, and animals may benefit by adopting signaling strategies that maximize effective communication in the face of changing environmental conditions. In this study, a custom-designed microphone array was used to collect landscape-scale recordings of the acoustic signaling behavior of Common Loons (Gavia immer) along a 10-km transect spanning three lakes in eastern Ontario, Canada. Recordings were collected during the early part of the breeding season during two consecutive years (2008-2009). Analyses focused on understanding how the vocal output of Common Loons varied with time of day, time of year, and in response to variation in weather. Common Loons showed significant diel variation in vocal output, producing more wail, yodel, and tremolo calls at night than during the day. Common Loons showed significant seasonal variation in vocal output, producing fewer wail, yodel, and tremolo calls as the first month of the breeding season progressed. Common Loons showed significant differences in vocal behavior with changing weather conditions, producing more calls at cold temperatures, with low wind speed and air pressure, and when rain was light or absent. Microphone array recordings were used to estimate signal transmission properties of Common Loon vocalizations, demonstrating that wail, yodel, and tremolo calls transmit significantly farther at night than during the day. These results provide quantitative details of Common Loon vocal signaling strategies, revealing that this species calls when abiotic conditions are ideal for long-range signaling.

Effects of water depth and livelihood activities on plant species composition and diversity in Nyando floodplain wetland, Kenya	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The influence of water levels and livelihood activities on plant species composition, diversity and structuring of wetland ecosystem is a concern as wetlands undergo human exploitation and the increasing threat from climate change. To evaluate the effect of seasonal changes in water depth and human activities, plant density and species composition were assessed in wet and dry seasons and in natural and converted wetland zones of the Nyando papyrus wetland, Kenya. Three transects with different water regimes and livelihood activities were identified. Overall, 30 plant species were identified. In the less disturbed zone, differences between transects were small and 79 % (dry season) to 99 % (wet season) of the plant density consisted of obligate and facultative wetland plants. These groups were dominated by Cyperus papyrus and Vossia cuspidata. In the converted zone, facultative, facultative upland and upland plants became more important with 36 % of the plant density. The seasonally inundated zone had species diversity and species richness increased under dry conditions with more facultative upland species. In the converted zone, disturbance caused by vegetation removal, cropping and other livelihood activities lead to lower soil moisture and more colonization opportunity for facultative and upland species that are more adapted to dry conditions.					van Dam, Anne/M-4251-2013; Kariuki, Simon/AFT-6596-2022; KIPKEMBOI, JULIUS/ABF-1956-2021														0923-4861	1572-9834				APR	2014	22	2			SI		177	189		10.1007/s11273-013-9313-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-013-9313-7													WOS:000333163600006

Sympatric coexistence of both reproductive modes is known in zones of overlap. This renders the species a potentially valuable model organism to study the 'queen of evolutionary problems', i.e. why sex is so successful despite its costs (paradox of sex). In order to maximally exploit this potential, a broad knowledge of the species' ecology is essential, including an understanding of its life history and population dynamics. Here, the phenology of the species was followed in three temporary ponds through monthly (Spain) or fortnightly (Poland) samplings, throughout an inundation period. This study confirms the wide ecological tolerances of E. virens. Although the species is generally assumed to be univoltine, two hatching periods were observed in the Spanish sites. Biotic interactions, especially predation, appear to be the important determinants of population dynamics in long-hydroperiod sites. Abiotic conditions may influence population dynamics through their impact on egg hatching. In the site with male presence, the initially female-biased sex ratio evolved towards a balanced sex ratio through the season. No consistent differences in limb morphology were observed between females originating from the three study sites. On the other hand, valve size of adult females varied among sites, possibly influenced by local environmental conditions (mainly salinity and pH) as well as the expected genetic diversity.

Dynamics of ostracod populations from shallow lakes of Patagonia: life history insights	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY												Wetlands are one of the most valuable natural resources, providing a number of ecosystem services and socio-economic values. Small ponds sustain a rich aquatic biodiversity and because of their short hydrological regimen and small size are excellent environments for population studies of microcrustaceans such as ostracods. This study describes the population dynamics of the Ostracoda fauna in three temporary shallow lakes during one hydroperiod in Argentine Patagonia. Three cosmopolitan species were determined: Cypris pubera, Tonnacypris lutaria and Eucypris virens. Among them, T.lutaria is here reported for the first time from the Neotropical region. Multivariate ordination techniques were used to examine the relationships among environmental variables and ostracod density on each sampling site. High values of conductivity, absorption at 320 nm (as a measure of dissolved organic matter), dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature and chlorophyll a concentration correlated positively with ostracod density. All the populations studied reproduced parthenogenetically, and the life cycles of E.virens and C. pubera were followed in detail by weekly sampling of their populations. The former displayed continuous reproduction, whereas the latter showed a multivoltine strategy. The life history of C. pubera was affected by the seasonality of the habitat. The development rate correlated positively with water temperature; conductivity and temperature had a positive effect on adult size in C.pubera, while conductivity had a negative effect on adult size in E.virens. In this study, we present the first data set on the development and life history of ostracods in Patagonian freshwater environments. However, several questions remain and encourage us to further investigate the relative importance of ostracods in food webs, as well as the importance of inter-specific interactions between ostracods and other taxa.					; Perez, Alejandra Patricia/NTQ-2898-2025	Coviaga, Corina/0000-0002-2634-2354; Perez, Alejandra Patricia/0000-0003-2334-4191													0022-2933	1464-5262				MAY 11	2015	49	17-18					1023	1045		10.1080/00222933.2014.981310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2014.981310													WOS:000351764700003

Alburnus vistonicus, a potamodromous species inhabiting the Vistonis freshwater system in northern Greece, manages to cope with wide salinity fluctuations in Vistonis Lake, but the impact of the fragmented connectivity of the lake's two main freshwater suppliers, Kosynthos and Kompsatos rivers, has not been assessed. We analyzed the species whole reproductive cycle and we divided it into phases. Cyclicity was observed in gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter, while total fecundity remained constant prior to the onset of the spawning season. Stomach fullness and condition factor differed among the surveyed habitats. Successful spawning and multiple spawning were verified, as well as spawning migration and potamodromy. However, mature females with markers of recent spawning activity were captured also in the lake, suggesting spawning occurrence in the lake or a previously undocumented oscillatory behavior between the lake and the rivers during the spawning season and between sequential spawning events. Either behavior may serve as a mechanism to overcome the restricted spawning migration routes due to the fragmented river connectivity.

The Hg content variations are also reported between the rainy and the rising water seasons. Position of fish in the food chain and the source of carbon at the base of the food chain were determined using nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes ratios respectively. During the two seasons, the effect of the Hg biomagnification between the non-piscivorous and piscivorous fish of the three lakes is observed. The correlation between the mercury concentrations and the nitrogen isotopic ratios suggests that the fish mercury content variability is connected with the trophic position and size. Aside from classic observations on mercury biomagnification by certain species of fish (i.e. contents increase with size or trophic status), novel results were revealed as well, such as some species decrease of mercury contents with size of fish. Aquatic organisms in the Amazon are adapted to the complexity of trophic webs coupled with changes in environmental variables, depending on the location and/or the season, which results in a wide range of mercurial contamination among the Tapajs ichthyofauna.

Cross-comparison of cloud liquid water path derived from observations by two space-borne and one ground-based instrument in northern Europe	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is one of the target atmospheric parameters retrieved remotely from ground-based and space-borne platforms using different observation methods and processing algorithms. Validation of LWP retrievals is a complicated task since a cloud cover is characterised by strong temporal and spatial variability while remote sensing methods have different temporal and spatial resolutions. An attempt has been made to compare and analyse the collocated LWP data delivered by two satellite instruments SEVIRI and AVHRR together with the data derived from microwave observations by the ground-based radiometer RPG-HATPRO. The geographical region of interest is the vicinity of St. Petersburg, Russia, where the RPG-HATPRO radiometer is operating. The study is focused on two problems. The first one is the so-called scale difference problem, which originates from dissimilar spatial resolutions of measurements. The second problem refers to the land-sea LWP gradient. The radiometric site is located 2.5 km from the coastline where the effects of the LWP gradient are pronounced. A good agreement of data obtained at the microwave radiometer location by all three instruments (HATPRO, SEVIRI, and AVHRR) during warm and cold seasons is demonstrated (the largest correlation coefficient 0.93 was detected for HATPRO and AVHRR datasets). The analysis showed no bias of the SEVIRI results with respect to HATPRO data and a large positive bias (0.013-0.017 kg m(-2)) of the AVHRR results for both warm and cold seasons. The analysis of LWP maps plotted on the basis of the SEVIRI and AVHRR measurements over land and water surfaces in the vicinity of St. Petersburg revealed the unexpectedly high LWP values delivered by AVHRR during the cold season over the Neva River bay and over the Saimaa Lake and the abnormal land-sea LWP gradient in these areas. For the detailed evaluation of atmospheric state and ice cover in the considered geographical regions during the periods of ground-based and satellite measurements, reanalysis data were used. It is shown that the most probable reason for the observed artefacts in the AVHRR measurements over water and ice surfaces is the coarse resolution of the land-sea and snow-ice masks used by the AVHRR retrieval algorithm. The influence of a cloud field inhomogeneity on the agreement between the satellite and the ground-based data is studied. For this purpose, the simple estimate of the LWP temporal variability is used as a measure of the spatial inhomogeneity. It has been demonstrated that both instruments are equally sensitive to the inhomogeneity of a cloud field despite the fact that they have different spatial resolutions.

Seasonal patterns in the structure of the fish larvae assemblages in the lower Amazon River	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												This study assessed the phenology and functional structure of parental stocks of fish larvae, and evaluated how the species modulate their reproductive activities as a function of natural hydrological regimes in the lower Amazon River, Brazil. Larvae were collected using conical plankton nets monthly over two hydrological cycles between January and December 2013, and between May 2017 and April 2018. The collections were conducted around an alluvial island located near the municipality of Santarem, Para, Brazil. After identification, individuals were classified into four functional groups (e.g., life-history strategy, feeding habits, type of migration, and swimming-performance/microhabitat-use in the water column) based on species traits. The relationships between seasonal hydrology, environmental variables and larval assemblage structure were evaluated using multivariate analyses. A total of 31,347 fish larvae were collected, from nine taxonomic orders, 26 families, 40 genera and 53 species. The larval assemblages showed highly variable taxonomic and functional composition between different phases of the hydrological cycle (rising water, high water, receding water and low water) and were strongly influenced by environmental variables. Fish reproductive phenology in the lower Amazon is complex and distributed among the hydrological phases. The different ecological characteristics allow the species to withstand specific environmental conditions during each phase. Changes in the structure of larval assemblages indicate that hydrological variability is a key ecological factor influencing the reproductive dynamics of fish and reflects adaptive strategies used to reduce interspecific competition for space and food, maximising recruitment. The variation of fish reproduction across the hydrological cycle that we observed is a result of different ecological characteristics enabling species and functional groups to adapt to environmental conditions of each phase.

An insight into subterranean flow proposition around Alleppey mudbank coastal sector, Kerala, India: inferences from the subsurface profiles of Ground Penetrating Radar	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The mudbank formation along south-western Indian coast has been a scintillating phenomenon during monsoon season, and the source of mud is a debatable issue till now. In the midst of many hypotheses, the subterranean passage is considered a possible one but needs to have supportive scientific evidence. This present study endeavours to demonstrate the potential use of the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) in generating subsurface information to locate buried paleochannels in coastal zone which could act as the conduit for transport of mud from terrestrial sources to sea. The historical maps of the late 1600 s show that the present-day Vembanad Lake was a part of the nearshore area and the coastline was nearly 60 km inside, drained by the rivers from the Western Ghats. Due to shoreline migration towards the seaside since late Holocene, the present-day landforms came to existence while the earlier channels got buried under recent sand. Nearly 500-m-long GPR subsurface (6-m depth penetration) profile was generated, and various paleochannels were traced. These buried channels were categorised based on the pattern of their occurrences. Two erosional surfaces at around 1 and 2-m were mapped, and their controls on paleochannels were derived. During phase-I, many paleochannels were in active condition and due to heavy deposition during phase-II, though these channels managed to maintain themselves, but the width of their courses got narrowed and in recent times they got filled up and buried. The pre-monsoon and monsoon GPR profiles signify the high degree of wetness characteristics of these buried channels during monsoon season and their possibility of being passages for possible transport of water charged with fine clay materials through the unconsolidated in-filled material in these buried channels. This demonstrative and first-hand subsurface information through GPR studies would further support to facilitate in consolidating the subsurface evidence for strengthening the subterranean passage concept in the mudbank area of the south-western coast of India.

Nutrient load concept-reservoir vs. bay impacts: a case study from a semi-arid watershed	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Large flow-through reservoirs and lakes possess environmental gradients and monitoring programs are mostly adapted for cost and time effectiveness. Bay areas are often more isolated from the main water body and are likely to have unobserved different environmental processes and impacts. This study was performed at the Itaparica Reservoir, Sao Francisco River, located in semi-arid Northeast Brazil, with dendritic form. Water residence time in the Ico-Mandantes Bay was estimated by hydrodynamic flow and transport simulations. The P-chlorophyll a relationship was used to develop the P use efficiency coefficient for critical P load estimation of 25 mu g P L-1. Phosphorus sources and input rates into a bay and the respective reservoir were calculated and compared regarding their different origins for the period after flooding (1988) and for 2013. After impoundment, the P load highly exceeded the carrying capacity because of leaching and mineralization processes. In 2013, P inputs were still above this threshold, whereas inflow and sub-basin P export during the rainy season were crucial. But eutrophication processes have increased in the bay relative to the main water body. Hence, water in hydraulic isolated parts is prone to eutrophication processes, thus, bays have to be specially considered in water resource management.

The effects of seasons on the water quality improvement and on the community of plankton were evaluated in a CW system with the macrophytes Cyperus giganteus Vahl, Typha domingensis Pers., Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms and Pontederia cordata L. Water, plankton and macrophytes were sampled in the inflow and outflow during the dry and rainy seasons. Differences in temperature, precipitation, hydraulic loading rate (HLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), inlet mass loadings and plant biomass between seasons affected the treatment efficiency. High precipitation and the consequent increase in HLR along with an increase in temperature and lower macrophyte biomass, were correlated to lower rates of removal efficiency during the rainy season. The season with higher macrophytes abundance coincided with high retention of zooplankton and solids. Higher nutrient levels in the dry season corresponded with a dominance and abundance of r-strategist planktonic species. To increase the removal efficiency of nutrients and organic matter by CW systems, care should be taken to decrease the HLR especially in periods of high precipitation.

A 21-year record of vertically migrating subepilimnetic populations of Cryptomonas spp.	INLAND WATERS												The vertical distribution and diel migration of Cryptomonas spp. were monitored continuously for 21 years in mesotrophic Cross Reservoir, northeast Kansas, USA. The movements of these motile algae were tracked on multiple dates during July-October of each year using in situ fluorometry and optical microscopy of Lugol's iodine-preserved samples. Episodes of subepilimnetic diel vertical migration by Cryptomonas were detected and recorded on 221 different days between 1994 and 2014, with just 2 of these years (1998 and 2013) lacking any sampling events with deep peaks sufficiently large enough to track. Whenever a subepilimnetic layer of Cryptomonas was detectable, it was generally observed to ascend toward the bottom of the epilimnion beginning approximately at sunrise; to descend toward the lake bottom during the late afternoon and evening; and to remain as a deep-dwelling population until dawn of the following day. Moreover, there was high day-to-day consistency in the absolute water column depths at which the migrating algal cells would cease their ascending or descending movement. We believe this unique and remarkable dataset comprises the most detailed record of diel migratory behavior for any planktonic freshwater alga reported for a single freshwater lake.

This assemblage represents the largest concentration of tiger beetles in a single 1 degrees latitude / longitude square in Europe. General patterns of spatial and temporal segregation among species are discussed based on observations of 1462 specimens registered during an observation period of one year, from April to August. The different species of Cicindelini appear to be distributed over space and time, with little overlapping among them. Three sets of species replace each other phenologically as the season goes on. Most of the species occupy drying or dried salt lakes and salt marshes, with sparse vegetation cover. Spatial segregation is marked in terms of substrate and vegetation use. Calomera littoralis and M. melancholica have been observed mainly on wet soils; C. circumdata on dry open saline flats; C. dulcinea and C. paludosa in granulated substrates with typical halophytic vegetation; C. maura is often present in man-modified areas. Cephalota circumdata and C. dulcinea are included as species of special interest in the list of protected species in Castilla-La Mancha. Conservation problems for the Cicindelini assemblage arise from agricultural activities and inadequate use of sport vehicles. Attempts at restoring the original habitat, supressing old semi-industrial structures, may affect the spatial heterogeneity of the lakes, and have an effect on Cicindelinae diversity.					; Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Jorge/O-5312-2019; Garcia-Paris, Mario/AAA-7411-2019	Garcia-Paris, Mario/0000-0002-9361-9405; Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Jorge/0000-0003-3968-5257; 													1313-2989	1313-2970					2016		561					63	103		10.3897/zookeys.561.6042	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.561.6042								27006617					WOS:000369964000006

A preliminary study on the microzooplankton of Chilika Lake, a brackish water lagoon on the east coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Abundance and composition of microzooplankton in Chilika Lake were studied covering three seasons during 2012-2013. Ciliates (19 species), rotifers (13 species), crustacean larvae (2 taxa) and heterotrophic dinoflagellates (2 species) were the four major groups. Ciliates, however, have emerged as the most dominant group throughout the lake in all the seasons except in the freshwater-influenced areas. The average contribution of ciliates was highest (avg. 55.3 +/- 38.7 %) during the premonsoon season followed by post-monsoon (avg. 49.0 +/- 32.5 %) and monsoon (avg. 47.8 +/- 41.6 %) seasons. Crustacean larvae formed the second dominant group whose percentage contribution was marginally high in the premonsoon (avg. 41.2 +/- 38.8 %) followed by monsoon (avg. 29.1 +/- 27.0 %) and post-monsoon (avg. 28.7 +/- 23.4%). Results of cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling on abundance of microzooplankton depicted well-defined clusters. The stations with high salinity formed a different group indicating seasonal variation in species composition and abundance of microzooplankton is primarily governed by salinity.					; Srichandan, Suchismita/GRS-8988-2022	srichandan, suchismita/0000-0002-3709-2442; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2016	188	1							69	10.1007/s10661-015-5062-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-5062-9								26718950					WOS:000367880700069

Daniel; Leblanc, John Paul; Liskauskas, Arunas; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Spawning Season Distribution in Subpopulations of Muskellunge in Georgian Bay, Lake Huron	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Loss of spawning and nursery habitats has been implicated as a major factor in the widespread decline of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy populations in North America. Although there is limited evidence of spawning site fidelity in Great Lakes populations of Muskellunge, such behavior could result in recruitment failure if individuals return each year to spawning sites that have become degraded. We compared the spawning behaviors of individual Muskellunge across three subpopulations in Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, to address the hypothesis that the use of specific spawning sites and spawning site fidelity are independent of the habitat's suitability for successful recruitment. The study regions (southeastern, northeastern, and northern Georgian Bay) have experienced different impacts from human development and sustained low water levels. We radio-tagged 49 adult Muskellunge and tracked them for up to 3 years (between 2012 and 2015). Sufficient multiyear data were only acquired for 18 individuals in the southeastern region; among those fish, 16 showed fidelity to at least one activity center over 2-3 years. Male Muskellunge occupied significantly smaller activity centers and shallower depths than females during the spawning season. The locations of adult Muskellunge were in close proximity to current and historic nursery sites that had been identified in each region by other studies, supporting the close spatial linkage between spawning habitat and nursery habitat. This study is the first to confirm spawning site fidelity in Georgian Bay Muskellunge, and our results support the spatial association between spawning and nursery habitats. The repeated use of degraded habitat by spawning adults, as appears to be the case in southeastern Georgian Bay, highlights the need to identify and protect spawning and nursery habitats.					; Leblanc, John Paul/HKF-3090-2023	Leblanc, John Paul/0000-0002-4218-3138; 													0002-8487	1548-8659					2016	145	4					795	809		10.1080/00028487.2016.1152300	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2016.1152300													WOS:000379596200011

Concentrations of total Hg and reactive Hg, as well as Hg fluxes, usually exhibited a consistent diurnal trend, with elevated values observed during the day. The increasing reactive Hg concentrations and Hg fluxes were highly related to the incident intensity of solar radiation, suggesting that sunlight-induced processes played an important role in the transformation of Hg in the study area. Dissolved gaseous Hg concentrations experienced different diurnal variations among the sampling sites, with peak dissolved gaseous Hg at midday under sunny weather conditions and in the early morning under cloudy and/or partially cloudy weather conditions. The peak values of dissolved gaseous Hg observed at midday agree well with previous results and highlight the sunlight-induced production of dissolved gaseous Hg in freshwaters, whereas dissolved gaseous Hg peaks at night suggest that microbial activity might be an additional mechanism for dissolved gaseous Hg production in surface waters. Total Hg, reactive Hg, and dissolved gaseous Hg concentrations and Hg fluxes in the warm season were consistently higher than those in the cold season; this is probably attributable to the combined effect of seasonal variations of environmental parameters, transformation of Hg species, and microbial activities.

S	Talbot, MR; Williams, MAJ		Dumont, HJ		Talbot, Michael R.; Williams, Martin A. J.			Cenozoic Evolution of the Nile Basin	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											The Cenozoic evolution of the Nile basin reflects a complex interaction between tectonic, volcanic and climatic events. The Ethiopian and Ugandan headwaters of the Nile attain elevations in excess of 2 km, while the watersheds rise to over 5 km. The Ethiopian tributaries of the Nile (notably the Blue Nile/Abbai and the Atbara/Tekezze) provide the bulk of the flood discharge and sediment load, but the Ugandan tributaries, via the White Nile, provide the reliable dry season discharge responsible for maintaining perennial flow in the main Nile. The hydrological differences between the Blue and White Nile rivers reflect their very different geomorphic histories, reflecting the Cenozoic tectonic and volcanic evolution of their respective headwaters. The volume of rock eroded from the Ethiopian headwaters of the Blue Nile/Abbai and the Atbara/Tekezze river basins since the extrusion of the Oligocene Trap Series basalts 30 Ma ago amounts to 102,000 +/- 50 km(3) from a catchment area of 275,000 km(2). The volume of rock eroded from the Ethiopian headwaters region of the Blue Nile and Atbara rivers is comparable to that estimated for the total volume of the Nile delta and submerged Nile cone in the eastern Mediterranean, which amounts to 150,000 +/- 50,000 km(3). The concordance between these two independent estimates is consistent with an Ethiopian source for the bulk of the Nile cone sediment since the Pliocene, when there seems to have been an increase in erosion in the Blue Nile headwaters linked to an increase in the rate of tectonic uplift. The origin of the White Nile as a large, permanent river is intimately connected with the development of the western branch of the East African rift system. Prior to the onset of rifting much of the drainage from central Africa was directed westward, into the Congo basin. Rifting led to the capture of a number of major tributaries of the Congo River and the redirection of river systems, producing south-to-north directed axial drainage within the rift and radial drainage into the Victoria basin. Rifting and associated rift-flank uplift was also responsible for the development of the large lake basins (Victoria, Albert, Edward, George and Kyoga), which characterise the upper White Nile catchment. Exactly when drainage from the present headwaters became linked to the White Nile is still unclear, but it seems likely that Lake Victoria, which today provides around 90% of the runoff to the White Nile, may be no more than about 0.5 million years old. While rift development and ongoing rift-related tectonic activity have controlled the long-term evolution of the White Nile headwaters, it is clear that much of the shorter term variations in discharge are probably related to climate change. There is evidence of a progressive tendency to drier conditions over the past 1.5 Ma, which may have been related to the development of topographic barriers that limited the penetration of humid air masses into the continental interior. Superimposed on this long-term trend arc astronomically driven changes and brief, abrupt climatic excursions that were probably driven by events outside tropical Africa.																			0077-0639		978-1-4020-9725-6				2009	89						37	60				10.1007/978-1-4020-9726-3												WOS:000270040800003
J	Couture, P; Pyle, G				Couture, Patrice; Pyle, Greg			Live fast and die young: Metal effects on condition and physiology of wild yellow perch from along two metal contamination gradients	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												This review summarizes some of the main findings of our work with the Metals in the Environment Research Network examining seasonal and regional effects on metal accumulation, growth, condition, and physiology in wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from 10 lakes comprising two metal contamination gradients in the industrial regions of Sudbury, Ontario and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada. The specific objectives of this review are: (1) to propose threshold tissue metal concentrations to discriminate between fish from contaminated and reference sites; (2) to identify factors that can influence metal accumulation and fish condition; and (3) to define an experimental approach for measuring metal effects in wild yellow perch. Using tissue thresholds appeared useful not only for discriminating fish from clean or contaminated environments, but also provided a simple approach to examine metabolic consequences of tissue metal accumulation. Overall, fish from Sudbury grew faster, expressed higher aerobic capacities, and died younger, but also appeared better at limiting accumulation of some metals than Rouyn-Noranda fish. The condition of the latter fish was clearly more affected by metals than Sudbury fish. Finally, our dataset allows us to propose that yellow perch are highly suitable for ecological risk assessment studies of metal effects in wild fish, but that fish size, season, and region must be considered in sampling design and that several reference sites must be studied for meaningful conclusions to be reached.

Feeding habits of sand smelt (Atherina boyeri, Risso 1810) in Trichonis Lake (Western Greece)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The feeding habits of sand smelt (Atherina boyeri, Risso, 1810) from Trichonis Lake (Western Greece) were investigated. Stomach contents were analyzed from 240 specimens with total lengths ranging from 35 to 112 mm. Samples were taken at monthly intervals (January-December 1997). Of the total number of stomachs examined, 53 were empty (22.1%). However, values varied greatly with season (maximum in January: 50%; minimum in August: 7.6%). Prey analyses of stomach contents identified 15 important items (%Rn > 0.05) belonging to six major groups: crustacean (copepods, cladocera), mollusca (bivalve: larvae), insects (larvae), cestode worms and finfish (fry and eggs). Dominant prey were larvae of the bivalve Dreissena polymorpha (%Rn = 33.8), the copepods Eudiadomus drieschi (%Rn = 26.4) and the cladocera Diaphanosoma brachyurum (%Rn = 24.2). The importance of cladocera and copepods decreased with increasing size of the sand smelt, while the importance of bivalve larvae, fish eggs and finfish fry increased with increasing sand smelt size. Seasonal changes in diet composition and prey abundance in sand smelt stomachs were recorded as coinciding with the seasonal composition and abundance of the zooplankton community in the surface layers of Trichonis Lake. Bivalve larvae were the dominant prey of A. boyeri during January to May, while copepods and cladocera dominated from June to December.					; Katselis, George/ABK-5111-2022	Katselis, George/0000-0001-7807-5836; Tsifopanopoulos, Fotios/0000-0002-6822-4700													0175-8659	1439-0426				JUN	2007	23	3					209	214		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2006.00824.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2006.00824.x													WOS:000247132200005
J	Winfield, IJ				Winfield, IJ			Fish in the littoral zone: ecology, threats and management	LIMNOLOGICA					Lake Shores 2003 International Conference	JUN 19-21, 2003	Konstanz, GERMANY					The importance of the littoral zone of lakes to a diversity of fish species has been appreciated for many centuries, although the complexity and heterogeneity of this habitat have resulted in a poorer understanding of local fish ecology compared with that achieved for typically much larger but simpler offshore habitats. Lake fish species may occupy the littoral zone permanently or visit it on diel, seasonal or ontogenetic timescales in response to a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The purposes of such occupations include feeding, refuge from predation and, most importantly for many species, reproduction. The primary environmental threats to fish in the littoral zone arise from eutrophication, which may directly or indirectly alter feeding conditions through the loss of macrophytes, from increases or decreases in water level variations and from siltation rates, both of which may interfere with spawning or egg incubation, and from the introduction of alien species, many of which preferentially colonise the littoral zone where they may act as predators, competitors or environmental degraders. The management of these threats is best accomplished through general lake management measures such as the control of nutrient levels, but some actions specific to the littoral zone or its fish populations are also feasible. These include the replacement of lost or damaged spawning substrata, the active management of water levels at appropriate times of year, and, at least potentially, the deployment of artificial structures to provide appropriate physical habitat for adult fish.

Since such aggregates are seasonally abundant in the mixed upper layer of lakes, we hypothesized that particle-attached (PA) bacteria disproportionally contribute to the small-scale spatial beta diversity of pelagic communities. Community composition was analysed in sets of small (10 mL) samples collected from a pre-alpine lake in May, July and October 2018. Bacteria were classified as free-living (FL) or PA depending on their presence in large, 5-mu m pre-filtered reference samples. FL exhibited clear seasonal differences in community composition and assembly. They were spatially uniform in May and July, and only a few FL taxa exhibited significant spatial variability. Spatial heterogeneity of FL in October was caused by high alpha and beta diversity of rare taxa, many with a presumably 'tychoplanktic' (alternating attached and free-living) lifestyle. The spatial beta diversity of PA was always high, and only about 10% of their seasonal richness was present in any single sample. Thus, most compositional variability of pelagic bacteria at spatial scales of cm to m either directly or indirectly originated from PA. On a functional level, this genotypic heterogeneity might affect the spatial distribution of rare metabolic traits.

Growth of Hatchery-Reared Chinook Salmon in Lakes Michigan and Huron Exhibits Limited Spatial Variation but Is Temporally Linked to Alewife Abundance	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were introduced into Lakes Michigan and Huron in the 1960s to diversify recreational fisheries and reduce overabundant, nonnative Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. Alewife remain the primary prey of Chinook Salmon but have experienced substantial declines in abundance due to reduced food resources and salmonine predation pressure. The movements of Chinook Salmon have been linked to the density and spatial distribution of Alewife, but spatial patterns in Chinook Salmon growth have not been well documented and the temporal relationship between growth and Alewife density has not been evaluated during the current period of low Alewife abundance. We evaluated spatial and temporal variation in growth of Chinook Salmon in Lake Michigan and the U.S. waters of Lake Huron and explored linkages with Alewife density. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were generally similar for recaptured coded-wire-tagged Chinook Salmon from different stocking locations and different recovery locations. Only a few small differences among stocking and recovery regions were evident, with regions divided into two subtly different groups with shared growth parameters. The small regional differences may be attributable to unique habitat and/or stocking characteristics of specific regions. In Lake Michigan average Chinook Salmon length at age also varied across years and was tightly coupled with annual lakewide densities of age-1 and older Alewife, suggesting that Chinook Salmon growth from 2012 to 2016 was constrained by Alewife density. Our findings are consistent with evidence of lakewide movements associated with foraging and support continued management of Chinook Salmon in Lake Michigan as a single population. Furthermore, similar growth in Chinook Salmon from Lakes Michigan and Huron corroborates evidence that Chinook Salmon move from U.S. waters of Lake Huron to Lake Michigan to feed and reinforces the recent decision to include most fish stocked in northwestern Lake Huron in the Lake Michigan population when managing for predator-prey balance.

J	Guevara, G; Lozano, P; Reinoso, G; Villa, F				Guevara, Giovany; Lozano, Paola; Reinoso, Gladys; Villa, Francisco			Horizontal and seasonal patterns of tropical zooplankton from the eutrophic Prado Reservoir (Colombia)	LIMNOLOGICA												Zooplankton community analyses can reveal valuable information about the trophic status and secondary production in reservoirs. The zooplankton seasonal distribution and important physical and chemical parameters in Prado Reservoir (Tolima, Central Colombia) were studied in monthly surveys throughout a hydrological cycle (February 2000-January 2001) in order to establish seasonal patterns and the biotic and abiotic relationships for the reservoir. Surface zooplankton collections at I m depth were taken at six sampling stations with regard to reservoir morphometry, location of main tributaries and mixing areas of the incoming tributaries. Cladocerans numerically dominated (48.1%) the community throughout the study period followed by Copepoda (32.7%), Rotifera (19.1%), and Diptera larvae (0.01%). Among the cladocerans, there was a greater abundance of Bosmina longirostris (69.8%) than other crustaceans. Among the Rotifera, Brachionus falcatus was the most abundant with 23% and Keratella tropica was least abundant with 8%. The only cyclopoid species found was Thermocyclops decipiens. The phantom midge Chaoborus sp. was also part of the zooplankton community. Based on numbers, cladocerans represented a significant component of the zooplankton in both dry and rainy seasons. Four species (Brachionus spp., K tropica, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Ceriodaphnia cornuta, Moina sp., and T decipiens) had never previously been found in the reservoir, but were recorded for other standing Colombian water bodies. The replacement of B. longirostris instead of Daphnia sp. as dominant species was observed. The results of the comparison of the different studies confirmed that the trophic state of this artificial lake may be classified as eutrophic, and in general, physical, and chemical homogeneity were observed both spatially and temporally.

Samples were investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S and 18S rRNA genes and specific bands were sequenced. Cluster analysis of the DGGE profiles revealed that all of the samples grouped into two distinct clusters, in accordance with sampling site; while in each cluster, the divergence of sub-clusters correlated with sampling depth. Sequence analysis of selected dominant DGGE bands revealed that most sequenced phylotypes (84%) exhibited a parts per thousand yen97% similarity to the closest sequences in GenBank, and were affiliated with ten common freshwater plankton phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, Pyrrophyta, Cryptophyta, Ciliophora, Stramenopiles, and Rotifera). Several of these groups are also found worldwide, indicating the cosmopolitan distribution of the phylotypes. The relationships between DGGE patterns and environmental factors were analyzed by redundancy analysis (RDA). The results suggested that, total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and CODMn concentrations, and water temperature were strongly correlated with the variation in plankton composition.

Most of the world's wetland ecosystems are not adequately monitored for water level, flow, or discharge, and where these are monitored, gauges are usually located on the largest rivers or lakes and canals rather than in the seasonally flooded areas. Even those wetlands that have the most extensive networks of gauges are not sufficiently covered to understand the finer-scale spatial dynamics of hydrologic condition. However, high-density in situ monitoring of stage, flow, and discharge of vast wetland complexes would be prohibitively expensive, even in a region such as south Florida, USA where considerable resources are devoted to water management. Several techniques are presented that were developed to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery to remotely detect, monitor, and map regional scale spatial and temporal changes in wetland hydrology. This study shows that SAR imagery can be used to create inundation maps of relative soil moisture and flooding in non-woody wetlands. A comparison of in situ water-level data collected from 1997 to 1999 at 12 test sites to SAR imagery revealed that relative backscatter within a site does vary in a linear fashion with changes in water levels. Using SAR imagery collected between 1997 and 1999, inundation maps were created at approximately bi-monthly periods for the south Florida region. This time series of inundation/soil moisture maps (1997-1999) reveals the spatial and temporal variation in degree of flooding in the Greater Everglades, which is information previously unavailable from ground-based observations alone. In addition, hydroperiod maps were created based on a temporal series of 14 months of SAR imagery.

Multiple regression models using watershed characteristics and climatic variables explained 38% or less of the variance in HgT and MeHg. Land cover percentages and soil permeability generally provided modest predictive power. Percent wetlands alone explained 19% of the variance in MeHg in streams at low-flow, and it was the only significant (p<0.02) predictor for MeHg in lakes, albeit explaining only 7% of the variance. When stream discharge was added as a variable it became the dominant predictor for HgT in streams, improving the model r(2) from 0.19 to 0.38. Stream discharge improved the MeHg model more modestly, from r(2) of 0.25 to 0.33. Methylation efficiency (MeHg/HgT) was modeled well (r(2) of 0.78) when a seasonal term was incorporated (sine wave with annual period). Physical models explained 18% of the variance in fish Hg concentrations in 134 lakes and 55% in 20 reservoirs. Our results highlight the important role of seasonality and short-term hydrologic changes to the delivery of Hg to water bodies.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				MAR	2005	14	1-2					125	134		10.1007/s10646-004-6264-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-004-6264-z								15931963					WOS:000227700000010

Seasonal dynamics of evaporite mineral precipitation, dissolution, and back-reactions in shallow and deep hypersaline lakes	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Seasonal water temperature variations exhibit a first-order control on the mineralogy, texture, and timing of formation of modern, temperate zone lacustrine evaporites. However, seasonality is generally absent from the thermochemical models used to interpret ancient nonmarine evaporites. Here, a seasonal model is presented which correctly reproduced the complex history of evaporite precipitation, dissolution, and back-reactions observed during the drying up of the shallow (2.4 m) Owens Lake, California (ca. 1969). Additional parameters were then added to simulate a deep (>10 m), perennial lake with the same chemical composition (e.g., ancient Searles Lake). Variations in temperature drive saline mineral precipitation and syndepositional alteration in both models, but in different ways. In shallow, well-mixed temperate lakes, minerals crystallize and transform in rhythm with seasonal temperature fluctuations. In deeper stratified lakes, alteration occurs when salts settle from surface waters (variable seasonal temperatures) to the bottom waters (constant temperatures). The deep lake model shows that more than half of the salts that precipitate at low temperatures later dissolve or back-react in warmer bottom waters. Closed basin evaporite deposits formed in temperate lakes thus preferentially preserve high temperature salts. This means that midlatitude lacustrine evaporites contain more climatic and limnological information than previously recognized, and can be interpreted in terms of seasonal temperatures, mean annual temperatures, and lake depths.

The forest of the island is typically boreal and, at the time of the introduction, was dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white spruce (Picea glauca), and black spruce (P. mariana). Since then, the vegetation has been modified as a result of high deer density (16 deer.km(-2)) and heavy browsing. The most important change is the progressive decline of balsam fir stands, formerly the prevalent forest type. We describe that process at three spatial and time scales. On the largest scale (whole island, 100 y), we examined the age and species composition of stands on recent forest maps as well as the age structure of 2,555 individual balsam fir and white spruce trees. Balsam fir was largely dominant before 1930, but was replaced by white spruce afterwards. We also estimated that fir stands, which now cover 20% of the island, occupied about 40% of the total area initially. On an intermediate scale (1,200 km(2), 30 y), we examined the natural regeneration established after an insect outbreak that took place in 1971-1972 and massively killed predominantly balsam fir forests. In that area, white spruce regeneration now largely replaces that of balsam fir. On a finer scale (< 1 km(2), 3 y), we monitored 1,800 balsam fir seedlings (2-5 cm high) individually tagged. Seedlings were browsed throughout the snow-free season, and the annual browsing incidence in forest was estimated at 26%. Considering the present age of remnant fir stands, we estimate that most of these will have been eradicated in 40-50 y.																			1195-6860	2376-7626					2003	10	4					487	495		10.1080/11956860.2003.11682796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2003.11682796													WOS:000187465200010

There are three meander bends have been identified among the selected 61 curves which have high tendency of cut-off formation near future. The main controlling components are shear stress, radius of curvature, and tortuosity which have been considered to quantify the mechanism in positive and negative perspective. It will help to identify more possible cut-off lakes near future. This morphological dynamism is distinctly interlinked with the remarkable land transformation in the last 25 years. The changing behavior of land utilization are characterized by huge increase of cultivated lands and settlement which have mostly converted from uncultivated waste lands, agricultural wet lands (seasonaly used), and water bodies respectively.

We sought to expand understanding of stream habitat use by R. sierrae by investigating habitat suitability at the microhabitat and reach scales. We collected habitat availability and use data during 2016-2017 at five stream sites representative of geomorphic diversity in the northern Sierra Nevada mountains of California. At each frog use and availability location, we collected data on geomorphic unit type (e.g., riffles, pools), water depth, water velocity, substrate (e.g., gravel, cobble), and percent cover, including herbaceous, canopy, and total cover. Bootstrapped logistic regression models for all study sites combined indicated water depth and velocity were the strongest predictors of post-metamorphic (adult and subadult) use by R. sierrae, while substrate and total cover provided moderate improvement in microhabitat use predictions. Specifically, adults had the highest probability of use in microhabitats with 0.3 m depth and 0.1 m s(-1) velocity. For tadpoles, we found velocity was the strongest microhabitat predictor for all study sites combined, with the highest probability of use in habitats with 0.01 m s(-1). Site-level models highlighted the relative importance of non-hydraulic habitat variables, such as cover, when suitable depth and velocity conditions occurred. At the reach scale, we found hydraulic conditions varied widely in geomorphic units over time, but suitable microhabitat conditions emerged in differing geomorphic units as flows changed over the season. These data indicate that R. slerrae, like other ranid species, may be limited by hydraulically suitable habitat availability, but habitat preferences can be met in a variety of stream reaches when variations in flow conditions over time and space are considered.					; Peek, Ryan/H-4906-2015	Todd, Brian/0000-0003-3133-791X; Yarnell, Sarah/0000-0002-2061-892X; 													0045-8511	1938-5110				NOV	2019	107	4					676	693		10.1643/CH-19-213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CH-19-213													WOS:000502278100007

Although the response of SAV to water depth has been widely studied in different aquatic environments, little is known about the response of the SAV community to changes in water depth of a large lake after an extreme rainfall event. To examine this question, 780 samples were collected from Lake Taihu, China, between 2013 and 2017 to analyze the variations in SAV and water depth. The water level of the lake ranged from 2.75 to 4.87 m, and the water depth at sampling sites ranged from 1.07 to 3.31 m. The SAV biomass at the sampling sites ranged from 0 to 17.61 kg/m(2). The influence of water depth on SAV biomass and frequency of occurrence differed by seasons and by species. The adaptation of SAV species to increasing water depth is a key element for community dynamics, which in turn contributes to water level regulation. A new method was proposed to identify the optimal water depth for SAV biomass accumulation based on calculation of the cumulative probability and probability density.					hu, weiping/LIH-2020-2024															2073-4441				NOV	2019	11	11							2412	10.3390/w11112412	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11112412													WOS:000502264500214

Here we present a paleoclimate reconstruction from varved lacustrine sediments of Lake Lisan, Dead Sea Rift, for ca. 26.2-17.7 (calendar) ka. The age is based on a floating varve chronology anchored to radiometric dates. Our reconstruction indicates that small ice-rafting events (a, b, c, and d), as well as Heinrich events in the North Atlantic, are associated with the Eastern Mediterranean and intervals. Study of seasonal sub-laminae yields evidence of several additional decadal- to century-scale and events that correlate With cooler temperatures at higher latitudes. Analyses in the frequency domain indicate the presence of periodicities centered at 1500 yr, 500 yr, 192 yr, 139 yr, 90 yr, and 50-60 yr, suggesting a solar forcing on climate.					; Waldmann, Nicolas/AAC-3974-2020; Stein, Mordechai/AAJ-3200-2020	Goldstein, Steven L/0000-0001-7252-8064; Waldmann, Nicolas/0000-0003-4627-208X													0091-7613	1943-2682				JUL	2004	32	7					581	584		10.1130/G20553.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G20553.1													WOS:000222490800010

The remote estimation of CDOM is always a challenge in the field of water-colour remote sensing owing to its weak signal. To further study the CDOM-retrieval approach, field experiments, including water-quality analysis and spectral measurements, were carried out in Lake Taihu waters from 8 to 21 November 2007. On the foundation of analysing water-inherent optical properties, sensitive spectral factors were selected, and then neural-network models were established for retrieving CDOM. The results show that the model with 10 nodes in the hidden layer performs best, yielding a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.887 and a root-mean-square error of 0.156 m(-1). Meanwhile, the predictive errors of the model developed here and the previously proposed algorithms were compared with each other. The mean value of the relative error of the former is 12.8% (standard deviation of 29.9%), and is much lower than its counterpart of other models, which indicates that the developed model has a higher accuracy for CDOM retrieval in Lake Taihu waters. Meanwhile, other datasets collected at different times were also imported into the model for applicability analysis; the derived errors suggest a relatively good performance of the model. This research firstly explores the CDOM retrieval in optically complex lake waters, and the corresponding findings support a technical framework for accurately extracting CDOM information in Lake Taihu waters, based on an adequate understanding of water optical properties.					huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; huang, changchun/E-6580-2016; Le, Chengfeng/A-2584-2013; Lyu, Heng/F-3335-2017	huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X; huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663; 													0143-1161	1366-5901					2011	32	14					4005	4022		10.1080/01431161.2010.481297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2010.481297													WOS:000293232000010
J	Shetty, K; Gulimane, K				Shetty, Karunya; Gulimane, Krishnakumar			Application of microalgal diversity in assessing the water quality of freshwater ponds	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The health of an ecosystem can be evaluated based on its ecological characteristics and intrinsic biological quality. Furthermore, as nutrients are easily accessible by the algal cells in an aquatic ecosystem, the biochemical composition of an algal cell also varies accordingly with the ecological condition of its habitat. This study was carried out to understand the impact of seasonal variation of physicochemical parameters on the microalgal diversity and composition of five freshwater ponds in Mangalore, India. The diversity indices, viz. Shannon's (0.88-3.42), Margalef's (0.16-3.6), and Simpson's dominance index (0.47-0.96), were analyzed using PAST. A prominent variation in both the abundance and diversity of species was observed during the study period. About 150 species of algae belonging to Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Xanthophyceae, and Rhodophyceae were recorded. Of these groups, Chlorophyceae, specifically, desmids formed the dominant flora. Zygnematales were dominant during monsoon, while Chroococcales was the most dominant group during the post-monsoon season. Ecological conditions like temperature, pH, dissolved gases, and inorganic salts were found to impact the growth and abundance of microalgae. The ecological parameters showed a prominent effect on microalgal diversity. The results indicated that site SR was the least polluted and most diverse among the lentic habitats studied. It also had lesser noxious algal species which could be attributed to its nutrient composition.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2023	195	5							595	10.1007/s10661-023-11116-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11116-w								37079113					WOS:000984544000002
J	Steidl, J; Gliege, S; Semiromi, MT; Lischeid, G				Steidl, Joerg; Gliege, Steffen; Semiromi, Majid Taie; Lischeid, Gunnar			Groundwater flow reversal between small water bodies and their adjoining aquifers: A numerical experiment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The countless kettle holes in the Late Pleistocene landscapes of Northern Europe are hotspots for biodiversity and biogeochemical processes. As a rule, they are hydraulically connected to the shallow groundwater system. The rapid, intensive turnover of carbon, nutrients and pollutants in the kettle holes therefore has a major impact on the quality of the shallow groundwater downstream. As a result of high-evapotranspiration rates from their riparian vegetation or strong storm events, the process of downstream groundwater flow may stagnate and reverse back towards the kettle hole, making interactions between the groundwater and kettle hole more complex. Furthermore, the highly heterogeneous soil landscape in the catchment contributes to this complexity. Therefore, the present study aims to enhance our understanding of this complicated interaction. To this end, 24 model variants were integrated into HydroGeoSphere, capturing a wide range of uncertainties in quantifying the extent and timing of groundwater flow reversal between a kettle hole and the adjacent aquifer. The findings revealed that the groundwater flow reversal lasted between 1 month and 19 years at most and occurred in a distance of more than 140 m downstream of the kettle hole. Our results demonstrated that the groundwater flow reversal arises especially often in areas where the shallow aquifer possesses low-hydraulic conductivity. There may also be a recurrent circulating flow between the groundwater and kettle hole, resulting in solute turnover within the kettle hole. This holds particularly true in dry periods with medium to low-water levels within the kettle hole and a negative water balance. However, shallow groundwater flow reversals are not necessarily a consequence of seasonal effects. In this respect, the properties of the local shallow aquifer by far outweigh the effect of the kettle hole location in the regional flow regime.

Abrupt climate change in southeast tropical Africa influenced by Indian monsoon variability and ITCZ migration	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The timing and magnitude of abrupt climate change in tropical Africa during the last glacial termination remains poorly understood. High-resolution paleolimnological data from Lake Tanganyika, Southeast Africa show that wind-driven seasonal mixing in the lake was reduced during the Younger Dryas, Inter-Allerod Cool Period, Older Dryas, and Heinrich Event 1, suggesting a weakened southwest Indian monsoon and a more southerly position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone over Africa during these intervals. These events in Lake Tanganyika, coeval with millennial and centennial-scale climate shifts in the high latitudes, suggest that changes in ITCZ location and Indian monsoon strength are important components of abrupt global climate change and that their effects are felt south of the equator in Africa. However, we observe additional events in Lake Tanganyika of equal magnitude that are not correlated with high-latitude changes, indicating the potential for abrupt climate change to originate from within tropical systems.																			0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 11	2007	34	15							L15709	10.1029/2007GL029508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL029508													WOS:000248872100002

Efficacy of passive sampler collection for atmospheric NO2 isotopes under simulated environmental conditions	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY												RATIONALE: Nitrogen oxides or NOx (NOx= NO+ NO2) play an important role in air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. The isotopic compositions of anthropogenic and natural NO2 sources are wide-ranging, and they can be used to constrain sources of ambient NO2 and associated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds. While passive sample collection of NO2 isotopes has been used in field studies to determine NOx source influences on atmospheric deposition, this approach has not been evaluated for accuracy or precision under different environmental conditions. METHODS: The efficacy ofNO(2) passive sampler collection for NO2 isotopes was evaluated under varied temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions in a dynamic flux chamber. The precision and accuracy of the filter NO2 collection as nitrite (NO2-) for isotopic analysis were determined using a reference NO2 gas tank and through inter-calibration with a modified EPA Method 7. The bacterial denitrifer method was used to convert 20 mu M of collected NO2- or nitrate (NO3-) into N2O and was carried out on an Isoprime continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer. RESULTS: delta N-15-NO2 values determined from passive NO2 collection, in conditions of 11-34 degrees C, 1-78% RH, have an overall accuracy and precision of +/- 2.1%, and individual run precision of +/- 0.6%. delta O-18-NO2 values obtained from passive NO2 sampler collection, under the same conditions, have an overall precision of +/- 1.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Suitable conditions for passive sampler collection of NO2 isotopes are in environments ranging from 11 to 34 degrees C and 1 to 78% RH. The passive NO2 isotope measurement technique provides an accurate method to determine variations in atmospheric delta N-15-NO2 values and a precise method for determining atmospheric delta O-18-NO2 values. The ability to measure NO2 isotopes over spatial gradients at the same temporal resolution provides a unique perspective on the extent and seasonality of fluctuations in atmospheric NO2 isotopic compositions.

Host-Associated Bacteroides 16S rDNA-Based Markers for Source Tracking of Fecal Pollution in Laguna Lake, Philippines	MICROORGANISMS												Sources of fecal contamination in Laguna Lake, Philippines, were identified using a library-independent microbial source tracking method targeting host-associated Bacteroides 16S rDNA-based markers. Water samples from nine lake stations were assessed for the presence of the fecal markers HF183 (human), BoBac (cattle), Pig-2-Bac (swine), and DuckBac (duck) from August 2019 to January 2020. HF183 (average concentration = 1.91 log(10) copies/mL) was the most frequently detected, while Pig-2-Bac (average concentration = 2.47 log(10) copies/mL) was the most abundant. The detected marker concentrations in different stations corresponded to the land use patterns around the lake. Generally, all marker concentrations were higher during the wet season (August-October), suggesting the effect of rainfall-associated factors on the movement and retention of markers from sources. There was a significant association (? = 0.45; p < 0.001) between phosphate and the concentration of HF183, suggesting domestic sewage-derived pollution. The markers had acceptable sensitivity and specificity, i.e., HF183 (S = 0.88; R = 0.99), Pig-2-Bac (S = 1.00; R = 1.00), and DuckBac (S = 0.94; R = 1.00), and therefore may be used for the continuous monitoring of fecal pollution in the lake and in designing interventions to improve the quality of the lake water.					; Obusan, Marie Christine/KVB-6342-2024	Rivera, Windell/0000-0002-4659-6132; Obusan, Marie Christine/0000-0002-5453-1881; Nacario, Mae Ashley/0000-0002-3723-0403														2076-2607				APR 27	2023	11	5							1142	10.3390/microorganisms11051142	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11051142								37317116					WOS:000998196200001

Assessing the impact of global warming on windstorms in the northeastern United States using the pseudo-global-warming method	NATURAL HAZARDS												Windstorms resulting from intense synoptic-scale cyclones are an important natural hazard in the current climate of the northeastern United States, but their likely response to global climate non-stationarity is poorly understood. This study investigates the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting model applied at 3.3 km resolution to simulate historically important cold-season windstorms associated with Alberta Clippers (AC) and Colorado Lows (CL) and then examines how such events may evolve in the future using pseudo-global-warming (PGW) simulations. The simulations encompass approximately 14-day periods that include passage of both a primary-strong extratropical cyclone during which multiple stations exhibited 10-m wind speed observations > 20 ms(-1), and a secondary-weak mid-latitude cyclone. The thermodynamics changes projected in the pseudo-global-warming (PGW) experiments lead to a modest decline in maximum wind speeds. The marginal probability of 10-m wind speeds > 14.3 ms(-1) drops from 6.6 to 5.3% during the intense AC and from 9 to 6.5% for the intense CL. Similarly, the probability of nonzero precipitation in any grid cell/3-h time interval declines from 2.44% in the control simulation of the intense AC to 1.59% in the PGW simulation, and from 3.39 to 2.67% for the intense CL. Virtually all snow during the CL that occurred during March 2018 is simulated as other hydrometeor types in the PGW experiment, and the spatial extent and location of very heavy precipitation are also greatly modified.

A model of variability in Titan's atmospheric structure	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												Titan's atmosphere has been extensively studied during the Cassini-Huygens Mission. The polar environment undergoes considerable seasonal variation and is distinct from the more quiescent equatorial environment experienced by the Huygens probe in 2005. The thermal structure of the upper atmosphere is affected by interaction of Titan's atmosphere with the plasma and energetic particles in Saturn's magnetosphere or in the solar wind. Titan's polar regions, and its hydrocarbon lakes in particular, are of interest for future exploration as is the complex organic chemistry that takes place in the upper atmosphere. Thus, specific environmental models are required for future exploration. Furthermore, the models developed to support the design of Huygens had to accommodate wide uncertainties, requiring large design margins. The extensive observations by the Cassini spacecraft (and indeed Huygens itself) provide a basis for narrowing these uncertainties, notably in composition. We provide a description of these new data sets, their scientific basis, and present limitations. The empirically constrained neutral temperatures and densities presented here also have important implications for fundamental chemical modeling. The empirical modeling presented here provides constraints on these models, which will lead to improved estimations of chemical products. Therefore, the paper describes a new model of Titan's atmospheric structure to guide both scientific studies and future engineering studies of exploration of the Saturn system. Of particular interest are aero-capture and aero-braking missions that may enable future exploration of the Saturnian satellite system.

Seasonal study of contamination by metal in water and sediment in a sub-basin in the Southeast of Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The spatial and temporal occurrence of heavy metals (Al, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni) in water and sediment samples was investigated in a sub-basin in the southeast of Brazil (Sao Carlos, SP). All samples were analysed using the USEPA adapted metal method and processed in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The discriminant analysis demonstrated that there are significant seasonal differences of metal distribution in the water data, but there are no differences to sediment. The basin studied has high levels of contamination by toxic metals in superficial water and sediment. The superficial water, in the rainy season, presented high levels of Cr, Ni, Pb and Cd, while in the dry season it presented high levels of Zn and Ni. The Principal Component Analysis demonstrated that the season has a huge influence on the levels, types and distribution of metals found in water. The source of contamination was probably diffuse, due to products such as batteries and fluorescent lamps, whose dump discharge can contaminate the bodies of water in the region in the rainy season. Due to fires from the harvest of sugar cane, high levels of Zn were found into the environment, in the dry season.					; Chiba, Wagner/K-2912-2014; Passerini, Mariana/J-6205-2015	Chiba de Castro, Wagner Antonio/0000-0002-6349-8999; 													1519-6984	1678-4375				NOV	2011	71	4					833	843		10.1590/S1519-69842011000500004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842011000500004													WOS:000297751800004

Therefore, a better understanding of past natural climate variability may help to establish the actual anthropogenic contribution to the observed climatic trend. A variety of high-resolution proxies now exist for documenting climate variability that has occurred in the northern hemisphere over the last 10 ka. In contrast, high-resolution paleoclimate records are more limited for regions such as high altitudes in the Andes/South America. However, many regions of the Andes contain a rich, but as yet overlooked, paleoclimate archive in the form of thick peat deposited in situ by the Distichia plant. In our study, based on altitudinal transect from the Peruvian Andes, we found a statistically significant and strong relationship between the stable carbon isotope composition of Distichia and air temperature (R=0.92 p<0.01). We also confirmed good preservation of relative differences in the original stable carbon isotope composition in peat derived from this plant. Our calibration showed that a decrease of similar to 0.97 +/- 0.23 parts per thousand in the stable carbon isotope composition of Distichia peat reflects a 1 degrees C increase in mean air temperature of the growing seasons. This relationship can be used as a new high-resolution proxy for reconstruction of paleotemperature variations over the past several thousand years in the Andes Mountains based on Distichia peat cores.

The data are divided into two seasons, i.e., the flood and dry seasons. It was suggested that the surface deformation is related to the distribution of the river network and water flow activities. During the dry season, the water flow is active along the internal river, scouring the surrounding soil. During the flood season, the water flow basically occurs around the external drainage network. By qualitatively comparing surface deformation and precipitation changes as well as changes in soil erosion, it is found that the deformation was highly related to soil erosion and seasonal precipitation. The precipitation in the flood period is heavy than that in the dry season. Therefore, the runoff with amount silt will scour the soil in the passing area, resulting obvious surface deformation.

The research focuses on detecting, monitoring, and predicting water quality in the EKW region using eight parameters-normalized suspended material index (NSMI), suspended particular matter (SPM), total phosphorus (TP), electrical conductivity (EC), chlorophyll-alpha, floating algae index (FAI), turbidity, Secchi disk depth (SDD), and two water quality indices such as Carlson tropic state index (CTSI) and entropy-weighted water quality index (EWQI). The results demonstrate that SPM, turbidity, EC, TP, and SDD improved while the FAI and chlorophyll-alpha increased during the lockdown period due to the stagnation of water as well as a reduction in industrial and anthropogenic pollution. Moreover, the prediction of EWQI using an artificial neural network indicates that the overall water quality will improve more if the lockdown period is sustained for another 3 years. The outcomes of the study will help the stakeholders develop effective regulations and strategies for the timely restoration of lake water quality.

J	Pöysä, H				Poysa, Hannu			Impacts of climate-driven changes in habitat phenology on dynamics of niche overlaps and spatial associations in a boreal waterbird community	OIKOS												A fundamental, yet little-explored, question is if climate change has affected niche relationships and spatial associations of native non-invasive species in established local communities, potentially affecting interspecific interactions and community organization. Here, long-term (1991-2020) changes in habitat niche overlaps (HNOs; measured in terms of three habitat categories describing the amount and development of shore vegetation and shore depth) and spatial associations (SAs; measured as co-occurrence on lakes) were studied in relation to climate-driven changes in habitat phenology in a community of eight migratory waterbird species breeding on 37 lakes in southeastern Finland. Overall timing of ice-out date (IOD) and within-season variation in the timing of ice-out (standard deviation of IOD, SDIOD) in lakes determine habitat (lake) availability for waterbirds during the settling phase. Previous work has documented that IOD has advanced and SDIOD increased during 1991-2020, with species responding differently to these changes in their habitat use. HNO and SA varied considerably in the 28 species pairs of eight species during the study period. The effect of IOD and SDIOD on that variation was generally small, effect sizes differing from zero only in eight out of 112 cases. However, the direction and magnitude of the effects of IOD and SDIOD on HNO and SA varied considerably among the species pairs. Although not statistically significant, overall differences in the direction and magnitude of the effect sizes suggested that the impacts of IOD and SDIOD on HNO and SA were stronger in species pairs in which the species were more similar in terms of settling phenology, and stronger for early settling species than for late settling species. Observed changes in niche relationships probably reflect changes in interspecific interactions and affect the possibilities for heterospecific information use in habitat selection.

The change in the concentrations of elements was contingent on the season, the temperature of the air and water, the activity of phyto- and zooplankton and regional changes in the environment (floods, earthquakes, fires, tourism, ships, technogenesis etc.). We compared the concentrations of trace elements present in the water samples from the Angara source and the water samples from Lake Baikal with the maximum permissible concentration values for drinking water. The calculated (median) concentrations for water samples from the Angara source, which spanned the entire study period, were close to the data obtained for the Baikal water.

Urban Areas Create Refugia for Odonates in a Semi-Arid Region	INSECTS												Simple Summary In semi-arid regions like western Texas (USA), there is limited natural habitat available for wetland organisms like odonates (dragonflies and damselflies), due to water scarcity that is compounded by anthropogenic land-use activities (primarily agriculture) that compromise water presence and quality. Other forms of anthropogenic land use, however, create wetland habitat for regional biodiversity through the construction of urban stormwater catchments. We surveyed adult odonates at 133 wetlands (49 in natural grassland settings, 56 in cropland, and 28 in urban areas) in western Texas from 2003-2020. Playas in an urban setting had greater species richness than those surrounded by grassland or cropland. We recorded 33 odonate species, seven of which were found only in urban wetlands, compared to two unique species in cropland wetlands and one unique species in grassland wetlands. The remaining 23 species occurred in multiple wetland types. The odonate community in urban wetlands was distinctly different from those in non-urban wetlands. Urban wetlands were not larger in surface area than the other wetland types, but because they were fed from more consistently available urban runoff, they held water longer, even during severe regional droughts. By concentrating water in an otherwise dry area, human environments can support more odonate species than would otherwise be present. Thus, although anthropogenic activities are often seen as being detrimental to biodiversity, some activities can actually create refugia for wildlife. In western Texas, most wetlands are fed from precipitation runoff, making them sensitive to drought regimes, anthropogenic land-use activities in their surrounding watersheds, and the interactive effect between these two factors. We surveyed adult odonates in 133 wetlands (49 in grassland settings, 56 in cropland, and 28 in urban areas) in western Texas from 2003-2020; 33 species were recorded. Most species were widespread generalists, but urban wetlands had the highest species richness, as well as the most unique species of any of the three wetland types. Non-metric, multidimensional scaling ordination revealed that the odonate community in urban wetlands was distinctly different in composition than the odonates in non-urban wetlands. Urban wetlands were smaller in surface area than the other wetland types, but because they were fed from more consistently available urban runoff rather than seasonal precipitation, they had longer hydroperiods, particularly during a multi-year drought when wetlands in other land-cover contexts were dry. This anthropogenically enhanced water supply was associated with higher odonate richness despite presumably impaired water quality, indicating that consistent and prolonged presence of water in this semi-arid region was more important than the presence of native land cover within which the wetland existed. Compared to wetlands in the regional grassland landscape matrix, wetlands in agricultural and urban areas differed in hydroperiod, and presumably also in water quality; these effects translated to differences in the regional odonate assemblage by surrounding land-use type, with the highest richness at urban playas. Odonates in human environments may thus benefit through the creation of a more reliably available wetland habitat in an otherwise dry region.

Impact of chemical and microbiological water quality on bacterial community assemblage of San Juan River (Sierra del Rosario, Biosphere Reserve, Cuba)	TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA												The objective of the present study was to analyze the influence of different physicochemical and microbiological indicators on bacterial assemblages in a freshwater ecosystem located in a Biosphere Reserve. The bacterioplankton communities composition was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rDNA during three sampling campaigns in three sampling stations of San Juan River. Multivariate statistical analyses of gel patterns, in relat ion to chemical, biological and physical parameters were performed. The analyses showed a seasonal variation of bacterial community at the less polluted stations. The correspondence canonical analysis showed that total dissolved solids (TDS), E. coli concentration and dissolved oxygen were significantly influencing the DGGE profiles at San Juan River, indicating that at least two of the three sampling stations analyzed possessed good water quality. With the combination of environmental variables and the DGGE molecular data it could be appreciated the influence of chemical and microbial contamination on the bacterial community of San Juan River. At the less polluted stations low concentrations of TDS and bacterial indicators of fecal contamination were related with bacterial diversity. The present investigation constitutes the first culture-independent analysis of freshwater bacterial communities in a Biosphere Reserve of the Caribbean islands.					; Esteve-Núñez, Abraham/AAD-4221-2020; BOLTES, KARINA/ABF-7916-2021	Larrea Murrell, Jeny Adina/0000-0002-6067-6331; BOLTES, KARINA/0000-0001-9686-7730; Rojas Badia, Marcia Maria/0000-0003-4958-1873; Esteve-Nunez, Abraham/0000-0003-4857-9616; 													0187-8336	2007-2422				MAY-JUN	2021	12	3					82	123		10.24850/j-tyca-2021-03-03	http://dx.doi.org/10.24850/j-tyca-2021-03-03													WOS:000657360900003

We have discovered the lacustrine MSCSs, the interstratified siliciclastic-carbonate sediments and the textural mixture of siliciclastic and carbonate materials (s-MSCSs) in the second member of the Paleogene Funing Formation (E(1)f(2)) in the Gaoyou and Jinhu sags, Subei Basin, eastern China. We use core, mud-log and thin-section data to clarify the E(1)f(2) s-MSCSs into five types, and we also use geochemical data of the E(1)f(2) mudstone including X-ray diffraction (XRD) whole rock, XRD clay, and trace elements to quantitatively analyze lake paleosalinity. The E(1)f(2) s-MSCSs mainly consist of siliciclasts, ooids, intraclasts, and mud, and they could be siliciclast-dominated, allochem-dominated, or without dominant components. We analyze that mixed sediments occur under either traction flow or gravity flow. The s-MSCSs of the traction flow origin develop small-scale, wavy cross-bedding and consist of siliciclasts and ooids of similar size; the s-MSCSs of the gravity flow origin develop massive bedding and graded bedding with complex lithology, and they mainly consist of siliciclasts and allochems of different size. We hypothesize that the increase of lake paleosalinity controlled by the climate and the moderate siliciclast influx under stable tectonic setting provide the material source for s-MSCSs in the lacustrine basin. Multidirectional flow is common during the deposition of s-MSCSs of traction flow origin, and seasonal flooding produces s-MSCSs of the gravity flow origin. Lacustrine s-MSCSs in the Gaoyou and Jinhu sags have significantly smaller scale and quantity, and ooids rather than bioclasts occupy most of the carbonate components.					; Zhu, Shifa/S-2868-2019	Zhu, Shifa/0000-0001-5048-2181; 													2324-8858	2324-8866				MAY	2021	9	2					SC1	SC16		10.1190/INT-2020-0088.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/INT-2020-0088.1													WOS:000654267900007

Evidence for exposure to selenium by breeding interior snowy plovers (Charadrius nivosus) in saline systems of the Southern Great Plains	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Interior snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus) population declines and deteriorating conditions throughout the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma may be linked to environmental contaminants. Concentrations of V, As, Cd, Pb, and Se were quantified in breeding snowy plover blood, feathers (5th primary; P5), and potential prey (tiger beetles [Cicindela circumpicta and C. togata]). Se was (a) most commonly detected relative to other quantified elements and (b) frequently quantified at levels exceeding background or toxicity thresholds. Of samples greater than instrumentation detection limits, 98% of snowy plover blood and 22% of feather samples were greater than Se toxicity thresholds of 1 ppm ww for blood and 5 ppm dw for feathers (blood quantifiable range: 0.83-15.12 ppm; feathers quantifiable range: 1.90-27.47 ppm). Almost all tiger beetle Se concentrations were below reported invertebrate thresholds of 30 ppm dw (quantifiable range: 0.54-45.84 ppm). Snowy plover blood Se concentrations were related to sex, individual body condition, and local tiger beetle Se concentrations, while plover P5 Se concentrations were related to state, sex, and presence of body molt. Tiger beetle Se concentrations were related to individual study sites in Texas. These results provide some of the first evidence of Se exposure risk for interior snowy plovers nesting in saline lake and alkali flat environments of the SGP. Future efforts should focus upon specific Se uptake pathways during breeding and nonbreeding seasons, as snowy plovers breeding in the SGP appear to be exposed to Se throughout their annual cycle.					; Comer, Christopher/AAF-9722-2021	Collins, Dan/0000-0003-1113-4736; French, Amanda D/0000-0002-8417-6091; Ashbaugh, Hannah/0000-0003-3319-7113													0963-9292	1573-3017				AUG	2018	27	6					703	718		10.1007/s10646-018-1952-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-1952-2								29845516					WOS:000439474000007

Addition of silver nanoparticles has no long-term effects on natural phytoplankton community dynamics in a boreal lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Lake phytoplankton communities are dynamic with well-documented seasonal variability in taxonomic composition and biomass. However, this variability has been largely overlooked when assessing the risk posed to aquatic ecosystems by the antimicrobial agent, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Here, we report results from a whole lake AgNP addition study at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area that assessed the effects of AgNPs on phytoplankton. Phytoplankton communities were largely unaffected in terms of taxonomy, pigment concentration, and biomass by AgNP additions. These negative toxicological results are due to community changes being more strongly affected by natural processes, such as temperature and dissolved nutrients. We conclude that AgNP exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations for 2 yr did not affect phytoplankton communities in boreal lakes, which emphasizes the importance of incorporating natural variability into analyses that attempt to determine the effect of contaminants on aquatic ecosystems.					; Paterson, Michael/AGT-8809-2022; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021	Xenopoulos, Marguerite A./0000-0003-2307-948X; 														2378-2242				AUG	2018	3	4					311	319		10.1002/lol2.10071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10071													WOS:000456696600001

The structure of the modes was inferred from power spectral density of measured and simulated isotherm vertical displacements and from rotary-power spectral density of isopycnal velocities obtained from numerical simulations. The shape of the lake at the level of the thermocline, in conjunction with the dispersion relationship, determines the horizontal configuration of the natural modes. The dominant response to wind forcing was an azimuthal and vertical mode I Kelvin wave with a natural period of 22.6 h that propagated around the entire basin; the second most dominant response was a vertical mode I wave with a natural period close to 10.5 h and composed of two counter-rotating Poincare circular cells. The sloping bottom produced an intensification of vertical displacements and velocities over the slope due to focusing of waves rays after reflection at bottom slopes close to the critical angle. The amplitude of the observed oscillations was very sensitive to the phase of the wind relative to the existing waves; resonance was affected by the cessation time of the wind events because it defines the local forcing period and resets the phase of the observed oscillations.

Mayamaea pannonica sp. nov. possesses typical characteristics of the genus Mayamaea, such as uniseriate striae and hymenes that cover the areolae from the outside. It can easily be distinguished from similar species by the valve outline and shape of the central area. Although presently no culture of the species is available, we identified in an amplicon data set from the same sample a partial 18S rRNA gene sequence that is thought to represent the new species, with high probability. A comparison of our sequence to those present in the Diat.barcode and NCBI databases showed that the sequence is closely related to, but significantly different from, that of Mayamaea terrestris. Natural saline habitats in Serbia and neighbouring countries are under anthropogenic threat and climate change, so knowing which species live here is the first step in preserving these unique habitats.

Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and has historically been a flood-prone area. A detailed field experiment was conducted in the Xiushui River, China, before and after the flood season. The grain-size distribution analysis method was used to determine the hy-draulic conductivity of the riverbank. A total of 116 sediment samples were collected from the test site. An in situ permeameter test was used to confirm the consistency of the spatial distribution trend of the estimated hydraulic conductivity based on the grain-size distribution analysis. A Kruskal-Wallis test of the riverbank sediment K values obtained before and after the flood season showed that they belong to different populations. The prob-ability distribution illustrated the strong heterogeneity of the riverbank sediments before and after the flood season. Previous studies have confirmed the presence of strong hyporheic exchange and biological processes at this study site. Following the flood season, the K values had a higher mean, median, and coefficient of variation, confirming that the flood process enhanced the heterogeneity of the riverbank sediments. Overall, the hydraulic conductivity of the three areas changed with distance from the river; the closer the area was to the river, the smaller the hydraulic conductivity and weaker the heterogeneity. An experimental framework of spatio-temporal variability in riverbank sediments is proposed, providing recommendations for researchers on conducting an integrated experiment.					wu, chengcheng/HTR-3589-2023; Zhou, Wei/E-5636-2011														0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2023	228								107172	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107172		APR 2023											WOS:001010768800001

Here we distinguish between hydrometeorological forcing of phytoplankton dynamics at time scales from days to decades based on a 54-year monthly phytoplankton time series from a large shallow Lake Vortsjarv (58 degrees 16 ' N, 26 degrees 02 ' E) in Estonia, combined with daily data on forcing factors-thermal-, wind-, light- and water-level regimes. By using variance partitioning with linear mixed effect modelling (LME), we found a continuum from the large dominant K-selected filamentous cyanobacteria with strongest decadal scale variation (8-30%) to r-selected phytoflagellates with large stochastic variability (80-96%). External forcing revealed strong seasonal variation (up to 80%), while specifically water level and wind speed had a robust decadal variation (8% and 20%, respectively). The effect of external variables was proportionally manifested in the time scales of phytoplankton variation. Temperature, with a clear seasonal variation, had no impact on the dominant cold tolerant filamentous cyanobacteria in Lake Vortsjarv. We found the LME as a reliable method for resolving the temporal cross-scale problem. It yielded quantitative results that matched our intuitive understanding of the dynamics of different variables.

Catch distribution and size structure of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in Lake Tana, Ethiopia: implications for fisheries management	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is the most important species for consumption and economic purposes in Lake Tana, yet, tilapia stocks have declined drastically over the past decades because of anthropogenic impacts. Thus, effective conservation management is required urgently. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution and size structure of O. niloticus populations in Lake Tana in order to evaluation conditions to promote sustainable exploitation. Data were collected monthly at three sites on the lake from April 2016 to March 2017. The size at first maturity was computed using logistic regression. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) of O. niloticus in Lake Tana has sharply declined from 75?kg trip(?1) in 2001 to 24?kg trip(?1) in 2016/2017. The mean CPUE values between sites and seasons were significantly different. The size at first maturity for O. niloticus was 21?cm in 2016/2017. Of the catches taken, more than 24% of those were motorised and reed boat fisheries and 46% of the chase-and-trap fishery catches were below the size at first maturity in 2016/2017. Additionally, large size specimens were rarely recorded. Widening the mesh size of the gillnets would give a chance for immature fish to spawn at least once. Considering the fish size distribution and social context of the fishers, limiting mesh size could be a more feasible management option than a closed season.																			1608-5914	1727-9364				OCT 18	2019	44	3					273	280		10.2989/16085914.2019.1637710	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2019.1637710		OCT 2019											WOS:000491811400001

Seasonal dynamics of population genetic structure in cryptic taxa of the Pellioditis marina complex (Nematoda: Rhabditida)	GENETICA												The distribution patterns and genetic structure of the Pellioditis marina species complex in Belgium and The Netherlands were compared between four consecutive seasons. Different types of habitats (coast, estuary, semi-estuary and lake) with different degrees of connectivity were sampled. In addition, each habitat type was characterised by either temporal or permanent algal deposits. We screened 426 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c (COI) gene with the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method in 1615 individuals of Pellioditis marina. The 51 haplotypes were divided into four (sympatric) lineages, with divergences ranging from 0.25 to 10.6%. Our results show that the lineages have different temporal dynamics, which may be linked to abiotic factors. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) indicated a significant structuring in the PmI lineage, which correlated with habitat characteristics and which changed over time (Mantel, r = 0.51; p = 0.126). Intrapopulational diversity was similar in all locations, and temporal changes in haplotype frequencies were not higher in temporary than in permanent algal deposits. Instead, the results of the temporal survey indicated that (some) P. marina populations are characterised by a metapopulation structure. It is emphasized that a complete and correct interpretation of processes causing genetic structuring within species and of the genetic structure itself can only be done when analyses are performed at several time points.

Carbon and water cycling in lake-rich landscapes: Landscape connections, lake hydrology, and biogeochemistry	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] Lakes are low-lying connectors of uplands and wetlands, surface water and groundwater, and though they are often studied as independent ecosystems, they function within complex landscapes. One such highly connected region is the Northern Highland Lake District (NHLD), where more than 7000 lakes and their watersheds cycle water and carbon through mixed forests, wetlands, and groundwater systems. Using a new spatially explicit simulation framework representing these coupled cycles, the Lake, Uplands, Wetlands Integrator (LUWI) model, we address basic regional questions in a 72-lake simulation: ( 1) How do simulated water and carbon budgets compare with observations, and what are the implications for carbon stocks and fluxes? ( 2) How do the strength and spatial pattern of landscape connections vary among watersheds? ( 3) What is the role of interwatershed connections in lake carbon processing? Results closely coincide with observations at seasonal and annual scales and indicate that the connections among components and watersheds are critical to understanding the region. Carbon and water budgets vary widely, even among nearby lakes, and are not easily predictable using heuristics of lake or watershed size. Connections within and among watersheds exert a complex, varied influence on these processes: Whereas inorganic carbon budgets are strongly related to the number and nature of upstream connections, most organic lake carbon originates within the watershed surrounding each lake. This explicit incorporation of terrestrial and aquatic processes in surface and subsurface connection networks will aid our understanding of the relative roles of on-land, in-lake, and between-lake processes in this lake-rich region.

Of the four lakes investigated, two were of the clearwater type and had dense stands of submerged macrophytes while two others were of the turbid type characterized by the occurrence of phytoplankton blooms. One turbid and one clearwater lake had high nutrient levels (total phosphorus, >100 mug liter(-1)) while the other lakes had relatively low nutrient levels (total phosphorus, <100 mug liter(-1)). For each lake, seasonal changes in the bacterial community were related to bottom-up (resources) and top-down (grazers) variables by using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Using an artificial model dataset to which potential sources of error associated with the use of relative band intensities in DGGE analysis were added, we found that preferential amplification of certain rDNA genes over others does not obscure the relationship between bacterial community composition and explanatory variables. Besides, using this artificial dataset as well as our own data, we found a better correlation between bacterial community composition and explanatory variables by using relative band intensities compared to using presence/absence data. While bacterial community composition was related to phytoplankton biomass in the high-nutrient lakes no such relation was found in the low-nutrient lakes, where the bacterial community is probably dependent on other organic matter sources. We used variation partitioning to evaluate top-down regulation of bacterial community composition after bottom-up regulation has been accounted for. Using this approach, we found no evidence for top-down regulation of bacterial community composition in the turbid lakes, while grazing by ciliates and daphnids (Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia) was significantly related to changes in the bacterial community in the clearwater lakes. Our results suggest that in eutrophic shallow lakes, seasonality of bacterial community structure is dependent on the dominant substrate source as well as on the food web structure.

Paleosols, regional groundwater tables, abiotic proxy data and pollen of aquatic plants in lake sediments.; show a marked and rapid shift from very humid late-glacial/early Holocene climatic conditions (between ca. 14 and 9.5 kyr B.P.) to extremely dry mid-Holocene conditions (more and than today between ca. 9 and 4 kyr B.P.). An exception during this hyperarid period is a century-scale more humid interval around ca. 5.5-6 kyr B.P. that appears systematically in lake sediment archives. In contrast, pollen for most terrestrial plants preserved in lake sediments do not show major changes during the Holocene, whereas more humid mid-Holocene conditions (compared with late Holocene conditions) were inferred from plant macrofossils in rodent middens. Is the reason for.. this disagreement to be attributed to misinterpretation of the paleoenvironments or of the proxy records themselves', or to incomplete paleoclimatic interpretation of the paleoenvironments? We argue that these different paleoclimate archives record different aspects and facets of 'climate'. While paleosols and groundwater in the Atacama Desert record low-frequency climate variability at century to millennium scales, lake sediments on the Altiplano record decade- to century-scale variability. Terrestrial vegetation responds to shorter high-frequency climate variability at seasonal to, inter-annual scales and preferably to humid years. Vegetation remains in 'hibernation' or does not germinate during and years. Thus information from these three types of archives is not a priori comparable and requires careful site-specific, archive-specific and time-scale-specific evaluation. What is natural in modem climatology is also true for paleoclimatology: a comprehensive assessment must account for the complex daily and seasonal cycles, for the range of climate variability and trends at different scales in space and time, for impacts of short-term extreme events, and for specific, often non-linear responses of individual bio-geo-physical archives to any of the numerous aspects of 'climate'.

J	Hollander, DJ; Smith, MA				Hollander, DJ; Smith, MA			Microbially mediated carbon cycling as a control on the δ13C of sedimentary carbon in eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA):: New models for interpreting isotopic excursions in the sedimentary record	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												An isotopic study of various carbon phases in eutrophic Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) indicates that the delta C-13 composition of sedimentary organic and inorganic carbon has become more negative in response to increasing microbially mediated carbon cycling and processes associated with the intensification of seasonal and long-term eutrophication. Progressive increases in the contributions of isotopically depleted chemoautotrophic and methanotrophic biomass (reflected in the -40 to -90 parts per thousand values of hopanols and FAMES), attributed to seasonal and long-term increases in production and expansion of the anaerobic water mass. accounts for carbon isotopic trends towards depleted delta C-13 values observed in both seasonal varves and over the past 100 years. Changes in the intensities of certain microbial processes are also evident in the sedimentary geochemical record. During the period of most intense cultural eutrophication, when the oxic-anoxic interface was located close to the surface, methanogenesis/methanotrophy and the oxidation of biogenic methane increased to the extent that significant quantities of C-13-depleted CO2 were added into the epilimnion. This depleted CO2 was subsequently utilized by phytoplankton and incorporated into CaCO3 during biogenically induced calcite precipitation. A comparative study between eutrophic Lakes Mendota and Greifen, further indicate that the extent of nutrient loading in the epilimnion determines whether the delta C-13 record of sedimentary organic carbon reflects intensification of microbial processes in the hypolimnion and sediments, or changes in the primary productivity in the photic zone. From this comparison, a series of eutrophication models are developed to describe progressive transitions through thresholds of microbial and eukaryotic productivity and their influence on the delta C-13 record of sedimentary carbon. With increasing eutrophication, the models initially predict a negative and then a subsequent positive carbon isotopic excursion reflecting the changing influence of C-13-deleted microbial biomass relative to C-13-enriched photoautrophic biomass. These eutrophication models provide a framework to evaluate carbon cycling processes in modem environments and have significant implications for interpreting carbon isotopic excursions in the sedimentary record.

Synchronous variation of dissolved organic carbon in Adirondack lakes at multiple timescales	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key component of aquatic ecosystems with complex effects on ecosystem function. While long-term increases in DOC termed "brownification" have received considerable attention, directional trends typically account for a minority of variance. DOC concentrations also fluctuate on seasonal to multiannual timescales, but the causes of such variations are less understood. We used a wavelet-based approach to study timescale-specific, spatially synchronous fluctuations in DOC across 49 lakes in the Adirondacks, New York, USA. DOC varies synchronously among lakes at within-season, annual, and interannual timescales, but relationships with external drivers and internal processes indicated by lake chemistry differed across timescales. External drivers explained 78% of spatial DOC synchrony at the annual time scale. Beyond positive trends related to regional recovery from acidification, variability in DOC is a consequence of fluctuations at several timescales that are common among Adirondack lakes in precipitation, solar radiation, and internal chemical concentrations.					; Coombs, Nat/KCX-9443-2024	Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; Walter, Jonathan/0000-0003-2983-751X; 														2378-2242				AUG	2023	8	4					649	656		10.1002/lol2.10328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10328		APR 2023											WOS:000974888200001
J	Jusik, S; Maciol, A				Jusik, Szymon; Maciol, Aurelia			The influence of hydromorphological modifications of the littoral zone in lakes on macrophytes	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The study aimed at determining the influence of hydromorphological modifications of the littoral zone in lakes on the occurrence and quantitative diversity of macrophytes. The field research was carried out at the peak of the growing season (June - September) between 2006 and 2009. Altogether, 457 transects were studied, located in 5 lakes. Studies on the hydromorphology were performed with the method of Lake Habitat Survey (LHS), and on macrophytes - with the method of transects. The studied sites were divided into 3 groups of different intensity of morphological transformations. The identified groups constituted the starting point for the analysis of influence exerted by transformations on macrophytes. The obtained results indicate that hydromorphological modifications of lakes are an important ecological factor affecting the occurrence and quantitative diversity of macrophytes. The transformations recorded in the studied reservoirs resulted mostly from recreational exploitation. They were responsible for mechanical elimination of dominant species, which led to an increased number of taxa, synanthropization and an average level of hemeroby as well as a decrease in the total vegetation cover. Helophytes were the most negatively affected group by the transformations, which reduce their contribution in the vegetation cover, whereas macroscopic filamentous algae and elodeids were positively affected.

The response of a jack pine forest to late-Holocene climate variability in northwestern Wisconsin	HOLOCENE												Terrestrial plant communities have the potential to respond to climate change rapidly, if dominant species are killed by a series of extreme events, or slowly, if the cumulative effects of shorter-term climate fluctuations result in longR term compositional change. We used pollen and charcoal records from a lake and a testate amoebae-derived history of water-table depth in a nearby peatland to assess the response of the jack pine-dominated forests of northwestern Wisconsin to the climate variability of the last similar to 2000 years. The hydrology record and the charcoal record indicate that the climate near Warner Lake over the last similar to 2000 years was characterized by multidecadal variation in moisture availability with no apparent multicentennial-long trends in moisture balance or fire frequency. However, the pollen record suggests that there were multicentennial-scale changes in the vegetation composition around Warner Lake. Direct comparison of the three proxy records is challenging, because of their differing temporal resolutions and the complexity of potential ecological responses to climate variability. Therefore, we developed an interpretive model to compare multiple simulated proxies under two scenarios of environmental variability in order to determine under what conditions apparently contradictory records are likely to be found. The interpretive model reveals that a record of multicentennial-long change in vegetation is possible if multidecadal climate variability interacts with ecological processes influencing the direction and magnitude of succession. Compositional changes in the Warner Lake pollen record could reflect longR term variation in temperature, seasonality or other climate factors independent of moisture balance; however it is also possible that multidecadal moisture variability interacted with ecological processes affecting recruitment and mortality of species following fires of varying size and severity. Decadal-scale climatic variability can lead to altered successional pathways and to changes in forest composition that last for centuries.

We caught and fitted 17 adult Ospreys with solar-powered GPS-enhanced satellite transmitters in northeast Germany and tracked them for up to 7 years. There was a high variation in home range size depending on sex, nesting site and breeding success. The home ranges of successfully breeding males (median 33.4 km(2), 95% kernel density estimations) were significantly larger than those of females (median 4.6 km(2)) and varied in extent and shape between individuals. Some females made long excursions and sometimes spent the night at great distances to their nests after the juveniles had fledged but they also returned to the nesting area before they left for migration. The males' home range areas were consistent during the breeding period. The proportion of water surfaces on the home range areas of males ranged between 9.6 and 29%. The overnight roosts were found in distances up to 7.83 km (median 980 m) for successfully breeding males and up to 105 km (median 568 m) for successfully breeding females. The correlation between overnight roost-nest distance and the corresponding home range area was significant for females but not for males. The overlap in the home ranges of individual males that occupied the same nests in different years varied between 37.3 and 54.7% of the mutual home ranges. Males partly included the same waterbodies in their home ranges, but they also visited different lakes. In the incubation and nestling phases, females are closely bound to the nest, whereas their mates can range over vast areas.					; Meyburg, Bernd/F-9962-2016	van Wijk, Rien E./0000-0002-6887-3153; Meyburg, Bernd/0000-0003-1673-4650													2193-7192	2193-7206				OCT	2023	164	4					765	776		10.1007/s10336-023-02069-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-023-02069-5		APR 2023											WOS:000971379600001

Nonparametric Mann-Kendall tests and seasonal trend analyses indicated that there were no long-term annual increasing or decreasing trends in major trophic parameters over 8 years, but the monsoon seasonality was evident. Seasonality in chlorophyll (CHL) and total phosphorus (TP) showed a mono-modal pattern, which was closely associated with the monsoon season of July-August, and the magnitude of the mono-modal peak was greater in the headwater zone than in the downlake zone. Such temporal patterns fluctuated interannually over the study period, and the magnitude of the variation was directly controlled by the intensity of the monsoon rain. Empirical models of annual mean CHL-TP were developed supporting the view that phytoplankton in lentic ecosystems responds to P enrichment and that annual mean TP may provide a reliable basis for predicting the average algal abundance. Ambient nutrient analyses, N:P ratios and in situ nutrient enrichment bioassay experiments (NEBs) in premonsoon and postmonsoon supported the P limitation for phytoplankton growth. Ambient nutrients and non-volatile suspended solid (NVSS) data on CHL in the intense monsoon year, however, showed the possibility of light limitation, even though the NEBs did not show the direct evidence. These findings were confirmed by two-dimensional graphic approaches of trophic state index deviations (TSIDs).

Glenn			Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Fish Assemblages Following an Artificially Extended Floodplain Inundation Event, Northern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Water extraction from dryland rivers is often associated with declines in the health of river and floodplain ecosystems due to reduced flooding frequency and extent of floodplain inundation. Following moderate flooding in early 2008 in the Narran River, Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, 10,423 ML of water was purchased from agricultural water users and delivered to the river to prolong inundation of its terminal lake system to improve the recruitment success of colonial waterbirds that had started breeding in response to the initial flooding. This study examined the spatial and temporal patterns of fish assemblages in river and floodplain habitats over eight months following flooding to assess the possible ecological benefits of flood extension. Although the abundances of most fish species were greater in river channel habitats, the fish assemblage used floodplain habitats when inundated. Young-of-the-year (4-12 months age) golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and bony bream (Nematalosa erebi) were consistently sampled in floodplain sites when inundated, suggesting that the floodplain provides rearing habitat for these species. Significant differences in the abundances of fish populations between reaches upstream and downstream of a weir in the main river channel indicates that the effectiveness of the environmental water release was limited by restricted connectivity within the broader catchment. Although the seasonal timing of flood extension may have coincided with sub-optimal primary production, the use of the environmental water purchase is likely to have promoted recruitment of fish populations by providing greater access to floodplain nursery habitats, thereby improving the ability to persist during years of little or no flow.

Using a phytoplankton-grazer model parameterized for Daphnia pulex with either flexible or fixed algal carbon:nutrient stoichiometry, we explored how nutrient and light supply (the latter by varying depth of the mixed water column) affect the transient dynamics of the system starting from low densities. The system goes through an initial oscillation across nearly the entire light nutrient supply space. With flexible (but not with fixed) algal stoichiometry, duration of the initial algal peak, timing and duration of the subsequent grazer peak, and timing of the algal minimum are consistently accelerated by nutrient enrichment but decelerated by light enrichment (decreasing mixing depth) over the range of intermediate to shallow mixing depths. These contrasting effects of nutrient vs. light enrichment are consequences of their opposing influences on food quality (algal nutrient content): algal productivity and food quality are positively related along a nutrient gradient but inversely related along a light gradient. Light enrichment therefore slows down grazer growth relative to algal growth, decelerating oscillatory dynamics; nutrient enrichment has opposite effects. We manipulated nutrient supply and mixing depth in a field enclosure experiment. The experimental results were qualitatively much more consistent with the flexible than with the fixed stoichiometry model. Nutrient enrichment increased Daphnia peak biomass, decreased algal minimum biomass, decreased the seston C:P ratio, and accelerated transient oscillatory dynamics. Light enrichment (decreasing mixing depth) produced the opposite patterns, except that Daphnia peak biomass increased monotonously with light enrichment, too. Thus, while the model predicts the possibility of the "paradox of energy enrichment" (a decrease in grazer biomass with light enrichment) at high light and low nutrient supply, this phenomenon did not occur in our experiment.

Microcystins were detected mainly in blood (3.99% of injected dose at 1 h), liver (1.60% at I h), gonad (1.49% at 3 h), and kidney (0.14% at 48 h). Other tissues, such as the heart, gill, gallbladder, intestine, spleen, brain, and muscle, contained less than 0.1% of the injected MCs. The highest concentration of MCs was found in blood (526-3,753 ng/g dry wt), followed by liver (103-1,656 ng/g dry wt) and kidney (279-1,592 ng/g dry wt). No MC-LR was detectable in intestine, spleen, kidney, brain, and muscle, whereas MC-RR was found in all examined fish tissues, which might result from organ specificity of different MCs. Clearance of MC-RR in brain tissue was slow. In kidney, the MC-RR content was negatively correlated with that in blood, suggesting that blood was important in the transportation of MC-RR to kidney for excretion.

In Lake Biwa, Japan, Micrasterias hardyi-considered an endemic species in Australia-has become one of the major dominant species since 2016. To evaluate long-term and seasonal variations in M. hardyi, we analyzed 20 years of plankton samples from the northern basin of Lake Biwa. The presence of this species was first confirmed in February 2015, and increased for long periods from November 2015 (4.2 cells cm(-2)) to December 2016 (2.3 x 10(5) cells cm(-2)) and from September 2017 (2.0 x 10(2) cells cm(-2)) to January 2019 (5.7 x 10(4) cells cm(-2)). Particles similar to chytrid zoosporangia were observed and attached to M. hardyi cells. However, the infection rate was low (up to 22.5%), and the infection did not seem to be a major lethal factor. We estimated that M. hardyi was introduced in the early 2000s by simple linear regression of abundance. This result indicates the existence of long time lag from introduction to detection. Moreover, as the propagule pressure to nearby water systems has been high, it is highly probable that M. hardyi has spread to other lakes and ponds via Lake Biwa.

These lakes are located in very distinct landscapes: coastal forest-savanna mosaic, rain forest and savanna with colonising forest, respectively. Core chronologies were established by radiocarbon dating. Study of these lacustrine archives (textural variables, clay minerals, organic matter components, delta C-13, pollen) allowed comparison of late Holocene environmental changes recorded at each site and with results from other studies. Lake Kamal,t, indicates minor climatic deterioration (increased drying and greater seasonality) between 1,410 and 500 cal. years BP, which is also recognised in southern Cameroon and east-central Africa. Lake NguSne was surrounded by dense moist forest throughout the last 4,110 years, but shows significant deterioration from 2,800 cal. years BP, a phenomenon seen at nearby sites. Lake Maridor shows a decline of forest initiated a little after 3,800 cal. years BP, which indicates timing that is distinct from the two other sites. This was probably a response to local conditions (i.e. outlet damming). Although the three lakes display generally parallel climatic trends perhaps linked to SST oscillations, there is not perfect coherence between these three sites. Differences among the three basins may be attributable to local factors like groundwater hydrology and slope instabilities of such shallow lake systems in this equatorial region.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2009	41	2					369	392		10.1007/s10933-008-9231-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9231-5													WOS:000262651500009

Lake Maggiore has been severely polluted by DDT through production of the pesticide within its catchment. Although agricultural application of DDT was banned in Italy in the 1978, industrial production continued until 1996, with enough contamination of water and soil for serious bioaccumulation in the lake biota. PCB and DDT concentrations in a whitefish (Coregonus macrophthalmus Nusslin 1882) were seen to be dependent on season and fish age, but not on sex. The average increase of the lipid-normalised concentration of DDTs and PCBs was two-fold across season and also across age, resulting in an overall increase of four fold. The seasonal variation was related to the eco-physiological cycle of the fish and to the contamination dynamic of the lake, while the effect of the fish age was explained on the base of biomagnification-related mechanisms. A fugacity model was applied to predict the age-dependent bioaccumulation potential of PCBs, whose concentrations were rather stable in recent years in the lake. Predicted values for compounds with negligible biotransformation were in good agreement with experimental data (calculated vs. experimental mean difference of 14%), and a relationship between the increase of experimental age-dependent concentration and K (ow) was observed. The good correspondence between the predicted and the measured values for most PCB congeners confirmed the general inability of fishes to biotransform these compounds. On the contrary, the importance of biotransformation processes was recognised in birds; eggs of a fish eating bird (Podiceps cristatus) from the same area selectively bioaccumulated p,p'-DDE. For PCBs, congener 149 appears to be completely metabolized by the bird species, and congeners 95, 101, 132, 151 and 174 were reduced as well. The role of the meta-para free position on at least one phenyl ring of PCB congeners in biotransformation processes was confirmed.

The bimodal rainfall regime in much of East Africa brings rainy seasons from March to May and October to December with greater interannual variability from October to December. We discuss the impacts of rainfall extremes in 1961 and 1997 and explore three examples of natural-resources management in the context of rainfall variability: inland fisheries in East and southern Africa; fluctuations in the level of Lake Victoria; and lake-shore communities around Lake Kyoga in Uganda. The discussion reflects the complexity of linkages between climate, environment and society in the region and highlights implications for natural-resources management. These range from benefits due to improved seasonal rainfall forecasting to reduce the damage of extremes, to improved understanding of existing climate-society interactions to provide insights into the region's vulnerability and adaptive capacity in relation to future climate change.

Phytoplankton response to light and internal phosphorus loading from sediment release	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A 2 x 2 factorial design was employed to look at the influence of two levels of phosphorus (P; high and low) and two levels of light (high and low) and their interactions, on phytoplankton abundance, elemental tissue composition and community structure in two seasons (April and June) of 2005. 2. A novel feature of the experiment was the creation of high and low P levels by manipulating sediment core conditions in the laboratory. Sediment cores were incubated with their associated overlaying water column from four different sites in Mona Lake, Michigan, under anaerobic or aerobic conditions, respectively. 3. After 24 days, the water overlaying the sediment cores was collected and used as growth media for phytoplankton collected from Mona Lake. Phytoplankton communities were grown in the laboratory in the high or low P water, and subjected to high (250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) or low (10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) light for 9 (April) or 14 (June) days. 4. In the April experiment, high P treatments resulted in significantly higher chlorophyll-a concentrations, significantly lower C : P ratios from two of the four sites, and greater dominance by Scenedesmus at all sites relative to low P treatments. High light generally led to higher chlorophyll-a concentrations, higher C : P ratios and greater Scenedesmus and Fragilaria biovolume at all sites. A significant interaction was measured between P and light for chlorophyll-a and Scenedesmus biovolume, suggesting the influence of P was more apparent at high light than at low light levels. 5. In the June experiment, high P increased ash-free dry mass (AFDM), lowered C : P ratios and resulted in increased Pediastrum biovolume. High light levels led to greater chlorophyll-a concentrations, AFDM and C : P ratios, as well as increased biovolumes of Scendesmus, Pediastrum and Fragilaria. A significant interaction was found between P and light for all three taxa, as the positive influence of P was more pronounced at high light levels. 6. The results of our study demonstrate that sediment-derived P stimulates phytoplankton growth, but that its effect on phytoplankton dynamics is modulated by other factors, such as light.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2008	53	12					2530	2542		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02079.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02079.x													WOS:000260670100016

It is assumed that the appearance of such morphotypes is favored by selective predation of bacterivorous protists and that filter-feeding zooplankton plays a major role in suppressing these bacteria. The pbylogenetic affiliation of the important bloom-forming filamentous bacteria in freshwaters is presently unknown. Here we report the identification of dominant members of a filamentous bacterial assemblage during a bloom of such morphotypes in a mesotrophic lake. By molecular cloning and fluorescence in situ hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes, up to 98% of filamentous cells in lake water could be assigned to a clade of almost identical (99% similarity) 16S rRNA gene sequence types, the cosmopolitan freshwater LD2 cluster. For a period of less than 1 week, members of the LD2 clade constituted >40% of the total bacterial biomass, potentially favored by high grazing of planktivorous protists. This is probably the most pronounced case of dominance by a single bacterioplankton species ever observed in natural freshwaters. In enclosures artificially stocked with the metazoan filter feeder Daphnia, bacteria related to the LD2 clade formed a significantly larger fraction of filaments than in enclosures where Daphnia had been removed. However, in the presence of higher numbers of Daphnia individuals, the LD2 bacteria, like other filaments, were eventually eliminated both in enclosures and in the lake. This points at the potential importance of filter-feeding zooplankton in controlling the occurrence and species composition of filamentous bacterial morphotypes in freshwater plankton.					; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Jurgens, Klaus/0000-0002-7999-9368; Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X													0099-2240	1098-5336				OCT	2004	70	10					6272	6281		10.1128/AEM.70.10.6272-6281.2004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.10.6272-6281.2004								15466575					WOS:000224356200070

Thad; Morgan, Robert			The influence of rainfall on taste and odor production in a south-central USA reservoir	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Changing rainfall patterns resulting from climate change are predicted to influence cyanobacterial blooms and associated production of toxins and other metabolites, but few studies have demonstrated this link. We explored seasonal and interannual trends in 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) concentrations and the correlation of these data with rainfall and hydrologic data from 2000 to 2013. We also conducted a detailed study of cyanobacterial abundances and MIB during 2 hydrologically extreme years, a prolonged drought in 2007 followed by an extremely wet year in 2008. The goal was to assess whether cyanobacterial abundances and explanatory variables that are often correlated with cyanobacterial abundances were useful predictors of MIB concentration. From 2000 to 2013, mean annual rainfall was negatively related to mean annual MIB (r = -0.50, p = 0.08) and explained 25% of the variation in MIB. In 2007, MIB and cyanobacterial abundance were high, whereas in 2008, MIB and cyanobacterial abundance were low. The total N : total P (TN : TP) mass ratio was strongly related to MIB concentration during the drought and explained 44% of the variation in MIB concentration (r = -0.66, p = 0.003). Our results suggest that rainfall and the TN: TP mass ratio may be useful predictors for MIB in drinking-water reservoirs.					; Hausmann, Sonja/E-5152-2011; Scott, Thad/AAF-7151-2020	Hausmann, Sonja/0000-0002-5411-5298; Scott, Thad/0000-0002-9487-9698; 													2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2014	33	3					755	764		10.1086/677176	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/677176													WOS:000340580700007

The population of LCT in Pyramid Lake, Nevada has returned from the brink of extirpation, and although it is highly managed via stocking, the population is thriving and has recently started to reproduce naturally. Our objectives were to determine (1) whether predator and prey remain tightly coupled, (2) whether LCT are food limited, and (3) the status of the LCT population with regard to the potential prey-based contemporary carrying capacity. We used a multifaceted approach, including intensive field sampling of fish, bioenergetics modeling, cohort reconstruction, and comparisons of prey availability to consumption. We estimated that the average population of LCT in Pyramid Lake is 1.2 million, average annual stocking is 650,000, and the number of fish angled ranges from 5,000 to 14,000 per year, with a 90% release rate. Driven by seasonal and size variation in consumption, individual annual consumption by LCT varied from 667 to 992 g/year for small LCT (200-400 mm TL) and from 2,388 to 3,057 g/year for large LCT (>400 mm TL). Lahontan Cutthroat Trout are consuming, on average, 14-63% of the standing crop of Tui Chub Siphateles bicolor annually, indicating that LCT are currently not exceeding their prey-based carrying capacity. The LCT in Pyramid Lake remain tightly coupled to their primary native prey, Tui Chub, despite considerable changes to the ecosystem; therefore, managing for a robust population of LCT translates largely to managing for forage fish. This supply-versus-demand issue is of particular concern for Pyramid Lake given that the density of Tui Chub may be declining concordant with declining lake elevation. Given the conservation importance of this LCT population, careful monitoring is critical; however, "predation inertia" indicates that effective short-term management in response to fluctuations in forage fishes is likely possible.

Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) dominated in both air and rain water, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) related substances showed a higher affinity to dust. Relatively high concentrations of DDT and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) in air, rain and dust imply that technical DDT in the environment has been degrading, and there may be unknown local or regional emission sources that contain DDTs in the study area. Source identification showed that DDTs in Beijing urban environments with a fresh signature may originate from the atmospheric transport from remote areas. The ratio of alpha-/gamma-HCH in dust, rain, canopy throughfall and runoff were close to 1, indicating the possible use of lindane. OCPs in runoff were transported from various sources including rain, dust, and canopy throughfall. In runoff, DDTs and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were mainly transported from dust, and HCHs were mainly from rain and canopy throughfall.

Palaeolimnology as a tool to inform shallow lake management: an example from Upton Great Broad, Norfolk, UK	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION					7th INTECOL International Wetland Conference	JUL 25-30, 2004	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS	Utrecht Univ, Landscape Ecol Grp, Int & Natl Sci Comm				This palaeolimnological study investigates recent changes in the biological structure of an English shallow lake (Upton Great Broad, Norfolk). By focusing on the historical occurrence of submerged macrophytes, particularly the rare UK species, Najas marina L. (Holly-leaved Naiad), we address a management question that frequently arises for shallow lakes, namely whether to undertake sediment removal to increase water depth and/or restore conservation value. Macro-remains of aquatic macrophytes and molluscs were analysed in two littoral sediment cores and combined with other historical ecological data covering the last 100 years. Before around 1900, the lake had Chara meadows (including at least three species) and an associated species-rich community of Mollusca. Between around 1900-1970 a period of high angiosperm diversity is suggested with a reduction of Characeae and the development of patches of water-lily (particularly Nymphaea alba L.) and fen swamp in the open water. Then, after around 1970, our data indicate a rapid shift towards Najas-dominance coupled with a decrease in the seasonal length of the plant-covered period. The expansion of Najas was clearly associated with, and may even be dependent upon, a highly unusual fluid, green sediment formation that developed at the site from around the same time. Thus, despite the loss of an earlier more diverse vegetation and associated fauna, we suggest that best practice conservation may be allow natural site development and not to undertake active management such as sediment removal which might threaten the status of Najas. Our conclusion could only have been arrived at through the long-term ecological perspective that a palaeolimnological approach provides.																			0960-3115					AUG	2008	17	9					2153	2168		10.1007/s10531-007-9223-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-007-9223-1													WOS:000257486400007

We tested whether filter-feeding baicaliids and valvatids consume and assimilate different food using data from gut contents, stable delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopes and radular morphology, with subsequent combined analyses. Our results showed that the four baicaliid species assimilate microalgae, diatoms and bacteria, whereas the single Megalovalvata species mostly assimilates plant detritus. The delta(15) variations in the baicaliids reflect differences in their digestion of seston components, whereas the delta C-13 similarity illustrates consumption of food particles derived from similar primary producers. Gut contents in the baicaliids were dominated by a single species of planktonic diatom, although more than 30 species of microalgae were recorded in all seasons. However, the composition and quantity of additional food particles varied by species. Our results showed that baicaliids have significant fine scale differences in radular tooth morphology, which may allow partitioning of food resources.					; Sitnikova, Tatiana/JBR-8697-2023; Maximova, Natalia/J-3345-2018	Sitnikova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3278-6111; Maximova, Natalia/0000-0003-4342-5028													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2012	682	1					75	90		10.1007/s10750-011-0685-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0685-5													WOS:000299925600006

Temperature and oxygen responses of single solute fluxes are well known; however, not much is known about the interaction of temperature and oxygen in regulating the balance of different fluxes in the benthic environment. We analyzed benthic flux (mobilization and immobilization) data of various solutes (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CH4, NO3--N, NH4+-N, SRP, SO4-, Fe, Mn, and O-2) collected from laboratory incubations of 142 sediment cores from 5 different reservoirs incubated under varying in situ temperature and oxygen conditions. Oxygen was the primary driver of benthic fluxes, while temperature and total organic content were secondary. Temperature effects on benthic fluxes were stronger under anoxic conditions which imply that warming will substantially increase the benthic fluxes if the sediment surface becomes anoxic. The varying temperature response of processes underlying the studied fluxes will result in a shift of their relative importance in the benthic environment, especially in shallow lakes that are more vulnerable to warming. For example, more anoxic conditions will shift the equilibrium between net sulfate reduction and methane release toward the latter. We also predict that physical effects of warming leading to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, that is, stronger stratification and longer hypolimnetic confinement will increase the benthic mobilization of phosphorus, DOC, and methane into water and immobilization of sulfate by the sediments even in deep lakes.

Poyang Lake is the largest floodplain wetland in China and naturally connected with the Yangtze River and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) upstream. To understand the potential impacts of TGD on Poyang Lake wetlands, we collected remote sensing imagery acquired during dry season from 1987 to 2020 and extracted vegetation coverage data in the Ganjiang Northern-branch Delta (GND) and the Ganjiang Southern-branch Delta (GSD), using the Object-oriented Artificial Neural Network Regression. Principal components analysis, correlation analysis, and the random forest model were used to explore the interactions between vegetation extent in the two deltas and 33 hydrological variables regarding magnitude, duration, timing, and variation. The implementation of the TGD advanced and extended the low-flow periods in Poyang Lake. Vegetation coverage in the GND and GSD increased at the rates of 0.39 and 0.22 km(2)/year, respectively. The reservoir storage at the end of September accelerated the runoff recession in the GND and the GSD, making low-flow events more influential for vegetation dynamics and shortening the response time of vegetation to the water regime. This study provides an important reference for evaluating the impacts of dam engineering on downstream wetlands.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				APR	2023	33	4					885	904		10.1007/s11442-023-2111-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-023-2111-0													WOS:000983403000009

Several studies were conducted, including laboratory tests, ecological simulations, and a field investigation of Poyang Lake. The laboratory studies showed that Fe3+, Cu2+, and Pb2+ stimulated MC photodegradation under high light intensity at the water sediment interface, which reduced the MC accumulation in the sediment. In the laboratory studies involving the addition of metal ions to lake sediment containing adsorbed MC, MC biodegradation was inhibited by supplementing with high levels of Fe3+, Cu2+, or Pb2+. Fe3+ and Pb2+ promoted MC accumulation in the hydrophyte Eichhornia crassipes at relatively low concentrations, but this effect decreased with increasing high metal concentrations. An ecological survey in Poyang Lake during the dry season demonstrated that high Fe levels can reduce MC accumulation in the sediment, which could be the result of Fe-mediated photodegradation. The results indicate that metals involved in MC transportation and degradation may play an important role in the environmental fate of MC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Jake			The effects of experimental whole-lake mixing on horizontal spatial patterns of fish and Zooplankton	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We examined horizontal spatial patterns of fish densities and zooplankton biomass at a fine spatial scale of 50 m across seasons before, during, and after an experimental lake destratification to determine how interacting trophic levels may respond to alteration of thermal stratification. We used semivariogram analysis to calculate maximum distances of autocorrelation for fish and zooplankton separately, and cross variograms to determine whether relationships between fish and zooplankton are positive or negative. Fish became more dispersed during the manipulation, likely due to a flight response with the loss of preferred cold water habitat. There were no changes in zooplankton horizontal distributions with mixing, but we detected seasonal trends in distribution and biomass. We detected positive relationships between fish densities and zooplankton biomass for portions of the year, but did not detect any negative relationships. There was no effect of lake mixing on spatial interactions between fish and zooplankton. Our results indicate that external factors, such as seasonal wind patterns, may drive whole-lake zooplankton distributions, and that fish respond horizontally to change in vertically structured processes, especially when reliant on depth-dependent variables such as cold water.

Climate change and related rising water temperatures are suspected to affect macrophyte growth and species composition as well as the length of the growing season. Alternative to the traditional ground-based monitoring methods, remote sensing is expected to provide fast and effective tools to map submerged macrophytes at short intervals and over large areas. This study analyses interrelations between spectral signature, plant phenology and the length of growing season as influenced by the variable water temperature. During the growing seasons of 2011 and 2015, remote sensing reflectance spectra of macrophytes and sediment were collected systematically in-situ with hyperspectral underwater spectroradiometer at Lake Starnberg, Germany. The established spectral libraries were used to develop reflectance models. The combination of spectral information and phenologic characteristics allows the development of a phenologic fingerprint for each macrophyte species. By inversion, the reflectance models deliver day and daytime specific spectral signatures of the macrophyte populations. The subsequent classification processing chain allowed distinguishing species-specific macrophyte growth at different phenologic stages. The analysis of spectral signatures within the phenologic development indicates that the invasive species Elodea nuttallii is less affected by water temperature oscillations than the native species Chara spp. and Potamogeton perfoliatus.					; Geist, Juergen/C-4933-2008	Schneider, Thomas/0000-0003-1126-2818; Geist, Juergen/0000-0001-7698-3443														2073-4441				JUL	2017	9	7							527	10.3390/w9070527	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9070527													WOS:000406681700078

The Role of Invasive Amphipod Gmelonoides fasciatus (Stebbing) in the Feeding of Perch Perca fluviatilis L. in the Littoral Zone of Lake Onega	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The successful invasion of the Baikalian amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus in the littoral zone of Lake Onega changed significantly the structure of the food resources of fish. High abundance and biomass of these amphipods in macrozoobenthos are the reasons why one of the mass species of littoral fish, perch Perca fluviatilis, turned to active feeding on these crustaceans. In some lake shallow water habitats, the share of this amphipod in the weight of stomach content and occurrence frequency are not less than 50%. Active spread of the amphipod and the dynamics of population indices of this invasive species in Lake Onega indicate the necessity for further studies on the role that G. fasciatus plays in the diet of littoral fish species in the seasonal aspect.					; Georgiev, Andrew/AAE-2391-2020; Sidorova, Anastasiiy/AAD-4548-2022	Sidorova, Anastasia/0000-0002-3466-4062; 													2075-1117	2075-1125				JUL	2017	8	3					261	265		10.1134/S2075111717030092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S2075111717030092													WOS:000457635800009

M.; Joseph, Sabu; Petitta, Marco; Thomas, Jobin			Integrated approach for identifying the factors controlling groundwater quality of a tropical coastal zone in Kerala, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study examined the factors controlling shallow groundwater quality in two coastal panchayaths (viz., Chennam-Pallippuram and Thykkattussery) of Alappuzha district, Kerala, India, for three sampling seasons: pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon. The hydrochemical analysis shows significant seasonal fluctuations in groundwater quality, which are principally controlled by the climatic seasonality, contributed by the monsoon phenomenon. The groundwater is highly polluted due to organic load, which is manifested as high total and fecal coliform (TC and FC) contents, especially during MON. Fresh water recharge during MON contributes Ca-Mg-HCO3 type waters, whereas Ca-Mg-Cl and mixed cations-Cl types during PRM imply interaction between groundwater and saline/brackish water of the lake surrounding the study area. Such interaction is also evident by various ionic ratios (e.g., Mg2+/Ca2+, Na+/Cl-) as well as the correlation between Cl- and SO42-. The Ca2+ + Mg2+ versus TZ(+) relationship indicates significance of weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals as well as interaction between groundwater and aquifer matrix, which is also supported by the positive chloro-alkaline indices. Isotopic composition of the groundwater and lake water also suggests the influence of fresh water recharge (mainly during monsoon) as well as interaction of groundwater with lake water in controlling groundwater quality. Factor analysis proposes three dominant processes controlling groundwater quality of the region: (1) interaction of groundwater with brackish water of the Vembanad Lake, (2) geogenic/atmospheric sources, such as weathering, groundwater interaction with aquifer matrix, atmospheric inputs and fresh water recharge and (3) diverse anthropogenic sources of contamination (e.g., domestic waste, septic tanks, and agricultural residues). However, relative influence of these factors on groundwater quality varies temporally to form groundwater with differing chemical composition among the seasons. The present study underscores the exigency to ensure availability of safe drinking water for the coastal zones.

Here we present two new pollen sequences obtained from this area, and a new palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the region. The available pollen data reach back to before 18,000 B.P., a period of very harsh climate with seasonal (non continuous) sedimentation and a landscape characterised by herbaceous formations dominated by Gramineae and Artemisia, and scrub formations dominated by Ericaceae and Cistaceae. Subsequently sedimentation became continuous, and various regional forest expansions are apparent. At a local level, the first forest expansion began about 12,000 B.P., when Betula pollen reached 70% followed by peaks in Pinus sylvestris-type (>80%) and Quercus robur-type (40%). The Younger Dryas saw a retreat of woodland formations in the area around the lake, with broadleaved deciduous woodland (largely oak) retreating at mid and low altitudes, but with pine woodland persisting in more sheltered sites. The climatic improvement in the Early Holocene favoured re-expansion of woodland, dominated by Pinus sylvestris-type at higher and Quercus robur and Q. pyrenaica at lower altitudes, until anthropogenic deforestation commenced around 4,000 B.P. The disappearance of natural pine woodlands in this region is probably largely attributable to human interference.					; Rego, Pablo/Q-9353-2018; Munoz Sobrino, Castor/H-2948-2015; Sobrino, Castor/N-6281-2019	Ramil Rego, Pablo/0000-0001-6415-8630; Munoz Sobrino, Castor/0000-0001-8191-3001; 													0939-6314	1617-6278				MAR	2004	13	1					1	22		10.1007/s00334-003-0028-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-003-0028-1													WOS:000220088300001

During the study period, mean CO2 fluxes was 488.63 +/- 1,036.17 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1). The flux rate was high compared to those of lakes in other regions, and represented a "hotspot" of CO2 evasion. Temporal variation of CO2 flux was significant, with the peak value in the beginning and lowest point in the end of warm season. High concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lake water (WDOC) was found to highly correlated to CO2 flux (R = 0.47, P < 0.01, n = 54). Besides, fluorescence index of WDOC showed its terrestrial origin character. In accordance with lakes in northern and boreal regions, terrestrial DOC concentration in water column was the most important regulator of CO2 flux from this lake. We suggest that large area of peatlands in catchments support high concentration of DOC in this lake, and consequently high CO2 evasion.

J	Van Metre, PC; Horowitz, AJ				Van Metre, Peter C.; Horowitz, Arthur J.			An 80-year record of sediment quality in the lower Mississippi River	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												In 1937, the US Army Corps of Engineers cut through the neck of a large meander on the lower Mississippi River (below the confluence with the Ohio River) forming the Caulk Neck cutoff and creating Lake Whittington, a 26-km long oxbow lake, in northern Mississippi. Since 1938, seasonal flooding and a boat channel connecting the lake with the Mississippi River have led to sediment accumulation in the lake, resulting in an 80-year record of sediment quality in the river. On the basis of an age-dated sediment core from the lake, trends in trace metals and hydrophobic organic compounds (except polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) follow well-known patterns with upward trends from the 1930s to the ca 1970s, followed by downward trends to the present. Two factors contribute to these patterns: reservoir construction and changes in emissions. The construction of seven large reservoirs on the Missouri River, in particular the closure of the Fort Randall (1953) and Gavins Point (1955) Dams, greatly reduced the load of relatively clean sediment to the Mississippi River, likely contributing to downstream increases in contaminant concentrations in the Mississippi River. Increasing anthropogenic emissions also contributed to upward trends until ca 1970 when major environmental policy actions began resulting in broad decreases in emissions and downward trends in the concentrations of most of the contaminants monitored. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phosphorus are partial exceptions to this pattern, with increases to the 1960s and variable concentrations showing no clear trend since. Published 2012.

To provide a first record of the taxa composition and diversity of zooplankton communities, we sampled 15 reservoirs during 2008-2009, from the north of the island to the south, representative of a range of size, depth, renewal time, and trophy. The survey was complemented by seasonal sampling in one of the largest lakes studied. Water samples collected from surface to bottom provided data on hydrochemistry and trophy. Crustacean dormant stages were inspected from sediments of the richest, and most diverse, Lake Sos Canales. RDA suggested that productivity, water depth, renewal time and altitude were the main variables related to taxa composition. The ubiquitous Copidodiaptomus numidicus, and its persistence in the water column, resulted from the production of subitaneous eggs throughout the year, an adaptive strategy in perennial water bodies. Genetic analyses of DNA sequences of the diagnostic gene ND5 placed the Sardinian Daphnia pulex in the North American group. Moreover, the ND5 sequence found in Sardinia was identical with that of an asexual hybrid clone between the American D. pulex and American D. pulicaria that replaced native D. pulex throughout Africa. The presence of this ND5 haplotype in Sardinia shows that this invasive clone also poses an invasive threat to native populations in Europe.

Crust formation, mechanical disturbance, soil texture, moisture, and chemical content of the soil can affect the amount of dust emitted during a wind event. A refined method of quantifying windblown dust emissions was applied at Mono Lake, CA, to account for changing surface conditions. This method used a combination of real-time sand flux monitoring, ambient PM(10) monitoring, and dispersion modeling to estimate dust emissions and their downwind impact. The method identified periods with high emissions and periods when the surface was stable (no sand flux), even though winds may have been high. A network of 25 Cox sand catchers (CSCs) was used to measure the mass of saltating particles to estimate sand flux rates across a 2-km(2) area. Two electronic sensors (Sensits) were used to time-resolve the CSC sand mass to estimate hourly sand flux rates, and a perimeter tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) monitor measured hourly PM(10) concentrations. Hourly sand flux rates were related by dispersion modeling to hourly PM(10) concentrations to back-calculate the ratio of vertical PM(10) flux to horizontal sand flux (K-factors). Geometric mean K-factor values (K(f)) were found to change seasonally, ranging from 1.3 x 10(-5) to 5.1 x 10(-5) for sand flux measured at 15 cm above the surface (q(15)). Hourly PM(10) emissions, F, were calculated by applying seasonal K-factors to sand flux measurements (F = K(f) x q(15)). The maximum hourly PM10 emission rate from the study area was 76 g/m(2).hr (10-m wind speed = 23.5 m/sec). Maximum daily PM(10) emissions were estimated at 450 g/m(2).day, and annual emissions at. 1095 g/m(2).yr. Hourly PM(10) emissions were used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guideline AERMOD dispersion model to estimate downwind ambient impacts. Model predictions compared well with monitor concentrations, with hourly PM(10) ranging from 16 to over 60,000 mu g/m(3) (slope = 0.89, R(2) = 0.77).																			1047-3289					OCT	2011	61	10					1036	1045		10.1080/10473289.2011.596760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10473289.2011.596760								22070036					WOS:000295910200006
J	Moretti, E; Wickings, K; Nault, B				Moretti, Erica; Wickings, Kyle; Nault, Brian			Environmental factors and crop management that affect Delia antiqua damage in onion fields	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Many factors directly and indirectly influence pest dynamics in cultivated crops and identifying the suite of factors associated with a pest's population dynamics is an important component of pest management. Onion maggot, Delia antiqua (Meigen) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), is a significant pest of onion in temperature regions worldwide. In the Great Lakes region of North America, D. antiqua is the most important early-season pest of onion and causes considerable damage by killing plants. Despite growers employing the same management and cultivation practices, plant damage by D. antiqua across the region is highly variable. The commonality of production and management suggests that other factors may be important in explaining the disparities in damage across the region, and previous studies have indicated that temperature and precipitation, soil organic matter, surrounding landscape composition, planting date, and plant size at peak fly activity are all important factors affecting D. antiqua. In a two-year study (2018-19), the aforementioned factors were monitored in commercial onion fields (2018: n = 15; 2019: n = 13) in central and western New York, USA. Fly activity was positively associated with plant damage in both years of the study. Onion fields surrounded primarily by forest rather than agricultural crops and those planted late rather than early in the season had higher levels of damage by D. antiqua. Plant damage also was negatively associated with soil temperature and positively associated with soil organic matter content, but these effects were context dependent and were only observed in the first year of the study. These results will be used to inform management decisions by growers and have important implications for the development of predictive models for D. antiqua infestations.

Three units are distinguished. The lowermost and the uppermost units reflect an alluvial environment, whereas the middle one represents lacustrine facies. The lower alluvial unit is interpreted as a record of ephemeral, sinuous, suspended-load channels with rapid vertical accretion. Channel barforms are lacking. The environments is interpreted as a low-energy anastomosing fluvial system. The clayey middle unit is interpreted as having formed in a wide long-lived lake. The top of the lacustrine deposits shows signs of vertisol-type pedogenesis, most probably under subtropical conditions, with seasonally-induced wet and dry intervals. The upper unit reflects a low-energy means-higher than that of the earlier one, which is interpreted as an effect of base-level lowering in combination with an increasingly humid climate. The almost exclusively silty/clayey alluvial deposits represent an exceptionally rare facies. The drainage basin must have been an extremely flat lowland. The presence of vertebrate bones within the anastomosing and mcandering river deposits indicates that low-energy alluvial plains were apparently favourable habitats for both reptiles and amphibians during the Late Triassic: under the subtropical seasonally dry conditions the animals must have preferred moist areas, i.e. the flood basins and abandoned channels on the flat valley floors.					; Gruszka, Beata/F-7962-2011; Zielinski, Tomasz/B-1569-2008	Zielinski, Tomasz/0000-0001-9018-0276; Gruszka, Beata/0000-0002-1021-4075													1641-7291	2082-5099					2008	52	3					239	252																WOS:000259982200004

Seasonal changes in the zooplankton abundances of the reservoir Valle de Bravo (State of Mexico, Mexico)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Valle de Bravo is one of largest drinking water reservoirs in Mexico, serving nearly 12% of Mexico City's population of 26 million. We studied the monthly variations in the zooplankton density and diversity for one year (November 2004 to October 2005) at five different depths (2, 4, 8, 12, and 20 m) at each of the five sites of the reservoir. The water body was generally alkaline; pH decreased with increasing depth. Dissolved oxygen also decreased drastically with depth, from an average of 8 mg/L to less than 1 mg/L. Chlorophyll a concentration varied considerably (2.6 +/- 0.06 to 12.5 +/- 2.8 mu g/L) both seasonally and with depth. Secchi depth averaged 1.65 m and varied between 0.63 and 3.21 m along the seasons but exhibited minimal differences among sites. Differences in zooplankton abundance and composition were small among sites, supporting the theory that anthropogenic disturbances affect the reservoir as a whole. The mean total zooplankton density was about 400 +/- 293 ind./L, mostly composed of rotifer species, particularly Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra vulgaris, and Trichocerca similis. Densities of K. cochlearis at 2-m depth exceeded 1800 ind./L during the rainy season (May-July). Average density of P. vulgaris was 200 +/- 133 ind./L, while that of T. similis was half that amount. The dominant cladoceran taxa were Bosmina longirostris, Chydorus sphaericus, and Daphnia laevis. An inverse relationship between depth and zooplankton abundance and depth and diversity was observed. In contrast, we observed a direct relation between the mean rotifer and cladoceran density. Shannon-Wiener's species diversity index ranged between 1.00 and 4.09. Fourteen of the rotifer species found are new records for Valle de Bravo and another 13 species observed earlier were not encountered in the present study. The overall trends in both the densities and dominance of rotifer species of the reservoir did not essentially change during the last five years.

The k(d) estimates are often based on empirical and semi-analytical algorithms, designed for oceanic and coastal waters. However, there is a lack of information about the performances of these models to inland waters dominated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Therefore, to contribute to this investigation, nine empirical models based on the blue-to-green and blue-to-red ratios and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration were evaluated, as well as three semi-analytical models using bands from the Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8. The errors (mean absolute percentage error, MAPE > 80%) presented by the empirical models confirmed that the blue-to-green ratio failed in retrieving k(d)(490) in an environment dominated by CDOM. Similar failures occurred with the models using the Chl-a concentration (MAPE similar to 60%) as input. A semi-analytical approach showed the lowest error (MAPE = 41.04%) in the estimate of the inherent optical properties for complex waters in order to reduce the errors above. After retrieval of k(d)(490) using the semi-analytical model, seasonal patterns were observed, and high values of k(d)(490) were detected in the dry season possibly due to the increase of the concentration of the optically-significant substances (OSS).					do Carmo, Alisson/M-9359-2019; Coelho do Carmo, Alisson Fernando/K-6561-2015; Pequeno, Thanan/AAD-8287-2019; Bernardo do Carmo, Nariane/C-3284-2015; Alcantara, Enner/H-4286-2012	Coelho do Carmo, Alisson Fernando/0000-0002-3439-1252; Rodrigues, Thanan/0000-0003-4302-4216; Campos Gomes, Ana Carolina/0000-0003-4885-0816; Alcantara, Enner/0000-0002-7777-2119; Bernardo, Nariane/0000-0002-8292-3102													2072-4292					JUL	2018	10	7							1063	10.3390/rs10071063	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10071063													WOS:000440332500086

In both the lake and riverine systems, one sediment type was high in AVS and one low in AVS, which resulted in zinc-spiked sediments that ranged from low to high SEM to AVS ratios. The colonization trays were sampled seasonally, ranging from 6 to 37 weeks of exposure, and were evaluated using several appropriate benthic indices. Results of the field evaluations at the four test sites confirmed the validity of the AVS-SEM model, predicting benthic macroinvertebrate effects correctly 92% of the time. In sediments where the SEM to AVS ratio or the AVS and organic (OC)-normalized fractions exceeded 8 and 583 mumol/g of OC, toxicity was observed from the zinc-spiked sediments. Conversely, when the SEM to AVS ratio or OC-normalized AVS fractions were less than 2 or 100 mumol/g of OC, no toxicity was observed. In the range of 148 to 154 mumol/g of OC, toxicity varied in two treatments. Total zinc concentrations in sediments showed no relationship to benthic effects. The most impaired benthic community occurred in the high-gradient stream sediments, which had low OC and AVS concentrations and SEM to AVS ratios of 33 and 44 in the spiked sediments. Five to six benthic metrics were depressed at SEM to AVS ratios of 8.32 and 9.73. The no-observed-effect level appeared to be near a SEM to AVS ratio of 2, with slight to no effects between ratios of 2.34 and 2.94. No sites with ratios of less than 2 showed any adverse effects.

J	Caceres, CE; Tessier, AJ				Caceres, CE; Tessier, AJ			How long to rest: The ecology of optimal dormancy and environmental constraint	ECOLOGY												Dormancy is a common mechanism employed by short-lived organisms for persistence in a variable environment. Theory suggests that the fraction of propagules that terminate dormancy each year should be <100% when recruitment success varies temporally. Moreover, the fraction of propagules that resumes development should vary across habitats that differ in the probability of successful recruitment or the probability of survival during dormancy. We tested these predictions by using dormant eggs from five populations of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria that differ in their ability to recruit to and persist in the water column. In two separate experiments, newly produced dormant eggs were incubated in situ for one year at various sites on the bottom of the lakes. A series of reciprocal transplants among four of these populations separated the effects of lake-specific environmental cues from the genetic and maternal effects of the different populations. Additional eggs were incubated in the laboratory under photoperiod-temperature combinations representative of those in the field. We found that the annual hatching fraction ranged from 6% to 50% among lakes, and that hatching fraction was primarily driven by environmental cues rather than being a result of the source of the eggs. However, laboratory incubations demonstrated significant differences among populations in the trajectories of the hatching curves, and a much higher rate of hatching than the field incubations. Our results suggest that variation in dormancy strategies within these systems is likely influenced both by the seasonal risk experienced by the active individuals and by risks associated with entering the dormant egg bank.																			0012-9658					MAY	2003	84	5					1189	1198		10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1189:HLTRTE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1189:HLTRTE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000184120500012

It is based on a comparison of geoarchaeological, pedological and pedoanthracological data from soil profiles in the coastal hilly and inland mountainous surroundings of Palmi and Cecita Lake, respectively. At the Palmi site, the representative soil profile includes settlements and artefacts ranging from late Neolithic to late early Bronze Age and undifferentiated historical epochs. The archaeological record of soils at Cecita spans from late Neolithic/early Eneolithic to Roman ages. At both sites, surface A horizons are affected by repeated plough marks. All soils display some Andisol-like features, related to some volcanic input during soil formation originating from late Pleistocene to Holocene explosive eruptions of the Aeolian Islands. The occurrence of clay coatings, their relict nature and overall dominant phyllosilicate clay minerals in the Neolithic soil horizons of both sites, suggest warm climate conditions with high moisture availability and some seasonal contrast, during the late early-middle Holocene climatic optimum. The post-Neolithic soils show comparable or more abundant amounts of short-range order minerals than phyllosilicates, and no to scarce clay coatings. These features indicate a transition towards (probably cooler) prolonged humid conditions, intercalated by one or more drought episodes. Severe land degradation is recorded between these major climatic phases, indicated by human impact (deforestation and agriculture) and soil erosion. Soil charcoal analysis from Cecita soils provide evidence of these anthropogenic environmental changes, as indicated by the dominance of deciduous oak forest in Neolithic soils, followed by a transition to a mountain pine forest recorded in the Roman soils. A deciduous oak forest characterizes the vegetation at Palmi from the Neolithic onward. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Specziár, A; Eros, T				Specziar, Andras; Eros, Tibor			Dietary variability in fishes: the roles of taxonomic, spatial, temporal and ontogenetic factors	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In spite of the general use of diet data in ecological research, still very little is known about the relative roles of spatial, temporal and biotic (e.g. taxonomic identity, size, sex) factors in dietary variability of fishes. Here, we applied canonical correspondence analysis and variation partitioning to examine the roles of taxonomic, annual, seasonal, lake basin, habitat and ontogenetic (standard length, L (S)) factors in the dietary variation of fishes in large and shallow Lake Balaton, Hungary. The analyses were performed at the assemblage (15 fish species) and the individual species levels, and based on high (24 fine resource categories) and low resolution (nine broad resource categories) diet data. As hypothesised, most of the explained variation related to interspecific differences, while the roles of sampling year, season, lake area, habitat and L (S) proved to be unexpectedly low at the assemblage level. In addition, no regularity was found in how the relative roles of these factors change between fish species. The high ratio of the unexplained variation suggests that individual variations in foraging strategies and resource use of fishes and unascertained stochastic processes had a strong influence on dietary variability both at the assemblage and the individual species levels.

Ecology of Biomphalaria (Gastropoda: Planorbidae) in Lake Albert, Western Uganda:: snail distributions, infection with schistosomes and temporal associations with environmental dynamics	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In Lake Albert, an ecological study was conducted, between June 2000 and May 2003, which assessed snail population dynamics, parasite infection patterns and interplay of environmental factors upon Biomphalaria. Monthly sampling surveys were conducted at 29 sites monitoring populations of Biomphalaria stanleyi and Biomphalaria sudanica. Altogether, a total of 21,715 B. stanleyi and 8452 B. sudanica were collected during the period. Both species could be found infected with Schistosoma mansoni although infection prevalence was significantly higher (p < 0.01**) in B. stanleyi (4.4%) than in B. sudanica (3.5%). Each species occupied slightly different aquatic niches with B. stanleyi preferring deeper water habitats whilst B. sudanica was found along the shoreline in shallower water. B. stanleyi was more widely distributed among the sampling locations (19 sites) than B. sudanica (10 sites). Of the four villages included in the study area, snails from sites near Piida and Bugoigo villages had the highest schistosome infection rates, presumably attributable to the closer proximity of people with intestinal schistosomiasis. After inspection of cross-correlation plots which identified most suitable time lags, snail density dynamics could be associated with seasonal variations inclusive of: air temperature, rainfall, lake level, water temperature, water conductivity and water pH. These temporal observations better reveal the relationship between snail populations and environmental factors, providing important information concerning the relative roles of B. stanleyi and B. sudanica in transmission of S. mansoni and development of integrated strategies for disease control around Lake Albert.

Few studies contemporarily investigate temporal variation of these freshwater communities for more than 1 year. We compared the temporal patterns of prokaryotes and protists in three distinct habitats for 4 years (2014-2017) in Lake Tovel, a cold-water lake. This lake showed a marked temperature increase in 2017 linked to altered precipitation patterns. We investigated whether microbial communities reflected this change across habitats and whether changes occurred at the same time and to the same extent. Furthermore, we tested the concept of hydrological year emphasizing the ecological effect of water renewal on communities for its explanatory power of community changes. Microbe diversity was assessed by Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene and 18S rRNA gene, and we applied co-inertia analysis and asymmetric eigenvector maps modelling to infer synchrony and temporal patterns of prokaryotes and protists. When considering community composition, microbes were invariable in synchrony across habitats and indicated a temporal gradient linked to decreasing precipitation; however, when looking at temporal patterns, the extent of synchrony was reduced. Small-scale patterns were similar across habitats and microbes and linked to seasonally varying environmental variables, while large-scale patterns were different and partially linked to an ecosystem change as indicated by increasing water transparency and temperature and decreasing dissolved oxygen. Our advanced statistical approach outlined the multifaceted aspect of synchrony when linked to community composition and temporal patterns.

The carbon isotopic composition of the escaping gas indicated that the methane is of biogenic origin. In our study, we investigated the fate of the released methane bubbles, i.e., the dissolution, oxidation or transport of the bubbles to the surface. At a littoral pockmark site (PM12, 12 m water depth) and a profundal pockmark (PM80, 80 m water depth), we analysed the dissolved methane concentrations and the methane isotopic carbon signature in the water column. At PM80, higher methane concentrations (up to 1,523 nM), compared to the control site and the surface waters (225 +/- A 72 nM), were recorded only on some occasions and only in the bottom water, despite the fact that the released bubbles were dissolving within the hypolimnion based on bubble modeling. The isotope data suggest that most of the dissolved methane is oxidized below 40 m water depth. The isotopic signature of the methane in the surface water at PM80, however, differed from that of the methane in the hypolimnion; therefore, the surface methane at this profundal site is most likely an export product from the littoral zone. Assuming an initial bubble diameter of 5 mm, we calculated that these small bubbles would reach the surface, but approximately 96 % of the methane would have dissolved from the bubble into the hypolimnion. At PM12, we observed higher concentrations of dissolved methane (312 +/- A 52 nM) with no significant differences between seasons or between control sites versus pockmark site. In the shallow water, divers estimated the bubble size to be 10-15 mm, which from a release depth of 12 m would barely dissolved into the water column. The isotopic signature also indicated that there had been almost no methane oxidation in the shallow water column. Thus, the water depth of bubble release as well as the initial bubble size determine whether the methane enters the atmosphere largely unhindered (shallow site) or if the released methane is incorporated into the profundal water column.

N-15 enriched Microcystis was injected into both unvegetated sediment and sediment occupied by common reed (Phragmites australis) in the littoral zone. Nutrient retention by the vegetated sediment was greater than by the unvegetated sediment, resulting in higher delta N-15 in the sediment nitrogen pool. The labeled Microcystis material was also distributed deeper into the vegetated sediment than the unvegetated sediment. A portion of the Microcystis-derived nitrogen was quickly assimilated, appearing first in the belowground biomass and subsequently in the aboveground biomass of the reed plants. The labeled nitrogen was found to support new growth as evidenced by N-15 enrichment of new leaves. This study indicates that common reed beds in the littoral zone may play an important role in retention of sedimented planktonic materials. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

L07708	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Oxygen isotope ratios of biogenic silica derived from planktonic diatoms living in the pelagial of a freshwater lake are used to determine the temperature effect on the isotope fractionation between water and biogenic silica under ecosystem conditions. Our data show a deterministic relation between seasonally changing water temperatures (4 degrees C-22 degrees C) and the oxygen isotope fractionation during valve formation. The temperature dependent fractionation appears to be independent of diatom cell sizes indicating a mere physical control of this process. The isotopic change induced per degree centigrade, the temperature coefficient, amounts to a value of -0.2 parts per thousand/degrees C. This implies that previous studies have overestimated the temperature relationship of this proxy by using coefficients of up to -0.5 parts per thousand/degrees C for climate reconstructions.

J	Stewart, KA; Lamoureux, SF				Stewart, Kailey Amanda; Lamoureux, Scott Fraser			Connections between River Runoff and Limnological Conditions in Adjacent High Arctic Lakes: Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut	ARCTIC												Hydrological and hydrochemical monitoring of paired watersheds in the High Arctic was conducted in 2003-04 to investigate the influence of seasonal runoff on lake water chemistry and productivity. Despite similar limnological conditions overall between the two lakes, marked differences in aquatic productivity were attributed to watershed and basin morphology and the resultant influences on lake ice deterioration and growing season length. A switch from allochthonous to autochthonous sources of carbon late in the season reflected the simultaneous decline in river runoff and increase in aquatic productivity as the growing season progressed. However, low air temperatures and protracted snowmelt and ponding in the deeply incised channel of one river in 2003 led to greater solute accumulation in runoff that was discernable in hydrochemical profiles of that lake, even though runoff was greater in 2004. Notwithstanding, calculated nutrient fluxes were greater during the higher-flow year (2004), but mixing was impeded by underflow conditions in the lakes. Despite these differences, connections between river and lake water chemistry appeared weak even with marked seasonal changes in the volume of runoff. Our results highlight the interconnection between site-specific features and hydroclimatic factors like snowmelt and lake ice conditions in influencing limnological conditions and suggest that similar systems may respond differently to the same hydroclimatic conditions.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				JUN	2011	64	2					169	182																WOS:000292226100003

During 2003, the fishes (N = 54) were sampled from three sites along Guaiba Lake (north, central and south zones). The hypotheses tested assumed that there were differences in the location and date as to levels of contamination, association between the trace metal content in the fishes and size, and that the sex influenced metal accumulation. Possible risks of contaminated fish consumption to human health were also evaluated. The level of mean concentration (mu g/g) of metals in tissues was higher in liver than muscle: [Cd] = 2.32 male; [Cr] = 0.08 female; [Cu] = 30.82 female and [Zn] = 97.77 female. The results showed differences between the local and date sampling for all metals except Cr. Metal content was higher in the warmer than colder seasons and in the central zone than at other points. Significant sexual differences were detected for Cd and Zn and there were positive associations between the size and metal concentrations for Cu and Zn. The concentration levels of metals in muscle tissue showed that the fish samples did not offer risks to human health.

S	Johnson, TC; Malala, JO		Dumont, HJ		Johnson, Thomas C.; Malala, John O.			Lake Turkana and Its Link to the Nile	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											Lake Turkana is a large, closed-basin lake in the northern Kenyan rift that occasionally overflowed first to the Indian Ocean and then, after about 1.3 million years ago, into the Nile drainage basin. The lake lies in a broad, and depression surrounded by late Cenozoic fluvial, lacustrine, and volcanic sequences. The climate of the Turkana basin is hot and arid, with extended periods of unusually intense diurnal winds. Seasonal variability in air temperature and rainfall is much subdued compared to the other great lakes of East Africa. Lake temperatures range between 24.5 degrees C and 30 degrees C, the salinity is about 2,500 mg/l, and the entire water column is oxygenated throughout most years. The lake's hydrological budget is dominated by Omo River input and by evaporation. Primary production in the lake is about 700-800 gC/m(2)y, and is typically limited to the upper 6 m of the turbid water column. Lake level has fluctuated more than 100 m in response to climate change. Analyses of sediment cores from within the modern lake and of lake deposits exposed onshore indicate that Lake Turkana overflowed into the Nile in the early Holocene (11.5-7.8 and 7.4-4.3 kyr), at 102 kyr, and at 195 kyr, with possible links at 123 and 172 kyr as well. Geochemical composition of much older (2.8-0.7 Ma) lacustrine sediments exposed to the east of the lake also suggest periodic overflow to the Nile, but the exact timing of these events are yet to be worked out. Additionally, Lake Turkana very likely was much lower than its present level during the last ice age and at other times of weakened African monsoon, perhaps even completely desiccated.

J	Minakawa, N; Seda, P; Yan, GY				Minakawa, N; Seda, P; Yan, GY			Influence of host and larval habitat distribution on the abundance of African malaria vectors in western Kenya	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												The abundance of anopheline mosquitoes varies substantially among houses within the same villages. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto is highly anthropophilic, and Anopheles arabiensis is zoophilic; thus, it is often hypothesized that the abundance of An. gambiae and An. arabiensis in a house is associated with the distribution of livestock and humans. In this paper we examined the influence of livestock and human host availability on the distribution and abundance of malaria vectors in the basin region of Lake Victoria in western Kenya. Larvae and adults of An. gambiae, An. arabiensis and Anopheles funestus were collected in the beginning and the end of the rainy season in 1999. Anopheles gambiae was the predominant species in both larval and adult samples. Multiple regression analyses found that the ratio of distance between houses and larval habitats to distance between cowsheds and larval habitats had a significant and negative association with the relative abundance of An. gambiae larvae for both sampling periods. The ratio of human density to cow density was positively correlated with the relative abundance of An. gambiae larvae in the late rainy period. For the adult samples, distance from a house to its nearest larval habitats was the only variable that showed a significant correlation with the An. gambiae density in houses in both sample periods. More than 90% of anopheline adults were found in the houses within 300 meters from the nearest larval habitats. Anopheline mosquito density was not correlated to the density of cows or humans, or the distance to cowsheds from houses. These results suggest that livestock and human host availability affect the relative abundance of An. gambiae larvae in aquatic habitats, but the distribution of anopheline adults in houses is determined by the distance from houses to larval habitats.

Synchrony of Piping Plover breeding populations in the US Northern Great Plains	CONDOR												Local populations that fluctuate synchronously are at a greater risk of extinction than those that do not. The closer the geographic proximity of populations, the more prone they are to synchronizing. Shorebird species select habitat broadly, and many breed across regions with diverse nesting habitat types. Under these conditions, nearby populations may experience conditions sufficiently different to prevent population synchrony, despite dispersal. In the U.S. Northern Great Plains, the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), federally listed as Threatened, is a migratory shorebird species that nests on the shorelines of rivers, reservoirs, and alkaline lakes. We assessed the degree to which local plover breeding population abundances were correlated (population synchrony), changed over time (population stability), and were influenced by environmental factors such as available habitat, precipitation, and within-season reservoir level rise. We found that the abundances of breeding populations nesting in riverine and reservoir habitats were the most synchronous, while populations nesting in alkaline lake habitats exhibited the greatest stability. Changes in local breeding population abundances were not explained by a single factor across habitat types. However, the abundances of local populations nesting in alkaline lake and river shoreline habitats were positively correlated with changes in nesting habitat availability. Our results suggest that dispersal among populations nesting in either river or reservoir and alkaline lake shoreline habitat may have an overall stabilizing effect on the persistence of the Great Plains Piping Plover metapopulation.

Suresh; Shin, Kyung-Hoon			Seasonal Changes in Mycosporine-Like Amino Acid Production Rate with Respect to Natural Phytoplankton Species Composition	MARINE DRUGS												After in situ incubation at the site for a year, phytoplanktons in surface water were exposed to natural light in temperate lakes ( every month); thereafter, the net production rate of photoprotective compounds ( mycosporine-like amino acids, MAAs) was calculated using C-13 labeled tracer. This is the first report describing seasonal variation in the net production rate of individual MAAs in temperate lakes using a compound-specific stable isotope method. In the mid-latitude region of the Korean Peninsula, UV radiation ( UVR) usually peaks from July to August. In Lake Paldang and Lake Cheongpyeong, diatoms dominated among the phytoplankton throughout the year. The relative abundance of Cyanophyceae ( Anabaena spiroides) reached over 80% during July in Lake Cheongpyeong. Changes in phytoplankton abundance indicate that the phytoplankton community structure is influenced by seasonal changes in the net production rate and concentration of MAAs. Notably, particulate organic matter ( POM) showed a remarkable change based on the UV intensity occurring during that period; this was because of the fact that cyanobacteria that are highly sensitive to UV irradiance dominated the community. POM cultured in Lake Paldang had the greatest shinorine ( SH) production rate during October, i. e., 83.83 +/- 10.47 fgC center dot L-1 center dot h(-1). The dominance of diatoms indicated that they had a long-term response to UVR. Evaluation of POM cultured in Lake Cheongpyeong revealed that there was an increase in the net MAA production in July ( when UVR reached the maximum); a substantial amount of SH, i. e., 17.62 +/- 18.34 fgC center dot L-1 center dot h(-1), was recorded during this period. Our results demonstrate that both the net production rate as well as the concentration of MAAs related to photoinduction depended on the phytoplankton community structure. In addition, seasonal changes in UVR also influenced the quantity and production of MAAs in phytoplanktons ( especially Cyanophyceae).					; Shin, Kyung-Hoon/AAD-6999-2021; Lee, Joe/B-9185-2008; Kumar, K.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the atmosphere of sub-alpine northern Italy	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The main objective of this work was to assess the atmospheric concentrations and seasonal variations of selected POPs in a sub-alpine location where few data are available. A monitoring and research station was set up at the JRC Ispra EMEP site (Italy). We present and discuss a one-year data set (2005-2006) on PCB air concentrations. Sigma 7PCBs monthly averaged concentration varied from 31 to 76 pg m(-3). Concentrations in the gas phase (21-72 pg m(-3)) were higher than those in the particulate phase (3-10 pg m(-3)). Advection of air masses and re-volatilization from local sources seem to play a dominant role as drivers of PCB atmospheric concentrations in the area. Indications of seasonal variation affecting PCB congener patterns and the gas/particulate partitioning were found. Modeling calculations suggest a predominant importance of the wet deposition in this region (1 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) Sigma 7PCBs yearly total wet deposition flux; 650-2400 pg L-1 rainwater concentrations).

In this study, we followed zooplankton variations in Lake Kivu for 3.5 years. Present Lake Kivu mesozooplankton is dominated by cyclopoid copepods (Thermocyclops consimilis, Mesocyclops aequatorialis and Tropocyclops confinis), but cladocerans and rotifers are also present. Each year, total crustacean abundance in the plankton increased to a distinct seasonal maximum following a rise of phytoplankton production associated with a deep epilimnetic mixing in the dry season (August-September). This dependence on phytoplankton resource suggests that mesozooplankton dynamics in Lake Kivu is mainly bottom-up controlled, contrary to expectations from the food web structure. However, measurements of body size indicate that sardine predation affects the cladoceran Diaphanosoma excisum, whereas the larger copepods may efficiently escape predation by migration in the deep mixolimnion at daytime. Total biomass of mesozooplankton in Lake Kivu is lower than in lakes Tanganyika and Malawi. This may be related to the disappearance of a large grazer that existed before the sardine introduction, whereas the large lakes of the same region have a more complex pelagic food web, with piscivorous fish, and with calanoid copepods, which can more efficiently exploit phytoplankton production.					; Sarmento, Hugo/W-3805-2019; Sarmento, Hugo/A-7655-2008	Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Sarmento, Hugo/0000-0001-5220-7992													0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV	2006	28	11					971	989		10.1093/plankt/fbl032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbl032													WOS:000241630100001

Spatial and seasonal patterns of rainfall erosivity in the Lake Kivu region: Insights from a meteorological observatory network	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												In the Lake Kivu region, water erosion is the main driver for soil degradation, but observational data to quantify the extent and to assess the spatial-temporal dynamics of the controlling factors are hardly available. In particular, high spatial and temporal resolution rainfall data are essential as precipitation is the driving force of soil erosion. In this study, we evaluated to what extent high temporal resolution data from the TAHMO network (with poor spatial and long-term coverage) can be combined with low temporal resolution data (with a high spatial density covering long periods of time) to improve rainfall erosivity assessments. To this end, 5 minute rainfall data from TAHMO stations in the Lake Kivu region, representing ca. 37 observation-years, were analyzed. The analysis of the TAHMO data showed that rainfall erosivity was mainly controlled by rainfall amount and elevation and that this relation was different for the dry and wet season. By combining high and low temporal resolution databases and a set of spatial covariates, an environmental regression approach (GAM) was used to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall erosivity for the whole region. A validation procedure showed relatively good predictions for most months (R-2 between 0.50 and 0.80), while the model was less performant for the wettest (April) and two driest months (July and August) (R-2 between 0.24 and 0.38). The predicted annual erosivity was highly variable with a range between 2000 and 9000 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) yr(-1) and showed a pronounced east-west gradient which is strongly influenced by local topography. This study showed that the combination of high and low temporal resolution rainfall data and spatial prediction models can be used to improve the assessments of monthly and annual rainfall erosivity patterns that are grounded in locally calibrated and validated data.					; six, johan/J-5228-2015; Doetterl, Sebastian/KIA-6575-2024; Baumgartner, Simon/JLL-9188-2023	six, johan/0000-0001-9336-4185; Doetterl, Sebastian/0000-0002-0986-891X; Baumgartner, Simon/0000-0002-4091-9164													0309-1333	1477-0296				DEC	2021	45	6					866	884	03091333211001793	10.1177/03091333211001793	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03091333211001793		MAR 2021											WOS:000630564300001

However, the dynamics of astaxanthin in calanoids at low latitudes are less studied. We collected samples during the ice-free season from Lake Mubanghai, an alpine lake located in a low-latitude and high-altitude region, and analyzed astaxanthin content changes among different developmental stages in Arctodiaptomus walterianus. The total astaxanthin content in A. walterianus varied from 1.66 to 4.49 mu g/mg dry weight and was highest in October, the month with the lowest temperature among the three sampling dates. Both free astaxanthin and astaxanthin esters content per biomass and the ratio of free astaxanthin increased from the nauplius to adult stage, and astaxanthin esters dominated in total astaxanthin in all developmental stages. The concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids were low in seston but were the main fatty acids in the calanoid. The total fatty acid concentration was positively correlated with the concentrations of total astaxanthin, free astaxanthin and astaxanthin esters in the calanoid. These results suggested that astaxanthin may be beneficial to the accumulation of fatty acids. This strategy may benefit calanoids in adaptation to high mountain environments at low latitudes.					; Wong, QH/GXV-9896-2022	Cui, Suzhen/0000-0002-9443-0938; Li, Yun/0000-0003-3655-2475; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR-APR	2021	43	2					314	324		10.1093/plankt/fbab019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbab019		MAR 2021											WOS:000642325100016

Taphonomy of the titanosaur Aeolosaurus colhuehuapensis, Upper Cretaceous, central Patagonia, Argentina: an example of preservation in overbank fluvial facies	REVISTA MEXICANA DE CIENCIAS GEOLOGICAS												Rests of Aeolosaurus colhuehuapensis, a titanosaur from the Colhue Huapi lake, in the southern Chubut Province, Argentina, were analyzed. The materials under study include twenty one caudal vertebrae and seven haemal arches. They were recovered articulated in overbank facies related to deposits of multi-channel fluvial systems of high sinuosity in the informally called "strata of the Colhue Huapi lake" of Campanian-Maastricthian age. These systems displayed important seasonal fluctuations in the paleodischarge and they were encompassed in a semi-arid climate. The taphonomic history was inferred from the analysis of several taphonomic characteristics present in the bones and macro- and micro-scopic sedimentologic observations. The presence of tenuous longitudinal striation, the absence of bone exfoliation, the articulate condition of the materials and the dorsal bow of the caudal series, support a short period of subaerial exposure with a rapid burial episode. The absence of abrasion marks in the materials indicates that they had scarce or null transport; therefore, they could be considered as autochthonous. The dorsal bow of the tail shows an opisthotonus posture, also exhibited by some theropod and sauropod dinosaurs, but undocumented in the Chubut Group. The recent fluctuant climatic conditions, with variations of extreme humidity and drought, strongly affected the preservation of the materials. The present work is the first detailed taphonomic study of a dinosaur preserved in proximal floodplain facies for the Chubut Group. Finally, the preservation of sauropod bones in those facies is relevant because this type of sub-environment possess a high rate of sediment input as well as scarce or null re-working of the skeletal remains, which favor the conservation of articulated skeletal elements. These findings are very important for the taphonomic and phylogenetic analysis of the titanosaur clade, in which the majority of the taxa are represented by isolated and unarticulated remains.

Potential methane production in oligohaline wetlands undergoing erosion and accretion in the Mississippi River Delta Plain, Louisiana, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Methane (CH4) is steadily increasing in the atmosphere from different sources including wetlands. However, there is lim-ited landscape level CH4 flux data in deltaic coastal systems where the availability of freshwater is impacted by the com-bined effect of climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here we determine potential CH4 fluxes in oligohaline wetlands and benthic sediments in the Mississippi River Delta Plain (MRDP), which is undergoing the highest rate of wet-land loss and most extensive hydrological wetland restoration in North America. We evaluate potential CH4 fluxes in two contrasting deltaic systems, one undergoing sediment accretion as result of a freshwater and sediment diversions (Wax Lake Delta, WLD), and one experiencing net land loss (Barataria-Lake Cataouatche, BLC). Short-(<4 days) and long-term (36 days) incubations using soil and sediment intact cores and slurries were performed at different temperatures rep-resenting seasonal differences (10, 20, 30 degrees C). Our study revealed that all habitats were net sources of atmospheric CH4 in all seasons, and CH4 fluxes were generally the highest for the 20 degrees C incubation. The CH4 flux was higher in the marsh hab-itat of the recently formed delta system (WLD) with total carbon content of 5-24 mg C cm-3 compared to the marsh habitat in BLC, which had high soil carbon content of 67-213 mg C cm-3. This suggests that the quantity of soil organic matter might not be a determining factor in CH4 flux. Overall, benthic habitats were found to have the lowest CH4 fluxes indicating that projected future conversions of marshes to open water in this region will impact the total wetland CH4 emission, al-though the overall contribution of such conversions to the regional and global carbon budgets is still unknown. Further re-search is needed to expand the CH4 flux studies by simultaneously using several methods across different wetland habitats.

JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu are generally considered to be a sedentary species. Previous tag-ging studies in lentic systems have found low annual movements based on fishery-dependent tag returns or limited detections from electronic transmitters, though occasional long-distance movements have been observed (i.e., >30 km). In this study, we implanted 23 smallmouth bass sampled from a recreational tournament in Lake Erie with acoustic transmitters and monitored their movements for two years (September 2018-September 2020) using a large-scale array of passive acoustic receivers. We docu-mented 42 percent (8/19) of the at-large fish making long-distance movements throughout Lake Erie; these fish moved an average distance of 109.9 +/- 26.6 km (mean +/- SE; ranging 3.5-355.1 km) per year. Importantly, six of eight fish crossed jurisdictional boundaries (five into Ontario waters and one into Michigan waters). One individual moved a total of 505.3 km over the two years, the furthest distance an individual smallmouth bass has been documented moving across the literature. While observed move-ments may have been initially biased due to tournament displacement and capture method, tagged fish continued to make long-distance movements in the second-year post-release. Previous movement stud-ies may have underestimated smallmouth bass movement scope in large, lentic systems due to low spa-tial and temporal coverage of recapture effort (including receiver coverage) relative to system size. Our results suggest that some smallmouth bass can make consistent long-distance movements in large sys-tems like the Laurentian Great Lakes, indicating this species' spatial ecology remains understudied in large lentic systems.<br />(c) 2023 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Zen, S; Perona, P; Medina-Lopez, E				Zen, Simone; Perona, Paolo; Medina-Lopez, Encarni			River delta eco-morphodynamics under changing scenarios: The case of Lake Turkana, Kenya	GEOMORPHOLOGY												In this work we explore the impact that changes in local climate and river hydrology have on the morphody-namics of a river delta, particularly focusing on the evolution of the delta generating at the lake inlet. We investigated the case of the delta in the lower reach of the Omo River in Ethiopia, which flows into lake Turkana, Kenya. The lake is the fourth largest lake and the largest desert lake in the world. This case study is of particular interest because within the last decades three dams have been built within the Omo basin. Among these, the Gibe III dam had a huge impact on the river hydrology and the sediment supply. To quantify changes in land use and river morphology and relate these to climate change and river hydrology we collated a historical dataset by combining information from different satellite sources. We observed that the amount of bare sediments pro-gressively diminished and the biomass became denser compared to the existence of sparse biomass in the past. We argue that this is due to the changes in river hydrology and sediment load imposed by the dam, which increased sediment erosion by deepening the channel. The presence of the dam also increased the low flow level and reduced the peak flow during flood season, reducing the natural oscillations of the water table. In conse-quence, the possibility to plant for the local population was removed during floods. Our findings also indicate that the hydrology and reduced sediment discharge have changed the downstream (e.g. lake level), and upstream (e.g. mouth bar deposition) boundary conditions controlling the evolution of the delta structure, respectively. As a result, the delta morphology became less dynamic and less complex.					; Medina-Lopez, Encarni/V-5514-2018	Perona, Paolo/0000-0002-5445-1451; Medina-Lopez, Encarni/0000-0001-5163-4511													0169-555X	1872-695X				MAY 1	2023	428								108640	10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108640	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108640		MAR 2023											WOS:000955178000001

Quasi-periodic decadal cycles in levels of lakes Michigan and Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												While Great Lakes' seasonal water-level variations have been previously researched and well documented, few studies thus far addressed longer-term, decadal cycles contained in the 143-yr lake-level instrumental record. Paleo-reconstructions based on Lake Michigan's coastal features, however, hinted to an approximate 30-yr quasi-periodic lake-level variability. in the present study, spectral analysis of 1865-2007 Lakes Michigan/Huron historic levels revealed 8 and 12-yr period oscillations; these time scales match those of large-scale climatic signals previously found in the North Atlantic. While the existing paleodata are inadequate to the task of asserting significance of the 30-yr signal, it is suggested here that this cycle is due to intermodulation of the two near-decadal signals. Furthermore, water budget analysis argues that the North Atlantic decadal climate modes translate to the lake levels primarily through precipitation and its associated runoff. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

These reservoirs were located on peat and forest soils and were built in 1967 and 1970, respectively. Over 20 years after their flooding, the reservoirs were still largely supersaturated with dissolved CH4 and CO2. Measured with floating static chambers, the stations in Lokka released more CH4 (means of 5.3-119 mg m(-2) d(-1)) during the open water periods in 1994 and 1995 than the stations in Porttipahta (means of 2.5-4.8 mg m(-2) d(-1)), measured in 1995. The mean CO2 emission rates in Lokka (21-133 mg m(-2) h(-1)) and Porttipahta (36-95 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) were more similar. The chamber measurements could not detect episodic CH4 ebullition in Lokka Reservoir, indicated by generally higher CH4 fluxes (means of 2.6-660 mg m(-2) d(-1)) obtained with bubble gas collectors than with the chambers. The seasonal mean N2O fluxes were generally low, ranging from -89 to 270 mug m(-2) d(-1). There was no clear association between the CH4 emissions and the bottom type, including mineral soils and old peat deposits. The flooded vegetation, higher nutrient content, and primary production in the water column rather than old peat could account for the higher CH4 emissions from the stations in Lokka. This conclusion is supported by the high content of modern carbon (C) in methane (percent modern C of 92-104%) that was extracted from the sediment of Lokka. The results suggested that if there is a good long-term availability of phosphorus and nitrogen, the intensive internal C cycle associated with the primary production could maintain high CH4 and CO2 production for decades, similar to the situation in eutrophied natural lakes.																			0886-6236					MAR	2002	16	1							1003	10.1029/2000GB001316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000GB001316													WOS:000178880800007

Understanding key demographic characteristics about lake sturgeon populations can help identify potential limiting factors to their recovery. Within a single spawning season, there may be multiple spawning events, which could affect genetic diversity of the resulting cohort. Our objective was to determine whether multiple discrete spawning events resulted in a larger effective number of breeders and higher genetic diversity. Larval samples were collected following the spawning periods in 2005 (n = 479) and 2006 (n = 279). In 2005, there were two discrete spawning events and a longer spawning season; in 2006, the spawning events were less discrete and the spawning season was shorter. Genetic samples from larval sturgeon were analyzed at 12 microsatellite loci. The effective number of breeders (N-b), genetic diversity (observed heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity, allelic richness, inbreeding coefficient), and relatedness were measured for each cohort. The effective population size (N-e) and genetic diversity were also measured in the adult population (n = 85). The larval cohorts had a high N-b (2005: 54; 2006: 73) relative to the N-e of the adult population (N-e = 28). Multiple spawning events did not result in more breeders, but did result in lower relatedness among the resulting offspring. Therefore, environmental factors should be maintained that encourage an extended spawning season, increasing the likelihood of multiple spawning events and decreasing the relatedness among individuals in the cohort.					; Welsh, Amy/CAG-2274-2022	Baerwald, Melinda/0000-0001-7462-5212; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				MAR	2015	98	3					755	762		10.1007/s10641-014-0309-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-014-0309-9													WOS:000349029800001

HYDROBIOLOGIA												It has been hypothesized that dabbling ducks (Anas spp.) time breeding to coincide with annual regional peaks in emerging dipterans, especially Chironomidae, which are important prey for newly hatched ducklings. However, this hypothesis has never been evaluated in a replicated lake-level study, including year effects in emergence patterns. We collected duck and invertebrate data from 12 lakes during the nesting seasons 1989-1994 in a watershed in southern Finland. The oligotrophic study lakes are typical of the boreal Holarctic, as are the three focal duck species: mallard Anas platyrhynchos L., widgeon Anas penelope L and teal Anas crecca L. Hatching of ducklings showed a clear peak in relation to ambient phenology (annual ice-out date of lakes), whereas chironomid emergence was more erratic and showed no clear peak at the lake level, although total watershed-level emergence was somewhat higher before and long after the duck hatching peak. Thus, we find no evidence that ducklings hatch in synchrony with abundance peaks of emerging chironomids. There was large within-year temporal variation in chironomid emergence among lakes, but this was not correlated with ambient temperature. The rank of individual lakes with respect to the abundance of emerging chironomids was consistent among as well as within years, a predictability that ought to make adaptive lake choice by ducks possible. On the lake level, there was a positive correlation between the total amount of emerging chironomids and brood use. We argue that emergence patterns of chironomids on typical boreal lakes are neither compressed nor predictable enough to be a major selective force on the timing of egg-laying and hatching in dabbling ducks. Despite spatial (among-lake) patterns of abundance of emerging chironomids being predictable within and among years, the observed pattern of brood use suggests that other factors, e.g. habitat structure, also affect lake choice.

Among the most useful traits for successful establishment in a new ecosystem are the size of the invader and its diet and feeding habits. During the last twenty years, Dikerogammarus villosus has been one of the most successful invaders of large European rivers and lakes. However, regarding feeding habits, results were confusing and sometimes contradictory. In this study, we attempt to define the feeding strategy of D. villosus using their FA content according to sex and the seasonal and the spatial variation in its feeding habit. Our results indicated that D. villosus is rather unspecialized with plasticity in its feeding behaviour, switching between different functional feeding groups depending on seasons, habitats and available resources. The selection of high quality resources may hence provide a strong advantage during the invasion process by optimizing the growth and the reproduction of the invader.					; Piscart, christophe/AAD-8973-2019; Maazouzi, Chafik/A-8275-2010	MASSON, Masson/0000-0003-3847-5784; piscart, christophe/0000-0002-4054-4542													1863-9135					DEC	2009	175	4					327	338		10.1127/1863-9135/2009/0175-0327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2009/0175-0327													WOS:000274359100006
J	Xu, ZH; Yin, XN; Yang, ZF; Cai, YP; Sun, T				Xu, Zhihao; Yin, Xinan; Yang, Zhifeng; Cai, Yanpeng; Sun, Tao			New model to assessing nutrient assimilative capacity in plant-dominated lakes: Considering ecological effects of hydrological changes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Assessing nutrient assimilative capacity of water body is an essential component of the Total Maximum Daily Load program. Nutrient assimilative capacity of lakes is affected by hydrological changes through physical effects on the dilution capacity of water body and ecological effects on nutrient removal processes. Previous research has focused on the effects of hydrological changes on dilution capacity, but rarely considered the ecological effects on nutrient assimilative capacity. In this study, a process-based model considering both ecological effects and dilution effects of hydrological changes is proposed for assessing nitrogen and phosphorus assimilative capacities of plant-dominated lakes. Plant uptake and biological denitrification are two crucial nutrient removal processes. Water depths in a lake affect plant growing area. Lake submerged condition affects nutrient accumulation capacity of plants and the intensity of biological denitrification. The model considered dynamic variations of lake water depths and submerged condition, and the associated effects on nutrient removal by plant nutrient uptake and biological denitrification in lake systems. It is a discrete OD model depending on a small amount of data and has satisfactory simulation accuracy. We chose the largest freshwater lake in northern China (Baiyangdian Lake) as a case. The annual total assimilative capacity in the lake was 1536 t for nitrogen and 157 t for phosphorus. Assimilative capacity during plant-growing season accounted for over 90% of the annual total capacity. The results determined by the new model were less than half of that from previous model, demonstrating the significance of considering ecological effects of hydrological changes. The new assessment model offers a useful tool for directing pollutant emission control and eutrophication prevention in global plant-dominated lakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

One hundred and forty six species are definitively recorded from within Danau Sentarum National Park (DSNP) boundaries; 43 (29 %) of them have been recorded for the first time during the present survey. Eleven species new to science have been discovered and nine additional species are either new or require further study before their identity can be cleared. Taxonomy of Chitala, Scleropages and Parachela are briefly discussed. The published data do not justify recognising more than one Southeast Asian species of Scleropages. Macrognathus tapirus is proposed as a new replacement name for Mastacembelus paucispinis Fowler, 1939. A neotype is designated for Ophidium aculeatum Bloch. A large number of fish species migrate upriver to headwaters or downriver to the Kapuas main river at some time of the year; in addition there are lateral movements between the rivers and lakes and the flooded forest during the wet season.																			0217-2445	2345-7600				JUL 1	2005				13			139	173																WOS:000231257500011

Indirect consequences of hypolimnetic hypoxia on zooplankton growth in a large eutrophic lake	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												Diel vertical migration (DVM) of some zooplankters in eutrophic lakes is often compressed during peak hypoxia. To better understand the indirect consequences of seasonal hypolimnetic hypoxia, we integrated laboratory-based experimental and field-based observational approaches to quantify how compressed DVM can affect growth of a cladoceran, Daphnia mendotae, in central Lake Erie, North America. To evaluate hypoxia tolerance of D. mendotae, we conducted a survivorship experiment with varying dissolved oxygen concentrations, which demonstrated high sensitivity of D. mendotae to hypoxia (<= 2 mg O-2 l(-1)), supporting the field observations of their behavioral avoidance of the hypoxic hypolimnion. To investigate the effect of temporary changes in habitat conditions associated with the compressed DVM, we quantified the growth of D. mendotae, using a 3 (food quantity) x 2 (temperature) factorial design laboratory experiment. Neither food quantity nor temperature affected short-term growth in body length of D. mendotae. However, D. mendotae RNA content (an index of short-term condition) decreased under starvation, indicating an immediate response of short-term feeding on condition. We further evaluated the effect of hypoxia-induced upward shifts in vertical distribution by quantifying the RNA content of D. mendotae from central Lake Erie before and during peak hypoxia. Despite high temperature and food quantity in the upper water column, RNA content in field-collected D. mendotae remained low during peak hypoxia. Furthermore, D. mendotae collected during peak hypoxia consisted of only small-bodied (<similar to 1.25 mm) individuals, suggesting that behavioral avoidance of the hypoxic hypolimnion may also have indirect fitness costs.

To analyse the nutrient characteristics and estimate the nutrient load in streams, we conducted extensive field survey and water quality experiments from 2007 to 2008 in Koise River, a major river of the Lake Kasumigaura watershed, Japan. Water quality indicators of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and total organic carbon (TOC) were investigated. The nutrient loads of TN, TP and TOC, as well as dissolved total nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, particle organic nitrogen, dissolved total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon and particle organic carbon were also estimated for the Koise River. Seasonal variation of the nutrient concentration from 2007 to 2008 was analysed considering the river discharge variation and agricultural activities. The results showed that the irrigation water from Lake Kasumigaura has the potential ability to decrease the TN concentration and increase the TOC concentration in the Koise River. Significant correlation coefficients between nutrient load and river discharge were found. The monthly pollution loads from different sources were then evaluated based on land cover classification generated from high-resolution Quick Bird remote sensing imagery. This study presents a useful interpretation of water quality data sets with a view to obtaining better information about water quality for more effective management of water resources in river basins.

Factors influencing long-term and seasonal waterbird abundance and composition at two adjacent lakes in Zimbabwe	OSTRICH												The spatial and temporal structures of waterbird communities are dynamic and complex with many driving factors. We used long-term waterbird census data at two lakes in Zimbabwe to explore the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of waterbird community composition and abundance. Ecological drivers predicted to influence waterbird communities include rainfall quantity and distribution, waterbird movement, breeding and moulting; anthropogenic drivers include activities such as fishing and agriculture. Results suggest that seasonal variations in resource availability influenced the waterbird community composition and abundance, as did movements at local, regional, and intercontinental scales. Bird numbers in the two perennial lakes experienced large changes in structure during two droughts. We also used the study as a baseline for considering the risk of spread of avian influenza virus (AIV) spread in waterbird communities in Zimbabwean lakes, which is likely to be higher in dry seasons and during drought years when waterbird abundance is high. Our study emphasises the importance of long-term ecological data in understanding crucial aspects of biodiversity conservation as well as pathogen dynamics in wild waterbird communities, with important management implications.					; Gaidet, Niccolas/H-8122-2013; Caron, Alexandre/F-8969-2010; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel/AAI-1550-2019	Mundava, Josephine/0000-0003-2062-3216; Caron, Alexandre/0000-0002-5213-3273; 													0030-6525	1727-947X					2012	83	2					69	77		10.2989/00306525.2012.692726	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2012.692726													WOS:000308107800001

In this paper we present stable isotope compositions of living and prehistoric shells of freshwater mussels (Unionidae) and their relationships with climate conditions in a shallow lake environment of Lake Balaton, West-Central Hungary. Physical conditions and stable oxygen isotope compositions of lake water samples were monitored where living bivalves were collected. Comparisons between seasonal variations in ambient temperature, water composition and within-shell isotopic variations indicate that the shells of Unio pictorum do reflect local changes at high resolution and thus can be used to study past conditions. Additionally, shells covering the last two decades were gathered at several locations along the lake in order to determine spatial and temporal variations in the shells' isotopic compositions as a function of weather conditions. As an application, prehistoric shells collected in archaeological excavations were analysed in order to study past environmental variations. Climate variations during the Late Copper Age (5460-4870 cal. yr BP) have been assumed on the basis of geomorphological and archaeozoological observations at the site BalatonkeresztA(0)r-R,ti-dA +/- lA (south of Lake Balaton), that suggested increasing humidity as a cause of changes in settlement location and domestic livestock husbandry. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of prehistoric bivalve shells were analyzed from excavations representing five archaeological subphases (Boleraz subphase, 5460-5310 cal. yr BP; two transitional subphases around 5310 cal. yr BP; Early Classic subphase, 5310-5060 cal. yr BP; Late Classic subphase, 5040-4870 cal. yr BP). The analyses revealed significant negative C and O isotope shifts in the transitional subphases relative to the earlier and later subphases. The isotopic variations indicate that the local climate became relatively wet and possibly cold around 5310 cal. yr BP, then it returned to drier (and likely warmer) conditions during the Classic subphases. This interpretation is in agreement with previous studies on climate changes related to the "5.3 ky event" in the European continental area and the North Atlantic Region, indicating an Atlantic influence in the Carpathian Basin.					; Fórizs, István/E-7622-2015; Bajnóczi, Bernadett/AAT-4550-2021	Bajnoczi, Bernadett/0000-0003-0006-7611; Forizs, Istvan/0000-0003-0813-6079; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2012	47	1					87	100		10.1007/s10933-011-9561-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-011-9561-6													WOS:000297723300007

Effect of sex and age on temporal variation in the frequency and direction of platypus (Omithorhynchus anatinus) captures in fyke nets	AUSTRALIAN MAMMALOGY												Fyke netting is currently the method mainly used to describe the demographic attributes of platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) populations occupying relatively shallow, flowing water bodies. Based on fieldwork carried out in Victoria from 1995 to 2010, fyke netting surveys conducted in the month when the highest frequency of nightly captures was recorded (July) resulted in nearly three times as many adults and subadults entering nets as compared with those scheduled in the months when the fewest nightly captures were recorded (April and May). Significant sex-specific variation was apparent in relation to monthly capture frequencies: males were captured most often in August (the start of the breeding season), whereas females were captured most often in January (the peak period of lactation). The frequency of platypus captures also varied significantly when considered on a nocturnal time scale, with 63% of adult and subadult captures and 73% of juvenile captures being recorded in the first half of the night. Both juveniles (<11 months) and older animals also showed a significant tendency to travel upstream in the first half of the night. These potential sources of bias in datasets need to be considered when analysing and comparing the results of platypus fyke netting studies.

Hemimysis anomala in Lake Ontario food webs: Stable isotope analysis of nearshore communities	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hemimysis anomala, a littoral freshwater mysid native to the Ponto-Caspian region, is the newest invader to the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. Discovered in 2006, they have since been found in all of the Great Lakes (except Lake Superior) and have the potential to offset the dietary energy sink caused by invasive dreissenid mussels (Dreissena bugensis and D. polymorpha) in the littoral zone. We evaluated nearshore food web structure at four sites along Lake Ontario's north shore spanning a gradient of Hemimysis density to determine: 1) if dominant nearshore food web pathways change seasonally, and 2) whether fish are exhibiting a dietary shift towards consumption of Hemimysis. No Hemimysis were found in any of the 431 fish (alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, and yellow perch Perca flavescens) stomachs analysed. We used stable isotopes of carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) collected from invertebrates and fish to characterise trophic linkages and fish dietary preference. Yellow perch and round goby exhibited significantly higher Delta delta N-15 at Bronte (high Hemimysis density) compared to Cobourg, Waupoos and the Bay of Quinte. Delta delta C-13 of alewife is more enriched at Bronte and is comparable to the Delta delta C-13 of Hemimysis. Our results suggest that Hemimysis are being incorporated into diets of round gobies, alewife and small yellow perch and their reliance on Hemimysis as a dietary component increases with Hemimysis density. As Hemimysis populations continue to establish and stabilize, fish may incorporate this species into their diets at a higher rate. (C) 2011 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

A 2 x 5 field experimental design was used to determine how variations in light regimes (presence and absence of UVR [+UVR and -UVR]) and nutrients might influence the strength of phytoplankton-zooplankton coupling (PZC). We observed unimodal curves for zooplankton biomass in response to increased food supply from nutrient enrichment. These results challenge the "more is better (or at least never worse)" concept, since high food levels resulted in weakened PZC. The effect of UVR on zooplankton was nutrient dependent, significantly reducing zooplankton abundance at intermediate phosphorus (P) supplied levels but not at the two ends of the trophic gradient generated (control and highest P level). Neither food quantity nor food quality explained observed differences in zooplankton biomass between light treatments, suggesting a deleterious direct effect of UVR on zooplankton at intermediate food ranges, resulting in a weakening of PZC. The location of this lake in the Mediterranean region has shown an increasing intensity and frequency of aerosol depositions over the past three decades (1973-2003), resulting in higher phytoplankton biomass. A combination of these higher atmospheric dust depositions with the high UVR levels characteristic of high mountain lakes might underlie the interannual decoupling between phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics observed in these oligotrophic ecosystems.					; Medina Sanchez, Juan Manuel/A-4703-2013; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/L-9085-2014; Medina-Sánchez, Juan/A-4703-2013; Carrillo, Presentacion/I-1601-2015; Carrillo, Presentación/I-1601-2015	Bullejos Carrillo, Francisco Jose/0000-0002-0335-3923; Medina Sanchez, Juan Manuel/0000-0003-0991-9331; Villar-Argaiz, Manuel/0000-0002-3288-8900; Carrillo, Presentacion/0000-0003-3794-4294; 													0024-3590					NOV	2010	55	6					2549	2562		10.4319/lo.2010.55.6.2549	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.6.2549													WOS:000287844700026
J	Dolinar, N; Gaberscik, A				Dolinar, Natasa; Gaberscik, Alenka			Mycorrhizal colonization and growth of Phragmites australis in an intermittent wetland	AQUATIC BOTANY												Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungal colonization of Phragmites australis roots and its relation to plant productivity parameters was investigated in an intermittent karst wetland Lake Cerknica (Slovenia) with seasonal water level fluctuations. Mycorrhizal colonization was determined five times in 2008-from the beginning to the end of the growing season-in three reed stands with large differences in soil parameters and water level changes. AM and DSE colonization varied significantly between sampling plots and during the growing season (7% < frequency < 87%). The flooding of two of the three reed stands decreased mycorrhiza early in the growing season, but further flooding had no additional effect. Levels of DSE colonization were high in the beginning and the end of the growing season, while a peak in AM colonization was observed towards the end. The observed positive in situ correlation between mycorrhizal colonization and P. australis growth parameters does not allow final mechanistic conclusion: both P. australis and mycorrhiza could be beneficial.

Within these zones of variation, systems and environmental processes interact. They can recreate sediment movement patterns and anticipate environmental evolution. This study utilises a non-parametric end-member modelling analysis (EMMA) as a deterministic approach for unmixing grain sizes into geologically relevant populations. The aim is to characterise seasonal grain size distribution variation and link seasonal end members to proximal sources. A 5-year analysis of seasonal data from 19 open-coast beaches is adopted in the North and South Goa coastal area. End-members (EMs) are assigned based on grain size modal classes of 32-63 mu m (EM1), 63-125 mu m (EM2), 125-250 mu m (EM3), and 250-500 mu m (EM4), corresponding to coarse silt, very fine sand, fine sand, and medium sand respectively. In response to the current hydrodynamic forcings, it is projected that the surface sediments analysed have been reworked, sorted, and redistributed. While the spatial trend of EM distribution indicates an abundance of EM2 and EM3 along the coast, the variability in EMs across seasons shows that the Southwest and Northeast monsoons significantly influence the distributions of sediments along the Goa Coast, and the underlying EMs in the sediments bear the imprint of the interaction of these two seasons' dominant forces.

Numerous studies worldwide have confirmed the presence of these eukaryotic pathogens in nesting and migrating wild geese, ducks, and swans. Migration spreads these zoonotic enteric pathogens to distant locations, which could have public health implications. Soils and water bodies (lakes, ponds, rivers and wetlands) in urban and suburban areas have been shown to be vulnerable to contamination by waterfowl droppings. This review addresses the epidemiology of these enteric pathogens in wild migratory bird species (Anatidae) and some consequences of their spread in the environment. To date, both zoonotic pathogens and genotypes restricted to avian hosts have been found in faecal samples from 21 anatid species worldwide. One of the routes of infection for these zoonotic gastrointestinal micropathogens is the indirect route. For example, shared water bodies (e.g., for drinking or recreational purposes) previously contaminated by birds during the migratory season may facilitate infections of humans through water. However, it is unclear how much wild waterfowl contribute to the transmission of giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporosis, and microsporidiosis in many regions through contaminated environmental sources. Comprehensive epidemiological surveillance based on molecular data on gastrointestinal pathogens is crucial to take measures to control infections in the future.

Agricultural and urban activities have a significant impact on the water quality of the river. Regardless of physical and chemical variables, phytoplankton act as a bio-indicator of water quality due to their fast and sensitive response to changes in the environment. Our research was conducted in the Tigris River within the city of Mosul by examining the phytoplankton species and the physical-chemical variables at 16 sites during each vegetation period. Point and non-point source pollutants have affected the Tigris River within the city of Mosul, getting into the river from upstream through agricultural activities and by urban activities in the middle section of the city, respectively from both banks. Based on our results, we observed the highest phytoplankton abundance during the October sampling periods, while the lowest occurred during the July sampling period, which was associated with maximum water temperature and absence of rain. According to our study, land use (e.g., agricultural, and urban activities) greatly affected the dominant phytoplankton species and physical-chemical variables of the Tigris River. Oscillatoria sp. dominated all seasons in the agricultural region, while at the same time, we observed an increase in the number of phytoplankton species caused by the nutrient availability upstream on the river. The effects of climate have very significant and characteristic effects in this area, which basically determine the community of organisms and the water quality; the effects resulting from anthropogenic activity significantly modify this. Based on our investigation, in the part of the Tigris River connected to Mosul, we found a clear connection between the pollution caused and the effects of different land uses, through the examination of the algal community and physical-chemical variables in different periods of the year.					; Yaqoob, Majd/ABB-9337-2021; Bácsi, István/ACX-9726-2022; Csaba, Berta/AES-0541-2022; Al-Tayawi, Aws/ADG-0636-2022	Berta, Csaba/0000-0003-4899-7527; Somlyai, Imre/0009-0009-0379-4196; Al-Tayawi, Aws N/0000-0001-6639-2471; Yaqoob, Majd/0000-0003-3192-2609; 														2073-4441				MAR	2023	15	6							1062	10.3390/w15061062	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15061062													WOS:000958832100001

Two artisanal trap designs were constructed from inexpensive plastic soda bottles. In 1 design the plastic bottle was clear, and in the other design the plastic bottle had the bottom 20% painted yellow. These 2 traps and 1 McPhail trap were placed in replicated groups in the mango orchard. The mean number of flies captured in clear artisanal traps (13 flies) was similar to that captured in the McPhail trap (16 flies), but the cost of 20 artisanal traps (US $70) was less than 1 third of the cost of 20 McPhail traps (US $220). A 2nd field trial was implemented to compare the number of flies captured in 24 McPhail traps per ha (236 flies) to the number of flies captured in 36 clear artisanal traps per ha (239 flies). The number of flies captured did not differ significantly between the 2 trap type densities. A 3rd experiment evaluated the optimal trap density for mass trapping fruit flies. Our data indicated that a density of 25 traps per ha is adequate to protect a mango orchard through the maturation phase of the mango season. These results indicated that cost-effective artisanal traps can replace the McPhail trap for mass trapping fruit flies in Haiti.

J	Zhan, LC; Chen, JS; Li, L				Zhan, Lucheng; Chen, Jiansheng; Li, Ling			Isotopic assessment of fog drip water contribution to vegetation during dry season in Junshan wetland, northern Dongting Lake	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Stable isotopes H-2 and O-18 of fog drip water, lake water, soil profiles, and vegetation leaves in Junshan wetland of East Dongting Lake, China, were investigated to estimate the contribution of fog drip water to wetland vegetation. Because of its recycled terrestrial meteoric water source, fog drip water is characterized by isotopic compositions that plot above the local meteoric water line (LMWL). Lake water undergoes intense evaporation owing to its low water volume and long residence time. The isotopic compositions of soil water suggest that it is recharged by both recent rainfall and fog drip water. A binary mixing model shows that approximately 16% of unsaturated soil water originates from continuous recharge by fog drip water, reaching 31% in surface soil where the vegetation roots are mainly distributed. Inspired by the literatures on acidification of intercepted clouds and fog as the major factor in forest die-back in Europe, the findings in this study inform future investigations into the relationships between fog water deposition and wetland degradation especially in heavily industrialized foggy areas.

J	Shunk, AJ; Driese, SG; Dunbar, JA				Shunk, Aaron J.; Driese, Steven G.; Dunbar, John A.			Late Tertiary paleoclimatic interpretation from lacustrine rhythmites in the Gray Fossil Site, northeastern Tennessee, USA	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Gray Fossil Site (GFS) includes a small (< 2 ha) paleosinkhole lake fill with an exceptionally well-preserved record of sedimentation and fossils from the latest Miocene to earliest Pliocene. The uppermost lacustrine stratigraphy is characterized by rhythmites that regularly alternate between coarse-grained and organic-rich (A) laminae and fine-grained, silty clay (B) laminae. Both the A and B components are almost exclusively comprised of exogenic sediment (including organic matter). Periodicities of 24 and 4.4 are recorded within a continuous 96 interpreted year sequence of rhythmite sediment. In a small lake with a poorly oxygenated bottom, the presence of laterally continuous laminated sediment that includes well-known periodicities in rhythmite thickness is interpreted as representing annually generated varves that correspond to seasonal variations in sedimentation. The distinctly larger fraction of medium sand-size quartz grains present within the A laminae, as well as the abrupt transitions between A and B components suggest that the rhythmites represent deposition during alternating high-energy and lower-energy seasons, which is consistent with a monsoonal precipitation pattern. The seasonal climate may relate to changes in the ocean circulation pattern prior to 4.6 Ma that resulted in an increased temperature and atmospheric pressure gradient between the east coast of North America and the Atlantic Ocean, but this climate phase seems to be only a temporary condition, as underlying and overlying sediment are both consistent with drier conditions. The periodicity at 24 interpreted years is consistent with the well-known Hale solar cycle. The 4.4 interpreted-year periodicity occurs within the ENSO frequency band, and if this documentation of ENSO-like interannual climate change is correct, then it suggests that ENSO operated at times during the warm Earth conditions characterizing the late Tertiary.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2009	42	1					11	24		10.1007/s10933-008-9244-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9244-0													WOS:000266911700002

The lakes in 2000 and 2001 presented different limnological characteristics between the periods of high and low water. The phytoplankton comprised 292 taxa, mainly Chlorophyceae and nanoplankton. In the dry seasons of both years, the functional group Y (Cryptophyceae) was the most prominent association. In high-water periods, different functional groups dominated the lakes. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated a separation between the rainy and dry seasons of both years. The high and low water presented different dynamics in 2 years due to the influence of the flood pulse.

J	Einsele, G; Yan, JP; Hinderer, M				Einsele, G; Yan, JP; Hinderer, M			Atmospheric carbon burial in modern lake basins and its significance for the global carbon budget	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Lake basins (similar to 2.7 X 10(6) km(2), about 0.8% of the ocean surface or 2% of the land surface) bury a surprisingly high amount of atmospheric carbon (similar to 70 X 10(6) t/a) which reaches more than one fourth of the annual atmospheric carbon burial in the modern oceans. This is mainly accomplished by the rapid accumulation of lacustrine sediments and a very high preservation factor (on average 50 times higher than that in the oceans). Lakes with relatively large drainage areas commonly display the highest carbon accumulation rates. In most cases, burial of organic matter is more important than that of carbonate carbon produced by silicate weathering, in contrast to the oceans where the burial of atmospheric carbonate carbon almost reaches the same amount as that of organic carbon. Exceptions to this rule are closed lake basins in arid to semiarid climate which precipitate a major part of their atmosphere-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as carbonate. These results are demonstrated in some detail for L. Qinghai, China, (low contribution of atmospheric carbonate carbon) and L. Turkana, East Africa, (high contribution from silicate rocks). Further data are gained by estimates for a number of closed and open lakes. The drainage areas of the lakes withdraw atmospheric carbon at rates of mostly 1-4 g/m(2)/a, calculated from the lacustrine carbon burial. Carbon burial rates in lakes commonly increase with change to wetter and warmer climate (partially larger lake surfaces, higher rates of seasonal carbonate precipitation, trend to stratified lake waters with oxygen-deficient bottom water). Anthropogenic influence mostly enhances the production and preservation of organic carbon in lake basins (often by a factor of 3-4). After the last glacial maximum, the joint action of the globally spreading vegetation, peat growth, and carbon burial in lakes would have been able to reduce the atmospheric carbon pool to one third to one half of its present amount within a time period of 1 ka. However, CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean has brought about an overall increase in the atmospheric CO2 during the Holocene. The contribution of lakes and artificial reservoirs in counteracting matt-made CO2 emissions should not be neglected. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To study those communities, researchers have begun to explore how local environmental factors influence species composition patterns at relatively fine scales within complex habitat mosaics. However, a robust description of the link between communities' composition and their floodplain habitat characteristics remains poorly articulated. In the Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) of Cambodia, we evaluated whether mesohabitat-scale (1-5 km) factors throughout the floodplain structured the fish assemblage temporally and spatially. First, we determined whether TSL fish assemblage changed seasonally and, if so, what assemblage components were driving that change. Second, we determined whether environmental factors structured fish composition across floodplain mesohabitat patches during the wet season. Third, we evaluated whether dominant species displayed affinities for specific areas within the floodplain during the wet season, potentially identifying critical mesohabitat patches for the fish assemblage. Fish were collected from nine sites along an elevational gradient traversing the floodplain every 3 months from March 2014 through January 2015. Correspondence analysis and analysis of variance were used to assess seasonal variation in the species composition. Canonical correspondence analysis and a mantel test were then used to identify the significance of environmental factors structuring the fish assemblage. Fish assemblages changed across seasons; in particular, migratory species occurrence decreased during the dry season. During the wet season, the fish assemblage was structured spatially by mesohabitat-scale factors such as vegetation and water quality. Furthermore, the flooded forest mesohabitat directly adjacent to the permanent lake displayed particularly high species richness and abundance. However, a majority of TSL species appeared to be highly mobile, occurring across multiple floodplain mesohabitats. We concluded that fish assemblage structure and floodplain mesohabitat use within TSL may depend strongly upon the maintenance of the natural flow regime. Since the flow regime will probably be modified by upstream dam development, trade-offs will emerge between the cycle of fishing on which local residents depend, and the hydropower and agricultural benefits of damming the Mekong River system.

These methods include: counting annual rings, analysis of size-frequency distributions, following growth under experimental conditions and monitoring marked mussels under natural conditions. without removing them from substrate. The last method provides the most reliable data, however this is the least common method used. Dreissena polymorpha growth rates depend on water temperature, season of the year, location in the water column, food availability, oxygen concentrations, water velocity and various other environmental factors. However, it is very difficult to separate the independent effects of each of these factors, especially in natural waterbodies. Several factors may overlap and have additive or synergistic effect that makes it difficult to determine the effects of a single factor. When comparing among studies that used the same methods, we found that zebra mussels grow faster in reservoirs than in lakes. The reported longevity of D. polymorpha varies from 2-19 y and it is not clear to what extent this variation is caused by biological variability and environmental conditions and what amount of the variation is caused by the methods used to assess age and longevity.

The results revealed that both DIN and DIP exhibited large seasonal variability. DIN (dominated by NH4-N) concentrations were drastically higher in the dry season than those in the rainy season, and the same seasonal patterns of DIP concentrations and DIN and DIP fluxes were observed but inverse to that of DIN concentrations. The interannual variation in DIN fluxes descended by 28.2% from 2007 to 2008, while DIP fluxes increased by 40.9%, which were closely constant with interannual changes in DIN and DIP concentrations, respectively. The study indicated that nutrient fluxes (DIN and DIP) were strongly correlated with both nutrient concentrations and river discharge, and the Linjiang Bay received approximately 3,416 x 10(3) kg DIN and 324 x 10(3) kg DIP every year. In addition, DIN mainly originated from point sources, but DIP originated from non-point sources. It is shown that to control point source pollution is the most effective step for water quality improvement and reducing nutrient loading inputs in the Linjiang Bay.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2011	173	1-4					55	64		10.1007/s10661-010-1370-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1370-2								20213063					WOS:000287982000006

Changes in the community were studied over 6 hydroperiods during 1996 and 1997. Community dynamics were analyzed using multivariate analysis and a new statistical approach based on the Pareto probability distribution. Three successional phases could be distinguished on the basis of changes in taxon abundance. This pattern is consistent with the 3-phase model reported in other temporary ponds in temperate latitudes. The 1(st) and 3(rd) phases corresponded to changes in hydrological factors (pond drying, water turnover) and to seasonality, whereas the 2(nd) phase corresponded to more stable hydrological conditions. Five successional phases could be distinguished on the basis of biomass-size spectra with similar structure. These phases were consistent with variations over time of parameter c of Pareto Model I. The 3 middle phases (II, III, and IV) identified using the size-spectrum approach corresponded to the single middle phase identified using the taxonomic approach. Thus, community changes during the middle phase were better resolved by analysis of the biomass-size spectrum than by analysis of taxon abundance.

In a first step, two multi-temporal Landsat TM 5 satellite images, one from the wet and the second from the dry season, were visually classified into different land-use types. Next, the normalized difference vegetation index was extracted from the images and the tasseled-cap transformation was employed to derive the wetness feature. Our model predicted an estimated 709 km(2) of the marshlands in Poyang Lake as potential habitats for O. hupensis. Near-ground temperature measurements in April and August yielded a range of 22.8-24.2 degrees C, and pH values of 6.0-8.5 were derived from existing records. Both climatic features represent suitable breeding conditions for the snails. Preliminary validation of the model at 10 sites around Poyang Lake revealed an excellent accuracy for predicting the presence of O. hupensis. We used the predicted snail habitats as centroids and established buffer zones around them. Villages with an overall prevalence of S. japonicum below 3% were located more than 1200 m away from the centroids. Furthermore, a gradient of high-to-low prevalence was observed with increasing distance from the centroids. In conclusion, the model holds promise for identifying high risk areas of schistosomiasis japonica and may become an important tool for the ongoing national schistosomiasis control programme. The model is of particular relevance for schistosome-affected regions that lack accurate surveillance capabilities and are large enough to be detected at most commercially available remote sensing scales.

The study site is a small intermountain basin in the Sayan-Tuva Upland, 51 degrees N., 97 degrees E., 1300 m a.s.l. Paleo-archives covering about 13,000 yrs were studied: paleosol-sedimentary sequences on a delta-alluvial fan of a small river, lacustrine sediments in bottom cores and on palsa-islands and soils of palsa-islands. The following sequence of environmental changes was established. The fluvial activity in the basin reached its maximum at the end of the Late Pleistocene. The sharp decrease of the fluvial activity is terminated by two successive paleosols of Pleistocene-Holocene transition. The older paleosol indicates meadow-steppe (or tundra-steppe) conditions with a shallow permafrost table and impeded drainage. The younger paleosol testifies on sharp aridization, biological activity suppression, contrasting water regime, and warming. Dammed lake appeared in the midst of the trough about 11,000 cal yr BP. Sedimentation on delta-alluvial fan was fairly inconsiderable in Holocene. The first part of Holocene (before 4000 cal yr BP) was most balanced in annual distribution of precipitation. Runoff, even being prominently enhanced in a fluvial and relatively warm sub-phase 8000-6250 cal yr BP, was canalized, without giving seasonal floods. Sub-phase 6250-3800 is characterized by increased continentality and relative aridization caused reduction of runoff, lowering of the lake level, and enhancement of cryogenic processes. The next phase 3800-2000 cal yr BP was more humid. It caused slight revival of fluvial processes and rise of lake level. The last 2000 years climate was more continental and the most arid within the studied period. The lake level and runoff values dropped again, and fluvial activity totally decreased. In contemporary soils aridization is reflected in widely spread Natric features and progressive salinization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Population Dynamics of Double-Crested Cormorants in Two Interior Breeding Areas	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Because of rapid population expansion, conflicts between double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) and humans have increased, particularly at aquaculture facilities in the Lower Mississippi River Valley (LMRV), United States. Although key demographic information on the Interior population is sparse, management decisions for population reduction are already in place across their breeding range. New evidence suggests the Appalachian Mountains may act as a migration divide for Interior cormorants, causing some birds to migrate between LMRV and the western Great Lakes, whereas others migrate between Florida and the eastern Great Lakes. Most of the banded cormorants recovered near LMRV aquaculture facilities were banded as nestlings at colonies from the central Great Lakes west to the northern Great Plains. We selected 2 geographically distinct Interior cormorant breeding areas: west of the Great Lakes in Lake of the Woods (LOW) and eastern Lake Ontario (ELO), located on either side of the migration divide in the province of Ontario, Canada, to study population dynamics. We used age-specific classes for our mark-recapture analysis (Program MARK) on data collected from 9,498 color-banded cormorants during the breeding seasons of 2000-2008. Adult survival was the same for both areas (LOW=0.84 +/- 0.09 SE, ELO=0.83 +/- 0.05 SE). Finite rates of population growth () were also similar (LOW=1.01, ELO=0.97) and sensitivity analyses indicated that adult survival was the most influential vital rate contributing to for both breeding areas. However, young-of-the-year survival estimates were distinctly less in ELO (0.19 +/- 0.02 SE) than in LOW (0.45 +/- 0.10 SE) and sensitivity analysis revealed that young-of-the-year survival played a key role in ELO population growth. Moreover, ELO breeding area fidelity (F) was much greater (0.94 +/- 0.05 SE) than the F estimates for all age classes in LOW (between 0.68 +/- 0.19 SE and 0.80 +/- 0.13 SE). Considering these regional demographic differences, we recommend that future management efforts be based on migratory flyways within the Interior population.

However, surface water sources are most exploited, and more certainly the water from rivers. The Litani River has been lately subjected to several aspects of deterioration in its quality. This includes the major physiochemical characteristics. The aims of this study are to assess the seasonal variations in water quality in the Upper Litani River Basin, including the Qaraaoun Lake. The collected samples were from representative sites along the river, and this was carried out at several dates during 2010 and 2011. The carried analysis implies the physical (pH, T degrees, TDS, EC), chemicals (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, NH3+, NO3-, PO42-, K+, Heavy metals. This resulted numeric data are being compared with WHO guidelines. In addition, PCA was applied to evaluate the data accuracy. It can be conclude that the measured variables used are creditable for the assessment.

Primarily due to its high variability and current chemical parameters, the tissue of macrophytes is a more plausible bio-indicator of the load level of metals within lake ecosystems than are water or sediment analyses. The macrophyte, Ceratophyllum demersum, sampled from the Skadar Lake in Montenegro was used as a bio-indicator. Sediments, water and plants were examined for their contents of ten metals in four different periods of 2011. The concentrations of the metals followed the trend: sediment > leaf C. demerswn > stem C. demersum > water. There were differences in the sequences of the metal content in the plant compared to the sequences of their bioaccumulation ability. These differences suggest a different capacity of macrophytes for different metals. The accumulation of Mn was several times higher than the accumulation of the other analyzed metals. The highest ratio of leaf/stem concentrations was recorded for Mn (2.19) and the lowest was for Pb (1.04). The highest contents of Cd, Co, Cr, Pb, V and Sr were found in the tissues of C. demersum at the beginning of the growing season, whereas Ni, Zn, Cu and Mn were found at the end of the vegetative phase.

We conducted an extensive study on the shoreline phytobenthos of Lake Garda (Italy) with the following main objectives: (i) to examine the importance of urbanization for species distribution within a set of hierarchical spatial scales (10(1)-10(4) m), and then (ii) to test the spatio-temporal interactions on a reduced set of scales (10(1)-10(2) m, and 10(1)-10(2) days). Results showed that most of the variation in most abundant species and habitat characteristics occurred at the spatial scale of 10(1)-10(2) m. Species richness was positively related with microheterogeneity, but the relationship occurred only at low urbanization and not at highly-urbanized sites where artificial shores were less heterogeneous. The similarity of species assemblages was regulated by two interacting processes, one operating at a fine spatial scale (10(2) m), reflecting the physical-habitat requirements of the species, and the other one operating at a broader scale (10(4) m) in relation to the N-S nitrogen gradient. Overall, time explained 73 % of the total variation of species assemblages, space 7 %, and 20 % was explained by the interaction between space and time (the patch scale, 10s of m, and area scale, 100s of m, interacted with the finest temporal scale, 10s of days). This interaction might be explained by the process of species recruitment operating at different rates at the two spatial scales. Since the largest variation in species assemblages was at the temporal scale (due to the seasonal succession of phytobenthos), we recommend collecting at least one sample per season when monitoring littoral habitats.					; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018	Cantonati, Marco/0000-0003-0179-3842; Spitale, Daniel/0000-0002-3955-9157													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2014	76	1					17	28		10.1007/s00027-013-0307-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-013-0307-6													WOS:000329226100002

Seasonal Dynamics of Prokaryotic Abundance and Activities in Relation to Environmental Parameters in a Transitional Aquatic Ecosystem (Cape Peloro, Italy)	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												This study examines the effects of temporal changes on microbial parameters in a brackish aquatic ecosystem. To this aim, the abundances of prokaryotes and vibrios together with the rates of enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins by leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), polysaccharides by beta-glucosidase (GLU) and organic phosphates by alkaline phosphatase (AP), heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP), respiration (R), were seasonally investigated, during a 2-year period in the coastal area of Cape Peloro (Messina, Italy), constituted by two brackish lakes (Faro and Ganzirri). In addition, physical and chemical parameters (temperature, salinity, nutrients) and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC, PN) were measured. The influence of multiple factors on prokaryotic abundances and activities was analysed. The results showed that Cape Peloro area is characterised by high seasonal variability of the microbial parameters that is higher than the spatial one. Combined changes in particulate matter and temperature (T), could explain the variability in vibrios abundance, GLU and R activities in both lakes, indicating a direct stimulation of the warm season on the heterotrophic prokaryotic metabolism. Positive correlations between T (from 13.3 to 29.6 A degrees C) and HPP, LAP, AP, POC, PN are also observed in Ganzirri Lake. Moreover, the trophic status index and most of the microbial parameters show significant seasonal differences. This study demonstrates that vibrios abundance and microbial activities are responsive to the spatial and seasonal changes of examined area. The combined effects of temperature and trophic conditions on the microbial parameters lead us to suggest their use as potential indicators of the prokaryotic response to climate changes in temperate brackish areas.					mancuso, monique/AAD-7109-2019; Zaccone, Renata/C-9884-2012; Raffa, Francesco/C-9576-2016; azzaro, maurizio/A-9559-2017; Bergamasco, Alessandro/ABB-5648-2021; azzaro, Maurizio/AAE-6784-2019; Caruso, Gabriella/F-5450-2013	mancuso, monique/0000-0003-3252-0572; Zaccone, Renata/0000-0002-0151-9416; Leonardi, Marcella/0000-0002-8763-6073; Raffa, Francesco/0000-0002-0990-8846; la ferla, rosabruna/0000-0003-1029-7349; Bergamasco, Alessandro/0000-0003-3138-8418; azzaro, maurizio/0000-0001-7885-2340; AZZARO, FILIPPO/0000-0002-5194-3856; Caruso, Gabriella/0000-0002-3819-5486													0095-3628	1432-184X				JAN	2014	67	1					45	56		10.1007/s00248-013-0307-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-013-0307-z								24158689					WOS:000330982500005

The complexity of cormorants: stable isotopes reveal multiple prey sources and feeding site switching	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Conflict between cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.) and humans over fisheries is currently one of the most widespread wildlife management issues in the world. Cormorant impact assessments typically assume a single source of prey near the breeding colony. However, cormorants can fly long distances (>20 km), resulting in fish removal from multiple areas. Knowledge of the source of cormorant prey is critical for fisheries impact assessments. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes values from fish in double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) regurgitations revealed several prey sources for breeding birds in north-central Saskatchewan, Canada. Cormorants also switched feeding locations on a daily and seasonal basis. Foraging patterns inferred by stable isotope analysis closely paralleled observations of relative cormorant densities on different lakes. Up to 80% of prey came from areas well removed from the breeding colony lake (<= 30 km). Cormorant foraging ecology can be complex and may be driven by factors independent of breeding colony site selection. The approach of estimating biomass removal from breeding colony lakes as the guideline for management decisions may be invalid in many locations.

Aquatic macroinvertebrates associated with Eichhornia azurea (Swartz) Kunth and relationships with abiotic factors in marginal lentic ecosystems (Sao Paulo, Brazil)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Marginal lakes are characterised by their having high biological diversity due to the presence of aquatic macrophytes in their coastal zones, providing habitats for refuge and food for animal community members. Among the fauna components associated with macrophytes, aquatic macroinvertebrates are important because they are an energy source for predators and fish. In six lakes and two different seasons (March and August 2009), the ecological attributes of aquatic macroinvertebrate community associated with Eichhornia azurea were compared and the controlling environmental factors were identified. Since the attributes of macroinvertebrate community are strictly associated with abiotic variables of each distinct habitat, our hypothesis was that each site associated with the same floating aquatic macrophyte (E. azurea) should have a typical composition and density of organisms. We identified 50 taxa of macroinvertebrates, with greater taxa richness for aquatic insects (37 taxa) divided into eight orders; the order Diptera being the most abundant in the two study periods. On the other hand, higher values of total taxa richness were recorded in August. Dissolved oxygen and pH presented the greatest number of significant positive correlations with the different taxa. The animals most frequently collected in the six lakes in March and August 2009 were Hirudinea, Oligochaeta, Hydrachnidae, Conchostraca, Ostracoda, Noteridae, Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae, Culicidae, Caenidae, Pleidae, Aeshnidae, Libellulidae, Coenagrionidae and Nematoda. Only densities of Trichoptera, Ostracoda and Conchostraca presented the highest significant differences between lakes in both study periods and considering the composition of macroinvertebrates no significant differences were registered for macroinvertebrate composition.																			1519-6984	1678-4375				FEB	2013	73	1					149	162		10.1590/S1519-69842013000100016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842013000100016								23644797					WOS:000319986800015
J	Scott, D; Jones, B				Scott, Daniel; Jones, Brenda			A regional comparison of the implications of climate change for the golf industry in Canada	CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN												Golf is a recreation industry particularly sensitive to climate, yet the potential implications of climate change for the industry remain largely unexamined. This study presents findings of the first known impact assessment to compare the regional impacts of projected changes in the climate on the golf industry in Canada (or internationally). Empirical relationships between daily rounds played and four weather variables were defined through multiple regression analysis and then used to examine the potential impacts of two climate change scenarios on the length of the golf season and the number of rounds played in three regions of Canada (West Coast, Great Lakes, East Coast). Regionally, the West Coast region was projected to benefit the least from projected climate change, as golf courses that are currently open year round experienced only slight projected increases in rounds played in the 2020s and 2050s. Golf courses in the Great Lakes region could experience a 10- to 51-day longer average golf season and a 27 percent to 3 percent increase in rounds as early as the 2020s, and an even more pronounced increase in the 2050s. East Coast golf courses were projected to benefit the most under both climate change scenarios, experiencing larger gains in average operating seasons (25 to 45 days in the 2020s) and a 40 percent to 48 percent increase in rounds played by as early as the 2020s.					; Scott, Daniel/AAB-6190-2020	Scott, Daniel/0000-0001-7825-9301; 													0008-3658					SUM	2007	51	2					219	232		10.1111/j.1541-0064.2007.00175.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.2007.00175.x													WOS:000247869700007

Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) were found to be at higher concentrations than monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in two seasonal periods. Major fatty acids were palmitic (16:0, 48.5-51.6% of total SFA), oleic (18:1 omega 9, 43.9-50.2% of total MUFA), docosahexaenoic (DHA, 22:6 omega 3, 13.5-27.9% of total PUFA) and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 omega 6. 16.0-19.6% of total PUFA). Polyunsaturated fatty acids were the most abundant in muscle during the flood period, and more especially fatty acids 22:6 omega 3 (10%) and 20:4 omega 6 (7%). There were no significant variations amongst total lipid SFA, MUFA, and PUFA from eye sockets. The omega 6 fatty acid percentages were always higher than the omega 3 fatty acid percentages in tucunare, with omega 6/omega 3 ratios varying between 1.02 and 1.6 in the flood and drought periods.

Thus, this study aims to develop a two-dimensional primary production (PP) model to elucidate phytoplankton biomass and growth rates in Tonle Sap Lake, a large tropical lake-floodplain system in Cambodia. The model consists of three modules of sediment, phosphorus, and phytoplankton, explicitly describing the major processes of phytoplankton (i.e., advection-dispersion, growth, death, sedimentation, and resuspension). As the basis, the hydrological-hydrodynamics model was applied to simulate the tributary river discharges and hydrodynamics of the lake. Then, the PP model was calibrated for the period from November 2016 to July 2018 and validated from August 2018 to June 2019. The root mean square error of the simulated chlorophyll-a concentration was 18.0 mu g/L in the calibration and 10.1 mu g/L in the validation, indicating that the model described the major spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton biomass and productivity in the lake. The PP model revealed that the median specific growth rate and net growth rate in this lake peaked during the low-water period (April - June) when the available dissolved inorganic phosphorus for phytoplankton uptake was higher than in other seasons. The model also allowed the comparison with other lakes regarding phytoplankton productivity, indicating that the specific growth rate of Tonle Sap Lake was in the middle of the rates of other lakes in the world. The developed model substantially helps us understand the phytoplankton productivity in tropical lakefloodplain systems.

Using 21-year data from Bangladesh, we conducted cluster analysis to explore changes in spatial and temporal distribution of cholera incidence since the construction of flood control structures. Striking changes in temporal cluster patterns emerged, including a shift from dry-season to rainy-season clusters following flood protection and delayed clustering inside the protected areas. Spatial differences in pre-flood protection and post-protection cholera clusters are weaker. Changes in spatio-temporal cholera clustering, associated with implementation of flood protection strategies, could affect local cholera prevention efforts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Its effects on ammonia (NH3) volatilization were not clear, especially on farmland scale with crop rotations. In this study, on-farm experiments at the Jiaxing (JX) and Yuhang (YH) sites in Taihu Lake Basin, China were conducted to evaluate the effect of DMPP application on mineral nitrogen (N) (NH4-N and NO3-N) leaching and N It volatilization losses in a rice-rapeseed cropping system. Treatments included urea alone (UA), urea + 1% DMPP (UD), and no fertilizer (CK). The results show that DMPP reduced NO3-N leaching fluxes by 44.9 to 59.9% and increased NH4-N leaching fluxes by 13.0 to 33.3% at two sites during rice and rape seasons compared with urea alone. Reductions in mineral-N leaching fluxes by DMPP in two seasons at the JX and YH sites were 9.5 and 14.3 kg N ha(-1), respectively, compared with UA treatment. The application of DMPP had no significant effects on NH3 volatilization loss fluxes at either site. The rice and rapeseed yields were 5.3 to 7.4% higher in UD plots than in UA plots at two sites. These results that indicate DMPP Could reduce leaching losses of mineral-N from crop fields and promote grain yields by conserving more applied N in soil in rice-rapeseed rotation systems.					li, hua/JYV-5056-2024														0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2009	38	5					2131	2137		10.2134/jeq2008.0476	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2008.0476								19704155					WOS:000269627400036

The two forms differ in an array of morphological traits, including traits associated with predator defense (e. g., spine lengths) and trophic ecology (e. g., number of gill rakers). Mud Lake is only the third lake reported to have anadromous stickleback (which have a complete row of lateral plates) coexisting with low-plated resident stickleback in the absence of intermediate partially plated fish.

A total of 126 cases, reported to the national surveillance system were recruited over 1 y. Controls, selected from the population register,were matched to the cases by age, gender, place of residence and time of infection of the case. Information was gathered by posted questionnaires. Two separate conditional regression models were developed including and excluding 'protective' factors. Two of the factors significantly associated with Campylobacter infection were water-related: having a well in the household (OR = 2.6) and drinking water from a lake/river (OR = 7.4; 6.0). Other exposures associated with increased risk were: having a dog (OR = 8.4; 3.8) and eating grilled meat (OR = 5.5; 2.1). Drinking unpasteurized milk was borderline significant in 1 model (OR = 3.7). Eating sausage was protective (OR = 0.05). Eating chicken was not a significant risk. Exposures such as eating grilled meat and drinking water from a lake or a river were more common in the warm months, a factor that may partly explain the observed seasonality. The authors suggest that differences between risk factors across studies may reflect geographical and age-specific differences in the sources of infection.

J	Fytianos, K; Kotzakioti, A				Fytianos, K; Kotzakioti, A			Sequential fractionation of phosphorus in lake sediments of Northern Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The amounts and forms of potentially mobile P in surface sediments from two lakes, Volvi and Koronia, located in Northern Greece were evaluated using a sequential chemical extraction. Five sedimentary P reservoirs were separately quantified: loosely sorbed P (NH4Cl-P); iron associated P (BD-P); calcium bound P (HCl-P); metal oxide bound P (NaOH-P) and residual P (organic and refractory P). Samples were taken in two seasons and the average concentration of the fractions of phosphorus were calculated. The results indicated that the TP content and chemically extractable phosphorus in the sediments of Koronia Lake were higher than those of Volvi Lake. Sediment TP was also strongly and positively correlated with sediment Fe. Fine-sized sediments exhibited significantly higher concentrations for both lakes than the sand fraction. The P in the surface sediment mainly consisted of HCl-P and Res-P, while NH4Cl-P and BD-P only constituted a minor part. The rank order of the different P extracts was the same for the two lakes and was Residual-P > HCl-P > NaOH-P > BD-P > NH4Cl-P.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2005	100	1-3					191	200		10.1007/s10661-005-4770-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-005-4770-y								15727307					WOS:000226970300013
J	Rowell, DP; Berthou, S				Rowell, David P. P.; Berthou, Segolene			Fine-Scale Climate Projections: What Additional Fixed Spatial Detail Is Provided by a Convection-Permitting Model?	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Convection-permitting (CP) models promise much in response to the demand for increased localization of future climate information: greater resolution of influential land surface characteristics, improved representation of convective storms, and unprecedented resolution of user-relevant data. In practice, however, it is contended that the benefits of enhanced resolution cannot be fully realized due to the gap between models' computational and effective resolution. Nevertheless, where surface forcing is strongly heterogeneous, one can argue that usable information may persist close to the grid scale. Here we analyze a 4.5-km resolution CP projection for Africa, asking whether and where fine-scale projection detail is robust at sub-25-km scales, focusing on geolocated rainfall features (rather than Lagrangian motion). Statistically significant detail for seasonal means and daily extremes is most frequent in regions of high topographic variability, most prominently in East Africa throughout the annual cycle, West Africa in the monsoon season, and to a lesser extent over Southern Africa. Lake coastal features have smaller but significant impacts on projection detail, whereas ocean coastlines and urban conurbations have little or no detectable impact. The amplitude of this sub-25-km projection detail can be similar to that of the local climatology in mountainous regions (or around a third near East Africa's lake shores), so potentially beneficial for improved localization of future climate information. In flatter regions distant from coasts (the majority of Africa), spatial heterogeneity can be explained by chaotic weather variability. Here, the robustness of local climate projection information can be substantially enhanced by spatial aggregation to approximately 25-km scales, especially for daily extremes and equatorial regions. Significance StatementRecent substantial increases in the horizontal resolution of climate models bring the potential for both more reliable and more local future climate information. However, the best spatial scale on which to analyze such data for impacts assessments remains unclear. We examine a 4.5-km resolution climate projection for Africa, focusing on seasonal and daily rainfall. Spatially fixed fine-scale projection detail is found to be statistically robust at sub-25-km scales in the most mountainous regions and to a lesser extent along lake coastlines. Elsewhere, the model data may be better aggregated to at least 25-km scales to reduce sampling uncertainties. Such evolving guidance on the circumstances and extent of high-resolution data aggregation will help users gain greater benefit from climate model projections.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				FEB 15	2023	36	4					1229	1246		10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0009.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-22-0009.1													WOS:000928884200012

Adaptations of fish species to oxygen depletion in a central Amazonian floodplain lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Pronounced seasonal and daily oxygen concentration changes are characteristic for Amazonian floodplain lakes. Studies on the fish fauna of the Lago Camaleao, Solimoes River, Amazonas, Brazil, showed several fish species which are able to survive prolonged periods of heavy hypoxia. Twenty species belonging to eight families were observed in the laboratory in order to determine their respiratory adaptations to hypoxic conditions and oxygen concentrations at which the fish present respiratory adaptations. Finally, the fish species were distributed throughout the habitats of Lake Camaleao according to their adaptation responses. Ten fish species used the surface water for aquatic surface respiration, four species used atmospheric oxygen for aerial respiration, four species used oxygen supplied by the exudation of the roots of floating macrophytes and two exhibited a high tolerance to hypoxic conditions, and well-developed physiological biochemical mechanisms. The fish fauna is well adapted to low oxygen concentrations. The large variety of morpho-anatomical adaptations associated with biochemical and physiological mechanisms to tolerate hypoxic and anoxic conditions enable the 20 fish species to exploit several habitats of Lago Camaleao, such as floating aquatic macrophyte meadows, open water and near the shoreline.

Many studies reported that great cormorants may impact fish populations not only by consuming large number of individuals but also by wounding them. Most studies regarded fish farms and cultured species, but there is less information about wild fish populations. In this study, we examined the incidence of wounds caused by great cormorants on an endemic and threatened species, the Cisalpine pike (Esox cisalpinus Bianco and Delmastro 2011). The object of our research was to quantify this impact and indirectly to estimate if cormorant predation may be one of the causes of the rapid decline of this Esocidae. In the years 2009-2013, 139 pikes were collected in some gravel pits in Northwestern Italy. More than a half of the specimens (57 %) reported wounds attributable to great cormorant attacks. Most wounds were localized in the dorsal and lateral surfaces of pikes. We detected a significant difference in the occurrence of wounds between fish sizes, with 73.5 % of adults showing some kind of injury. In a context of general freshwater habitat alteration, quarry lakes represent important sites for Cisalpine pike conservation. Unfortunately, pike breeding season overlaps with the presence of large colonies of overwintering cormorants, increasing the probability of interactions in a period of extreme importance for this Esocidae. Our data evidenced that the increase of cormorants represents an important menace for Cisalpine pike conservation. Finally, we suggest some management options to minimize the problem.					; Fenoglio, Stefano/G-5382-2012	Boano, Giovanni/0000-0002-2670-4351; 													1612-4642	1439-0574				OCT	2015	61	5					743	748		10.1007/s10344-015-0951-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-015-0951-3													WOS:000361649600010

This study describes the pattern of seasonal and spatial variation of physico-chemical and biological variables during the years 2009 and 2010 at nine points, representing part of northern, central and southern regions. Water quality was evaluated by applying the trophic state index (TSI) and the water quality index (WQI), and classes according to CONAMA Resolution 357/2005. Samples of benthic invertebrates were collected and determined the biotic index (BI), following the models of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA-USA), and adaptation of Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP). The results demonstrated a system with high turbidity and phosphorus content, and low N:P ratio, and with little seasonal and spatial changes in the measured variables. Although the results of WQI and the CONAMA have classified the lagoon waters with excellent to good quality, the results of the TSI and the BI were opposites, classifying the ecosystem as amended and polluted system. It is concluded that these indices should be readjusted through systematic evaluations in order to reflect the quality condition of aquatic ecosystems in rural areas in the subtropical region of Brazil.

Methods and Results: E. coli and enterococci were enumerated in gull faeces by membrane filtration. E. coli genotypes (rep-PCR genomic profiles) and E. coli (Vitek(R) GNI+) and enterococci (API(R) rapid ID 32 Strep and resistance to streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline and ampicillin) phenotypes were determined for isolates obtained from gull faeces both early and late in the swimming season. Identical E. coli genotypes were obtained only from single gull faecal samples but most faecal samples yielded more than one genotype (median of eight genotypes for samples with 10 isolates). E. coli isolates from the same site that clustered at greater than or equal to85% similarity were from the same sampling date and shared phenotypic characteristics, and at this similarity level there was population overlap between the two geographically isolated beach sites. Enterococcus API(R) profiles varied with sampling date. Gull enterococci displayed wide variation in antibiotic resistance patterns, and high-level resistance to some antibiotics. Conclusions: Gull faeces could be a major contributor of E. coli (10(5)-10(9) CFU g(-1)) and enterococci (10(4)-10(8) CFU g(-1)) to Great Lakes recreational waters. E. coli and enterococci in gull faeces are highly variable with respect to their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics and may exhibit temporal or geographic trends in these features. Significance and Impact of the Study: The high degree of variation in genotypic or phenotypic characteristics of E. coli or enterococci populations within gull hosts will require extensive sampling for adequate characterization, and will influence methods that use these characteristics to determine faecal contamination sources for recreational waters.																			1364-5072	1365-2672					2003	94	5					865	878		10.1046/j.1365-2672.2003.01910.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.2003.01910.x								12694452					WOS:000182188300013

Seasonal variations in gross primary productivity (GPP) (g C m(-2) day(-1)), net primary productivity (NPP, respiration (R), and the NPP/R ratio have been studied and compared with hydrobiological factors. Among various factors, temperature, light, nutrients, and chlorophyll a were accountable for high productivity. Nygaard's trophic state indices were calculated. GPP showed a positive relationship with water temperature, penetration of light, nitrate, and with phosphate. The extensive range of the compound index observed in Rewalsar (12.00-20.00) and Kuntbhyog lakes (12.50-18.00) confirmed their eutrophic nature. Based on the trophic classification of waters and on the basis of productivity, Nygaard's trophic state indices, and richness of nutrients, Rewalsar and Kuntbhyog lakes could be categorized as eutrophic, whereas Prashar Lake, as oligo-eutrophic. Based on the presence, absence, frequency of appearance, and abundance of different organisms recorded during the present investigation, bioindicators of trophic status have been determined.					; Sharma, Dixit/D-5463-2018; Kumar, Rakesh/CAI-6813-2022; Sharma, Amit/AAR-3507-2021	Kumar, Rakesh/0000-0002-8814-7108; Sharma, Dixit/0000-0002-9911-9364; Kulharia, Mahesh/0000-0002-4633-4407; THAKUR, KUSHAL/0000-0003-3801-4531; Sharma, Dr. Ankita/0000-0003-1360-5810														2296-665X				FEB 8	2023	11								1009942	10.3389/fenvs.2023.1009942	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1009942													WOS:000936400800001

In the center of the Amazon River basin, muddy white water of the Amazon River meets with black water of the Negro River, creating a conspicuous visible boundary spanning over 10km along the Amazon River. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the confluence boundary between the white and black water rivers concentrates prey and is used as a feeding habitat for consumers by investigating the density, biomass and distribution of mesozooplankton and ichthyoplankton communities across the two rivers during the rainy season. Our results show that mean mesozooplankton density (2,730 inds. m(-3)) and biomass (4.8 mg m(-3)) were higher in the black-water river compared to the white-water river (959 inds. m(-3); 2.4 mg m(-3)); however an exceptionally high mesozooplankton density was not observed in the confluence boundary. Nonetheless we found the highest density of ichthyoplankton in the confluence boundary (9.7 inds. m(-3)), being up to 9-fold higher than in adjacent rivers. The confluence between white and black waters is sandwiched by both environments with low (white water) and high (black water) zooplankton concentrations and by both environments with low (white water) and high (black water) predation pressures for fish larvae, and may function as a boundary layer that offers benefits of both high prey concentrations and low predation risk. This forms a plausible explanation for the high density of ichthyoplankton in the confluence zone of black and white water rivers.

Our results showed that bacterial production (BP) was lower and more variable than bacterial respiration, determined as total respiration. Bacterial carbon demand was mostly accounted by BR and presented the same pattern that BR in both water phases. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) showed a wide range (0.2 -23%) and low mean value of 3 and 6%, (in HW and LW, respectively) suggesting that dissolved organic carbon was mostly allocated to catabolic metabolism. However, BGE was regulated by BP in LW phase. Consequently, changes in BGE showed the same pattern that BP. In addition, the hydrological pulse effects on mainstems and floodplains lakes connectivity were found for BP and BGE in LW. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that indexes of organic matter (OM) quality (chlorophyll-a, N stable isotopes and C/N ratios) were the strongest seasonal drivers of bacterial carbon metabolism. Our work indicated that: (i) the bacterial metabolism was mostly driven by respiration in Amazonian aquatic ecosystems resulting in low BGE in either high or LW phase; (ii) the hydrological pulse regulated the bacterial heterotrophic metabolism between Amazonian mainstems and floodplain lakes mostly driven by OM quality.					; Abril, Gwenaël/C-7835-2011; Moreira-Turcq, Patricia/IYT-2754-2023; Roland, Fabio/C-7918-2013; Vidal, Luciana/V-4819-2019; Benedetti, Marc/A-5463-2011; Artigas, Luis/L-1264-2016; Tornisielo, Valdemar/C-4343-2012; Bernardes, Marcelo/H-7869-2012; Reis, Mariana/AAC-4225-2021; Benedetti, Marc F./A-5463-2011; de Melo, Michaela/AAE-6608-2019; Lobao, Lucia/AAF-8188-2021	Artigas, Luis Felipe/0000-0003-0512-5315; Camara dos Reis, Mariana/0000-0003-4887-5351; de Melo, Michaela/0000-0002-8545-4153; Abril, Gwenael/0000-0002-4914-086X; Moreira-Turcq, Patricia/0000-0003-4299-2768; Bernardes, Marcelo/0000-0002-4338-4353; Benedetti, Marc F./0000-0003-1075-8205; 													1664-302X					SEP 30	2015	6								1054	10.3389/fmicb.2015.01054	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01054								26483776					WOS:000363374900001

There is a substantial lack of studies into the behavior of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the intensively managed agroecosystem. A 3-year in situ field experiment was conducted to determine DON leaching and its seasonal and yearly variations as affected by fertilization, irrigation and precipitation over 6 consecutive rice/wheat seasons. Under the conventional N practice (300 kg N ha(-1) for rice and 200 kg N ha(-1) for wheat), the seasonal average DON concentrations in leachate (100 cm soil depth) for the three rice and wheat seasons were 0.6-1.1 and 0.1-2.3 mg N L-1, respectively. The cumulative DON leaching was estimated to be 1.1-2.3 kg N ha(-1) for the rice seasons and 0.01-1.3 kg N ha(-1) for the wheat seasons, with an annual total of 1.1-3.6 kg N ha(-1). In the rice seasons, N fertilizer had little effect (P > 0.05) on DON leaching; precipitation and irrigation imported 3.6-9.1 kg N ha(-1) of DON, which may thus conceal the fertilization effect on DON. In the wheat seasons, N fertilization had a positive effect (P < 0.01) on DON. Nevertheless, this promotive effect was strongly influenced by variable precipitation, which also carried 1.8-2.9 kg N ha(-1) of DON into fields. Despite a very small proportion to chemical N applied and large variations driven by water regime, DON leaching is necessarily involved in the integrated field N budget in the rice-wheat rotation due to its relatively greater amount compared to other natural ecosystems.

J	Mengel, MA				Mengel, Martin A.			Cholera in Africa: new momentum in fighting an old problem	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												Cholera remains a grave public health problem in Africa. It is endemic with seasonal variations around the central African Great Lakes. Along the coasts, it occurs mostly in rapidly expanding epidemics, with intercalated 3-5 year lull-periods. Case-fatality ratios remain high at 2-5% against the global declining trend. Insufficient safe water and sanitation coverage are the main causes of persistent cholera in Africa and this is unlikely to improve soon. However, an efficacious oral cholera vaccine is now available and new groups and initiatives like the African Cholera Surveillance Network (Africhol) allow countries to enhance their capacities for an integrated cross-border approach using all means necessary to tackle cholera in Africa.																			0035-9203	1878-3503				JUL	2014	108	7					391	392		10.1093/trstmh/tru077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/tru077								24836060					WOS:000338134700003
J	Taher, AG				Taher, Amany G.			Formation and calcification of modern gypsum-dominated stromatolites, EMISAL, Fayium, Egypt	FACIES												Recent gypsum stromatolites are forming along the margin as well as on the pond floor of the EMISAL saltworks, Fayium, Egypt. Gypsum precipitates are classified according to their morphology, fabrics, and crystal size into (1) subaqueous bottom gypsum crusts, (2) selenitic gypsum facies, (3) stromatolitic gypsum dome facies, and (4) gypsolite facies. Two types of microbial mats, lithifying and non-lithifying, can be identified. The lithifying mat is shallow and composed of an alternation of gypsum and microbial layers that are seasonally controlled. The non-lithifying mat, formed in the deeper part of the pond, is a greenish-brown slime-rich layer that exhibits a frothy macro texture and produces a firm gelatinous film covering the sediment surface. Calcium carbonate (mostly aragonite) particles, identified by light and scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction occur within the deeper part of the lithified mat and are associated with living and degrading biofilm. Precipitation of aragonite is associated with the dissolution of gypsum, which may have resulted from bacterial sulphate reduction. The latter process increases alkalinity and ultimately results in the replacement of gypsum by aragonite.																			0172-9179	1612-4820				JUL	2014	60	3					721	735		10.1007/s10347-014-0405-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10347-014-0405-5													WOS:000337344100001

Climatic warming, sex ratios, and red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) in Illinois	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												Sex ratios for hatchlings and adult turtles collected in aquatic habitats were examined for red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) collected at Long Lake in west-central Illinois. We found that sex ratios were initially balanced but became progressively more male biased with the passage of time. Large cohorts of newly recruited males seem to underlie the increasing male bias. Recruitment more than doubled between 2001 and 2004, and these turtles were strongly male biased. Climatic warming may have led to the current male bias. A period of warming at the site has allowed females to lay more eggs by lengthening the nesting season. Females are laying an extra clutch, which accounts for the increased recruitment. This clutch is laid when soil temperatures are relatively low, explaining the male bias in newly recruited turtles. The impact of the increased number of male turtles on the population is uncertain. However, female condition declined about 7% between 1994 and 2006, suggesting that an effect may be occurring.																			1071-8443					AUG	2008	7	1					60	69		10.2744/CCB-0670.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2744/CCB-0670.1													WOS:000258608800009
J	Reimchen, TE; Nosil, P				Reimchen, TE; Nosil, P			Variable predation regimes predict the evolution of sexual dimorphism in a population of threespine stickleback	EVOLUTION												Sexual dimorphism is widespread in nature and can be influenced by sex-specific natural selection resulting from ecological differences between the sexes. Here we show that contrasting life-history pressures and temporal shifts in ecology can exert a strong influence on the evolution of sexual dimorphism. The bony spines exhibited by stickleback are a defense against open-water avian predators but may be detrimental against benthic macroinvertebrate predators. Female stickleback from a coastal lake in western Canada occupy a more open-water ecological niche and exhibit greater dorsal and pelvic spine number than males, but the magnitude of these differences varies among life-history stages, seasons, and years. Ecological data on diet and parasite load and 62 seasonal estimates of selection over a 15-year period show that selection favors increased spine number in females and decreased spine number in males, but only when pronounced ecological differences between the sexes results in differential exposure to the two, divergent predation regimes. Thus occasional sex-reversals in ecological niche reversed the mode of selection. These processes caused a predictable response in the subsequent generation, indicating that divergent predation caused evolutionary change in dimorphism. However, temporal oscillations in sex-specific selection resulted in no net change in sexual dimorphism over the 15-year study period, indicating that fluctuations in directional selection can be responsible for long-term stasis. Replicated shifts in selective regime can demonstrate the primacy of ecological processes in driving evolution and our results illustrate how such shifts are detectable using long-term monitoring of natural populations.

In this paper, a coupled mathematical model of heat and moisture transfer was constructed for freeze-thaw soils to investigate the long-term thermal regimes of subgrade beneath a drainage channel built on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Based on the numerical simulations, the thermal regimes of the subgrade both in warm and cold seasons were analyzed within a period of 50 years, as well as the impact of the widths of the channel. The results showed that the channel excavation and flowing water within could lead to a significant underlying permafrost degradation. During the first 30 years, the permafrost beneath the channel mainly experienced a rapid downward degradation. After that, the lateral thermal erosion of the flowing water led to a rapid permafrost degradation beneath the slope of the channel. In cold seasons, the shallow ground beneath the channel would not refreeze due to the flowing water and the thaw bulb actually expanded throughout the year. For the channel with a bottom width of 15 m, the thaw bulb beneath the channel could expand laterally to the natural ground about 10 m far away from the slope shoulder of channel till the 50th year. With different widths, the long-term thermal regimes of the subgrade beneath the channels differed considerably and the maximum difference was at the slope toe of the embankment. With the numerical simulated results, it is recommended that a channel built on permafrost should be wide-and-shallow rather than narrow-and-deep if conditions permit.

Coarse- and fine-scale patterns of distribution and habitat selection places an Amazonian floodplain curassow in double jeopardy	PEERJ												Patterns of habitat selection are influenced by local productivity, resource availability, and predation risk. Species have taken millions of years to hone the macro- and microhabitats they occupy, but these may now overlap with contemporary human threats within natural species ranges. Wattled Curassow (Crax globulosd), an endemic galliform species of the western Amazon, is threatened by both hunting and habitat loss, and is restricted to white-water floodplain forests of major Amazonian rivers. In this study conducted along the Jurua River, Amazonas, Brazil, we quantified the ranging ecology and fine-scale patterns of habitat selection of the species. We estimated the home range size of C. globulosa using conventional VHF telemetry. To estimate patterns of habitat selection, we used geo-locations of day ranges to examine the extent and intensity of use across the floodplain, which were then compared to a high-resolution flood map of the study area. We captured two females and one male, which we monitored for 13 months between September 2014 and September 2015. Average home range size was 283 ha, based on the 95% aLoCoH estimator. Wattled Curassows selected areas of prolonged flood pulses (six to eight months/year) and had a consistent tendency to be near open water, usually in close proximity to river banks and lakes, especially during the dry season. Amazonian floodplains are densely settled, and the small portions of floodplain habitat used by Wattled Curassows are both the most accessible to hunters and most vulnerable to deforestation. As a result, the geographic and ecological distribution of Wattled Curassows places them at much higher extinction risk at multiple spatial scales, highlighting the need to consider habitat preferences within their conservation strategy.

Home range and movements of radio-tracked estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) within a non-tidal waterhole	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												We radio-tracked five male and eight female estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in a non-tidal water-hole in Lakefield National Park in northern Queensland during the late dry/mid-wet season (2003-04) and the following dry season (2004). Individual crocodiles occupied larger home ranges (River Channel Areas (RCA) during the late dry/midwet season (10.64 +/- 2.86 ha) than in the dry season (3.20 +/- 1.02 ha), and males occupied larger home ranges (23.89 +/- 2.36 ha) than females (5.94 +/- 1.34 ha) during the late dry/mid-wet season. There were no obvious differences in home range between sexes during the dry season. During the late dry/mid-wet season, adult males often travelled long distances along the waterhole while females moved less. During the dry season, movement patterns were quite variable, with no clear difference between sexes. All crocodiles were most active from late afternoon (1500-1800 hours) until midnight. Individual home ranges (RCA) overlapped considerably during the late dry/mid-wet season. The extent of home-range overlap between three adult males and the number of times they either passed each other or were located near each other was particularly striking. Previous research has come to conflicting conclusions about the extent of territoriality in wild estuarine crocodiles, although it has been widely believed that males are highly territorial. The findings imply that large adult male estuarine crocodiles are not highly territorial in non-tidal freshwater systems that are geographically confined.

The lakes are located along an altitudinal gradient and were sampled at a biweekly resolution from May through October, 2002. In general, we found later onset and weaker lake stratification under colder climates. Lake circulation and SiO2 are strongly correlated and together significantly explain the distribution of diatoms of the individual lakes. Diatoms that accumulated in the sediment traps were mostly composed of benthic species, suggesting resuspension. However, diatom flux and lake circulation were not significantly correlated, the diatom assemblages in the sediment traps were similar in two consecutive years, and species-environment relationships were comparable among lakes, which indicates that the effects of resuspension were minimal. In addition, we found that one lake was more productive due to forest logging. The forest in the catchment of Lake Maxi was entirely clear-cut shortly prior to our sampling. Mean total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher when compared to the other five study lakes. This study seeks to improve our understanding of how diatoms in boreal lakes respond to climate change and forest clear-cut.					; Hausmann, Sonja/E-5152-2011	Pienitz, Reinhard/0000-0002-3613-1673; Hausmann, Sonja/0000-0002-5411-5298; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2009	635	1					1	14		10.1007/s10750-009-9855-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9855-0													WOS:000270652200001

The complexity of LoW basins, shoreline extent, and underlying geology (situated on both the Canadian Shield and Glacial Lake Agassiz Lakebed sediments) creates variable water quality conditions, with cyanobacterial and harmful algal blooms (cHABs) particularly prevalent in the southern basins. We used a multivariate approach to differentiate basins within LoW, to better understand potential mechanisms underlying eutrophication and cHAB development. A unique signature of redox-sensitive metals was observed above the lakebed suggesting differential impacts of diffusive flux and resuspension dynamics, with significantly different micronutrient signatures between locations on vs off the Canadian Shield. The basins on the Glacial Lake Agassiz lakebed including Big Traverse, Little Traverse, Morson and Bishop were statistically comparable (p > 0.05), and significantly different from those on the Canadian Shield (p < 0.05). Correlations between bio-relevant element vanadium (element potentially used in nitrogen fixation) and chlorophyll-a), suggest potential elemental drivers of cyanobacterial ecology in LoW. An integration of multi-disciplinary research may serve to better address water quality issues as they relate to underlying geology and improve monitoring programs into the future to further delineate the physical-biogeochemical processes differentially impacting basins within LoW.

J	Finkelstein, DB; Pratt, LM; Curtin, TM; Brassell, SC				Finkelstein, DB; Pratt, LM; Curtin, TM; Brassell, SC			Wildfires and seasonal aridity recorded in Late Cretaceous strata from south-eastern Arizona, USA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Lithostratigraphic and organic chemostratigraphic studies of fluvial/lacustrine sediments in the Late Cretaceous Fort Crittenden Formation in south-eastern Arizona USA, reveal changes in palaeoclimate and tectonics as well as associated fluctuations in lake level. The lower Fort Crittenden is dominated by marginal wetland to deep-water lake deposits, whereas the upper Fort Crittenden is characterized by wetland to deltaic deposits. Abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and reflectance of fusinite substantiate the impact of wildfires within the watershed. Organic geochemical evidence of wildfires is linked with sedimentological indicators of seasonal aridity suggesting that wildfires were common occurrences. Sedimentological evidence for seasonal aridity includes mottles and pseudoslickensides on ped structures within wetland mudstones. Distinct variations in PAH assemblages, characterized by the number of aromatic rings, indicate that there were variations in the intensities of wildfires, assuming no variations in the types of fuel. Fusinite reflectance values are consistent with combustion temperatures from 470 to 550 degrees C observed in modern wildfires.

J	Tan, CP; Plink-Björklund, P				Tan, Chengpeng; Plink-Bjorklund, Piret			Morphodynamics of supercritical flow in a linked river and delta system, Daihai Lake, Northern China	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Historically, the occurrence of Froude supercritical flow and preservation of its deposits was considered rare in natural systems. Over recent years, a growing body of evidence indicates that Froude supercritical flow is a significant formative flow across the terrestrial and marine landscapes, and responsible for much of the sedimentary record from rivers to deepwater systems. This riverbank, trench, ground penetrating radar and modern riverbed dataset from the Bantanzi stream in the Daihai Lake basin, northern China, documents a linked river and delta succession dominated by sedimentary structures formed by supercritical flow. This study links the sedimentary structures in river deposits to modern bedforms in the dry riverbed, and discusses how the sedimentary structures and the supercritical flow morphodynamics change from the river to the delta front. In addition to well-known decimetre to metre-scale sedimentary structures produced by supercritical flow in the river deposits, centimetre-scale sedimentary structures were found on the delta front that were quantitatively linked to deposition from cyclic step migration, utilizing a theoretical framework. This work further documents two types of clinoform geometries in delta foresets. One of these clinoform geometries is consistent with deltaic processes controlled by hydraulic jumps at the river mouth, and the other with hydraulic jumps at the base of delta foresets. Comparison with flume experiments and quantitative assessment show that ephemeral rivers, like the Bantanzi stream, are likely to produce supercritical flow also on their delta fronts, and link the supercritical flow occurrences to the highly seasonal and intense monsoon precipitation in this semi-arid region. This work sheds light on current fundamental understanding of sediment transport and deposition processes from river to delta and highlights the effect of cyclic steps in these processes.					; Plink-Bjorklund, Piret/AAF-2936-2019	Tan, Chengpeng/0000-0002-6877-290X; Plink-Bjorklund, Piret/0000-0003-1637-2100													0037-0746	1365-3091				JUN	2021	68	4			SI		1606	1639		10.1111/sed.12839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12839		FEB 2021											WOS:000615792500001

Paleofloristic comparison of the Ayuquila and Otlaltepec basins, Middle Jurassic, Oaxaca, Mexico	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The evolution of the Jurassic sedimentary basins is a topic that has recently begun to be studied in Mexico. The aspects investigated to date involve the formation, size, origin and weathering of the sediments through the deposit, amongst others. However, so far, they have not been related to the plant communities that were established during the phases of basinal evolution. In this paper we compare the paleofloristic listings and vegetation structure of two communities that developed in the Ayuquila and Otlaltepec basins, with the characteristics of the deposit environments reported for each basin that were deposited during the Bajocian-Bathonian. For the Ayuquila basin, alluvial fans are reported combined with flood plains and isolated lakes within a braided river system. While for the Otlaltepec basin the presence of braided river is inferred. The moisture available for each plant community was estimated by the use of seven foliar classes. The vegetation structure was obtained through the identification of leaves, reproductive structures and fossilized wood at the species level; these data allowed the quantification of plant diversity of the communities, which in the Ayuquila basin amounts to 14 genera and 22 species, while in the Otlaltepec basin nine genera and 22 species were identified, which formed plant communities with three well-defined strata. The herbaceous stratum in both basins was made up of Pteridophytes. In the Ayuquila basin they are represented by the genera Equisetum and Cladophlebis, while in the Otlaltepec basin only by Filicales. In the Ayuquila basin, Cladophiebis sp and Otozamites hespera are the most abundant species, while in the Otlaltepec basin it was Zamites lucerensis. In both basins the foliar area exhibited by the floristic elements mostly correspond to microphyll I or smaller leaves, which correspond to Brachyphyllum and to different genera of Bennettitales. Of these latter plants only Otozamites hespera and Zamites lucerensis are considered generalists as they are present in the four localities that comprise the study area. Finally, the lithological characteristics of the watersheds of Ayuquila and Otlaltepec indicate the presence of ephemeral or permanent bodies of water that vary in volume according to the season of the year these provided the necessary humidity for the establishment of ferns and members of Pelourdea, organisms considered ripary or seasonal. While in the dry season the members of Coniferales (Brachyphyllum), Bennettitales and perhaps Caytoniales (Sagenopteris) were favored.

Experiments using different nutrient (N, P and Si) manipulations were performed in 10-1 enclosures for 48 h. Changes in chlorophyll a concentrations, inorganic nutrient concentrations, and plankton cell density were monitored. Results revealed that phytoplankton development in the lagoon is strongly affected by ambient physical factors (wind, temperature). Nutrient limitation, however, also plays an important role in seasonal succession mechanisms showing quite distinct seasonal development patterns. Based on the data, available phytoplankton seasonal succession in the Curonian lagoon could be described as composed by three phases corresponding to different domination and regulatory mechanisms.

Understanding the hydrological connectivity and its dynamics in the TSR, including its floodplain, is therefore important to support activities that aim to maintain ecological services in the TSR-TSL system. Thus, the main objective of this study is to examine the hydrological connectivity of the TSR and its floodplain by a modelling approach that integrates inundation patterns and sediment dynamics. The Caesar-Lisflood model was applied to describe inundation, sediment erosion, transport, and deposition in the TSR for the period of 2003-2013. The inundation areas connected to the TSR ranged from 140 to 2,327 km(2), whereas the isolated inundation areas from the TSR ranged from 0.27 to 504 km(2). Sediment dynamics showed its influence on inundation patterns and hydrological connectivity and could alter the yearly inundation ratio (defined as a normalized inundation frequency with a value ranging from 0 to 1) up to 0.8. Our approach provides a quantitative way to determine key factors (e.g., total inundation areas, seasonality, and connectivity of inundation patterns) for further investigation of ecological processes in relation to the inundation patterns and sediment dynamics in the TSR and TSL.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				NOV	2019	35	9					1387	1401		10.1002/rra.3491	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3491		JUL 2019											WOS:000478236900001

Seasonal changes and spatial variation in the water quality of a eutrophic tropical reservoir determined by the inflowing river. Lake Reserv Manage. 27:343-354. The water quality of a eutrophic tropical reservoir was studied over a 5-year period (2000-2004), with quarterly sampling (Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct) carried out at 3 sampling stations with one station in each of 3 zones (fluvial, transitional, and lacustrine). During the wet season, large amounts of phosphorus were introduced into the reservoir by the increased inflow of the river. Dissolved oxygen, pH, and chlorophyll a levels peaked in the wet season; pH, chlorophyll a, and total phosphorus in several cases were recorded above the recommended Brazilian guidelines. Dissolved oxygen was lower than acceptable levels in the euphotic layer and reached very low levels in the hypolimnion, indicating thermal stratification. Efficient reservoir management is necessary to restore environmental quality, and our results indicate that selective withdrawal may be an effective means of improving the quality of water in Funil Reservoir.

To better understand the ecology of wild and stocked fry, we investigated the dispersal, growth, and food composition of advanced pike fry (similar to 30 mm) stocked at a high density at a common release site in a shallow natural lake that contained wild young-of- the-year (age-0) pike. The stocked pike fry colonized the entire lake shoreline within just a few days. Dispersal was inversely related to size at stocking, suggesting that smaller fish were displaced by competitively superior larger individuals. While the stocked pike were initially larger than the wild age-0 pike, suboptimal growth was evident among the stocked pike and they were smaller than the wild ones at the end of the growing season. Stomach analyses revealed that the stocked pike ingested less diverse prey items and had higher fractions of empty stomachs throughout the study period. Overall, the fraction of stocked pike in samples rapidly declined over the season, which may have been caused by differential survival or immigration into or emigration out of the study system. Our study adds to the existing literature suggesting that the stocking of age-0 northern pike into waters with naturally reproducing pike populations will result in limited success. We propose two potentially complementary explanations for the apparent low fitness of stocked individuals in competition with wild conspecifics: (1) genetic-based local maladaptation among the stocked fish and (2) carryover effects from the hatchery. The latter may be less likely because the fry stocked were the offspring of wild fish and only spent a few weeks in the hatchery.

Altogether, 11 lakes were surveyed and the total number of stations with concurrent remote sensing and limnological measurements was 127. The ranges of the water quality variables were: the sum of chlorophyll a and phaeophytin a 1-100 mug l(-1), turbidity 0.4-26 FNU, total suspended solids 0.7-32 mg l(-1). absorption coefficient of aquatic humus at 400 nm 1.2-14 m(-1) and secchi disc transparency 0.4-7 m, For the retrieval analyses, 24 AISA channels in the 450-786 nm range with a channel width of 6-14 nm were used. The agreement between estimated and observed water quality variables M;as generally good and R-2 for the best algorithms was in the range of 0.72-0.90 over the whole dataset. The channels used for May were, in most cases, the same as those for August, but the empirical parameters of the algorithms were different. After seasonal grouping, R-2 varied from 0.84 to 0.95. The use of apparent reflectance: instead of radiance improved the estimation of water quality in the case of total suspended solids and turbidity. In the most humic lake, the empirical algorithms tested were suitable only fur the interpretation of total suspended solids and turbidity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, many current simulations consider heat flow in only one-dimension (1D) and thus cannot represent two or three-dimensional effects. To address this issue, we use fine-scale in situ measurements and two-dimension (2D) heat conduction simulations and compare the simulated ground thermal evolution and degradation of island permafrost to a 1D simulation. The 2D simulation reasonably represented seasonal and interannual features of the ground thermal regime, such as temperature profile, thawing/frozen depth, and permafrost body width. Lateral thawing of the island permafrost was dominant, and was about one order of magnitude greater than the modelled vertical thaw. In the vertical direction, downward permafrost thaw caused by increase in air temperature rise was restricted by phase change of ground ice near the permafrost table during the simulation period, contributing little to the overall permafrost degradation. Rates of permafrost degradation in the 1D simulation were 1.6-1.8 times lower than the simulation considering lateral heat fluxes. The field monitoring and numerical simulation highlight the importance of coupling lateral heat transfer in permafrost models.					peng, xiaoqing/ABE-1509-2021; Yao, Yingying/AAK-9395-2021; Fan, Chengyan/KBD-2130-2024; Zhang, Tingjun/GWB-9359-2022; Cao, Bin/AAH-7172-2019	wang, shengdi/0000-0003-0823-869X; Fan, Chengyan/0000-0002-2601-2531; Clow, Gary/0000-0002-2262-3853; Cao, Bin/0000-0003-2473-2276													0016-7061	1872-6259				FEB	2023	430								116330	10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116330		JAN 2023											WOS:000963007500001

Here, we monitored the spawning-related movements and redds occurrence of transported semi-wild and hatchery-reared salmon in the restored River Ala-Koitajoki, eastern Finland, using radiotelemetry and snorkeling. Nearly all fish accepted the newly restored spawning habitats in the river that maintains a low flow rate (only 4 m(3).s(-1)). The movements of females released up to 2 weeks before spawning time were restricted mainly to the closest rapids from the release site, and most of the movements were directed downstream. Semi-wild and hatchery background fish exhibited similar mobility, which was more variable among males. A majority of redds were found in restored areas, and both helicopterand excavator-scattered gravels were accepted as spawning substrates. Our results indicate that natural reproduction of the studied landlocked salmon population can be successfully returned to its original spawning river by restoration of habitats and transfer of spawners.					; Kortet, Raine/J-5027-2012	Huuskonen, Hannu/0000-0001-5609-768X; Kortet, Raine/0000-0003-3749-1096													0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2021	78	2					184	192		10.1139/cjfas-2019-0334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2019-0334													WOS:000618063000009

The problem of the efficiency of stocking with hatchery-reared salmonids concerns many river catchments and populations around the world. Simultaneously, fish marking is a commonly used method to evaluate the effectiveness of undertaken restocking practices. In the present study, we compared some basic biological parameters of juveniles endemic lake-migratory brown trout (Salmo trutta lacustris L.), unmarked and marked as larvae with alizarin red S and released into the natural environment. As a result, no significant differences were observed in growth and abundance between the two groups of young-of-the-year trout in three consecutive seasons. However, there was notable differentiation in the overall condition and survival of juveniles between seasons, most likely as a result of streambed regulation. In addition, observed variations in specific growth rate could be affected by the size of fish before stocking. These results provide assumptions for restocking and recovery activities.					; Lejk, Adam/J-1500-2016	Lejk, Adam/0000-0002-1648-4308; Radtke, Grzegorz/0000-0002-5295-3968													0165-7836	1872-6763				FEB	2021	234								105786	10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105786													WOS:000600866800016
J	Burns, SJ				Burns, Stephen J.			Speleothem records of changes in tropical hydrology over the Holocene and possible implications for atmospheric methane	HOLOCENE												Recent speleothem records from the tropics of both hemispheres document a gradual decrease in the intensity of the monsoons in the Northern Hemisphere and increase in the Southern Hemisphere monsoons over the Holocene. These changes are a direct response of the monsoons to precession-driven insolation variability. With regard to atmospheric methane, this shift should result in a decrease in Northern Hemisphere tropical methane emissions and increase in Southern Hemisphere emissions. It is plausible that that overall tropical methane production experienced a minimum in the mid-Holocene because of decreased seasonality in rainfall at the margins of the tropics. Changes in tropical methane production alone might, therefore, explain many of the characteristics of Holocene methane concentrations and isotopic chemistry.

A total of 478 grab samples were tested from March 2000 to December 2008. Analysis was conducted on the changes of pH, temperature and concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) along time. Results showed that average concentrations of DO, COD and BOD5 in the rainy season were 28%, 7% and 6% lower than those in the dry season, respectively. Average concentrations of NH3-N, TN and TP in the rainy season were 48%, 27% and 47% more than those in the dry season, respectively. DO concentration decreased by more than 1 mg/L in the rainy season due to non-point source pollution. These results demonstrated that non-point source pollution was a quite important pollution source to Wetland Baiyangdian. Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in Wetland Baiyangdian mainly came from non-point sources. To reduce the TN and TP concentrations in the wetland, fertilizer utilization needs to be better controlled in the surrounding farmlands.

Three dam-induced hydraulic changes have been identified as relevant: (1) water level increase, (2) leveling of the seasonal outflow, and (3) subsurface release of water from the dam. The potential effect of these alterations on primary productivity were tested with a numerical model supported by field observations. Hydraulic modifications can reduce lake productivity by up to 40%, primarily as a result of altered flow path and allowing nutrients to pass through the reservoir without entering the productive zone near the surface. This productivity loss is comparable to the reduction caused by nutrient retention behind dams constructed upstream of the Arrow Lakes Reservoir. The combined productivity loss from both of these two mechanisms is significant and may well be responsible for the dramatic decline of kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) observed in the Arrow Lakes Reservoir in the 1990s.

J	Kolluru, S; Gedam, SS; Chander, S; Sahay, A				Kolluru, Srinivas; Gedam, Shirishkumar S.; Chander, Shard; Sahay, Arvind			Development of chlorophyll-a concentration estimation algorithm for turbid productive inland waters in India	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Estimation of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration from remote-sensing reflectance derived from satellite imagery is highly effective in monitoring the spatial and temporal optical variations in water bodies. In turbid, productive and inland waters, implementation of traditional Chl-a estimation algorithms using the blue and green wavelength bands results in higher error in estimated Chl-a. To minimize the absorption and scattering effects of other water constituents like colored dissolved organic matter and particulate matter, the wavelengths bands in red and Near Infrared (NIR) are generally used for estimating Chl-a concentration in productive waters. Owing to a widely observed optical variability in natural waters, a single universal algorithm is not applicable to all waterbodies, hence, regional tuning of algorithms is necessary for estimating Chl-a in turbid and inland productive waters. Here, a 2-band based algorithm of the form R-rs(lambda(1))/R-rs(lambda(2)) and a 3-band algorithm of form [R-rs(-1)(lambda 1)-R-rs(-1)(lambda(2))] x Rrs(lambda 3) were tuned for Chl-a estimation based on field measurements carried out in three water bodies, Chilika Lake of Orissa, Ujjani Reservoir of Maharashtra, Vallabh Sagar Reservoir of Gujarat, India, wherein the observed Chl-a concentration range is 5-33 mg/m(3). Together with measured in situ reflectance spectra and concurrent Chl-a concentrations, tuning of red-NIR algorithms is performed. The optimal wavelengths to estimate Chl-a found by the proximal sensing method are lambda(1) = 691 nm and lambda(2) = 667 nm in case of 2-band red-NIR type algorithm. For 3-band red-NIR algorithm, the optimal wavelengths are lambda(1) = 670 nm, lambda(2) = 696 nm and lambda(3) = 740 nm. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values obtained for the estimated Chl-a using the tuned 2-band red-NIR algorithm are 29.9% and 5.35 mg/m(3), respectively. Similarly, RMSE and MAPE values for Chl-a concentration estimated using the 3-band tuned red-NIR algorithm are 4.24 mg/m3 and 22.5%, respectively. The tuned 2-band and 3-band algorithms resulted in better Chl-a estimates than the fourteen blue-green and red-NIR algorithms from previous studies. The 2-band and 3-band algorithms were re-calibrated to wavelengths present in the ocean land color imager (OLCI) sensor on Sentinel-3 satellite to monitor these water bodies. Spatio-temporal analysis of OLCI imagery derived Chl-a concentrations over Chilika lake (2019 and 2020) indicated seasonal variations. The tuned 3-band red-NIR algorithm exhibited robust performance in all seasons despite wide variations in colored dissolved organic matter and suspended sediments. The tuned red-NIR algorithms are useful in monitoring inland turbid productive waters with upcoming missions such as Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud Ecosystem (PACE) and Oceansat-3.

The aim was to determine the influence of the local effects of climatic and hydrological variables on new malaria cases. Data was gathered on the river level, precipitation, air temperature, and the number of new cases of autochthonous malaria between January 2003 and December 2013. Monthly averages, time series decompositions, cross-correlations, and multiple regressions revealed different relationships at each location. The sampling region in the upper Rio Negro indicated no statistically significant results. However, monthly averages suggest that precipitation and air temperature correlate positively with the occurrence of new cases of malaria. In the mid Rio Negro and Puraquequara Lake, the river level positively correlated, and temperature negatively correlated with new transmissions, while precipitation correlated negatively in the mid Rio Negro and positively on the lake. Overall, the river level is a key variable affecting the formation of breeding sites, while precipitation may either develop or damage them. A negative temperature correlation is associated with the occurrence of new annual post-peak cases of malaria, when the monthly average exceeds 28.5 degrees C. This suggests that several factors contribute to the occurrence of new malaria cases as higher temperatures are reached at the same time as precipitation and the river levels are lowest. Differences between signals and correlation lags indicate that local characteristics have an impact on how different variables influence the disease vector's life cycle, pathogens, and consequently, new cases of malaria.

Occurrence of trypanosome infections in cattle in relation to season, livestock movement and management practices of Maasai pastoralists in Northern Tanzania	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS												African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is a parasitic disease considered to be one of the greatest constraints to cattle production in Tanzania. There is insufficient information on seasonal occurrence of AAT and management practices in Monduli District of the Maasai Steppe ecosystem to guide and prioritize AAT control programs. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in 10 randomly selected villages of Monduli District. Information on seasonal animal movements, including wildlife interaction, and AAT management practices was gathered using a standardized questionnaire with 130 pastoralists. Blood samples were collected from a total of 960 cattle, in wet and dry seasons. An entomological survey was also undertaken in the dry season. Polymerase chain reaction targeting the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) was used for parasite identification in cattle blood and in tsetse flies. The overall apparent prevalence of AAT in cattle was 5.8% (95% CI of 4.1-8.3) and 4.2% (95% CI of 2.7-6.3) during wet and dry reasons, respectively. Trypanosoma vivax was the most common species identified in cattle. All tsetse flies (n = 426) collected were trapped in Esilalei village which is in close proximity to Lake Manyara National Park. Tsetse fly infection status was determined to be 7.0%; (CI 95% of 4.9-9.8%) with nearly 50% of infections due to T. congolense. All 130 cattle owners reported that they could easily recognize AAT and the majority (75%) identified the most prominent clinical signs. Nearly all owners (98.5%) identified that tsetse flies were responsible for AAT transmission. All cattle owners (100%) reported the use of trypanocides for AAT treatment, while 2.3% reported to also use herbal medicine. The trypanocides, Novidium (R) and Berenil (R), were the most frequently reported commercial drugs and were used by 42% of cattle owners. Vector control by hand spraying was reported by the majority (90.8%) of cattle owners, while dipping and deployment of insecticideimpregnated targets were reported by few cattle owners (16.2% and 5.4%, respectively). The majority of cattle owners (83.1%) reported to move cattle away from home villages during the dry season with many migrating to areas in close proximity to wildlife parks. This study confirms the presence of circulating pathogenic trypanosomes in tsetse flies which continue to pose a threat to Maasai cattle. The seasonal movement of cattle during the dry season was associated with more clinical cases of cattle trypanosomosis. This study demonstrates the need to strengthen surveillance and control strategies for AAT.					; Toribio, Jenny-Ann/B-5032-2011	Mor, Siobhan/0000-0003-0121-2016; 													2405-9390					MAY	2018	12						91	98		10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.02.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.02.007								31014817					WOS:000592462400018
J	Loikith, PC; Waliser, DE; Kim, J; Ferraro, R				Loikith, Paul C.; Waliser, Duane E.; Kim, Jinwon; Ferraro, Robert			Evaluation of cool season precipitation event characteristics over the Northeast US in a suite of downscaled climate model hindcasts	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Cool season precipitation event characteristics are evaluated across a suite of downscaled climate models over the northeastern US. Downscaled hindcast simulations are produced by dynamically downscaling the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model (RCM) and the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) global climate model. NU-WRF RCM simulations are produced at 24, 12, and 4-km horizontal resolutions using a range of spectral nudging schemes while the MERRA2 global downscaled run is provided at 12.5-km. All model runs are evaluated using four metrics designed to capture key features of precipitation events: event frequency, event intensity, even total, and event duration. Overall, the downscaling approaches result in a reasonable representation of many of the key features of precipitation events over the region, however considerable biases exist in the magnitude of each metric. Based on this evaluation there is no clear indication that higher resolution simulations result in more realistic results in general, however many small-scale features such as orographic enhancement of precipitation are only captured at higher resolutions suggesting some added value over coarser resolution. While the differences between simulations produced using nudging and no nudging are small, there is some improvement in model fidelity when nudging is introduced, especially at a cutoff wavelength of 600 km compared to 2000 km. Based on the results of this evaluation, dynamical regional downscaling using NU-WRF results in a more realistic representation of precipitation event climatology than the global downscaling of MERRA2 using GEOS-5.

The vertical profiles of these elements in Lakes Hovsgol and Baikal were almost constant, except V showed slightly lower concentrations in the epilimnion, probably because of biological activity. Based on residence time calculations, it is inferred that V and U are removed from Lake Baikal via some biogeochemical processes, whereas Mo is almost nonreactive within the lake. Such differences might be attributable to their adsorptive behaviors onto solid phases, including sediments and suspended particles. The dissolved concentrations of these elements showed similar variation in the Egiin Gol and Selenga Rivers, and the highest concentration within these rivers was observed after the confluence of the Orkhon River, a tributary of the Selenga River. The concentrations in the Angara River were almost constant along its length. On the other hand, in the Yenisei River, the inflow of a tributary (the Nyzhnyaya Tunguska River) strongly affected the distributions of the trace elements. The concentrations of V and Mo at several sampling stations, particularly on the Selenga and Orkhon rivers, exceeded the maximum permitted concentration of Russian fishing industry regulations (MPCfish). The high concentrations in the Orkhon River might be attributable to pollution, whereas those in the Selenga River are probably natural because its watershed has been affected little by mining and other anthropogenic activities.

We hypothesize that the trophic structure of consumers can be significantly affected by primary food sources (pelagic, benthic, and littoral sources) through complex trophic interactions. This study used stable isotope analysis and Bayesian mixing models to estimate the trophic levels of fish consumers and the contributions of primary food sources in the three sub-lakes (Eastern, Southern, and Western Dongting) of Lake Dongting, which have different physical and chemical parameters of water, fish species diversity, and plankton (phytoplankton and zooplankton) density. Results showed the differences in community structures of fish among sub-lakes. Fish trophic levels were significantly higher in Eastern Dongting than those in the two other areas. The contributions of primary food sources to fishes were as follows: the pelagic source was the main basal food source in Eastern Dongting, and littoral and pelagic sources played equally essential roles in Southern Dongting; fishes in Western Dongting relied on more benthic source to growth than those in the two other regions. This study can fill gaps in our knowledge of the influence of the underlying food available on trophic structure of consumers by exploring the role of primary food sources and making the trophic structure of consumers in the aquatic food web highly complicated and diverse through control of the distribution of primary food sources.					; Xie, Ping/AAL-7532-2020	Yu, Jia/0000-0002-8640-7834; 														2073-4441				MAY	2018	10	5							602	10.3390/w10050602	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10050602													WOS:000435196700068

Impact of Irrigation Strategies on Abscisic Acid and its Catabolites Profiles in Leaves and Berries of Baco noir Grapes	JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION												To understand the relationship among soil and plant water status, plant physiology, and the hormonal profiles associated with it, abscisic acid (ABA) and its catabolites [phaseic acid (PA), dihydrophaseic acid (DPA), 7-hydroxy-ABA, 8'-hydroxy-ABA, neophaseic acid, and abscisic acid glucose ester (ABA-GE)] in leaves and berries from wine grape cultivar Baco noir (Folle blanche x Vitis riparia) were analyzed. The experiment was conducted during the growing seasons 2006 and 2007 in an irrigation trial set up in a commercial vineyard located in Niagara-on-the-Lake, ON, Canada. ABA and its metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography with ion trap combined with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The hormonal profile indicated a direct relationship between the amount of ABA and climatic factors. The ABA varied between 582 and 4,026 ng g(-1) dry matter (DM), DPA between 417 and 562 ng g(-1), and ABA-GE between 337 and 2,764 ng g(-1) DM. At many sampling times PA in the leaves was undetectable, and its highest concentration (260 ng g(-1) DM) was at beginning of July 2007. ABA followed different catabolic pathways depending on the plant water status. ABA was likely catabolized by conjugation to form ABA-GE in treatments at higher water deficit levels, whereas in treatments with high water status, the oxidation pathway leading to DPA or PA was likely preferred. The ABA and ABA-GE concentrations in the berries at harvest showed high correlation with soil and plant water status.

Thus, this work aimed to determine the changes in soil moisture after damming, to understand the consequences of this modification on the arboreal community of dry forests, some of the most endangered systems on the planet. We studied these changes in soil moisture and the arboreal community in three dry forests in the Araguari River Basin, after two dams construction in 2005 and 2006, and the potential effects on these forests. For this, plots of 20m x 10m were distributed close to the impoundment margin and perpendicular to the dam margin in two deciduous dry forests and one semi-deciduous dry forest located in Southeastern Brazil, totaling 3.6ha sampled. Besides, soil analysis were undertaken before and after impoundment at three different depths (0-10, 20-30 and 40-50cm). A tree (minimum DBH of 4.77cm) community inventory was made before (TO) and at two (T2) and four (T4) years after damming. Annual dynamic rates of all communities were calculated, and statistical tests were used to determine changes in soil moisture and tree communities. The analyses confirmed soil moisture increases in all forests, especially during the dry season and at sites closer to the reservoir; besides, an increase in basal area due to the fast growth of many trees was observed. The highest turnover occurred in the first two years after impoundment, mainly due to the higher tree mortality especially of those closer to the dam margin. All forests showed reductions in dynamic rates for subsequent years (T2-T4), indicating that these forests tended to stabilize after a strong initial impact. The modifications were more extensive in the deciduous forests, probably because the dry period resulted more rigorous in these forests when compared to semideciduous forest. The new shorelines created by damming increased soil moisture in the dry season, making plant growth easier. We concluded that several changes occurred in the T0-T2 period and at 0-30m to the impoundment, mainly for the deciduous forests, where this community turned into a "riparian-deciduous forest" with large basal area in these patches. However, unlike other transitory disturbances, damming is a permanent alteration and transforms the landscape to a different scenario, probably with major long-term consequences for the environment.

In addition, four unconnected constructed ponds aged >= 20 years with established zooplankton communities were sampled and compared to the LWL pond. The species richness of both LWL pond and Ramsey lake increased over the ice-free season, although Ramsey lake always had more species. Almost half of all species sampled occurred in both pond and lake. None of the zooplankton communities in the ponds used in the spatial analysis resembled communities of the LWL pond or one another. Taken together, these results indicate a lack of dispersal limitation, which suggests that differing local habitat factors had a strong influence in structuring the zooplankton communities.

Spatio-temporal variation in river otter (Lontra canadensis) diet and latrine site activity	ECOSCIENCE												Fluctuations in the distribution and abundance of prey resources are an important influence on the foraging ecology of carnivores. Spatio-temporal variation in the diet of river otters (Lontra canadensis), however, is not well understood. In addition, we have limited knowledge about seasonal changes in otter activity at latrine sites and how these changes may relate to changes in otter diet. We used a combination of scat content and stable-isotope analyses to assess the contributions of different prey items to otter diet. We investigated the spatio-temporal variation in the availability of prey groups as it influenced the composition of otter diet and the number of scat deposited at latrine sites. A combination of fish spawning period, water-body type, and lake best described the presence of salmonidae, minnows, and insects in otter scats. The number of scats was best described by a two-week calendar time measurement and geographic location. Scat deposition was positively influenced by a time period when no fish were spawning (early July) and the kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) spawning period (early September). In general, the stable-isotope analysis agreed with the results of the scat content analysis: fish dominated the diet, with lesser contributions from other prey items. The stable-isotope analysis, however, suggested that sockeye salmon, larger species of fish (burbot, lake trout), and birds contributed more than was revealed by scat content analysis. Management strategies require accurate and unbiased information on wildlife distribution and abundance that is often measured from surveys of sign; this study provides some of the critical information needed to interpret surveys for river otters. We also suggest implications for other wildlife species.																			1195-6860	2376-7626					2013	20	1					28	39		10.2980/20-1-3509	http://dx.doi.org/10.2980/20-1-3509													WOS:000327855400004

Nearshore-offshore differences in planktonic chlorophyll and phytoplankton nutrient status after dreissenid establishment in a large shallow lake	INLAND WATERS												In Lake Simcoe, a large lake in southern Ontario, Canada, with more than 50% of its surface area <15 m deep, dreissenid mussels are abundant in the extensive nearshore zone but not offshore. We hypothesized that mussel grazing would depress chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations in the nearshore compared to the offshore while alleviating nearshore phosphorus (P) deficiency through nutrient regeneration. During both years of our study Chl-a concentration and other indicators of phytoplankton biomass, including particulate carbon (C), nitrogen, P, and silicon, were lower in the nearshore areas of Lake Simcoe where the exotic invader Dreissenia polymorpha was in contact with overlying epilimnetic water. In the first year of our study, grazing and associated nutrient regeneration activity seemed to reduce P deficiency in phytoplankton in the dreissenid-impacted shallow locations. In the second year, however, phytoplankton in the nearshore dreissenid-affected areas remained as strongly P deficient as phytoplankton in offshore waters physically separated from dreissenid grazing. Photoacclimation in the nearshore phytoplankton was evident in higher particulate C: Chl-a ratios and higher effective absorptive cross section of photosystem II (sPS II) throughout the stratified sampling season compared to offshore phytoplankton. A multiple linear regression utilizing the mean light intensity in the mixed layer as well as total P (TP) resulted in better predictions of Chl-a than TP alone. We conclude that, in shallow lakes where transparency is strongly impacted by dreissenid grazing, the comparison of Chl-a-TP relationships over time will require accounting for the effect of changing transparency.

Bacteria freely floating in water or associated with suspended particles are the key microorganisms degrading pesticides; their species and populations, however, depend on sites and seasons. The various factors related to pesticide properties, experimental conditions and characteristics of surface water are involved in the complex control of microbial processes. Bottom sediment and macrophytes with associated biofilms not only act as sink for pesticides but also provide the habitat for both bacteria and fungi that degrade pesticides.

The aim of presented study was to characterize the significance of charophytes as indicators of habitat differentiation of lakes using the number of species, number of communities and the percentage share in the phytolittoral area. Each lake was characterized based on the results of macrophyte vegetation, vegetation depth extent, pelagic phytoplankton biomass, lakes area, max. depth, SD visibility, pH, conductivity, O-2, total hardness, Ca, Mg, PO4, TP, NH4, NO3, NO2, org.,TN. The statistical analyses (PCA), revealed that the investigated lakes were differentiated according to the basic morphometrical and physicochemical parameters and that the differentiation was reflected in the percentage share of charophytes in phytolittoral (in general - the bigger, deeper and more clear water were the lakes, the greater part of phytolittoral was covered by charophytes). Using simple cluster analysis based on the number of different types of macrophyte communities (helophytes, elodeids, nymphaeids and charophytes) two distinct groups of lakes were distinguished. Charophyte communities were at most responsible for obtained differentiation (one group with 0 or 1 and second with 1-6 charophyte communities). The distinguished groups of lakes differed significantly as regards 12, out of all 18 considered parameters. The greatest differences were evidenced for area, max. depth, SD visibility, Ca, Mg, NH4, NO3, phytoplankton biomass and vegetation depth extent. Similar analyses were made for the number of charophyte species, for which the lakes were divided into four groups (0-1,2-3,4-5 and 6-7 charophyte species per lake). In this case 11 parameters significantly differed between distinguished groups of lakes, showing, that better habitat conditions were in the lakes where more charophyte species were stated. The obtained results revealed that all analyzed charophyte indicators (the number of species, number of communities as well as the percentage share in the phytolittoral area) very clearly reflect habitat variation and water quality of lakes and thus may be used as valuable bioindicators of lakes condition.					; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Pukacz, Andrzej/L-7757-2014; Pukacz, Andrzej/O-1936-2019	Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; Pelechata, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7487-8348; Pukacz, Andrzej/0000-0002-2395-1680; 													1505-2249						2013	61	1					105	118																WOS:000317168000010

Nest site selection and breeding parameters were studied at two contrasting sites in north-east Algeria: Boussedra, an unprotected freshwater marsh of 55 ha subject to anthropogenic influence, during 2005 and 2008, and Lake Tonga, a protected freshwater marsh of 2 400 ha in 2009. Most nests (92%) at Boussedra were located in dense stands of lesser bulrush Typha angustifolia, whereas a few were found on lower branches of tamarisk Tamarix gallica trees. In contrast, at Lake Tonga nests were predominantly found on Scirpus lacustris (41%) or associated with alder trees Alnus glutinosa (32%). Egg-laying at both sites occurred between early April and the end of June. There was a significant decrease in egg volume as the breeding season progressed. Mean clutch size at Lake Tonga (7.8 +/- 2.9, N = 23 clutches) did not differ significantly from that at Boussedra (6.7 +/- 2.1, N = 14 clutches). Similarly, hatching success (67-72%) and predation rate of nests with eggs (16-28%) did not vary significantly between sites. The Common Moorhen may be more resilient than marsh specialists to anthropogenic changes.					; Samraoui, Boudjéma/E-6761-2011; Samraoui, Farrah/E-6757-2011	Samraoui, Boudjema/0000-0002-0608-9021; Samraoui, Farrah/0000-0003-2407-3004; 													0030-6525	1727-947X					2013	84	2					137	144		10.2989/00306525.2013.823130	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306525.2013.823130													WOS:000326502100008

Earthquake-induced load casts, pseudonodules, ball-and-pillow structures, and convolute lamination: Additional deformation structures for paleoseismic studies	RECENT ADVANCES IN NORTH AMERICAN PALEOSEISMOLOGY AND NEOTECTONICS EAST OF THE ROCKIES	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The study of paleoliquefaction grew out of (1) the recognition that earthquakes left their imprint on soft sediments as deformational structures primarily through liquefaction, and (2) the need for applying paleoseismology to settings in which active faults were not readily recognizable, accessible, or did not reach the surface. Earthquake-induced liquefaction features are distinctive, and their formation is a result of strong ground shaking that may or may not result in lateral spreading. Paleoliquefaction features include sand blows, and intrusive dikes and sills, as well as less prominent, but equally informative features such as load casts, pseudonodules, ball-and-pillow structures, and convolute lamination. Fluvial depositional environments, with generally easy access and relatively abundant natural outcrops, have been the primary choice for conducting paleoseismic studies. In general, when relying on sand dikes and sills, sand blows, and their related structures common in fluvial sediments, one is restricted to river valleys. Depending on the density of the drainage network and the size of the streams, one may not obtain as much data as would be desired. Therefore, other environments that may contain earthquake-induced liquefaction structures may need to be sought out. Lacustrine and paleolacustrine deposits also have a distinctive suite of liquefaction-induced sedimentary structures, most commonly pseudonodules and load casts, and less commonly convolute lamination. However, these structures are not limited to lacustrine deposits, because they have been observed in paleoliquefaction source beds in the New Madrid seismic zone, liquefaction accompanying the 26 January 2001, Bhuj, India, earthquake, and liquefaction associated with the Charlevoix seismic zone. The earliest earthquake-induced paleoliquefaction features were described and correlated to specific earthquakes using soft-sediment deformational structures in lake sediments and a series of modern earthquakes in California, and deformational structures in prehistoric lake sediments. Ancient lake deposits have been used for paleoseismological studies with some success in the United States in California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Such deposits have also been successfully used in Europe and the Middle East. The most promising of these studies have been in varved glaciolacustrine deposits. Varves are small-scale (centimeter to millimeter) sedimentary units. They form in a variety of marine and lacustrine depositional environments from seasonal variation in clastic, biological, and chemical sedimentary processes. The most common seismically induced structures that occur in varved glaciolacustrine deposits are pseudonodules.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2493-5				2013	493						191	201		10.1130/2012.2493(09)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2012.2493(09)	10.1130/9780813724935												WOS:000329865200010

For interpretation of the data, a spectral library of different macrophyte and sediment reflectances is under development. Therefore, multi-temporal in situ remote sensing reflectances were sampled from May to October 2011 with hyperspectral RAMSES spectroradiometers. Occurring spectral variations during the growing season could be linked to biometric and phenological data of the particulate species. Principal component analyses showed that, by applying the presented method, differentiation of the macrophytes from sediment and among each other is possible and can be improved by multi-temporal data.

Microcystins (MCYSTs) were detected by HPLC in 7 of these lakes, and the total MCYST concentration per scum dry weight ranged from 50.3 to 1638 +/- 464 mug g(-1). Cyanobacterial genera (Microcystis, Anabaena, Anabaenopsis, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis) with known toxin producing taxa were present in 31 freshwaters. From our data and a review of the literature, it would appear that Mediterranean countries are more likely 1) to have toxic cyanobacterial blooms consisting of Microcystis spp. and 2) to have higher intracellular MCYST concentrations. A case study in Lake Kastoria is used to highlight seasonal patterns of cyanobacterial and MCYST-LR occurrence and to assess cyanotoxin risk. Cyanobacterial biovolume was high (> 11 muL L-1) throughout the year and was in excess of Guidance Level 2 (10 muL L-1) proposed by WHO for recreational waters and Alert Level 2 for drinking water. Further, surface water samples from April to November exceeded Guidance Level 3, with the potential for acute cyanobacterial poisoning. Intracellular MCYST-LR concentrations (max 3186 mug L-1) exceeded the WHO guideline for drinking water (1 mug L-1) from September to November with a high risk of adverse health effects. Preliminary evidence indicates that in 3 lakes microcystins are accumulated in some aquatic organisms. Generally, a high risk level can be deduced from the data for the Mediterranean region.					; VARDAKA, Elisabeth/ABD-1341-2020; Thomas, Lanaras/AAC-3946-2020	Vardaka, Elisabeth/0000-0002-3698-9135; 													0323-4320					JUN	2004	32	2					107	124		10.1002/aheh.200300523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aheh.200300523													WOS:000222717400001

Previous studies have mainly focused on disasters due to abrupt drops in surface temperatures, with less discussion of the strong winds associated with CWEs. Based on an intense CWE that occurred in late December 2020, we investigated the evolutionary mechanisms of the associated strong winds in terms of kinetic energy (KE) budget and evaluated the effects of this CWE on wind power production based on quantitative comparisons with the mean state. The results showed that the CWE occurred under favorable background conditions, which were characterized by a southward-moving transversal trough and a southeastward-moving shortwave trough in the middle troposphere. The surface high ridge that formed around Lake Baikal and the cold front around the southern periphery of the ridge were key factors related to the CWE evolution. The positive work carried out on the horizontal wind by the pressure gradient force that linked a lower tropospheric high-pressure ridge inland and a low-pressure trough offshore and the downward momentum transportation due to the descending motions behind the cold front dominated the enhancement and sustainment of the CWE-associated strong winds. The CWE contributed to wind power production by 1) increasing the wind power density (by an average of similar to 1.05-fold) and 2) improving the availability of the wind to generate power, as it reduced the percentage of zero wind power generation by similar to 6.4%, while maintaining the high-wind-velocity cut-out percentage.					wang, fei/M-1445-2013; MA, HUI/ADI-3575-2022; Ma, Hui/ADI-3575-2022	MA, HUI/0000-0003-3967-7636; 														2296-6463				JAN 18	2023	10								1054037	10.3389/feart.2022.1054037	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.1054037													WOS:000921870000001

The effects of N:P ratio and nitrogen form on four major freshwater bacterial taxa in biofilms	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Bacteria in freshwater systems play an important role in nutrient cycling through both assimilatory and dissimilatory processes. Biotic and abiotic components of the environment affect these transformations as does the stoichiometry of the nutrients. We examined responses of four major taxa of bacteria in biofilms subjected to various N:P molar ratios using either nitrate or ammonium as a nitrogen source. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to enumerate the Domain bacteria as well as the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacteria, and the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria cluster. Generally, bacterial responses to the treatments were limited. However, the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria and beta-proteobacteria both responded more to the ammonium additions than nitrate, whereas, the alpha-proteobacteria responded more to nitrate additions. The beta-proteobacteria also exhibited peak relative abundance at the highest N: P ratio. Nutrient concentrations were significantly different after the incubation period, and there were distinct changes in the stoichiometry of the microcosms with ammonium. We demonstrated that bacteria may play an important role in nutrient uptake, and transformation, and can have a dramatic effect on the nutrient stoichiometry of the surrounding water. However, although some taxa exhibited differences in response to ammonium and nitrate, the impact of nutrient stoichiometry on the abundance of the taxa examined was limited.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				JAN	2010	56	1					32	43		10.1139/W09-099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/W09-099								20130692					WOS:000274352000006

Fish dispersal in a seasonal wetland: influence of anthropogenic structures	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Knowledge of fish dispersal routes when exploiting temporary habitat is important for understanding the ecology of species and for designing and conducting conservation and land-management activities. We evaluated fish dispersal in a network of seasonal habitats and a permanent fish source (a lake) in a subtropical wetland, in Florida, sampled biweekly from May 2002 to May 2003. Fish dispersal routes were influenced by (1) local physical conditions, (2) anthropogenic alterations and (3) fish species and size. Fish from the source dispersed into 9 of the 25 seasonal sites evaluated, via temporarily formed dispersal corridors between the source and the sites. Low connection depths along the corridors were a key factor, allowing small-bodied species (e.g. Gambusia holbrooki, Elassoma evergladei) to travel farther than large-bodied fish (e.g. Erimyzon sucetta, Lepomis macrochirus). Fish travelled distances of 0.7-4 km. Anthropogenic structures both enhanced (ditches, sand roads) and blocked (a railroad, soil dumps) fish dispersal routes. We demonstrated extensive opportunistic use by fish of seasonal wetlands. Our results indicated that anthropogenic alterations to the landscape can provide habitat for native fish and also allow dispersal of non-native fish and thus should be implemented with care.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2010	61	6					682	694		10.1071/MF09140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF09140													WOS:000279106700006

Cladocerans are a very representative zooplankton group with high species diversity. Most of this diversity can be found at littoral zones of lakes and reservoirs, especially those occupied by macrophytes. This study was part of a thematic project FAPESP/BIOTA Program - The Virtual Institute of Biodiversity (www.biotasp.org.br), and its aim is to catalogue and analyze the distribution of cladoceran species (Crustacea, Anomopoda and Ctenopoda) in pelagic and littoral zones from small reservoirs in the northwest of the Sao Paulo State, in dry and rainy seasons. Zooplankton samplings were carried out in littoral and pelagic zone of 10 small shallow reservoirs (mean depth: 2.8 m) using a plankton 45 mu m mesh net. Water physical and chemical parameters were also monitored with a multiparameter Horiba U10. pH and dissolved oxygen concentration were lower at rainy than dry seasons, indicating high decomposition rates of organic matter introduced from the rural environment, being the main factor contributing to reservoirs' eutrophication. Fifty eight cladocerans species were recorded, with four new occurrences for the Sao Paulo State. This high richness contrasts with the high devastation of the northwestern region in the State. During the two seasons, littoral zones presented higher cladoceran richness and diversity than pelagic zone. Littoral zones with higher macrophytes diversity also showed higher cladocerans richness and diversity than that with low macrophyte diversity. Littoral and pelagic zones comparisons emphasized the importance of studies on different regions of the aquatic environments, confirming the elevated richness in the littoral zone, as reported in previous works. This study revealed also the strong influence of the macrophyte community and the adjacent terrestrial environment, which is occupied by forest or agriculture.					; Noll, Maria/C-9774-2012	Castilho Noll, Maria Stela Maioli/0000-0002-1839-0751; 													1676-0603					JAN-MAR	2010	10	1					21	30		10.1590/S1676-06032010000100001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1676-06032010000100001													WOS:000208418800002

A., Jr.			Water-quality effects of a mechanized subsurface-banding technique for applying poultry litter to perennial grassland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Poultry litter is known to be an excellent organic fertilizer, but the common practice of spreading litter on the surface of pastures has raised serious water-quality concerns and may limit potential benefits of litter applications. Because surface-applied litter is completely exposed to the atmosphere, runoff can transport nutrients into nearby streams and lakes, and much of the ammonium nitrogen volatilizes before it can enter the soil. Our previous research showed that a manual knifing technique to apply dry litter under a perennial pasture surface effectively prevented about 90% of nutrient loss with runoff from surface-applied litter, and tended to increase forage yield. However, this technique (known as subsurface banding) cannot become a practical management option for producers until it is mechanized. To begin that process, we tested an experimental single-shank, tractor-drawn implement designed to apply poultry litter in subsurface bands. Our objective was to compare this mechanized subsurface-banding method against conventional surface application to determine effects on nutrient loss with runoff from a perennial grassland treated with dry poultry litter. Early in the growing season, broiler litter was applied (6.7 dry-weight Mg ha(-1)) to each plot (except three control plots) using one of two application methods: surface broadcast manually or subsurface banded using the tractor-drawn implement. Simulated rainfall (5 cm h(-1)) generated 20 min of runoff from each plot for volume and analytical measurements. Results showed that subsurface-banded litter increased forage yield while decreasing nutrient (e.g. N and P) loss in runoff by at least 90% compared to surface-broadcast litter.

This study examined the occurrence and distribution of Microcystins (MCYST) in the shallow eutrophic lake Pamvotis (Greece). MCYST concentrations in the tissues (liver, kidneys, intestine, gonads, brain and muscle) of the fish species Carassius gibelio were also examined. Tests were performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). MCYST concentration in water and in the scum of Lake Pamvotis were highest during the warm period (April-October, 2005). Phytoplankton samples were dominated by the genera Microcystis and Anabaena during the same period. MCYST values were always below the WHO Guide level for recreational waters but much higher than the WHO Guide level for drinking water. It was found that MCYST can accumulate in the fish tissues of C. gibelio. Even though the target organ for MCYST is the liver, in our study MCYST were found also in the rest of C. gibelio tissues in the following order: intestine > kidney > > brain > gonads > muscle. Muscle tissue contained concentrations of microcystins that correspond to 0.096 mu g/kg/day well above the recommended limit for human consumption (0.04 mu g/Kg/day).

Previous studies demonstrated that simulations with convection-permitting resolutions improve lightning predictions compared to coarser-grid simulations using convection parameterizations for different geographical locations but not over the boreal zone. In this study, lightning simulations with the NASA Unified-Weather Research and Forecasting model are evaluated over a domain including the Great Slave Lake in Canada, for six lightning seasons. The simulations are performed at convection-parameterized (9 km) and convection-permitting (3 km) resolution using the Goddard 4ICE and the Thompson microphysics schemes. Four lightning indices are evaluated against observations from the Canadian Lightning Detection Network, in terms of spatiotemporal frequency distribution, spatial pattern, daily climatology, and an event-based overall skill assessment. The Thompson scheme is, regardless of the spatial resolution, superior to the Goddard 4ICE scheme in predicting daily climatology but worse in predicting the spatial patterns of lightning occurrence. Results indicate that lightning estimation benefits from modeling at convection-permitting resolution, in particular for the ice-based lightning indices. In contrast, the product of convective available potential energy and precipitation rate proved to be the most robust index that was largely invariant to varying spatial resolution. Finally, this study reveals issues of the models to reproduce the observed spatial pattern of lightning well, which might be related to an insufficient representation of land surface heterogeneity, including peatlands, in the study area.

A high-resolution periodicity analysis of luminance and lamina thickness of lacustrine stromatolites in the Ebro Basin (northeast of Iberian Peninsula) reveals a significant signal of interannual and decadal climatic variability in the Miocene. This is one out of very few works that presents the use of spectral analysis to estimate the potential of stromatolite lamination as multiple-scale recorders of climate parameters. The effects of precipitation and evaporation variations on stromatolite lamination have been detected at three orders of cyclicity based on textural and high-resolution stable-isotope analyses (C and 0) obtained in prior studies. These analyses also revealed that the light and dark simple lamina couplets are identified with annual cycles (third-order isotopic cycles). In the present study, the spectral analysis results obtained through different paths in five stromatolite specimens reveal significant periods in the power spectrum at around 2.5, 3.7, 5, 7, 10, and 22 years. These cycles can be correlated with the typical oscillation bands of different climate-related agents. The 2.5-year period corresponds to the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO), or to the biennial component of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), or to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The 3 to 5 and 5 to 7-year bands can be linked to ENSO or NAO variability (second-order isotopic cycles). The 8 to 11-year bands fit the 11-year Schwabe (first-order isotopic cycles) and 22 to 23-year fit the 22-year Hale sunspot cycles. Thus, the stromatolite growth was controlled by ENSO, NAO, and solar activity cycles. The close relationship between these climate-related agents makes it difficult to specify the dominant agent controlling the stromatolite growth. Nevertheless, the significant periods obtained from this study, within interannual (2.5, 3.7, 5, 7 years), decadal (10, 22 years), and even multidecadal bands (37-42 years), support the existence, and concurrence, of ENSO and NAO precursors during the early and middle Miocene.

We discuss the application of a battery of both in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity tests on lake water as a tool for a more complete assessment of surface water quality. The lake water concentrated by adsorption on C-18 silica cartridges were used for the following in vitro biological assays: gene conversion, point mutation, mitochondrial DNA mutability assays on the diploid Saccharomices cerevisiae D7 strain, with or without endogenous P450 complex induction; DNA damage on fresh human leukocytes by the cot-net. Toxicity testing on yeast and human cells was also performed. In vivo genotoxicity was determined by the comet assay on two well-established bio-indicator organisms of water quality (Cyprinus carpio erythrocytes and Dreissena polymorpha haemocytes) exposed in situ. The in vivo experiments and the water samplings were carried out during different campaigns to detect seasonal variations of both the water contents and physiological state of the animals. Temperature and oxygen level seasonal variations and different pollutant contents in the lake water appeared to affect the DNA migration in carp and zebra mussel cells. Seasonal variability of lake water quality was also evident in the in vitro genotoxicity and cytotoxicity tests, with regards to water pollutant quantity and quality (direct-acting compounds or indirect-acting compounds on yeast cells). However, the measured biological effects did not appear clearly related to the physical-chemical characteristics of lake waters. Therefore, together with the conventional chemical analysis, mutagenicity/genotoxicity assays should be included as additional parameters in water quality monitoring programs: their use could permit the quantification of mutagenic hazard in surface waters.

Arctic charr were found in all main lake habitats, whereas the brown trout were almost exclusively found in the littoral zone. In both lakes the parasite fauna reflected the niche segregation between trout and charr. Surface insects were most common in the diet of trout, but transmit few parasites, and accordingly the brown trout had a relatively low diversity and abundance of parasites. Parasites transmitted by benthic prey such as Gammarus and insect larva, were common in both salmonid host species. Copepod transmitted parasites were much more common in Arctic charr, as brown trout did not include zooplankton in their diets. Parasite species that may use small fish as transport hosts, were far more abundant in piscivorous fish, especially brown trout. The seasonal dynamics in parasite infection were also consistent with the developments in the diet throughout the year. The study demonstrates that the structure of parasite communities of charr and the trout is highly dependent on shifts in habitat and diet of their hosts both on an annual base and through the ontogeny, in addition to the observed niche segregation between the two salmonid species.

Modeling the growth dynamics of Pistia stratiotes L. populations along the water courses of south Nile Delta, Egypt	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												We developed a dynamic numerical model to describe the growth production and the interaction between shoots and roots of Pistia stratiotes under natural conditions in south Nile Delta, Egypt. Two state variables, shoots and roots, were considered to simulate the growth of P. stratiotes. The biomass of each organ was formulated to incorporate the net growth of the plant as a function of photosynthesis, respiration, mortality, and translocation from shoots to roots. Shoots and roots biomasses of P. stratiotes was sampled monthly from May 2013 to February 2014 along three water courses of Giza Province using three randomly distributed quadrats (each of 0.5 x 0.5 m) at each water course. General trends for shoots biomass, such as the slow initial growth rate followed by a high growth rate, the timing of peak biomass, and the decline of biomass due to senescence, were successfully reproduced by the model. Many characteristics typical for the roots biomass, such as the increase in the roots biomass during the early growing season because of the translocation of materials from shoots, and the reduction of roots biomass during the later period of the season, were also reproduced. In general, there was a good agreement between the calculated results and field data although simulated results were slightly different from observations for roots biomass. In conclusion, Pistia model could be used to predict the potential growth of P. stratiotes and this model might be useful for practical applications such as the management of water courses.					; Eid, Ebrahem/O-2723-2013; Dakhil, Mohammed/U-9249-2019; Galal, Tarek/AAF-7604-2019	Galal, Tarek/0000-0001-9847-1051; Eid, Ebrahem/0000-0003-2452-4469; Dakhil, Mohammed/0000-0002-5140-1360													2037-4631	1720-0776				JUN	2016	27	2					375	382		10.1007/s12210-015-0492-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-015-0492-4													WOS:000376410300022

Timing of spawning and predicted fry emergence by naturalized Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in a Lake Huron tributary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We evaluated how well a naturalized Chinook salmon population matches their seasonal timing of spawning to the period of thermal suitability (i.e., phenological match) in the Sydenham River (Ontario), because this could be a factor in their persistence. In 2010 and 2011, the mean spawning date (= date of nest settlement) in the Sydenham River was in early October, about 7-12 days earlier than that of the source population at around the time of the transplant (Green River/Soos Creek, Washington, USA). Twenty-eight percent (2010) and 72% (2011) of females settled on nests when temperatures were above those considered suitable for spawning (>12.8 degrees C). From nest settlement to death, average water temperature was 9.5 degrees C in 2010 (n = 28) and 14.4 degrees C in 2011 (n = 22). Median egg retention rate showed a significant seasonal decline in the warmer year (2011), but overall rates (2010: 0.078, n = 20; 2011: 0.264, n = 13) were not significantly higher than rates for native populations of Oncorhynchus spp. (0.10). By applying Belehradek's model of temperature-dependent development to the Sydenham River population, we predicted fry to emerge from early April to early June at water temperatures of 7.3-17.3 degrees C, depending on the year and time of spawning. All but the latest emerging fry should experience thermally suitable conditions for growth (<15.6 degrees C). We suggest that thermally appropriate timing of juvenile growth may compensate for weak phenological match during the spawning season and may have contributed to the naturalization of Chinook salmon in the Sydenham River.

We conducted a field survey of DOM ultraviolet (UV) absorption and fluorescence in a large lake (Lake Biwa, Japan). We used an integrated analysis of their spectra, including their derivatives and apparent quantum yield. From this analysis we were able to identify the different DOM sources. Variations of dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the epilimnion were correlated with the first derivative of UV absorption at 285 nm and a protein-like peak in the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM). Both fingerprints were derived from living organisms. Although the variations of UV absorption over 300 nm and a humic-like peak in EEM in the lake water were affected by multiple sources and reactions, several complementary methods, including field studies and laboratory experiments, led to the conclusion that chromophoric DOM in the hypolimnion was intensively affected by microbial alteration. Our results indicate that an integrated analysis of UV absorption and fluorescence can improve the utility of DOM characterization in lake environments.

Non steady-state dynamics of stable oxygen isotopes for estimates of metabolic balance in large lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The ratio of gross photosynthesis to community respiration (P:R) is a vital characteristic of ecosystem function but is poorly defined in large lakes because traditional methods are impractical for measuring P and R on appropriate time and space scales. The new steady state in situ O-18 method has a great power to assess metabolic patterns in large lakes. However it could be confounded by seasonal and/or episodic temperature changes, which can violate the steady-state assumptions by altering the saturation level of dissolved O-2 without actual gain or loss of O-2 when air-water gas exchange is too slow to compensate for the altered solubility. We estimated P, R and P:R at three coastal sites of varied depth, productivity and physical exposure in the Laurentian Great Lakes by both the O-18 method and experimental incubations. At two shallow sites with low and moderate exposure to open lake forces, the O-18 and incubation methods returned similar estimates for P, R and P:R. The deepest site experienced large and frequent upwelling episodes and the O-18 method was unreliable, with P and R estimates usually negative. We define an O-2 saturation ratio (gamma) that determines the applicability of the O-18 method to any given system. Estimates obtained using observed O-2 saturation above this threshold are invalid. The gamma ratio increases with lake productivity. Higher productivity and/or shallower lakes appear good candidates for use of the O-18 method, but applications in deeper, physically-driven lakes will likely need explicit attention to temperature-driven non-steady state effects.

Spatiotemporal Classification Analysis of Long-Term Environmental Monitoring Data in the Northern Part of Lake Taihu, China by Using a Self-Organizing Map	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of water bodies is an important environmental issue in the management and protection of water resources. The primary objective of this study was to assess the spatiotemporal characteristics of environmental monitoring data from Lake Taihu to improve water pollution control practices. A methodologically systematic application of a self-organizing map (SOM) was utilized for data mining in the northern part of Lake Taihu, China. The monitoring data set contained 14 variables from eight monitoring stations during the period 2000-2006. The SOM classified the data set into 10 clusters displaying a markedly different pattern. We determined the spatiotemporal distribution of water quality based on the data frequency at each station monitored monthly in the study area. Based on the SOM analysis results, we suggest that the government should increase the number of monitoring points in the region. Given the relatively poor water quality in the region, unnecessary points should be decreased and different control measures should be implemented during different seasons. The results of this study could assist lake managers in developing suitable strategies and determining priorities for water pollution control and effective water resource management.
