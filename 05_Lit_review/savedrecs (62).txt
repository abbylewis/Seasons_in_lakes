K.; Kumar, Sanjeev			Increase in productivity enhances CH4 but limits N2O production in a shallow tropical lake experiencing seasonal volume reduction and salinization	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Lakes are hotspots for carbon and nitrogen cycling and a major contributor to the natural fluxes of greenhouse gases [GHGs: methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O)] to the atmosphere. Lake volume reduction and salinization are major threats to lakes across the globe, and their effect on lake biogeochemistry warrants detailed investigation. Given the majority of the studies addressing this crisis are from the higher latitudes, the response of tropical lakes, and shallow lakes in particular, to changing magnitude of environmental stressors is a major research gap. The present study investigates the effect of lake volume reduction and increasing salinity on the productivity of a shallow tropical lake and ultimately on the GHGs dynamics. Stable oxygen isotopic composition of lake water indicated that evaporative water loss was the major cause for lake volume reduction, which eventually led to increasing ion concentration and salinity. The dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen pools also increased as the lake volume reduced, leading to increased primary productivity when the lake was shallow and salty. Consequently, the availability of organic matter enhanced CH4 and CO2 but limited N2O production. However, the strong positive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 masked the weak N2O sink during the productive period and resulted in an overall net source of GHGs (CO2 equivalent). This study bridges lake hydrology with its biogeochemistry and highlights the significance of shallow tropical lakes as conduits of GHGs in a future warming scenario.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				DEC 1	2025	286		1						122724	10.1016/j.envres.2025.122724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122724								40886793					WOS:001568911500002

Although the degradation of P-containing dissolved organic matter (P-DOM) significantly influences geogenic P enrichment, the seasonal variations of P-DOM and their effects on geogenic P dynamics remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the optical and molecular characteristics of DOM and P-DOM, coupled with hydrogeochemistry and carbon isotopes across dry, normal, and wet seasons, in a geogenic P-affected aquifer system within the central Yangtze Plain. The results showed that the concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and dissolved inorgnaic phosphorus (DIP) in groundwater progressively increased from the dry season to wet seasons. During the dry season, the humification degree of DOM was higher, with DIP enrichment mainly associated with the transformation of highly unsaturated compounds and polyphenols. In the normal season, enhanced leaching introduced some highly unsaturated compounds into groundwater, during which a significant negative correlation was observed between DIP concentrations and highly unsaturated compounds and polycyclic aromatics. During the wet season, the freshness of DOM markedly increased, while the percentage of PDOM reaches its minimum. At this stage, DIP enrichment was mainly associated with highly unsaturated compounds. Rainfall-induced leaching and sediment disturbance from lake backflow introduced aromatic compounds into the groundwater. Simultaneously, the intensified interaction between surface water and groundwater allowed lake water to bring oxidizing agents into groundwater, thereby altering environment conditions conducive to P-DOM degradation and ultimately increasing groundwater P concentrations. Additionally, compounds positively correlated with DIP concentration showed increased H/C and decreased O/C ratios across seasonal variations, confirming greater P-DOM degradation during this period. This study provides a new temporal perspective on the geochemical behavior of P in groundwater, emphasizing the significant influence of seasonal variations on P cycling.

J	Zehnich, M; Spielhagen, RF; Bauch, HA; Kuhnert, H				Zehnich, Marc; Spielhagen, Robert F.; Bauch, Henning A.; Kuhnert, Henning			Arctic Ocean freshwater export and its relation to AMOC over the last two glacial cycles	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Fram Strait, between NE Greenland and Svalbard, is the main passage for freshwater export from the Arctic Ocean (AO). Here we report results from the first high-resolution multiproxy study of a sediment record from 81 degrees N in this Arctic Gateway to reconstruct the freshwater and environmental variability since similar to 200 ka. Based on highly resolved stable isotope records from benthic and planktic foraminifers we link prominent isotopic events in marine isotope stages (MIS) 6-3 to times of strong freshwater input to the AO from the disintegration of circum-Arctic ice sheets and from the discharge of previously ice-dammed lakes in northern Eurasia. Additional short-term events point at the injection of low-salinity waters at intermediate depth along the NE Greenland continental margin, possibly caused by the release of sediment-laden, freshwater-enriched hyperpycnal flows on the shelf and upper continental margin. Changes in the deposition of foraminifers and coarse ice-rafted terrestrial debris at site PS93/016 document highly variable conditions in the NW Fram Strait with sedimentation from icebergs during times of large-scale glaciation around the Arctic and with other intervals dominated by sea ice. Foraminifer-rich sediments even suggest the development of seasonally open waters (polynyas) during certain periods. Four time intervals with a particularly strong and long-lasting freshwater export from the Arctic Ocean can be traced to the western Nordic Seas where modern deepwater formation occurs. The good temporal correlation of these intervals with weakenings of the deepwater circulation in the North Atlantic makes a strong case for a decisive role of Arctic freshwater export in the history of the global climate system of the last 200 ka, in particular as a trigger for instabilities of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				DEC 1	2025	369								109612	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109612	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109612													WOS:001592196000001

Yet, in catchments subjected to large-scale vegetation restoration, the seasonal dynamics and driving forces governing riverine DOM remain obscure. In this study, a vegetation-restored small watershed on the Loess Plateau was investigated using DOM optical metrics coupled with parallel factor (PARAFAC) fluorescence analysis to unravel the seasonality of DOM sources and composition. Spatially, DOM exhibited progressive enrichment from headwaters to downstream reaches, concomitant with a shift from predominantly labile to more recalcitrant components. Terrestrially derived humic substances dominated the DOM pool (77.30-86.57 % of total fluorescence), with the wet season exhibiting peak fluorescence intensity alongside the lowest freshness index (beta/alpha) values. The dry season was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein-like components and biodegradable fractions, whereas the normal season featured aged, humified terrestrial inputs. Water temperature and rainfall emerged as the principal drivers of these seasonal contrasts. These findings provide a theoretical framework for predicting DOM dynamics and inform adaptive management strategies for restored vegetation in fluvial landscapes.

The Anil River Estuary (ARE) is located on the Brazilian equatorial margin on the northern coast of Brazil and is influenced by semidiurnal macrotides from the South Atlantic and the river waters of the Anil River, which are highly urbanized and have many anthropic pressures. Between 2022 and 2023, six sampling campaigns were conducted at eight points across two sectors (SI - eutrophic; SII - hypertrophic) during the dry and rainy seasons. The functional diversity (FD) of the community was assessed using indices FEve, FDiv, and FDis, based on a matrix of functional traits and species density. The ARE phytoplankton community comprised 234taxa in six taxonomic groups, with diatoms being the most abundant (57.69 %), followed by Cyanobacteria (14 %) and Myozoa (8.5 %). Twenty-five Reynolds functional groups (FGs) were identified, significantly influenced by salinity and pH, with groups M and X1 being the most representative. The FGs varied between sectors and seasons, with SII recording 85 % of the species within 25 groups during the rainy season, while SI showed 76 % in 23 groups. Functional traits allowed the formation of three major groups: (I) species from hypertrophic environments (<20 mu m), dominated by cyanobacteria and charophytes; (II) marine diatoms from eutrophic environments (>20 mu m); and (III) species from estuarine waters, including euglenophytes and chlorophytes (>20 mu m). The study highlights the relationship between the functional composition of phytoplankton and environmental conditions in an estuary impacted by urbanization and eutrophication.

While microbial-driven biogeochemical cycles in stormwater are constrained by taxonomic diversity and environmental variability, the interplay between hydrogeochemical dynamics and microbial functional genes during storage remains poorly characterized. In this study, an in situ stormwater self-purification system was constructed to investigate seasonal water quality evolution, microbial community dynamics, and functional gene regulation in Shenzhen, China. Compared with continuous rainfall events, initial postdrought stormwater events resulted in significantly elevated pollutant loads. Dissolved organic matter analysis revealed that endogenous contaminants accounted for 76 % of the total contaminants, characterized by high microbial bioavailability and low humification after 14 days of storage. The storage of samples favors the enrichment of functional microorganisms such as Plancomycetota, Verrucomicrobiota and Proteobacteria. A quantitative assessment of 62 functional genes linked to carbon (C)/nitrogen (N)/sulfur (S) cycling identified temperature, oxidation-reduction potential ammonia nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen as critical drivers of microbial community succession and gene abundance. N cycle genes presented heightened sensitivity to environmental fluctuations, with increased stability and metabolic activity observed in wet season samples. Comparative analysis demonstrated that deep tunnel samples presented more stable functional gene profiles and enriched microbial consortia relative to their surface counterparts. These findings elucidate the mechanistic relationships between hydrogeochemical variables and microbial functional resilience in stormwater storage systems. This work advances the process-level understanding of biochemical cycles mediated by C, N and S transformations, offering actionable insights for optimizing urban drainage infrastructure and microbial-mediated pollution control strategies.					xun, zhang/AAG-6923-2021; Zhang, Xiaomei/KMX-8564-2024														0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV 15	2025	285		3						122509	10.1016/j.envres.2025.122509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122509								40774558					WOS:001558377700005

This study presents high-resolution sterol records from Lake Tuofengling, a crater lake in northeast China, offering new insights into the evolution of lake productivity and algal community since the Last Glacial Maximum. The sedimentary record reveals abundant sterols, including cholesterol, brassicasterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol, and dinosterol, which serve as valuable paleolimnological proxies. A significant decline in the sitosterol/stigmasterol ratio since the Bolling-Allerod interstadial indicates a substantial increase in autochthonous contributions, coinciding with rising lake levels. A notable increase of the productivity of dinoflagellates relative to diatoms occurred around 10.5 cal ka BP, as indicated by sharp decrease in biogenic silica content and increase in dinosterol/sitosterol. This ecological shift was likely driven by changes in growing season temperatures and nutrient availability. The period between similar to 6-4.2 cal ka BP was marked by significantly higher sterol abundances, indicating elevated lake productivity that was probably linked to increased precipitation during the mid-Holocene. Subsequently, around 4.2 cal ka BP, there was a sudden decrease in sterol concentrations and corresponding lake primary productivity, which can be ascribed to a sensitive response of the lake ecosystem to the 4.2-ka millennial event. Since approximately 3 cal ka BP, intensified human activities and increased dust deposition in northern China have significantly impacted the lake's ecological dynamics, resulting in high-amplitude fluctuations in sterol concentrations and a gradual increase in abundance of brassicasterol relative to dinosterol. The observed decoupling between diatomdinoflagellate relative abundances and overall lake productivity demonstrates the complex responses of aquatic ecosystems to both natural and anthropogenic environmental changes.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022														0277-3791	1873-457X				NOV 15	2025	368								109551	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109551													WOS:001545174100001

To address this knowledge gap, this study selected the WLFZ (150-170 m) of Danjiangkou Reservoir and conducted large-scale sampling of soil and shoreline water samples before the rainy season. The aim was to investigate the distribution and characteristics of MPs in the WLFZ and to identify the key influencing factors. The results showed that the abundance of soil MPs in the WLFZ ranged from 144 to 1050 items/kg. The MPs abundance in the Dan Reservoir was higher than that in the Han Reservoir. Specifically, the mainstream exhibited higher MPs abundance than the tributaries in the Dan Reservoir, whereas the tributaries in the Han Reservoir were larger than the mainstream. The abundance of soil MPs in bare land and farmland was significantly higher than in grassland and woodland. The MPs are predominantly the size of 0.1-1 mm, the shape of fibers and pellets, the color of transparent and blue, and the polymer types are mainly polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). Among all influencing factors, human activities (distance from village and population density) and land use was identified as determinants of MPs abundance. The hydrological environment of the reservoir, including water level fluctuations, reservoir bays and banks, and mainstreams and tributaries, influenced the redistribution of MPs. This study systematically reveals the distribution of MPs pollution in the WLFZ and provides a key scientific basis for the prevention and control of MPs pollution.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				NOV 5	2025	499								140056	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.140056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.140056								41056722					WOS:001591614800009
J	Guran, SH				Guran, Saman H.			Middle Palaeolithic Human occupations, cultural behaviours and demographic dynamics during MIS 5a to late 3 in the Bawa Yawan Rockshelter, Kermanshah, West-Central Zagros Mountains	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Despite many years of research into the Middle Palaeolithic in the Zagros Mountains, numerous aspects of this period have not yet been sufficiently investigated. The topics of Middle Palaeolithic's cultural behavioures, temporal changes, chronology, and the nature of the transition from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic in this region have led to various opinions and debates. Three seasons of archaeological excavations at the Bawa Yawan Rockshelter, located in the west-central Zagros, have uncovered a continuous stratigraphic sequence spanning from the Middle to the Epipalaeolithic periods. The site yielded in situ Neanderthal remains along with a substantial assemblage of lithic and faunal materials. The findings suggest a relatively homogeneous Mousterian lithic trajectory throughout the Middle Palaeolithic period, with slight variations likely reflecting differences in hunting strategies. Furthermore, these data indicate a cyclical pattern in population size dynamics, likely in response to climatic variations during the late Marine Isotope Stage 5a to the middle of 3. The data reveal that the Neanderthals, after a relatively substantial period in late MIS 5, experienced a demographic stagnation in MIS 4. The same data shows that their population grew significantly just before extinction around 45,000 to 40,000 years ago. This article represents a step forward in understanding human evolution during the Late Pleistocene in the Zagros Mountains, within the territory of Southwestern Asia.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				NOV 1	2025	367								109523	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109523													WOS:001539838500001

This study offers a comprehensive assessment of microplastic pollution in sediments from Lakes Ziway, Hawassa, and Koka in the Ethiopian Rift valley. This work aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics as a function of surrounding land use and seasonal changes. Samples collected during wet and dry seasons contained 20 to 740 particles kg(-1), with Lake Koka exhibiting the highest mean concentration (454.17 +/- 123.92 particles kg(-1)), followed by Hawassa (350.42 +/- 149.95 particles kg(-1)) and Ziway (282.78 +/- 151.10 particles kg(-1)). Wet-season levels significantly exceeded dry-season concentrations (chi(2) = 1482.0, p < 0.001), reflecting the role of surface runoff in pollutant transport. Secondary microplastics predominated, mainly as fibers (63.8 %) and fragments (32.5 %), with polyamides (41.9 %), polyethylene (30.4 %), and polypropylene (21.7 %) as the dominant polymers. The study revealed widespread contamination with marked spatial, seasonal, and compositional variability. Pollution Load Index values confirmed severe contamination (PLI >1), with Lake Koka (4.76) reflecting diffuse pollution, compared to more localized inputs at Ziway (3.46) and Hawassa (4.10). These findings underscore the influence of anthropogenic activities and hydrological processes, highlighting the urgent need for targeted waste management and further research into source identification, polymer degradation, ecological and public health risks.

This study employs multi-source remote sensing data to present the first long-term (1991-2023) hydrological investigation of Anglaren Co, a typical endorheic lake in the western Tibetan Plateau. By integrating Sentinel-3 SRAL, Sentinel-1 SAR, and Landsat imagery, lake water levels and surface areas were derived through statistical anomaly removal and a multi-source imagery-based area extraction method. A water level-area relationship curve was developed to estimate water volume changes, and the driving mechanisms were analyzed using the water balance equation combined with meteorological data. The results show that during 1991-2023, wet season and dry season lake areas exhibited significant increasing trends (p < 0.001). Specifically, the wet-season area expanded by 4.7 % (from 501.71 km(2) to 512.68 km(2)), while the dry-season area increased by 1.0 % (from 504.47 km(2) to 510.98 km(2)), with expansion mainly concentrated in regions near river inflows. Compared to 1994, the water level in 2023 increased by approximately 2 m, with the water volume rising by over 1 billion m(3), with the most significant growth occurring during 2017-2019. From 2000 to 2023, surface water inflow continuously rose, with an average annual rise of 63 million m(3) during the wet season, particularly pronounced during 2016-2019. Rising temperatures primarily influence water volume dynamics by accelerating glacier melting and causing permafrost degradation. These mechanisms substantially enhance lake inflow, emphasizing the profound impacts of climate warming on watershed hydrological dynamics. This study highlights the pivotal role of climate change in shaping lacustrine hydrological dynamics and offers robust empirical evidence to deepen understanding of regional lake evolution and its responses to climate variability.

J	Jansen, L; Tromas, N; Strecker, A; Shapiro, J				Jansen, Lara; Tromas, Nicolas; Strecker, Angela; Shapiro, Jesse			Shifts in bacterioplankton during cyanobacterial blooms reflect bloom toxicity and lake trophic state	HARMFUL ALGAE												Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (cyanoHABs) typically occur in human-impacted eutrophic lakes suffering from nutrient pollution, but they also occur in pristine lakes spanning the trophic gradient. The drivers and dynamics of blooms in these oligotrophic lakes remain understudied. CyanoHABs alter the composition of bacterioplankton with increases in specific cyanobacteria strains, as well as shifts in heterotrophic taxa. Bacterioplankton community shifts during cyanoHABs can be somewhat predictable but have been only studied in a limited number of lakes, mostly eutrophic and impacted by development. The Cascade Mountains (USA) offer a novel setting to examine microcystin variation and shifts in bacterioplankton communities across trophic in relatively undeveloped lakes with documented cyanoHABs. Using physicochemical measurements, time-integrated toxin monitoring, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we explored associations of bacterioplankton communities with cyanoHABs and toxins within a season, as well as across lakes and years. In Cascade Mountain lakes, bacterioplankton communities and cyanoHABs varied spatially, reflecting differences in trophic state, among other factors. The cyanotoxin microcystin exceeded the drinking water chronic exposure level (1 ppb) in two lakes, during which cyanobacteria exceeded 20 % of the bacterioplankton community. Bacterioplankton composition changed notably during the cyanoHAB events, varying with bloom toxicity and lake trophic state. These compositional differences were not only driven by increases in cyanobacteria, specifically from the order Nostocales, but also heterotrophic bacteria such as from the orders Burkholderiales and Cytophagales. Therefore, bacterioplankton composition can potentially be consistent indicators of cyanoHABs and toxicity, more so than climatic factors across lakes that span substantial trophic gradients.

Parametrization and model development for simulating redox reactions related to degradation of natural organic matter in managed aquifer recharge	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is commonly used as a treatment method to remove organic matter from surface water for a drinking water supply by filtering the water through soils in an aquifer. Groundwater, solute transport, and natural organic matter (NOM) degradation models are available for describing the processes, but their applications for practical assessment of MAR sites and their design have been limited. The objective of this study was to model the NOM processes, quantify the impacts of individual drivers on degradation, and identify the model parameters mainly controlling concentrations of organic matter, oxygen, Fe, and Mn. The methodological approach was to construct a 1-D reactive transport model for total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved oxygen (DO), Fe, Mn, and heat to address the key NOM processes in a lake-aquifer system, where lake water naturally infiltrates into an aquifer. The model was implemented with generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and Sobol's method to test the parameter sensitivity.The results showed that in addition to reactions in the aquifer, the lake bottom sediment model played a key role in bank infiltration through its control of DO concentrations. The model was able to represent the diminishing effect of strong temperature seasonality and smoothening of the temperature-related concentration variations in the aquifer. On the other hand, the model produced seasonal TOC dynamics close to the lake-aquifer interface, which was not detected in measurements. With GLUE, the TOC and DO concentrations in the model were most sensitive to the seepage velocity, the hydrodynamic dispersivity, and the reaction rate parameters controlling the oxygen-related degradation of TOC in the lake sediment and the aquifer. Sobol's total order indexes also showed sensitivity to parameters that control the temperature dependency of reaction rates. In addition to these parameters, Mn and Fe concentrations were sensitive to reaction rate factors for the dissolution of Mn in the aquifer, but the result was less clear. The resulting identification of the key parameters provides a benchmark for the calibration of bank filtration models in the Nordic context.

However, a comprehensive understanding of plant water sources at different altitudes, especially in cold alpine regions, remains limited. Based on MixSIAR model, we quantify the seasonal water sources of dominant plants along altitude gradients and analyze the controlling factors in the Qinghai Lake Basin. The results indicated that in June, the alpine steppe (ASP), alpine meadow and steppe transition (AMS), and alpine meadow (AM) plants above 3600 m utilized deep, middle and deep soil water, respectively. In July, ASP and AMS plants extracted 38.1 % and 42.25 % of deep and middle soil water, respectively. Alpine desert (ADS) plant primarily utilized middle soil water from June to July and extract 43.3 % of water from this layer in September. Below 3600 m, the dominant species in sandy land (SL) and Achnatherum splendens steppe (AST) shifted their water extraction from shallow to deeper soil layer, especially in the middle and late growing season. The AS plant shifted the water uptake to topsoil as soil water content increased among ecosystems. Along the altitude gradient, plants primary utilized 46.66 % of shallow soil water. Water source shifts were driven by water availability below 3600 m and energy constraints above 3600 m. Under climate warming, plants in the ADS, AM, AMS, and ASP ecosystems, which rely on early frost or snowmelt, face water stress risk during the late growing season, requiring intensive monitoring. In contrast, coexisting species in SL experienced increased water competition and need adaptive strategies. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing water resource management in alpine regions.

HMs sources and pollution characteristics exhibit considerable complexity under varying climatic conditions and regional environmental contexts. This study investigates the migration patterns, sources, and spatial distribution of HMs in sediments from representative estuaries and bays in China between 2017 and 2020. The results show regional contamination levels vary due to runoff and land-based pollutants. According to the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), Cd exhibited the most severe contamination, particularly in the Pearl River Estuary, the Hangzhou Bay, and the Yangtze River Estuary (moderately to highly polluted). Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) showed industrial sources contributed most to HMs (46.7 %), followed by natural (30.7 %), agricultural (12.3 %), and shipping sources (10.3 %). Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and spatial distribution patterns further demonstrated a more pronounced distance-decay relationship during the rainy season. Mass load estimations showed that the Yangtze River Estuary (215,111.2 t) and the Pearl River Estuary (551,271.3 t) had the highest pollutant loads, suggesting their potential role as secondary sources of pollution for adjacent regions. This study offers a comprehensive view of HMs contamination in sediments from major Chinese estuaries and bays, supporting environmental protection and risk warning efforts.																			0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV	2025	220								118420	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2025.118420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2025.118420								40644897					WOS:001537341400001

It requires regular monitoring due to the potential threat of algal bloom and cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll-a is a proxy parameter that shows the lake's trophic state, hence primary productivity. The objective of this study was to compare Gon's method and ocean color algorithms and select suitable remote sensing techniques to monitor chl-a concentration in water bodies. Google Earth Engine along with Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery were used to retrieve satellite data. In situ, chl-a data for model calibration and validation was collected from 29 sampling locations in the lake according to the seasons. We calibrated Gon's algorithm and then used Sentinel-2 MSI imagery to produce chl-a maps. We noticed a major difference between the suitability of ocean color and Gons algorithms in estimating chl-a in Lake Kyoga. Ocean color was less accurate because it assumes that the blue-green band ratio linearly responded to chl-a abundance, and this made it suitable for relatively clear waters such as oceans or oligotrophic lakes, not Lake Kyoga. The Gons algorithm was more applicable in turbid productive waters such as Lake Kyoga and estimated chl-a accurately. These results are very important for real-time monitoring of climate-sensitive lakes such as Lake Kyoga, which are also subjected to severe catchment degradation.

Like many natural habitats, the Ashtamudi wetland is increasingly threatened by human activities and urbanization. This study provides a valuable baseline for future research on organic pollutants in Indian wetlands and highlights the importance of implementing effective measures to control these toxic substances. Surface sediments were collected from 11 stations in Ashtamudi Lake during both the monsoon and nonmonsoon seasons, and the average concentration of PAHs in nonmonsoon and monsoon was found to be 872.25+785.13 ng/g and 504.85+537.28 ng/g, respectively. Ashtamudi Lake may be categorized as moderately to highly polluted with PAHs. Diagnostic ratio, PCAMLR, and HCA methods characterized the possible pollution sources. Accordingly, vehicular emissions, coal combustion, and petrogenic sources are the major sources of PAHs. Ecological risk analysis showed moderate to high ecological risk in the Ashtamudi wetland. Health risk assessment revealed that the ingestion of these compounds poses hazardous noncarcinogenic risks, especially for children, and BaP was found to pose significant carcinogenic risks to public health.

Habeeb			Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surficial sediments of Vembanad wetland ecosystem, southwest coast of India: An integrated assessment of dissemination, source apportionment, ecological and public health implication	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The present study assessed the dissemination, sources, ecological and human health risks of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments collected from Vembanad Lake. Total PAHs varied from 47.1 to 424.4 ng/g during monsoon and 155.9 to 749.4 ng/g during nonmonsoon, which remain below the levels found in most other sediment studies conducted globally. Strong positive correlations were found between PAHs and TOC (r = 0.457, p < 0.05), silt (r = 0.521, p < 0.01), and clay (r = 0.533, p < 0.05), suggesting that PAHs are strongly absorbed onto fine-grained particles. The origin of PAHs in Vembanad Lake is predominantly attributed to diverse anthropogenic activities, including industrial discharges, domestic sewage, port operations, vehicular emissions, oil spills, and runoff from surrounding urban and agricultural areas. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that combustion sources (coal or biomass combustion: 50.69 %), vehicular emissions (48.08 %) and petrogenic sources (1.23 %) are the main sources of PAHs. According to sediment quality assessment, acenaphthylene (Acy) in monsoon seasons exhibited occasional biological effects, while pyrene (Py) did so in the nonmonsoon seasons. Noncarcinogenic risks due to PAHs were very low (HI <1). While carcinogenic risks were moderate, BaP was found to pose significant carcinogenic risks (ILCR >10-3). Thus, the study area requires continuous monitoring and pollution control measurements. This study presents the first comprehensive health risk assessment of PAHs in the Vembanad wetland, offering valuable insights into potential human exposure and associated risks, and addressing a critical gap in regional environmental research.

However, a number of Paleolithic cultural remains have been found in and around the BDJL, suggestive of earlier occupations by human foragers. Unfortunately, most of these artifacts were surface collected and lack reliable radiometric dates, making it difficult to further understand when prehistoric peoples entered the desert and how they survived once there. As a result of recent multidisciplinary fieldwork, eleven new lithic sites (BDJL1-11) were discovered in the southeastern margin of the BDJL. Four of these were initially excavated and found to contain buried Paleoliths, and the other seven sites had stone tools distributed on the surface. The stone artifact collections include microblades, small flakes, and scrapers, representing typical stone tool types of the Late Paleolithic in northern China. We applied Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) 14C dating to the buried sites' stratigraphy and OSL dating to the underlying stratigraphy of the surface sites. The results suggest that: human foragers obtained water and possibly hunted near small lakes that were present in interdune basins (BDJL1-2) after 10.1 ka; humans settled in the rockshelter (BDJL3) and the cave (BDJL4) in the mountain basin around 5.9 ka and between 6.4 and 6.2 cal ka BP, separately; foragers hunted and used water in the proluvial fan margin with relatively favorable water and vegetation conditions (BDJL5-11) between approximately 9.3 ka and 7.6 ka, even later; humans collected stone materials and possibly used water along seasonal streams at the proluvial fan outlet (MDLS1-7) after approximately 7.3 ka. Temperature and precipitation simulated by Trace-21ka indicate that the climate of the BDJL was relatively warm and humid during the Early and Middle Holocene. The combination of better moisture conditions and increasing population density as evidenced by the increased number of microblade sites in the Yellow River Basin likely drove the migration and dispersal of human populations into the desert. This study reveals the diversity in resource utilization and the relative abundance of different activities by Late Paleolithic hunter-gatherers during the Early and Middle Holocene in the currently resource-scarce BDJL. The resource exploitation patterns of the BDJL human foraging groups provide new insights into prehistoric human adaptations to desert regions in northwestern China.

To address this, the study conducted seasonal observations of CO2 fluxes in lakes with varying altitudes, areas, and salinity levels. Firstly, the study found significant seasonal variations in FCO2 across different lake. The average FCO2 values of the observed lake were 37.12 mmol/m2/d, 98.19 mmol/m2/d, and 68.05 mmol/m2/d during the thaw, rainy and freezing periods, respectively. Notably, lakes at high altitudes, with large areas, and medium salinity exhibited negative FCO2 values, indicating their role as carbon sinks. In contrast, lakes at low altitudes, with medium areas, and high salinity showed positive FCO2 values, indicating their role as carbon sources. For high-altitude, large-area, and medium-salinity lakes, FCO2 changes were primarily influenced by salinity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH, and water temperature. In contrast, for low-altitude and medium-area lakes, the factors varied across seasons. The observed seasonal variations of lake FCO2 were mainly regulated by the dynamic balance of lake carbonate caused by water temperature. These findings highlight the significant impact of lake attributes on the seasonal variation of FCO2 in QTP lakes. These results provide crucial support for assessing changes in lake carbon sources and sinks in the QTP, as well as the underlying processes and mechanisms.

J	Yang, JR; Yang, QL; Hu, FC; Shao, JM				Yang, Junran; Yang, Qinli; Hu, Feichi; Shao, Junming			An Interpretable framework of Soil moisture estimation based on Mixture-of-Experts (ISMoE): a case study on the Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Soil moisture plays a critical role in regulating land-atmosphere exchanges, but its accurate estimation still remains challenging. To better understand soil moisture dynamics and estimate soil moisture more accurately, this study proposes an Interpretable framework of Soil moisture estimation based on Mixture-of-Experts (ISMoE) and investigates its performance across three climatic zones on the Tibetan Plateau. The MoE model consists of multiple expert models and a routing network. Each expert model is designed as an independent deep spatial-temporal neural network (CNN-LSTM) that captures the unique contribution of a specific environmental factor to soil moisture dynamics. The routing network then dynamically weighs the expert model outputs to generate a final integrated soil moisture estimation. Results show that ISMoE achieved CC values of 0.858, 0.863, and 0.958 in NGARI, MAQU, and NAQU regions, respectively. ISMoE outperformed multiple baselines (standard CNN-LSTM model, mean_expert ensemble model, SMAPL3, and ERA5-Land data). The model's interpretability was validated through the routing network's weights. The key, region-specific drivers assigned with high importance (weight) by the model are as follows: snow and radiation processes in the arid NGARI region; lake thermal effects and precipitation in the tundra NAQU region; and wind patterns and lake mixing processes in the monsoon-influenced MAQU region. The identified key drivers align with previous study, and the weights revealed distinct, temporally consistent seasonal patterns in each region. The proposed ISMoE improved both accuracy and interpretability of soil moisture estimation model, which provides a promising way to enhance model reliability and valuable dataset for regional water resources research.

Pollen assemblages indicated a cool temperate climate characterized by a mixed forest composed of coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved trees. The presence of boreal (subalpine) elements such as Abies, Picea, and Pinus subgen. Haploxylon suggested localized or seasonal cold episodes, reflecting climate instability consistent with the broader Dark Age Cold Period (DACP; ca. 400-765 CE). Agricultural indicator taxa, including Fagopyrum (buckwheat), Perilla, Cucurbita (pumpkin), and Oryza (rice), were primarily recovered from the palace-related administrative complex. However, archaeological and environmental evidence suggested that these crops were not cultivated within the fortress, but were transported from surrounding farmlands for storage or ritual use. The thick rice straw layers (similar to 100 cm) and the associated fungal spores within the wooden storage features supported this interpretation. The NPP assemblages, including Glomus, freshwater algae, and aquatic invertebrate remains, revealed signs of soil erosion, stagnant water conditions, and active water management. These findings highlight the role of the fortress as a strategic administrative and hydrological hub during climatically unstable periods. Overall, this study demonstrates how environmental stress associated with the DACP may have influenced land use, food management, and social organization within the late Baekje society.																			2352-409X					NOV	2025	67								105422	10.1016/j.jasrep.2025.105422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2025.105422													WOS:001585858700003

Evaluation of the Sentinel-1 SAR-based snow depth product over the Northern Hemisphere	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Active microwave remote sensing techniques, especially synthetic aperture radar (SAR), are valid tools for monitoring snow depth (SD) because of their high spatial resolution and day-night all-weather monitoring. The first SAR (C-band)-based SD product (C-snow), which covers all mountain ranges in the Northern Hemisphere, has been used as a reference dataset in many applications, such as building SD retrieval algorithms, acting as training samples for machine learning models, and improving passive microwave-based retrievals. However, the performance of the C-snow dataset over the Northern Hemisphere is unknown and remains to be evaluated. In this study, we integrated several ground-based SD datasets and also collected airborne lidar surveys (ASO) to assess the accuracy of C-snow SD retrievals. Moreover, we quantitatively analyzed the influence of various factors, such as landscape, terrain, dry/wet state, etc., on the SD retrievals. The results revealed that compared with ground-based SD measurements, the overall unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) and bias values of C-snow in the Northern Hemisphere ranged from 60.98 to 68.18 cm and-22.93 to-9.81 cm, respectively, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.52 to 0.58. Compared with the ASO observations, the ubRMSE and bias were 107.2 cm and-91.72 cm, respectively. The performances of the C-snow product exhibited spatial differences due to the topography (elevation, terrain slope, and undulation), landcover types (especially ice and forest), wet snow and availability of time series Sentinel-1 observations (affecting the C-snow retrieval algorithm). Moreover, C-snow retrievals tend to underestimate the SD in the late snow season annually because of the decreasing snow index (SI) caused by wet snow or snow metamorphism, although the SD still increases. The performance analysis in this study will be useful for determining the dominant factors impacting SD retrievals, evaluating and building SD retrieval models, and understanding the spatiotemporal distribution and changes in snowpack in mountains.					; Jiang, Lingmei/L-6099-2016	shi, jian cheng/0000-0002-6163-2912; Jiang, Lingmei/0000-0002-9847-9034													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2025	661		A						133593	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133593													WOS:001504904400002

Although the mechanism of heavy metal enrichment in lake environments has been widely explored as a toxic and highly accumulating pollutant, there is a lack of in-depth research on the possible occurrence and behavior patterns of heavy metals in these lakes during freezing, which may differ from those in non-freezing lakes. This study applied various evaluation methods such as sediment quality benchmarking method, potential ecological risk index, and geographic detector to comprehensively evaluate the occurrence characteristics, toxicity, and ecological detector of heavy metals in sediments of three major lakes (Hulun Lake, Wuliangsuhai and Daihai) in northern China during freezing and ice free periods. The results showed that, heavy metals were transported along ice-watersediment in freshwater lakes, due to the freeze-concentration effect formed by the icing process, which made the heavy metal content in freshwater lakes during the glacial period, significantly higher than during ice-free period. However, high salt lakes are controlled by high salt water intrusion, which affects the migration process of heavy metals in sediments through competitive adsorption, ion exchange and solubility, resulting in significantly lower contents in brackish lakes, during the glacial period than during ice-free period, suggesting that icing and salinity affect the mobility of heavy metals. The biotoxicity effect and ecological risk showed that, the heavy metal composite contamination of lake is controlled by the degree of lake shrinkage, water exchange capacity and water exchange cycle, in addition to human activities. The results have significance in revealing the cycling and fate of heavy metals in global lake systems.

J	Behrens, D; Battalio, R				Behrens, Dane; Battalio, Robert			Progress in modeling coastal lagoon mouth morphology and hydrology using a quantified conceptual approach and long-term data across multiple sites	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper presents a computationally-efficient model that predicts the physical conditions of coastal lagoons to inform management decisions. The model advances previous approaches by leveraging long-term datasets measured across multiple sites. Globally, communities in the vicinity of coastal lagoons must balance peopleserving and ecology-serving management activities, which are complex and not aligned. These issues are compounded by long-term coastal erosion and sea level rise. The model approach described here is termed a 'quantified conceptual model' (QCM) because it relies on a simplified representation of water and sediment fluxes controlling the lagoon hydrology. The QCM hindcasts and forecasts mouth closure and water levels in intermittently-closed coastal lagoons. It is a modular and parametric approach built around a water balance for the lagoon and sand balance for the lagoon mouth. It exists in the niche between the classical parametric tools presented in the 1950s through 1970s and more recent two- and three-dimensional model approaches. The model resulted from several decades of applied research in California, utilizing newly available long-term records of lagoon behavior. The goal of this paper is to test the accuracy of this approach in a broad range of lagoons with different characteristics. We test it at nine lagoon sites in California with observation records of 3 to 22 years. At all sites, the QCM is a better predictor of mouth closure than classical measures, and is an accurate predictor of lagoon water levels. Based on our experience with careful application of the QCM and vetting results with other methods, we have found it appropriate for assessing engineering feasibility, design, and environmental impact analyses.																			0169-555X	1872-695X				OCT 15	2025	487								109915	10.1016/j.geomorph.2025.109915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2025.109915													WOS:001539734400002

Paleoclimate records provide an important out-of-sample target to test models in climates with different boundary conditions and improve model physics. General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP) underestimate temperature changes in tropical Africa during key periods in the past, calling into question model predictions of future climate change in this region. We compare a new suite of 8 temperature records from tropical African lakes derived from glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) to simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21 kya) and midHolocene (MH, 6 kya) from PMIP3 and PMIP4, and find that there is significant proxy/model temperature disagreement during both periods; GCMs are over 2 degrees C cooler than proxies during the MH, and 2 degrees C warmer than proxies during the LGM. This could arise from issues with GCMs or the GDGT records. We use a proxy system model (PSM) to investigate multiple potential sources of proxy uncertainty, including non-stationarity in the relationship between air and lake temperature, seasonality, and calibration error. We find that proxy system error can account for significant portions of this discrepancy during the MH (up to 80%) assuming the maximum possible error for each potential source, but not during the LGM. Our findings highlight potential areas for improvement in interpretation of proxy records by explicitly modeling and quantifying uncertainty in reconstructed temperatures.																			0277-3791	1873-457X				OCT 15	2025	366								109426	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109426													WOS:001528487200003

Zooplankton Assemblage Structure of the Lower Mississippi River and Floodplain in Relation to Site Hydrological Connection	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The pattern of flow or hydrological connection between a river's main channel and its floodplain can vary seasonally and spatially in frequency, duration, direction, and magnitude. Such variation is expected to promote habitat and biotic diversity. We examined this proposition in relation to zooplankton assemblage structure and environmental parameters in the Lower Mississippi River System (LMRS). Over an 18-month period, we sampled channel and off-channel floodplain lake habitats representing four categories of mean annual connection duration to the main channel (MC), or "potamal states," ranging from frequently to infrequently connected. We compared zooplankton assemblages in terms of density, richness, dominance, and turnover, and identified habitat conditions associated with variation across potamal states. Principal findings were as follows: (1) we identified 70 distinct zooplankton taxa, most not previously recorded in the LMRS; (2) assemblage structure aligned strongly with habitat conditions influenced by the MC; (3) the most pronounced differences among potamal states occurred between channel habitats and floodplain lakes collectively; (4) mean zooplankton density and richness were lowest in channel habitats, regardless of season or river stage, and highest in the least frequently connected lakes; (5) indicator taxa distinguished assemblages among potamal states; and (6) densities of large crustaceans were markedly lower than those recorded in the only previous study of LMRS zooplankton assemblages, conducted 35 years earlier. Our results highlight the critical role of variable hydrological connection in shaping habitat conditions and promoting biological diversity in large river-floodplain ecosystems.																			1535-1459	1535-1467				2025 OCT 15	2025										10.1002/rra.70066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.70066		OCT 2025											WOS:001593971000001

Macroinvertebrates were collected at two sampling stations impacted by fish farms and a control station without fish farming, and physicochemical variables were measured in situ. Water samples were analysed in the laboratory for nutrients and chlorophyll-a. Only turbidity, water transparency, dissolved oxygen, and phosphate significantly differed between the three stations. Three macroinvertebrate phyla (Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Annelida), nine orders (Gastropoda, Diptera, Decapoda, Annelida, Odonata, Ephemeroptera, Coleoptera, Heteroptera, and Hemiptera), and 37 families were identified. Three groups, Diptera, Gastropoda, and Odonata, were abundant and dominated both cage and control stations. Predators, collector-gatherers, and scavengers were more dominant than scrapers and shredders. The composition of macroinvertebrate communities significantly differed between the three stations, but not between the fish cage and control stations. Moreover, there were no significant seasonal differences in community composition. Accordingly, cage farming does not yet seem to pose a threat to Lake Kivu's ecological condition. Nonetheless, we recommend frequent monitoring of water and sediment quality to detect early signals and avoid fish farms impacting the ecosystem health of the lake.																			1434-2944	1522-2632				2025 OCT 14	2025										10.1002/iroh.70023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.70023		OCT 2025											WOS:001592286100001

Existing methods often struggle to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability across diverse lake systems, with traditional models often requiring site-specific calibration and advanced machine learning techniques being computationally demanding and sensitive to time series structural components. This study proposes a novel framework integrating grid search-optimized Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (GS-SARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) models, optimized using the Augmented Weighted Mean Vector Optimizer (AWMVO). The optimization process is enhanced with composite cost functions and data-driven feature engineering. The framework's novelty lies in combining optimization with statistical insights from lake-specific datasets, enhancing model robustness and adaptability. The models' performances are evaluated by several metrics, e.g., the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The GS-SARIMA model achieved the highest test KGE (mean: 0.965; range: 0.946-0.989) and a consistently low MAPE (mean: 0.039%), excelling in capturing seasonal and nonseasonal patterns, but restricted by site-specific sensitivity. AWMVO-LSTM demonstrated superior generalizability across lakes, maintaining comparable accuracy with ability transfer, with a mean test KGE of 0.933 (range: 0.890-0.960) and mean MAPE of 0.046%, but it is the most computationally expensive model. XGB, while computationally efficient, showed the lowest average test KGE (0.838) and highest MAPE (mean: 0.073%, max: 0.176%), particularly underperforming in high variability systems, such as Lake Ontario. These results highlight essential trade-offs among computational efficiency, accuracy, and generalizability. This study emphasizes the value of optimizing predictive models with advanced techniques customized to hydrological and statistical characteristics. Future work should prioritize hybrid modeling and the integration of advanced feature engineering to address region-specific challenges, ensuring robust and transferable predictions for diverse hydrological systems.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT 14	2025	156	11							579	10.1007/s00704-025-05819-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-025-05819-y													WOS:001594667200005

The total OCP concentrations (& sum;OCPs) ranged from 231.72 to 1324.57 ng/g, while & sum;PAHs ranged from 15.17 to 30.92 ng/g. Drins were the most prevalent pesticides detected across all sample stations. All low molecular weight (LMW) PAHs were below the detection limits, except for acenaphthylene. Urban runoff and nearby industrial and domestic discharges could be responsible for the high levels of OCPs and PAHs at station L_P2. Isomeric ratio analysis of DDT compounds indicated no recent inputs of technical DDT, whereas hexachlorocyclohexane (HCHs) suggested a lindane source. Diagnostic PAH ratios suggested mixed sources of pollution, which were pyrolytic and petrogenic. Principal component analysis of the OCPs and PAHs dataset extracted three principal factors, each representing distinct pollutant origins within the creek sediments. The sources of OCPs were mainly agricultural and industrial run-off, whereas PAHs were primarily attributed to industrial emissions, biomass and wood burning, and vehicular combustion. Ecological risk assessment indicated that adverse effects from p,p '-DDT would rarely occur, whereas those from p,p '-DDD would occur regularly in benthic organisms in Apapa-Badagry Creek.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT 13	2025	197	11							1199	10.1007/s10661-025-14646-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-14646-7								41077593					WOS:001591039600001

This study investigates the spatiotemporal changes in water features and quality of three key drinking water source lakes-Rawal, Simly, and Khanpur (RSK), located in and around Islamabad, Pakistan. Using Level 2 Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite data from 1991 to 2020, changes in lake surface area were assessed through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Thresholding and geospatial analysis in ArcGIS 10.8 were used to extract and visualize water bodies and surface feature changes. The study found that lake surface areas were directly linked to rainfall levels and decreased with rising temperatures especially during 1991, 2000 2010, and 2020. Water quality was assessed using standard laboratory procedures. Notably, higher bacterial counts were recorded during the wet season, indicating increased microbial contamination likely due to surface runoff. Among the heavy metals analyzed (Fe, F, As, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cr, Pb, Ni, B, Cd, P, Hg), only boron (B), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr) were detected above background levels, though within permissible limits. The study highlights the significant influence of climatic variables on both the physical extent and microbial quality of drinking water lakes. These findings offer critical insights for policymakers and water resource managers, providing a replicable framework for monitoring and managing similar reservoirs in other climate-sensitive regions. Plain Language Summary This study explores how climate change, urbanization, and population growth have impacted the size and quality of three key drinking water lakes like Rawal, Simly, and Khanpur located in and around the Islamabad region of Pakistan. Landsat satellite data from 1991 to 2020 and geospatial tools like Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS, and standard methods for water quality were used for the assessment. The study found that lake surface areas were directly linked to rainfall levels and decreased with rising temperatures during 1991, 2000 2010, 2020 and fluctuations in other years. Water quality testing showed higher bacterial contamination during the wet season, likely due to runoff, while most heavy metals remained within safe limits. The research highlights the strong influence of climate on water quantity and quality and provides a model for monitoring lakes in other climate-sensitive areas.																			2471-1403					OCT 13	2025	9	10							e2025GH001595	10.1029/2025GH001595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025GH001595								41089435					WOS:001593492500001

Bosten Lake, the largest inland freshwater lake in China, represents a typical lake in an arid zone. To provide a theoretical basis for MPs pollution control in such regions, this study systematically investigated the characteristics, distribution, and ecological risks of MPs in Bosten Lake. Results show that MPs were widely present in the lake, with abundances in surface water ranging from 1.33 to 9.43 n/L (mean: 4.8 +/- 1.78 n/L) and in sediments ranging from 151.55 to 953.31 n/kg dry weight (dw) (mean: 479.11 +/- 210.22 n/kg), suggesting the presence of certain levels of pollution when compared to domestic and international studies. White (54.09 +/- 5.14%) and black (30.07 +/- 4.28%) MPs dominated, with fibers and fragments comprising over 70% of the forms. Polypropylene particles (0.1-0.5 mm) were the predominant type. Potential sources include residential activities, tourism, agriculture, and fisheries. Seasonal variations were observed in ecological risk, with the potential ecological risk index indicating an overall high-risk level. These findings highlight the need for dynamic management strategies for Bosten Lake and provide a scientific basis for monitoring MPs and assessing their ecological impacts in arid lake environments.

J	Antonowicz, J; Rybak, M; Wróblewski, T				Antonowicz, Jozef; Rybak, Michal; Wroblewski, Tomasz			A Relationship Between Nutrients in a Mid-Forest Eutrophic Lake	WATER												In 2023, studies were carried out on the aquatic environment of the forest lake & Lstrok;& eogon;towskie. The studies covered the horizontal and vertical planes and seasonal dynamics. Lake & Lstrok;& eogon;towskie is a lake with an area of 402 ha, which distinguishes it from other lakes in Pomerania due to its large area. In three quarters of the lake shore border forests, changes in surface and volume have been observed in the lakes over the last century, which has affected the chemistry of the water. The aims of this study were to determine the dependencies between the concentration of biogenic substances in the near-bottom layer and subsurface water and analyze the dependencies between chemical parameters in the water of the mid-forest lake & Lstrok;& eogon;towskie. In the water samples obtained, including the surface layer (SW) and the near-bottom layer (NBL), the concentrations of N-NO3, N-NO2, N-NH4, N-tot, N-org, P-PO4, P-tot, P-org, and O2, electrolytic conductivity, pH, Ca, and Mg were determined. Statistical analyses were carried out, including tests and multidimensional PCA and cluster analysis. A significant effect of forests on the chemical composition of lake water was observed. The conducted studies of & Lstrok;& eogon;towskie Lake indicate that the NBL experiences seasonal dynamics, where phosphorus and nitrogen compounds are transformed, which causes trophic changes in the lake. Based on multidimensional cluster analysis, differences between the SW and the NBL were shown. In & Lstrok;& eogon;towskie Lake, the level of biogenic substances in the water is significantly influenced by processes occurring inside the lake as a result of the exchange of matter between the NBL and bottom sediments. This exchange in shallower areas of the lake is influenced by winds, especially in exposed locations: this was observed for P-tot, P-PO4, P-org, Ca, N-NO3 and N-NH4, N-tot, and N-org. The conducted studies are important for supporting the protection of the Landscape Area "& Lstrok;& eogon;towskie Lake and the vicinity of K & eogon;pice" to preserve the existing values of the natural environment and maintain the ecological balance of natural systems. Current scientific publications on the hydrochemical data of & Lstrok;& eogon;towskie Lake are currently lacking, and the available data needs to be updated.																				2073-4441				OCT 9	2025	17	19							2913	10.3390/w17192913	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17192913													WOS:001593424200001

This study assesses 38 years (1984-2021) of surface water dynamics across 49 districts using high-resolution satellite data to identify hydrological disparities and inform district-level planning. The research addresses a significant gap in quantifying long-term changes in both seasonal and permanent surface water availability, normalized by population to estimate per capita access. We used the JRC Global Surface Water Mapping Layer derived from Landsat imagery to extract indicators such as water occurrence, absolute change, per capita seasonal and permanent water availability. A clustering approach using KMeans and Silhouette Score analysis was implemented to group hydrologically similar districts. In addition, we developed a surface water depletion index and increment index to identify districts with the greatest water loss and gain, respectively. A log-scaled seasonal-to-permanent per capita water ratio was used to assess hydrological imbalance. Results reveal stark spatial variation in surface water distribution. Chittorgarh and Tonk (Cluster 3) showed the highest availability indices (> 0.6), supported by perennial reservoirs and rainwater harvesting structures. In contrast, districts like Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh exhibited surface water depletion indices of 0.85 and 0.72. Conversely, Tonk and Jhalawar showed increment indices of 1.05 and 0.95, reflecting successful watershed interventions. Per capita permanent water availability ranged from < 50 m(2) in urban districts like Jaipur to > 1200 m(2) in low-density districts such as Jaisalmer. This district-level analysis provides a first-of-its-kind water vulnerability mapping for Rajasthan, enabling cluster-specific planning and targeted policy interventions. The findings support national initiatives such as Jal Shakti Abhiyan and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).<br /> [Graphics] .

The outburst-induced surface changes drive contrasting permafrost processes: desertification enhances permafrost development upstream, while wetting accelerates degradation downstream. This study provides critical insights for assessing environmental impacts and engineering safety in high-altitude permafrost regions under lake outburst events.Abstract The outburst of Zonag Lake in the permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has significantly altered the local environment, particularly affecting surface conditions and permafrost dynamics. By employing remote sensing and GIS tools, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in surface environmental changes (surface temperature, vegetation, and dryness) within the Zonag-Salt Lake basin. The results indicate that the outburst caused higher surface temperatures and reduced vegetation cover around Zonag Lake. Analysis using the Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) reveals higher dryness levels in downstream areas, especially from Kusai Lake to Salt Lake, compared to the upstream Zonag Lake. Temporal trends from 2000 to 2023 show a decrease in average Land Surface Temperature (LST) and an increase in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Geographical centroid shifts in environmental indices demonstrate migration patterns influenced by seasonal climate changes and the outburst event. Desertification around Zonag Lake accelerates permafrost development, while the wetting environment around Salt Lake promotes permafrost degradation. The Zonag Lake region is also an ecologically significant area, serving as a key calving ground for the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii), a nationally protected species. Thus, the environmental changes revealed in this study carry important implications for biodiversity conservation on the Tibetan Plateau. These findings highlight the profound impact of the Zonag Lake outburst on the surface environment and permafrost dynamics in the region, providing critical insights for understanding environmental responses to lake outbursts in high-altitude regions.																				2072-4292				OCT 9	2025	17	19							3392	10.3390/rs17193392	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17193392													WOS:001593921400001
J	Rahman, M; Vermaire, JC; Sivarajah, B				Rahman, Mubashshera; Vermaire, Jesse C.; Sivarajah, Branaavan			Assessing shifts in diatom communities in eastern Ontario recreational lakes in relation to land-use and climatic changes over the past ∼ 150 years using a top-bottom paleolimnological approach	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Eastern Ontario, Canada, is a lake-rich, rural region, located over the Precambrian Shield or Paleozoic dolomite and limestone bedrock. These lakes are typically nutrient-limited with total phosphorus (TP) less than 20 mu g L-1, and serve as the primary tourist attraction, contributing substantially to the local economy of this region. However, in recent years, residents have become concerned about the perceived increase in nuisance algal blooms. A spatial analysis was conducted to determine if present-day TP concentrations were influenced by modern land-use patterns and this analysis showed that percentage of croplands and wetlands in nearshore riparian buffer zones (300 m) was positively correlated with present-day TP concentrations of the lakes. Due to the lack of long-term water quality monitoring data little information exists on pre-impact conditions and water quality trends in these lakes. To address this gap, a top-bottom paleolimnological approach was used to examine diatom community shifts in thirty-five oligo-mesotrophic lakes (TP 5 -19 mu g L-1) located within the Mississippi River and Rideau River watersheds in eastern Ontario. Generally, the relative abundance of benthic taxa (e.g. Staurosirella pinnata, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata, Staurosira construens, Gogorevia exilis) has decreased, while planktonic taxa (e.g. Pantocsekiella comensis, Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria crotonensis) has increased. Tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira ambigua has decreased in relative abundance at oligotrophic lakes (TP 5 - 10 mu g L-1) while it has increased in mesotrophic lakes (TP 11 - 19 mu g L-1). The diatom-inferred TP (DI-TP) has decreased across most study lakes. The diatom assemblage changes across the 35 lakes suggest that climate-mediated changes to lake-thermal properties (e.g. long ice-free season, longer and stronger thermal stratification) are influencing the recent assemblage composition. At the landscape level, climate-mediated changes are structuring assemblage composition in most study lakes where nutrient levels have been decreasing. However, in some mesotrophic lakes, local land-use changes and an increase in TP concentrations may be influencing recent algal assemblages.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				2025 OCT 8	2025										10.1007/s10933-025-00376-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-025-00376-w		OCT 2025											WOS:001589146700001

Here, we propose a three-tiered attribution framework to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns, underlying drivers, and upstream-downstream relationships of runoff variations in the Yellow River Basin (1952-2021). The results indicate that the longitudinal cumulative effects of climatic (ranging from -8.6% upstream to 7.1% downstream relative to the whole basin) and anthropogenic disturbance (15.2%-92.9%) factors lead to higher risks of runoff variations in downstream regions, with more pronounced seasonal fluctuations (particularly in reservoir-regulated reaches). Glaciers, lakes, and reservoirs' storage capacities cause lagged effects of climate change and human activities on runoff variations, while simultaneously serving as critical drivers for inter-basin water resource regulation. Integrating comprehensive understanding of multi-scale hydrological variability drivers and spatial interaction mechanisms is essential for advancing adaptive river basin management and sustainable water resources allocation.																				2662-4435				OCT 7	2025	6	1							794	10.1038/s43247-025-02759-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-025-02759-3													WOS:001588892300002

Total Column GHG Ratios From Ground-Based Measurements Inform Emissions Inventories	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Accurately characterizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential for improving inventories and evaluating mitigation efforts. However, this remains particularly challenging in urban environments with heterogeneous emissions and complex meteorological conditions. One effective approach which addresses these challenges uses trace gas ratios of atmospheric measurements to evaluate emissions. This study leverages total column concentration (X-gas) measurements from a single EM27/SUN spectrometer in Utah's Salt Lake Valley (SLV) to analyze X-CH4 : XCO2 and XCO : XCO2 ratios across multiple spatiotemporal scales. By applying a rolling ratio method on sub-day time windows, we identify periods of strongly covarying concentration enhancements throughout the multi-year data set. This method reveals seasonal trends that are obscured using approaches from previous literature. We also examine how ratio variations correspond to changing wind conditions, facilitating more granular spatial emissions attribution. Comparisons with CO and CO2 from the publicly available GRA2PES inventory reveal that the CO:CO2 inventory ratios align well with observations, supporting the inventory's methodology. In contrast, comparisons with the GRA2PES CH(4 )inventory beta, which is still under development, indicate that it does not adequately capture the spatial distribution of CH4 sources in the SLV, highlighting areas for improvement. These findings demonstrate that a single sun-tracking spectrometer can provide valuable emissions insights and inventory constraints, without requiring multiple instruments or computationally intensive inversion models.					; McDonald, Brian/B-5897-2015	Meyer, Aaron/0000-0001-7388-1345; MCDONALD, BRIAN/0000-0001-8600-5096; Lin, John/0000-0003-2794-184X													2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 6	2025	130	19							e2025JD044398	10.1029/2025JD044398	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025JD044398													WOS:001588484700001

This study was conducted on D & lstrok;ugie Lake (26.8 ha, 17.3 m, Masurian Lake District, northeastern Poland), which was completely degraded by raw wastewater inflow. After the long-term restoration (1987-2003) and recovery of submerged macrophyte meadows, the invasion of Elodea nuttallii-an invasive alien aquatic plant (IAAP)-was observed due to the increasing water temperature in recent years, impairing the functioning, biodiversity, and ecosystem services of this urban lake, as well as causing the deterioration of lake water quality. Therefore, an excessive biomass of E. nuttallii has been removed from the lake since 2022. The analysis of physico-chemical water quality parameters showed that consecutive excessive biomass macrophyte gradual removal (three times during the growing season) helps to limit the excessive growth of E. nuttallii and also removes nutrient loads from the ecosystem. Removing excess aquatic vegetation also helps maintain the lake's aesthetic and recreational value. Currently, the total phosphorus concentration in lake water did not exceed 0.3 mg P/L and total nitrogen did not exceed 2.0 mg N/L.

Decision - support framework for translating strategic vulnerability assessment of freshwater wetlands: From theoretical concept to operational application	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Wetlands are dynamic ecosystems shaped by hydrology, climate, soil, and biogeochemical processes, supporting diverse and specialized biodiversity. However, they are highly vulnerable to climate change and human-induced stressors such as landuse change, pollution, and sedimentation, which threaten their stability and resilience. Given these challenges, there is an urgent need for translational research that connects scientific understanding with practical decision-making to guide effective wetland management and policy responses. To bridge the gap between scientific understanding and policy implementation, this study introduces the Wetland - Vulnerability Assessment Conceptual Model using Indicators selected by the System's Thinking Approach (WET-VISTA) framework, grounded in the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response) approach and IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) guidelines considering Loktak lake as a case study. The framework employs a three-phase methodology: (1) translating theoretical concepts into a structured knowledge base, (2) collecting and integrating qualitative and quantitative data including rainfall, land cover change and flood inundation on stressors and ecosystem responses towards framework development and 3) development of a novel framework to translate theoretical concept into decision-support tools and to derive recommendations for sustainable management of wetland ecosystems. The study shows that the inappropriate Ithai barrage operation and erratic precipitation has caused the Phumdi proliferation to raise up to 239.56 sq.km (80.8%) during 2019 monsoon season. Flood assessment results shows that croplands are more vulnerable to the floods compared to the built-up lands. The highest percentage of submergence has been occurred in Heirok- Sekmai sub-basin during 2020 monsoon season, submerging more than 16% of the crop lands.					jayanarayanan, brema/ADV-6373-2022	jayanarayanan, brema/0000-0002-5352-1112													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2025	179								114274	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114274		OCT 2025											WOS:001591490700001

The unique features of WUI may influence the atmospheric flows in the vicinity of fire. This study utilizes the parallelized large eddy simulation model (PALM) system for fire-atmosphere simulations of Bottle Lake Forest, Christchurch, New Zealand. Over 3,000 residential buildings are situated around the 7 forest, with many homes only 50 m away from the forest edge. We conducted high-fidelity fire-atmosphere simulations with the finest grid spacing of 4 m. Wildland forest (WF) and flat terrain simulations were conducted to provide a reference for comparison with WUI simulations. Fire-weather conditions for the 2022/2023 New Zealand fire season were selected based on the Fire Weather Index (FWI). Data from previous fire field campaigns were obtained to represent a low-intensity fire heat forcing. The results reveal a pulsing behavior in downwind heat transport when the forest canopy is included. Furthermore, the presence of the WUI is associated with extended downwind fire heat transport compared to WF and flat terrain scenarios. This study is the first to simulate atmospheric flows near fires in a WUI setting with such high fidelity. The findings highlight the critical role of WUI features in shaping fire-atmosphere dynamics, though further research is required to disentangle the contributions of individual WUI components to these effects.

While honey production occurs across various regions, the southern zone, particularly near native rainforests, yields highly valued honeys that often lack comprehensive analytical characterization. This study was focused on seven apiaries near Lake Ranco in the Los Rios Region, collecting two honey samples from each location over two consecutive harvesting seasons, totaling 20 samples. Key parameters analyzed included botanical origin, total carbohydrates, glucose/fructose ratio, total phenolic compounds, antioxidant/antiradical activity and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content. The results indicated a significant influence of three native species, Eucryphia cordifolia, Caldcluvia paniculata, and Weinmannia trichosperma, on the antioxidant activity of the honeys. The physicochemical parameters measured, along with the concentration and activity of the compounds responsible for this activity, establish a very characteristic pattern for the monofloral honeys of these three species. This information could serve as a foundation for constructing a map to help differentiate Chilean honeys based on their natural biological attributes helpful for consumer health, generating distinctive profiles that would contribute to accurately guaranteeing their geographical origin and, consequently, increase their specific value.																				1420-3049				OCT 4	2025	30	19							3984	10.3390/molecules30193984	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules30193984								41097403					WOS:001593758400001
J	Li, C; Wu, W; Chen, H; Ren, L; Kang, X				Li, Chen; Wu, Wei; Chen, Hang; Ren, Lei; Kang, Xiao			Freeze-thaw seasonal variations and environmental controls of CO2 and CH4 diffusive emissions from reservoirs in the upper Yellow River	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Reservoirs are significant sources of atmospheric carbon greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide [CO2] and methane [CH4]) emissions. This study analysed the seasonal emission patterns of CO2 and CH4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes from water bodies, along with the associated environmental controls, in the three large reservoirs of the upper Yellow River on the Tibetan Plateau. The results indicated that the soil thawing period represented a critical window for carbon greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs (CO2: 239.3 +/- 94.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and CH4: 201.1 +/- 366.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Emissions of these gases from reservoirs were predominantly driven by photodegradation of organic carbon during the soil freezing period, whereas anaerobic respiration by microorganisms was the primary process during the soil thawing period, supplemented by photodegradation. CO2 emissions from reservoirs were driven primarily by natural environmental pressures, particularly the alpine climate and high altitude of the plateau region. Precipitation and altitude were the main factors influencing the carbon input from terrestrial sources, whereas dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a predominantly governed the metabolism of carbon from endogenous sources. CH4 emissions from reservoirs were influenced primarily by anthropogenic environmental pressures, including reservoir siltation and the confluence of tributaries characterized by high pollutant loads. Ammonia nitrogen served as a critical limiting factor for CH4 emissions, which, along with dissolved oxygen, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential, collectively affect CH4 releases. These findings enhance the understanding of the balance of greenhouse gas carbon emissions in reservoirs on the Tibetan Plateau and provide a scientific basis and theoretical support for greenhouse gas emission reduction in this region.																			2045-2322					OCT 3	2025	15	1							34528	10.1038/s41598-025-17745-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17745-0								41044266					WOS:001587515500010

However, developing a generalizable framework to quantify these complex supply-demand dynamics presents methodological challenges that currently constrain effective water quality management. In the study, we developed a novel framework that quantifies the dynamic WPS supply-demand relationship. By coupling long-term water quality monitoring data with hydrological modeling and random forest algorithms, the framework quantifies the WPS supply capacities of each upstream subbasin and the WPS demand of lakes and reservoirs. We applied this new framework to a critical drinking water source watershed in eastern China. Results showed that (1) Upstream ecosystems retained substantial total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for the downstream reservoir, intercepting an average of 6.80 x 106 kg TN and 2.57 x 106 kg TP annually, and the supply varied among years, seasons, and subbasins. (2) On the demand side, 14.7 % and 32.4 % reductions in TN and TP loads of the downstream reservoir were required. (3) Temporal mismatches between supply and demand were revealed, with 65 % of TN mismatches concentrated in March-May, and 71 % of TP mismatches occurring in July, March, and June. We recommend spatially targeted conservation measures and temporally adaptive management strategies for optimizing WPS supply-demand balance. Our framework provides an effective method for giving information to targeted watershed management by resolving spatiotemporal disparities of WPS supply and demand.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JAN 1	2026	288		B						124657	10.1016/j.watres.2025.124657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.124657		OCT 2025						41045886					WOS:001588981000001

Based on monthly monitoring data from five fixed stations in Baihua Reservoir between January 2021 and December 2022, this study evaluated the seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll a (Chl.a) and its nonlinear responses to environmental drivers. We first applied Spearman rank correlation combined with variance-inflation-factor screening (VIF < 5) to remove highly collinear predictors, then used Random Forest analysis to rank the remaining variables, identifying water temperature (WT), pH and total phosphorus (TP) as the primary drivers of Chl.a. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) explained 56% of the variance in Chl.a, showing that Chl.a increased monotonically with WT between 10 and 18 degrees C, rose almost linearly with pH from 7.8 to 8.4, and exhibited a threshold response as TP approached 0.04 mg L-1. This study provides a fresh approach to assess the key factors influencing Chl.a and their interactions in Baihua Reservoir.

This study aimed to assess the physicochemical characteristics and microbial community structure of the sediments from "La Encantada" over a six-year period (2017-2024), during dry and rainy seasons. We collected sediment samples from three sites, measuring in situ parameters like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductivity. Additionally, we analyzed heavy metal concentrations (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Pb, Cd) using ICP-OES. DNA was extracted from the sediments for metagenomic analysis, and microbial communities were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results showed significant temporal variation in temperature and pH, with a decrease in heavy metal concentrations over time, suggesting a possible improvement in water quality. Microbial diversity was highest during the low water season of 2024, with shifts in dominant bacterial phyla, particularly a decrease in Proteobacteria and Planctomycetota, and an increase in taxa like Microbacterium and Bacillus. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis revealed changes in microbial metabolic activity, such as degradation of xenobiotic compounds and methanogenesis, including a decrease in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in 2024, possibly linked to environmental changes. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of the lake ecosystem and the influence of environmental factors on microbial communities.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT 2	2025	236	13							837	10.1007/s11270-025-08487-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-025-08487-w													WOS:001586966100018

Giant otter populations persist and demonstrate recovery potential in suboptimal freshwater ecosystems degraded by gold mining	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, land conversion is driving the depletion of biodiversity. Freshwater systems are especially vulnerable due to their accessibility and sensitivity to human pressures. Freshwater megafauna, which depend on suitable environmental conditions and stable prey resources, can serve as indicators of ecosystem health. We carried out visual surveys in four neotropical protected areas and the Madre de Dios gold mining corridor to examine how human pressures, particularly artisanal gold mining, influence the distribution and space use of giant otter populations. In unprotected lakes, extractive activities negatively impacted giant otter occurrence and group size, primarily through reduced water quality. Otter distribution and abundance were positively associated with water quality parameters, specifically transparency and dissolved oxygen. Protected areas maintained more stable otter populations, and otter occurrence showed seasonal variation, increasing during dry seasons. Within unprotected lakes, otters showed a tendency to occur in areas near sites with recent evidence of mining, a finding that suggests potential behavioral tolerance to lower-intensity disturbances and ability to recolonize disturbed freshwater habitats, rather than the predicted avoidance of such areas. However, this interpretation requires further investigation into long-term demographic impacts and the influence of unmeasured cumulative human pressures. Our multi-scale dataset provides unique evidence on the impacts of extractive activities on giant otter populations, underlining the need for multi-pronged conservation strategies. Our findings also emphasize the importance of protected areas in preserving neotropical freshwater biodiversity while highlighting the need to extend conservation efforts beyond current boundaries. Further research is needed on the impacts of extractive activities on otter demography and, critically, to test the hypothesis regarding the potential role of abandoned mining ponds as novel habitats for restoration of megafauna species and freshwater communities.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2025	179								114265	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114265		OCT 2025											WOS:001588906700001

Testicular tissue collected from this site in 2003 exhibited numerous large, pigmented macrophage aggregates (MAs) and a novel, previously undescribed hypertrophy and proliferation of putative Sertoli cells. In testes samples collected in 2007, numerous testicular MA, testicular oocytes, and proliferations of Sertoli cells were observed. Three carp collected in 2007 also had raised nodules within the testes, and, microscopically, seminoma, spermatogenic seminoma, and mixed stromal cell-germ cell neoplasms were diagnosed. Several risk factors for these adverse effects were identified. Carp collected at this site in 2003 ranged in age from 35 to 54 years and had the oldest mean age of the thirteen sites sampled within the Colorado River basin. This site also has an unusual thermal regime when compared to other sites studied in Lake Mead and upstream sites, in that temperatures varied little over the seasons (amplitude around 1.5 degrees C) and barely reached 15 degrees C. Additionally, carp from this site had the highest total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) body burden. Hence, advanced age, low water temperature, and exposure to PCBs and other environmental contaminants may contribute to the observed abnormalities, highlighting the complex environmental factors initiating pre-neoplastic and neoplastic changes in wild carp.																			2076-2615					OCT 2	2025	15	19							2887	10.3390/ani15192887	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani15192887								41096482					WOS:001593403600001
J	Masuku, NB; Curtis, CJ; Griffin, NJ				Masuku, Nkosazane Bha; Curtis, Christopher James; Griffin, Neil James			Identifying Environmental Factors Influencing the Concentration, Fluxes and Spatial Distribution of Microplastic Pollution in an Urban River: A Case Study of the Klip River, South Africa	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Urban freshwater systems are increasingly recognised as critical conduits for microplastic pollution, however, the interactions between land use, hydrology and microplastic transport remain poorly understood, particularly in developing countries. To address this gap, we investigated the relationships between catchment characteristics and the temporal and spatial variations in microplastic concentrations and fluxes in an urban river in South Africa. A microscopy approach was used to enumerate microplastic particles in 12 monthly surface water samples from six locations during November 2020 - October 2021. Microplastic particles dominated by fibres were observed in all selected sampling sites with monthly mean concentrations ranging from 0.18 to 2.90 particles L-1. Land cover has a significant impact on microplastic inputs; compared to formal residential areas, informal settlements showed increased concentrations. Microplastic fluxes accumulated moving downstream through the catchment. Microplastic flux calculated using modelled runoff was lowest upstream at site 1 (9.69 x 108 MP/y) and peaked at the furthest downstream site 6 (4.41 x 1010 MP/y). However, measured flow data from Site 6 indicate that actual flows, including return flows from densely populated urban water systems, are almost ten times greater than runoff modelled from precipitation data. Hence the actual flux at site 6 is 4.34 x 1011 MP/year. Rainfall patterns had a significant role in shaping monthly variations in microplastic concentrations and fluxes. Although wetlands were expected to retain microplastics, only one wetland-associated reach showed a decline in fluxes. Further characterisation of wetland types (e.g., channelled vs. unchannelled valley bottom) is required to improve understanding of their differential capacity for microplastic retention and to account for the observed spatial variation. The findings of this study show that seasonality, precipitation, land cover, runoff and wetland presence significantly influence the pervasiveness of microplastic pollution in urban river catchments. Furthermore, this study contributes to the limited freshwater microplastic literature in developing countries and provides insights to guide waste management, integrated natural resource management and wetland conservation strategies in similar contexts.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT 2	2025	236	13							861	10.1007/s11270-025-08515-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-025-08515-9													WOS:001586966100015

However, the extent to which the natural variability and dynamics of SPM and its associated microbial community influence estrogen degradation, particularly during seasonal cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs), remains poorly understood. Combining field investigations and laboratory bioassays, we examined how CyanoHABs-driven shifts in SPM physicochemical properties and the associated microbial communities regulate estrone biodegradation in Lake Taihu, a eutrophic freshwater lake in China. Results demonstrated that CyanoHABs significantly increased SPM concentrations (18.6-93.8 mg L-1), organic carbon content, and particle size compared to resuspended SPM in the pre-bloom season, while altering organic matter composition toward autochthonous protein-like substances. Concurrently, the attached microbial community assemblage shifted from deterministic selection to stochastic dominance, forming tightly interconnected microbial co-occurrence networks (average degree: 61.8) with diverse keystone taxa. The enriched labile organics (tyrosine-like substances) and the increased niche-specific degradation pathways associated with negative interspecies interactions enhanced the estrone biodegradation potential (EBP) of SPM from 153.98 to 466.70 ng mg-1. However, in post-bloom samples, resource homogenization resulted in decreased microbial diversity, niche breadth, and network stability, leading to a 53 % decline in EBP, despite comparable SPM organic carbon content. A PLS-PM model further revealed that organic carbon, proteinlike organic matter, and microbial network properties collectively explained 91 % of the variability in SPMnormalized EBP. Notably, pre-bloom samples having the most pronounced deterministic assembly processes demonstrated the highest organic carbon-normalized EBP, with its variability (32 %) explained solely by microbial network complexity. This study underscores the need to integrate SPM dynamics and microbial network stability into management strategies aimed at mitigating estrogen pollution in eutrophic lakes, particularly under escalating CyanoHABs regimes.

A total of 69 phytoplankton species were identified, marking the highest recorded taxonomic diversity in the region's reservoirs. Bacillariophyceae, represented by 30 species, exhibited the greatest diversity, a common feature of tropical reservoirs. The highest phytoplankton abundance occurred during the monsoon season, while the lowest was recorded in the post-monsoon. Ceratium hirundinella was the dominant species, comprising 59.88% of total phytoplankton abundance, indicating a mesotrophic state and an intermediate stage in the life cycle of reservoir. Spatially, the highest phytoplankton abundance was recorded at near the dam site, followed by mid-stream shallow region and the sites where human intervention was prevalent (tourist area and the cage culture site). The calculated value of diversity indices revealed moderate phytoplankton diversity in the reservoir, with Shannon-Wiener index (H') values ranging from 1.1 to 2.19, Margalef richness (d') from 3.06 to 4.76, and Evenness (j') from 0.303 to 0.593. Pearson's correlation showed positive relationships between total phytoplankton abundance and water quality variables such as temperature, alkalinity, PO4-P and NO2-N. Further, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identified water variables viz., electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, transparency, NO3-N and PO4-P as key abiotic factors affecting the phytoplankton community.																				3004-9261				OCT	2025	7	10							1193	10.1007/s42452-025-07130-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-025-07130-x													WOS:001594800500013

The Influence of Tributary Runoff Components on the Dynamics of the Khanka Lake Level	WATER RESOURCES												For twelve rivers in the Lake Khanka basin, river runoff components were simulated using the HBV model structure with groundwater delay. Statistical smoothing methods were used to eliminate the effect of wind-induced setup and setdown on the measured levels, and the lake level observation data were decomposed into the main trend, seasonal, and residual components. The modeling results showed that the specific time period during which the bulk of groundwater reaches the discharge area is 2-3 years. Comparison of the components obtained from STL decomposition of the lake levels after removing the surge component with the model runoff components showed that only the main trend is statistically related to the groundwater runoff of the largest rivers in the catchment area. The analysis of the obtained results suggested that the existence of sufficiently long periods of stable high lake levels occurs with a combination of an increased annual inflow and groundwater travel formed in the catchment area due to precipitation in previous years; accordingly, the decrease in the lake level occurs with a delay of 2-3 years after the onset of the low-water phase.

Utilization of a solar PV mini-grid powered cold storage to reduce fishery spoilage - A Tanzanian case	ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Access to electricity is important for the development of rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. One area where better electricity access could contribute to development is reduction of spoilage of food. This article aims to understand how access to electricity can affect the spoilage of fish and the economical possibility to implement a communal cold storage unit connected to a solar PV mini-grid, as well as what technical requirements this would put on the mini-grid operation. The study is based on a case on the island Ukara in Lake Victoria, Tanzania. A techno-economic analysis is performed simulating a walk-in cold storage room connected to a solar PV mini-grid. The article also includes a qualitative analysis with a causal loop diagram illustrating the interlinkages between the system variables to identify the effects of electrification on the spoilage of fish. The findings indicate that it is economically feasible to implement a communal cold storage unit if an investor makes the initial investment and allows the fishers a pay-back period of at least one year and if a profit wants to be made more than 50 kg fish should be sold a day. Another finding is that the capacity of the mini-grid may need to increase to be able to cover the demand during periods of low solar PV generation. The cost for the mini-grid company becomes higher with the cooling unit during the high season of fishery, this is since the rain seasons correlate with this, and the solar radiation is low. The mini-grid operation cost is around 2.4 $/day higher with the cooling unit connected to the grid, it may be higher if the mini-grid owners decide to run the diesel generator instead to invest in higher capacity batteries and solar PV. The causal loop diagram indicates that access to electricity can be an important solution to reduce the spoilage of fish by enabling the use of cold storage. Moreover, electricity access allows the fishermen to use electricity for value addition of the fish, as the refrigerated fish have higher price than fresh fish. The spoilage has become zero when the fish is refrigerated.

To date, the spatiotemporal variations in GHG emission across different types of coastal creeks and their environmental drivers remain poorly understood due to the lack of observational data. A field investigation was carried out to analyze the concentrations and fluxes of CO2 and CH4 across three coastal creeks (designated as CC1, CC2 and CC3) within the Shanyutan Wetland in southeastern China. These creeks received exogenous input from different sources. The results indicated that CO2 and CH4 concentrations in all three creeks remained persistently oversaturated, with concentrations in the range of 14.5-61.5 mu mol L- 1 and 1.1-11.8 mu mol L- 1, respectively. The estimated emission fluxes varied in the range of 0.4-3.6 mmol CO2 m- 2 h- 1 and 40.2-581.1 mu mol CH4 m- 2 h-1. The mean CO2 efflux over the four seasons was highest in CC1 (1.9 mmol m- 2 h-1) and lowest in CC2 (0.8 mmol m- 2 h-1). For CH4 efflux, the highest value was in CC2, followed by CC3 and CC1. PO4 3availability was the primary factor affecting the change of CO2 concentration and emission, while CH4 were primarily regulated by DOC, DO, TDN and abundances of mcrA and pmoA genes. These results highlighted that coastal creeks are significant atmospheric GHG sources and exogenous inputs substantially influenced their variabilities.

Spatio-Temporal Resolution of Microbial Functions and Taxa Associated With Cyanobacterial Harmful Algae Blooms Along a 500-Km Aquatic Continuum in the Lake Erie Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Biogeochemical processes rendered by the aquatic microbiome could influence the development of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs), but those biotic factors are poorly understood and rarely considered. We focused on the link between microbial functions, community composition and environmental gradients along the Thames River-Lake St. Clair-Detroit River-Lake Erie corridor across different seasons. We measured the abundance and expression (transcripts) of genes involved in nutrient cycling and microcystin toxin production with qPCR and determined microbial community composition with high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Throughout the year, genes and transcripts involved in P acquisition, denitrification and N fixation were in higher abundance upstream in the Thames River and Lake St. Clair. Gene abundance, rather than expression, correlated with environmental variables, but functional changes were linked to changes in the aquatic microbiome and did not respond directly to larger environmental gradients. Network analysis revealed tighter connections between gene expression and biotic variables than gene presence, with ubiquitous and streamlined-genomes microbes associated with the dominant bloom-causing cyanobacteria, highlighting the cooperative dynamic of these associations. Overall, the results highlight the link between the changing microbiome, microbial processes and the watershed influence in the presence of cHABs.

The research aims to understand the roles of elemental ratios (C: N, Fe: P, C:P) and different phosphorus pools (Labile P, apatite P, non-apatite inorganic P) in controlling phosphorus release and assessing environmental risks. A total of twenty - eight sediment samples were analyzed for major elements including Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, and P after aqua regia digestion. Different phosphorus pools were determined based on chemical extraction methods. Organic carbon and total Kjeldahl nitrogen were also analyzed to assess the overall nutrient composition and potential for contamination.The sediments were acidic (average pH = 6.27), with average metal contents of Fe2O3 (5.69%), Al2O3 (5.73%), MgO (1.86%), and CaO (0.29%). The average phosphorus pool rankings were apatite P (204 mg/kg), non-apatite inorganic P (66 mg/kg), and Labile P (2 mg/kg). The results from the elemental ratios suggest that P is more tightly bound to Fe-P complexes and minerals in the sediments of affected areas, whereas it is more associated with organic P forms in the sediments of conserved areas. Consequently, mineralization in the conserved area may occur more slowly, resulting in a slow release of P from sediments in that region. Nutrient indices showed moderate pollution for P and severe for N across seasons and areas. Risk assessment (RI), calculated from bioavailable P, indicated a significant increase in RI (from 0.12 to 1.33) in affected areas under worst-case scenarios, suggesting that these areas are more susceptible to environmental changes regarding P compared to conserve area, which leads to a greater impact on the RI. These findings imply that the conserved area may be more effective in regulating changes in P concentrations in response to external factors and suggest that it plays a crucial role in mitigating P fluctuations, thereby enhancing ecosystem stability and reducing the risk of nutrient-driven environmental degradation.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2025	84	20							571	10.1007/s12665-025-12562-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-025-12562-0													WOS:001591460400011

Reservoir fishery disruption following drought-mediated reoperation for environmental flows	ECOSPHERE												Environmental flow (e-flow) management is a growing driver of dam reoperation in which impounded water is allocated to rivers for ecosystem benefits. However, the effects of reoperation on reservoir ecosystems remain largely unstudied, despite their global importance in providing critical social-ecological services (e.g., fisheries, food and water security). This deficiency has limited our ability to conduct inclusive assessments of the multiuse tradeoffs associated with reoperation. Here, we compiled fisheries survey data spanning five decades to evaluate potential responses to the e-flow-driven reoperation of a large montane reservoir in the arid southwestern United States. Following reoperation, seasonal water release patterns were modified, and late-season reservoir drawdowns diminished by 74% (from 13.6 to 3.5 m on average). Reoperation coincided with the population expansion of an introduced apex predator, destabilization of a recreational fishery, and adaptation by fisheries managers to mitigate. The degree and timing of late-season water-level stabilization was sufficient to facilitate predator reproduction. An exponential growth modeling framework, grounded in principles of invasion ecology, demonstrated that a two-stage (vs. one-stage) population productivity process was required to explain patterns in survey data and to generate biologically relevant parameter estimates. This outcome indicated that predator population expansion was not strictly inherent. Processes (e.g., system productivity) other than changes to seasonal water-level fluctuations could not explain the expansion. Collectively, results lend evidence that reoperation was a plausible contributing factor to predator population expansion, which disrupted reservoir services. Importantly, however, e-flow operations were mediated by periodic drought. Late-season drawdowns were reduced during relatively wet years, partially reflecting modifications to seasonal releases to help facilitate e-flows, but also during drier years to mitigate storage loss. Thus, these processes were not independent and operated in tandem. More comprehensive understanding of the reciprocal effects of drought-mediated reoperation may improve our ability to manage impoundments to better meet multiple conservation and societal objectives while adapting to change across a broad spectrum of drivers and social-ecological contexts. Hydroclimate may ultimately be an overriding process regulating dam operations, reservoir water levels, and delivery of effective e-flows given expected increases in drought frequency and severity in arid and semi-arid regions.																			2150-8925					OCT	2025	16	10							e70412	10.1002/ecs2.70412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.70412													WOS:001588503700001

This study investigated Lake Morske<acute accent> oko (Vihorlat Mts., Eastern Slovakia), whose origin has been debated. Using a multiproxy approach that combines hydro-acoustic surveys, sedimentological analysis, biomarker-based organic geochemistry, and pollen analysis, we confirm that the lake formed when a landslide from the eastern slopes of Motrogon and Jedlinka hills dammed the Okna valley shortly before 2780 cal a BP, coinciding with a documented wet period across Europe. Our record reveals a remarkably stable lake system that evolved from being dominated by terrestrial organic input to enhanced in-lake production after 1850 cal a BP. Our quantitative temperature and humidity reconstructions, the first in the region, capture major climatic episodes, including the end of the "2.8 ka event", Roman Warm Period, and Mediaeval Climate Anomaly, during which there was likely increased lake water thermal stratification or reduced connectivity with the catchment. The Little Ice Age period is marked by temperature fluctuations corresponding to the Maunder and Dalton minima. Human influence becomes evident from 1100 and 700 cal a BP through increased Cerealia-type pollen and atmospheric lead deposition from regional mining activities. This study provides a continuous, well-dated Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental record spanning nearly 3000 years from this region of the Carpathians, bridging a crucial gap between western and eastern records while definitively confirming the lake's origin from a landslide.

Variation in source contributions and composition drives differences in nitrogen mineralization and ammonium immobilization, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study quantified gross nitrogen mineralization (GNM), gross ammonium immobilization (GAI), and net nitrogen mineralization (NNM) across Lake, Inlet, and Mudflat zones during the dry season. Strong spatial variation was observed: GNM ranged from 0.10 to 2.59 mg N kg-1 d-1, GAI from 0.08 to 2.19 mg N kg-1 d-1, and NNM from-0.11 to 1.28 mg N kg-1 d-1. GNM and GAI were highest in the Mudflats, whereas NNM peaked in the Inlet. A Bayesian isotope mixing model indicated that hydrilla-derived organic matter was the primary contributor to nitrogen mineralization in Mud-flats. Multiple regression and structural equation modeling identified distinct controls for each transformation rate: sediment temperature governed GNM under cold conditions, while DOM quality indicators (e.g., C3, C:N, a (254)) were strongly associated with all three rates. Notably, a multiple regression model including C3, TOC, and a(254) explained 93.3 % of the variance in GNM. These results highlight the central role of autochthonous macrophyte-derived organic matter in regulating sediment nitrogen cycling, offering insights into internal nutrient dynamics and guiding targeted lake management.

Slope mass movements and debris flow activity in the Geysernaya River valley (Kamchatka, Russia)	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A detailed analysis of remote sensing data (1964-2024) and field surveys were used to classify and trace the dynamics of exogenous slope processes in the Geysernaya River valley over 60 years. Repeated low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) surveys and comparison of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) revealed that landslides and/or rock/debris collapses deliver material into channels, where it is pulsationally transported by debris flows. The formation of large debris flows in the Geysernaya River valley is associated with the collapse of significant fragments of its left side and outburst of dammed lakes. Debris flows from the right side of the valley are associated with the release of cold groundwater, heavy precipitation, and periods of snowmelt, while on the left side they may have a non-seasonal character, as they are formed within the thermal fields under conditions of constant heating and gas-hydrothermal manifestations. The study of endogenous process manifestations (areas of thermal anomalies, current uplifts, faults, epicenters of local earthquakes) and areas of exogenous movements (landslides, debris flow (mudflow) basins, fluvial erosion and accumulation) in the valley allowed identify a zone of potential activation of slope and debris flow processes. The zone covers the left side of the Geysernaya River valley, its bottom, and the basin of the Lavoviy Creek. The action of these processes on the left side of the valley is attributed to a combination of endogenous factors, including the crushing of rocks, their transformation into clays due to gas-hydrothermal impact, as well as heating and increased wetting of the slopes. These findings are crucial for understanding the activity of slope and debris flow processes in geothermal regions. They provide valuable insights that can be applied to other volcanic and hydrothermally active regions, such as the Kuril Islands and other parts of the Pacific Ring of Fire.																			0169-555X	1872-695X				DEC 15	2025	491								110029	10.1016/j.geomorph.2025.110029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2025.110029		OCT 2025											WOS:001588327400001

As glaciers release substantial meltwater containing nitrogen and carbon into lakes, microbial communities and their GHGs emissions could also evolve accordingly. So far, studies on seasonal and diel GHGs emission characteristics and their driving mechanism at high-altitude (> 5000 m) glacier-fed lakes remains relatively constrained. This study has focused on the Lhasa Valley Glacier, a typical continental-type glacier on the Tibetan Plateau, to explore the GHGs characteristics in the three newly formed glacier-fed lakes during distinct periods of glacier melting (i.e., initial ablation, peak ablation and end of ablation stage). A combination of techniques including multi-point continuous sampling, physicochemical characteristic analysis, 16S rRNA sequencing, and machine learning models had been utilized. Our results indicated that the annual average CH4, N2O, and CO2 emission rates were 0.76 +/- 1.00, 0.02 +/- 0.08, and -5.19 +/- 50.16 mmol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>d(-1), respectively, demonstrating that glacier-fed lakes were significant CH4 and N2O source to the atmosphere. We found substantial seasonal variation of GHGs emissions from lakes, particularly for CH4, with the maximum fluxes 104 times as high as the minimum value. Diurnal monitoring showed that GHGs emission were primarily concentrated during the daytime. Based on the 16S RNA sequencing results, we also observed seasonal variation of the microbial communities and their roles in driving GHGs emissions. Using Partial Least Squares Path Modeling, we further quantified complex relations among GHGs emissions, microorganism communities, and environmental factors. We found that the impact of microorganisms on GHGs emission could be further regulated by environmental factors such as water temperature and NO3--N. The Tibetan Plateau plays a critical role in global climate system. This study characterizes the GHGs emissions in glacier-fed lakes that has been less considered. Characterizing the GHGs emissions from this region could provide insights into how emissions contribute to global warming and climate change.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				OCT 1	2025	285								124064	10.1016/j.watres.2025.124064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.124064								40561627					WOS:001521143900001

In this study, we conducted a field enclosure experiment combined with metagenomic sequencing using Potamogeton crispus, a cold-season submerged macrophyte, to investigate its effects on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics across the sediment-water interface. The restoration of P. crispus led to marked decreases in the concentrations and sediment-to-water fluxes of bioavailable nitrogen (NH4+, NO3-) and phosphorus (SRP, DGT-P). These reductions were accompanied by substantial shifts in microbial community structure and functional potential. Genes involved in nitrogen fixation and organic N metabolism were suppressed, while those related to nitrate reduction, nitrification, and nitrogen stress responses were enriched. Similarly, genes associated with phosphorus cycling exhibited increased diversity and abundance under restoration. Key microbial genes (e.g., gst, pqqB, ttdB) were strongly correlated with nutrient levels, indicating a potential role in nutrient stabilization. This study highlights the unique ecological function of cold-season macrophytes in regulating sediment biogeochemical processes and provides mechanistic insights into plant-microbe-nutrient interactions relevant to seasonally optimized lake management.

The results indicate that microplastic abundance in the living area of BYD was the highest during both wet and dry periods. with differing sources being the primary factors influencing the distribution of MPs. During the wet period, the vertical distribution of MPs was highest in the water layer (1900 f 824 n center dot m- 3), followed by the viscous sublayer (1625 f 362 n center dot kg- 1) and sediment layer (1375 f 249 n center dot kg- 1). Conversely, during the depleted period, the abundance distribution exhibited an opposite pattern, with significant changes in vertical distribution influenced by seasonal. Factors such as vertical flow velocities in the water column, shape, specific surface area, polymer type, and biological interactions significantly influence the vertical abundance of MPs, highlighting the critical role of the viscous sublayer at the sediment-water interface in this distribution. The ecological risk assessment model for MPs shows that BYD's risk index is low and unlikely to harm human health. This study elucidates the current distribution of MPs within the BYD ecosystem and provides a foundation for assessing potential pollution risks in the area.

Prominent channels and archipelagoes define a fragmented landscape where natural fire activity is rare owing to the hyperhumid, low-seasonality climate, considerable distance upwind from Andean eruptive centers, and sectors with negligible historical human disturbance. Here we examine the role of humans as past drivers of vegetation and fire-regime shifts with a fine-resolution, lake-sediment record from Lago Huill & iacute;n, located on southern Isla Grande de Chiloe<acute accent> (-43 degrees S). This is an isolated, strategic sector for modern and ancient navigation throughout the western Patagonian channels located just north of the core of the mid-latitude westerlies. We find a tight coupling between vegetation, fire activity, and westerly wind influence between -17.9 and 2.7 ka (ka: 1000 years before present) followed by unprecedented fire maxima between -2.7 and 0.3 ka, decoupled from a temperate-hyperhumid regime with uninterrupted dominance of temperate rainforests. This extraordinary condition occurred in the context of enhanced precipitation variability and widespread human occupation over the Patagonian channels in an otherwise fire-suppressed setting, establishing an unambiguous human footprint in a region classically regarded as pristine.

J	Nakayama, T				Nakayama, Tadanobu			Improvement to simulate plastic dynamics and their relation to biogeochemical cycles in global rivers by considering effect of interaction processes of biofouling and heteroaggregation	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Recent research pointed out that inland waters act as important transport pathway for both water and dissolved substances and play significant role in continental biogeochemical cycling. In the present study, advanced model coupling eco-hydrology with biogeochemical cycle (NICE-BGC) was extended to evaluate biogeochemical cycles and their relation to plastic dynamics in terrestrial-aquatic continuum on the global scale. The new model could show the effect of different grid resolutions to hydrologic and carbon cycles change. The model could also simulate different speciation states of micro-plastic to indicate the impact of interaction processes of heteroaggregation and biofouling on plastic dynamics. In particular, the model could estimate attached algal growth as the function of encounter kernel rate. The result showed that micro-plastic might quickly aggregate with suspended particle matter to form heteroaggregates in rivers with large amounts of micro-plastics, and this dominance of heteroaggregates is related to the higher concentration of both suspended particles and TOC (total organic carbon) there. Further, the dynamic rate for biofouling simulated by the model found that the algal growth affects diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of different speciation states of micro-plastic in some rivers, and the proportion of biofouled plastic increases in waters where the flow is slower and the retention time is longer. Finaly, plastic budget in global major rivers was estimated by including storages of reservoir, lake, riverbed, estuary, and interaction processes. These findings provide valuable insights for improvement of plastic cycle associated with carbon cycle variations to minimize the range of uncertainty in actual combined lotic and lentic waters.

For this purpose, the ULB was divided into six sub-basins. To calculate reference evapotranspiration (ETo), meteorological data and the FAO56 Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation were used, and ETa was calculated utilizing the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and 43 Landsat 8 and 9 satellite images. Furthermore, to calculate biomass, grain yield, and crop water productivity (WPc), the Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE) model was employed. In this study, 1115 irrigated wheat farms were monitored. The results indicated that the average ETo in the ULB during the irrigated wheat growing season is 802 mm. Also, Kcact differed from FAO coefficients (Kc) across growth stages, being higher during initial and final stages but lower during development and intermediate stages. According to the results, the average water consumption volume for the entire basin was determined to be 4566 m3/ha. Also, the overall average Harvest Index (HI) for the ULB was found to be 0.42. The results of the biomass and grain yield investigation revealed significant differences in their values among different sub-basins.

This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of REE concentrations in two major Mexican rivers-the Atoyac and the Alseseca-subjected to significant municipal and industrial discharges. Seasonal monitoring revealed higher FREE concentrations during the dry season (11.73 mu g L-1) compared to the rainy season (10.18 mu g L-1). This difference highlights seasonal changes' effects and underscores the influence of ambient geology and volcanic characteristics that could affect REE distribution. Geochemical signatures indicated distinct sources and controls on REEs behavior: Ce anomalies (avg. 0.32) were strongly linked to redox conditions, while Eu anomalies (avg. 9.12) reflected their provenance since the presence of plagioclase and alkali feldspar from igneous rocks weathering. During the dry season, positive Gd anomalies were observed (values from 0.87 to 1.26), as a tracer of anthropogenic contamination associated with intensive agriculture, industrial activity, and urban runoff, showing the seasonal impact. Acknowledging the significant effects of natural volcanic influences, this research identifies the central and often underestimated role of human activities in the accumulation of REE within fluvial systems. These findings advance our understanding of REE distribution and transport under varying seasonal conditions. This research contributes valuable baseline data for the region and provides important insights to expand the state of the art on REE mobility and fractionation in fluvial systems. The study enables the identification of key geochemical and anthropogenic processes that govern REE behavior in dynamic aquatic environments.

Nesting Biology of the Pacific Eider Somateria mollissima v-nigrum in Western Chukotka	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												-The first data on the breeding biology of the Pacific eider (Somateria mollissima v-nigrum) in Asia have been obtained using the example of the nesting population in the Apapelgin River (Western Chukotka). From 2018 to 2024, research was conducted to assess breeding density, phenology, and reproductive parameters of the eider. A total of 1291 nests of this species have been examined. This study presents data on the key parameters of the investigated breeding population: eiders predominantly nested in coastal lowlands rich in lakes, known as "laida." The average breeding density was 26.8 +/- 2.3 nests/km2, showing a declining trend over the years (R2 = 0.7). The average clutch size was 4.7 +/- 0.1 eggs. Clutch onset was influenced by the rate of snowmelt and the average temperatures during the last decade of May. The apparent nest success across all years was 33.4%, and the cumulative Mayfield nest success (MNS) estimate during the egg-laying and incubation periods was 0.37 +/- 0.14. The egg volume in clutches decreased over the study period and was influenced by weather conditions at the beginning of the breeding season, the date of egg laying, and clutch size. The data are analyzed in comparison with similar data on nesting populations from the continent of America.

We analyzed nearly four decades of Landsat 5, 8, 9 and a decade of Sentinel-2 vegetation index time series, calibrated with WorldView-2 imagery and validated against in situ littoral surveys to compare trampled and undisturbed plots. Trampled plots exhibited a persistent loss of vegetation index signal with no seasonal recovery, whereas undisturbed reference plots showed only minor fluctuations. Elevated visitor loads further depressed index values, accelerating a long-term downward trend in shoreline macrophyte density. Spatial change maps revealed that sandy shallows around beaches have experienced the most pronounced declines, and extending into intact littoral zones. Field observations confirmed fragmentation and decline of vegetation complexes, thinning helophyte communities, loss of floating-leaf patches, and near-absence of submerged stands in high-use swimming areas. Direct trampling and high visitor density have driven losses of shallow water macrophyte thickets, with implications for habitat quality and recreational value. These outcomes highlight the need for visitor-capacity guidelines to minimize impacts on the shoreline vegetation of vulnerable aquatic ecosystems.

Despite their importance in understanding glacier mass balance and regional climate change, a detailed description of SGLs and their intra-annual fluctuations across the entire GrIS remains understudied. Here, we present a deep learning-based approach to automatically map SGLs from passive optical satellite imagery across the entire GrIS during the melt seasons of 2017-2022. Approximately 150,000 Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images were utilized, each representing a 5-day average composite at a 10 km x 10 km grid resolution, with the Landsat images used as possible supplements. SGL predictions by the proposed method demonstrate high performance, achieving an F1-score of up to 0.959 compared to the independent test dataset. This high accuracy enables a detailed analysis of the key role SGLs play in enhancing surface ablation by absorbing solar radiation and delivering meltwater. The SGL-driven ablation effect was most pronounced in the South-West basin of the GrIS, where the peak lake area in July accounted for 44.9 % of the total GrIS-wide lake area. In contrast, the lowest magnitude (4.2 %) was observed in the South-East basin, despite similarly strong ablation in this region. Among all the generated SGL occurrence grids, peak SGL areas in certain grids (similar to 14 % of the total) were observed in May or September, rather than exclusively during the typical high-ablation months of June to August, reflecting regional and elevation-dependent variations. Grids further from the ice sheet margin generally showed peak SGL areas later in the melt season, which is evident in the western part of the GrIS. Monthly SGL peak areas shift dramatically from 253.18 +/- 123.94 km(2) to 5084.90 +/- 1043.26 km(2), with the lowest in May 2018 and the highest in August 2021. An extraordinary area spike occurred in September 2022 and was particularly monitored in the South-West basin, where abnormally intense rainfall and runoff simulated by the Mod & egrave;le Atmosph & eacute;rique R & eacute;gional (MAR) model were recorded. Our study highlights the significance of examining SGL area changes at short temporal intervals to understand the dynamics of cryospheric hydrology under future climate scenarios.

The availability of CO2 plays a critical role in shifting phytoplankton communities from diatom and green algae dominance to cyanobacterial dominance. The naturally high pH of surface water in karst regions, coupled with seasonal thermal stratification in reservoirs, leads to a more pronounced aqueous CO2 (CO2(aq)) deficiency in surface water of karst reservoirs. However, the impact of dynamic changes in inorganic carbon on phytoplankton communities in karst reservoirs remains unclear. Therefore, two typical sub-deep reservoirs in the karst region of southwestern China were selected in this study. Monthly surface water samples and seasonal vertical profile water samples were collected over a period of one year. The concentrations of nutrients, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and CO2(aq), as well as the stable isotope composition of DIC (delta C-13(DIC)) and phytoplankton species, were analyzed. The results showed that surface water CO2(aq) concentrations were considerably lower in the warm season compared to the cold season, and cyanobacterial abundance (r= -0.80, p < 0.01) showed a significant negative correlation with CO2(aq) concentration, while diatoms (r= -0.22, p > 0.05) and green algae (r= -0.06, p > 0.05) showed poor correlations with CO2(aq) concentration. This indicates that CO2(aq) deficiency conditions for phytoplankton growth favor the dominance of cyanobacteria. The CO2(aq) concentration in the bottom water was significantly higher than that in the surface water during the period of thermal stratification. This indicates that thermal stratification in reservoirs impedes vertical CO2 exchange, making surface water more susceptible to CO2 limitation and more conducive to cyanobacterial dominance. In addition, the nature of high pH of the karst reservoirs may exacerbate CO2(aq) deficiency in surface water, correspondingly enhancing cyanobacterial dominance. Furthermore, with global warming, the temperature rise and accompanying nutrient release from the sediment will increase the risk of cyanobacterial blooms in the reservoirs. This study highlights the high risk of cyanobacterial dominance in karst reservoirs in the context of global warming, and provides new insights into the ecological vulnerability of these reservoirs.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				OCT 1	2025	285								124060	10.1016/j.watres.2025.124060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.124060								40570500					WOS:001521960000003

Nevertheless, how OM molecular composition influence microbial community structure and subsequently regulate MNC accumulation remains incompletely elucidated. This study collected 0-30 cm surface soil samples from eight shoals across two typical habitats (reed and grass) within the seasonally flooded area of Dongting Lake wetland, to investigate the effects of OM molecular composition on microbial community and MNC accumulation. The results showed that MNC content in seasonally flooded wetlands ranged from 0.9 to 4.05 g kg(-1) , contributing 14.7-28.27 % to SOC, with fungal necromass carbon (FNC) as the major component of MNC. In both habitats, OM was primarily composed of labile components (Protein, Aliphatics, and N compounds). OM composition significantly influenced dominant fungal and bacterial taxa, with Gammaproteobacteria and Dothideomycetes selectively utilizing Aliphatics for growth. Although typically linked to recalcitrant OM degradation, Dothideomycetes adapted their substrate use in labile OM-rich environments. Notably, while labile OM components significantly affected microbial properties (community structure and biomass), these microbial properties were not the key drivers of MNC accumulation. Instead, FNC accumulation directly driven by increases in Protein and Aliphatics was the dominant factor in MNC accumulation in the seasonally flooded wetlands. Our findings highlight the critical role of labile OM components in the formation and turnover of MNC.

While extensive research has focused on surface water pollution, groundwater contamination by MPs remains critically understudied despite its growing environmental and public health concerns. This study investigates MP pollution in groundwater along Chennai's east coast, with a specific focus on pre- and post-flood variations following the 2023 flood event. Groundwater samples were collected from 49 locations along the Chennai coastline in November 2023 (pre-flood) and February 2024 (post-flood) and analyzed using a NIKON SMZ 745 binocular optic stereo microscope to assess MP physical characteristics, while ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was employed for polymer identification. To minimize confounding effects such as seasonal variation or ongoing pollution sources, sample collection was scheduled to reflect comparable hydrogeological conditions across both timeframes, with all sites located in consistent land-use zones. Comparative analysis revealed a 62% average increase in MP concentration post-flood, with some locations exhibiting an increase from 14 particles/L to over 37 particles/L, demonstrating the flood's pivotal role in MP mobilization and infiltration. Fibers were the dominant MP type (67%), followed by fragments (28%) and film-like MPs (5%), with nylon and polystyrene (PS) identified as predominant polymers. Spatial distribution analysis revealed hotspots in highly urbanized and industrially influenced areas, especially where sewage and stormwater channels intersected with shallow aquifers. These findings highlight the compounding effect of extreme hydrological events in accelerating MP transport into groundwater systems. Given the associated risks of MP ingestion such as oxidative stress, reproductive toxicity, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer this study underscores the need for targeted mitigation strategies. These include hydrogel-based filtration technologies, stricter plastic waste regulation, and adaptive policy frameworks to safeguard groundwater resources. The study fills a critical research gap by quantifying MP contamination dynamics and establishing the influence of disaster-driven recharge processes, offering a model applicable to flood-prone coastal regions globally.																			1400-0350	1874-7841				OCT	2025	29	5							53	10.1007/s11852-025-01134-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-025-01134-w													WOS:001592892900001

However, understanding of their functional roles and community assembly across varying environmental gradients in different lake ecosystems remains limited. In this study, we used 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and multivariate statistical analyses to investigate the spatiotemporal and biogeographical patterns of protistan and fungal communities in the water column of two different lake systems in Croatia. Our results revealed that these complex communities were dominated by Chlorophyta, Ciliophora and Cryptophyta as well as Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Chytridiomycota. Null model analysis showed that stochastic processes dominated most of the prokaryotic and fungal communities across sampled lakes and fractions, with seasonally salty Lake Crnisevo having more prominent variable selection due to the presence of a salinity gradient. Also, it was discovered that salinity had a negative influence on the stability of both protistan and fungal communities in Lake Crnisevo, acting as a major selective pressure. These results provide valuable insights into the community stability and assembly mechanisms of protistan and fungal communities in lake ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes.																			1758-2229					OCT	2025	17	5							e70209	10.1111/1758-2229.70209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.70209								41047612					WOS:001588470300001

Despite this, limited studies have focused on BPs in river sediments. In this study, we investigated ten BPs in different sediment types, including tidal flat and deepwater, across the Pearl River Basin. Sediment samples from the 0-15 cm depth at seven sites were also analyzed to investigate the vertical profile of BPs. In tidal flat sediments, no significant seasonal variation was observed in the total concentration of BPs (Sigma 10BPs), with values ranging from 20.8 to 148.1 ng/g in the dry season and 18.1-112.5 ng/g in the wet season. Spatially, the average concentration of BPs was lowest in estuarine sediments, while higher pollution levels were found in urban basin sediments. Deepwater sediments showed a higher BP concentration (average: 72.9 ng/g) compared to the corresponding tidal flat sediments (average: 65.5 ng/g), likely due to more favorable biodegradation conditions in tidal flat environments. The BP concentrations in sediment columns ranged from 12.2 to 93.8 ng/g. The vertical profile revealed that mid-layer sediments (5-10 cm) generally exhibited higher BP levels than those in the top (0-5 cm) and deeper (10-15 cm) layers. BPA showed significant positive correlations with total organic carbon (TOC) in tidal flat sediments. Environmental risk assessments based on the risk quotient (RQ) indicated that BP mixtures in Pearl River sediments posed low to medium risks to fish, algae, and crustaceans, with crustaceans being the most sensitive. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the occurrence of BPs in tidal and deepwater sediments of a river.					zehua, liu/C-5187-2009														0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 1	2025	382								126657	10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126657								40513796					WOS:001511788200002

Different water body types exhibit spatial and temporal differences after considering factors such as season and aquatic plant life forms. The results revealed that the annual global warming potential (GWP) (Tg CO2-eq yr-1) from swamps, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in China were 1382.42, 330.41, 266.86 and 150.98, respectively. The GWP from waters covered with emergent macrophytes was 2.02 times and 3.98 times that from submerged plants and floating-leaved (or floating) plants, respectively. Eutrophication significantly intensified the GHG emissions from inland waters. The combined effects of water body type, aquatic plant life form, and water temperature indicated that reservoirs have the highest GWP per unit area at water temperatures between 20 and 30 degrees C. Notably, the submerged plant zones in lakes have the lowest GWP (4.79 g CO2-eq m-2 yr-1), indicating that water ecological restoration projects focusing on submerged plant restoration will enhance carbon reduction from water bodies. The total annual GWP of inland waters GHG emissions in China ranged from 1806.43 to 2130.67 Tg CO2-eq yr-1. Projections under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios indicated that the GWP of inland water ecosystems in China will accelerate after 2030. This study enhances the assessment of the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle and provides a reference for inland water management to address global climate change.					zhu, jianglong/JZJ-5536-2024; wenxia, tan/GRO-6354-2022	Wang, Chuan/0000-0001-9597-2037; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT	2025	393								127130	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.127130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.127130								40913953					WOS:001568927800004

Despite the pronounced spatiotemporal variability observed in supraglacial ponds at annual and decadal scales, investigations of their seasonal changes are limited over large spatial scales. These investigations are critical for evaluating their impacts on glacier ablation and dynamics and predicting water resource availability. Here, we produced detailed seasonal maps of supraglacial ponds at five sites of the HKH for the years 2017 to 2022 using a deep-learning-based mapping method applied to PlanetScope imagery. Using these maps, we investigate pond seasonality and interannual variability. We found that (1) the average pond number and percentage ponded area over the debriscover area were higher in the Central Himalaya (417, 1.55%) and Eastern Himalaya (481, 1.93%) compared to those in the Hindu Kush (142, 0.20%) and Western Himalaya (153, 0.19%); (2) pond percentage area over debris-cover area showed an increase in the Karakoram (+0.2% in an absolute sense), Central Himalaya (+0.6%) between 2017 and 2020, and Eastern Himalaya (+0.9%) between 2018 to 2021; (3) supraglacial ponds reached their peak at the onset of the ablation season (May-June) in the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush, during the premonsoon season in the Western and Central Himalaya, and during the monsoon or post-monsoon period in the Eastern Himalaya; (4) the Central Himalaya displayed a highest occurrence of persistent ponds (17.2%), while only 4.3% of supraglacial ponds in the Karakoram were persistent. Our results provide a spatially diverse and temporally detailed dataset that serves to advance the understanding of supraglacial pond dynamics across the Hindu Kush-Himalaya.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. DOM-mediated nitrogen-phosphorus speciation dynamics were investigated in Baiyangdian Lake during the pre- and postflood periods. The key findings were: (1) Dominant nitrogen/phosphorus forms shifted to weak acidextractable nitrogen and calcium-bound phosphorus. Labile nitrogen and phosphorus contents decreased after flooding. Among them, the exchangeable nitrogen and strongly alkali-extractable nitrogen of LN decreased most significantly (64.64 % and 47.91 %, respectively). The most significant decrease in LP was observed for watersoluble phosphorus (71.79 %). Sediment nitrogen and phosphorus were closely related to nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll-a in the overlying water during the post-flood period. (2) DOM profiles transitioned from protein-dominated to humus-enriched components (42.09 % increase), exhibiting lower humification but enhanced autotrophic signatures post-flood. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy identified sequential DOM evolution: C1 (protein-like) -* C2 (humic-like) -* C3 (protein-like) -* C4 (humic-like). (3) Postflood Mantel and MIC analyses demonstrated intensified humus-nitrogen/phosphorus correlations. The structural equation model indicated that the synergistic effect between the humus components of DOM and environmental physicochemical parameters was enhanced under flood disturbances, jointly regulating the transformation and release of nitrogen and phosphorus forms. Humic components mediated 34-41 % of DOM's regulatory effects post-disturbance. Sediment TN bioavailability decreased by 38.75 % post-flood, but the overall ecological risk remained moderate to severe. The total phosphorus risk was consistently low. This study offers critical insights into targeted eutrophication control and carbon-nitrogen synergistic mitigation strategies.

J	Sodeman, AD; Brennand, TA				Sodeman, Alexander D.; Brennand, Tracy A.			Palimpsest subglacial meltwater corridors of the last cordilleran ice sheet: Geomorphology, stratigraphy and insights into subglacial meltwater dynamics during deglaciation	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Recent releases of high-resolution elevation data in British Columbia have revealed several previously unidentified meltwater-derived landforms associated with the last Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS). Prominent among these are small subglacial meltwater corridors (sSMCs): morphologically distinct channels up to 10s of km long that are eroded into glacial sediments, with varying intra-corridor landform assemblages. Intra-corridor landforms identified include curvilinear ridges, eskers and multi-ridged fans. The sSMCs are one or more orders of magnitude smaller than the previously described Chasm and Green Lake meltwater corridors, the latter two formed from an extremely large supraglacial lake outburst flood. Results from geomorphological, sedimentological and near-surface geophysical methods show that an erosional unconformity cut into the regional till sheet forms the base of each sSMC. This unconformity extends from the channel boundary and includes intra-corridor curvilinear ridges and erosional remnants, consistently topped by a 0.2-0.3 m thick concentration of cobbles. A discontinuous channel-wide fill (5-15 m thick) buries some curvilinear ridges and is sometimes capped by an intra-corridor esker. Multi-ridged fans occurring downflow from braided outwash plains postdate the sSMCs and all other intra-corridor landforms. We interpret the sSMCs as palimpsest landforms that developed over several melt seasons through the continuous reoccupation by subglacial meltwater flow (and later proglacial streams). Each trough found lateral to a curvilinear ridge represents an individual subglacial meltwater channel incised over one or more melt seasons.

In addition, based on the characteristic parameters of REEs, a combination of isotope tracing and Bayesian mixing models were applied to analyze the sources of REEs.ResultsThe concentrations of all REEs in the sediments were higher than the background values of local soil during both seasons, and the concentrations in normal season were higher than those in flood season. The geo-accumulation index indicated no obvious REEs pollution in the surface sediments. The pollution load index indicated slight REEs pollution in the surface sediments. However, the potential ecological risk indexes of the REEs were moderate, and the sum contribution rates of Lu, Tm, and Tb were more than 42%, indicating the ecological risk of these elements cannot be ignored. The Sr-Nd isotopes combined with Bayesian mixing models demonstrated that the REEs in the sediments mainly came from natural sources (47.78%, 29.84%), agricultural activities (39.83%, 56.60%), and industrial activities (12.39%, 13.57%) during normal and flood seasons respectively.ConclusionThe study area has a moderate potential ecological risk from the presence of REEs in surface sediments. The REEs in the surface sediments were mainly from natural sources, agricultural activities and industrial activities.

Such blooms decrease both water quality and the aesthetic value of nearshore areas, but identifying the mechanisms driving periphyton blooms in situ is complex. We conducted laboratory experiments using periphyton-covered rocks collected from the nearshore of oligotrophic Lake Tahoe, CA, to examine (a) baseline seasonal variability in periphyton biomass and metabolism, (b) effects of warming, nutrients, and their interaction on periphyton metabolism, and (c) seasonal variability in these effects on periphyton metabolism. We quantified rates of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem production (NEP) under 2 nutrient treatments (ambient and enriched) and 4 warming treatments (ambient, +3 degrees C, +6 degrees C, and +9 degrees C above ambient). Overall, warming stimulated GPP, NEP, and ER (Q10 temperature coefficients of 1.6, 1.4, and 2 respectively), with stronger effects during colder months. Warming also stimulated metabolic rates in the absence of nutrient additions. Short-term nutrient effects were more variable across seasons and alternated between depressing or stimulating metabolic rates (ranged from a 9%-11% decrease in rates to a 13%-27% increase across seasons). The relative importance of warming and nutrient effects were seasonally dependent as nutrients stimulated metabolic rates more than warming in October, and warming more so than nutrients in February and November. These results indicate that climate-driven alterations to temperature and nutrient regimes will have important and seasonally explicit consequences for the ecosystem energetics and periphyton community structure of oligotrophic lakes.

(Strigiformes, Aves) in the Clay Semi-Desert of the Trans-Volga Region	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Nesting features and the ecology of the eagle owl (Bubo bubo L.) in the northwestern part of the Trans-Volga clay semi-desert were studied in 1980-2024. Here, during the breeding season, the eagle owl is associated with local habitats of lake depressions and river valleys, and its nests are confined to steep slopes. Our main material was collected in a deep depression of the lake Elton (mainly on the territory of the Elton Nature Park), where 232 nesting cases were recorded in 1980-2024. 9 resident breeding sites have been identified there, where eagle owls have been nesting for many years in succession. With the development of farm cattle breeding, additional ones began to arise in the vicinity of some resident sites, forming a united nesting group with the resident. They were inhabited by couples disturbed in the residential areas, and, after their departure, young birds. All the nesting groups represented by resident and additional nesting sites were no longer functioning by the 2010s. When there were 5 to 9 breeding sites in the Elton region in 1980-2017 and 3 to 9 pairs nested annually, then only 2 breeding sites were noted in 2018-2023, almost all the nests of these pairs having been destroyed by cattle. The eagle owl population group, confined to the Elton Lake depression, is the core of the Elton-Khara population, since the conditions for eagle owl nesting are poor in the middle and upper reaches of the Khara River and the gullies flowing therein. For 45 years, an average of 5.2 pairs per year nested there and more than 19 birds (about 14 mature individuals) were present in the population annually. It is obvious that it is the Elton-Khara population that constantly "feeds" the eagle owl groups around the lakes Botkul, Bulukhta and Sorkul, which largely ensures the preservation of the species throughout the northwestern Trans-Volga region.																			1062-3590	1608-3059				SEP 26	2025	52	5							212	10.1134/S1062359025700323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359025700323													WOS:001582372700013

Resource quantity affects infection success and impacts of a microsporidian on hosts	OIKOS												Resource quantity in the environment often changes over time and influences the nutritional status of hosts that may encounter parasites. If resource availability significantly alters both infection success and within-host growth of a parasite, fluctuations in resources may underlie the seasonal disease outbreaks that have been observed for some parasites. Moreover, resource quantity may affect how a parasite impacts host survivorship and traits, including feeding rate and assimilation of nutrients. To determine how resource quantity affects infection success and parasite impacts on hosts, we conducted laboratory experiments using the microsporidian parasite Ordospora pajunii and its zooplankton host, the dominant grazer Daphnia dentifera. We found that infection probability and spore burden were higher when resources were more abundant, suggesting O. pajunii benefited when host quality was higher. However, parasite virulence, which was measured in terms of host mortality, was greater when resources were more limited. Although O. pajunii did not increase host mortality when resources were abundant, parasitic infection depressed host feeding rate at this resource level. Thus, sublethal impacts of O. pajunii on host traits, especially the feeding rate of a dominant grazer host, may have broader consequences within lake food webs. Despite changes in gut morphology of infected hosts, further investigation of host carbon assimilation efficiency and dissolved organic carbon release during infections when resources were more limited revealed no significant impact of infection. Overall, resource-dependent impacts of O. pajunii on hosts, including increased host mortality, may contribute to seasonal disease outbreaks and drive trophic cascades in lakes.

J	Lauchli, BM; Augustinus, PC; Hopkins, JL				Lauchli, Benjamin Michel; Augustinus, Paul Christian; Hopkins, Jenni Louise			New age model for Onepoto maar, Auckland, New Zealand, based on a revised tephrochronology of the lake sediment sequence	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Tephrochronology has proven to be a reliable dating tool in the context of northern New Zealand lakes due to the numerous volcanic centres on the North Island that have repeatedly erupted during the late Quaternary. The widely-distributed tephras often have distinctive geochemical compositions with many of these tephra layers preserved in the sediments that infill maar lakes in the Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF). Here, we present a revised age model for the Onepoto Maar lake sediment sequence, using 14 rhyolitic, seven basaltic, and two andesitic tephra layers with assigned ages as markers. These were integrated with bulk organic matter and pollen-derived radiocarbon ages to establish the new age-depth model. Improvement of the age model for the pre-45 ka section of the Onepoto record was based on the usage of tephras with refined ages: Eg2, Eg4, and Eg10 (Taranaki Maunga-sourced) and AVF D, AVF C, AVF B, and 90 AVF (AVF-sourced). The correlation of the Onepoto tephra horizons to the recently refined, multi-method derived, age model of the O<overline>ra<overline>kei maar tephra sequence has improved the robustness of the new Onepoto age model. Consequently, this approach has enabled development of reliable age assignations for tephra layers contained in the Onepoto sediments beyond the limit of 14C dating. Accurate chronologies for lake sediment sequences, such as the one presented here, are vital for paleoenvironmental research. Thus, the revised Onepoto age model improves upon previous models for our study site, offering more robust age control for regional paleoclimate studies covering the last two glacial cycles. It will also allow the extension of the existing high-resolution paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic records developed from the AVF maar lakes beyond MIS 5e to at least late MIS 7.																			1871-1014	1878-0350				JAN	2026	91								101706	10.1016/j.quageo.2025.101706	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quageo.2025.101706		SEP 2025											WOS:001584832100001

However, current LSWT measurements mainly rely on infrared thermometry and traditional in situ sensors, and lack effective short-term LSWT forecasting and early warning capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we established a high-frequency, real-time, and accurate monitoring and forecasting method for the LSWT based on a novel hyperspectral proximal sensing system (HPSs). An LSWT inversion method was constructed based on a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm with a satisfactory accuracy of R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.92 degrees C, MAE = 0.64 degrees C. An analysis of data collected from October 2021 to December 2023 revealed distinct seasonal fluctuations in the LSWT in the northern region of Lake Taihu, with the LSWT ranging from 2.61 degrees C to 38.52 degrees C. The hourly LSWT for the next three days was forecasted based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, with the accuracy having an R-2 = 0.99, an RMSE = 1.01 degrees C, and an MAE = 0.87 degrees C. This study complements lake water quality monitoring and early warning systems and supports a deeper understanding of dynamic processes within lake physical systems.																				2072-4292				SEP 26	2025	17	19							3303	10.3390/rs17193303	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17193303													WOS:001595053900001

This study assessed African savannah elephant habitat use around Lake Jipe in southern Kenya, across protected and unprotected areas. Using dung density as an index of African savannah elephant presence, systematic quadrant surveys were conducted in three habitat zones during both wet and dry seasons. Environmental variables, including vegetation structure and forage quality, were also evaluated to explore ecological drivers of distribution. Dung densities were consistently higher in protected areas, suggesting a preference for secure habitats. Fewer dung piles were recorded in the dry season than in the wet season, indicating possible seasonal dispersal. African savannah elephant presence declined with increasing distance from the lake, suggesting a strong attraction to lake-associated habitats. Vegetation structure differed across zones; protected areas supported higher grass cover, while unprotected areas showed greater woody species diversity, likely reflecting varied land use. However, no distinct ecological separation was found between zones, indicating localised or anthropogenic factors may influence habitat use. These findings highlight the ecological importance of both land types and suggest that effective management may benefit from spatially adaptive, seasonally informed strategies.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				SEP 26	2025	63	7							e70105	10.1111/aje.70105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.70105													WOS:001581893100001
J	Li, KY; Wang, XM; Liu, ZT; Xue, C				Li, Kunyu; Wang, Xuemei; Liu, Zitai; Xue, Cong			Characteristics and driving mechanisms of vegetation phenology variations in the Bosten Lake Basin, Xinjiang, China	PLOS ONE												Vegetation phenology functions as a highly sensitive biological metric for delineating the growth state of vegetation and mirroring environmental alterations. The exploration of its spatiotemporal variations and driving forces constitutes a key area within contemporary global change research. Leveraging MODIS NDVI data spanning from 2001 to 2023, this research derived phenology parameters for the Bosten Lake Basin in Xinjiang, China. The Sen+Mann-Kendall approach was utilized to analyze vegetation phenology trends, and the partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) was applied to quantitatively disclose the direct and indirect influences of climate, terrain, soil, and human activities on phenology. The findings indicated that over the past 23 years, the start of growing season (SOS) in the Bosten Lake Basin was predominantly concentrated between the 120th and 150th days, and it progressively advanced from the western to the eastern part. The end of growing season (EOS) fluctuated between the 240th and 270th days and gradually postponed from west to east. The length of the growing season (LOS) is mainly between 105 and 140 days and gradually lengthens from west to east. In the past 23 years, SOS advanced at an average rate of 8.9 days per decade, EOS advanced by 1.7 days per decade, and LOS extended by an average of 7.2 days per decade. The phenological parameters of diverse vegetation types demonstrated marked disparities. Needleleaf forests and cultivated vegetation exhibited earlier SOS, later EOS, and longer LOS, whereas alpine vegetation had the shortest growing season, approximately 73 days. With the increase of elevation, SOS was significantly delayed, EOS was significantly advanced, and LOS was significantly shortened (p < 0.05 for all). The direct impacts of climatic factors on SOS, EOS, and LOS were significant (p < 0.01), with total impacts of 1.03, -0.94, and -1.00, respectively. Among these climatic factors, temperature and precipitation are the most representative variables reflecting the influence of climate on phenology. Altitude indirectly affects phenology through climate, soil conditions, and human activities. Understanding the phenological change characteristics and driving mechanisms in the Bosten Lake Basin provides a basis for clarifying the ecological environment evolution and climate response in arid regions of China.																				1932-6203				SEP 25	2025	20	9							e0332896	10.1371/journal.pone.0332896	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332896								40997054					WOS:001580875300023

Crab aquaculture pond sediments, being rich in organic matter and nitrogen, may serve as hotspots for active DAMO processes. However, the presence of DAMO-functional microorganisms in such environments remains unconfirmed. In this study, we employed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to analyze the abundance variations of DAMO functional microorganisms in crab pond sediments across different temporal (May, September, December) and vertical (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm) scales. Combined with concurrent physicochemical parameter measurements and high-throughput sequencing, the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and environmental drivers of DAMO microbiota were investigated. The results indicated that DAMO bacteria and archaea coexisted in crab pond sediments, exhibiting significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in microbial abundance. The copy number of bacterial pmoA gene ranged from 2.07 x 105 to 1.89 x 107 copies g-1 dry sediment, and archaeal mcrA gene ranged from 7.15 x 105 to 1.16 x 108 copies g-1 dry sediment. The abundance of both pmoA and mcrA genes peaked in December across all sampling timepoints, with their highest enrichment in the 10-20 cm sediment layer vertically, presumably due to the synergistic effect of a stable anaerobic environment, sufficient substrate supply, and moderate environmental parameters. Temperature, pH, and nitrite concentration were identified as key environmental factors regulating DAMO microbial abundance and spatial distribution. Furthermore, both microbial community composition and diversity indices displayed pronounced spatiotemporal variability, with seasonal variations exerting stronger impacts on community structure than vertical gradients. Notably, methane-metabolizing archaea exhibited higher species diversity than methane-metabolizing bacterial communities. This study systematically elucidates the ecological distribution patterns and environmental response mechanisms of DAMO-functional microorganisms in crab pond sediments, providing a theoretical framework for methane emission mitigation strategies in aquaculture systems based on DAMO processes.

Here, we present a new approach using adjacent oxic and seasonally suboxic lakes from Iceland to 1) better understand the impacts of redox potential on these molecular proxies, and 2) reconstruct Holocene climate, human settlement, and plant history. We observe that oxic lakes provide more reliable branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers-based paleotemperature records, possibly due to the diminished presence of bacterial communities associated with reducing environments. On the other hand, oxic conditions in shallow lakes, which are often targeted for ancient DNA, can lead to poor preservation. By combining oxic and suboxic lake sediment records, we show that natural climate, and not humans, has controlled Holocene vegetation changes in northeast Iceland, and therefore provides ideal constraints for Earth system models.

However, it has experienced increasing freshwater resource scarcity in recent decades. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of lake inundation and its driving forces is therefore essential. This study develops a deep learning-based identification framework that integrates a knowledge-guided adaptive fusion network with probability mapping. Using batch-processed Landsat imagery from 1994 to 2023 on the Google Earth Engine platform, lake inundation was mapped and temporal trends were analysed. New hydrological insights for the region: The results reveal pronounced interannual and seasonal fluctuations in Lake Poyang's inundation extent. Both the yearly mean and yearly minimum inundated areas exhibit statistically significant declining trends over the past 30 years (-16.43 km2/yr and-21.51 km2/yr, respectively). Causal analyses highlight the influence of local climatic conditions and upstream hydrological changes across multiple temporal scales. The findings offer a novel method for attributing freshwater resource change and caution against attributing Lake Poyang's shrinkage solely to either local climate change or upstream dam construction.

However, quantifying this contribution is a challenge due to the complex river networks and artificial drainage in polders. To address this challenge, a Phosphorus Dynamic model for lowland Polders (PDP) was coupled with the HEC-RAS model for river network, and applied to quantify the impacts of P-controlling strategies implemented in 334 polders on 1147 river sections in the Huxi Region of Lake Taihu Basin, eastern China. The PDP and HEC-RAS models demonstrated acceptable performance in simulating water level and total phosphorus (TP) concentration, with an R-2 value range of 0.58-0.87 and 0.59-0.71, respectively. Our modelling results in 2018 indicated a TP load of 206.5 t yr(-1) (TP load intensity is 1.37 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) from these polders to connected rivers, with the hot spot (i.e., TP load intensity >1.37 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) located in the western/southern area, and the peak load occurring during the rice season (contributing 75.6 %). This spatial pattern of TP load was inconsistent with river TP concentration, with hot-spot occurring in the area between Lakes Gehu and Changdang (TP concentration >0.1 mg L-1). The combined P-controlling strategy of controlled-release fertilizers and no-tillage farming practices was identified as the best management practice, reducing TP load by 25.3 % in 68 polders and improving TP concentrations in 40.64 % of the river sections. This study demonstrated the high potential for controlling river TP by reducing P loss from polders.

However, systematic data on the magnitude and forms of P loss across the full rice growing season under such management are lacking. Here, we conducted a field experiment in the high-altitude region of the Erhai Lake Basin, Yunnan Province, China, to quantify P loss pathways and evaluate mitigation strategies. The experiment included four fertilization regimes-no fertilizer (CK), pure chemical fertilizer (PF), conventional organic fertilizer (OF), and combined organic-inorganic fertilizer (OC), and gradient of P application-no-phosphorus (NP), low-phosphorus (14 kg P ha-1), medium-phosphorus (39 kg P ha-1), and high-phosphorus (68 kg P ha-1). Total phosphorus (TP), dissolved P (DP), and particulate P (PP) in surface water, runoff, and leachate were dynamically monitored throughout the rice season. Across treatments, P loss was dominated by DP (52.9-92.3 % of TP), with leaching as the principal pathway (67.9-92.5 % of total P loss). Compared with OF and PF, the OC treatment reduced total P loss by 24.8 % and 57.0 %, respectively, while maintaining high yields (13,192 kg ha-1) and achieving a high P use efficiency (33.3 %). When soil available phosphorus (AP) exceeded 84.0 mg kg-1, leaching P concentrations increased exponentially with it. These findings suggest that combined organic-inorganic fertilization, together with P input not exceeding 23 kg P ha-1, can effectively mitigate P loss risk while meeting crop nutrient demands in high P paddy fields of the Erhai Lake Basin. This study provides critical evidence for optimizing fertilization strategies to curb agricultural non-point source P pollution, with broad implications for regional water quality management and sustainable agriculture.																			0959-6526	1879-1786				SEP 20	2025	525								146585	10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146585													WOS:001568174300001

However, the extraction of high-resolution sub-millimetre (seasonal to annual) and uncontaminated discrete subsamples from fresh sediment cores has proven difficult, time-consuming and labour-intensive. Obtaining such samples is essential for determining the relationship between measurable sediment proxies and specific climate variables, as well as for the quantification of paleoproxies. In this technical note we present a freeze-melt technique for a high-resolution subsampling of sediment sequences. This method is based on freezing and melting of fresh sediments to obtain very thin discrete subsamples. We provide details of the method and application examples using two case studies (10Be, 137Cs) with clastic-biogenic varves from lakes Nautaj & auml;rvi and Ristij & auml;rvi in Finland.

To correct this, the present study integrates field-based observations with the Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) model to comprehensively assess the conjunct effects of urban expansion and changing precipitation patterns on watershed hydrology and phosphorus dynamics at the small-catchment scale. A total of five urban expansion scenarios and three precipitation enhancement scenarios were simulated to capture both seasonal and event-driven variations in daily discharge and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. The model was calibrated and validated using in situ water quality data, ensuring high reliability of the simulations. The results indicate that agricultural non-point sources are the primary contributor to total phosphorus (TP) loads. During the overlapping period of intensive farming and heavy rainfall (June-July), TP concentrations more than doubled compared to other months, with these two months accounting for over 70% of the annual TP load. Urban expansion significantly amplified hydrological extremes, increasing peak discharge by up to 224% under extreme rainfall, thereby intensifying flood risks. Although increased precipitation diluted TP concentrations, it simultaneously accelerated overall phosphorus export. This study offers a novel modeling-monitoring framework tailored for small watersheds and provides critical insights into how land use transitions and climate change jointly reshape nutrient cycling. The findings support the development of targeted, scenario-based strategies to mitigate eutrophication risks in vulnerable river systems.					deng, zhong/NHP-0186-2025; Zhu, Jianqiang/AAB-5237-2019															2073-4441				SEP 19	2025	17	18							2771	10.3390/w17182771	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17182771													WOS:001579516700001

This study uses the high-resolution CMFD 2.0 dataset and the VIC model to evaluate spatiotemporal trends in precipitation and natural streamflow from 1951 to 2020. The results show a significant increase in annual precipitation in the upper basin (1.10 mm yr(-1), p < 0.05), particularly during the wet season, with spatially concentrated increases along the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The VIC model performed reliably across major stations, with NSE > 0.9 and PBIAS within +/- 10% during calibration. Natural streamflow trends are spatially heterogeneous: upper mainstream stations (e.g., Shigu, Panzhihua, Zhutuo) exhibit significant increases (6.25-14.58 m(3)/s per year), while lower stations remain stable or decline. Seasonally, wet-season streamflow increased in the upper basin, whereas dry-season streamflow decreased in the middle and lower reaches. At Yichang, natural simulations reveal growing seasonal extremes, with rising wet-season and declining dry-season flows (-19.06 m(3)/s yr(-1)). Human interventions have partially offset these extremes. Since 1990, observed peak discharge at Yichang during the wet season has decreased by 10.04% compared to natural streamflow, while the dry-season minimum discharge has increased by 27.63%. This shows that large reservoirs help reduce flood peaks and increase low flows. These findings highlight the intensifying impacts of climate variability and human regulation on hydrological processes and provide a scientific basis for adaptive water resource management in large river basins.

Eight fish species were collected during dry and rainy seasons. 3 fish anatomical sites (muscles, brain and liver) were analysed for Pb, Cd, Cu, Co, Mn, Fe, Cr, and Ni using atomic absorption spectrometry, and fatty acid profile using gas chromatography technique. Maximum concentration of Cd (1.321 mg/kg) in O. niloticus, was above WHO limit (0.5 mg/kg). Mean PTEs concentration of fish tissues followed decreasing order: Cd > Cr > Co > Mn > Fe > Ni > Pb > Cu (dry season); Cr > Fe > Cd > Co > Pb > Cu = Ni > Mn (rainy season). The & sum;n-3PUFA (% dry weight) in fish tissues ranged from 42.22 (O. niloticus) to 349.63 (X. nigri), with docosahexaenoic acid as main contributor in the muscles of X. nigri. Fat contents of all the fish species in dry season were higher than rainy season values, except X. nigri. Risk metal assessment of P.mariae, N. notopterus, and C.zilli had its muscles, brain and liver exceeding cancer risk permissible limit for Cd and Cr for all age groups, indicating potential health hazards for exposed subjects. The total PTEs intake is 1.76 mg/kg per week or 91.81 mg/kg per year in rainy season, hence, strict regulatory control is recommended to ensure food safety.																			0025-326X	1879-3363				JAN	2026	222		2						118730	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2025.118730	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2025.118730		SEP 2025						40974799					WOS:001578602700001

In shallow Central Asian lakes, where the seasonal ice cover mainly consists of columnar congelation ice, sunlight penetration enables strong interactions between ice and water. The evolution of ice cover in Lake Ulansu (Ulansuhai, Wuliangsuhai) in northern China was investigated via the High-resolution Thermodynamic Snow and Ice (HIGHTSI) model. Atmospheric forcing was provided by calibrated ERA5 reanalysis data, and the initial freeze-up dates were identified from remote sensing observations. A new parameterization of the water-ice heat flux (F-w), which is suitable for shallow lakes, was proposed as F-w = aQ(sw) + b, where Q(sw) represents the solar heating of water and a and b are fitted coefficients. The model showed high correlations (>0.9) and low errors (<5 cm for ice thickness; <2 degrees C for ice temperature) with respect to field observations. Throughout the ice season, long- and shortwave radiation promoted ice growth and melting, respectively. Surface melting and sublimation accounted for 9.5% and 9.8%, respectively, of the total ice decay, and the water-ice heat flux F-w =-17.5 +/- 13.0 W m(-2) was critical for simulation accuracy. Furthermore, despite the shallow depth, the lake released over 100 Wm(-2 )of heat into the atmosphere for 2 days after break-up. These findings highlight the climatic sensitivity and support sustainable water resource management of more than 10,000 shallow lakes in Central Asia.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP 18	2025	61	9							e2025WR040070	10.1029/2025WR040070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2025WR040070													WOS:001575118300001

This research examines the dynamic inundation frequency of the Nhecol & acirc;ndia region, one of the Pantanal's most famous landscapes, using high-resolution time-series images from PlanetScope nanosatellites processed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The region consists of a complex wetland with a mosaic of saline and freshwater lakes, as well as intermittently flooded water channels. The results reveal seasonal fluctuations in water surfaces across three pilot areas, highlighting substantial changes during flood events. Notably, Area 1 experienced a 16.7% increase in the water surface area at peak flooding, while Areas 2 and 3 recorded increases of 24.3% and 33.5%, respectively. These changes significantly alter the landscape, as freshwater lakes overflow and merge into a single feature along the water channels. The analysis indicates asynchronous flooding dynamics among the areas, driven by local precipitation and evaporation rates, along with the region's low topographic gradient. Additionally, this study underscores the advantages of nanosatellite imagery, demonstrating spatial and temporal information gain over traditional satellite systems, enabling detailed mapping of seasonal floods and small water features. The outcomes include flood frequency maps, water surface area evolution charts, and RGB visualizations of spatiotemporal flood patterns. These products represent the first high-resolution systematic record of seasonal flooding for the studied areas. The findings contribute to understanding the hydrological behavior of the Nhecol & acirc;ndia region, providing a scientific foundation for further research and management strategies in vulnerable wetland ecosystems.

A Neural Network-Based Estimate of the Seasonal to Inter-Annual Variability of the Lake Superior Carbon Cycle	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lake Superior emits and absorbs CO2 with significant seasonal and interannual variability, which complicates efforts to constrain its carbon cycle. While it regains atmospheric CO2 equilibrium on sub-annual scales, resulting in a sustained rise in observed pCO2 over the last two decades, significant gaps in observation have prevented examination of variability in its carbon cycle on smaller temporal or spatial scales. We developed a reconstruction of daily mean Lake Superior surface water pCO2 and CO2 lake-air flux with a spatial resolution of 0.02 degrees 0.02 degrees in order to infer trends and drivers of carbon cycling in Lake Superior on seasonal to interannual scales. A feed-forward neural network was trained and tested on underway pCO2 measurements spanning ice-free seasons of 2019-2023, yielding a spatially-comprehensive product describing inorganic carbon dynamics over a five-year period. Lake Superior alternated between net annual CO2 influx and efflux, with values ranging from (influx) to (efflux) and a 5 year mean net annual . This refinement of Lake Superior's carbon budget juxtaposes the lake's large seasonal and interannual variability against a mean net annual balance of carbon sources and sinks, and opens the door to further applications of machine learning reconstruction of lacustrine biogeochemical cycling.

However, the key factors and how they determine N runoff loss in rice cropping systems, remain unclear at a national scale. This study collected 560 data sets from 86 published papers, using the Random Forest Ranking and Piecewise Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to determine key factors and their linkage to N runoff loss in the Chinese rice cropping systems. The results showed that the average N runoff loss was 9.52 kg N ha-1 season-1 in the Chinese rice cropping systems, and the average N runoff loss was significantly higher in the paddy rice system (PRS) compared to the paddy rice-upland rotation system (PRURS) (10.40 vs. 8.60 kg N ha-1 season-1). The Random Forest Ranking determined that precipitation, N fertilization rate, and total soil N (TSN) were identified as key influencing factors for N runoff loss, while soil elemental stoichiometric ratios (e.g., C:N:P) were negatively correlated with N runoff loss, and the later factors highlighted the importance of paddy soil biogeochemical cycling in regulating N runoff loss in the Chinese rice cropping systems. Soil C:N:P and soil nutrient properties were more influential in the PRS, whereas N fertilization rate and precipitation were more critical in the PRURS. The Piecewise SEM suggested that the pathway effects of the composite variables of fertilization rate, soil nutrient properties, and soil C:N:P on N runoff loss were ranked as follows: Fertilization (0.52) > Soil nutrient properties (0.29) > Soil C:N:P (-0.14), in the Chinese rice cropping systems. The pathway effects of the three composite variables were ranked as Fertilization (0.52) > Soil nutrient properties (0.38) > Soil C:N:P ratio (-0.19) in the PRS, and Fertilization (0.52) > Soil nutrient properties (0.13) > Soil C:N:P ratio (-0.10) in the PRURS. This indicate that soil nutrient properties and the soil C:N:P ratio exert stronger effects on N runoff loss in the PRS than in the PRURS. These results provide deeper insights for mitigating N runoff loss and improving N use efficiency, and they highlight the critical role of soil elemental stoichiometry in regulating N migration and transformation within paddy water in rice cropping systems in China.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				OCT 1	2025	319								109778	10.1016/j.agwat.2025.109778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2025.109778		SEP 2025											WOS:001576756700001

The Hydrodynamic, Thermodynamic, and Mixing Impacts of Floating Photovoltaics on the Surface of a Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The use of floating photovoltaic panels (FPVs) on lakes and reservoirs is expanding globally. However, their impacts on water column motion, mixing, and thermal stratification remain poorly understood, often characterized by overly simplistic modeling approaches. Here, three-dimensional simulations, supported by analytical calculations, are used to understand the internal transport processes and mixing dynamics of an idealized lake with anchored floating structures under a range of conditions. The effects of FPVs on lake physics include: (a) increased thermal inertia with greater areal coverage, delaying and attenuating seasonal oscillations; (b) perturbations in surface equilibrium temperatures; (c) altered surface heat fluxes in uncovered areas due to lateral heat redistribution, resulting in either increased (conductive FPVs) or decreased (insulating FPVs) near-surface temperatures; (d) reduced vertical mixing rates and mixed layer depths, depending on areal coverage and spatial arrangement of the FPVs in relation to the boundaries; (e) changes in the internal dynamics and velocity fields of the lake in response to the spatial arrangement of the devices; (f) higher rates of mechanical energy exchange across the air-water interface and greater horizontal transport between covered and uncovered regions for lower areal coverages; and (g) a greater fraction of the mechanical energy flux into the lake being used to enhance lateral transport rather than vertical mixing.

Water, sediment and fish samples were collected in December 2023 and May 2024. The samples were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by using GC-MS/MS. Total PCB concentrations in water, sediment and fish ranged from < MDL to 4.372 +/- 0.957 mu g/L, < MDL to 4.217 +/- 0.968 mu g/kg and < MDL to 5.849 +/- 0.953 mu g/kg, respectively.

Blood UV absorbents in urban breeding herring gulls: Annual environmental conditions, not anthropogenic habitat use, drive exposure	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Urban-adapted wildlife foraging in coastal areas are exposed to mixtures of synthetic contaminants, including ultraviolet absorbents (UVAs), such as benzotriazole UV stabilizers (BZT-UVs) and organic UV filters (UVFs). Herring gulls (Larus argentatus), known for their foraging plasticity, are particularly susceptible to UVA exposure due to their reliance on anthropogenic habitats, including landfills, known as sinks of products containing UVAs. However, the impact of foraging habitat on exposure is unknown. We aimed to investigate this relationship in gulls along the St. Lawrence estuary near the industrial center of Que<acute accent>bec City (QC, Canada) over two breeding seasons (2023 and 2024). Eight BZT-UVs and five UVFs were measured in the plasma and red blood cells (RBC) of breeding adults. We detected UVAs in both blood compartments of the gulls sampled, with two BZT-UVs (UV-328 and UV-P) and two UVFs (BP-3 and HMS) being the most prevalent. Year was a strong predictor for most frequently detected UVA concentrations, while both year and temperature influenced Sigma BZT-UVs, Sigma UVFs, HMS, and UV-P. Specifically, one year had colder environmental conditions, which contributed to higher concentrations. This study is the first to demonstrate blood compartmentalization of UVAs between plasma and RBC, with higher concentrations found in RBC. Despite UVA exposure among all individuals and predominant foraging in anthropogenic terrestrial habitats, primarily agricultural fields, we found no association between habitat types and concentrations. Our findings suggest that UVA pollution is pervasive across diverse anthropogenic habitats, highlighting the complex pathways of exposure in urban-adapted wildlife and the need for broader monitoring.

Geographic origins and genetics of eastern and Great Lakes mallards	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Eastern and Great Lakes populations of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) have experienced a significant decline in recent years. These subpopulations are increasingly wild x game-farm mallard hybrids because of widespread releases of game-farm individuals. Concurrent with an increasing prevalence of releases, a near 50% decline in mallard populations in the United States occurred, while abundances remained stable in Canada. We aimed to refine our understanding of the metapopulation dynamics of eastern North American and Great Lakes mallards to provide information useful in population and harvest management. We used stable isotope and genetic techniques during pre-hunting season (July-September) banding to determine if banding location was representative of hatch or molt origin of mallards and if wild mallards captured and banded had more northern origins than wild x game-farm hybrids. Mallards are expected to be largely of local origin during the pre-hunting season, but nearly 50% of our sample had an origin north of their banding site, suggesting substantial movements during the banding period. We detected a similar percentage of wild x game-farm hybrid prevalence for the eastern mallard population (similar to 89%), but a substantial increase in the Great Lakes region (similar to 75%) compared to prior studies. However, we did not detect strong evidence for geographic or temporal variation in isotopic values (i.e., origins) of wild and hybrid mallards, which suggests that genotypes of mallards occurred together throughout the sampling period. Our results suggest that banding location of mallards in eastern North America does not equate to breeding ground origin or genotype (wild or hybrid), and we recommend investigation of other methods to understand if vital metrics differ among regions and genotypes. The movement we inferred during the banding season could potentially violate important assumptions that birds do not move among banding units and confound population vital rates estimated using banding returns. Thus, we recommend that current integrated population models consider eastern mallards as a single population because their movement throughout the banding period makes assessment at smaller geographic units invalid.

We examined the relation between air pollution and semen quality in the Folic Acid and Zinc Supplementation Trial (2013-2018), which enrolled male partners of couples seeking infertility treatment in the Salt Lake City, Utah region (n = 2015). Semen quality parameters were assessed at baseline, 2-, 4-, and 6-months follow-up. Measures of daily air pollutants at each participant's residence were abstracted from Community Multiscale Air Quality models (fine particulate matter: PM2.5, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone: O3), linked to participants' residential addresses, and averaged across the 74-day spermatogenesis window prior to the sample collection date for each study visit, and across four developmental windows of spermatogenesis (mitosis, meiosis I-II, spermiogenesis, and spermiation). Generalized linear mixed models considered four repeated semen sample measures per participant and adjusted for co-pollutants, age, season, and income. In multi-pollutant models, O3 during early-to-mid spermatogenesis (meiosis I+II and spermiogenesis) was related to lower percent normal morphology (% difference -6.73, 95 % CI -9.82, -3.54 and % difference -3.83, 95 % CI -7.51, 0.00, respectively). Additionally, PM2.5 and O3 during late spermatogenesis (spermiation) were associated with lower count and concentration, and PM2.5 with lower progressive motility. These findings suggest that exposure to low-tomoderate levels of air pollution may negatively impact semen quality and indicate that exposure to O3 during meiosis and spermiogenesis may particularly affect normal sperm morphological development.

Given the rapid increase in the popularity of artificial intelligence methods for remote sensing of glacial lakes, a comprehensive review is essential. We survey a decade (2015-2024) of research on glacial lake monitoring from space, with a focus on classical machine learning and deep learning approaches. We identify key trends, research gaps, and best practices for future studies. Most studies rely on optical imagery, especially Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, while Sentinel-1 serves as a complementary radar source. However, monitoring glacial lakes in mountainous regions remains a challenge on cloudy days due to the limitations of radar and the unusability of optical data. Deep learning, particularly U-Net and DeepLab derivatives, dominates learning-based glacial lake studies but remains computationally demanding. Critical challenges involve balancing performance gains against trade-offs in data availability, computational cost, and model transferability. Geographic and methodological gaps, especially in regions experiencing rapid lake growth, underscore the need for broader spatial coverage and improved spatiotemporal model generalization. Moreover, transitioning from a focus on static seasonal mapping to frequent multi-temporal monitoring is beneficial for understanding glacial lake evolution and outburst flood hazards. Adapting emerging deep learning architectures to integrate multispectral, hyperspectral, and radar data could enhance glacial lake detection capabilities. Furthermore, thorough inter-method comparisons, benchmarking with rigorous evaluation metrics, and open-sourcing datasets and code would facilitate robust, large-scale glacial lake monitoring efforts.

Although land uses, seasonal variations, and trophic status collectively influence the spectral characteristics of lake DOM, the mechanistic drivers underlying its spatiotemporal dynamics remain poorly understood, particularly in ecologically fragile plateau lake regions. In this study, we systematically characterized physicochemical parameters, trophic state, and DOM spectral properties in the nearshore waters of Lake Lugu across different land use types, using seasonal water quality monitoring coupled with absorption and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results indicated that the water in the Caohai (CH) lake region adjacent to the cultivated land-wetland complex exhibited significantly higher Trophic State Index (TSI) values than those in other lake regions. CH serves as a significant source of nutrients input to Lake Lugu, particularly during the rainy season. Additionally, DOM components analysis revealed that autochthonous components, C3 (humic-like substances derived from macrophyte decomposition) and C4 (tryptophan-like fluorescence produced by phytoplankton), constitute the primary components of DOM in Lake Lugu. Across lake areas with elevated trophic status, the fluorescent components of DOM demonstrates a higher proportion of allochthonous components alongside enhanced aromaticity and humification, indicating that eutrophication process remodels its spectral characteristics and fluorescence components of DOM. Furthermore, under the combined influence of rainfall and prevailing winds, the CH cultivated land-wetland complex facilitated the transport of substantial amounts of humic-like substances into Lake Lugu. Plateau lakes serve as sensitive indicators for global change, and this study provides a theoretical foundation for eutrophication prevention and carbon sink management for plateau lakes.

This study investigates the seasonal distribution characteristics of six BPs in seawater from the Pearl River Estuary of the Northern South China Sea during wet and dry seasons. Our results reveal a significant increase in BP concentrations compared to historical data, with a notable decline in bisphenol A (BPA) proportions and a corresponding rise in bisphenol S levels. BP concentrations were higher during the wet season than in the dry season. Furthermore, BPA, bisphenol B, bisphenol AF, and bisphenol P demonstrated strong bioconcentration potential within marine food webs. Environmental factors significantly influence the presence of BPs in dolphin habitats. The frontal processes may indirectly modulate the distribution and apparent bioavailability of BPs by altering environmental fields such as salinity, chlorophyll a. Elevated BP levels pose substantial risks to ecosystem health, particularly due to their toxicity to marine invertebrates and humpback dolphin calves. These findings deepen our understanding of the ecological risks of BPs on coastal ocean ecosystem, while also highlighting the ongoing threat that BPA alternatives pose to the conservation of cetaceans.

Here we investigate the temporal variability in dissolved chemistry and isotopic ratios from two major rivers on the Tibetan Plateau, the Jinsha River and the Yalong River, over two periods within a nineyear span (2013-2014 and 2018-2021). In the evaporite-rich, permafrost-dominated Jinsha River basin, we detected exceptional increases in evaporite-derived elemental concentrations and fluxes, both interannually and during the monsoon season, compared with other mineral sources. These shifts reflect enhanced evaporite exposure driven by warming-induced thermal processes such as permafrost thaw, altered subsurface flow paths, and enhanced hydrologic connectivity between saline lakes and rivers. By contrast, weathering fluxes in the evaporite-poor Yalong River basin exhibit relatively small temporal changes. Sulfide oxidation offsets all silicate weathering-driven alkalinity in the Jinsha River basin and 40-98% in the Yalong River basin, with the offset intensifying during monsoon-driven permafrost-thaw-and high-flow periods. Concurrently, accelerated gypsum/ anhydrite weathering could prompt CO2 release from soils and streams by inducing secondary carbonate precipitation. Interannually, the growing dominance of sulfide oxidation also shifts the CO2 balance toward net CO2 release. These processes demonstrate that mineral weathering associated with permafrost thaw can strengthen CO2 sources to the atmosphere and amplify the permafrost carbon-climate feedback. Overall, global warming and the associated acceleration of the hydrologic cycle could result in CO2 release rather than drawdown from rock weathering in permafrost landscapes underlain by sulfide-and evaporite-rich lithologies.

Meltwater ponding has an underestimated radiative effect on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Ponding of meltwater on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet has the potential to reduce ice sheet albedo and amplify mass loss. However, this process remains poorly constrained and is absent from models that project ice sheet mass balance. Here we demonstrate that meltwater ponding considerably increases the amount of energy available for melting the Greenland Ice Sheet. We first use satellite-derived products to show that meltwater ponding has a significant impact on spatial albedo patterns, particularly in the lower percolation zone. We then use drone imagery to demonstrate that, in the upper ablation zone, there are thousands of narrow streams and small pools (<100 m(2)) that collectively account for >50% of the total meltwater area. These small meltwater features are not resolved by surface water maps derived from medium-resolution satellite imagery, signifying that the radiative effect of meltwater ponding is three to four times stronger than predicted by satellite-based approaches. Our findings therefore place lower bounds on the radiative effect of meltwater ponding that could be used to advocate for the inclusion of this process into models that forecast Greenland Ice Sheet's contribution to sea-level rise.

To address this gap, we analyzed metagenomes from 26 lakes in the boreal and subarctic zones, along with one tropical reservoir, to characterize fungal and fungal-like (Oomycota) community structure. We also examined environmental factors shaping these communities. Most variation in fungal composition was explained by lake identity, depth layer, and season, with total organic carbon as a significant explanatory variable. Despite geographic and time differences, dominant fungal phyla, orders, and genera were largely consistent across all lakes. However, genus-level variation indicated distinct community compositions likely influenced by differences in carbon substrate availability. Attempts to classify metagenomic reads down to the species level-illustrated here through the well-characterized oomycete genus Phytophthora-were constrained by the limited taxonomic resolution of current reference databases. While metagenomics offers powerful means to investigate entire microbial communities, our results underscore a persistent bottleneck: the insufficient representation of aquatic eukaryotic genomes in public databases.

Our present work reveals that climate can obscure the effect of tectonic subsidence by regulating sediment supply; conversely, tectonics can impede the sedimentary manifestation of climatic impacts. Here a case study has been presented to assess the impact of climate-modulated rapid lake-level rise and tectonic subsidence on the development of coarse-grained gravity flow deposits in the Dongying rift margin of the Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China. The lithofacies analysis reveals frequent bed amalgamation, abundant thick massive coarse-grained deposits, widespread cross bedding and plant fragments, and incomplete composite bed formed by high-energy erosion, indicating that the hyperpycnal flow is an important mechanism driving the deposition of these coarse-grained sediments. Detailed sequence stratigraphic analysis and sediment dispersal pattern suggest that the long-striped nearshore subaqueous fan systems induced by outburst-flood hyperpycnal flow distributed along the border fault, are primarily controlled by long-term tectonics, while the rapid rise of lake level driven by short-term climate change possibly intensifies seasonal flood-generated hyperpycnal flow occurrences and consequently promotes the basinal fan progradation. The maximum scale of these coarse-grained gravity flow deposits of the basinal fan systems are typically attained during the transgressive systems tract, which deviates from the classical sequence stratigraphic model. Furthermore, it presented a continuous transition from the proximal to the distal part, encompassing traction flows and turbidity currents during the periods of relatively stable tectonics. Nevertheless, gravel-rich debris flows appear to predominate the dispersion of coarse-grained sediments during periods characterized by intense tectonic activity. The coarse-grained gravity flow deposits in the lacustrine rift margin reported here, challenge the traditional beliefs: this study suggests that subaqueous deposits abundantly preserved in the transgressive setting.

To address these issues, we developed a novel attention physical-guided spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network (A-PSTGCN) that uses convective diffusion equations as physical constraints to predict spatiotemporal total P (TP) concentrations at multiple locations and an attention-based method to trace pollution sources. Applied to the Taihu Lake Basin, a typical tidal river network in China, the A-PSTGCN improves TP concentration prediction accuracy by 15.0 %-95.1 % in NashSutcliffe Efficiency compared to the Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network, the Graph Convolutional Network integrated with Long Short-Term Memory Network, and the Convolutional Neural Network integrated with Long Short-Term Memory Network. It also effectively identifies the primary pollution source in Gehu Lake under varying seasonal and hydraulic engineering conditions. Before the Xinmeng River extension, non-point sources were the primary pollution source during the wet season (55.1 %), whereas point sources dominated in the dry season (71.8 %). After the extension, the Yangtze River' TP flux increased in the dry season (26.8 %) due to increased water supply. Furthermore, analysis of flow velocities and TP dynamics before and after Xinmeng River extension revealed 0.19 m s-1 as the pivotal flow velocity where dilution-induced concentration reduction balances sediment resuspension-induced concentration increase. The new explainable process-guided deep learning model developed herein can accurately predict TP concentrations and effective identify major pollution sources. Moreover, it highlights the pivotal role of hydrodynamics, which is shaped by hydraulic engineering and hydrological variability, in influencing pollutant migration within tidal river networks.

As global temperatures rise, the accelerated thawing of permafrost releases greenhouse gases, exacerbating climate change. However, freshly thawed permafrost carbon may also experience lateral transport by groundwater flow to surface water recipients such as rivers and lakes, increasing the terrestrial-to-aquatic transfer of permafrost carbon. Mobilization and subsurface transport mechanisms are poorly understood and not accounted for in global climate models, leading to high uncertainties in the predictions of the permafrost carbon feedback. Here, we focus on a hillslope in Endalen Valley, Svalbard, as a representative example of a high-Arctic hillslope underlain by continuous permafrost. We analyze solute transport in the form of a non-reactive tracer representing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using a physics-based numerical model with the objective to study governing cryotic and hydrodynamic transport mechanisms relevant for warming permafrost regions. We first analyze transport times for DOC pools at different locations within the active layer under present-day climatic conditions and proceed to study susceptibility for deeper ancient carbon release in the upper permafrost due to thaw under different warming scenarios. Results suggest that DOC in the active layer near the permafrost table experiences rapid lateral transport upon thaw due to saturated conditions and lateral flow, while DOC close to the ground surface experiences slower transport due to flow in unsaturated soil. Deeper permafrost carbon release exhibits vastly different transport behaviors depending on warming and thaw rate. Gradual warming leads to small fractions of DOC being mobilized every year, while the majority moves vertically through percolation and cryosuction. Abrupt thaw resulting from a single very warm year leads to faster lateral transport times, similar to active layer DOC released in saturated conditions. Lastly, we analyze the potential susceptibility of DOC to mineralization to CO2 prior to export due to soil moisture and temperature conditions. We find that high liquid saturation during transport coincides with very low mineralization rates and potentially inhibits mineralization into CO2 before export. Overall, the results highlight the importance of subsurface hydrologic and thermal conditions for the retention and lateral export of permafrost carbon by subsurface flow.

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of water quality in Nepal's lowland riparian Ramsar wetlands. It focuses on Jagadishpur Reservoir (JR) and Nakrori Lake (NL), chosen for their ecological significance and contrasting artificial and natural features. The research examines seasonal water quality changes, identifies key hydrochemical processes, and evaluates suitability for drinking and irrigation. During pre- and post-monsoon periods, 156 water samples were collected from both lakes. Samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters, including total dissolved solids (TDS), and major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-), using standardized laboratory techniques. Statistical analyses and hydrochemical diagrams, such as Piper and Gibbs plots, revealed that both lakes exhibited similar physicochemical profiles. Ca2+-HCO3- was the dominant water type, indicating that carbonate and silicate weathering, along with cation-anion exchange, were key determinants of water chemistry. TDS levels averaged 182.7 mg/L in NL pre-monsoon and declined to 154.3 mg/L in JR post-monsoon, reflecting the effects of evaporation and monsoonal dilution. Water quality consistently met standards for both drinking and irrigation, with water quality index (WQI) and Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) < 50 and 10, respectively. These findings underscore the challenges in maintaining standard water quality and highlight the implementation of a sustainable action plan (SAP) that advances Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 by 25 % and SDG 13 by 40 % through targeted pollution mitigation and climate resilience measures. This research can provide a transferable framework for wetland conservation and policy development in similar ecosystems worldwide.

To explore the predictive capacity of these variables, we constructed 255 multiple linear regression models using different combinations of spectral bands and indices as independent variables, with phycocyanin concentration as the dependent variable. The most effective model, selected through a stepwise regression procedure, incorporated seven statistically significant predictors (p < 0.05) and took the following form: FCA = N/G + NDVI + B + GNDVI + EVI + SABI + CCI. This model achieved a strong fit to the validation data, with an R-2 of 0.85 and an RMSE of 0.10 mu g/L, indicating high explanatory power and relatively low error in phycocyanin estimation. When applied to the complete weekly time series of satellite observations, the model successfully captured both seasonal dynamics and interannual variability in phycocyanin concentrations (R-2 = 0.92; RMSE = 0.05 mu g/L). These results demonstrate the robustness and practical utility for long-term monitoring of harmful algal blooms in Lake Villarrica.

However, it is not clear whether the extreme drought before the flood season will significantly affect the DOM cycle in the river-lake continuum. Stable isotope, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis, and Fourier transform ion-cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) were used to study the influence of inflowing rivers (including rural and urban rivers) on the DOM of lake during non-flood season. The DOM of Lake Daye and its main inflowing rivers were derived from terrestrial sources, and rural rivers contributed more to the terrestrial DOM of Lake Daye. Two humic-like components (C1 and C3) and one protein-like component (C2) were identified, and C1 and C2 were the main fluorescent components. Compared to Lake Daye, the inflowing rivers (especially urban rivers) had higher hydrogen to carbon ratios and saturation degrees, but a lower molecular weight, oxygen content, aromaticity, and thermodynamic instability. Microbial activity dominated the dynamic changes of DOM in the aquatic continuum of Lake Daye basin. Considerable human activities have affected the sulfur-containing components in the inflowing rivers and further affected Lake Daye. Wastewater related unstable compounds (proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) were imported into Lake Daye by inflowing rivers, and the contribution of urban rivers was particularly prominent. This study showed that the DOM of main inflowing rivers had a profound impact on Lake Daye even during the extreme drought before the flood season. The properties and compositions of DOM in Lake Daye were more similar to rural rivers, but FT-ICR MS revealed significant differences of DOM between urban rivers and Lake Daye. Thus, even in the non-flood season under extreme drought conditions, the inflowing rivers still affect the properties and compositions of DOM in Lake Daye. In the future, it is worth paying attention to how this process affects environmental quality of Lake Daye (e.g pollutant transport and transformation).

Current monitoring practices are mainly limited by low spatial and temporal resolutions and costs. This results in the huge challenge of providing extensive and timely water quality monitoring at the global scale. In this work, we propose an image analysis procedure for river turbidity assessment using different camera systems (i.e. fixed-trap camera, camera on board an uncrewed aerial vehicle and a multispectral camera). We explored multiple types of camera installation setups during a river turbidity event artificially re-created on site. The outcomes prove that processed digital-camera data can properly represent the turbidity trends. Specifically, the experimental activities revealed that single-band values were the most reliable proxy for turbidity monitoring in the short term, more so than band ratios and indexes. The best camera positioning, orientation and lens sensitivity, as well as daily and seasonal changes in lightning and river flow conditions, may affect the accuracy of the results. The reliability of this application will be tested under different hydrological and environmental conditions during our next field experiments. The final goal of the work is the implementation of this camera system to support existing techniques and to help in finding innovative solutions to water resource monitoring.

Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal variations of N2O concentrations, fluxes and indirect emission factors (EF5r) and their drivers in Ulansuhai lake, a shallow eutrophic lake located in a semi-arid region in northern China, during 2019-2020. The mean concentration of N2O in water was 20.0 +/- 6.7 nmol/L, with a mean diffusive N2O flux of 16.50 +/- 21.52 mu mol/(m(2)<middle dot>day), indicating that this lake acted as a persistent source of atmospheric N2O. Estimated indirect emission factors (EF5r) (mean value 0.0037 +/- 0.0060) were significantly higher than the default values (0.0026) used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission inventories. The N2O concentrations, fluxes and EF5r exhibited substantial seasonal variations and small spatial variations. N2O concentrations and fluxes were positively correlated with the trophic status and EF5r increased with increasing nutrient concentrations in the water. These findings demonstrate the role of eutrophication in influencing the N2O dynamics and confirm that eutrophication can exacerbate N2O emissions.																			1001-0742	1878-7320				FEB	2026	160									10.1016/j.jes.2025.03.065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2025.03.065		SEP 2025											WOS:001584232700001

The influence of climate change on growth of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate and with longer growing seasons, greater rainfall, and less snowfall. Cold-adapted ectotherms, such as the Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus 1758), are likely to experience changes to growth as a result. Anadromous Arctic charr (charr, hereafter) are of great importance for northern communities, providing a source of income from commercial fisheries and food security from subsistence harvest. Initially, warming is expected to increase the growth of charr, benefitting subsistence and commercial fisheries in the short term. However, over longer time scales, temperatures exceeding the optimum for growth will likely result in metabolic stress, slowed growth, and higher mortality. Thus, the long-term consequences of climate change will likely be negative. We assessed anadromous charr growth from 1984 to 2013 in three stocks around Cumberland Sound using otolith measurements as proxies for age-specific growth. Trend analyses indicated growth had increased in pre-migratory ages over the years. We used mixed models to investigate changes to growth for ages 1-10 in relation to climate variables, finding that growing degree days had the greatest positive influence on ages 1-6 while annual precipitation had an overall negative effect on growth in ages 1-2 and 6-10. Contrary to previous assessments on these stocks, our results suggest charr have indeed experienced changes to growth with climate change. These findings emphasize the need for more thorough long-term growth studies in the management of fisheries as altered growth will affect food security and the economy across the Canadian Arctic.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				2025 SEP 8	2025										10.1007/s10641-025-01743-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-025-01743-2		SEP 2025											WOS:001566175800001
J	Rajora, K; Sarma, K				Rajora, Koshal; Sarma, Kiranmay			Holistic approaches to sustainable control of invasive water hyacinth: merging ecological insights with effective management strategies	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is an invasive species that rapidly multiplies and leads to the extinction of native species. These intrusions progressively destroy the natural environment of freshwater environments. Managing and controlling these species is difficult, but finding ways to turn this weed into a valuable resource can significantly help tackle this issue. This study focused on generating revenue from the water hyacinth, which is disrupting water bodies worldwide. The study serves as a case study for sustainably managing urban wetlands and water bodies. Satellite imagery from the RESOURCESAT-2 (LISS IV) sensor was used to map the water hyacinth-affected areas in the study location before (May) and after the monsoon (October) seasons. The mapping was carried out using false colour composite and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Water hyacinth samples were harvested in the pre-monsoon season from five locations, utilizing a 1 x 1 m quadrat. Water hyacinth coverage increased in the pre-monsoon season (27 hectares) compared to the post-monsoon season (14 hectares). The in-situ biomass assessment indicated a 19% reduction, with a green mass of 5.800 kg and a dry mass of 1.102 kg. Our approach to calculate the total revenue generated from the water hyacinth, considering the production of Moorhen yoga mats, has shown promising results. It was assumed that only 50% of the total mass is available, allowing for the production of around 50,000 mats. This could potentially result in domestic revenue of approximately 5.95 crores and international revenue of 7.43 crores. This approach represents a significant advancement in stakeholder engagement within the community, particularly highlighting the contributions of women's groups engaged in the production of water hyacinth mats and handicrafts. By leveraging these activities, the method not only enhances livelihood opportunities but also ensures sustainable support for indigenous communities over the long term. Eco informed strategies for managing water hyacinth focus on sustainable practices that benefit both ecological health and community needs. The strategies are resource utilization of water hyacinth, Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), Sustainable and eco-friendly harvesting techniques, continuous monitoring, and research.					; Sarma, Kiranmay/JDW-1412-2023	Rajora, Koshal/0009-0007-0186-3077; 													1387-3547	1573-1464				SEP 6	2025	27	9							206	10.1007/s10530-025-03667-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-025-03667-5													WOS:001564878300001

For instance, social network analysis can be used for assessing the transmission of diseases or information within groups. Here, we describe co-occurrences and potential social associations of ringed seals, Pusa hispida saimensis, in Lake Saimaa, Finland, from 2016 to 2022, based on photoidentification data. Throughout seven successive moulting seasons (April to June), we identified 425 individuals, of which 178 had pairwise co-occurrences in altogether 185 dyads. These seals had a variable number of associates (up to 10), and co-occurrences were observed in 1-7 years. In general, observations of pairs or larger groups of seals (up to five individuals) were rare, and mainly occurred in the two most densely populated basins of the lake. Most of the group observations occurred on ice rather than on rocks. Overall, the fragmented nature of the lake system, site fidelity and moulting habitat availability are key factors that probably affect the observed co-occurrences. Most of the dyads were observed during only one year, which may indicate social tolerance while using the same moulting site. However, 21 dyads were observed during multiple moulting seasons, with some at different sites separated by up to 3 km in different years, suggesting the existence of actual long-lasting associations. Our study represents the first description of co-occurrences and potential social associations in the endangered Saimaa ringed seal. These results can be used for designing and implementing mitigation strategies in case of unforeseen and sudden changes in the environment, such as a disease outbreak. (c) 2025 The Authors.

Change in Nematode Communities' Structure and Diversity in the Ray River Ecosystem Due to Artificial Barrage Impact, Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Nematode communities in the Ray River system were investigated in the dry and wet seasons. The construction of an irrigation dam on the Ray River formed an artificial lake to supply freshwater for regional domestic activities. Sampling included five stations in river habitat and four stations in the lake habitat to compare nematode community structures and assess differences between the two ecosystems within the same river basin. Results revealed significant differences in community composition at the genus, family, and order levels. Certain taxonomic groups exhibited distinct distribution patterns, with higher densities and diversity restricted to either lake or river habitats. Community characteristics-including density, genus richness, Shannon diversity index, Margalef richness index, Hill indices, and Hurlbert's ES(50)-were measured and showed pronounced disparities between the Ray Lake and Ray River, particularly during the wet season. These differences were attributed to dam-induced transformation of the upstream river section into a lentic (lake) ecosystem. Through nematode community analysis, the ecological impacts of the dam on river habitats were clearly demonstrated. This study highlights the sensitivity of nematodes to dam-related environmental changes, underscoring their potential utility as bioindicators for future environmental monitoring and management strategies.

A major challenge lies in the limited quality of precipitation data and constraints on model capabilities. To address these challenges, the upper and middle Tana River basin, characterized by its sensitivity to drought, vulnerability to flooding, and data availability, was selected as a case study. We performed convection-permitting (CP) regional climate simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and conducted hydrological simulations with a lake-reservoir-integrated WRF Hydrological modeling system (WRF-Hydro) driven by the CPWRF outputs. Our results show that the CPWRF-simulated precipitation outperforms ERA5 when benchmarked against Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) (IMERG), with evident bias reduction in seasonal precipitation mainly over the Mount Kenya region and with a probability of light rainfall (1-15 mmd-1) during the dry season. Improved precipitation enhances the hydrological simulation, significantly reducing false peak occurrences and increasing the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) by 0.53 in the calibrated lake-integrated WRF-Hydro model (LakeCal) driven by CPWRF output compared to ERA5-driven simulations. Additionally, the lake-reservoir module increases the sensitivity of river discharge to spin-up time and affects discharge through lake-reservoir-related parameters, although adjustments to the parameters (i.e., the runoff infiltration rate, Manning's roughness coefficient, and the groundwater component) have minimal effects on discharge, particularly during the dry season. The inclusion of the lake-reservoir module effectively reduces the model-data bias in WRF-Hydro simulations, particularly for the dry-season flow and peak flow, resulting in an NSE increase of 1.67 between LakeCal and LakeNan (model without the lake-reservoir module). Notably, 24 % of the NSE improvement is attributed to CPWRF and 76 % is attributed to the lake-reservoir module. These findings highlight the enhanced capability of hydrological modeling when combining CPWRF simulations with the lake-reservoir module, providing a valuable tool for improving flood and drought predictability in data-scarce regions like East Africa.

J	Zhang, QQ; Wang, L; Wang, HW; Zhang, XQ				Zhang, Qianqian; Wang, Long; Wang, Huiwei; Zhang, Xueqing			Nitrogen dynamics in multi-source recharge lakes: A comprehensive exploration using multi-isotopic tracing, Bayesian mixing models and structural equation models	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION												Excessive nitrogen levels have become a pressing global environmental issue, especially within lake ecosystems. Despite this, research on nitrogen dynamics within lakes fed by multiple replenishment sources are scarce. To address this gap, our study employs Baiyangdian Lake (BYDL), a quintessential example of a multi-source replenished lake, as a case study. In a novel approach, we integrated multi-isotope analysis, Bayesian mixing models (MixSIAR), and structural equation models (SEMs) to provide a systematic examination of nitrogen sources, pathways, and transformation mechanisms in such lakes. The isotopic compositions indicated that sewage, ammonium fertilizer and soil nitrogen constitute the principal nitrogen sources. The contribution of sewage to lake nitrogen varies across seasons, accounting for 54.4 %, 53.2 %, and 42.5 % during normal, flood, and dry seasons, respectively. Nitrification dominates the nitrogen cycle in BYDL, accompanied by significant assimilation and mineralization, whereas denitrification is minimal. SEM analysis revealed that the primary determinants of nitrate concentration distribution in multi-source lakes are the differentiation of nitrogen forms from replenishing water sources and the differential effects of hydrodynamic mixing, exerting a standardized total effect of 0.614 (p < 0.01). Additionally, redox conditions and organic matter content exert significant influences on nitrogen distribution. In summary, multi-isotope analysis can effectively identify nitrogen sources and elucidate their migration and transformation pathways. SEMs clarified the key factors governing nitrogen concentration distribution, while MixSIAR precisely quantified the contributions of various nitrogen sources. Together, these methodologies provide a comprehensive approach to decipher the dynamic patterns of nitrogen in multi-source lakes, deepening our understanding of nitrogen cycling in complex aquatic systems.					zhang, xueqing/KHE-5707-2024; Zhang, Qianqian/C-6476-2015														2352-1864					NOV	2025	40								104482	10.1016/j.eti.2025.104482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2025.104482		SEP 2025											WOS:001568937700006

Discovering stable genomic regions linked to powdery mildew adult-plant resistance in wheat	FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY												Wheat powdery mildew (WPM) is a devastating disease that causes significant yield losses worldwide. In Egypt, a lake in immune cultivars was reported and little is known about its genetic control. In this study, two different plant sets (the isoline set and the test set) were evaluated for WPM adult plant resistance (APR-WPM) over three cropping seasons (2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024). The results of the isoline set revealed that the Pm1b, Pm34, Pm36, MIAG12, and NACG13 resistance genes were stable among the three cropping seasons. The results of the evaluated set revealed highly significant differences among the cropping seasons as well as among the tested genotypes, suggesting the presence of different Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) races and the potential to select highly resistant genotypes. Eight resistant genotypes belonging to five different countries, excluding Egypt, were identified. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using each cropping season separately as well as the average of the three seasons. GWAS was done using two different SNP data sets, GBS and 25K-SNP array. A total of 86 significant markers associated with resistance were identified. Among these markers, only four markers were stable across at least two seasons. Three gene models harboring these markers were detected and functionally annotated to be linked with disease resistance. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that each gene model regulated a single network of different biological processes and molecular function pathways. Among the resistant genotypes, one Sudanese genotype was selected for its strong WPM resistance and high yield potential. This genotype was also found to be highly adapted to the Egyptian environment and a high-yielding genotype. The incorporation of this genotype into future breeding programs could increase the resilience of Egyptian wheat germplasm.

Zoobenthos of the Freezing Water Bodies of the Medvezh'i Ostrova Nature Reserve, East Siberian Sea	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												While monitoring the polar bears in the "Medvezh'i Ostrova" (Bear Islands) Nature Reserve in October 2023, a number of mainland water bodies were surveyed: Nesolenoe Lake and an unnamed lake, the Krestovaya River, an unnamed watercourse on Chetyrekhstolbovyi Island, and the marine bay of Kolyma Bay, all in the East Siberian Sea. Representatives of the zoobenthos were found in each of the water bodies studied, but the fauna was not very diverse. A total of only seven species of benthic invertebrates were revealed in the surveyed water bodies of the Medvezh'i Ostrova Nature Reserve, of which three species were found in sea water: Pacifoculodes pallidus (G.O. Sars 1892) (Amphipoda), Yoldiella nana (M. Sars 1865) (Bivalvia), and Enchytraeus albidus Henle 1838 (Oligochaeta). In the water bodies feeding the Galgavaam River, two species from the family Chironomidae and three species of eurytopic Oligochaeta were recorded. Their abundance ranges from 200 to 1700 ind./m2 and 0.10 to 3.70 g/m2 biomass in freshwater bodies, compared to biomass not exceeding 600 ind./m2 and 1.90 g/m2 in the sea. Seasonal cohorts are formed there, 37% of which are merohydrobionts (& Scy;hironomidae) and amphibiotic & Ocy;ligochaeta, and 13% each are neritic amphipods and bivalves. The formation of seasonal cohorts is determined by the short growing season and the extended ice formation on island and mainland watercourses and reservoirs.

J	Yang, Z; Shi, XL; Yu, Y; Zhang, M				Yang, Zhen; Shi, Xiaoli; Yu, Yang; Zhang, Min			Long-term and seasonal dynamic patterns and drivers of dissolved carbon in a shallow eutrophic lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Dissolved carbon is a crucial component of freshwater ecosystems and plays an important role in the Earth's carbon cycle. This paper delivers a groundbreaking exploration of dissolved carbon (DOC and DIC) variations spanning 12 years in a eutrophic lake where nutrient levels are gradually declining to reveal their spatial and temporal distribution patterns and the key drivers behind this variation. Our findings indicate that both DIC and DOC concentrations in Lake Chaohu exhibit a westward spatial gradient, with an overall upward trend in DIC levels from 2012 to 2023, contrasting with a downward trend in DOC. A similar variation trend in the inflowing rivers suggests that exogenous inputs predominantly dictate long-term carbon concentration changes in the lake. Additionally, a reduction of eutrophication levels in the lake may have also contributed to a decrease in endogenous DOC generated by algal metabolism. Seasonally, DIC and DOC concentrations display inverse trends throughout the year, with DOC levels closely tracking the seasonal patterns of the cyanobacterium Microcystis. Correlation and regression analyses reveal a significant positive relationship between Microcystis and DOC and a negative association with DIC, while Dolichospermum shows no correlation with either. This suggests that the impact of phytoplankton on DOC and DIC variations is species-specific. In Lake Chaohu, the annual succession of Microcystis may be a major driving factor for the intra-annual variations in DOC and DIC. Our findings deepen the comprehension of how phytoplankton modulates the intra-annual dynamics of DOC and DIC.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP 4	2025	197	10							1084	10.1007/s10661-025-14552-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-14552-y								40906038					WOS:001564035700001

Exploring host community service provision is a small but important part of a growing body of research that attempts to understand challenges faced by hosts when evacuations take place. Wildfire displacements can have long-lasting and deep social impacts, and the ability of host communities' to implement socially aware and holistic emergency management plans and coordinate with key stakeholders is an important area of inquiry. When accommodating evacuees, hosts may face social services strains, uncertainties regarding cost recovery, and traffic and hospitality congestion. As such, this paper deploys case study methods seeking answers to three research questions stemming from the 2023 Alberta Wildfires: 1) How well prepared were communities to host evacuees?; 2) What challenges did they encounter?; and 3) What lessons can be learned from their experiences? Semi-structured interviews (n = 27) across the three cases of High Level, White-court, and Hinton revealed important insights regarding community preparedness, community-specific challenges, and cross-cutting lessons learned. Major findings demonstrate the importance of intercommunity coordination, rapid needs assessments of incoming evacuees, planning efforts to provide adequate accommodations, and increased awareness around disaster relief programs and incident command training.

This study examined avian assemblages in two wetlands within the Lake Tana sub-basin: Yiganda, a relatively undisturbed site, and Chimba, which is subject to significant anthropogenic disturbance. Using a systematic random sampling approach, we conducted bird counts during both dry and wet seasons. A total of 6,432 individuals representing 95 species were recorded across both wetlands. Seasonal shifts in bird abundance differed between sites: Yiganda showed a smaller decline in abundance and diversity from the dry to wet season, suggesting greater ecological stability. In contrast, Chimba exhibited more pronounced seasonal fluctuations. Notably, significant differences in bird diversity were found between the two wetlands during the wet season, but not during the dry season. These findings underscore the importance of conserving minimally disturbed wetlands and highlight the potential for restoring degraded habitats such as Chimba to enhance regional avian biodiversity.

J	Lee, DJJ; Ludin, SFM; Wong, WW; Zhan, LY; Poh, SC				Lee, Daryl Jia Jun; Mohd Ludin, Siti Farhain; Wong, Wei Wen; Zhan, Liyang; Poh, Seng Chee			An assessment of CO2 and CH4 emissions in a tropical river: from the Kenyir Reservoir to the estuary	PEERJ												This study investigates the spatial and seasonal variations in CO2 and CH4 emissions from the Kenyir hydropower reservoir and its downstream Terengganu River system in Malaysia. Understanding these variations is crucial for assessing whether the greenhouse gas (GHG) budget for this aquatic continuum significantly contributes to global emissions. Malaysia's distinct monsoonal climate presents a unique opportunity to explore the influence of seasonal hydrological changes on GHG emission dynamics in inland waters. Five sampling campaigns were performed at the reservoir to investigate this, involving three longitudinal surveys from the reservoir downstream along the Terengganu River, and two time-series samplings at the estuary between November 2017 and August 2019. Our findings reveal that GHG emissions from the Kenyir Reservoir are notably higher during the wet season (97 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and 2 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) than during the dry season (54 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and 0.8 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). This increase coincides with increased wind speed and potential surface mixing during the wet season. Despite operating since 1985, the Kenyir Reservoir's total GHG emissions remain high compared to other global reservoirs, likely due to its tropical location and high organic carbon content. Elevated GHG emissions were recorded along the Terengganu River, near the dam discharge outlets, with gradual reductions observed downstream. Despite the estuary's smaller surface area, more GHGs are emitted there than in the river. Overall, the Terengganu River catchment emits approximately 572 Gg CO2-equivalent annually, with the Kenyir Reservoir accounting for the majority (94%). The river and the estuary contribute 0.5% and 5.5%, respectively. This study highlights the substantial role of tropical hydropower reservoirs and their downstream river networks in the global GHG budget, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the factors influencing GHG dynamics in tropical river systems.

This study investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics, migration pathways, and sources of nitrogen pollution in a typical polder system. Eight surface water sampling campaigns were conducted at 13 sites in Quyuan Polder, Dongting Lake, from 2022 to 2023, combining ArcGIS spatial analysis, multivariate statistics, and dual-isotope (delta N-15-NO-), delta O-18-NO3-) techniques. Nitrate and ammonium nitrogen dominated the nitrogen pool, accounting for similar to 76% of total nitrogen. Concentrations were higher in the dry season (2.48 mg/L) than in the wet season (1.89 mg/L) and differed significantly among hydrological periods (p < 0.05). Within the polder, total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen were elevated, whereas nitrate nitrogen was higher at the outlet, reflecting distinct nitrogen profiles along the hydrological gradient. Nitrogen transport patterns were largely consistent with flow direction, driven by both upstream inputs and in situ generation.

These findings enhance understanding of nitrogen dynamics in lowland catchments and provide a scientific basis for targeted pollution control in polder waters.

The aim of this study was to describe bacterial diversity and antimicrobial resistance carriage from choanal clefts of DPs and GWPs, to elucidate differences between the two species of pelicans and age groups. Fifty-two choanal swab samples were collected from 31 nestlings (N) (20 DP/11 GWP) late in the 2022 breeding season, and 21 adults (A) DPs (DP-A) in early 2023. Samples were seeded in general and chromogenic selective media. Isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by disk diffusion method for staphylococci/mammaliicocci, enterococci and Enterobacterales. A total of 248 non-repetitive isolates (46A/202N) were recovered, representing 39 bacterial species from 18 genera. A very high prevalence of S. aureus (80.8 % of samples tested) was detected in both age groups (85.7 %A/77.4 %N), with nestlings also showing greater staphylococcal/ mammaliicoccal diversity. Most isolates recovered were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested, and none S. aureus was methicillin-resistant. Nevertheless, one multi-drug resistant (MDR) CTX-M-15-producing E. coliST69 isolate was found in one DP-A. This study revealed a high rate of antimicrobial susceptibility and staphylococcal/mammaliicoccal diversity in choanal samples of pelicans, with the occasional detection of MDR isolates of concern, like the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli strain.

The geoarchaeological research conducted at site FV92, located at the Luulityn Toirom Paleolake, provides insight into the problem of human relations with the changing environment of the Early Holocene, as well as the problem of the site formation process in the Gobi area. Sedimentological studies and luminescence dating of the Luulityn Toirom Lake sediments indicate the presence of the lake and favorable environmental conditions for human settlement in the Early Holocene in the period before 8130 +/- 83 BP. Spatial analyses of the artifact distribution, as well as refitting studies of the discovered lithic assemblage, enabled the determination of the site's formation process. Initially, the site was influenced by fluvial processes, but as the climate dried, it was subsequently affected by aeolian processes. The techno-typological analysis, refitting studies, and microscopic analyses carried out provide the first such detailed insight into the technological behavior and identification of the cha & icirc;ne op & eacute;ratoire used by the Early Holocene hunter-gatherer communities of the Gobi area. The results confirmed that the lithic technology was mainly based on microblade technology. Microscopic analyses of traces created during tool use indicate butchery activity and the use of plant resources. The studies indicate a high degree of mobility of hunter-gatherer communities living by the lakes, as evidenced by the medium-range transport of raw material brought to the campsite from the surrounding mountainous Altai area.

Carbon dioxide emissions across contrasting urban freshwater ecosystems	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from freshwaters represent a globally important carbon flux. However, CO2 fluxes from urban waters remain poorly constrained, and challenges remain for reliable upscaling, partly because of the high diversity of urban aquatic ecosystems. Using floating chambers to measure fluxes instantaneously and monitor them over multiple days, we estimated CO2 emissions at 31 sites (lakes, ponds, rivers and streams) across the city of Berlin in four seasons. We evaluated land cover, nutrient concentrations, dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, and chlorophyll-a and micropollutant concentrations as potential drivers of CO2 emissions. CO2 fluxes from lakes and ponds averaged 0.41 g C m-2d-1 (ranging from -0.45 to 3.38 across sites and methods), aligning with the results of previous studies. CO2 fluxes from our urban rivers and streams averaging 0.78 g C m-2d-1 (range from -0.13 to 7.32) were lower than typically reported for running waters, conceivably due to limited gas exchange in the channelized lowland systems. CO2 fluxes were positively associated with DOM aromaticity, pointing to allochthonous inputs delivering resources for respiration, whether from (treated) wastewater or sealed urban surfaces. Fluxes were lower and more variable in settings favoring primary production, suggesting an impact of CO2 drawdown. This condition coincided with a higher percentage of paved area. Extrapolation to the entire aquatic network of the city yielded an annual emission estimate of 8.8 Gg C-CO2. An implication of this study is that urban lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams should be recognized as distinct systems when establishing large-scale CO2 emission budgets.

Celestine Lake produces authigenic carbonate in its shallow waters while preserving organic sediments in the deeper basin. Sedimentary analysis of three cores collected from Celestine Lake along a shallow- to deep-water transect, analysis of modern lake water geochemistry, and surface sediment characteristics provide a model for interpreting downcore changes in carbonate and organic matter content in the context of prolonged shifts in water level. The modern thermocline at 420-550 cm below water level matches the transition from shallow-water carbonates to deep-water organic sediment. Shallow-water carbonates are almost absent in the mid-depth core from 7-2 ka BP, suggesting a 1-2 m higher lake level during this period than from 11-7 ka BP and 2 ka BP-present when carbonate sediments dominate. Concurrent shifts in carbonate mineralogy and a similar to 5 parts per thousand increase in delta O-18(CaCO3) indicate the erosion of detrital dolomite into the lake driven by the wetter conditions. Comparison to similar to 50 lake records across the North American Rocky Mountain region suggests that the middle Holocene wetness may have resulted from a northward shift in the westerly jet stream that increased the seasonality of precipitation and left the northern United States dry. The Celestine Lake dataset combines sedimentological analysis, stable isotopes, water geochemistry, and mineralogy to produce a record of significant and sustained lake level increases from 7-2 ka BP in the Canadian Rockies in response to large scale hydroclimate shifts.

In this study, 11 Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP245 and SSP585) were used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool Plus (SWAT+) model. Streamflow projections were made for two future periods: the 2040s (2021-2060) and the 2080s (2061-2100). To correct for systematic biases in the GCM outputs, we applied the Delta Change method, which significantly reduced root mean square error (RMSE) in both precipitation and temperature by 3-35%, thereby improving the accuracy of SWAT+ simulations. To better capture inter-model variability and enhance the robustness of streamflow projections, we used the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) technique to generate a weighted ensemble, which outperformed the simple arithmetic mean by reducing uncertainty across models. Our results indicated that under SSP245, greater increases were projected in annual streamflow as well as in wet and normal-flow seasons (e.g., streamflow in normal-flow season in the 2080s increased by 13.0% under SSP245, compared to 7.0% under SSP585). However, SSP585 produced a much larger relative amplification in the dry season, with percentage changes relative to the historical baseline reaching up to +171.7% in the 2080s, although the corresponding absolute increases remained limited due to the low baseline flow. These findings quantify climate-driven hydrological changes in a cool temperate lake basin by integrating climate projections, hydrological modeling, and ensemble techniques, and highlight their implications for understanding hydrological sustainability under future climate scenarios, providing a critical scientific foundation for developing adaptive, cross-border water management strategies, and for further studies on water resource resilience in transboundary basins.					, Ping/ACH-8897-2022	, Ping/0000-0003-2481-9953														2071-1050				SEP 2	2025	17	17							7901	10.3390/su17177901	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17177901													WOS:001570098500001

The land use land cover (LULC), Cyperus papyrus biomass, and surface water dynamics were used to assess the ecological conditions of the study swamps. Landsat images were the source of data for LULC and vegetation biomass dynamics, and the Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) was the source of data for surface water dynamics analysis. These datasets were primarily analyzed using GIS, Google Earth Engine (GEE), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Besides, the Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to examine the relationship between vegetation biomass and climatic variables (precipitation and temperature). The findings indicate that the ecology of the papyrus swamps and mixed wetlands has been degraded. The substantial area of papyrus swamps (7.95 %) and mixed vegetation wetlands (56.44 %) have been lost in the past 35 years. The NDVI analysis also revealed the declining of the Cyperus papyrus and other macrophytes biomass. Besides, a significant part of the permanent surface water was either lost or changed to seasonal water surface. The results show that extensive farmland expansion contributed to the shrinkage of the swamps' area coverage and decline of macrophytes biomass. The filling of swamps by sediments and delta expansion also resulted in vegetation loss and created fertile ground for cultivation. The strong correlation (R = 0.373, P = 0.027) between vegetation biomass and precipitation also indicating the effect of climate on the Cyperus papyrus biomass. The considerable shrinkage of the swamps' coverage and the decreasing trends of Cyperus papyrus biomass will have implications on local people's livelihood, local climate regulation, carbon emission, Lake Tana water level and pollution, and aquatic biodiversity. Thus, sustainable wetland management measures are needed to reverse the ecological degradation of the swamps.

Effects of food quantity and quality on the life history of Daphnia lumholtzi in Mwanza Gulf (Lake Victoria, Tanzania)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Until the 1950s, large-bodied calanoids and cladocerans dominated the zooplankton community of Lake Victoria, whereas cyclopoid copepods only comprised 10% of microcrustaceans. From the 1960's onwards, cyclopoid copepods increased to 70-90% of zooplankton and cladocerans, now dominated by small species, decreased to ca. 5%. Concomitantly phytoplankton biomass increased and shifted from dominance of diatoms to Cyanobacteria, which were hypothesized to be of less nutritional quality, causing the shift in zooplankton. We investigated whether the natural assemblage of Cyanobacteria in Mwanza Gulf negatively affected growth and fecundity of cladocerans. In 2010-2011, we performed life-history experiments with the cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi, feeding it natural seston from Mwanza Gulf from three different locations. A laboratory-strain of the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus, proven to be high-quality food, was used as a control. Growth of D. lumholtzi in the rainy season and at one station in the dry season was just as high as in the control treatment. If there were negative effects of natural seston these were small. Although the evidence is circumstantial, this suggests that Cyanobacteria and/or their detritus could have been better food than expected and that food quality is not limiting the growth of D. lumholtzi in L. Victoria.

The primary objective is to generate daily spatial temperature fields using spatio-temporal kriging and subsequently compute evaporation using a calibrated Hargreaves-Samani (HS) model. We utilize daily data from the years 2020-2022, collected from six low-cost microstations installed around the lake and from a nearby professional meteorological station (Kopisty, operated by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute). Due to frequent outages, data coverage from the microstations ranges from 5% to 38%. To fill in missing values and estimate temperature over the lake surface, we apply a Gneiting covariance model. All computations are carried out in MATLAB using a in-house implementation. The reconstructed temperature fields exhibit realistic spatial structure and seasonal variability. Based on the interpolated daily mean, maximum, and minimum air temperatures, we compute daily and cumulative evaporation from the lake surface. The results show that even a sparse and unreliable sensor network can yield physically consistent inputs for evaporation estimation when combined with statistical interpolation. The proposed method is readily applicable to other reservoirs under limited measurement conditions and may support hydrological modeling and water balance analysis.

However, effective guidance for managing eutrophication in river-connected lakes is difficult to implement because of the complexity of hydrological systems. In this study, the dynamic relationship between nutrients and Chl a, as well as their responses and mechanisms to driving factors under varying hydrological conditions, were investigated using an 18-year dataset from a large river-connected lake (Dongting Lake). Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were higher during the dry season than during the flood season. In contrast, Chl a concentration decreased significantly from 3.17 mu g/L in the flood season to 2.61 mu g/L in the dry season, exhibiting an asynchronous response of Chl a to nutrient concentrations. The trophic state of Dongting Lake was borderline between mesotrophic and eutrophic, with a trophic state index (TSI) ranging from 49.96 to 51.08 across hydrological seasons. Chl a concentration increased significantly with increasing TN and decreasing TP. Dongting Lake was classified as either oligo-mesotrophic or eutrophic for TN concentrations of <= 1.29 mg/L and > 1.48 mg/L, respectively, during the dry season. The trophic state of Chl a was influenced by the combined limitation of N and P, with the strength of N limitation for oligo-mesotrophic conditions (Chl a) increasing to 13.89 % during the dry season. Hydrometeorological factors, such as water level and water temperature, significantly influenced the trophic state of Chl a during different hydrological seasons. Our findings indicate that the trophic state of Dongting Lake is highly responsive to hydrological variations, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the nutrient-Chl a relationship and hydrological conditions in policymaking, management planning, and ecological engineering efforts, which are crucial for improving water quality in river-connected lakes.

Pilar			Macroinvertebrates as Bioindicators of Aquaculture Impact on the Water Quality of Lake Guamuez, Narino, Colombia	REVISTA MVZ CORDOBA												Objective. This study aimed to evaluate the composition and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of water quality in three trout farms located in the Lake Guamuez basin, Nari & ntilde;o, Colombia. Materials and Methods. Sampling was conducted during both high and low precipitation periods in 2021. Benthic organisms were collected using a Van Veen grab with a 0.5 mm mesh at six sites: three located in aquaculture production zones and three in control sites. Diversity indices (Shannon-Weaver, Margalef, Berger-Parker, and Pielou), as well as the BMWP-Col index, were calculated. Statistical differences between zones and seasons were evaluated using ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests. Results. A total of 1780 individuals belonging to seven families were identified. Chironomidae was the dominant group in the aquaculture zones. Diversity indices showed significantly lower values at the trout farm sites compared to control sites (p<0.05), indicating reduced richness and evenness, along with increased dominance of tolerant taxa. No significant seasonal differences were observed. Conclusions. The study demonstrates that intensive aquaculture exerts measurable impacts on the benthic macroinvertebrate community, reducing its diversity and favoring tolerant species such as Chironomidae. These findings underscore the need for implementing environmental monitoring and management strategies to mitigate potential ecological degradation in high-Andean lakes.																			0122-0268	1909-0544				SEP-DEC	2025	30	3							e3758	10.21897/rmvz.3758	http://dx.doi.org/10.21897/rmvz.3758													WOS:001587838300002

Climate change, sea-level rise, and land subsidence have contributed to tidal flooding, which the embankment aims to mitigate. However, this construction may also affect water quality, influencing primary productivity and the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. Measurements of TSS nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (PO(4)3(-)), and chlorophyll-a, and water quality indicators (temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen [DO]) were conducted across four river estuaries: Banger, Loji, Sengkarang, and Bedahan. Hydrodynamic modeling and geospatial interpolation were used to analyze spatial changes and identify correlations between oceanographic factors, currents, tides, and seasonal variability. The results revealed significant seasonal variations, with hydrodynamic shifts linked to altered nutrient distribution and sediment accumulation. These findings highlight the importance of wastewater management and coastal adaptation strategies to address pollution risks and ensure sustainable environmental management in the region.

Based on daily meteorological and hydrological data from 1960 to 2016, this study investigated trends in extreme climate indices and assessed their impacts on runoff, evapotranspiration, water level, and water storage. Results revealed that annual extreme precipitation (R95pTOT) increased by approximately 1.25 mm yr-1, while the frequency of extremely warm days (TX90P) increased by 0.5 days yr-1 and extremely cold days (TN10P) decreased by 0.4 days yr-1. These shifts significantly influenced the basin's hydrology. Notably, runoff increased after a change point in 2004, closely related to higher RX5day values. Evapotranspiration exhibited a strong positive correlation with the growing season length (GSL), indicating temperature-driven moisture loss. In contrast, water level showed high interannual variability and was more closely related to annual total precipitation rather than extremes. Although water storage increased slightly, it fluctuated greatly due to the combined effects of warming-induced evapotranspiration and precipitation variability. These findings quantitatively demonstrate that extreme climate events have exerted nonlinear and seasonally asynchronous impacts on hydrological processes in the Qinghai Lake Basin, highlighting the need for basin-scale climate resilience strategies.

J	Major, V; Svarcova, V; Hendrychova, M; Vondrakova, L				Major, Vladimir; Svarcova, Viviana; Hendrychova, Marketa; Vondrakova, Lucie			Water quality of reclaimed lakes in post-mining locations of Czech Republic	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Post-mining lakes in the Czech Republic, especially in North Bohemia, represent distinctive opportunities for ecological transformation of degraded landscapes. Such lakes form in closed open-pit mines, where they create new water and wetland habitats. The ecological development of such systems is strongly affected by water quality, which is often impaired by residual contamination from mining and nutrient imbalances. Investigating the water quality is therefore essential for understanding the ecological potential, implementation of restoration strategies, and for evaluation of environmental risks to ensure further safe human and ecological use. This study explores the water quality of four post-mining lakes in the Czech Republic-Medard, Milada, Most, and Barbora. It focuses on biological indicators (microbial and plankton diversity) and water chemistry. The aim was to assess whether the current properties meet environmental standards, potentially supporting their use beyond recreation, such as for agricultural irrigation, drinking, or other practical purposes.

Therefore, environmental flow assessment with Nature-based solutions is an important issue to preserve and restore the river and lake ecosystems. This study compares conventional hydrological methods, and habitat simulation approaches with regard to the habitat suitability of native cyprinid fish species of the Beshar River located in the southwest of Iran. The results showed the highest agreement between physical habitat simulation (PHS) with Tennant method Optimum range (60-100 % of MAF) and Outstanding (60 % of MAF) for high water season and 40 % of MAF for low water season) classes for the hydrometry stations in this area. Whereas, Fair or degrading class of Tennant method officially suggested by Iran's Ministry of Energy for downstream of reservoir dams does not meet desired habitat of target fish species. Moreover, the high water and low water seasons of Tennant method will be matched with spawning of adult and growth stages (larval, fry and juvenile) of target cyprinid species in this arid region. The results show that the Good class of Tennant method is the most compatible with minimum environmental flow based on PHS for three cyprinids target species for the Beshar River. This hybrid approach to estimate environmental flow based on both simple hydrologic methods and habitat requirements perspectives of native species are recommended for semi-arid regions of developing countries under human regulation of the riverine systems by dam construction.

Trends and seasonal variation in gastrointestinal infections in Tanzania: Analysis of 5-year DHIS2 data toward implementing the sampling cycles and metagenomic analyses	IJID REGIONS												Objectives: Gastrointestinal (GI) infections, such as diarrhea and dysentery, continue to be major contributors of morbidity and mortality in low-resource countries. Determining trends and seasonality of GI infections provides a better understanding of how interventions can be improved to reduce the burden. To this effect, an analysis of data from the District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) was conducted to determine the trend and seasonal variations of GI infections in regions located in the Great Lakes of Tanzania. Methods: Data from DHIS2 of 22 districts in Tanzania recorded between January 2018 and December 2022 were analyzed for trends and seasonal variations in GI infections. The data were managed and analyzed by STATA and Microsoft Excel. Results: A total of 1,511,623 GI cases were recorded between January 2018 and December 2022, with diarrhea leading by 84.4%. Data have shown clear seasonal variations of GI infection: peaks during the rainy season and decline in the dry season. Conclusion: Results have revealed that there is a significant decrease in GI infections from January to August, and the cases increase from September to December. This confirmed two sampling cycles, the dry and rainy season, within which pathogen characteristics and diversity will be elucidated.

Evaluation of crop growth simulation by use of satellite rainfall estimates in Lake Victoria basin	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Crop growth simulations often rely on rainfall data from in-situ rain gauges, but limited access to quality gauged data in many regions necessitates the use of satellite rainfall estimates (SREs). However, SREs are affected by estimation errors that can propagate into crop growth simulations. Improving the reliability of SREs data sources by reducing the rainfall estimation errors can bring crop simulation results closer to simulations that rely on in-situ rainfall. This study assesses the effectiveness of a weighted ensemble (WEsc) of bias and random error corrected SREs in simulating maize biomass using the AquaCrop-OSPy model. Biomass estimates based on WEsc were compared with those simulated using: (i) four uncorrected SREs sources (CHIRPS, CMORPH, MSWEP, and RFE2), (ii) an arithmetic mean-based ensemble of uncorrected SREs data (AEs), and (iii) gauged rainfall as reference across six cropping seasons (2012-2017) in the Lake Victoria basin, Kenya. WEsc consistently outperformed individual SREs and AEs, closely matching biomass estimates obtained using gauged rainfall. WEsc also better represented crop failure events and showed potential for biomass estimation in ungauged areas. These results advocate for using ensemble estimates of bias and random error corrected SREs sources in agrohydrological applications, particularly where rain gauge data is limited.					; Booij, Martijn/C-7753-2011	Nelson, Andrew/0000-0002-7249-3778; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				SEP 1	2025	318								109731	10.1016/j.agwat.2025.109731	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2025.109731													WOS:001552200500001

Flamingo populations, particularly the greater and lesser species, are increasingly threatened by climate change, habitat degradation, and anthropogenic activities. Environmental indices such as Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and Surface algal bloom index (SABI), along with bioclimatic variables, were used to model habitat suitability in 2021 and project conditions for 2050 and 2070. Results showed that areas classified as highly suitable habitats decreased drastically from 12 % in 2021 to 0 % by 2070, while unsuitable areas rose from 37.5 % to 95.6 %, signalling a severe habitat contraction. The Area Under Curve (AUC) model achieved a high accuracy of (AUCtrain = 0.91; AUCtest = 0.85), with temperature seasonality (30 %) and precipitation in the driest quarter (15.1 %) emerging as key predictors. Remote sensing revealed that declining algal concentrations and water availability negatively impact flamingo food sources. Ongoing land-use changes, illegal salt pan encroachments, and unsustainable water extraction have further fragmented the habitat, leading to trophic disruptions. The projected future habitat loss aligns with regional and global patterns of wetland degradation. This study highlights the urgent need for integrated conservation strategies, regulatory enforcement, and restoration efforts to ensure the long-term survival of flamingos and the ecological integrity of Sambhar lake.

We combined water level observations, structural geology, hydrogeochemical data, stable isotopes, with statistical analysis and mixing models to investigate groundwater flow dynamics and geochemical evolution in the system. Three distinct groundwater flow trajectory groups were identified: Local, Intermediate and Regional, each exhibiting unique hydrogeochemical characteristics. Local flow paths were characterised by recent recharge and limited geochemical alteration. Intermediate flow trajectories showed evidence of more evolved waters, often associated with faults and intensive groundwater extraction zones. Regional flows, linked to fault zones along the shoreline of Lake Cuitzeo, displayed higher contents of major ions, dissolved Sr2+, Li+ and higher water temperatures. The lakes reflected discharge from different groundwater sources. Lake P & aacute;tzcuaro is predominantly fed by local recharge, while Lake Cuitzeo receives a more complex mix of flow paths. Intensive groundwater extraction, especially during the dry season for avocado plantations, has significantly disrupted natural flow regimes and lowered groundwater and lake levels. Our findings highlight the importance of integrated water resource management that accounts for interactions between local, intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems. Our results are especially relevant for lake basins fed by groundwater, where informed management strategies are essential considering increasing water demand scenarios. Additionally, this study draws international attention to the environmental impacts of high-value crops like avocado farming on groundwater in arid and semi-arid peri-urban regions across the Americas.

As one of the principal measures for ecological restoration of irrigation-district lakes, ecological water replenishment projects have been widely implemented. However, given the inherent complexity of lacustrine systems, the efficacy of ecological water replenishment in enhancing water quality and hydrological exchange capacity remains scientifically contentious. This study utilizes the MIKE 21 model to develop a 2D hydrodynamic model based on measured data (2011-2021), evaluating both the water exchange capacity and its influencing factors for a large semi-arid irrigation district lake under ecological water replenishment conditions. Furthermore, a modified Comprehensive Water Quality Identification Index (WQI) was employed to evaluate the characteristics of water quality changes. The results indicate that: (1) Over the 11-year period, the water renewal cycle shortened from 28-185 days to 25-115 days with increasing inflow to the lake. The water exchange capacity exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity. This was influenced by factors such as the location of the water replenishment inlet, lake topography, and aquatic vegetation. (2) As a typical artificially controlled lake in a semi-arid region, the continuous water replenishment rate over a specific time period determined the seasonal differences in water exchange rate. The variable inputs from multiple water sources led to varying water exchange rates among different years. (3) During the implementation of ecological water replenishment, the lake water quality improved significantly. Further integration of ecological water replenishment with point-source,non-point-source,and internal pollution control is necessary for the sustainable development of irrigation district lakes. Our study dynamically demonstrates the effects of external disturbances, such as ecological water replenishment projects, on the restoration and management of irrigation district lakes and provides theoretical and data support for sustainable management decision-making of artificially controlled lakes in irrigation districts.

Chlorophyll-a (Chla), a key indicator of algal biomass, is a widely recognized as a metric for eutrophication. However, existing remote sensing retrieval methods face limitations in addressing complex environmental variations. This study developed an innovative Dynamic Model Pool (DMP) framework to optimize water quality prediction performance dynamically. Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and monthly in-situ Chla measurement data from Erhai located in Southwest China spanning 2018 to 2020, this study tested the effectiveness of the DMP framework. The results demonstrated that: (1) The DMP framework dynamically selected the optimal model based on data-specific characteristics. In 2018, the CBR model achieved the highest accuracy, while in 2019, GBR and XGBR were the most accurate. In 2020, GBR outperformed other models. (2) Spatiotemporal Chla distribution maps recorded consistently higher concentrations in the south part of lake, while the central part showed minimal level and variation. (3) Seasonal precipitation and temperature variations and policy implementation were key drivers of Chla concentration changes. Seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature collectively influenced the nutrient input and dilution dynamics in Erhai. Meanwhile, policy interventions implemented between 2018 and 2022, such as pollution interception and wastewater treatment, substantially decreased nutrient inflows during flood seasons and effectively limited nutrient accumulation.

Successional stages and flooding disturbance influence seed and bud bank traits but have rarely been explored in floodplain wetlands. We investigated seed and bud banks species composition and density along a successional gradient from shallow water to Carex grassland in Shengjin Lake-a floodplain wetland of the Yangtze River in China-before (May 2023) and after (November 2023) flooding. The species richness of soil seed banks and species similarity with extant communities increased from shallow water to Carex grassland before and after flooding. The few species in bud banks were perennial macrophytes, namely, Carex thunbergii, Phalaris arundinacea, and Eleocharis valleculosa var. setosa. The density of soil seed banks increased from shallow water, mudflat, to Carex grassland (6980, 9438, and 18,140 seeds m-2, respectively) before flooding and significantly decreased after flooding (3174, 7608, and 10,439 seeds m-2, respectively). The density of the bud bank increased from shallow water, mudflat, to Carex grassland (0, 78, and 437 buds m-2, respectively) before flooding but significantly increased after flooding in shallow water and Carex grassland (16 and 1082 buds m-2, respectively). Our results indicated that both seed and bud banks increased across the successional gradient from shallow water to Carex grassland and responded differently to seasonal flooding except that bud banks in mudflat showed similar response trends. Therefore, vegetation restoration in floodplain wetlands should consider the interplay between seed and bud banks, successional stage, and flooding disturbance.

However, it remains limited to understand soil water movement and plant water uptake in wetland ecosystems under changing moisture conditions. Here, we analyzed stable isotopic variations of precipitation, soil water and plant water in a typical flood wetland in Poyang Lake from December 2020 to May 2021. A progressive enrichment of the delta H-2 and delta O-18 values existed from soil water to plant stem and leaf water. The importance of considering the precipitation isotopic time-scale was emphasized when interpreting seasonal soil water isotopes in the flood wetlands. The temporal isotopic fluctuations in shallow soil water (0 similar to 40 cm) were more pronounced, and frequent abrupt isotopic enrichment of subsurface layers was attributed to the ubiquitous preferential flow. The vertical isotopic distributions of deep soil water (40 similar to 150 cm) exhibited two distinct patterns: stable isotopes remained relatively constant, and showed a gradual depletion trend with increasing depths, which were related to the infiltration depth of precipitation in the form of translatory flow. There were significant monthly variations in water uptake from shallow soil layers by dominant plants based on the MixSIAR model, with the highest and lowest values of similar to 94 % (December) and similar to 47 % (May), respectively. A definite shift in water use strategies from multi-source combinations towards increased dependence on precipitation was revealed from the dry to wet conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of ecohydrological processes in Poyang Lake wetland, and provide a scientific basis for improving water resources management aiming at sustainable development of regional ecosystem service functions.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2025	178								114021	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114021													WOS:001581105800001

However, few studies have quantitatively analyzed water quality changes in eutrophic lakes under water division considering the effects of internal and external nutrient load. Chaohu Lake, a large shallow lake in East China, was used as an example. Daily meteorological, hydrological, and water quality data for 2023-2024 were applied to develop a coupled hydrodynamic-water quality model using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code, considering seasonal sediment release of ammonia, phosphate, and nitrate. Based on this model, the seasonal contributions to nutrient loads from internal and external sources were quantified. Water transfer scenarios were employed to simulate and compare the spatial and temporal changes in the water level and water quality of Chaohu Lake. The results demonstrated that: 1) The simulated values of the water level, water temperature, and water quality parameters (including TN, TP, and DO) fit well with the measured values, thus confirming the reliability of the model. 2) The annual endogenous release of phosphorus and nitrogen accounted for 76.8 % and 75.3 % of the total load from internal and external sources, respectively. 3) Water transfer measures significantly altered the hydrological conditions of the lake, exacerbated seasonal fluctuations in nutrients, and increased sediment release, leading to an increase in TP concentration, and decrease of TN and DO. Under the four water transfer scenarios, the water transfer path of diverting water into Chaohu Lake (150 m3/s) through Zhao River and using the Baishitian River as the outlet significantly improved the water quality of the entire lake, with 5.03 % decrease in TN concentration and a minimum increase (14.29 %) of TP. This study provides a scientific basis for water diversion scheduling and eutrophication regulation in lakes.

Fish composition in a complex freshwater estuary: Environmental DNA metabarcoding versus capture surveys	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective The potential for environmental DNA (eDNA) to disperse widely from source organisms enables high detection efficiency but raises questions about eDNA's ability to differentiate fine-scale spatial patterns relative to conventional fish capture data.Methods We evaluate these questions in the St. Louis River estuary-a hydrologically and spatially complex coastal system within Lake Superior that supports a diverse assemblage of resident and migratory fish species-via comparison of eDNA metabarcoding (12S and 16S loci) to multigear capture survey data from 2 years and two seasons.Results The eDNA and capture surveys collectively yielded 68 fish species: 2 species detected only by capture, 27 detected only by eDNA, and 39 shared across both survey types but having generally higher occurrence frequencies with eDNA than capture. Six species detected only by eDNA were unexpected, having no prior records in the Lake Superior basin. Data from paired eDNA and capture stations showed little relationship between the two survey types, with capture yielding species at stations that eDNA did not, eDNA detecting species in different habitats and distant locations from any captures, and assemblage patterns homogenized in eDNA surveys relative to capture surveys.Conclusions Our study finds that eDNA is a sensitive tool for assessing species presence at the system scale but that capture surveys may better yield the fine-scale spatial distribution information of interest to fisheries and habitat managers, especially in spatially and hydrologically complex systems. Our study confirms broader detectability of fish with environmental DNA surveys than with capture surveys in an open coastal ecosystem but also finds that environmental DNA data lack the specificity of capture data for fish spatial distribution and habitat usage. The two survey approaches offer complementary but not redundant information.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				2025 SEP 1	2025										10.1093/tafafs/vnaf036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/tafafs/vnaf036		SEP 2025											WOS:001561119000001

Wastewater effluent can travel through the water column as a well-defined plume, owing to density differences. This study evaluated the complex effects of drought on plume behavior and water quality in Lake Mead, an arid reservoir in the southwestern United States, using a hydrodynamic model, and compared its performance to a simpler machine learning model. Water quality remained high despite lake elevation declines if in-and outflow rates were maintained. DFR fluctuated seasonally following the plume entrainment depth in the lake thermal structure, with decreased lake elevation shifting peak DFR to occur earlier in the year. Though the hydrodynamic model (relative root mean square error (RRMSE) = 6.7 %) slightly outperformed the machine learning model (RRMSE = 10.8 %), both models can aid treatment and management decisions by predicting DFR at (drinking) water infrastructure.

To investigate these changes, this study selected six NPs and examined shifts in spatial visitation patterns and their relationship with proximity to park facilities before and during the pandemic. Based on 48,041 geotagged Flickr photos from 2018 to 2023, we employed the Seasonal Concentration Index (SCI), Geographic Concentration Index (GCI), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and the Optimal Parameter-based Geographic Detector (OPGD). Temporally, all six NPs experienced a pronounced drop in visitor numbers in 2020-2021, with only partial recovery by 2023. Spatially, visitor distribution remained highly uneven, with hotspots clustered around Banff, Jasper, and Lake Louise. However, a gradual dispersion of visitor flow toward less-developed and lower-density areas was observed in recent years. Importantly, COVID-19 shifted visitors' spatial preferences: proximity to natural features such as rivers became more influential than the traditional pull of accommodations and services. These findings suggest a pandemic-induced reconfiguration of tourism behaviour, favouring more dispersed and nature-oriented experiences, though not necessarily closer to forest interiors. The study underscores the need for adaptive tourism planning that aligns with changing recreational demands and the ecological character of NPs.					dou, Yaquan/MVT-5708-2025															2666-7193				SEP	2025	21								100966	10.1016/j.tfp.2025.100966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tfp.2025.100966													WOS:001545091500001

Focusing on Microcystis blooms dynamics in Dianchi Lake (China), our approach uniquely integrates causal inference with time-series embedding, reconstructing the ecosystem's hidden dynamics in a higher-dimensional geometric space. This foundation enables us to rigorously quantify causal drivers-such as nutrient loading and temperature-while overcoming the limitations of traditional correlation-based analyses. Our causal network analysis reveals distinct nonlinear responses of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and Microcystis density to different nutrient drivers. Specifically, we found that in-lake total phosphorus (TP) exerts a stronger causal influence on overall algal dynamics than total nitrogen (TN). In contrast, external nutrient loading shows greater influence over Microcystis density compared to in-lake nutrients. Through scenario simulations, we further demonstrate that rising air temperatures amplify Chl-a concentration and Microcystis biomass through increased water temperatures, whereas precipitation-induced nutrient changes preferentially stimulate Chl-a production over Microcystis growth. Notably, we identified contrasting seasonal response patterns, with Chl-a exhibiting greater sensitivity to dry-season conditions while Microcystis density responded more strongly to wet-season drivers. By bridging mechanistic understanding and predictive modeling, our work offers a transformative tool for forecasting and managing CyanoHABs in changing climates.

Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of these lakes is essential for deciphering regional hydrological cycles and predicting their ecological evolution in water-stressed environments. Leveraging the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, we mapped the monthly water extents of lakes in the HSDK (2017-2022) at 10 m spatial resolution and analyzed their drivers. Key findings include: (1) Three classification approaches - pixel-based random forest (RF), object-oriented random forest (OB-RF), and support vector machine (SVM) - achieved high accuracy (Overall Accuracy: 98.5 %, 97.4 %, and 98.4 %; Kappa Coefficients: 0.970, 0.946, and 0.967, respectively). Compared with seasonal lakes, permanent lakes exhibited superior extraction accuracy. Notably, the OB-RF method generated clustered artifacts when mapping small fragmented water bodies. (2) The annual maximum lake area in the HSDK fluctuated between 345.61 and 419.42 km(2) 2017-2022 (mean: 379.55 km(2)). Though seasonal lakes were more numerous, permanent lakes made up 70 % of the total area. Monthly variations revealed a three-phase pattern: a gradual decline from April to June, a marked expansion in July-September, and subsequent contraction in October. (3) Interannual lake area changes were positively correlated with precipitation (2017-2021, R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.05), although anomalous expansion occurred in 2022 despite reduced rainfall, suggesting hydrological inertia. At the monthly scale, lake areas exhibited a significant one-month lagged response to precipitation (R-2 = 0.61, p < 0.001), highlighting delayed hydrological feedback.

This study developed a novel framework to map PRCP across China with a refining phenological feature-based method. Specifically, we enhanced the identification of paddy field areas and introduced a simplified approach to derive CIPR and cropping calendar, establishing an integrated framework for comprehensive PRCP detection. The framework was validated through 2,977 ground samples and national agricultural statistics, demonstrating strong applicability at regional scales and effectively extracted PRCP. Key ecological findings are outlined below: (1) While the national paddy area remained stable, its centroid shifted northeastward (though the post-2015 migration rate declined by 96 %), driven by contraction in southern China (-0.47 kha/yr pre-2015) offset by northern expansion (+0.52 kha/yr) linked to urbanization, water scarcity, and climate adaptation. Over 75 % of paddies remained concentrated below 200 m elevation, yet high-altitude cultivation (>700 m) emerged notably in Inner Mongolia due to technological advances. (2) Double-cropping areas declined by 0.27 kha/yr (2000-2011), especially in major lake basins and southern coastal regions, associated with labor shortages and economic pressures, while single-cropping stabilized post-2012, reflecting adaptations to resource constraints. (3) Latitudinal gradients delayed first-season transplanting and harvesting by 0.77 days/yr, primarily due to CIPR reduction, whereas second-season dates remained stable within their southern confines (<28 degrees N). The FSe framework provides a robust indicator system for agroecosystem sustainability assessment. The observed CIPR reduction, phenological delays, and spatial migration highlight adaptive responses to climate and socioeconomic pressures. This work establishes a transferable model for global rice monitoring, informing critical policies on water conservation, methane mitigation, and climate-resilient agriculture.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2025	178								114068	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114068													WOS:001560734300001
J	Worako, AW				Worako, Adimasu Woldesenbet			Characterization of hydrological drought conditions in Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes Basin	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												Drought is a disastrous natural phenomenon that causes social, economic, environmental and political crisis to a given region due to water scarcity. This study presents the hydrological drought characteristics in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes Basin by using streamflow drought index (SDI). The streamflow data were collected from 18 stations from Ministry of Water and Energy (MoWE) of Ethiopia. The SDI value was computed by employing the drought index calculator (DrinC) software and the trend of hydrological drought for three periods (SDI-3, SDI-6 and SDI-12) was detected by applying the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope method. The findings of the study indicate that there was no significant trend on a seasonal basis, whereas there was significant increasing and decreasing trends on biannual and annual bases in Kulfo, Tikurwuha, Kola and Katar stations. The most common severe hydrological drought periods in the basin were 1984, 1985, 1999 and 2002 and the most common extreme drought registered years were 1984, 1986, 1991 and 2002. The probability of drought occurrence varies from catchment to catchment and timescales used. Hence, this study may provide basic information about the hydrological conditions that helps to develop better water adaptation and mitigation strategies in the basin.																			2040-2244	2408-9354				SEP	2025	16	9					2726	2741		10.2166/wcc.2025.832	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2025.832													WOS:001585511500001
J	Yang, DZ; Liu, YQ				Yang, Dazhi; Liu, Yaqun			Heterogeneous impacts of human activities and climate change on transformed vegetation dynamics on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In the context of intensifying global environmental change, elucidating vegetation dynamics and their driving mechanisms is vital for sustainable ecosystem management. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a region known for its sensitivity and vulnerability, exhibits a high degree of responsiveness to climate change and human activities. The region's pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity renders it an optimal area for investigating vegetation changes and their driving mechanisms. However, existing research predominantly emphasizes natural factors, with insufficient systematic analysis of human activities, thereby constraining a comprehensive understanding of driving mechanisms. This study utilizes MODIS NDVI data to systematically analyze GNDVI (the average NDVI during the growing season) trends and their driving mechanisms across the QTP from 2000 to 2018, integrating natural factors (temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow depth, elevation, slope) and human factors (roads, population, grazing intensity) from multi-scale and vegetation-type perspectives. Results reveal a significant increasing trend in GNDVI (p < 0.05) across the QTP, with pronounced improvements in the northeast and degradation in specific regions of the southwest and southeast. From 2000 to 2018, 79.19% of QTP vegetation exhibited improvement (39.52% significantly), while 14.28% experienced degradation (2.78% significantly). During the study period, the QTP climate exhibited a warming and moistening trend, which generally benefited vegetation growth. The impacts of natural and human factors on vegetation changes vary significantly across different spatial regions. Population density and grazing intensity have obvious threshold effects on vegetation dynamics: when population density exceeds 17 pop/km2, their effects on vegetation change rate approach marginal effects, while grazing intensity exceeds 250 SU/km2, resulting in a significant decrease in GNDVI change rate. Notably, grazing and tourism activities near roads and lakes negatively impacted GNDVI in the southwest and southeast, partially offsetting the positive effects of climate change and contributing to degradation. Based on these findings, the study recommends establishing a long-term investment mechanism for ecosystem protection, implementing differentiated regional management strategies, and enhancing regulatory oversight of human activities. Specifically, strict controls on grazing and tourism development in ecologically sensitive areas are necessary to mitigate their impacts on fragile ecosystems. This study constructs a framework that integrates the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of natural and human factors, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. It advances the theoretical understanding of the driving mechanisms behind vegetation dynamics in alpine ecosystems and provides a scientific foundation for formulating differentiated ecological protection policies and sustainable management strategies.

J	Zhang, WQ; Zhang, DW; Jin, X; Shan, BQ				Zhang, Wenqiang; Zhang, Dianwei; Jin, Xin; Shan, Baoqing			Study on the water quality evolution mechanism of typical shallow lake based on in-depth mining of water quality indicators	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The water quality (WQ) of Baiyangdian Lake (BYDL), known as the 'kidney of North China', declined continuously for about four decades from the 1980s because of socioeconomic development. Since the Xiong'an New Area was established in 2017, remediation efforts have been implemented and the WQ has improved. In this study, we analyzed six years of WQ data from BYDL using ordinary least squares regression, time series analysis, and the Mann-Kendall trend test. The results reveal a marked improvement in WQ since 2018, with Class III accounting for over 60 % of observations. There were significant decreasing trends in chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, and Chlorophyll-a (p < 0.05) and an overall increasing trend in dissolved oxygen (p < 0.05). The WQ indicators varied seasonally. The WQ improvements generally aligned with the timing and patterns of the major engineering interventions but short-term fluctuations in the WQ indicators may have been caused by climatic variability. The findings highlight the complexity of the WQ pattens in BYDL and illustrate that the management strategy shifted from an initial phase that focused on pollution control to a second phase of ecological restoration integrated with environmental governance. This information can be used to refine future restoration strategies for BYDL and to guide sustainable management practices in similar shallow lake systems.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2025	178								113914	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113914													WOS:001555979200002
J	Evcil, GT; Sonmez, O; Baycan, A				Evcil, Gamze Tuncer; Sonmez, Osman; Baycan, Abdulkadir			Hydro-Meteorological shifts under climate change: A case study using CORDEX projections	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Climate change is profoundly affecting hydro-meteorological systems by altering precipitation patterns, temperature regimes and hydrological cycles. This study assesses these impacts in the Susurluk Basin, including the ecologically and hydrologically important and Ramsar-protected Uluabat Lake. Future climate projections for the period 2026-2100 were analyzed using the CORDEX_Adjust - which was developed under the framework of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) to enable more localized and accurate use of climate projection data- dataset under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model was preferred due to its capacity to simulate watershed processes in detail and its widespread use. The results reveal that (i) there is a significant increase in annual average precipitation and significant seasonal shifts across the basin and (ii) monthly average flows will increase significantly at Dolluk streamflow observation station, especially during the wet season (December-March). The flow increases are calculated as 144.7% in the RCP4.5 scenario and 108.9% in the RCP8.5 scenario. These rates represent the average flow change for the months of the rainy season only. These changes indicate that flood risk may increase, especially during periods of extreme precipitation, posing new challenges for regional water resources management and infrastructure resilience. (iii) This study demonstrates that the SWAT model is an effective tool for modeling hydrological responses to climate change and (iv) provides critical information for adaptation of dam operations, flood risk reduction and development of sustainable water management plans. Through the integration of high-resolution climate projections, the study emphasizes the need for proactive planning to address the impacts of climate change on water resources and provides valuable scientific guidance to policy makers and water managers for the Susurluk Basin and other similar basins.

We analyzed the concentrations of 26 potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the muscle, gills, and liver, and 18 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the muscle of roach originating from reservoirs (artificial lakes) with different uses (power generation and water supply) and anthropogenic impacts. Elemental concentrations were compared to maximum allowable concentrations and used to calculate pollution indices, including the metal pollution index and liver/muscle Hg index, health risk and benefit indices (target hazard quotient-THQ, target cancer risk-TR, Se:Hg, Na:K, and Ca:Mg ratios), and contributions of selected trace elements and macronutrients in roach meat. Additionally, the condition factor and histopathology were applied as biomarkers. The results showed that element accumulation varied between sites and tissues, with muscle tissue having the lowest pollution load and gills being the most exposed. OCP concentrations were below the maximum residue levels at all sites. Health risk and benefit indices determined no significant risks from the consumption of roach meat. The biomarker analysis showed diverse results with regard to pollutant accumulation. The highest anthropogenic pressure was observed in reservoirs used for power generation. Additionally, reservoirs at higher elevations were less polluted compared to reservoirs at lower elevations. Overall, the study suggests that the roach is a suitable bioindicator of environmental pollution.					; Raskovic, Bozidar/E-6523-2011; Tasić, Aleksandra/HMP-5375-2023; Krpo-Ćetković, Jasmina/M-8794-2019	Nikolic, Dusan/0000-0003-2004-1662; 													0269-4042	1573-2983				AUG 30	2025	47	10							420	10.1007/s10653-025-02729-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-025-02729-w								40883603					WOS:001563472700001

However, deep-seated bedrock landslides are usually located in steep and inaccessible mountain area, posing a significant challenge to their effective observation and failure warnings. In this study, we utilized optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping, and field investigation to analyze three closely located deep-seated bedrock landslides (Baige, Xiaomojiu, and Guili) at different evolution stages along the Jinsha river in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. We analyzed the geological structures of these landslides and conducted evolution analysis to explore the potential ability of remote sensing technology in failure warning of landslide. The results indicate that the three landslides are situated within the Jinsha suture zone and are composed of broken gneiss, serpentinite, and mylonit. The complex materials and structure resulted in differential deformation along the slope, manifested by varying density of tensile cracks, size of fractured zone, and cumulative displacements in different parts of the slope. In the 20 years before the 2018 Baige landslide event, the coverage area of fractured zone changes from 0.09 km2 to 0.38 km2, accounting for 43.6 % of the total landslide area. Deformation data from SAR images (2017-2021) reveal periodic patterns during landslide evolution, though the influence of seasonal flood level variations appears limited. The periodic deformation infers that deep-seated bedrock landslide failures may be related to precipitation infiltration and slope erosion. In conclusion, the evolution of deep-seated bedrock landslides is a prolonged surface process, and multi-source remote sensing provide effective solution for detecting surface damage and deformation at various stages of evolution.

Andrew			Tight lines: Algal bloom, anglers perception, and economic impact of recreational fishing - The case of lake Okeechobee, Florida	TOURISM ECONOMICS												Recreational fisheries are increasingly vulnerable to environmental degradation. Understanding the dynamics of nature-based recreation and the attendant tourism economy requires an integrative modeling framework that captures the interplay of seasonality, uncertainty, and users' response to ecological stressors. This study presents a model focusing on Lake Okeechobee-a recreational bass fishery in USA. Landuse activities surrounding the lake contribute to elevated nutrient levels, resulting in harmful algal blooms (HABs) that affect recreational activities. Using primary and secondary data and stochastic input-output model, the study quantifies tourism-related economic losses due to HABs. In 2019, recreational fishing generated about $369 million in economic output, supporting 2700 jobs and $122 million in earnings. Under less severe and extreme HAB scenarios, regional earnings could decline by 7.74% and 44.32%, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of understanding connections between environmental quality, system uncertainty, seasonality, user behavior, and economic impacts when planning for sustainable nature-based tourism.

I know what you ate last breeding season: anthropogenic food subsidies as a driver of the trophic ecology of nesting Kelp Gulls in a freshwater ecosystem in Patagonia, Argentina	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Gulls are opportunistic birds that take advantage of anthropogenic food subsidies, often leading to conflicts with human populations. In Argentina, the Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) is distributed along the Atlantic coast and in some freshwater environments. We evaluated the trophic ecology of a population nesting in Nahuel Huapi Lake, with access to anthropogenic food subsidies. We used complementary methodologies (pellets, stomach contents, stable isotopes) to determine their diet during the incubation and chick-rearing periods in 2019 and 2020, in two colonies (similar to 261 and 314 nests) located close to urban areas. Pellets showed a relatively high percentage of anthropogenic food resources (>40%) and terrestrial arthropod remains (>40%) in all breeding stages and years, except during incubation in 2019, when >70% of rodent remains were recorded. Stomach contents also showed a high percentage of garbage in both years (40-80% incubating adults, 30-40% chicks) and of terrestrial arthropods (30-60%). Isotopic niche width differed between years, and the isotopic composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of adult and chick red blood cells showed a significant proportion of terrestrial resource (natural and anthropogenic items combined) consumption in all stages and years and a lower proportion of garbage in 2019. This study shows the generalist and opportunistic habits of Kelp Gulls at the Nahuel Huapi Lake colonies, evidenced by the wide variety of food consumed and the ability to take advantage of the food that becomes available in the natural environment (e.g., rodent outbreak throughout 2019). This study of the trophic ecology of the Kelp Gulls in the Nahuel Huapi Lake provides essential baseline information for future assessments of the gulls' demographic behaviour and their role within the urban-lake-terrestrial ecosystem. Further studies to understand the use of resources during the non-breeding season are recommended.

Using a seasonal diversion project in a semi-enclosed bay as a case study, we analyzed phytoplankton composition via morphological methods and assessed carbon balance through simultaneous measurements of primary production (P), ecosystem respiration rate (R), and production-to-respiration (PP/R) ratio. Our results showed that artificial water diversion activities during the wet month enhanced hydrological connectivity and phytoplankton homogeneity, triggering a mixed diatom-dinoflagellate bloom. Phytoplankton abundance during the wet month increased by sevenfold (surface layer) and 26.5-fold (bottom layer) compared to dry month values. This simultaneously resulted in the PP value of the wet month being more than twice that of the dry month. Although R rose with increasing phytoplankton abundance, no significant correlation was observed between them. Instead, dry-month R was primarily driven by pH and dissolved organic carbon, whereas wet-month R showed minimal environmental linkages. PP/R ratios of surface and bottom layers were always less than 1, implying Meishan bay was a net heterotrophic ecosystem, despite significant changes in phytoplankton community structure induced by artificial water diversion and associated algal bloom. Furthermore, our results strongly suggest that changes in PP, but not in R, control the PP/R ratio of Meishan bay. This study offers valuable guidance for the ecological management of artificial water diversions and can serve as a reference for similar water diversion projects in other semi-enclosed bays.

While AGB levels vary significantly across different vegetation types and regions, the spatial distribution of AGB for specific wetland communities remains poorly characterized. To address this, we integrated field-collected data with Sentinel-2 spectral bands and remote sensing indices, employing random forest (RF) regression and Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) for AGB modeling. Through comparative evaluation of their inversion performance, the optimal model was selected to estimate vegetation AGB in the Nanji Wetland. By incorporating wetland classification data, we further generated spatial distribution maps of AGB for four dominant vegetation types during the dry season. The main findings are as follows. Important variables for the RF model included spectral bands B12, B11, B3, B2, B9, B1, B8, B6, and B4 and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (KNDVI), and Simple Ratio Index (SR). RF demonstrated significantly higher predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.945, RMSE = 109.205 g<middle dot>m-2) compared to the BPNN (R2 = 0.821, RMSE = 176.025 g<middle dot>m-2). The total estimated AGB reached 4.03 x 109 g; Carex spp. dominated AGB accumulation (1.49 x 109 g), followed by P. australis spp. (6.69 x 108 g), M. lutarioriparius spp. (4.60 x 108 g), and Polygonum spp. (3.61 x 108 g). The AGB exhibited a clear spatial gradient, decreasing from higher-elevation lakeshore areas towards the central lake. The results provide detailed spatial quantification of AGB stocks across dominant vegetation types, revealing distinct spatial characteristics and interspecies variations in AGB. This study offers a valuable baseline and methodological framework for monitoring wetland carbon dynamics.

However, none of the lakes in Bosnia and Herzegovina are regularly sampled or monitored, resulting in extremely scarce data and a largely unknown history of the lakes. We used a paleolimnological approach to identify and examine the main drivers of change in Lake Kotlanicko, located in the alpine tundra zone of the Zelengora Mountains in southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. We investigated changes in diatom assemblages using a 23-cm long sedimentary record and found a pronounced increase of planktonic diatoms (mainly Lindavia radiosa) relative to tychoplanktonic and benthic species since the 1960s. This change in diatom-assemblage composition is likely associated with stronger thermal stratification due to longer ice-free seasons induced by rising regional air temperatures. In addition, the more recent period (since 2002) covered by the sedimentary record is marked by the occurrence of the planktonic Asterionella formosa, a taxon commonly found in mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes. The longer inferred periods of thermal stratification, combined with increased nutrients as revealed by the diatoms, suggest shifts in lake habitat and that Lake Kotlaniko has undergone important changes over the last similar to 65 years.

Higher concentrations of these target contaminants were detected in the western part of the lake and during the wet season. No significant east-west differences in ARGs and microbiota across the three environmental matrices were found, whereas seasonal variations impacted lake water and IC more profoundly than sediments. Significant correlations be-tween microbiota and ARGs in the lake water and IC, while those in sediments showed weaker associations. Co-occurrence network analysis showed, among three environmental media, beta-lactam and multidrug-resistant genes were widespread found, and Proteobacteria were identified as a stable host. Non-antibiotic pollutants, such as amantadine and terbuthylazine, displayed significant positive correlations with ARGs, similar to sulfamethox-azole and clindamycin. Our findings highlight the important roles of seasonal hydrological changes and non-antibiotic pollutants in the dissemination of ARGs.

Given the importance of this ecosystem, we investigated methane (CH4) emissions from the limnetic zone and marginal soils in a drying lagoon in the Pantanal during a drought period unprecedented in over 75 years. To this end, CH4 flux measurements were conducted along a transect with three replicates in each of the evaluated compartments, with four samples collected per day during both a dry-season and a wet-season campaign (2019-2020). The highest emissions occurred during the drying event, primarily in the aquatic compartment (7.43 mg +/- 5.51 CH4 m(-)(2) day(-)(1), mean +/- SD, n = 20), representing a 56-fold increase in CH4 emissions compared to the wet season, and along the margins (3.43 +/- 3.55 mg CH4 m(-)(2) day(-)(1), n = 12). This indicates that the lowering of the water column and exposed sediments became a significant source of CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that these environments can become large CH4 emitters during drying events. Accordingly, current CH4 emission models underestimate their contribution due to neglecting sediment exposure effects. With the expected increase in drying events in the Pantanal, CH4 emissions will likely rise in the coming years, exacerbating global warming and intensifying climate change.

An indicator linking parameter concentrations to the river's flow rate was used to assess the development of the examined parameters. The analysis spanned from 2011 to 2022, considering both seasonal and yearly variations. Normal probability plots served as statistical tools to evaluate whether the data followed normal distributions and identify outliers. The proposed segmentation divided the Bahlui River into four segments, each defined by anthropogenic stressors. It was found that, due to human activity, each river segment could be viewed as an "independent" river. This supports the idea that river segments can be analyzed separately as distinct components. The proposed segmentation approach represents an alternative approach in river water quality research, moving from traditional continuous system models to fragmented system analysis, which better reflects the reality of heavily modified river systems. The study's findings are important for understanding how anthropogenic modifications affect river ecosystem functioning in the long term.

In response to this issue, China has implemented some ecological restoration measures in the Yangtze River basin to improve water quality, but the results of those measures on water transparency are unsure. This study integrates long-term Landsat satellite imagery with a machine learning model to estimate Secchi disk depth (Zsd), a critical indicator of lake transparency and ecological health. The model achieved an average absolute error of 13.4 cm, a root mean square error of 17.9 cm, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.712.From 2013 to 2023, Zsd maps revealed significant seasonal fluctuations in transparency. Among the 24 monitored lakes, one exhibited an upward trend, while 11 showed declining trends. The analysis also identified a positive correlation between Zsd and water levels in Poyang and Dongting Lakes, suggesting that higher water levels contribute to higher transparency. However, short-term ecological measures, such as returning embankments to lakes, did not result in measurable improvements in Zsd. This study highlights the importance of systematic monitoring of lake transparency to assess ecosystem health. It demonstrates the potential of integrating remote sensing and machine learning for effective water management and provides a foundation for evaluating the long-term outcomes of ecological restoration policies.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2025	177								113770	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113770		AUG 2025											WOS:001517386000005

However, the effects of early dry season on soil ARGs in wetlands remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the influence of early dry season on the abundance and composition of soil ARGs through a controlled field experiment and high-throughput quantitative PCR in Dongting Lake (DL) wetland. The results indicated that the abundance of ARGs were significantly increased as the following order: E0 < E20 < E40 (corresponding to the dry season earlier by 0, 20, and 40 days). The alpha diversity significantly increased, and the ARG profiles were markedly changed with the increased lead time of the dry season. Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis showed that lead time, pH, bacterial abundance, and plasmids were strongly associated with the abundance of multiple ARG types, while redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that lead time was identified as the primary driver of ARG variations. Overall, our findings demonstrate that early dry season has significant influences on the soil ARGs in wetland, which provide new insights for hydrological regulation of ARG dynamics.

Lake drainage occurs through two distinct mechanisms, namely lateral drainage and internal drainage. Here, we identified 3,969 lake drainage events from 2001 to 2020 across the northern permafrost region using high-resolution, multi-temporal satellite imagery. For each drainage event, we determined its specific timing and mechanism, enabling the first circumpolar classification of lake drainage types at monthly resolution. Lateral drainage accounted for 90.6% of all cases and peaked in June, aligning with increased snowmelt and precipitation in continuous permafrost regions. In contrast, internal drainage events were concentrated in March, when soils begin to thaw in sporadic and isolated permafrost zones with limited surface water input. These findings highlight distinct seasonal and climatic drivers of lake drainage and underscore the need to differentiate between surface and subsurface pathways when assessing permafrost landscape responses.

Growing anthropogenic pressure alters their functioning, causing accelerated eutrophication. Understanding the scale of alteration in ecological functions could assist with combat strategies. Bacterial communities regulate the transition of functional traits in aquatic ecosystems. However, current knowledge is still elusive regarding the variability of the environmental drivers dictating the functional roles in dynamic regimes like littoral zones. This study assessed how seasonal and circumlimnal conditions influenced sediment characteristics, bacterioplankton communities, and putative ecological functions (specifically biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur) in the hypertrophic freshwater Lake Pichola (Rajasthan, India). Findings suggest a significant seasonal drivers' influence on sediment characteristics, while the anthropopressure-aided niche partitioning promoted species richness and diversity in the hypertrophic lake. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, and Firmicutes were abundant phyla; chemoheterotrophy and fermentation are the dominant potential putative functions; methylotrophy, nitrate reduction, and sulfate reduction are prominent nutrient cycling biogeochemical functions. Redundancy analysis accurately explained the influence of sediment characteristics on the variability of biogeochemical functions. Shifts in bacterioplankton communities were evident within circumlimnal regimes with greater anthropogenic stress, promoting higher abundance and diversity of putative bacteria orchestrating the ecological functions. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the interplay among the functional traits and environmental factors dynamics in littoral sediments for studying biogeochemical transformation in lakes.

They are highly susceptible to nutrient enrichment and eutrophication, which alter aquatic communities. As a recently recognised biosphere-engineer, phytoplankton is a key target in urban monitoring programs Thus, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of phytoplankton morpho-functional classification schemes to better assess environmental changes in urban FBS. We applied two morpho-functional approaches across 15 urban waterbodies in different seasons (cold and warm) and regime types (clear water, phytoplankton-turbid, or free-floating-plant dominated). We also examined the relationship between within-lake spatial heterogeneity (presence/absence of macrophytes) and trophic status with phytoplankton structure. Results showed that phytoplankton assemblages varied significantly due to seasonality, regime type, trophic status, and within-lake heterogeneity. Key ecological groups, such as bloom-forming and potentially toxic Cyanobacteria, indicated phytoplankton-turbid and hypertrophic waters (IndVal: > 50%). Given their relative simplicity compared to taxonomic approaches and their sensitivity in detecting degraded conditions across diverse FBS, morpho-functional methods are valuable tools for environmental monitoring, complementing traditional assessments based on physical and chemical parameters. We also emphasise the importance of considering seasonal and within-lake variability when designing sampling strategies to assess the ecological status of urban FBS.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				2025 AUG 21	2025										10.1007/s10750-025-05974-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-025-05974-3		AUG 2025											WOS:001558231400001

A climatological baseline for understanding patterns of seasonal lake dynamics across sub-Sahelian Africa	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												Lakes in sub-Sahelian Africa are facing growing ecological threats from climate change and human, yet most research has focused on a handful of well-known large lakes. This study analyses 137 lakes, many previously understudied, and identifies consistent seasonal co-variability patterns across meteorological variables, satellite-derived lake physical and biogeochemical variables, and morphological and anthropogenic characteristics. We identify four distinct clusters of lakes, shaped by the atmospheric variability and its synchrony with water temperature seasonality. Within each cluster, we observe three seasonal patterns of chlorophyll-a concentration tied to wet and dry seasons. These patterns align with regional climatic threats in Africa, such as shifts in rainfall seasonality, altered frequency of tropical cyclones and wildfires, thus positioning our study as a framework to assess lake vulnerability across the sub-Sahelian region.					; Amadori, Marina/HZI-1527-2023; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Merchant, Christopher/KHY-0611-2024; Serrao, Livia/AAD-6564-2022	Pinardi, Monica/0000-0001-5289-8842; Amadori, Marina/0000-0001-8810-8478; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988; Greife, A.

Our aims were to explore spatio-temporal patterns in macroinvertebrate communities and evaluate the ecological health of various parts of the Poyang Lake Basin during the early stage of a fishing ban. We collected samples using a Peterson grab sampler and conducted ecological evaluations using the B-IBI index. A total of 107 species of macroinvertebrates were identified, and most species were arthropods. The density and biomass of macroinvertebrates significantly differed among seasons and water bodies. No significant differences in diversity among seasons were observed; however, diversity significantly varied among water bodies. Environmental parameters such as water depth, pH, turbidity, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a played a crucial role in shaping the community structure of macroinvertebrates. Most of the sampling sites were classified as healthy or sub-healthy, indicating that the fishing ban policy has started to have a positive effect. The effects of this ban are achieved through a cascading sequence of processes, including the elimination of fishing disturbance, the restoration of habitat structure, and the reallocation of trophic energy, in addition to increases in microhabitat diversity associated with habitat heterogeneity. Together, these processes drive the multidimensional recovery of macroinvertebrate communities, manifested as increased species richness, higher density and biomass, and elevated B-IBI scores.

Previous studies on short and shallow sediment cores identified seasonal hydrological signals and connections with North Atlantic modes of climate variability. This study presents a new 20 m composite sequence from the deepest basin of Grand Lake, providing high-resolution insights into sedimentary processes over the last ca. 3300 years. As a potential key environmental archive for north-eastern Canada, a region where high-resolution palaeoclimate records are scarce, Grand Lake offers a unique opportunity to examine long-term sedimentary and climatic interactions. Previous research did not examine temporal changes in sedimentary processes or the specific mechanisms driving mass sediment deposition, limiting the distinction and interpretation of climate controls on longer time scales. Here, sedimentological and geochemical characteristics are used to reconstruct sedimentation dynamics and erosional processes. Several rapidly deposited layers are characterised over changing depositional environments during the Late Holocene, from a phase when the lake was connected to the sea to a more stable state conducive to varve formation. A combination of end-member modelling analysis, lithofacies descriptions and high-resolution mu-XRF proxies revealed density currents as the dominant sedimentation process. Their origins ranged from proximal sources (gully systems) to distal sources (tributary rivers), with contributions varying over time, reflecting the transition from a marine-influenced system to a post-glacial fjord lake. The results provide a framework for future palaeoclimate studies in the region by contributing to a better understanding of sedimentary dynamics in a deep glacial lake, with implications for regional palaeoclimate reconstructions. Additionally, this study highlights the broader applicability of statistical unmixing for interpreting grain-size variations in both lacustrine and marine environments.					; St-Onge, Guillaume/E-4828-2014	Francus, Pierre/0000-0001-5465-1966; 														2055-4877				2025 AUG 19	2025										10.1002/dep2.70020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dep2.70020		AUG 2025											WOS:001551793600001

Impacts of hypoxia on boreal lake biogeochemistry and productivity: a 4-year whole-ecosystem BACI experiment	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Climate warming is increasing thermal stratification depth, strength, and duration in lakes, leading to more frequent hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. Most research has focused on eutrophic temperate lakes, which differ significantly from boreal lakes that dominate Earth's landscape. However, assessing the impact of hypoxia, confounded by browning, warming, and altered stratification, on biogeochemistry and ecological processes in boreal lakes is particularly challenging. Here, we test how oxygenating a hypoxic hypolimnion affects water chemistry, bacterial and primary production (BP and PP), and detritus degradation in a shallow humic boreal lake divided into two basins in an experimental four-year Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) design. After two control years, we oxygenated the hypolimnion of one basin during two stratified periods without disturbing the seasonal development of the thermocline. Hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations moderately impacted lake biogeochemistry. Reoxygenation altered nitrification pathways (increased NO3-) of the hypolimnion, and slightly decreased epilimnion and lake BP (- 6.1% of annual average) and green tea degradation (- 6.0%), whereas Rooibos degradation slightly increased (7.3%). Other water chemistry parameters remained within natural variation. We compared our BACI approach, which separates natural variation, to the simpler Before vs After approach, which does not. We find that studies not accounting for seasonal and among-year variability may overestimate the effects of oxygenation on hypolimnion biogeochemistry, as much of the observed impact is due to natural climate variation. Climate warming and altered stratification patterns are therefore likely to impact boreal lake algal and bacterial production and degradation more than hypolimnion hypoxia during the stratified period.					sarneel, judith/G-5248-2010														0168-2563	1573-515X				AUG 19	2025	168	4							67	10.1007/s10533-025-01262-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-025-01262-3													WOS:001552745400001

Comparably, prediction of N2O water-air emissions is much more limited, especially at the national level. Here, we collected published N2O emission data across China's watersheds and analyzed spatiotemporal patterns during dry and wet seasons. We predicted N2O emission fluxes from these waterbodies for 2026-2028 using a traditional gray prediction model (GM) coupled with several deep learning models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). The study showed large regional variation in emissions from subtropical to boreal watersheds. Average emission rates varied from 13.95 (+/- 27.15) mu g m-2 h-1 in the Yellow River Basin to 68.71 (+/- 102.62) mu g m-2 h-1 in Southwest China. N2O emissions were clearly higher in the dry season than the wet season in all regions except the Yellow River Basin, indicating strong influence from wetland vegetation. Regarding model performance, higher accuracy was achieved by GRU and BiLSTM, which successfully predicted fluctuating increases of N2O emission fluxes in most regions from 2026 to 2028, reflecting seasonal changes. While LSTM performed less accurately, GRU and BiLSTM, evolved from LSTM, may be more appropriate for complex situations. These findings provide insights into national spatiotemporal patterns of N2O emissions and can guide regional and national mitigation strategies as well as future research.

Between 2017 and 2021, the author conducted modified Pollard Walk surveys on an opportunistic basis to assess the species composition, richness, and seasonal distribution of adult butterflies across the forest. A total of 225 butterfly species, representing six families across 122 genera, were recorded within a 2.1 km2 area. Species richness exhibited an annual bimodal pattern, with the highest diversity observed in May (n = 107) and April (n = 102) followed by October (n = 90) and the lowest in December (n = 33) and January (n = 61). Notable findings included the first record of Burara anadi anadi (de Nic & eacute;ville, 1884) in Nepal, along with sightings of Pithauria murdava (Moore, 1866), Prosotas bhutea (de Nic & eacute;ville, [1884]), and Liphyra brassolis brassolis (Westwood, 1864), all of which were documented after at least three decades in Nepal. This study represents the first checklist of butterflies in this highly urbanized and ecologically fragmenting tourism hub, underscoring the urgent need for conservation initiatives. The prospects of butterfly tourism, alongside other forms of wildlife tourism, are discussed as a solution to balance habitat conservation with economic development, potentially extending across the broader Himalayan region.

This study evaluated water quality along a riverine gradient in the Taojia River, as part of a broader ecological restoration initiative guided by a comprehensive scientific research project for the river. Following these efforts, the aquatic ecosystems of the basin were evaluated post-treatment, integrating both water quality indicators and microbial diversity analyses. The results indicated that water quality met Class IV standards (Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002), BOD5 reached its highest value during the wet season at 4.8 mg/L, CODMnpeaked at 12.3 mg/L during the normal season. DO levels were highest during the normal season at 8.4 mg/L, and EC reached 325 mu S/cm in the wet season. Water quality showed significant variation across four land use areas (A1-A4) along the Taojia River. A1 (mining area) experienced the highest pollution levels. A4 (orchard area) showed increased turbidity in the wet season and a higher pH in the dry season. A2 (agricultural area) and A3 (road area) had less impact on water quality, with smaller seasonal variations. Microbial diversity analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum, with relative abundance varying seasonally: 45 % in the dry season, 52 % in the wet season, and 48 % in the normal season. Significant positive correlations were found between microbial community structure and TP, CODMn, and BOD5, while pH, EC, and DO showed negative correlations, highlighting the crucial role of seasonal variations in these environmental factors on microbial distribution. Changes in microbial communities could influence water purification by modulating functional genes involved in nutrient cycling, organic matter degradation, and pollutant removal. These functional shifts reflected the ecosystem's capacity to respond to environmental stressors and maintain water quality. This study was innovative in its integrated assessment of microbial diversity and water quality across multiple land use types following ecological restoration, providing novel insights into how land use and seasonal dynamics jointly influence riverine ecosystem health. Our findings provide ecological insights into sustaining water quality and guiding river management practices following ecological restoration facilitated by ecological water replenishment.

Surface water temperatures across the six studied stations representing the Deepor Beel Ecological Time Series declined by similar to 2-3 degrees C between the two sampling periods, accompanied by shifts in pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentrations. Total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) increased notably in February 2025, indicating enhanced solute accumulation. Dissolved nitrate, o-phosphate, reactive silicate, and ammonium concentrations increased across all stations, while chlorophyll-a and carotenoid concentrations declined sharply, reflecting reduced phytoplankton biomass in February 2025. Phytoplankton communities exhibited a seasonal (early post-monsoon to late post-monsoon) shift from cyanobacterial (Planktothrix spp. dominated) assemblages in November 2024 to more taxonomically diverse communities in February 2025, including Pediastrum spp., Aulacoseira spp., and Chlorella spp. In November 2024, blooms were dominated by the cyanobacterium Planktothrix spp., comprising the majority of the phytoplankton community at stations DPB1, DPB2, and DPB5, with Microcystis spp. also contributing substantially at DPB5, DPB4, and DPB11. Both bloom-forming genera were tracked using bright-field microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Molecular characterization using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA metabarcoding data revealed station-specific bacterial heterogeneity, with dominance of Proteobacteria (Burkholderiaceae, Aeromonadaceae) and Bacteroidetes (Flavobacteriaceae). Eukaryotic communities were dominated by member of Fungi (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), in addition to members belonging to Protists and other metazoan groups . Mantel tests revealed significant correlations between bloom-forming cyanobacteria and key environmental variables, highlighting distinct ecological drivers for Planktothrix and Microcystis. The analysis provided a robust, distance-based approach to link taxa with environmental gradients despite limited sample size. The findings from the study highlight the profound influence of seasonal environmental variability on microbial community structure and algal bloom dynamics, providing critical insights for management and conservation of tropical freshwater wetlands.

While most recent studies have emphasized anthropogenic sources (direct releases, produced waters, spills, roads, and other sources to the environment from human activities), the role of natural geochemical processes remains comparatively understudied. Here, we assess seasonal and spatial variation in heavy metal concentrations in water and sediments of the Napo and Pastaza drainage basins in eastern Ecuador, with an assessment of potential environmental and health risks. We analyzed total and bioavailable concentrations of ten heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, V, Zn) in water and in sediment samples using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Metal concentrations often exceeded background levels in the Amazon Basin, with some values comparable to those in mining-impacted areas. Geological factors such as black shale weathering and volcanism likely explain regional patterns. Despite occasional high values, enrichment factors were generally low. Key physicochemical variables influenced metal distribution, and most metals were found to be immobile and biologically unavailable. Seasonal and spatial variations in metal concentrations reflected trends seen in other tropical floodplain systems, indicating common, widespread drivers of aquatic metal levels across Amazonia. Important physicochemical factors, such as hardness, pH, organic matter, and dissolved oxygen, showed habitat-specific effects on metal concentrations. Although distribution coefficients (Kd) and mobility factors (MF) suggested that most sites had metals that were immobile and biologically unavailable, few locations showed high chances of metal migration, which could pose environmental and human health risks. Overall, our results imply limited immediate threat to ecosystems or human populations but highlight the need for continued monitoring of identified hotspots.

This study aims to develop an upwelling prediction model based on historical climate data in Lake Laut Tawar, Central Aceh, Aceh Province, to support the preparedness of floating net cage (KJA) farmers in facing upwelling risks. Upwelling due to climate change impacts mass fish mortality, so predictions are needed to provide early warning. This study design uses an observational approach with time series analysis, involving 2,556 observational data from six climate variables collected from NASA from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2023. Given the enormous volume and high temporal resolution of the climate data collected over seven years, which constitutes a form of big data, these computational methods are particularly well-suited for capturing the complex, dynamic relationships inherent in the dataset. The analysis process includes modelling with Vector Autoregressive Moving Average (VARMA) and Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methods, as well as Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification. The best model is selected based on the smallest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value and autocorrelation-freeness assumption. Model evaluation uses error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The analysis results show that the Seasonal VARMA (1,0,2)(0,0,1)30 and VAR(6) models provide accurate predictions with the lowest AIC of -23.04 and - 8.43, respectively. At the same time, the SVM algorithm with Polynomial and RBF kernels produces an optimal F1-score of 0.985. This study concludes that integrating time series and machine learning methods in the prediction model can effectively mitigate the risk of upwelling. The developed model was implemented in a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard to facilitate monitoring and decision-making by KJA farmers. This study provides a proactive and preventive approach that can reduce economic losses due to the upwelling phenomenon.

Here, through seasonal monitoring of lake pH and LGD-derived total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes in a hydrologically representative freshwater lake within the central Yangtze River plain, we provided robust evidence that LGD profoundly exacerbated lake acidification. The groundwater (pH: 6.53-7.85) had a higher acidity than the lake water (pH: 7.26-8.83), and the negative correlation between 222Rn activity and pH in the lake water suggested potential role of groundwater discharge in lowering lake pH. Seasonal hydrological changes induced notable fluctuations in LGD rates, which were consistent with changes in lake TA, DIC concentrations, and lake pH. During the dry season, LGD rate peaked at 80.03 mm/d, which caused the lake's average TA:DIC ratio to decline to its annual minimum (1.28 +/- 0.07), and the pH to drop to 7.86 +/- 0.18. Although the inflow of Yangtze River water temporarily raised lake pH to 8.72 +/- 0.06, continued LGD input remained the dominant driver of acidification after the wet season. Unlike ocean acidification, LGD-driven acidification exhibits strong seasonality and more uniform spatial distribution. The influence of LGD on lake acidification is more directly controlled by the original hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater. Our study reveals for the first time the dynamic impact of LGD on acidification in a typical inland freshwater lake, central China, and provides new insights into the acidification of specific freshwater lakes.

During initial phases (August and November, 2023) of the 10-year fishing ban in the Yangtze river basin, we investigated fish diversity, seasonal variations, and their correlation with environmental factors in the Jinsha river using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. Utilizing two pairs of 12S rRNA primers, MiFish-U and AcMDB07, we identified 61 fish species across 5 orders, 17 families, and 52 genera, including 4 national protected and 7 invasive alien fish. Among them, Cypriniformes constituted the predominant group within the fish community, accounting for 65.6%. This finding aligns with the results from a recent fish catch study, which recorded 68 species of fish belonging to 4 orders, 15 families, and 48 genera, including 4 national protected species and 8 invasive alien fish. The alpha diversity analysis revealed compositional differences in the fish community across various regions and seasons. Furthermore, key environmental factors, such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, nitrate nitrogen, total suspended solids, and conductivity, were found to be highly correlated with fish diversity in the Jinsha river. Consequently, we provided detailed seasonal data on fish diversity and its correlations with environmental factors, which will aid in the systematic management and restoration of fisheries and the assessment of the 10-year fishing ban in the Jinsha river.

Yukon River Inconnu: Biology, distribution, and migration	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective Inconnu Stenodus leucichthys are widely distributed throughout the Yukon River drainage from its headwaters in Canada to its mouth at the Bering Sea in western Alaska, United States. Population-level details, including spawning origins, migrations, age structure, and anadromous tendencies, have only recently been explored. The advent of several new technologies over the past 30 years, including those associated with radiotelemetry, genetics, and otolith aging and chemistry, has expanded our understanding of Inconnu migration patterns, population structure, longevity, anadromy, and more. Here, we review and synthesize recent research efforts on Inconnu within the Yukon River in Alaska.Methods Radiotelemetry studies were used to identify Inconnu migration patterns and to locate spawning areas in the Yukon River in Alaska. Subsequent population-specific sampling efforts were then conducted to collect length and weight data, tissue for genetic analyses, and otoliths for aging and chemistry analyses. These data were used to describe demographic qualities, growth patterns, anadromous tendencies, and population-specific survival estimates for Yukon River Inconnu.Results Six spawning areas-three that had not been previously identified-were located in the Alaskan portion of the Yukon River drainage. Consecutive-year spawning occurred for some individuals, most commonly from populations with the greatest tendency for anadromy. Genetic relationships among populations indicated two major groupings separated by spawning area distance from the sea. Otolith chemistry studies suggested variable levels of anadromous tendency among populations as far as 1,700 km from the sea, including individuals that migrate between salt water and freshwater annually and those that remain in freshwater throughout life. Age structure data from some populations revealed significant differences in annual survival, possibly due to different levels of exploitation.Conclusions These findings indicate that while populations of Inconnu in the Yukon River occupy many of the same habitats seasonally, they experience different life history patterns, which may result from spawning area locations that influence anadromous tendencies, spawning frequency, exposure to exploitation or predation, longevity, and survival. The Inconnu is a valuable food resource for people living along the Yukon River, particularly when Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. runs are weak. An understanding of spawning origins and migration patterns will inform harvest and management practices and provide a strong basis for protection of spawning areas.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2025	154	5					505	522		10.1093/tafafs/vnaf026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/tafafs/vnaf026		AUG 2025											WOS:001548838700001

Lamellidens marginalis, commonly available in South Asian countries, plays an essential role in the aquatic food chain. This study investigated the growth indices and reproductive activity of L. marginalis from a freshwater lake, aiming to understand its stock structure and sustainable exploitation rate. Furthermore, nutritional profiling of tissue was conducted to assess its potential for aquaculture. The results revealed significant variations in the mean biometric parameters across genders and periods. Compared with males, females presented numerically greater dimensions in all body measurements, except for shell height. The overall relationship between body weight and shell length indicated negative allometric growth ('b' values ranged between 2.430 and 3.156 for males and between 1.506 and 2.792 for females). The condition index exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations, with a rapid increase during April and June and a sharp decrease in July-August, potentially linked to gonadal maturation and spawning. Histological examination revealed a significantly male-dominated mussel population with an overall sex ratio of 1:0.89 (male: female). However, the histological analysis did not identify sexually undifferentiated and hermaphroditic individuals. This species displayed a continuous reproductive ability year-round, with a peak in July-August at 32.30-34.50 degrees C. L. marginalis has the potential to be an excellent food source for animal on the basis of its nutritional values, and its biochemical composition was closely linked with reproductive activity. The outcomes of this study will guide the sustainable conservation of natural populations and the use of this species in aquaculture.

This study investigated the spatiotemporal hydrochemical dynamics of Lake Guiers, which supplies 50 % of Dakar's drinking water, and examined natural and anthropogenic drivers of water mineralization. The approach combined multivariate statistics, hydrogeochemical analysis (Piper, Gibbs), and Water Quality Index (WQI) assessments of samples collected over five seasonal campaigns (2022-2023) as well as hydroclimatic analysis. Seasonal variations and spatial gradients of 22 parameters (physicochemical, major ions, biological, heavy metals) were explored to inform effective freshwater management strategies. New hydrological insights for the region: Multidisciplinary approach highlights impact of intensified agriculture and inflows on spatiotemporal variations in water quality. WQI values categorized 67-87 % of samples as poor water quality, with conditions worsening during the rainy season. Several parameters including heavy metals, cyanobacteria, chlorophyll-a and turbidity exceeded WHO standards. Temporal variations were influenced by evaporation during the dry season, agricultural discharge, and the combination of runoff and inflow waters during the rainy season. Sediment loaded inflow from the Taouey canal notably leads to greater turbidity and suspended particulate matter in the north of the lake, while runoff and associated mobility of nutrients favour cyanobacteria proliferation during the rainy season. Targeted interventions to reduce pollution sources and continuous monitoring of transitory drainage and runoff in selected hotspots are required to preserve this vital semi-arid freshwater lake.

The reduction in SSC may influence chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in water, thereby further affecting the aquatic ecological environment. However, the effect of reduced SSC on Chl-a is poorly studied. Here, we compared and analyzed the distribution conditions of Chl-a in 6 representative years for both before the implementation of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) (BIT) and after the implementation of TGD (AIT), using the TM/OLI data and NIR-red inversion model. The findings showed that, from BIT to AIT, the area proportion of ultraoligotrophic state significantly decreased, while the area proportion of oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic states significantly increased, with eutrophic state observed for the first time in 2017. Additionally, a significant correlation between Chl-a concentration and SSC was found. The area proportion of ultraoligotrophic state was positively correlated with SSC, while oligotrophic and mesotrophic states were negatively correlated with SSC. The reduction in SSC enhanced water promoting phytoplankton growth and consequently increasing Chl-a concentrations. This study highlights the spatiotemporal variations of Chl-a dynamics in DL before and after the operation of the TGD and discusses the impacts of SSC on water trophic states and the ecosystem. The findings provide valuable scientific insights for large-scale lake water quality monitoring and offer critical reference points for future water quality management strategies.

This study investigated how meteorological and vegetation dynamics regulate spatio-temporal patterns of LGD and pollutant fluxes in Ulansuhai Lake (UL), a representative agricultural drainage lake in arid northwest China. Based on hydrochemical indicators, a radon mass balance model, and remote sensing, results showed that the average LGD rate on the western side (10.50 mm/d) was substantially higher than that on the eastern side (3.49 mm/d), with peak LGD observed during the dry season (5.63 mm/d), followed by the normal (3.17 mm/d) and wet seasons (2.60 mm/d). Meteorological factors and vegetation coverage dynamics were identified as the primary controls of LGD and pollutant fluxes. Specifically, intensive canal irrigation supporting large-scale intensive cropland on the western side of Ulansuhai Lake created west-focused hotspots for both LGD rates and total nitrogen fluxes by influencing groundwater flow and pollutant sources. In contrast, evaporation-induced high alkalinity and well irrigation on the eastern side suppressed LGD processes and shifted fluoride flux hotspots eastward. Sensitivity analyses revealed that lake water radon concentration, groundwater radon concentration, wind speed, and water depth were the dominant factors affecting the accuracy of the radon mass balance model. This study advances the understanding of LGD and its associated pollutant fluxes from both spatial and temporal perspectives, providing a reference case for a newly emerging type of lake.					li, muhan/JJG-1948-2023														0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2025	662		C						134061	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.134061		AUG 2025											WOS:001549819100001

XXX-XXX.Watercraft inspection stewards in the Finger Lakes region of New York State educated boat operators about the identification and effects of aquatic invasive species and inspected watercraft and trailers entering and exiting waterbodies. In addition to recording and removing all macrophytes encountered, stewards noted intended activity on the water, type of watercraft, watercraft direction (launching or retrieving), the name of the waterbody, steward, and launch, with the date and year. Launches were categorized into one of 8 compass directions relative to the waterbody's center, as prevailing winds may influence the presence of macrophyte fragments. From 2021 to 2023, 58 stewards conducted 79,326 inspections at 23 launches. Using a mixed effects generalized additive model, we analyzed 9 variables to assess their mutual influence on macrophyte encounter rates on watercraft and trailers. Date was smoothed with a cubic spline, and year was included as a random effect. The final model, selected based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), included direction, activity, type of watercraft, launch, steward, date, and year, explaining similar to 30% of deviance overall. Direction alone explained similar to 18% of the deviance: Macrophyte encounter rates on watercraft and trailers exiting waterbodies were 5.5 times higher than on those entering (41% vs. 7.5%). Future research should examine relationships between encounter rates and seasonal biomass phenology, quantify separate encounter rates for watercraft and trailers, and evaluate macrophyte management strategies at launches.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				2025 AUG 11	2025										10.1080/10402381.2025.2543784	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2025.2543784		AUG 2025											WOS:001569889400001

In this study, Sb isotopic composition was investigated along two rivers impacted by mining and smelting activities in the city of Oruro (Bolivia). Antimony concentration and isotope ratio were measured in water, suspended particulate matter and sediments during two contrasted seasons along a gradient of pH (from 1.6 to 6.5) and Sb concentration (from 8057 to 7 mu g.L-1). Antimony isotopic composition varied over a range of similar to 1 parts per thousand considering all sample types (-0.09 <= delta Sb-123 <= + 0.93 parts per thousand). The main stream impacted by acid mine drainage showed a progressive increase of delta Sb-123 in the dissolved phase (+ 0.42 to + 0.70 parts per thousand), concomitant to Fe precipitation and Sb concentration decrease. This suggested that natural Sb attenuation by sorption onto neoformed Fe oxyhydroxysulphates was involved as this process favours light isotopes in the solid (Delta Sb-123(water-sediments) averaged + 0.3 parts per thousand). Smelting-impacted tributary exhibited lighter dissolved Sb (+ 0.29 <= delta Sb-123 <= + 0.36 parts per thousand). Lake Uru-Uru which receives both rivers exhibited a delta Sb-123 value of + 0.28 parts per thousand in the wet season and + 0.55 parts per thousand in the dry season, which might reflect different contributions of the AMD- and smelter-impacted rivers. The study reveals, for the first time, the impact of two distinct anthropogenic sources on antimony (Sb) isotopic composition on a water body and provides new insights into the ability of antimony isotopes to trace sources and processes in contaminated aquatic systems.

The pathogen enters the environment through rodent excreta, and extreme weather events-such as floods-enhance its transmission to humans. This study analyses the incidence of leptospirosis in Kerala state, examines the distribution of Leptospira in the water column of Vembanad Lake, a Ramsar site and the largest lake in the state, and investigates the influence of land use patterns and the physical and chemical properties of the water column. Water samples for analysis were collected at approximately 20-day intervals over 12 months from 13 stations in Vembanad Lake. Analysis of the decadal dataset of disease incidence indicates that the region is endemic to leptospirosis, with nearly 50% of the cases reported in 2018-particularly in areas surrounding Vembanad Lake-occurring in September, coinciding with a once-in-a-century flood. A significant positive correlation was observed between rainfall and disease incidence (r = 0.73, p < 0.05). Over the past 50 years, built-up areas around the lake have expanded by nearly 150%, providing less space for water and increasing the likelihood of floods that can transmit pathogens. Molecular surveillance using quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Leptospira is prevalent in the lake, with gene copies ranging from 4.62 x 105 (Log(1)(0) 5.67) to 3.98 x 10(7) (Log(1)(0) 7.60) per ml during the rainy season (June-December) and 2.8 x 10(6) (Log(1)(0) 6.63) to 1.53 x 10(8) (Log(1)(0) 8.18) per ml during the dry season (January-May). Results indicate that the distribution of Leptospira in Vembanad Lake is influenced by temperature, pH, and nutrient composition (PO4 and NO2) of the water column. This study highlights the prevalence of Leptospira in the lake's water column and the heightened risk of transmission to humans during extreme weather events. It underscores the need for a multifaceted approach, including molecular and remote sensing-based pathogen surveillance, public awareness initiatives, integrated floodwater management, rodent control measures in urban planning, and targeted interventions to mitigate environmental transmission.					; ASHRAF, NIZAM/OFM-8494-2025; Abdulaziz, Anas/AAI-5681-2020	Abdulaziz, Anas/0000-0002-1396-3645; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				AUG 7	2025	236	12							768	10.1007/s11270-025-08417-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-025-08417-w													WOS:001546838100009

Integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral data with machine learning algorithms enables accurate estimation of DOM. However, the stability of models in different periods-such as those affected by seasonal variations and environmental condition changes-is the key factor affecting their application. This study employed a spectral correction method to unify multi-temporal datasets. Estimation models were constructed using the 2023 dataset with Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest algorithms, and their cross-year performance was validated on the 2024 dataset through transfer learning. Results showed that models trained on corrected data outperformed those using raw spectra, with an average R2 increase of 15.67%, and reductions of 10.27% in RMSE and 6.44% in MAE on the test set. After transfer learning optimization, the model using the corrected spectrum still exhibited superior performance in 2024. Compared with the original spectrum, an average R2 improvement of 30.67%, along with reductions of 17% in RMSE and 11.67% in MAE. Among the three algorithms, the Random Forest model yielded the best performance, with an R2 of 0.82, RMSE of 3.1 mg/L, and MAE of 2.37 mg/L on the test set. The proposed approach in this study effectively mitigates the temporal impact on model performance and enhances the temporal generalization capability of DOM estimation models.

Although the INPP was decommissioned in 2009, its legacy continues to influence the lake's thermal regime. Using Landsat 8 thermal infrared imagery and NDVI-based methods, we analysed spatial and temporal LST variations from 2013 to 2024. The results indicate persistent temperature anomalies and elevated LST values, particularly in zones previously affected by thermal discharges. The years 2020 and 2024 exhibited the highest average LST values; some years (e.g., 2018) showed lower readings due to localised environmental factors such as river inflow and seasonal variability. Despite a slight stabilisation observed in 2024, temperatures remain higher than those recorded in 2013, suggesting that pre-industrial thermal conditions have not yet been restored. These findings underscore the long-term environmental impacts of industrial activity and highlight the importance of satellite-based monitoring for the sustainable management of land, water resources, and coastal zones.

The Eocene epoch marks a pivotal period in Earth's transition to modern climate patterns and vegetation, offering insights into future global warming and ecological responses. Lacustrine deposits in Northeast China preserve important "deep-time" paleoclimatic information, providing a terrestrial perspective for studying Eocene climate change. This study reconstructed Eocene vegetation dynamics, climate parameters and CO2 levels of the Yilan Basin in Northeast China through palynological analysis, the Coexistence Approach (CA) method, the Climate Amplitude Method (CAM) and delta 13Cwood records. An Eocene climate evolution model for Northeast China was established, addressing climate sensitivity, oceanic-lacustrine thermal event correlations, vegetation responses, and post-thermal event climate regulation mechanisms against the backdrop of extreme hot-cold alternations during the Eocene. Our study fills the gap in understanding the Eocene climate of Heilongjiang Province. By comparing the Yilan Basin's climate reconstruction results with those from other regions, as well as CO2 reconstruction data with global Eocene atmospheric CO2 trends, we elucidated the climate evolution dynamics of Northeast China throughout the entire Eocene. The Yilan Basin featured a typical Ca (Humid subtropical) climate with significant seasonal variations, with a MAT of 11.6 f 0.1-21.3 f 0.6 degrees C and MAP of 652 f 40-1823 f 99 mm. Thermal events (ETM2, ETM3) and warmer intervals (EECO, MECO) triggered significant negative carbon isotope excursions, with these continental responses lagging behind their marine counterparts. Regional temperature and precipitation associated with thermal events increased notably, and vegetation and CO2 feedbacks to thermal and cooling events during the Eocene were consistent and coordinated. In post-thermal event climate regulation, silicate weathering and organic carbon burial played crucial roles, exerting negative feedbacks on CO2-driven warming.

Recognised as both an Important Bird Area (IBA) and part of the Natura 2000 network, the site supports large numbers of migratory and overwintering geese, ducks and other waterbirds. Since 2002, standardised surveys have been conducted during the non-breeding season to monitor population sizes and species composition. The site's location on major flyways and its habitat diversity make itvaluable for long-term ornithological monitoring. New information This dataset presents waterbird count data collected during the non-breeding season from 2002/2003 to 2024/2025, covering 23 seasons across 24 calendar years. The dataset includes 952 records of seasonal abundance for 14 waterbird species. The average total abundance was 7,933 (+/- 1,314 SE) individuals per season (mean of November, January and March), with a maximum of 36,095 in November 2002 and a minimum of 226 in March 2017. Trend analysis using the rtrim package in R indicated a moderate overall decline (lambda = 0.976, 95% CI: [0.975-0.977]). Species-specific trends varied, with some taxa, such as Greylag Goose (Anser anser Linnaeus, 1758), increasing, while others, including Greater White-fronted Goose (Anser albifrons Scopoli, 1769), Eurasian Teal (Anas crecca Linnaeus, 1758) and Eurasian Coot (Fulica atra Linnaeus, 1758), declined. The dataset contributes valuable baseline data for wetland bird conservation, ecological assessment and future research in Central Europe. Importantly, such long-term monitoring also provides a robust reference point for assessing changes in climate and biodiversity overtime.

We use Regional Ocean Modeling System to analyze thermal stratification, wind-driven processes, and circulation dynamics within the lake. Our findings show surface temperatures ranging from similar to 25.8 degrees C to similar to 27.8 degrees C seasonally, with a notable increase of up to 0.4 degrees C below 150 m depth between 2001 and 2020. Primary upwelling occurs in the southern region from May to August, while secondary upwelling is observed in the north from November to February. Bathymetric variations influence upwelling and downwelling processes. Our results emphasize that the interaction between atmospheric and hydrodynamic factors regulates the nutrient distribution, which is crucial for fisheries and biodiversity. We also highlight the importance of modeling in understanding the warming trends and ecological responses of Lake Tanganyika to climate change.

GWLs were monitored with automatic pressure transducers in both shallow and deep boreholes, and manually in hand-dug wells. Concurrently, water samples were collected for major ion chemistry and stable isotope analysis to delineate the groundwater flow system characteristics and dynamics. GWLs rise during the rainy season and recede during the dry season. However, GWLs in some deep boreholes rise later in the dry season, indicative of confined aquifers that are recharged from distal areas. During the dry season, certain deep boreholes displayed distinctive daily GWL fluctuation phases due to earth tides, characterized by amplitudes ranging from 2 to 3 cm in one phase and < 1 cm amplitude fluctuations in the second phase. Spectral analysis identified four main tidal periods: M2, S2, K1, and O1, with M2 and S2 being the most dominant. Quantitative tidal analysis further indicated that GWL dynamics in some deep boreholes reflect a semi-confined aquifer system. Hydrochemistry and isotope data demonstrated that groundwater evolves from rapidly circulating, Ca-HCO3 groundwaters in recharge areas to highly evolved Na-HCO3 and Mg-Ca-Na-HCO3 groundwaters in discharge areas. A conceptual groundwater flow model was developed from the integrated approach, revealing three distinct flow systems: shallow, intermediate, and deep. A comprehensive understanding of the groundwater response to hydrological processes and anthropogenic activities is essential for effective groundwater resources management.

This study aims an innovative framework to predict the total dissolved solids (TDS) with more accuracy in the rivers, case study: "Karkheh River", Iran, with the integration of signal analysis with machine learning algorithms. First, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was applied to decompose the time series of water quality variables (e.g., Ca, HCO3, SO4, and Cl) into their trends, seasonality, and residuals, extracting features that capture temporal dynamics. These features served as input for non-linear machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree) in differenct scenarios to compare which way of adding new feature would improve the model performance in terms of the TDS predictions. Adding new features characterized by only TDS signal analysis improved the TDS predictions and was compared with adding all variables signal characterization and compared with only using raw data to predict TDS level. Using a 50-year dataset from three different hydrometric stations, the models could achieve over 95% accuracy, and XGBoost outperformed others in terms of taking the advantage of the new extracted features from signals. The results indicates that signal-driven features significantly contribute to ccurately TDS prediction by 30% improvement in RMSE, and it can offer a scalable approach for real-time water quality monitoring in semi-arid river systems, which leads to a better early warning system for designing future mitigation strategies.

Its proliferation has caused widespread damage across Lake Nokoue<acute accent> in southern Benin, home to fishing communities that practice traditional fishing techniques called Acadja. Although these fishing structures increase fishing yields, they also exacerbate the water hyacinth infestation rate. This study, therefore, models the extent of water hyacinth, Acadja with attached water hyacinth, other land, and other vegetation in the Lake Nokoue<acute accent> area using Landsat Collection 2 Tier 1 and Sentinel-1 Cband Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery from 2015 to 2022 with Random Forest machine learning. Seventeen predictors were selected to model each land cover, including five spectral indices, seven spectral bands, two radar bands, and three terrain predictors. The model mapped a total of 17,413.4 ha for water, 2907.5 ha for water hyacinth, 1780.6 ha for Acadja, 2128.6 ha for other land, and 8289 ha for other vegetation areas by the end of 2022. The rate of change in the region since 2015 was - 6.8 % (water), +149.7 % (water hyacinth), +726.1 % (Acadja), - 20.6 % (other land), and -15 % (other vegetation) for each class. A separate method was also tested to compare the supervised modeling to an unsupervised method. Otsu segmentation was used for the same study period. Otsu detected 614 ha of vegetation for 2015 and increased to 1133 ha by 2022, but results indicate this method is unreliable. Vegetation found in Lake Nokoue<acute accent> was also assessed monthly from 2000 to 2022 using manual segmentation of a harmonic Landsat time series. By 2022, results indicated that infestations consistently maxed out during December and January and exponentially expanded. Although infestations traditionally peaked during November and December, the study found that lake vegetation increased by 941 % and 304 % for the high- (September to December) and low-water (January to May) seasons.

MPs were detected in all sediment samples, with their presence varying by sampling site and season. The MP abundances, measured as particles per 100 g of dry sediment, ranged from 9-22, with an average of 15.4 +/- 4.3. The identified MP shapes included fibers, fragments, and films, with fibers (41%), sizes 1-3 mm (33.3%), and the color blue (31.9%) being the most dominant. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis revealed polyethylene and polypropylene as the primary polymers. The pollution load index (PLI) and polymer hazard index (PHI) were used to assess sediment quality. PLI values indicated a low level of MP pollution in the sediments of Skadar Lake, suggesting a minor ecological risk. High PHI values were noted due to the presence of MPs with high-hazard score polymers. This study lays the groundwork for future monitoring and a better understanding of MP pollution, distribution, and potential sources in freshwater ecosystems. Our findings could support the implementation of preventive measures to reduce MP pollution in Skadar Lake, which is part of the National Park of Montenegro.

The model's effectiveness was validated by its consistency with observed energy fluxes, ground surface temperature, and the transpiration fraction of evapotranspiration (T/ET) derived from isotope methods, the underlying water use efficiency (uWUE) approach, and remote sensing data. Results show that T/ET ratios vary minimally from year to year, peaking in July or August and reaching their lowest in January. The subalpine shrub ecosystem exhibited the highest average T/ET, followed by temperate grasslands and alpine grasslands. Leaf area index, linked to canopy stomatal conductance, was the main driver of T/ET variability, along with environmental factors like radiation, soil moisture, and temperature. During the growing season, vegetation transpiration dominated ET, with T/ET rising in May and June due to thawing seasonally frozen soils and active plant growth.

Although this species penetrated fresh waters a long time ago and is known to prey on fish larvae, its habits and effects in these habitats were not studied sufficiently. The aim of this study was to investigate S. abaster predation on other fishes in invaded fresh waters in detail. The material for the study was collected between 2015 and 2020 in the Stugna River and Kaniv Reservoir (Dnieper River basin) during the breeding period of the majority of local fishes. The gut content analysis showed the presence of 44 prey taxa in the diet of S. abaster. The most important and frequently encountered prey were copepods. Fish larvae contributed 6.5-55.2 % of the total food items, while their relative importance in the diet ranged from 0.03 %IRI (percent index of relative importance) up to 14.36 % IRI. Four groups of fish prey were identified: Gobiidae, Cyprinidae, Perccottus glenii, and S. abaster juveniles. Fish were more frequently encountered and more abundant in the digestive tract of females than in males of S. abaster. Overall, the level of predation of this species on fish larvae was low and temporally associated with the massive spawning of co-occurring fishes inhabiting macrophytes. Previous studies suggest high to moderate probability of establishment of this species in the Laurentian Great Lakes if introduced, but the present study suggests relatively little effect on native fishes.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102613	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102613	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102613													WOS:001540922200029

This study investigates two calibration strategies: fixed scaling factors and time-varying scaling factors, for the bulk weather formula of Kondo (1975) integrated into the Fantom Refined 3D hydrodynamic model. The approach is applied to a small tropical lake (Sampaloc Lake, Philippines), with model calibration conducted using observed temperature profiles and satellite-derived weather data over a one-year period. This study is among the first to apply seasonally varying heat flux calibration using satellite-based inputs in 3D modeling of a tropical crater lake. Time-varying factors were adjusted monthly based on sensitivity analysis, while fixed factors were derived from initial values. Results show that time-varying factors significantly improved model accuracy during transitional monsoon periods, particularly in representing wind-driven mixing and light attenuation. Among the parameters tested, wind and light extinction factors exhibited strong seasonal variability, whereas shortwave, longwave, and air temperature factors remained relatively stable and may be treated as constants for long-term simulations. Model validation using an independent one-year dataset confirmed the robustness of both approaches. Fixed factors provided practical advantages in data-limited contexts without significant compromise in accuracy. The study offers a flexible calibration framework for weather-driven fluxes that improves model performance without relying on fully automated optimization. These findings contribute to more reliable lake temperature simulations and offer practical guidance for thermal modeling in tropical limnological applications.

This study investigated their occurrence and distribution in a tropical reservoir from June 2023 to May 2024. MPs were found at all sites, with an abundance ranging from 1.3 to 38.0 items m-3, predominantly fibers under 2000 mu m. Polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were the prevalent polymer types. The pollution load index of MPs was low (PLI = 2.6, level 1), but their high polymer hazard (PHI = 905.4, category IV) and ecological risk (PERI = 696.5, Danger) indicate potential environmental threats in Hoa Binh Reservoir. The MC toxin analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that total MC concentrations varied seasonally, with the highest value of 5.27 mu g L-1. Health risk assessment indicated that the overall risk from MCs in all sampling sites remains low (average HQ values of 0.14). This study confirmed the co-occurrence of MPs and MCs in all Hoa Binh Reservoir sampling locations during the entire study period, which could potentially favor the interaction between these contaminants. These findings highlight the need for more research on how MPs influence cyanotoxin, which is essential for developing effective water management and pollution control strategies in freshwater ecosystems.

This study examined the spatio-temporal dynamics of oxbow lakes in the Kalindri River basin in West Bengal, India, focusing on their roles in carbon sequestration and methane emission, to assess their net impact on climate change mitigation. Utilizing Landsat OLI satellite imagery, the study mapped oxbow lakes and estimated methane emissions and carbon sequestration over multiple seasons. The results demonstrate that while oxbow lakes emit methane, their carbon sequestration capacity is significantly higher, leading to a positive net balance in terms of mass regulation, global warming potential (GWP) and fixation cost. In 2023, the oxbow lakes sequestered 2.39 x 103 tons of carbon while emitting only 0.025 x 103 tons of methane, resulting in a net positive impact on GHG sinking and reducing the warming effect. Financially, the sequestration of carbon provides substantial economic benefits, with sequestration costs exceeding those of methane emissions. So, findings reported the positive role of oxbow lakes towards mitigating climate change. So, wetland conservation and restoration strategies would be a natural solution to climate change, emphasizing their potential for long-term GHG regulation and ecosystem service provision.																			2366-3286	2366-3294				AUG	2025	33	4							31	10.1007/s41324-025-00632-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41324-025-00632-1													WOS:001513586900001

Monitoring macrophytes can reveal ecosystem changes caused by anthropogenic pressures, such as eutrophication and biodiversity loss. While traditional field monitoring is resource-intensive, remote sensing offers a cost-effective alternative for large-scale vegetation assessment. This study developed machine learning models to detect macrophyte genera using medium- to high-resolution remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 MSI and PlanetScope SuperDove. Six macrophyte genera and open water were classified by combining multispectral data and machine learning techniques. The methodology included in situ and drone surveys, spectral signature extraction from satellite data, and seasonal reflectance analysis. After testing six machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest classifier demonstrated the most robust performance. The PlanetScope data-based model achieved an overall accuracy of 97% (Kappa = 0.95), outperforming Sentinel-2's 90% accuracy (Kappa = 0.85). PlanetScope performed better in classifying underrepresented genera like Nymphaea (80% accuracy), while Sentinel-2 showed strengths in mapping dominant genera such as Phragmites and Typha (over 93% accuracy). Key classification features included near-infrared (NIR) reflectance and temporal green and red band patterns. This work highlights the complementary strengths of Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope data for aquatic vegetation analysis and biodiversity assessments, providing a robust approach for tracking macrophyte dynamics in freshwater ecosystems.

In urban areas, particularly in metropolitan cities, keeping the quality of water sources becomes increasingly challenging due to pollution from industrial effluents, biomedical waste, drainage, and seasonal variations. The current research aims to address the issue of water pollution from the primary metropolitan source, Chembarambakkam Lake, which caters to >39 distribution zones, and to develop a smart technology-based strategy to monitor, analyze, and forecast the Water Quality Index (WQI) in real-time. The innovative sensor system was installed to observe water quality data continuously, and machine learning algorithms were used to enhance the prediction accuracy of the WQI. The research employs a hybrid model that combines a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for hyper parameter optimization and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict WQI trends between 2018 and 2023, utilizing both historical and current data with 5000 records. The GA-SVM hybrid model demonstrated robust predictive performance, achieving the highest accuracy with a low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.04474 and a high R-2 value of 0.96580, indicating excellent accuracy and reliability. Trend analysis also showed a progressive increase in pollution indicators, reflecting a compelling imperative for timely action. In conclusion, the study presents a robust and scalable system of smart water quality forecasting and monitoring. The model is viable, with significant practical implications for policy and environmental management, supporting sustainable water resource management in cities.

J	Kang, M; Park, J; Hyun, CU				Kang, Minkyeong; Park, Jeongwoo; Hyun, Chang-Uk			Satellite Imagery-Based Monitoring of Water Surface Variability and Its Relationship with Rainfall at Baengnokdam, Mount Hallasan, Jeju Island, South Korea	KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This study quantitatively analyzed the temporal changes in the surface area of the Baengnokdam Crater Lake, located at the summit of Mount Hallasan on Jeju Island, using PlanetScope satellite imagery, and evaluated its correlation with precipitation and water level. A total of 227 satellite images acquired between April and November from 2017 to 2024 were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and delineate the waterbody boundary of Baengnokdam. The NDWI-based analysis revealed distinct seasonal variability, with peak water surface areas frequently observed in May and September. To examine the temporal lag between rainfall events and the surface area response, the cross-correlation function was applied. The highest correlation (r = 0.496) was observed at a 4-day lag, suggesting the possibility of a time-lagged hydrological response. Regression analysis between water level and satellite imagery-derived surface area using data from 2021, 2022, and 2024 showed that the linear regression model yielded an average coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.741, outperforming the logarithmic model. The results demonstrated that an increase of 1,000 m2 in surface area corresponds to an average water level rise of approximately 24.1 cm. These findings demonstrate the applicability of time-series satellite imagery for exploring alpine lakes' responses to rainfall and for investigating the relationship between surface area and water level.																			1225-6161	2287-9307				AUG	2025	41	4					683	695		10.7780/kjrs.2025.41.4.5	http://dx.doi.org/10.7780/kjrs.2025.41.4.5													WOS:001574228100005

Study Focus: In this study, the performance of Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2) was evaluated to investigate their ability to replicate 12 rain gauge datasets in the SRB from 1983-2015. Validation was conducted at daily, monthly, and annual timescales using continuous and categorical statistical methods to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of these SRPs in the SRB. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: CHIRPS demonstrated consistent accuracy across most timescales, particularly during the wet season, while TAMSAT excelled in rainfall detection, supporting flood forecasting and timely decision-making in agricultural planning. PERSIANN-CDR consistently overestimated rainfall, limiting its use for drought monitoring, while ARC2 underperformed in most metrics. Spatial analysis revealed a north-to-south rainfall gradient, influenced by elevation and proximity to Lake Malawi. These findings highlight the potential of SRPs such as CHIRPS and TAMSAT as viable alternatives for hydrological applications in data-scarce regions like the SRB, emphasizing the need for thorough validation before use.					; Kumambala, Patsani/LLM-0467-2024; Monjerezi, Maurice/HHR-9470-2022; Ngongondo, Cosmo/LBH-8357-2024	KUMAMBALA, PATSANI/0000-0003-3947-6295; 														2214-5818				AUG	2025	60								102618	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102618	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102618													WOS:001534543100002

Changes in the Diet of the Zander Sander lucioperca (Percidae) in the Kama Reservoir as a Result of Invasion of an Alien Species the Black and Caspian Sea Sprat Clupeonella cultriventris (Ehiravidae)	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												-In the modern period, the role of native species, the roach Rutilus rutilus and perch Perca fluviatilis, has significantly decreased in the diet of the zander Sander lucioperca in the Kama Reservoir in comparison with the retrospective data, and their place has been taken by the Black and Caspian Sea sprat Clupeonella cultriventris, which was most intensively fed by zander in August and September. The occurrence of Black and Caspian Sea sprat in stomachs of zander was lower in May and especially in October, which may be related to the dynamics of its abundance and seasonal movements in the reservoir. Juvenile zander with a standard length of less than 40 cm is characterized by a decrease in the average body length of the consumed sprat with an increase in the size of the predator, whereas the opposite was found for adult individuals. This dependence can be explained by a high feeding rate of zander juveniles and low selectivity of this group of fish when hunting for sprat, as well as by the dynamics of the size composition of sprat in the reservoir. Black and Caspian Sea sprat is currently the dominant food object of zander in the Kama Reservoir.																			0032-9452	1555-6425				AUG	2025	65	4					701	712		10.1134/S0032945225700110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0032945225700110													WOS:001553169000007

This study investigates Chochen Lake in the Barapathing area of Sikkim's Pakyong district, which is facing severe water seepage and instability. The problem, intensified by the 2011 seismic event and ongoing local construction, is examined through subsurface fracture mapping using Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) and profiling techniques. A statistical factor method, applied to interpret VES data, helped identify fracture patterns beneath the lake. Results from two sites (VES-1 and VES-2) reveal significant variations in weathered and semi-weathered soil layers, indicating fractures at depths of 17-50 m (VES-1) and 20-55 m (VES-2). Higher fracture density near VES-1 suggests increased settlement risk and ground displacement compared to VES-2. Contrasting resistivity values emphasize the greater instability in this zone and the need for cautious construction practices. The findings highlight the role of seismic-induced fractures in ongoing water depletion and underscore the importance of continuous dewatering to stabilize the swampy terrain.

J	Pasqualini, JP; Mainardi, F				Pasqualini, Joana Postal; Mainardi, Fernando			Probabilistic assessment of a simplified water quality model and its linkage to the hydrological characteristics of lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Simple models can be valuable for supporting the management of engineering applications across various fields, such as water resources and environmental sanitation. However, the inherent uncertainty associated with these approaches should be recognized and quantified to better support decision-making. This study assessed variability arising from two primary factors: the adoption of different numerical methods and parameter variability within a complete stirring tank reactor (CSTR) model applied for phosphorous predictions across four different hydrological conditions. An ensemble approach, integrating multiple numeric methods, was employed to evaluate numerical uncertainty. Parametric uncertainty was assessed through Monte Carlo simulations. The study focused solely on characterizing uncertainties without evaluating model performance or comparing the results from the applied models to observational data. The numerical and parametric uncertainty ranges were similar in reservoirs with low-volume fluctuations and differed in reservoirs where volume increased overtime. The overall magnitude of observed uncertainty depended on the hydrodynamics during the analysis period. The choice of numerical approach is particularly important in assessing cases involving seasonal shifts in volumetric storage or potential impacts from climate change. Results supported the theory that a probabilistic approach supports decision-making by encompassing a wider range of possible results. Moreover, due to its simplified methodology, probabilistic analysis enhances the confidence in the modeling results, even with the inherent simplifications of zero-dimensional modeling. This added layer of analysis helps to account for uncertainties, improving the overall reliability of the model despite its simplicity.																			1364-8152	1873-6726				AUG	2025	192								106593	10.1016/j.envsoft.2025.106593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2025.106593													WOS:001530610300001

Utilizing monitoring data from 1060 surface water state-controlled sections collected in 2021, we assessed water quality using both single-factor and comprehensive pollution index methods. The results indicate an overall improvement in the basin's water quality: 94.4% of sites met excellent Class III standards, 4.4% met Class IV, 1.1% met Class V, and only 0.1% were below Class V according to the single-factor evaluation. The comprehensive pollution index showed that 98% of sites were at qualified levels, 1.2% at basically qualified levels, and 0.8% were polluted, with total phosphorus identified as the primary contaminant. Spatial analysis revealed that nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were higher in rivers and lakes compared to reservoirs, and higher in tributaries than in the main stream. Temporally, dissolved oxygen and ammonia nitrogen levels were lower, while permanganate index and total phosphorus levels were higher during the flood season compared to the non-flood season. The study recommends intensifying total phosphorus pollution control in critical tributaries and regions to further reduce the river's pollution load.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				AUG	2025	52	4					830	841		10.1134/S0097807824606599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807824606599													WOS:001532299200003

Moreover, the accuracy of extracting glacier boundaries from a single remote sensing image (RSIs) is often influenced by seasonal snow, clouds, shadows, and frozen lakes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel model for extracting the non-debris-covered areas of glaciers (NDCAG) from RSIs, termed GlacierSTR-UNet. This model enhances information flow and overall performance by embedding the Swin Transformer (ST) as an encoder into a U-shaped architecture and reduces training time and improves gradient handling by incorporating the ResNet block in the decoder. We deploy the GlacierSTR-UNet model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently generate multiple NDCAG results from RSIs taken at different periods. A pixel-by-pixel synthesis algorithm is then applied to aggregate the multiple NDCAG extraction results, producing the final NDCAG. Accuracy assessments indicate that GlacierSTR-UNet achieves an overall accuracy of 0.8817, and the relative deviation between automatically extracted and manually interpreted NDCAG remains within 2 %. Finally, we obtain the NDCAG datasets for the periods of 2015/2016 and 2022/2023 in HighMountain Asia, revealing a reduction of 4,185.12 +/- 7,870.96 km2 in NDCAG from 2015/2016 to 2022/2023. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently and accurately extracting NDCAG, highlighting its potential for monitoring glacier changes and supporting glacier inventory efforts.																			1569-8432	1872-826X				AUG	2025	142								104680	10.1016/j.jag.2025.104680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2025.104680													WOS:001517637800001

Food Habits of Nonnative Smallmouth Bass in Coeur d'Alene Lake, Idaho	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) has been widely introduced beyond its native distribution where interactions with other organisms are largely unknown. We examined the food habits of Smallmouth Bass in Coeur d'Alene Lake, Idaho. Smallmouth Bass were sampled monthly from March 2012 to May 2013 using short duration (1-2 hr sets) gill netting and electrofishing. In total, food habits were evaluated from 904 Smallmouth Bass varying in total length from 39 to 492 mm using gastric lavage. Diet composition varied by season and age. Smallmouth Bass less than 100 mm had diets dominated by invertebrates, particularly Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Diptera. Fishes were increasingly important in the diet of Smallmouth Bass longer than 100 mm. Interestingly, crayfish (Decapoda) were virtually absent in Smallmouth Bass stomachs; only eight Smallmouth Bass had crayfish in their diet. Native vertebrates were also rare in Smallmouth Bass diets. Rather, kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka), a nonnative species, was generally the most commonly consumed fish prey item (present in 5-15% of Smallmouth Bass across seasons). Kokanee contributed the highest percentage of total energy (approximately 45% of all energy) of any prey item. Results of this study suggest that native fishes of conservation concern are a minor component of Smallmouth Bass diets and that kokanee is important in meeting the energy demands of nonnative Smallmouth Bass. Further research on the distribution and abundance of crayfish in the system and on the population-level effects of Smallmouth Bass predation on kokanee would be insightful and help guide management actions in Coeur d'Alene Lake and similar systems in western North America.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	2025	98	2					99	115		10.3955/046.098.0202	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.098.0202													WOS:001576987900002

During the open water period, net longwave radiation is projected to increase by <^>0.4 Wm-2 per decade. Annually, net and shortwave radiation are projected to increase (<^>1 and 1.3 Wm-2 per decade), and longwave radiation is projected to decrease (0.4 Wm-2 per decade). The projected trends show that the largest net shortwave radiation increases are expected to occur in May and June, whereas net longwave radiation is projected to have the largest decrease in July. The role of lakes in the regional energy balance is increasing because of the lengthening open water season through increases in lake evaporative losses and warmer water temperatures, which favour invasive species and will negatively impact cold-water fish and organisms that are well adapted to ice-covered conditions.

The XGBoost technique was used to construct predictive models for chlorophyll-a concentrations in the lake and its associated rivers. Two datasets were assembled for the lake and its rivers to achieve these objectives, leveraging 13 environmental parameters as predictors. The study also investigated the connection between chlorophyll-a and the observed environmental parameters using a multivariate analysis, which show the spatio-temporal and seasonal variations of the parameters. The findings reveal that the observed TRIX values ranged from 3 to 5 in Ichkeul Lake, indicative of waters spanning from moderate to poor quality, while in Ichkeul Rivers, these values fluctuated between 4 and 7, signifying eutrophic conditions with a high trophic level. The XGBoost models, however, reveal a pivotal insight: the most influential factors affecting chlorophyll-a variations are nutrients and temperature. This discovery underscores the potential for developing a more streamlined model for this variable.

Study focus: To quantify the dynamic transformations among groundwater, river water, and precipitation at the basin scale, we integrated a fixed-covariate MixSIAR isotope mixing model, a structural equation model (SEM), and hydrogeological structural analysis. This integrated framework allowed us to systematically characterize the spatiotemporal transformation patterns and their driving mechanisms among the three water sources. New hydrological insights for the region: Both delta 2H and delta 18O values of precipitation and river water showed clear seasonal enrichment during the rainy season and depletion during the non-rainy season, with shallow groundwater exhibiting stronger seasonal isotopic responses than deeper groundwater. Model selection results identified "Section & Date" as the optimal fixed covariates for groundwater and river-water mixtures, while "Date" alone was optimal for precipitation. Under these optimal configurations, upper-reach river water during the rainy season was primarily recharged by groundwater (82.84 %) and precipitation (17.16 %), while in the non-rainy season, river water (80.88 %) and groundwater (19.12 %) in the lower basin were recycled to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration and contributed to local precipitation. SEM analysis revealed that meteorological factors (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological factors (runoff and groundwater level) were the dominant drivers of isotope dynamics and source partitioning, whereas ecological variables had relatively limited influence.																				2214-5818				AUG	2025	60								102597	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102597													WOS:001538286600001

Fluid sediment on the surface is gradually receiving attention due to its low density. Here, a typical large shallow lake, the Taihu Lake, was selected to conduct on temporal and spatial variation in surface fluid sediment. Through collecting sediment column samples in different lake areas during four seasons, the surface fluid sediment properties were analyzed. The results indicated that the northwest lake area was covered with fluid sediment in four seasons. And the fluid sediment coverage areas in January and October were larger than that in April and July. In order to understand the changes in sediment structure, we calculated the proportions of sediment components and measured the sediment particle size distribution and organic matters contents. According to the pairwise comparisons and structural equation model (SEM) analysis, it can be concluded that sediment particle size, density, and organic matters jointly affected sediment stability. And sediment D50 was the main driving force affecting sediment yield shear stress (tau y). Then sediment critical shear stress (tau c) was calculated combined with tau y to clarify the sediment suspension capacity. Overall, the results can deepen our understanding of the fluid sediment properties in lakes, and help with the restoration and management of lake sediment.					zhou, xinyue/MCX-6183-2025; Jiang, Helong/H-2709-2015; Wang, Changhui/I-5055-2014														0301-4797	1095-8630				AUG	2025	390								126283	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.126283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.126283								40543369					WOS:001519084100003

High-resolution InSAR regional soil water storage mapping above permafrost	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The hydrology of thawing permafrost affects the fate of the vast amount of permafrost carbon, due to its controls on waterlogging, redox status, and transport. However, regional mapping of soil water storage in the soil layer that experiences the annual freeze-thaw cycle above permafrost, known as the active layer, remains a formidable challenge over remote Arctic regions. This study shows that interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations can be used to estimate the amount of soil water originating from the active-layer seasonal thaw. Our ALOS InSAR results, validated by in situ observations, show that the equivalent thickness of the soil water that experiences the annual freeze-thaw cycle ranges from 0 to 75 cm in a 60kmx100km area near the Toolik Field Station on the North Slope of Alaska. Notably, the spatial distribution of the soil water correlates with surface topography and land vegetation cover types. We found that pixel-mismatching of the topographic map and radar images is the primary error source in the Toolik ALOS InSAR data. The amount of pixel misregistration, the local slope, and the InSAR perpendicular baseline influence the observed errors in InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) distance measurements. For most of the study area with a percent slope of less than 5 %, the LOS error from pixel misregistration is less than 1 cm, translating to less than 14 cm of error in the soil water estimates.

Accurate delineation and monitoring of water bodies are essential for effective water resource management. However, existing datasets primarily focus on large water bodies on an annual scale and often overlooking smaller ones. To address this gap, an integrated solution of water body mapping and long-term spatiotemporal variation analysis with two maps per year for the whole region of Hubei province are proposed. The solution adopted Double Multiplication Attention Module UNet (DMAM-UNet) model to improve the accuracy of water mapping, with mean overall accuracy (OA) of 96.83%. Notably, the model attained an OA of 98.27% for micro rivers as narrow as 50 metres. Landsat ETM/OLI/TIRS surface reflectance imagery was used to generate annual 30 m resolution water body maps for both the dry and wet seasons from 1991 to 2022. Results show significant seasonal variability in surface water. During the wet season, water area fluctuations ranged from -1,500 km2 to 2,000 km2. Notably, significant surface water loss was observed in cities such as Wuhan and Shennongjia, with reductions of 93.01% and 18.55%, respectively. Furthermore, water body dynamics and their driving factors were analysed at the administrative level. Precipitation was found to be strongly positively correlated with water area, while temperature showed a negative correlation with total water area but a positive correlation with stable water area. The impacts of urban population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on water area varied across different cities.

These reservoirs are crucial for water supply and management, and understanding the invisible water losses they incur is vital for assessing surface water availability. Study focus: This study reconstructs the monthly area series of 4863 inland reservoirs in China from 1988 to 2018 utilizing the latest reservoir database and water enhancement algorithm. Reservoir evaporation is quantified based on the reconstructed area series and a lake evaporation algorithm based on Penman equation and accounting for heat storage and fetch effect. Long-term and seasonal trends are analyzed, and driving factors behind these trends are identified using a detrending method. New hydrological insights for the region: The total area of China's reservoirs increased at a rate of 132.68 km2/year, with a cumulative growth of 2880.7 km2 in existing reservoir. A significant negative correlation was observed between seasonal variations in reservoir area and precipitation. The long-term average evaporation volume from reservoirs was 18.55 x 109 m3 /year, with an increasing trend of 1.46 x 108 m3 /year and an evaporation rate increase trend of 0.0045 mm/ day per year, primarily driven by temperature. Seasonal evaporation rates lagged one month behind temperature trends, peaking in September. These findings provide essential data support for reservoir management and water resource planning, offering insights into addressing water supply and sustainability challenges under future climate changes.

F.; Melack, John M.; MacIntyre, Sally			Methane (CH4) oxidation in flooded forests of the amazon basin	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Methane oxidation has been observed in a wide range of aquatic environments worldwide, and measurements are rare in tropical floodplains. The Amazon floodplain is one of the largest tropical wetlands with seasonally flooded forests representing up to 80% of the area of aquatic habitats in the lowland Amazon. Hence, we measured methane oxidation rates (Mox) in two different flooded forests (v & aacute;rzea, in white waters; igap & oacute;, in black waters) and evaluated effects of dissolved oxygen and CH4 concentrations, and water temperature on methane oxidation. We found high Mox in near-bottom waters associated with high CH4 concentrations (1.0-2.4 mu M) and hypoxia, with volumetric rates ranging from 9.8 to 73 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in the igap & oacute;, and from 2.3 to 101.4 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in the v & aacute;rzea. Depth integrated Mox rates ranged from 177 to 213 mg C m(-2) d(-1) for the igap & oacute;, and 159 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the v & aacute;rzea, and were one to two orders of magnitude higher than CH4 fluxes from water to the atmosphere, emphasizing the important role of Mox in attenuating CH4 emissions from tropical flooded forests. The present study contributes to understanding of the complex processes involved in carbon dynamics on tropical floodplains.

While microclimate monitoring is a recognized preventive conservation tool, its role in detecting surface-specific moisture risks remains underexplored. This study evaluates the relationship between indoor microclimate fluctuations and surface moisture dynamics across 13 historical sites in Northern Italy (Lake Como, Valtellina, Valposchiavo), encompassing diverse masonry typologies and environmental conditions. High-resolution sensors recorded temperature and relative humidity for a minimum of 13 months, and eight indicators-including dew point depression, critical temperature-humidity zones, and damp effect indices-were analyzed to assess the moisture risks. The results demonstrate that multivariate microclimate data could effectively predict humidity accumulation. The key findings reveal the impact of seasonal ventilation, thermal inertia, and localized air stagnation on moisture distribution, with unheated alpine sites showing the highest condensation risk. The study highlights the need for integrated monitoring approaches, combining dew point analysis, mixing ratio stability, and buffering performance, to enable early risk detection and targeted conservation strategies. These insights bridge the gap between environmental monitoring and surface moisture diagnostics in porous heritage materials.

J	Yin, SJ; Li, YH; Zhu, Y; Miao, GH; Ai, J				Yin, Shujing; Li, Yanhong; Zhu, Yu; Miao, Guanghua; Ai, Jiang			Deciphering seasonal carbon and nitrogen release dynamics in biogeomorphic successions of the arid Lake Ebinur, Northwest China	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												As potential sources of carbon and nitrogen release, arid saline lakes have undergone drastic ecological changes over the past decades due to soil freeze-thaw processes. These changes have inevitably altered the soil carbon and nitrogen release and sequestration. However, the mechanistic processes governing carbon and nitrogen dynamics in response to ecological changes across the biogeomorphic succession of salt lakes remain poorly understood. This study used the static chamber gas chromatography method and partial least squares structural equation modelling to analyse fluctuations in CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes in surface soil layer along a biogeomorphic succession comprising lake wetland (LW), marsh wetland (MW), salt marsh wetland (SW), and nonwetland (NW) areas. Freeze-thaw cycles considerably increased the soil carbon and nitrogen release in LW and MW. As the biogeomorphic transition progressed to SW and NW, CO2 release decreased by 32.46 % and 66.99 %, CH4 by 90.28 % and 107.31 %, and N2O by 46.24 % and 86.20 %, suggesting a transition toward a carbon sink. The MW acted as the strongest emission source, with annual average emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O of 1463.895 x 109 mg center dot m- 2 center dot h- 1, 460.935 x 106 mg center dot m- 2 center dot h- 1, and 722.355 x 106 mg center dot m- 2 center dot h- 1, respectively, mainly driven by the synergistic changes in soil temperature (ST) and soil water content (SWC). During the thawing and melting periods, the emission from MW was higher, but it changed to a carbon sink during the freezing period, associated with the suppression of carbon emissions by low temperatures and the physical sequestration of some carbon. Further evidence showed that the synergistic increase of SWC and ST during the melting period enhanced oxygen permeability, activating methane-oxidising bacteria activity, allowing LW and SW to act as methane sinks (-0.142 mg center dot m- 2 center dot h- 1 and - 0.081 mg center dot m- 2 center dot h- 1, respectively). Compared to subtropical monsoon and subfreezing climate zones, CH4 emissions from MW of arid Lake Ebinur responded rapidly to freeze-thaw cycles, with a peak release during the thawing period mainly due to the intense fluctuations in SWC and the combined action of soil content (SC). This study establishes a dual-focused framework that elucidates seasonal dynamics of carbon and nitrogen release in arid regions while providing scalable solutions for global GHG modelling.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2025	90								103341	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103341		JUL 2025											WOS:001544296300002

Dynamic seasonal wind speeds are an important component in this climate that requires further study. Using 10-m wind data from ERA5-Land, this study employs remote teleconnection indices and local climate features to predict low-level wind speeds using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning. The model for monthly winds achieves high accuracy, with an R-2 of 0.96 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.12 m/s-1. The Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) analysis reveals that local climate variables, including the proximity to the nearest Great Lake, surface roughness, and surface temperature, are the most influential predictors and are most important in the model. Teleconnections such as the El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation play minor roles. This study provides a new multiscale perspective on wind speed characteristics, drivers, and insights into the region's wind energy potential.

Nineteen limnological parameters were assessed seasonally at 14 sampling sites throughout the reservoir. Water variables showed significant (p < 0.05) spatial and seasonal variations where seasons had more impact on physicochemical variables. The calculated Arithmetic Weighted WQI value determined the reservoir water to be of 'good' water quality, especially in the pre- and post-monsoon period. However, during monsoon, increased turbidity was found to be a single potent factor for drastic deviation in WQI, rated as 'poor to very poor' water quality. Overall, the entire reservoir was in a mesotrophic state, with Carlson's Trophic State Index (CTSI) ranging between 40.44 and 50.95. The insignificant (p > 0.05) spatio-temporal variation of CTSI value, which indicates the biological productivity of the reservoir, maintains its homogeneity. The land use land cover map was created for the reservoir with an overall accuracy Kappa index value of 0.85. The present study also evaluated the evolution of eutrophication in relation to Chl a using the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and BEST Biota--Environmental Matching (BIO-ENV). Our models suggest that water variables (dissolved oxygen, PO43-, transparency, and electrical conductivity) were the best explained variables for deviating Chl a in reservoir water. Furthermore, the BIO-ENV model suggests that other factors (geographic and climatic) are equally responsible for the local evolution of eutrophication in the reservoir, including allochthonous inputs mainly by feeder river.

Observational Study of the Lightning Activity of "Relámpago del Catatumbo" From 2014 to 2024	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The "Rel & aacute;mpago del Catatumbo" is a striking phenomenon that occurs over Lake Maracaibo, where the most intense lightning activity on the planet takes place. In this work, we extend the study of lightning activity in Lake Maracaibo and its surroundings, evaluating the period from 2014 to 2024. The results show that the hourly distributions of lightning activity are correlated with the variations of deep convective events in the region; the seasonal variations in lightning strikes are correlated with the monthly variations in the mean water temperature of Lake Maracaibo. These findings suggest that the Lake may be providing the water vapor for the development of storm systems that form in the region. It was found that the diurnal and monthly variations of the lightning activity have not changed substantially over the years, as these variations are, very similar to those found in the period 2005-2010 by B & uuml;rgesser et al. (2012), . The interannual analysis of variations in lightning activity suggests a general increase in the stroke number per year per km2 across the entire study area (latitudes [6-12] N and longitudes [69-75] W). However, the lightning activity over the Lake exhibits high variability, preventing the identification of a systematic trend.

Utilizing the SCORPAN model framework, we systematically combined diverse remote sensing datasets and innovatively established nine distinct strategies for soil salinity prediction. We employed four machine learning models-Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Geographical Gaussian Process Regression (GGPR) for modeling, prediction, and accuracy comparison, with the objective of achieving high-precision salinity mapping under complex vegetation cover conditions. The results reveal that among the models evaluated across the nine strategies, the SVR model demonstrated the highest accuracy, followed by RF. Notably, under Strategy IX, the SVR model achieved the best predictive performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.62 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.38 g/kg. Analysis based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values and feature importance indicated that Vegetation Type Factors contributed significantly and consistently to the model's performance, maintaining higher importance than traditional salinity indices and playing a dominant role. In summary, this research successfully developed a comprehensive, high-resolution soil salinity mapping framework for the Dongying region by integrating multi-source remote sensing data and employing diverse predictive strategies alongside machine learning models. The findings highlight the potential of Vegetation Type Factors to enhance large-scale soil salinity monitoring, providing robust scientific evidence and technical support for sustainable land resource management, agricultural optimization, ecological protection, efficient water resource utilization, and policy formulation.

This study adopts such an integrated methodology to discern areas of severe erosion, understand its relationship with land use and management, and capture local communities' perspectives on erosion causes, indicators, and mitigation measures. The study was done in the 211 km2 Fota-Gumara catchment, an erosion-prone area in Northwest Ethiopia. Utilizing the land degradation surveillance framework, 150 plots were observed, and insights from 75 randomly selected farmers were synthesized. Catchment-scale soil erosion susceptibility prediction employed an expert-based, multi-criteria evaluation model, validated against field observations. Findings revealed that 23.5% of the catchment was subjected to severe erosion, mainly by sheet and rill erosion on steep slopes under cropland or shrubland and valley bottoms with gullies. Local communities identified communal grazing land and cropland as vulnerable, attributing erosion to various causes, while they overlooked the erosion severity of shrubland and the heightened erosion susceptibility caused by conventional tillage. They perceived severe erosion in sandy-textured soils and during the middle of the rainy season. Crop yield reduction, linked to soil fertility decline and gullies, emerged as a significant concern. Perceptions about soil erosion trends were different among male and female participants. A knowledge-implementation gap in soil and water conservation practices, compounded by challenges like labor shortages, was identified.

The study encompasses nine specific applications across 12 satellite scenes, including the validation of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), optical water type classification, estimation of phycocyanin concentration, detection of macrophytes, and characterization of reflectance for lake ice/snow coverage. Rrs validation, which was performed using in situ measurements and Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 as references, showed a level of agreement with Spectral Angle < 16 degrees. Hyperspectral imagery successfully captured fine-scale spatial and spectral features not detectable by multispectral sensors, in particular it was possible to identify cyanobacterial pigments and optical variations driven by seasonal and meteorological dynamics. Through the combined use of in situ observations, the study can serve as a starting point for the use of hyperspectral data in northern freshwater systems, offering new insights into ecological processes. Given the increasing global concern over freshwater ecosystem health, this work provides a transferable framework for leveraging new-generation hyperspectral missions to enhance water quality monitoring on a global scale.					; Kuusk, Joel/E-8418-2016; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Kangro, Kersti/D-8972-2015; Alikas, Krista/ABE-1431-2020; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015	Greife, A.

J	Leppäranta, M				Lepparanta, Matti			Lake ice melting, deterioration, and break-up	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH												The time scale of lake ice decay is one month for half metre thick seasonal ice. Field data are limited due to weak ice cover, remote sensing methods have problems with co-presence of ice and liquid water, and modelling suffers from lack of reference data and from parameterization problems of albedo and light transmittance. Lake ice decay is a chaotic process where thermal, radiative and mechanical processes drive the deterioration. Melting at the ice surface and bottom decrease ice thickness while internal melting increases the porosity and decreases the strength of ice. Porosity needs to be included in realistic models of melting. Lake ice decay may end at breakage at critical porosity. In ice-off climatology, a zeroth order heat flux needs to be added to the positive degree-days of air temperature to account for the role of the latitude and time. The climate sensitivity of ice decay and ice-off is in the maximum annual ice thickness, snow accumulation on ice, air temperature, and solar radiation.																			0022-1686	1814-2079				2025 JUL 26	2025										10.1080/00221686.2025.2516779	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00221686.2025.2516779		JUL 2025											WOS:001536151000001

However, the trait-mediated pathways through which hydrology regulates biogeochemical processes remain poorly understood. We used a trait-based field survey in 90 quadrats across 5 short and 2 tall dominant plant communities along 16 shore-to-water transects in the Dongting Lake floodplain wetlands, China. Data on integrative hydrological parameters (cumulative inundation depth, mean inundation depth, and total inundation days), plant community metrics (height, biomass, and diversity), and soil properties (bulk density, water content, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and inorganic nitrogen) were obtained to investigate how plant traits mediate the influence of hydrology on soil nutrient dynamics. Short plant communities exhibited strong correlations between hydrological parameters, soil properties, and plant traits, whereas these correlations were weak in tall plant communities. Variance partitioning showed that soil physical properties explained the largest proportion of nutrient variability (29 % in tall communities and 19 % in short communities). In short plant communities, high inundation stimulated a rapid increase in plant height and aboveground biomass, which decreased the accumulation of soil total nitrogen and phosphorus, thereby attenuating the direct effects of hydrology on soil nutrient dynamics. Conversely, in tall plant communities, inundation-induced reductions in plant height and species richness decreased nutrient uptake by plants and amplified the influence of hydrology on soil nutrients. Therefore, plant community height is a robust mechanistic indicator linking hydrological disturbances to biogeochemical functions in floodplain wetlands. These insights inform management strategies to enhance wetland resilience, such as selecting plant assemblages with optimal height traits to buffer nutrient loss under projected climate-driven hydroperiod shifts. Consequently, incorporating plant height into predictive models of nutrient feedback under climate-driven alterations in floodplain wetlands, while providing a trait-based framework for designing restoration strategies that stabilize soil nutrient cycling in floodplain wetlands.

Aquatic vegetation is widely implemented in urban water management for ecological restoration and landscape construction, while its spatial configuration and planting density critically regulate the CO2 flux (FCO2) at the water-air interface. This study examines spatiotemporal variations and environmental drivers of FCO2 across different vegetation patterns in the Qingshangang (QSG) River and Lihu Lake (LH) continuum. The FCO2 exhibited pronounced seasonality, with significantly higher emissions during the wet season (QSG: 74.76 +/- 61.95 mmol/m(2)/d; LH: 62.81 +/- 39.08 mmol/m(2)/d) compared to those during the dry season (QSG: 40.13 +/- 44.89 mmol/m(2)/d; LH: 9.41 +/- 15.02 mmol/m(2)/d). Structural equation model (SEM) identified dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH as key direct controls of FCO2, while dissolved organic matter (DOM) contributed indirectly. Sites with dense emergent macrophytes exhibited significantly higher FCO2 levels, highlighting vegetation density as a primary factor shaping spatial heterogeneity in CO2 emissions. Our findings emphasize the need to consider vegetation spatial distribution in urban aquatic ecosystem design and management for greenhouse gas mitigation strategies.

This study assessed the resilience of indigenous sheep and goats that drink naturally saline water from Lake Basaka, focusing on their physiological and biochemical responses as stress indicators under pastoral system conditions. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a random systematic sample of 260 healthy local adult sheep and goats from 50 households for this study. The current finding revealed that physicochemical analysis of Lake Basaka water showed high salinity, with electrical conductivity at 3,992.53 mu S/cm and sodium levels at 1,180.69 mg/L, significantly higher than those in freshwater (641.53 mu S/cm and 35.28 mg/L, respectively; p < 0.05). The physiological data indicated that goats and sheep drinking saline water had higher rectal temperatures (39.3 degrees C vs. 39.1 degrees C; p < 0.05) and pulse rates (85.1 vs. 83.2 beats/min; p < 0.05) compared to animals drinking freshwater. Hematologic results revealed elevated hemoglobin levels (13.74 g/dL vs. 9.48 g/dL; p < 0.05) and red blood cell counts (11.51 x 10(6)/mu L vs. 9.28 x 10(6)/mu L; p < 0.05) in animals consuming saline water. Biochemical profiles showed decreased glucose (60.07 mg/dL vs. 71.33 mg/dL; p < 0.05) and cholesterol levels (54.13 mg/dL vs. 64.93 mg/dL; p < 0.05), along with increased urea (75.18 mg/dL vs. 68.96 mg/dL; p < 0.05) and creatinine (3.48 mg/dL vs. 2.68 mg/dL; p < 0.05). Although physiological and blood parameters were higher in the saline water group, most values remained within normal ranges, indicating the animals' adaptive capacity. However, prolonged exposure to saline water may impact their long-term productivity and health. The study recommends further research on seasonal changes, interspecies resilience, and sustainable water management strategies to enhance livestock resilience and productivity in dryland regions.

The hydrological regime of Poyang Lake was altered following the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on the Yangtze River. We employed seasonal-trend decomposition based on Loess and wavelet coherence to quantify nonstationary responses of water levels and water quality parameters-total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and nitrogen-phosphorus ratios (N:P), and stratified the analysis into preTGD (1988-2002) and post-TGD (2003-2019) periods. Our research demonstrated a decline in post-TGD water levels with reduced seasonal variability, while TN, TP, and N:P exhibited increasing trends accompanied by amplified seasonal fluctuations. Resonance period analysis revealed water level with both TN and N:P dynamics shared long-term periodicities (2-4 years), whereas TP demonstrated seasonal-scale coherence predominantly during post-TGD period. Variations in resonance periods reflected changes in pollutant sources and retention times within the lake system. Seasonal non-stationarity analysis identified contrasting phase relationships: the water level demonstrated a positive correlation with TN and TP during dry periods while transitioning to negative relationships in the post-TGD, whereas water level and N:P ratios correlations similarly reversed during recession period. These phase shifts diminish ecosystem stability and heighten susceptibility to algal bloom events. This investigation compares pre- and post-TGD nonstationary hydrology and water quality dynamics in Poyang Lake, offering valuable insights for optimizing large-scale hydraulic project scheduling to enhance ecological sustainability through improved water resource management strategies.

Eutrophication and Warming Drive Algal Community Shifts in Synchronised Time Series of Experimental Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Lake ecosystems are increasingly impacted by eutrophication and climate change. Whole-lake experiments have provided ecosystem-scale insights into the effects of freshwater stressors, yet these are constrained to the duration of monitoring programmes. Here, we leveraged multidecadal monitoring records and century-scale paleogenetic reconstructions for experimentally fertilised and unmanipulated lakes in the IISD Experimental Lakes Area of northwestern Ontario, Canada, to evaluate the responses of algal communities to nutrient and air temperature variation. We first validated the paleogenetic analysis of sediment DNA by demonstrating the synchrony of algal community changes with monitoring records. Algal communities underwent significant compositional shifts across experimental nutrient loading regimes and climate periods, with baseline assemblages informed by paleogenetics. Nonlinear regression modelling of algal community change in monitoring and paleogenetic time series showed the expected response that nutrients were strong drivers in fertilised lakes. Paleogenetic records reflected the century-scale impacts of climate warming and its combined effects with eutrophication, previously underestimated by monitoring. The synergy between eutrophication and warming points to eutrophic priming of the food web to respond to rising temperatures. Overall, the paleogenetic integration of algal diversity across habitats and seasons enables the detection of slow-acting climate change on lake ecosystems increasingly altered by nutrient pollution.

The main objective of this study was to report the current physico-chemical and biological conditions of these water bodies before any large-scale development projects kick off-like potash extraction in Dallol, fossil fuel exploration under Lake Yardi, and hydropower generation through a network of dams along the Gibe-Omo River. We used standard methods for assessing freshwater environments, which included on-site physical and chemical measurements, lab analyses of water quality, and identifying various life forms such as plankton, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, and fish samples. The results showed that all sites, except for the Dallol Streams, had typical freshwater characteristics, like low salinity and a variety of life forms. However, the Dallol Streams were marked by extreme heat, high salinity, and scarce rainfall. All four ecosystems were found to be receiving a significant influx of external nutrients, especially during the wet season, which has led to the spread of invasive species like water hyacinth in Lake Yardi, calmer parts of the Gibe-Omo River, and Lake Turkana. With ongoing and expected pressures from deforestation, dam building, human settlements, and waste disposal, these ecosystems are increasingly at risk of degradation. Therefore, it is important to develop practical policy measures in partnership with stakeholders and to carry out regular environmental impact assessments to safeguard the long-term sustainability of these essential natural resources.

This study integrates Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery with in situ water quality data from Peru's National Water Observatory to assess spatiotemporal dynamics in 31 physicochemical parameters between 2018 and 2024. We evaluated 40 empirical algorithms developed globally for Sentinel-2 and tested their transferability to this ultraoligotrophic Andean system. The results revealed limited predictive accuracy, underscoring the need for localized calibration. Subsequently, we developed and validated site-specific models for ammoniacal nitrogen, electrical conductivity, major ions, and trace metals, achieving high predictive performance during the rainy season (R2 up to 0.95). Notably, the study identifies consistent seasonal correlations-such as between total copper and ammoniacal nitrogen-and strong spectral responses in Band 1, linked to runoff dynamics. These findings highlight the potential of combining public monitoring data with remote sensing to enable scalable, cost-effective assessment of water quality in optically complex, high-Andean lakes. The study provides a replicable framework for integrating national datasets into operational monitoring and environmental policy.

Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) inputs complicate DOM dynamics, altering its bioavailability and persistence, yet the molecular drivers of refractory DOM (RDOM) formation in human-altered river systems remain unresolved. Here, we integrate Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), 13C stable isotope analysis (delta 13CDOC) analysis, and advanced optical characterization to unravel DOM sources and RDOM transformation pathways in the anthropogenically stressed Fen River basin. Longitudinal analyses revealed increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (2.18-10.37 mg/L), RDOC concentrations (0.07-7.43 mg/L) and S-containing DOM contributions (64.9 +/- 4.1% to 69.6 +/- 10.1%) along the river continuum, tightly coupled with sewage-derived inputs. S-enriched CHOS compounds emerged as robust molecular markers of RDOM production, dominated by aliphatic structures, hydrophobic units (HUs), and humic acids (HAs). This study deciphers the molecular architecture of DOM persistence in human-impacted rivers, identifying CHOS as both tracers and enablers of RDOM formation. By linking sewage inputs to S-mediated DOM stabilization, these findings provide actionable insights for mitigating legacy organic pollution in freshwater ecosystems under intensifying anthropogenic and climatic pressure.

However, it faces significant One Health challenges, notably urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis, diseases transmitted by Bulinus and Biomphalaria snails, respectively. Climate, topography, environmental and demographic drivers influence snail habitat suitability and distribution, potentially increasing schistosomiasis risks for communities dependent on agriculture, fishing, and water-related livelihoods. Methods: This study applied ecological ensemble modeling (Random Forest, XGBoost, and MaxEnt) to identify key drivers of habitat suitability, assessing current and future climate scenarios under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, and overlaying habitat suitability and population density to quantify human exposure risks associated with Biomphalaria and Bulinus snails. Snail occurrence data were sourced from biodiversity databases, field surveys, and literature. Predictor variables included climatic (temperature, precipitation), topographic (elevation, slope, proximity to water bodies), and environmental (vegetation index, soil composition) features. Findings: For Bulinus, habitat suitability increased with higher precipitation and elevation but decreased with rising vegetation index NDVI, silt content, and temperature seasonality as key drivers. Similarly, Biomphalaria suitability improved with higher precipitation and elevation but declined with increasing NDVI, slope, and temperature seasonality. Currently, Biomphalaria and Bulinus are primarily concentrated around Lake Victoria, with 17 % and 14 % of the area suitable for their habitat, a figure projected to increase to 21 % and 18 % by 2050. By 2050, medium-risk zones for intestinal schistosomiasis are expected to almost double from 13 % to 22 %, while those for urogenital schistosomiasis are projected to more than double from 8 % to 18 % of the total area. This study predicts a rising schistosomiasis risk across the LVB, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions. A proactive One Health approach, integrating environmental management, strategic disease control, and policy adaptation, is vital to reducing future risks and protecting vulnerable communities.

Based on sediment nutrient gradient experiments and three-year seasonal monitoring of macrophyte communities in Erhai Lake, southwest China, spanning pre- and post-algal bloom periods, we explored how species diversity and a key community functional trait (stoichiometric homeostasis) affect multiple dimensions (temporal stability, resistance, resilience and recovery) and facets (function, composition, diversity and functional trait) of stability of macrophyte communities following algal blooms. Generally, we found that species diversity and stoichiometric homeostasis of phosphorus (HP) had positive relationships with functional and compositional temporal stability, resistance and recovery, indicating that ecosystems with high species diversity and community HP are more resistant and stable in response to external algal bloom disturbances. However, species diversity and community HP had no positive or even negative relationships with resilience, suggesting that high biodiversity with high-HP species-dominated ecosystems is not beneficial for the rapid recovery from disturbances, probably due to the slow growth and reproduction rate of high-HP species. In addition, we found strong positive correlations between functional and compositional stability across the four dimensions of stability, while the stability of species diversity and the key functional trait (HP) exhibited complex relationships, implying the difficulty of optimizing multiple dimensions and facets of stability simultaneously. Synthesis. Our work demonstrated that macrophyte species diversity and community HP are critical in determining the multiple dimensions and facets of stability in response to disturbances, which provides new insights for predicting the responses of macrophyte-dominated lake ecosystems to the current increasing frequency of algal blooms.

J	Feng, TT; Ma, XY; Liu, XM				Feng, Tiantian; Ma, Xinyu; Liu, Xiaomin			Volumetric evolution of supraglacial lakes in southwestern Greenland using ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2	CRYOSPHERE												Surface meltwater runoff is a major factor affecting the trends and interannual variations in the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. During the melting season, surface meltwater accumulates in low-lying areas, forming supraglacial lakes (SGLs). Quantitatively characterizing the spatial and temporal changes in the volume of SGLs can provide further insights into the surface mass balance changes of the ice sheet during the melt season. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the volume of SGLs by combining optical imagery (Sentinel-2) and satellite altimetry data (ICESat-2). First, the area of SGLs is extracted using a random forest (RF) model based on spectral features from Sentinel-2 imagery, achieving an intersection over union (IoU) of 90.20 % compared to manually delineated lake extents. Second, the depth of SGLs along the ICESat-2 profile is detected using the kernel density analysis method. Finally, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model constructs the nonlinear relationship between the reflectance ratio from Sentinel-2 imagery and the depth of SGLs detected by ICESat-2 data. The accuracy of depth inversion based on the MLP model surpasses traditional empirical formula methods, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.42 m. The trained MLP model is then used to estimate the depth over the entire lake areas. The proposed volume estimation method for SGLs is applied to southwestern Greenland, capturing the volumetric evolution of SGLs throughout the entire melt season of 2022. The results reveal significant variations in the distribution, area, depth, and volume of SGLs throughout the melt season. Initially, SGLs form along the coastlines and later spread inland, expanding in both area and depth. The maximum total volume of SGLs is reached on 1 August, amounting to 9.30 x 108 m3. Afterward, SGLs above 1200 m continue to increase in volume, while SGLs below 1200 m begin to decrease. In late August, as the melt season draws to a close, SGLs diminish and retreat to coastal regions, with a notable reduction in volume. Additionally, according to the evolution characteristics of SGLs at different elevations, SGLs above 800 m exhibit a similar evolution pattern.

This is particularly true with respect to substantial and lasting water level fluctuations that occur on seasonal and decadal time scales that differ temporally from shorter term tidal fluctuations and greatly exceed long-term oceanic sea level rise. Since the late 1990s, the Great Lakes basin has experienced record-breaking high and low water levels as well as more frequent and intense storms. This combination of factors has led to changes to these nearshore environments and stimulated new and exciting coastal research characterizing and quantifying these changes and offering new insights into Great Lakes coastal processes. Studies in this special section address these unique coastal landscapes shaped by both natural forces (e.g., ice dynamics, waves, and fluctuating lake levels) and human influences (armoring, coastal structures, sediment nourishment, and policy interventions). The findings shared in this collection provide actionable knowledge for anticipating change, mitigating risk, and building long-term resilience while calling for adaptive management frameworks to foster proactive, equitable stewardship of the Great Lakes shorelines.

Lake water and foreshore sand samples were collected weekly from three swim coves at Maumee Bay Park Beach (OH) during the recreational swim season to assess the accumulation and persistence of MC in foreshore sands. Enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent-assay (ELISA) analysis showed that 14 % of lake water samples exceeded the EPA no-contact threshold for MC in recreational waters (8 mu g/L), with a maximum concentration of 17 mu g/L occurring during a bloom event. Average MC concentrations in surface foreshore sands (4 mu g/L porewater) were significantly higher, on average, than in deeper sands (2 mu g/L porewater), while peak sand MC concentrations exceeded 29 mu g/L during two bloom events. Overall, MC concentrations in both shallow and deep sand exceeded water MC concentrations in 56 % of samples, indicating accumulation of MC in foreshore sands. MC persistence was determined in laboratory microcosms containing either autoclaved or non-autoclaved sands augmented with MC. ELISA analysis showed a 46 % reduction in MC concentration in autoclaved sands over 7 weeks. In non-autoclaved sands, the MC concentration decreased by 100 % during the study, with approximately 99 % of the added MC degrading during days 21-28, suggesting that a biological mechanism drove degradation. Our findings reveal that beach sands can act as MC reservoirs, accumulating and concentrating MC during and following bloom events.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102601	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102601		JUL 2025											WOS:001540922200028

Several changes were made to the lake model to fix its problems with showing how the temperature changes in UL. Because the salinity was abnormally high in this lake, changes had to be made to the formulas for water density, freezing point, and saturation vapor pressure. A dynamic data assimilation method was also used to use in-situ observations to keep the lake surface temperature up to date. For the cold season of 2016-2017, model simulations were run and the model's performance was assessed using field observations, reanalysis data, and satellite retrievals. The results indicated significant discrepancies between the results from model with default configuration and in-situ observations. The model underestimated LSWT and had cold biases, particularly during nighttime. After trying out different combinations, the SLake model, which included all of the changes, worked the best. It enhanced the accuracy of LSWT prediction and eliminated thermal stratification patterns. The model was still not able to reproduce the lake's complicated thermal behavior; hence, a dynamic LSWT assimilation method was employed that used in-situ data to keep the lake surface temperature up to date. This new method cut down the cold bias in LSWT by a large amount and improved the simulation of near-surface air temperatures significantly. The dynamic LSWT updates also improved simulations of lake evaporation, with the SLake_LSWT configuration outperformed other models and GLEAM predictions. The study shows importance of inclusion of physical properties of hypersaline lakes in to numerical models to have realistic results.

A significant portion of regional coastal erosion is influenced by coastal structures such as harbor jetties of varying sizes. To understand the effects of coastal structures on local sediment transport and budget, this study focuses on medium-sized harbor jetties at South Haven, MI, in southeastern Lake Michigan, representative of many recreational harbors and harbors of refuge along Great Lakes shorelines. The wave-current-sediment transport processes were simulated using a coupled model, which integrates Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN), FiniteVolume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM), and Community Sediment Transport Modeling System (CSTMS). Our results indicate that during storm events, the presence of a pair of jetties consistently leads to a substantial decrease in longshore sediment transport on the downdrift side within a 2 km region. For the entire navigation season from April to December, the storm-time averaged currents and longshore sediment transport are predominantly southward. The jetties increase net sediment transport updrift of the jetties and enhance offshore sediment transport. Simultaneously, they significantly reduce downdrift sediment transport, with persistent eddy structures near the jetty limiting the sediment transported out of the immediate region adjacent to the southern jetty. Consequently, sediment can accrete on both sides of the jetties, potentially widening the beaches. Meanwhile, the region further south of the jetties experiences severe erosion due to a reduced sediment supply from upstream. Understanding the dynamics of sediment transport and budget, particularly with the jetties' influences, is crucial for coastal management.

The objectives were to (1) investigate the impacts of climate change on hydrology and corn yield in southeast Michigan, United States, and (2) assess the climate change impact on the optimum drain spacings under two drain depths of 75 cm shallow and 125 cm deep. Using DRAINMOD and climate projections (2030-2059) from nine general circulation models under the SSP2-4.5 pathway, the study predicted hydrological responses and economic returns for various drain spacing designs. The optimum drain spacing was determined as the spacing that maximizes economic return using historical (1994-2023) and future scenarios. Future predictions showed an increased annual temperature (9.6 degrees C for historical vs 12.1 degrees C for future), relatively stable annual precipitation (933 mm for historical vs 928 mm for future), increased evapotranspiration (21%), reduced drainage discharge (21%), and deeper water table (7%) compared to the historical. Drought stress was the primary driver of future yield reductions, averaging 25% for both drain depths. The number of dry days during the growing season is expected to increase in the future due to higher evapotranspiration and a deeper water table. Optimum drain spacings were projected to widen from 7 m to 11 m for shallow drains and from 12 m to 19 m for deep drains to mitigate drought stress. In conclusion, future climate conditions showed a yield decline, suggesting a wider drain spacing may be needed to mitigate the drier growing season.

This study aimed to predict and map the spatio-temporal patterns of both optically and non-optically active water quality parameters within small inland water bodies located in the COHWHS.Methods High-resolution Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) satellite data and two random forest models (Model 1 [consisting of sensitive spectral bands] and Model 2 [consisting of spectral bands + indices]) were used alongside In-situ measurements of chlorophyll-a, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, Temperature, and electrical conductivity (EC) were integrated to establish empirical relationships and assess spatial variability across high-flow and low-flow conditions.Results The results indicated that DO could be predicted with the highest accuracy under low-flow conditions, followed by EC. Specifically, Model 2 achieved an R2 of 0.88 and an RMSE of 1.37 for DO, while Model 1 achieved an R2 of 0.63 and an RMSE of 291.48 for EC. For optically active parameters, suspended solids showed the highest prediction accuracy under high-flow conditions using Model 2 (R2p = 0.55; RMSE = 118.19). Due to the over-pixelation of other smaller water bodies within the COHWHS in Sentinel-2 imagery, Cradlemoon Lake was selected to show distinct seasonal (high- and low-flow) and spatial variations in optically and non-optically active water quality parameters.Discussion Variations in the results were influenced by runoff dynamics and upstream pollution: lower Temperatures and suspended solids under low-flow conditions increased DO concentrations, whereas higher suspended solid concentrations under high-flow conditions likely reduced light penetration, resulting in lower spectral reflectance and chlorophyll-a levels. These findings highlight the potential of Sentinel-2 MSI data and machine learning models for monitoring dynamic water quality variations in freshwater ecosystems.

However, the seasonal dynamics of AOA and AOB communities in floodplain lakes are unclear. Here, on the basis of the high-throughput sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene, we investigated the diversity, abundance, and community structure of sediment AOA and AOB in wet, mid-dry, and dry seasons in Poyang Lake, the largest floodplain lake in China. The results revealed that the AOA and AOB communities were subject to substantial seasonal variations. Specifically, the three seasons shared only 14.4-28.3% and 17.4-25.2% of the total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for each AOA and AOB community, respectively. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA) further indicated that the community structure of both AOA and AOB differed significantly among seasons. In addition, the season exerted a marked influence on the alpha diversity of AOA but not that of AOB. The season did not significantly impact the abundance of either AOA or AOB. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were significantly related to the AOA community structure in the lake sediments, while organic matter (OM) was significantly associated with the AOB community composition. Our research demonstrates that there are seasonal variations in AOA and AOB communities in floodplain lake sediments, highlighting the impact of seasonal water level fluctuations on the nitrification process within such habitats.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL 17	2025	87	4							84	10.1007/s00027-025-01212-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-025-01212-z													WOS:001530760900001

Based on multiple machine learning methods, we investigated seasonal and annual CO2 fluxes, and the discrepancy in contributions and threshold behaviors of key variables to CO2 flux variations, in two river-connected lakes (Hongze and Poyang) and two non-river-connected lakes (Chaohu and Taihu). Random Forest performed well in CO2 flux simulations, with R2 values ranging from 0.91 to 0.95. Our results indicated that all four lakes acted as CO2 sources. Hongze Lake had higher CO2 fluxes in the wet season than in the dry season, while the other three lakes showed the opposite pattern. Solar radiation and pH were the dominant factors influencing CO2 flux variations in Hongze Lake and Taihu Lake, respectively. CO2 flux variations in river-connected lakes were more sensitive to total phosphorus (TP) concentration than in non-river-connected lakes, due to shorter hydrologic residence time, causing a faster response of chlorophyll-a to TP, with the lag times of chlorophyll-a responses to TP being 0-1 months for river-connected lakes and 1-4 months for non-river-connected lakes. Conversely, CO2 emissions in non-river-connected lakes were strongly influenced by pH, with the pH peak occurring 1 month earlier than the peak of CO2 fluxes during the wet season. Threshold behaviors were revealed for pH, solar radiation, wind speed, TP and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations, and lake level/volume, with non-linear responses affecting CO2 flux dynamics in each lake. These mechanistic findings enhance the scientific understanding on lake carbon emissions.					wu, haohao/HGC-4633-2022														0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP	2025	391								126603	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.126603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.126603		JUL 2025						40669184					WOS:001534308200002

As a result, these studies only investigate the behavior of naive hatchery fish, leaving a knowledge gap regarding long-term survivors. We compared the movement, space use, and survival of wild and hatchery-reared brown trout (Salmo trutta) that had survived for multiple years in a large Swedish lake (345 km2). Acoustic tracking of 38 wild and 56 naturalized, hatchery-origin trout over 4 years revealed similar weekly travel distances, sub-basin transitions, and survival rates between the groups. However, wild trout exhibited greater seasonal variability in their movement and sub-basin usage than their hatchery-reared conspecifics. These differences may reflect a reduced ability of hatchery trout to respond to environmental cues (e.g., prey availability). Our findings highlight that while hatchery-reared trout can persist in the wild, behavioral differences may influence their local ecological interactions and long-term fitness.

The problem is especially severe in areas with intensive mineral resource development and hardware manufacturing. Moreover, frequent heavy rainfall and flooding during the flood season significantly increase surface runoff and sediments resuspension, promoting the mobilization and redistribution of heavy metals (HMs) in river systems. Therefore, it is of great practical importance to systematically identify the distribution characteristics and ecological risks of HMs pollution in such regions under changing climatic conditions. Eighty-five surface sediment samples were collected in Southwest China, and the concentrations of As, Hg, Cd, and Pb were determined. The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and the potential ecological risk index (RI) were used to assess contamination levels and ecological risks, and principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) were applied to trace pollution sources. The results show that Cd and Hg have similar spatial patterns, with high concentrations mainly downstream of mining areas and industrial parks. Igeo and RI assessments indicate that Hg pollution in sediments is severe in four major rivers of Dazu District, followed by Cd, while As and Pb show relatively low pollution levels. Source apportionment revealed that industrial and traffic-related activities contribute 55.05% of HMs inputs, mining activities account for 41.28%, and natural sources contribute 3.67%. Cd and Pb mainly originate from industrial emissions and traffic, Hg is primarily associated with mining, and As is derived from natural sources.																				2296-665X				JUL 14	2025	13								1646212	10.3389/fenvs.2025.1646212	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2025.1646212													WOS:001537040000001

Based on Landsat 8/9 satellite data from dry (January) and wet (May) seasons in 2020 and 2023 used for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval combined with land use data, buffer zone gradient analysis was adopted to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of key cooling indicators within 0-1500 m lakeshore buffers. The results demonstrated significant seasonal differences. The wet season showed a greater cooling extent (600 m) and higher intensity (6.0-6.6 degrees C) compared with the dry season (400 m; 2.4-3.9 degrees C). The land cover responses varied substantially, with cropland having the largest influence (600 m), followed by impervious surfaces (400 m), while forest exhibited a minimal effective cooling range (100 m) but localized warming anomalies at 200-400 m. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that impervious surfaces were the most sensitive to water-cooling, followed by cropland, whereas forest showed the lowest sensitivity.					ma, ziyang/MFI-5188-2025; Wang, Zhihao/OIS-7080-2025															2073-4433				JUL 14	2025	16	7							856	10.3390/atmos16070856	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16070856													WOS:001539639100001

We analyzed a 404 cm sediment core from a floodplain lake to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes and carbon storage dynamics over the last 4550 cal yr BP. The Middle to Late-Holocene transition (4550-4270 cal yr BP) was characterized by significant hydrological changes. Low chlorophyll derivative values during this period reflect elevated water levels and variable discharge regimes, consistent with a braided channel system exhibiting high hydrodynamic energy and unstable fluvial architecture. These conditions prevented the establishment of stable lentic environments, resulting in highly variable deposition of organic compounds. Between 4270 and 3865 cal yr BP, sedimentary and organic proxies showed pronounced variability, indicating shifts in precipitation patterns and fluvial geomorphology. Organic matter exhibited high C/N ratios and delta C-13 values, indicating a predominantly allochthonous origin, likely from vascular plant material with C4 signatures. Carbon accumulation rates peaked at 196 g m(-2) yr(-1) around 4050 cal yr BP. The period 3865-3200 cal yr BP marked the establishment of arboreal vegetation alongside increased lacustrine productivity with enhanced algal contributions, signaling a transition to more humid conditions. Maximum primary productivity occurred between 3200 and 2100 cal yr BP, coinciding with the development of the current levee-lake morphology, with carbon accumulation averaging 18 g m(-2) yr(-1). From 2100 to 760 cal yr BP, sediment records indicate an intensified dryness compared to preceding and subsequent periods, with reduced carbon accumulation rate of only similar to 15 g m(-2) yr(-1). The most recent 760 years, particularly the last two centuries, show significantly increased carbon fluxes (38.1 g m(-2) yr(-1)) associated with wetter conditions. Our results demonstrate that Late-Holocene hydroclimatic variations, including increased humidity and seasonal variability, exerted fundamental control on sedimentary dynamics, lacustrine productivity, and carbon storage in the Rio Negro floodplain system.

In this context, this study aims to assess the occurrence of six BTRs and ten BPs across two sampling campaigns (SCs) in the lakes and streams of Killarney National Park (KNP), Ireland, revealing spatial variation across six sampling points (SPs). A Wilcoxon test revealed no statistically significant differences between individual concentrations in the two SCs. This research utilized ultrasound-assisted emulsification-microextraction for analytes isolation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for detection (USAEME-GC/MS) to determine BTRs and BPs concentrations in KNP's water bodies. Among the 34.4 % of occurrences above the limit of detection, BPA, 5Cl-BTR, and UV-P were consistently found across all sampling points and campaigns. Two BTRs (1H-BTR, 4Me-BTR) and five BPs (BPC, BPCl2, BPE, BPG, BPM) were below detection levels in both SCs. The maximum concentrations for BTRs reached 1.537 mu g/L (5Cl-BTR, SP2, SC2). BPA concentrations peaked at 7.753 mu g/L (SP6, SC2), exceeding the EU's predicted noeffect concentration for freshwater (1.5 mu g/L) in six instances across the KNP samples.

Microorganisms within these ecosystems mediate key processes that regulate these cycles. Metagenomic analyses provide valuable insights into the taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial communities in various environments, including freshwater habitats. Here, we present a comprehensive metagenomic dataset derived from Lake Soyang, the largest freshwater reservoir in South Korea. A total of 28 metagenomes were generated from water samples collected across two distinct sampling periods: the first set (n = 8) was obtained between April 2014 and January 2015 from two depths (1 m and 50 m) in four different seasons, while the second set (n = 20) was collected between January 2019 and November 2019 from five depths (1, 10, 20, 40, and 90 m) over four seasons. Metagenomic sequencing yielded 9.3-21.8 Gbp per sample. This dataset provides a valuable resource for future studies exploring the ecophysiological characteristics of microbial communities in pelagic freshwater environments.																				2052-4463				JUL 11	2025	12	1							1201	10.1038/s41597-025-05569-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-05569-6								40645966					WOS:001526659700005

Nevertheless, the spatial and seasonal variations in the plankton community structure, as well as their interactions with environmental factors, remain inadequately understood. This study investigated the alterations in the phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure across different geographical regions (southern, central, and northern) and seasonal periods (rainy and dry) in Erhai lake, located in a subtropical plateau in China. The results indicated that the average values of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chla), pH, and conductivity are significantly higher during the rainy season in comparison to the dry season. Furthermore, during the rainy season, there were significant differences in the concentrations of TN, TP, and Chla among the three designated water areas. Notable differences were also observed in the distribution of Microcystis, the density of Cladocera and copepods, and the biomass of copepods across the three regions during this season. Conversely, in the dry season, only the biomass of Cladocera exhibited significant variation among the three water areas. The redundancy analysis (RDA) and variance partitioning analysis demonstrated that the distribution of plankton groups (Cyanophyta, Cryptophyta, and Cladocera) is significantly associated with TN, Secchi depth (SD), and Chla during the rainy season, whereas it is significantly correlated with TP and SD during the dry season. These findings underscore the critical influence of environmental factors, shaped by rainfall patterns, in driving these ecological changes. In the context of the early stages of eutrophication in Lake Erhai, it is essential to ascertain the spatial distribution of water quality parameters, as well as phytoplankton and zooplankton density and biomass, during both the rainy and dry seasons.					yin, chengjie/C-4162-2018															2410-3888				JUL 11	2025	10	7							343	10.3390/fishes10070343	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes10070343													WOS:001535538300001

However, limited research has systematically assessed the three primary emission pathways, diffusion, ebullition, and plant-mediated transport, across heterogeneous lacustrine habitats within these ecosystems. This study combined field surveys and gas stable carbon isotopic analyses to quantify CH4 and CO2 emissions through multiple pathways (diffusion, ebullition, and plant-mediated) in different habitats, including open water (OW), emergent vegetation (E), submerged vegetation (S), and submerged and macrofilamentous algal symbiosis (SA), in Lake Ulansuhai during the growing season. Compared with the remaining three habitats, habitat SA had the highest CH4 emission (17.41 f 20.65mmol m-2 d-1) and the lowest CO2 emission (50.27 f 40.03mmol m-2 d-1). CH4 emissions peaked during the peak growth season in July, whereas CO2 emissions peaked at the end of the growing season in October. The vegetated habitats had nine times more CH4 than the non-vegetated habitats. The CH4 flux from the vegetated habitats was primarily plant-mediated (mean 74 %), followed by ebullition (17 %). The fractionation factor (alpha C) values of delta 13C-CH4 and delta 13C-CO2 in the dissolved gas and bubbles indicated more acetoclastic methanogenesis, with CO2 likely derived from organic matter remineralization and biometabolism. This indicates that the plants promoted methanogenesis by providing substrates, contributing to the high CH4 emissions from Lake Ulansuhai. This study improves the accuracy of regional carbon emission estimates in multi-habitat aquatic systems and further elucidates how aquatic plants influence carbon emissions.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2025	178								113864	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113864		JUL 2025											WOS:001534540700001

Soil consolidation accelerated by drought is assumed to be an important factor affecting CO2 emissions from wetland soils. However, very few studies have proved this. Methods Here, we employed a mesocosm experiment to simulate sedge colonization under warming scenarios over an entire growing season. This experiment continuously monitored CO2 fluxes, along with water vapor (H2O) fluxes, changes in sediment surface elevation, soil chemical properties, plant growth characteristics, and the diversity of bacterial and fungal communities. Results Warming significantly impacts soil CO2 emissions in mudflats, causing increases of up to 75%. However, in sedge colonized treatments, an increase of only 8% for soil CO2 flux was found. In addition to H2O fluxes in the mudflat, significant differences were only found in sediment surface elevation change between warming and control treatments among all the other factors. A significant positive correlation between CO2 flux and H2O flux with sediment surface elevation change was revealed in the mudflat, as opposed to the sedge colonized treatment. Conclusions Our results indicate that soil consolidation caused by drought was the primary driver leading to the higher CO2 emissions in mudflat under warming conditions, while sedge colonization can offset this effect. This study first provides evidence for the effect of soil consolidation on wetland CO2 emissions, providing new insights into evaluating CO2 budgets under global climate change.

J	Kubilay, S; Estévez, E; Ortiz, JB; Singer, G				Kubilay, Selin; Estevez, Edurne; Barquin Ortiz, Jose; Singer, Gabriel			Responses of riverine dissolved organic matter to damming in two distinct hydrological regimes in northern Spain	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Iberian rivers are characterized by flow regimes with high seasonal flow variation. They also host one-fifth of Europe's reservoirs for hydropower generation, irrigation, or water supply needs, and thus many rivers in this region have heavily altered flow regimes. Such flow conditions also alter the natural dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which likely has implications for carbon cycling due to changed conditions for the transformation, transportation, production, and storage of carbon. Here we looked into the effects of flow alteration on the DOM regime, i.e. the seasonal variation in DOM concentration and composition, in 20 rivers belonging to two different natural (reference) flow regimes (i.e. Mediterranean and Atlantic) in northern Spain. To further investigate which flow regime components influence DOM properties, we linked the observed seasonal shifts in DOM composition to a range of hydrological indices. We found that Atlantic rivers with a natural flow regime tended to have lower annual mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations than their altered equivalents; this flow alteration trend is weakly mirrored in Mediterranean rivers. We did not observe much difference in annual average DOM composition due to flow alteration in either Atlantic or Mediterranean rivers. However, the seasonal variation in DOM composition was lower in altered Atlantic rivers compared to natural ones. This flow alteration effect on the DOM regime was not as distinctive in Mediterranean rivers, which showed a higher diversity of DOM regimes across rivers. We linked the lack of seasonal variation in DOM composition in flow-altered rivers mainly to the prevention of transmission of upstream-sourced DOM from the reservoirs. It appears that in our study area, reservoirs mostly act as a temporally homogenizing buffer, averaging out naturally occurring shifts in DOM composition by transiently storing upstream-sourced carbon inputs and subjecting them to bio- and photo-degradation, thus sending relatively invariable amounts of DOM further downstream. This effect of dams on DOM regimes appears robust across both Atlantic and Mediterranean regimes despite some heterogeneity of dam types and purposes, with potentially important consequences for riverine carbon cycling.

J	Kuo, YM; Chen, YH; Chiu, YT; Lin, TF				Kuo, Yi-Ming; Chen, Yi-Hsuan; Chiu, Yi-Ting; Lin, Tsair-Fuh			Water quality and physicochemical conditions drive chlorophyll-a concentrations in two connected subtropical off-stream reservoirs	SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The assessment of reservoir water quality is essential for ecosystem preservation and sustainable water resource management. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) serves as a key bioindicator of phytoplankton dynamics and trophic status in aquatic ecosystems. This study applied Generalized Additive Mixed Models to investigate the environmental drivers of Chl-a variations in two interconnected subtropical off-stream reservoirs, Ren-Yi and Lan-Tan, in Taiwan. Water temperature and rainfall were identified as primary determinants of Chl-a fluctuations in both reservoirs. However, Ren-Yi Reservoir exhibited stronger external nutrient loading effects, with ammonia and total phosphorus significantly influencing Chl-a levels. These findings coincide with elevated chemical oxygen demand, total phosphate, and total nitrogen concentrations in the Ba-Zhang River, the main inflow source. In contrast, Lan-Tan Reservoir was more influenced by depth-driven variations, reflecting thermal stratification and internal nutrient cycling. Seasonal variations in Chl-a were more pronounced in Ren-Yi Reservoir due to direct riverine inputs, while Lan-Tan exhibited attenuated but noticeable seasonal fluctuations, highlighting the importance of regulatory effect of inflow connectivity. A key finding was that dataset size influenced model performance, with seasonality emerging as a crucial factor in the larger dataset (300 data points), revealing intensified seasonal variations. This underscores the need to incorporate seasonality in predictive models. The study demonstrates that external and internal factors regulate Chl-a concentrations, emphasizing targeted reservoir management strategies. Proactive measures, such as reducing Ba-Zhang River nutrient inflows, optimizing hydrological regulation, and real-time monitoring, are recommended to mitigate phytoplankton blooms and enhance water quality. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of Chl-a dynamics in interconnected reservoirs, informing sustainable water management strategies.

J	Alegria, FS; Gosselin, PL; Coelho, LC; Renaud, J				Alegria, Francisco Stevens; Gosselin, Pierre-Luc; Coelho, Leandro C.; Renaud, Jacques			Simulation and optimization of river navigation: the case of the St. Lawrence River and the Port of Quebec	MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS												Ports are major infrastructures subject to multiple constraints, such as seasonal variability of ship arrivals, tides, availability of docks and tugs, and sometimes even waterways with restricted access. All these characteristics are combined at the Port of Quebec, which is close to the Traverse Nord, a narrow strip of seaway highly affected by tides, acting as a variable-depth canal. While many of these characteristics are directly related to the St. Lawrence River, such as the tides or types of ships that pass through the seaway (often towards other ports), some others are under the control of the port authority, such as dock and berth allocation, tug usage, and the management of the Traverse Nord, which is also the major gateway for inland ports in Canada and the United States, all the way to the Great Lakes. To enable port authorities to evaluate different operational alternatives and perspectives, we have developed a simulation and optimization system based on data from the Port of Quebec, which allows us to quantify the impact of managerial decisions on the waiting time to access a tug. The developed simulation includes queueing systems, speed optimization, passage priorities, and berth and tug allocation. The impact of dock and tug management is clearly demonstrated, as well as the importance of adequate traffic planning that must pass through the Traverse Nord seaway. Our simulation can be used as a decision-making tool by port authorities, giving visibility to short-term operational decisions and long-term planning strategies.

These challenges include the limitation of resources for continuous field-based data collection for the assessment of both the ecological status and the implementation of regulations measures on these water bodies. In such a context, remote sensing-based monitoring could provide a sustainable solution. The current study used EO data Sentinel-1 SAR to develop a classification approach for detection a traditional fish method using dry branches (called acadja), and water hyacinth (which mainly occurs in acadja) in Lake Nokoue<acute accent> (Benin). The employed method analyses the distribution of VV and VH polarisation values to determine the boundary (threshold interval) between acadjas and water hyacinth objects on one hand, and open water on the other. This analysis, referred to as a 'quartile-based threshold analysis', was conducted from 2019 to 2023, taking seasonal variations into account. The study results show that VH polarisation is a more stable method for detecting acadjas and water hyacinths. The overall accuracy of object detection is 87%, with a confusion rate of less than 5% throughout the study period. A comparison of these results with those produced by the Otsu algorithm and the use of NDVI indicates that the latter underestimates the areas covered by acadjas and water hyacinths.

This study assessed the malaria vector diversity, seasonal abundance, transmission and insecticide resistance status of malaria vectors in these communities to inform effective control strategies.MethodsMosquitoes were collected from three Island communities (Tuanikope, Allorkpem and Pediatorkope) using human landing catches, light traps and prokopack aspirators during the dry and rainy seasons. Morphological and molecular techniques were used to identify mosquito species, determine blood meal sources and detect insecticide resistance mutations. Sporozoite infections and entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) were also quantified.ResultsA total of 25,092 mosquitoes from four genera were collected (Culicine = 88.14%, Anopheline = 8.94% and Mansonia = 2.92%). The Anophelines predominantly comprised Anopheles gambiae s.l. (1,911/2,243, 85.20%) followed by An. rufipes (249/2,243, 11.10%) and An. pharoensis (83/2,243, 3.70%). Indoor biting and resting densities were high across sites and seasons, with sporozoite-positive mosquitoes more frequently found indoors. Blood meal analysis revealed a strong anthropophilic feeding pattern (HBI = 80%). Annual EIRs ranged from 37.40 (ib/m/y) to 100.08 (ib/m/y). Low frequencies of insecticide resistance mutations (Vgsc-1014 F, Vgsc-1014 S, Ace-1 and Vgsc-1575Y) were observed.ConclusionThe study findings indicate high indoor biting and resting densities of Anopheles mosquitoes. High sporozoite rate along with low resistance mutation frequencies observed, emphasize the urgent need for continuous resistance monitoring and the implementation of targeted vector control strategies in these hard-to-reach Island communities.

While zooplankton grazers such as Daphnia can have an important role in suppressing cyanobacteria blooms, cyanobacteria can adversely impact Daphnia fitness and even kill them. Earlier work has shown an evolutionary increase in tolerance to cyanobacteria across years and strong genotype x genotype interactions determining the interaction between Daphnia and the cyanobacterium Microcystis. Here, we test the hypothesis that Daphnia magna can adapt during 1 growing season to changes in dominant strains of Microcystis. Over 2 consecutive years, we collected D. magna clonal lineages and Microcystis strains from a single pond early and late in the growing season and we assessed whether Daphnia survival differed when exposed to Microcystis strains from either the same or a different time point within the growth season. Our findings reveal important Daphnia genotype x Microcystis genotype interactions, with Daphnia survival being higher when exposed to Microcystis from the same time point than when exposed to Microcystis of a different time point. Our results extend earlier findings to variation within 1 single natural system and growth season, and suggest an important impact of rapid (co)evolutionary dynamics shaping the tolerance of zooplankton grazers to cyanobacteria.

J	Liu, C				Liu, Chen			Spatially-informed interpolation for reconstructing lake area time series using semantic neighborhood correlation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Long-term, high-resolution records of lake surface area are essential for characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of inland water bodies. Although Synthetic Aperture Radar has substantially improved water extent detection under adverse conditions, optical remote sensing imagery remains the dominant data source owing to its higher spatial resolution. Nevertheless, optical data are frequently compromised by persistent cloud cover and sensor limitations, leading to substantial observational gaps. To effectively address this challenge, this study introduces a novel spatially-informed interpolation method termed Semantic Neighborhood Correlation-based Interpolation (SNCI), which leverages spatial correlations among hydrologically interconnected lakes to reconstruct missing lake area observations. By explicitly modeling the inherent hydrological and climatic coherence among neighboring lakes, SNCI provides robust, accurate, and scalable interpolations even in the presence of extensive temporal data losses. The method was evaluated on monthly lake area data from 54 lakes in the Wuhan region between 2000 and 2020, using the Global Surface Water dataset, and validated against high-resolution Dynamic World observations. Several representative lakes were analyzed in detail to assess SNCI's robustness across diverse seasonal and interannual conditions. Compared with polynomial fitting, Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory, SNCI consistently achieves lower interpolation errors. In the case of East Lake, SNCI reduces mean absolute error by 50.1% and root mean square error by 28.3% relative to the best-performing baseline. Across all lakes, SNCI demonstrates superior accuracy and correlation, particularly under data-sparse conditions. These results underscore SNCI's potential to enhance lake area reconstruction accuracy and support broader applications in hydrological modeling, environmental monitoring, and climate impact assessment.																			2045-2322					JUL 9	2025	15	1							24787	10.1038/s41598-025-09410-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-09410-3								40634586					WOS:001526469000024

Freshwater ecosystems are the ultimate destination for many pollutants, including plastic particles with diameter < 5 mm, commonly referred to as microplastics. When present in the aquatic environment, fishes actively or passively consume these microplastic particles. Studies on the natural diet of fishes can highlight and elucidate the impacts of this pollutant on aquatic ecosystems. In the study reported here, the stomachs, intestines and gills from 122 fishes (14 species) collected from the Curia & uacute; River Resort during the dry and rainy seasons were analyzed by chemical digestion with KOH to verify the presence of microplastics. The fishes were categorized by trophic guild (herbivore, carnivore, piscivore, omnivore) and collection period (dry vs. rainy). We found a total of 732 microplastics, all classified as fibers, in 96% of the fishes examined. The predominant colors of the fibers were blue (59%) and black (33%). The highest consumption of microplastics occurred during the rainy season. Among the six most abundant fish species sampled, microplastics were most common in the cichlid Geophagus (eartheaters). We also found differences between trophic guilds, with carnivores scoring highest in terms of the consumption of microplastics. We found no association between fish size and weight and the quantity of microplastic particles consumed. This study provides valuable baseline data on the ingestion of microplastics by fishes in the Curia & uacute; Resort, as well as new insights into the consumption of microplastic particles by freshwater fishes. We also compared our results to those from similar studies of fishes in aquatic environments around the world.

Many of these products are released into the environment via municipal wastewater treatment plants and onsite wastewater treatment systems (septic tanks). Consequently, it is essential to ascertain whether these contaminants pose any risk to aquatic organisms who live in the water bodies receiving this waste. Risk quotients (RQ) are a commonly used method to do so. For our pilot study, we undertook such analysis for three trophic levels: algae, crustaceans, and fish from two small lakes, one fed by septic tanks and the other not. This research was conducted in 2021 from the end of the dry season and through most of the wet season in west central Florida, USA. Of the 14 PPCPs measured, six had RQs that posed a risk to all three trophic levels. This risk increased during the wet season. Both lakes, regardless of whether they directly received PPCPs from septic tanks or not, had some level of risk.

J	Jerand, P; Buckland, PI; Linderholm, J				Jerand, Philip; Buckland, Philip I.; Linderholm, Johan			Human traces in Arctic soils: Geoarchaeological evidence from 19th-century herders and farmers	POLAR RECORD												This study examines how human activities influenced soil development at two contrasting Arctic sites: Maiva, a 19th-century farmstead, and Snuvrejohka, a seasonal S & aacute;mi reindeer herding settlement in the Lake Tornetr & auml;sk region, northern Sweden. Using geochemical and geophysical soil analyses, we explore the spatial distribution and vertical development of anthropogenic signals in the soil. At Maiva, prolonged agricultural use and earthworm bioturbation have led to extensive soil mixing and altered soil horizons, resulting in elevated phosphate, lead, and organic matter concentrations in Ap and Ah horizons. In contrast, Snuvrejohka displays more stratified profiles with localized chemical enrichment around hearths, primarily within E horizons. These results highlight how different land-use practices leave distinct geochemical fingerprints in Arctic soils and emphasize the need for sampling strategies adapted to site-specific soil formation processes. Our findings demonstrate that even short-term or seasonal human activities can leave distinct and detectable signatures in Arctic soils. Through an integrated approach combining soil science, geoarchaeological methods, and historical data, this study provides new insights into the reconstruction of past land-use practices and highlights the vulnerability of archaeological soil records in Arctic environments facing rapid climate-driven change.

Friedel; Islebe, Gerald A.; Aragon-Moreno, Alejandro A.			4700 Years of Paleoecological History from Lake Chichancanab, Quintana Roo, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												This study highlights the paleoecological history of Quintana Roo, Mexico using palynological and elemental signatures from Lake Chichancanab sediments. Pollen Zone I, 4700-3200 cal yr BP, is dominated by tropical forest taxa, indicating wetter climate. However, a prolonged drought occurs between 4300 and 4000 BP. Pollen Zones IIa and IIb, 3200-1700 BP, exhibit a decline in seasonal dry tropical forest and rise in disturbance species, aligning with the regional drying trend and expansion of Maya settlements during the Late Preclassic. Pollen Zones IIIa and IIIb (1700 BP-present) are dominated by disturbance pollen, reflecting late Holocene drying and sociopolitical dynamics that altered ecosystem processes. Elemental analysis of the lake core suggests a transition from a stable environment in Zone I to higher detrital input in Zone IIa, supporting drier conditions indicated by the pollen data. Between 2500 and 1700 BP, the Ca/S ratio suggests enhanced detrital input under dry and open conditions. Between 1700 and 1000 BP the Ca/Fe ratio reflects low detrital input and carbonate deposition. From 1000 BP until present a decreased Ca/Fe ratio suggests increased detrital input. These novel data further our understanding of the relationships between humans, vegetation, and climate of the Maya region.

Studies on its sexual cycle and fecundity were conducted on a population from an oxbow lake of the central Vistula River in Poland. The fish ranged in age from 1 + to 9+. The average body length (SL) was 14.4 +/- 3.4 cm. Individuals as young as 1 + were already mature. Females lay eggs multiple times from mid-April to mid-June, with absolute fecundity averaging 3227 oocytes and relative fecundity at 46 oocytes g-1. The highest mean GSI of 1.9 during spawning was recorded in June. The reproductive tract of males takes the shape of lobes and consists of a paired cranial region formed by testes and a caudal region of undefined function. In males, semi-cystic spermatogenesis occurs, with secondary spermatocytes leaving cysts. Males overwinter with tubules filled with spermatids and initiate spermatozoa formation. The highest average GSI of 0.49 was recorded in early April. The brown bullhead observed in the new habitat was characterized by multiple egg laying, earlier maturation of individuals, and spawning in the earlier part of the calendar year, i.e. mid-April to mid-June, compared to its native habitat.

This study estimated the RUE of plankton communities and quantified the relative effects of nutrient levels and physical and chemical factors on RUE in the Fu River to Poyang Lake continuum, revealing significant spatiotemporal differences. Phytoplankton RUE was significantly higher in rivers than that in lakes, while zooplankton RUE was higher in lakes than in rivers. Additionally, RUE was higher during normal and wet seasons compared to dry season. Linear mixed-effects models revealed that eutrophication are the key drivers of phytoplankton RUE in both rivers and lakes, showing negative correlations with Trophic Level Index (TLI) in the river, and with phosphate and nitrate-nitrogen in the lake. Zooplankton RUE is mainly driven by discharge and nitrite-nitrogen in river and lake systems, respectively. These insights underscore the remarkable ecological flexibility of plankton and further offer in-depth valuable perspectives to enhance river and lake water quality, controlling nutrient pollution and enhancing ecological functions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				2025 JUL 8	2025										10.1007/s10750-025-05943-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-025-05943-w		JUL 2025											WOS:001524997300001

Based on historical data (1947-2021) and a water balance model, the contribution of surface runoff, precipitation and evaporation to the formation of the lake's hydrological regime was assessed. It was established that the main source of water resources for the lake is the flow of the Ile River, which feeds the western part of the reservoir. The eastern part is characterized by extremely limited water inflow, while evaporation remains the main element of water consumption, having increased significantly in recent decades due to rising air temperatures. Increasing intra-seasonal and interannual fluctuations in water levels have been recorded: The amplitude of short-term fluctuations reached 0.7-0.8 m, which exceeds previously characteristic values. The results of water balance modeling up to 2050 show a trend towards a 30% reduction in surface inflow and an increase in evaporation by 25% compared to the 1981-2010 climate norm, which highlights the high sensitivity of the lake's hydrological regime to climatic and anthropogenic influences. The results obtained justify the need for the comprehensive and adaptive management of water resources in the Balkhash Lake basin, taking into account the transboundary nature of water use and changing climatic conditions.

However, despite these significant economic and ecological implications, the spatiotemporal patterns of beaver feeding strategies remain understudied. This study aimed to evaluate how forest stand type, lake size, and diet influence beaver territorial occupation in eastern Canada. We used a dendroecological approach to measure beaver occupation time and maximum browsing distance around 61 lakes. Around each beaver lodge, we established 1 m2 plots along three transects in which we measured distance of browsing from shore and counted annual rings on coppices resulting from beaver presence. PERMANOVA revealed that both maximum browsing distance ( p = 0.003) and temporal occupation ( p = 0.006) differed significantly across lake size categories. The type of forest stand had no impact on beaver dynamics. Stable isotope analysis (delta 13C and delta 15N) of beaver carcasses collected from local trappers showed that the beavers' diet included the consumption of conifer trees and a seasonal shift in food consumption. We found that lakes ranging from 4 to 20 ha were optimal for beavers, as this lake size mattered more than the availability of specific food sources. Beavers exhibited high adaptation skills by using different plant species depending on the season to maximize resource availability and energy cost trade-off. Understanding the factors involved in beaver territorial occupation dynamics is crucial for land managers and conservationists to effectively incorporate this species into forest management plans and mitigate beaver-human conflicts.					; Girona, Miguel/AAH-1642-2020; Grosbois, Guillaume/M-8097-2019	Grosbois, Guillaume/0000-0002-1306-8528; 														2351-9894				OCT	2025	62								e03723	10.1016/j.gecco.2025.e03723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2025.e03723		JUL 2025											WOS:001555658000002

In this study, water samples were collected from February to May 2024 from 11 sampling sites in a Cylindrospermopsis-bloom reservoir in western Guangdong province, China. At each sampling point, a water sample was collected every month. High-throughput sequencing was applied to analyze the interaction between Cylindrospermopsis and other bacteria. As shown in our results, the phyla Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Verrucomicrobiota, and Cyanobacteria were revealed as dominant phyla. Bacterial communities exhibited significant seasonal differences between flood and non-flood periods (ANOSIM: R = 0.472, p = 0.001). Cylindrospermopsis (dominance index Y = 0.53) acted as the keystone in the co-occurrence network (Z(i) < 2.5, P-i > 0.62) and closely interacted with other bacteria. For better management of the blue-green algae bloom reservoir, the phyla of Actinobacteriota, Dependentiae, Acidobacteriota, Armatimonadota, Gemmatimonadota, and Desulfobacterota were proposed as microbial indicators for the eutrophic process. This study provides a new insight into the interactions of Cyanobacteria with other bacteria and the management of blue-green algae outbreaks in reservoirs.																				2227-9717				JUL 4	2025	13	7							2129	10.3390/pr13072129	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr13072129													WOS:001536721400001

The combination of electrical resistivity tomography, sedimentary facies mapping, infiltration tests, and geotechnical sampling revealed blocks of preserved stratigraphy embedded in a relatively impermeable sedimentary matrix containing sands and clayey-silt components. Although the eroded dam face shows a heterogenous distribution of sedimentary facies, the hydraulic properties are dominated by a mixture of sand, silt, and clay resulting in a uniformly saturated phreatic zone with permeability values between 1 x 10-7 ms\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\frac{m}{s}$$\end{document}. and 1 x 10-8 ms\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\frac{m}{s}$$\end{document}. Analyses of a LiDAR survey clarify that the previously described single landslide is a pair of two landslides from which the northern Slide A dammed the Cuejdel Lake. An abandoned spillway path responding to the lowest point of the dam crest indicates erosion due to overtopping shortly after the dam formation. The low permeability resulting from the sedimentary matrix prevented a destruction of the dam by internal erosion during the early formation stages. Although overtopping occurred after the dam initiation, the failure progression towards a dam breach was guided by the seasonal variations of lake water levels. The seasonal decrease of the water level prohibited the advancement of the overtopping related erosion, while the increase of the lake water level in the consecutive wet season led to a stabilization through a spillway along the landslide toe. While valuable for rapid first order hazard assessment, current stability indices are not capable of reproducing the complex stabilization process of the Cuejdel Lake landslide dam, emphasizing the need for integrating facies-based geotechnical parameters and hydraulic variabilities in hazard assessments of individual cases.

This study investigated the Taipu River and five interconnected lakes to analyze the forms, spatial distribution, and ecological impact of nitrogen in both water and surface sediments. Sediment total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) were measured, with aquaculture-dominated lakes such as Xueluoyang Lake and Caodang Marsh exhibiting significantly higher sedimentary TN concentrations than the Taipu River. In Xueluoyang Lake, the average TN content reached 1037.3 mg/kg-1.87 times higher than in the river-highlighting the legacy effect of historical intensive aquaculture. Correlation analyses showed strong associations between sediment NH4+-N and NO3--N and nitrogen levels in overlying water, confirming sediments as a major endogenous nitrogen source. Multivariate statistical methods, including Pearson's correlation, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis, were applied to elucidate spatial patterns and key influencing factors. Water quality evaluation indices and sediment organic pollution assessments revealed widespread TN exceedance, particularly in dry seasons, with water quality deteriorating to Class V or worse. These results underscore the need for strengthened control of sedimentary nitrogen release and effective management of agricultural non-point source pollution to restore and protect water quality in river-lake systems.					; Li, Feipeng/F-4130-2019	Li, Feipeng/0000-0002-7114-9617; 														2073-4441				JUL 3	2025	17	13							2000	10.3390/w17132000	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17132000													WOS:001526084800001

This study aims to evaluate the multi-depth water quality dynamics of the Ribnica Reservoir in western Serbia, combining two standardized assessment tools: the Serbian Water Quality Index (SWQI) and the Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI). Data collected at various depths during 2021 and 2022 were analyzed to assess physico-chemical parameters and their impact on water quality, while the absence of microbiological data was noted as a limitation affecting the comprehensiveness of the assessment. The SWQI results indicated a general improvement in water quality over time, with values ranging from medium (82) to excellent (95) in 2021 and increasing from good (89) to excellent (98) in 2022. In contrast, the CWQI revealed specific risks, notably elevated concentrations of aluminum, mercury, and chromium, and reduced dissolved oxygen levels, with overall CWQI values ranging from poor (40) to good (88) depending on depth and parameter variability. The study highlights the necessity for continuous, comprehensive monitoring, including microbiological analyses and seasonal assessments, both within the reservoir and in the Crni Rzav River and its tributaries, to better understand pollutant sources and catchment influences. Strengthening microbiological and heavy metal monitoring, along with implementing proactive management strategies, is essential for preserving the Ribnica Reservoir's ecological integrity and securing its long-term role in drinking water provision.

While the ecological implications of browning have received considerable attention, its impacts on the photochemical production of reactive intermediates from DOM remain understudied despite their importance for biogeochemical processes and contaminant fate in sunlit surface waters. To address this gap, we investigated singlet oxygen (1O2) production in 37 lakes within the Adirondack Long-Term Monitoring (ALTM) program. Wavelet coherence tests confirmed the synchrony between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and color as well as the time-scale-dependent influence of regional atmospheric and hydroclimatic factors on DOC dynamics in these lakes. Hydrogeological conditions of lake watersheds (e.g., hydrologic connectivity and surficial geology) and seasonal variations in DOM quality jointly shaped the spatiotemporal patterns of the apparent quantum yields of 1O2. Within the euphotic zone, depth-averaged steady-state concentrations of 1O2 were higher in lakes experiencing more intense browning, as operationally defined through trend analyses of long-term water chemistry data; however, the relevance of 1O2-mediated reactions depends on the time scales of photochemical transformation relative to lake flushing. Overall, our study provides an initial assessment of 1O2 production in relation to lake browning and highlights the need for long-term photochemical measurements for an improved assessment.

Maintaining optimal environmental flow in rivers ensures the sustainability of natural ecosystems. An Environmental Flow Assessment (EFA) was conducted in the Terengganu River (outlet) and Petuang River (inlet) to assess whether river flow is sufficient to support ecological and biodiversity needs. The study aimed to develop a hydrological-hydrodynamic model to determine Environmental Flow Values (E-Flow) and to use ecohydrological indicators for restoration and rehabilitation in the Kenyir Lake basin. Sampling was carried out during both the dry and normal seasons. Data were collected on hydrology (water level and river discharge), hydrodynamics (using XPSWMM software), and ecology (fish sampling and Length-Weight Relationship (LWR)). Three sampling stations were selected on each river, with the fish species Toman (Channa micropeltes), Sebarau (Hampala macrolepidota), and Belida (Chitala lopis) chosen as bioindicators. These species were selected based on their size (width, length, and weight), which indicates their tolerance to Environmental Flow Values. A 7Q20 low-flow analysis revealed that in the Terengganu River, the optimum discharge was 42.78 m3/s, with a depth of 3.94 m and a water velocity of 0.54 m/s, supporting the needs of larger fish species. Meanwhile, the Petuang River's optimum discharge was 0.08 m3/s, with a depth of 0.4 m and a water velocity of 0.04 m/s, which could only accommodate small fish species. These low-flow values, with an error margin of less than 20%, were used as inputs in the low-flow analysis. The study highlights the importance of E-Flow in maintaining river health. This holistic assessment, based on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), supports sustainable ecosystem management using green physical structures to optimize environmental flow.

Modeling changes in nutrient retention ecosystem service using the InVEST-NDR model: A case study in the Gumara River of Lake Tana Basin, Ethiopia	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Aquatic ecosystems provide valuable ecosystem services (e.g., habitat for fisheries) to surrounding communities but environmental degradation can diminish the quality of these ecosystem services. The Lake Tana basin, including the Gumara River and its associated wetlands in Ethiopia, has experienced rapid environmental change in the last several decades. Changes in the export of nutrients from the uplands might contribute to the rapid degradation of aquatic ecosystem services due to the expansion of water hyacinths and declines in fish biodiversity and yields. We estimate how human modification and climate change have impacted watershed nutrient retention from 1986 to 2020. Here we (1) examine trends in surface water chemistry, watershed land use/land cover change, and flow alterations; (2) estimate the watershed nutrient delivery ratio (NDR), a metric of watershed nutrient retention, through time; and (3) examine how fishery yields and water hyacinth infestation in Lake Tana at the outlet of the Gumara River change during a period of rapid increase in nutrient export from the Gumara River. Estimates of the surface load and export of both phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) from the Gumara River watershed were approximately stable between 1986 and 2009, but from 2014 to 2020 exports increased by 69 % for P and 80 % for N. Potential factors driving this rapid increase include an expansion in irrigation for agriculture, land conversion to eucalyptus plantations, decreases in dry season flow, and an increase in mean annual precipitation since 2009. In addition, the increase in nutrient export from the Gumara River watershed coincides with a near extirpation of fish in the Gumara River and a ten-fold expansion of water hyacinth downstream in Lake Tana. Human activity and hydrological alteration in the Gumara River watershed have resulted in water quality changes, declines in fish populations, and the expansion of invasive species. Longterm monitoring and watershed modeling can help inform the management of regionally important aquatic ecosystems such as the Gumara River and Lake Tana.

Although short-term interactions between fire and vegetation are well-documented, long-term dynamics remain underexplored. This study examines fire regimes, vegetation dynamics, and its biodiversity over the past 17 000 years in southwest Tanzania, using sedimentary charcoal and pollen. Major ecological transformations of vegetation and fire regimes were recorded, with vegetation changes consistently preceded shifts in fire regimes. Increased grass pollen correlated with more frequent or larger fires, while high tree cover in Miombo woodland reduced fire activity. Interestingly, pollen evenness was a precursor to major ecological transformations as peaks preceded changes in ecosystem states. Changes in precipitation and moisture seems the major top-down drivers of these changes in vegetation and fire. Fire regimes were indirectly controlled by water availability, and vegetation exhibited resilience to fire at centennial timescales before reaching ecosystem shifts at 12 400 and 1700 cal BP. Our results emphasize the critical role of tree and grass cover in shaping fire regimes and highlight the interplay between climate, vegetation structure, and fire in East African ecosystems.

We hypothesized that water quality changes with reduced flow in the dewater area due to hydropower dams in the Marsyangdi and Trisuli rivers of the Gandaki basin. Water quality variables were analyzed from five sampling sites, which included reference, disturbed, and recovery sites, during three seasons covering the post-monsoon (November), base-flow (late February), and pre-monsoon (April) periods during 2021 and 2022. As 60 water samples were collected from the two rivers in each season, with six replicates collected from each station, the total number of samples was 180. Fourteen physicochemical parameters were analyzed: pH, temperature, chloride, electrical conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, free carbon dioxide, calcium and total hardness, nitrate, phosphate, and ammonia. The results revealed that the hydro project dams had an effect on the physicochemical parameters. Most importantly, the site where water was abstracted (the dewater area downstream of the weir) was the most impacted in terms of temperature and dissolved oxygen, which may have effects on aquatic life in both rivers. Higher turbidity and phosphate concentrations also suggest more contamination by pollutants in both rivers. In summary, the diversion hydropower dams impacted the dewater zone, particularly during the base-flow season. The results of this study call for sustainable hydropower developments to maintain mandatory flow release downstream of dams, particularly during the base-flow season.

Phytoplankton, a key element of the mangrove ecosystem, has experienced over 30 occurrences of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the coastal waters of Shenzhen Bay since the 1980s. This study presents an extensive dataset documenting the spatiotemporal variation in phytoplankton communities and associated physicochemical parameters within the FMEP. Over a 3-year period from January 2019 to October 2021, 60 water samples were collected at five distinct stations during seasonal surveys, capturing the salinity gradient. Both spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton community and environmental factors are strongly reflected in our data. Since the dataset was generated using microscopy-based method, it offers precious opportunities for ecological analyses and serves as a valuable reference for biodiversity in future studies, especially in the context of anthropogenic impacts and climate change.

Blue-sky remote sensing technologies present low-cost and effective monitoring techniques for water quality on a large scale. This study was aimed at using readily available Landsat multispectral images to assess the spatial and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass in Nandoni reservoir, Limpopo Province, and at examining the relationships that exist between the physicochemical variables and chl-a concentration. Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI images for June (dry) and December (wet), for the years 2008-2020, were used to derive the distribution of chl-a concentration. Using regression techniques, in situ measured chl-a showed a strong and perfectly linear relationship to the predicted Landsat chl-a in the Nandoni reservoir. There was a negative significant correlation between land use and land cover and water quality variables. Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) analysis, we uncovered significant differences for chl-a concentration in sites, seasons and zones. A significant positive correlation was observed between water temperature and chl-a concentration. In contrast, a strong negative significant correlation was observed for chl-a with salinity and total dissolved solids. chl-a concentration in the Nandoni reservoir was derived using Landsat remote sensing images, suggesting that the Landsat data is suitable for monitoring small reservoirs in a short timescale. The results of this study suggest that remote sensing techniques can be used to control the development of an early warning system for this study and other reservoirs. Furthermore, the results highlight the role of using analysis ready Landsat series data in monitoring phytoplankton biomass and chl-a abundance in freshwater systems.

The research involved samples collected over different times of the year in two subbasins (Sapuca & iacute; and Grande), revealing significant differences in the richness and diversity of zooplankton species, especially during the rainy season. The analysis of functional groups, unlike traditional diversity indices, detected changes in the zooplankton community related to the trophic state. Mesotrophic conditions appear to functionally favor zooplankton, while in eutrophic environments, there is a dominance of opportunistic rotifers. The functional structure of the zooplankton community was characterized by strong intragroup dominance variation, resulting in high functional redundancy. Filter-feeding Cladocera exhibited low tolerance to higher trophic levels, while Rotifera functional groups were representative across all trophic levels. The results indicate that the functional approach provides a more detailed understanding of the resilience and adaptations of the zooplankton community in response to environmental pressures.

The global increase in the frequency and intensity of cyanobacteria blooms has been widely attributed to changes in land-use practices and climate variability, yet little is known of how toxicity has varied historically relative to cyanobacteria abundance. 2. Fossil pigments from cyanobacteria and algae were quantified from shallow lake sediment core records using high-performance liquid chromatography, whilst past concentrations of microcystin congeners were measured using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. These metrics were combined with measures of sedimentary geochemistry (delta C-13, delta N-15, %N, %C, C:N ratio) to estimate how lake production and abundance of toxigenic cyanobacteria varied during the past similar to 300 years in two small lakes in New Brunswick, Canada. Harvey Lake is an impacted site with a history of intensive catchment land use, whilst Wheaton Lake is a relatively undisturbed reference site. 3. Stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis (CONISS) revealed that primary production increased steadily in both lakes since the second half of the 20th century, whilst microcystin production increased by an order of magnitude after ca. 2000 CE. Fossil pigment concentrations were initially lower in Harvey Lake but shifted to more productive conditions after initial forest clearance and settlement and again after agricultural intensification during the 20th century. Although Wheaton Lake exhibited higher overall fossil pigment concentrations, including a pre-colonial eutrophic interval (ca. 1680-1750 CE), this reference basin also underwent enrichment since ca. 1980, possibly reflecting longer growing seasons in the last 50 years. 4. Although cyanobacterial pigments and microcystin concentrations were elevated in sediments deposited since ca. 2000 CE in both lakes, these variables were uncorrelated over the entire 300-year record, with the pre-colonial eutrophic interval in Wheaton Lake having low toxin concentrations. This pattern suggests either that cyanobacterial dominance and toxicity are regulated by different factors or that the preservation of microcystins and pigments is under unique controls. 5. Statistical analyses showed that these small shallow maritime lakes are sensitive to relatively small land-use perturbations within their catchments and that even undisturbed basins may be vulnerable to toxic cyanobacteria blooms in a warming climate.					; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013	McMullin, David/0000-0001-9808-924X; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2025	70	7							e70066	10.1111/fwb.70066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.70066													WOS:001541511100004
J	Hinwood, JB; Mclean, EJ; McMahon, TA				Hinwood, J. B.; Mclean, E. J.; McMahon, T. A.			Water Balance and Evaporation for Two Intermittent Estuarine Lakes	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The management of small intermittently open or closed estuaries (ICOLLs) requires the prediction of lake water levels and the probability of breaching of the entrance barrier in real time, seasonally, and long term. The water balance is a key tool that in turn requires prediction of the open water evaporation. The drivers of the water balance of two ICOLLs on the south-east coast of Australia were studied: The two ICOLLs, Durras Lake and Lake Wollumboola, have very different morphologies: Durras Lake is a drowned stream valley with a largely steep, forested catchment, while Lake Wollumboola is a back-dune lagoon ICOLL with a wider, shallow water body. For these small estuaries, hydrologic and geomorphic data are generally limited or unavailable; hence, methods were developed to use data routinely available, primarily from government agencies, without using regionally averaged or "text book" parameter values. For both lakes, evaporation was shown to be on average larger than either of the inflows from the catchment or from the direct rainfall on the lakes; thus, evaporation must be reliably predicted for use in the water balance. The calculated evaporation agreed with widely used but data-intensive formulas. For each ICOLL a robust linear correlation of lake evaporation with the incident solar radiation accounted for 94% of the variance in the evaporation. The seasonal variation of evaporation fitted a cosine curve, again accounting for 94% of the variance of the evaporation. Validation of the water balances using the evaporation-solar correlation and a derived runoff coefficient provided a close match with the historical record. On most days, the water loss from the lakes by evaporation was larger than the sum of the inflows from catchment runoff and direct rainfall on the lakes. Storms of duration 1-3 days rapidly increased the water storages and the lake levels, potentially leading to breaching of the entrance barrier. This fluctuating balance drives the intermittent behaviour of these ICOLLs and emphasises the importance of accurately assessing the lake evaporation.																			1559-2723	1559-2731				JUL	2025	48	4							93	10.1007/s12237-025-01527-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-025-01527-y													WOS:001459695300001

Seasonal saltwater intrusion during the dry season intensifies the dynamic variations in water quality and salinity between the northern and southern branches of the Yangtze River Estuary, further complicating the ecological processes governing bacterioplankton communities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying these processes and their effects on distinct bacterioplankton sub-communities remain insufficiently explored. In this study, the composition, functions, and assembly mechanisms of bacterioplankton communities in the Yangtze River Estuary during different hydrological periods were examined using molecular technique and various statistical analysis methods. The results showed that rare sub-communities exhibited the highest alpha-diversity, abundant and transient sub-communities primarily contributed to the diversity differences across hydrological periods. Saltwater intrusion into the northern branch altered bacterioplankton community and weakened the distance-decay pattern of the transient and rare sub-communities. Additionally, stochastic processes governed the assembly of rare sub-communities, and saltwater intrusion disrupted their migration and dispersal patterns. In contrast, abundant and transient sub-communities maintain their stability by adjusting their ecological strategies in response to salinity changes. Functional analysis indicated that external nutrient inputs and hydrodynamic changes in the wet season promoted community functional diversity and activity, while abundant subcommunities in the dry season were more effective at occupying resources and performing specific functions related to carbon cycling. These findings highlight the relationships between bacterioplankton sub-communities and environmental changes in estuarine ecosystems, underscoring their key roles in biogeochemical cycling.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				JUL	2025	387								125944	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125944	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125944								40414135					WOS:001500150300001

Despite its importance, there is a lack of information on its geochemical characteristics and the composition of the sediments that accumulate there. This research provides an analysis of the water and sediment quality of Lake Mboli to understand its current state and potential environmental risks. Through fieldwork carried out in February 2020 at the start of the rainy season, we assessed physicochemical parameters and trace metal concentrations in the lake's water column and sediments using field sampling and laboratory analysis. The results indicate that the lake's waters are acidic to slightly acidic (4.34 <= pH <= 6.84), low electrical conductivity (66,750 <= EC <= 79.02 mu S/cm), indicating low mineralization, a slight variation in temperature with an average of 31.03 +/- 0.84 degrees C and an overall oxidizing dissolved oxygen concentration ranging from 3,720 to 6,480 mg/l. Significant ions (HCO3- > NO3- > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > SO42- > Cl- > K+), which helped delineate water typology (Ca-Mg-Cl facies) and minor ions, as well as trace metals (Fe, Al, Cu, Mn, and Cd) were found in varying concentrations at different depths of the water column, with significant implications for aquatic life due to some levels exceeding USEPA guidelines. Multivariate analysis confirms that lake mineralization is dominated by mineral dissolution of cations and anions, while the presence of trace metals is regulated by acidity and geochemical or anthropogenic inputs. Irrigation water quality indices showed that the water is suitable for crop irrigation, except for a few levels in the water column. Geochemical indices (CF, Igeo, PLI) reveal significant contamination of Lake Mboli sediments, with chromium (Cr) showing moderate levels of contamination, indicating an anthropogenic influence, while other metals such as Pb, Zn, Ni, Co and Cd remain at lower levels.

Using Clear Lake, California as a case study, we performed three multidisciplinary analyses to evaluate the socioeconomic impact of HAB water treatment in vulnerable communities. First, a water rate analysis was conducted to determine if there is a relationship between source water quality and water rates. Second, a chemical cost analysis was performed to determine if water treatment costs change with seasonal HABs. Third, a regulatory analysis was performed to determine if adequate funding mechanisms exist to alleviate the financial strain caused by HABs in vulnerable communities. Through these analyses, we found that (1) residents served by Clear Lake water purveyors contributed an average of 3% of their gross monthly income (GMI) toward water bills during the study period, double the threshold for affordable water expenditures; residents of three Clear Lake purveyors paid more than triple the threshold; (2) the chemical cost of water treatment at the Golden State Water Company-Clearlake system (GSWC-CS) increased upward of 34% during HAB season; and (3) current funding mechanisms can be improved to address ongoing operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for contaminants of emerging concern, including cyanotoxins.																			0733-9496	1943-5452				JUL 1	2025	151	7							05025006	10.1061/JWRMD5.WRENG-6549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JWRMD5.WRENG-6549													WOS:001488778600006

Since 2021, natural analogue studies have been conducted to ensure the safety of geological disposal of spent nuclear fuels. The study site experiences two distinct seasons: dry and wet. Using a combination of radon, strontium isotopes, noble gases, microbial community analysis, and flow system modeling, the study examines seasonal variations in groundwater characteristics. Results show that U concentrations are low in subsurface environments under reduced conditions, which is supported by low dissolved oxygen levels and the presence of Pseudomonas and Clostridium genera. In deeper wells, radiogenic 4He was detected, indicating the decay of 238U. The 87Sr/86Sr and 234U/238U activity ratios suggest mixing between water bodies at shallow depths during the wet season, along with longer residence times indicated by radon. Flow velocity was higher during the wet season. Health risks from U exposure were generally low due to limited U mobility, but shallow groundwater was classified as undrinkable, especially during the wet season. The study demonstrates that U mobility is seasonally controlled by hydrological and microbial conditions, highlighting the importance of dual indices-groundwater quality and health risks-for effective water management. These findings are crucial for evaluating the safety of geological disposal of radionuclides under varying hydrological conditions.

Despite its environmental significance, the spatiotemporal dynamics and controlling mechanisms of DOC remain poorly understood due to complex interactions among hydrological, hydrochemical, and environmental factors. Through monthly sampling campaigns (September 2022-February 2024) at the Xiangjiang River-Dongting Lake Wetland confluence, this study investigated groundwater DOC variability and driving factors using integrated machine learning models with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that significantly higher DOC concentrations in groundwater (2.81-48.50 mg L--(1)) compared to surface water (3.05-23.60 mg L--(1)). Groundwater DOC showed a seasonal pattern of decrease during the wet season and increase during the dry season. Spatial analysis revealed DOC concentrations decrease with increasing distance from the riverbank. The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and categorical boosting (CatBoost) models outperformed other algorithms, demonstrating robust predictive capability for DOC variability. SHAP analysis identified NH4+, CODMn, temperature, and electrical conductivity as dominant drivers, while SEM revealed hydrochemical factors exerted the strongest direct control as they can directly reflect the biogeochemical processes between groundwater and aquifer. Meteorological and hydrological factors had a secondary influence through water table fluctuations, while soil factors showed minimal effect because their impact on DOC is typically mediated through indirect pathways involving hydrochemical factors. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for predicting DOC dynamics in groundwater and offer valuable insights for the protection and management of wetland ecosystems.

A total of 26 aquatic macrophytes from 15 families and 20 genera were identified, including 12 species of submerged plants, 5 species of floating-leaved plants, 4 species of free-floating plants, and 5 species of emergent plants. The dominant species were Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton crispus, Stuckenia pectinata, Potamogeton crispus, Potamogeton wrightii, Ceratophyllum demersum, Trapa bispinosa, Nymphoides peltata and Nelumbo nucifera. Myriophyllum spicatum was the most widely distributed species, while Potamogeton maackianus had the highest biomass. Both annual and seasonal variations affected species' biomass and structure. Submerged plants were primarily distributed in the northern part of the lake. Floating-leaved and emergent plants were mainly distributed in the central of the lake. Using Pearson analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA), the relationships between 9 dominant species and 11 physico-chemical parameters were investigated. The results indicated that temperature, pH, water transparency, permanganate index (CODMn), five-day oxygen demand (BOD5), total nitrogen, and total phosphorus had a strong influence on aquatic macrophyte biomass. The results of this study can provide a reference for water ecological health and aquatic macrophyte restoration.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				APR	2025	18	2					360	370		10.1134/S1995082923600461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082923600461		JUL 2025											WOS:001520733300001

Particularly the warm early to middle Eocene (similar to 56-40 million years ago) has become the focus of paleoclimate studies with the intention of quantifying temperatures under high atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) levels. However, detailed proxy reconstructions of land temperature variability during the Eocene "greenhouse" are currently lacking for large parts of the continents. Here we present a similar to 430 thousand-year high-resolution continental temperature record, reconstructed from terrestrial biomarkers preserved in the maar sediments of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Messel Fossil Pit," Germany during the earliest middle Eocene of Central Europe (similar to 47.7-47.2 million years ago). We found that continental temperatures ranged between similar to 21 and 28 degrees C, but shifted from a highly variable (fluctuations up to similar to 5 degrees C) temperature pattern (similar to 155 thousand years) toward a more constant temperature state (similar to 145 thousand years) through the time period covered here. The shift in temperature history was possibly associated with varying orbital configurations or the concurrent initiation of North Atlantic seaway changes. Moreover, we identified a pronounced warming at similar to 47.5 million years, that coincides with negative benthic oxygen and carbon isotopic excursions in the time-equivalent marine stacks, indicating that the maar lake recorded a previously unknown "hyperthermal-like" global warming event.					; Meijer, Niels/AHE-1536-2022	Vasiliev, Iuliana/0000-0002-1024-6966; Schmitt, Clemens/0009-0004-1873-4843													2572-4517	2572-4525				JUL	2025	40	7							e2024PA005047	10.1029/2024PA005047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024PA005047													WOS:001518264200001

A.; Shahat, Ahmed; Hegazy, Mohamed N.; Sewilam, Hani N.; Shoeib, Tamer; Abdelnaser, Anwar			A comprehensive analysis of organochlorine pesticides in Egyptian waters: distribution, ecological impacts, and health risks	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are a pressing global issue, particularly in developing countries like Egypt. These pervasive pesticides pose an environmental and public health concern in Egypt due to their historical use and frequent identification in soils, water bodies, and food products. These present a potential long-term risk to human health and ecosystems. We collected water and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis Niloticus) samples in four Egyptian governorates: Alexandria, Port Said, Ismailia, and Faiyum. Our analysis, through using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, spans 17 OCPs in depth. Our study revealed that certain OCPs, such as Heptachlor, Aldrin, Pentachloronitrobenzene, Heptachlor epoxide, and beta-Endosulfan, are consistently found in higher concentrations among the 17 pesticides tested. Seasonal spikes were identified, particularly in Ismailia, Faiyum, and Alexandria, marking them as environmental risk hotspots. Certain OCPs demonstrated distinctive seasonal variations, such as 4,4 '-DDE in Faiyum. Heptachlor, beta-HCH, Endrin, and alpha-Endosulfan exhibited significant changes solely in Ismailia, while alpha-HCH, Heptachlor epoxide, and gamma-HCH showed unique seasonal patterns only in Alexandria. The risk quotient (RQ) analysis highlighted that Aldrin, Heptachlor, 4,4 '-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, and 2,4 '-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane pose a high environmental risk in all governorates, while 4,4 '- Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane showed high risk only in Port Said (RQ > 1). Several OCPs posed an ecological risk with an RQ > 1. In addition, our results emphasized that there is negligible non-carcinogenic risk associated with dermal water exposure or the consumption of Nile tilapia. There is, however, a minor risk of cancer associated with consuming Nile tilapia or dermal exposure. Therefore, we recommend advocating for strict regulations, implementing monitoring programs, initiating public health initiatives, adopting effective alternatives, developing new remediation approaches, conducting long-term and association studies, and examining the consequences of climate change on the persistence of OCPs in the environment.

Desiree			Modelling the effects of precipitation and temperature on malaria incidence in coastal and western Kenya	MALARIA JOURNAL												BackgroundMalaria continues to plague sub-Saharan Africa despite great efforts geared towards its mitigation. In Kenya alone, 70% of the population remains at risk for malaria every year. Malaria is spread by Anopheles mosquitoes carrying the Plasmodium parasite, and displays a complex ecology with various socio-economic, biophysical factors and meteorological predictors, particularly temperature and precipitation, associated with the occurrence of the disease.MethodsThis study estimated the empirical relationship of temperature and precipitation on the temporal population dynamics of symptomatic malaria cases in Kenyan children living in Ukunda (on Kenyan southern coast), and Kisumu (on Kenyan lake zone) between 2014 and 2022 using daily malaria incidence data collected during a febrile illness surveillance study, merged with daily climatological data collected from ground devices. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to explore the relationship between malaria cases and temperature and precipitation, with Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial distribution and a logarithmic link function. The cross-correlation function assessed the time lags with peak correlations between malaria incidence, precipitation and temperature.ResultsThe data showed 673 positive malaria incident cases amongst children in Kisumu compared to 1209 cases in Ukunda. The results indicate a positive correlation of malaria incidence with rainfall and temperature in Kisumu and a positive correlation between malaria incidence and rainfall and a negative correlation between malaria incidence and temperature in Ukunda. The lags between malaria incidence and rainfall were similar for Kisumu and Ukunda and estimated between 7 and 15 weeks. With a time lag of 15 weeks in Ukunda, GAMM depicted a steady relationship between rainfall and malaria cases until rainfall reaches 150 mm and the relationship between malaria cases and temperature peaks at 26-27 degrees C. In Kisumu using a time lag of 15 weeks in the GAMM, a steady relationship between rainfall and malaria cases was observed until almost 120 mm of rainfall, peaking at 160 mm of rainfall and the relationship between malaria cases and temperature remained steady between 22 and 30 degrees C.ConclusionAssessing the changes in malaria case incidence due to changing seasonality and weather patterns provides policymakers with updated information to strategize malaria control policies.

M.; Izdori, Fides			Analysis of Spatial Variability and Temporal Trends in the Extreme Rainfall of Kagera Sub-Basin, Tanzania	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Understanding the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall extremes is essential for developing effective adaptation strategies and making informed decisions in water resource management, agriculture, and infrastructure development. This study examines the spatial variability and temporal trends of extreme rainfall events in the Kagera sub-basin, using nine climate indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The Sen's slope estimator was used to quantify the magnitude of the trend, whereas the Mann-Kendall (MK) test was applied to evaluate its statistical significance at a significance level of alpha = 0.1. The findings revealed significant trends in the rainfall regime across both annual and seasonal time scales. Annually, consecutive dry days (CDD) showed predominantly negative trends, ranging from -0.24 to -0.1 days/year, whereas consecutive wet days (CWD) generally exhibited positive trends, ranging from 0.16 to 1.0 days/year. Both heavy and very heavy rainfall events, as well as the highest 1- and 5-day rainfall totals, displayed increasing trends, especially in the eastern and central regions of the sub-basin. Seasonally, the results show a decreasing trend in consecutive dry days (CDD) ranging from -0.3 to -0.03 days/year, whereas CWD exhibit an increasing trend, ranging between 0.01 and 0.65 days/year. Both heavy and very heavy rainfall events also exhibited a predominant upward trend. The SPI revealed that the sub-basin experienced periods of severe and extreme drought, particularly between 1991 and 2005. However, there is a notable shift towards wetter conditions, as evidenced by predominantly increasing trends in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month SPI. These findings provide critical insights for developing adaptation strategies to address socio-environmental challenges which are often exacerbated by extreme rainfall events.

However, their constrained spatial resolution imposes limitations, with leakage and attenuation potentially impacting the accuracy of regional TWSA. While GRACE/GFO observations capture the ongoing TWSA decline in the Middle East due to excessive groundwater extraction, the nearby Caspian Sea's long-term water loss, combined with the seasonal signals from the coastal sea, complicate accurate TWSA estimation through signal attenuation and leakage. To address these issues, we propose a combined approach, that is, independent component analysis (ICA)-based forward modeling (IFM), to discern and isolate the leakage effect and improve the recovery of TWSA signal. We demonstrate the impact of signal attenuation and leakage through simulation, and validate the effectiveness of IFM. This method is also confirmed through steric-corrected altimetry estimates in the Caspian Sea, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf, and further validated in Greenland and Victoria Lake. Our results show considerable leakage in GRACE/GFO TWSA estimates for Saudi Arabia and Iran. Leakage from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf introduces a 28.6% bias in Saudi Arabia's TWSA trend, while leakage from the Caspian Sea results in a 36.4% bias in Iran. After IFM recovery, the TWSA decline rates for Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran are 11.48 +/- 0.32, 3.56 +/- 0.44, and 7.75 +/- 0.45 km3/yr, respectively. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of IFM in deriving refined TWSA signal, providing valuable insights for water resource management in arid regions.					; Jiang, Zhongshan/AAU-1457-2021; Xiong, Yuhao/NUP-9993-2025; Chen, Jianli/KUD-8259-2024	Chen, Jianli/0000-0001-5405-8441; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				JUL	2025	61	7							e2024WR039837	10.1029/2024WR039837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR039837													WOS:001528577800001
J	Xu, JL; Wang, HF				Xu, Junli; Wang, Haifeng			Water Quality Variation during Ecological Restoration of a Nonpoint Source Polluted Stream	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Ecological restoration is often used to mitigate nutrient pollution in streams, rivers and lakes. To restore nonpoint-source pollution, an ecological restoration project was initiated in 2012 in the Longhongjian Stream, Hangzhou City, China. Our study was conducted from 2013 to 2015 to evaluate the spatiotemporal water quality variation and assess the efficacy of ecological restoration. We found that nitrogen was the main pollutant in the stream. The nitrogen concentration was higher in the tea plantation- and forest-dominated areas than in other parts of the stream, and the sources were fertilizer, clay soil, and groundwater. The phosphorus concentration also was high in the tea plantation-dominated area, and the source was fertilizer. Due to nonpoint-source pollution, nutrients had higher concentrations in the wet season. After the ecological restoration project, most water quality parameters had a downward tendency, and step ponds played a critical role in retaining nutrients. Removal efficiency analysis showed that water quality was greatly improved, with removal efficiencies (REs) as high as 56.22% of total nitrogen (TN), 62.43% of NO3-& horbar;N, and 65.45% of total phosphorus (TP). Plant uptake was the primary process for nutrient removal in the stream. According to the present study, more attention should be paid to nitrogen retention upstream and phosphorus retention along the tea plantation.																			0733-9372	1943-7870				JUL 1	2025	151	7							05025003	10.1061/JOEEDU.EEENG-7956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JOEEDU.EEENG-7956													WOS:001489262600004

The lake shore was a fluvial-lacustrine landscape shaped by seasonal and long-term transgressions and regressions. However, the basis for linking sedimentary environments to paleolandscapes and pre-Hispanic settlements dynamics is lacking. Thus, we focus in this study on reconstructing sedimentary environments using geochemical and sedimentary facies analyses to study the paleolandscape inhabited by agricultural societies in the Lake Texcoco region. To test this approach, we studied the interface between the San Bernardino and Chapingo Rivers with the lacustrine realm on the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco. We defined sedimentary facies by analyzing their macro and microscopic attributes, as well as using XRD, p-ED-XRF, TOC, C/N, and texture analyses to assess their chemical, mineralogical, and sedimentological characteristics. The combined results allow eleven facies to be assigned to three distinct environments, i.e., lacustrine, transitional fluvial-lacustrine, and fluvial settings. The stratigraphic sections showed a lake transgression with a minimum age of 1293-1242 cal yr BP (657-708 CE) and 1363-1294 cal yr BP (587-656 CE). The absence of archaeological sites in the lower plains during the Late Classic period supports the interpretations of the lake phase. At least two regression phases are interpreted. The first event occurred during the Epiclassic period with a minimum age of 1154-1051 cal yr BP (796-899 CE). The second event has a minimum age of 560-518 cal yr BP (1390-1432 CE), which is consistent with the rise of multiple settlements during the Late Postclassic period. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in settlements during the Postclassic period, probably related to an increase in the variety of natural resources available.

Treatments included control (N0P0), N addition (N1P0), P addition (N0P1), and NP co-addition (N1P1). Using the static chamber method and lab analyses, we measured soil N2O flux and organic carbon content at different growth stages. Results showed that, in the early growing season, short-term N and P addition had no significant effect on soil N2O flux, with all treatments acting as N2O sources. However, N and NP treatments significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, improving carbon sequestration benefits by 72.7% to 98.1%. During the peak growing season, N and NP treatments significantly enhanced soil N2O emissions, while NP treatment further increased SOC storage, the carbon sequestration benefits of all treatments ranging from 49.0% to 56.5%. At the late growing season, N and P addition had no significant impact on soil N2O flux or organic carbon storage, with all sites acting as N2O sinks and SOC storage showing no significant change across treatments (carbon sequestration benefits ranged from 0.3% to 38.5%). The study highlights that the response of soil N2O flux to short-term N and P addition varies at different growth stages, while overall, N and P addition promotes soil carbon sequestration throughout the growing season in the lakeshore zone.					; cao, weijia/AAA-7918-2021	Wen, Lu/0000-0002-2008-362X; 														2071-1050				JUN 29	2025	17	13							5987	10.3390/su17135987	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17135987													WOS:001528233500001

Evaluation of spatio-temporal variation in fish fauna within the Point Calimere Marine Key Biodiversity Area, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Biodiversity loss is expanding at an unprecedented rate, owing to habitat degradation, overexploitation, pollution, and climate change. Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) play an essential role in conservation and spatial planning to reduce the detrimental effects of biodiversity loss. The present study examined the spatio-temporal variations in fish diversity within selected zones of the Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary Key Biodiversity Area (PCWSKBA) from January 2023 to December 2024. In this study, 255 species from 39 orders and 85 families were identified. Escualosa thoracata (Valenciennes, 1847) was the most abundant fish species, comprising 7% of the total number of fish collected, followed by Eleutheronema tetradactylum (Shaw, 1804) (4%) and Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758 (3.8%). The diversity indices revealed that Kodiyakarai Wetland (KW) had the highest species richness and abundance. Simultaneously, the SC recorded lower diversity due to anthropogenic pressure and environmental constraints. The post-monsoon season had the greatest seasonal diversity, which corresponded to the input of nutrients from monsoon rain. The K-dominance curve indicated that the samples from 2023 exhibited a higher concentration of dominance than those from 2024. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that dissolved oxygen, salinity, and phosphate nutrient levels significantly influenced fish distribution across various zones. This study suggests that increasing phosphate and organic matter levels may enhance productivity by promoting algal growth and by providing a food source for fishes. However, excessive nutrient enrichment can lead to eutrophication, depletion of oxygen levels, and promotion of opportunistic species that ultimately disrupt the ecosystem balance. Therefore, it is essential to implement measures to reduce nutrient runoff and organic pollution to prevent oxygen depletion and protect the biodiversity and ecological health of the PCWSKBA. Sustainable land-use practices and enhanced water quality monitoring can help mitigate nutrient overload while preserving the productivity and diversity of aquatic ecosystems.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN 28	2025	197	7							819	10.1007/s10661-025-14210-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-14210-3								40580256					WOS:001518519900002

We study the lightning characteristics of five pyroCb events in British Columbia, Canada, from June 29 to July 1 of 2021, and compare them to other clean and smoke-filled high-based thunderstorms in the same region and season using ground-based lightning detection data, satellite retrievals, meteorological and atmospheric composition reanalysis, and observed thermodynamic profiles. One large pyroCb event over the Sparks Lake fire that generated persistent overshooting tops had a remarkable amount of lightning activity, with 5,600 total lightning strikes, while the rest of the pyroCb events corresponded with lower injection altitudes and minimal to no observed lightning activity. The cloud-to-cloud (CC) to cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning ratio (CC:CG) in this Sparks Lake pyroCb was significantly higher than in other high-based storms but displayed similar lightning density and slightly lower peak current distributions. All clean and smoke-filled thunderstorms produced significant levels of lightning activity, regardless of their cloud-top altitudes. However, ingestion of smoke significantly reduced the percentage of positive polarity CG strikes when compared to clean cases. These results set a reference for identifying the characteristics of pyrogenic lightning and improved predictions of lightning-caused fire ignitions, which will aid in understanding pyroCb activity and related impacts.

Utilizing water vapor diagnosis and calculations, this study determined the water vapor sources and transport paths leading to precipitation in the Dongting Lake basin in four seasons (represented by January, April, June, and October). In January, the water-vapor-generating precipitation originated from the Arabian Peninsula, driven by the southern branch of the westerlies over the southern side of the Tibetan Plateau, along the northern side of the Indian Peninsula through southwestern China to reach the Dongting Lake basin. In April, two transport paths emerged: one aligned closely with the January transport path but with the location shifted slightly northward by 1 degrees of latitude and another driven by the weak subtropical high over the southwestern Pacific, bringing moist air from the western Pacific via the South China Sea and Indochinese Peninsula. In June, the vapor sourced from the northern branch of the southern Indian Ocean subtropical high crossed the Equator and transported through various waterbodies to southwestern China, finally reaching the basin. October saw a water vapor transport path from the western Pacific, crossing the South China Sea and entering the Dongting Lake basin, influenced by the East Asian monsoon system. In different seasons, the variations in water stable isotopes along water vapor transport paths show some agreement with Rayleigh fractionation and water balance principles, as reflected in the model simulations and observations. These findings highlight the impact of atmospheric circulation on precipitation and isotopes, providing a framework for understanding water vapor isotope mechanisms and reconstructing past atmospheric conditions. This research explored how water vapor transports influenced the precipitation isotopes in the Dongting Lake basin in representative months of different seasons. By tracking water vapor from its source regions, we revealed the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation on the transportation of water vapor to the Dongting Lake basin. The changes in water stable isotopes along the water vapor transport paths highlighted the isotopic fractionation and water vapor exchange that occurred along these paths, while the isotopic changes in the precipitation reflect the cumulative influences of water vapor transport on the local precipitation. These comprehensive insights have clarified the influences of atmospheric circulation on water vapor transport and precipitation isotopes and are thus essential for predicting regional precipitation patterns.

Remote sensing-derived turbidity estimates were validated against in-situ measurements. Various statistical analyses, including ANOVA and the Mann-Kendall trend test, were conducted to evaluate seasonal, spatial and long-term turbidity patterns, identifying significant variations and hotspot areas. The results confirm an increasing trend in turbidity over time, raising concerns about its impact on aquatic ecosystems and water quality management. A regression model for turbidity prediction demonstrated a strong agreement between in-situ measurements and MOD09Q1 data (R2 = 0.7869, n = 35). Performance metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE = 82.71 NTU), mean absolute error (MAE = 76.0%) and per cent bias (PBIAS = -2.47%), confirmed the model's accuracy.

To elucidate the structural characteristics of ice crystals and their governing mechanisms in the Inner Mongolia reach, this investigation utilized high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to systematically monitor spatiotemporal variations in open-water formations across diverse channel morphologies throughout the ice regime period. Systematic ice sampling was conducted across diverse channel morphologies of the Yellow River to quantify critical parameters, including crystalline structure characteristics, equivalent diameter distributions, density variations, and sediment content profiles. The results indicate the transformation of open water resulting from various river configurations during the freezing season exhibits distinct characteristics, which are significantly influenced by temperature variations. Ice crystal characterization exhibits that the crystalline structure predominantly manifests as two primary forms: columnar and granular ice formations, with their distribution varying systematically across different channel configurations. Ice crystal morphology exhibits heterogeneity in both form and dimensional characteristics. Columnar ice consistently exhibits larger equivalent diameters compared to granular ice formations. A progressive enhancement in the equivalent diameter of crystals is observed along the vertical axis corresponding to the thickness of the ice during the growth process. The ranges of variation in ice crystal size, ice density, and mud content within ice exhibit differences contingent upon the specific crystal structures present. Observational studies and comparative analyses of ice samples from the Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River reveal that channel morphology, ambient thermal conditions, and hydrodynamic parameters are the primary determinants governing the variability in ice microstructure and its associated physical characteristics. This investigation provides fundamental scientific insights and quantitative data that advance our understanding of river ice microstructural characteristics.																				2073-4441				JUN 26	2025	17	13							1898	10.3390/w17131898	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17131898													WOS:001526087600001

The study assesses the land use/land cover changes and water spread dynamics of a tropical reservoir using Landsat images from 2000, 2010, and 2020, as well as Sentinel images from 2019 to 2022. Supervised classification, normalized difference water index, water presence frequency methodologies were used for change detection, assessing the water spread and fish culture area. The study showed a significant increase in settlement area from 2000 to 2020 as most of the vegetative lands were converted into settlement areas. The study suggests that around 0.49 million fingerlings are needed to make the best use of the water available in the Peechi reservoir, which could yield a fish production potential of 196.45 metric tonnes. In the Peechi reservoir, the area suitable for cage (annual water spread) and pen culture (seasonal water spread) is estimated to be 310.22 ha (34.63%) and 30.40 percent (272.25 ha) respectively. The framework builds from the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) based mapping and can be useful to the policy makers, researchers, academicians, fisheries department officials to institute appropriate development plans and aids in prioritising reservoirs with fish culture potential. The proposed framework can be used to assess change detection in and around any reservoir over a period, to estimate effective water spread area and stocking density for scientific ranching, and to identify potential fish culture sites.																			0255-660X	0974-3006				2025 JUN 26	2025										10.1007/s12524-025-02206-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-025-02206-y		JUN 2025											WOS:001518079300001

The YLB has experienced remarkable land use/land cover change (LUCC) and climate change (CC) in recent years. To understand the drivers of the streamflow change in this basin, the effects of the land use change and climate variation on the temporal flow variability were studied using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The calibration and validation results indicated that the SWAT simulated the streamflow well. Then the streamflow responses to the land use change between 2010 and 2020 and climate change with future climate projections (SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) were evaluated. Results showed that the LUCC in the YLB caused a marginal decline in the annual streamflow at the whole basin scale but significantly altered rainfall-runoff relationships and intra-annual discharge patterns; e.g., monthly streamflows decreased by up to 3% in the dry season under the surface modification, with subbasins of the YLB exhibiting divergent responses attributed to spatial heterogeneity in land surface transitions. Under future climate scenarios, streamflow projections revealed general declining trends with significant uncertainties, particularly under high-emission pathways, e.g., SSP370 and SSP585, in which the streamflow could be projected to reduce by up to 5.9% in the mid-future (2031-2045). In addition, droughts were expected to intensify, exacerbating seasonal water stress in the future. It suggests that integrated water governance should synergize climate-resilient land use policies with adaptive infrastructure to address regional water resources challenges.																				2073-4441				JUN 25	2025	17	13							1890	10.3390/w17131890	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17131890													WOS:001526084100001

The specimen, collected from a rhythmite bed of gray-black shale at Fazenda Santa F & eacute; (Trememb & eacute;, S & atilde;o Paulo), is a well-preserved, small digitigrade track that exhibiting a classic anisodactyl pattern with distinct impressions of digits I-IV, including a posteriorly oriented hallux. Morphological analysis confidently assigns the track to the shorebird-associated ichnogenus Ardeipeda Panin and Avram, 1962, significantly expanding its know paleobiogeographic range. Two associated avian coprolites from the same horizon exhibit a phosphatized composition and undigested prey remains. Sedimentological analysis indicates alternating laminated and massive bedding, consistent with seasonal lake-level fluctuations in a lacustrine setting. Subaerial exposure and cohesive clay substrates facilitated the exceptional preservation of these delicate traces. This discovery fills a critical gap in Brazil's avian ichnofossil record and provides new insights into Oligocene shorebird habitats and taphonomic processes in rift basin lakes.

J	Joseph, AM; Gandhi, MS				Joseph, Anju Maria; Gandhi, M. Suresh			Seasonal impact of river influx on the textural characteristics of Vembanad Lake sediments, Kerala, India	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS												The proximity to river channels significantly influences the distribution of lacustrine sediments, as these channels act as primary conduits for sediment transport. The current study was conducted to understand the seasonal effects of six river influxes on Vembanad Lake sediment texture. A comparison of two seasons-the pre-monsoon season in March 2023 and the post-monsoon season in September 2023-was used to examine changes in textural parameters. Various parameters, including graphic mean size, graphic standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis, were measured to provide a thorough assessment of the granulometry of lake and river sediments. The Pejrup ternary diagram has been employed to understand the research area's hydrodynamic dynamic condition. The degree of freedom among different factors has been determined by bivariate plotting, and the environment and the deposition process have been examined and distinguished using a linear discriminant function. It is evident from the studies on textural characteristics that fine-grain sediments covered the southern part of the lake while towards the northern region the percentage of sand-size sediments are steadily increased. The proportion of fine-grained sediments is higher in the Pampa and Achenkovil rivers, while the sand percentage is greater in the other four rivers. The textural nomenclature of the sediments typically follows the sequence of sand-sized sediments, followed by fine-grained sediments. The hydrodynamic conditions of the sediment deposition in the area indicate that the sediments are deposited in environments ranging from calm to violent. The frequency distribution curves of the study area indicate the polymodal nature of the sediments, but specific locations showed unimodal and bimodal sediment characteristics. The pre-monsoon and post-monsoon textural parameters of the Vembanad Lake samples showed medium sand and fine sand, respectively, with moderately sorted, symmetrically skewed, and mesokurtic sediments. The Pamba River is unique compared to other inflows because of its extremely fine sand concentration, moderately well-sorted, extremely coarse skewness, and mesokurtic sediments. According to the bivariate plots of the study area, all the examined samples were deposited in the fluvial environment. Linear Discriminant Function analysis indicated that the sediments were deposited mostly in a shallow marine agitated environment and the remaining fluvial process. Apart from the seasonal fluctuations, the primary determinants of the sediment texture difference between the northern and southern regions of the lake are the fluvial sedimentological attributes of the rivers that join with it.																			2662-5571	2447-9462				2025 JUN 24	2025										10.1007/s43217-025-00250-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43217-025-00250-9		JUN 2025											WOS:001514262700001

The lake stratigraphy is punctuated by turbidites, with characteristics typical of those triggered by earthquake shaking as seen in other lakes worldwide. Sediments deposited in Ozette Lake over the past 1300 years between earthquake events show decadal-scale variations in color, magnetic susceptibility, clay content, organic carbon content, density, and computed tomography (CT) intensity. Applying the dynamic time warping technique reveals a strong correlation of CT intensity to historical, instrumental measurements of regional cool-season precipitation, indicating that sediments in the lake preserve a high-fidelity record of decadally averaged fluvial sediment discharge and climate. Correlation of CT intensity patterns from older strata preserved deeper in the lake stratigraphy to two independent, regional paleo-precipitation reconstructions similarly suggests that the sediments record decadal variations in hydroclimate. We provide radiocarbon-independent dates for the past four northern Cascadia subduction earthquakes that are within the uncertainty of a radiocarbon age-depth model but are more precisely estimated by placing earthquake-triggered turbidites in the context of wet and dry periods in these tree-ring- and oxygen-isotope-based reconstructions. Paleoclimate-based constraints on the age of event layers in this and other regional lakes have the potential to help address ongoing questions about past ruptures on the Cascadia subduction margin.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				SEP	2025	127						90	106		10.1017/qua.2025.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2025.19		JUN 2025											WOS:001514066600001

Ahmad; Shimul, Shahida Arfine			Spatiotemporal dynamics of water and sediment characteristics in Kaptai Lake: implications for sustainable management	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Kaptai Lake, the largest artificial lake in Southeast Asia, holds global ecological significance due to its rich biodiversity. Although created for hydroelectric power generation, it is now home to about 74 fish species and other aquatic organisms that support small-scale fisheries and contribute to the socioeconomic development of local communities. Therefore, the study focuses on assessing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the water and sediment characteristics of Kaptai Lake to provide baseline information for its sustainable management. Twelve months of sampling was done at four stations of the lake. Water parameters such as water temperature (WT), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), alkalinity, hardness, carbon dioxide (CO2) and ammonia, and soil parameters such as organic carbon and organic matter were determined. Statistical analysis showed that alkalinity and CO2 varied among the sampling stations (p < 0.05), while WT, DO, TDS, alkalinity, organic carbon, and organic matter showed significant variation across the sampling season (p < 0.05). Seasonal variation in Kaptai Lake was more noticeable than spatial variation, as the lake's uniformity limited spatial differences. However, water and sediment characteristics varied significantly over time. Multivariate analyses, such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), revealed that alkalinity, TDS, and hardness influence variability while grouping stations and seasons. This research generated baseline information on the spatiotemporal dynamics of Kaptai Lake, offering critical insights for its sustainable management.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN 24	2025	197	7							798	10.1007/s10661-025-14231-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-14231-y								40553204					WOS:001515186200001

Climate buffering effects of western Canadian boreal lakes: the effect of lake size and depth on shoreline and nearshore forests	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												ContextLakes can provide thermal refugia effects by buffering shoreline and inland temperatures, potentially delaying forest transitions. However, this effect has not been quantified for the majority of boreal Canada lakes, which are often excluded in general circulation model predictions of climate, thus potentially underestimating the effects of lake-mediated buffering.ObjectivesHere, we quantify the effects of varying lake morphometry on temperature buffering potential of 11 boreal lakes in central to western Canada. We aim to provide context for lake-mediated climate buffering in Canada's boreal forest.MethodsWe established inland transects at 11 lakes in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the NWT of Canada, with temperature stations at 10 m, 100 m, 1 km, 10 km, and 100 km from shore. We predicted the effects of lake characteristics on mean July temperature anomaly, net ice-off period temperature anomaly, and the proportion of coniferous trees at sites.ResultsJuly temperatures were coolest on the downwind side of lakes, within 10 km of shore, and at lakes with a high volume (R2c = 0.71), Near-shore sites were cooler than inland sites, particularly at a lower altitude above the lake and larger lake volumes (R2c = 0.66). Ice-off temperature anomalies were best predicted by the interaction between lake area and average lake depth (R2c = 0.55). Lastly, the proportion of coniferous trees at sites was best predicted by mean July temperature (R2c = 0.41).ConclusionsWe identified lakes across boreal Canada large enough to provide seasonal temperature buffering on their shoreline and nearshore forests, with an aim for inclusion in circulation models and to guide management and conservation efforts associated with lake-mediated climate refugia.

While urban flood resilience (UFR) has emerged as a critical framework for flood risk management, existing studies often overlook the systemic integration of post-disaster recovery capacity and multidimensional interactions in UFR assessment. This study develops a novel hazard-vulnerability-exposure-defense capacity-recovery capacity (HVEDR) framework to address research gaps. We employ a hybrid game theory combined weight method (GTCWM)-TOPSIS approach to evaluate UFR in China's Taihu Lake Basin (TLB), a region highly vulnerable to monsoon- and typhoon-driven floods. Spanning 1999-2020, the analysis reveals three key insights: (1) weight allocation via GTCWM identifies defense capacity (0.224) and hazard (0.224) as dominant dimensions, with drainage pipeline density (0.091), flood-season precipitation (0.087), and medical capacity (0.085) ranking as the top three weighted indicators; (2) temporal trends show an overall upward trajectory in UFR, interrupted by a sharp decline in 2011 due to extreme hazard events, with Shanghai and Hangzhou exhibiting the highest UFR levels, contrasting Zhenjiang's persistently low UFR; (3) spatial patterns reveal stronger UFR in southern and eastern areas and weaker resilience in northern and western regions. The proposed HVEDR framework and findings provide valuable insights for UFR assessments in other flood-prone basins and regions globally.

The identity of Oncorhynchus rhodurus Jordan and McGregor in Jordan and Hubbs 1925, often previously applied to the new species, is shown to differ from the latter. Similarly, O. ishikawae, also previously confused with the new species, is confirmed as Amago salmon.

East Taihu Lake, a typical shallow lake in China, has experienced severe ecological stress due to nutrient enrichment and habitat alteration. We investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of macroinvertebrate communities to assess the degree of disturbance to aquatic ecosystems. Seasonal sampling was conducted across five functional areas from 2020 to 2021, including measurements of physicochemical water parameters, aquatic vegetation, and macroinvertebrate assemblages. A total of 28 species were identified, with Bellamya purificata, Limnodrilus, and Tubifex as dominant taxa. Statistical analyses revealed that water depth and aquatic vegetation coverage were the key drivers shaping community composition and diversity. Mollusks dominated in shallow, vegetated areas with high transparency, while Oligochaetes and Chlamydia were more abundant in deeper waters, reflecting tolerance to low-oxygen and eutrophic conditions. This study highlights the ecological benefits of aquatic vegetation in enhancing habitat complexity, supporting macroinvertebrate diversity, and improving water quality. These findings provide valuable scientific support for adaptive management of shallow lakes, emphasizing the restoration of aquatic plants and regulation of hydrological conditions as effective strategies to promote benthic biodiversity and longterm ecosystem resilience.

This study investigated the spatial-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages and corresponding limnological variables in ten reservoirs across Niger State, Nigeria, over two consecutive hydrological seasons (wet and dry) spanning June 2019 to March 2021. Multivariate statistical analyses, including two-way ANOVA, demonstrated significant spatial and seasonal variability in physical and chemical water parameters (p < 0.05). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) elucidated key environmental drivers shaping phytoplankton community structure, revealing strong correlations with nutrient concentrations and organic loading indicators. Application of the Palmer Algal Index (PAI) facilitated quantitative assessment of organic pollution gradients, corroborating phytoplankton as sensitive bioindicators of trophic status and ecosystem integrity. The results underscore the imperative for integrative monitoring and management frameworks to mitigate eutrophication and preserve aquatic biodiversity within these reservoirs, contributing to sustainable water resource management in Nigeria.

Compared with flooding, the drying (50% WHC and 80% WHC) treatments sharply increased CO2 emission in the topsoil, but slightly decreased in the subsoil. SOC decomposition rates declined dramatically by day 153, then gradually reduced with more labile C decomposed, as cumulative SOC decomposition amounts were negatively correlated with DOC content, and the abundances of Actinobacteria and Firmicute increased after incubation in the topsoil. The Q10-labile was significantly lower than the Q10-recalcitrant in both soil depths. When converted from flooding to drying, subsoil Q10 values increased and continued to increase during the incubation, but topsoil Q10 was decreased before 5% of total SOC was depleted, then increased and was higher than the flooding treatments finally.ConclusionOur findings showed that a combination of warming and drying would exacerbate SOC decomposition in the topsoil, but have a minor impact on the subsoil carbon pool of the Poyang Lake wetland.

Long-term changes in dissolved organic matter quality are unrelated to ecosystem recovery from acidification in the Adirondack region (New York, USA)	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Increasing concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and changing dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality in surface waters, a phenomenon known as browning, have been observed at global scales with a range of implications for ecosystem structure and function, global carbon cycling and human health. Ecosystem recovery from chronic acidification resulting from rapid declines in acid deposition over recent decades has been the leading explanation for surface water browning. In this study, long-term dynamics of the quantity, quality, and seasonality of DOM in surface waters of an acid-resistant Adirondack lake and its forested watershed were investigated during a period of rapid regional changes in both acidic deposition and climate (1999-2018). Overall, we found that trends in DOM quality have occurred while the overall quantity and seasonality of DOC fluxes changed little during the same time frame. Lack of DOC trends was consistent with expectations for this acid-resistant ecosystem. Model reconstructions of DOM quality during this period indicated shifts towards a greater proportion of terrestrially-sourced DOM from the watershed, but with occasional 'pulses' of more microbially-processed DOM associated with periods of heavy rainfall and high discharge. Our findings suggest that ecologically meaningful changes in DOM quality may be occurring in acid-resistant ecosystems, aside from trends in DOC driven by ecosystem recovery from acid impairment.

In the Five Lakes of Mikata-goko (western Japan), creation and restoration projects for nature-based coastal protection (semi-natural coastal habitats) have recently been implemented and initiated by the Nature Restoration Committee; however, their outcomes in terms of biodiversity have yet to be evaluated. In this study, spatiotemporal changes in macrozoobenthic assemblages were examined to provide insights into coastal habitat restoration using local knowledge (LK). Natural forces (winds and waves) were used to replenish sand along a sand-starved shoreline in the LK-based practice. The restored shallow-water habitat realized seasonally stable species richness and higher annual richness of brackish-water macrozoobenthic assemblages dominated by previously prevalent species, the Shijimi clam (Corbicula japonica) and the nereid polychaeta (Hediste atoka) compared with adjacent deep, unrestored sites. The changes in assemblage structure were likely due to seasonally stable low-salinity (mesohaline) and oxygen-rich conditions (dissolved oxygen concentration >5 mg L-1), owing to the shallow water depth in the restored habitat. The results suggest that the beach nourishment practice partially and successfully mitigated historical habitat loss in the lakes and, hence, can provide suggestions for future mitigation practices of coastal habitat loss in estuaries.

Effects of flooding on aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure on a connected and disconnected regulated river floodplain	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Atchafalaya River Basin is the largest continuously forested floodplain in the United States. This ecosystem has been heavily modified for flood control and human use, often with minimal study into ecological effects on resident biota. As part of modifications, sections of the historic floodplain have been disconnected from the annual flood pulse via an extensive levee system. We examined the influence of the annual flood pulse on aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, with an emphasis on Hemiptera, by sampling a connected floodplain and a disconnected floodplain lake across two flood pulses of varying magnitude in 2018 and 2019. On the connected floodplain, flooding-related changes to temperature, dissolved oxygen, and water depth were important factors differentiating early flood and late-flood assemblages. Disconnected floodplain insect assemblages greatly differed from connected floodplain by 50% of taxa, lower richness, and lower densities of 21 of 24 taxa shared between both floodplains. Flooding magnitude between years delayed development of the late-flood assemblage later into the flood pulse. Results suggest, in terms of aquatic insect abundance and composition, aerial dispersal from adjacent (< 100 m) floodplain areas cannot replace loss of direct river connectivity. Further, restoration of riverine flooding is important for re-establishing aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in disconnected floodplains.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				2025 JUN 16	2025										10.1007/s10750-025-05921-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-025-05921-2		JUN 2025											WOS:001509429700001

Carbon sequestration capacity of a prairie pothole wetland under warm and dry conditions	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Prairie Pothole wetlands have large temporal changes in water status. The wetlands are often flooded, with water above the soil surface during the early growing season, while becoming dry during the later growing season or for years under strong drought. We used the eddy covariance technique to assess the potential for ecosystem carbon sequestration as a natural climate solution in a large Prairie Pothole wetland in southern Alberta (Frank Lake wetland complex) that was dominated by the emergent macrophyte, Schoenoplectus acutus L. (bulrush). We made ecosystem-scale measurements of CO2 and CH4 exchange over two growing seasons during a time-period with environmental conditions that were warmer and drier than the climate normal. In particular, the study was conducted while the wetland had been experiencing a decade-long drought based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index. To provide perspective on the longer-term temporal variability of ecosystem carbon exchange processes, we also used LandSat NDVI measurements of vegetation greenness, calibrated with eddy covariance measurements of ecosystem CO2 exchange during 2022-23, to estimate carbon sequestration capacity during 1984-2023, a period that included several wet-dry cycles. Our measured growing season-integrated net CO2 uptake values were 47 and 70 g C m-2 season-1 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Including the measured low methane emissions (converted to CO2 equivalents based on a Sustained Global Warming Potential) only changed the net sink to 40 and 67 g C m-2 season-1 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Despite drought conditions over the last decade, measured ecosystem carbon sequestration values were close to average values during 1984-2023, based on NDVI measurements and model carbon flux calculations. Our results demonstrated net carbon sequestration as a natural climate solution in a Prairie Pothole wetland, even during a time-period that was not expected to be favourable for carbon sequestration because of the drought conditions.

However, the processes affecting water ecology under climate change remain poorly understood. This study investigates, for the first time, the effects of regional warming on three high-mountain lakes, Sulzata, Okoto and Bubreka, located in the Rila Mountains, Bulgaria, by examining shifts in bacterial metabolic capacity in relation to the rate and range of utilizable carbon sources using the Biolog EcoPlate (TM) assay. Over the last decade, ice-free water temperatures in the lakes have risen by an average of 2.6 degrees C, leading to increased nutrient concentrations and enhanced primary productivity, particularly in the shallowest lake. Bacterial communities responded to these changes by increasing their metabolic rates and shifting substrate preferences from carbohydrates to carboxylic acids. While the utilization rates of some carbon sources remained stable, others showed significant changes-some increased (e.g., D-galactonic acid gamma-lactone and itaconic acid), while others decreased (e.g., alpha-D-lactose and D-xylose). The most pronounced effects of warming were observed in June, coinciding with the onset of the growing season. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may substantially alter bacterial metabolic potential, contributing to a long-term positive feedback loop between lake nutrient cycling and climate change.

J	Lei, K; Zhang, LL; Gao, LM				Lei, Ke; Zhang, Lele; Gao, Liming			Evaluation of IMERG Precipitation Product Downscaling Using Nine Machine Learning Algorithms in the Qinghai Lake Basin	WATER												High-quality precipitation data are vital for hydrological research. In regions with sparse observation stations, reliable gridded data cannot be obtained through interpolation, while the coarse resolution of satellite products fails to meet the demands of small watershed studies. Downscaling satellite-based precipitation products offers an effective solution for generating high-resolution data in such areas. Among these techniques, machine learning plays a pivotal role, with performance varying according to surface conditions and algorithmic mechanisms. Using the Qinghai Lake Basin as a case study and rain gauge observations as reference data, this research conducted a systematic comparative evaluation of nine machine learning algorithms (ANN, CLSTM, GAN, KNN, MSRLapN, RF, SVM, Transformer, and XGBoost) for downscaling IMERG precipitation products from 0.1 degrees to 0.01 degrees resolution. The primary objective was to identify the optimal downscaling method for the Qinghai Lake Basin by assessing spatial accuracy, seasonal performance, and residual sensitivity. Seven metrics were employed for assessment: correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), standard deviation ratio (Sigma Ratio), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and bias. On the annual scale, KNN delivered the best overall results (KGE = 0.70, RMSE = 17.09 mm, Bias = -3.31 mm), followed by Transformer (KGE = 0.69, RMSE = 17.20 mm, Bias = -3.24 mm). During the cold season, KNN and ANN both performed well (KGE = 0.63; RMSE = 5.97 mm and 6.09 mm; Bias = -1.76 mm and -1.75 mm), with SVM ranking next (KGE = 0.63, RMSE = 6.11 mm, Bias = -1.63 mm). In the warm season, Transformer yielded the best results (KGE = 0.74, RMSE = 23.35 mm, Bias = -1.03 mm), followed closely by ANN and KNN (KGE = 0.74; RMSE = 23.38 mm and 23.57 mm; Bias = -1.08 mm and -1.03 mm, respectively). GAN consistently underperformed across all temporal scales, with annual, cold-season, and warm-season KGE values of 0.61, 0.43, and 0.68, respectively-worse than the original 0.1 degrees IMERG product. Considering the ability to represent spatial precipitation gradients, KNN emerged as the most suitable method for IMERG downscaling in the Qinghai Lake Basin. Residual analysis revealed error concentrations along the lakeshore, and model performance declined when residuals exceeded specific thresholds-highlighting the need to account for model-specific sensitivity during correction. SHAP analysis based on ANN, KNN, SVM, and Transformer identified NDVI (0.218), longitude (0.214), and latitude (0.208) as the three most influential predictors. While longitude and latitude affect vapor transport by representing land-sea positioning, NDVI is heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities and sandy surfaces in lakeshore regions, thus limiting prediction accuracy in these areas. This work delivers a high-resolution (0.01 degrees) precipitation dataset for the Qinghai Lake Basin and provides a practical basis for selecting suitable downscaling methods in similar environments.																				2073-4441				JUN 13	2025	17	12							1776	10.3390/w17121776	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17121776													WOS:001514651700001

However, its genesis remains relatively understudied. Based on core descriptions and thin-section analyses, this study investigates the occurrence types and genetic mechanisms of gypsum in the Bottom Sandstone Member of the northern Tabei Uplift. Five types of gypsum occurrences are identified: layered gypsum, gypsum clasts, spotted gypsum, gypsum nodules, and a mixed deposition of clastic rocks and gypsum. The mixed deposition of clastic rocks and gypsum includes gypsiferous mudstone, muddy gypsum, gypsiferous mudstone containing muddy clasts, and sandy gypsum. Layered gypsum, spotted gypsum, gypsiferous mudstone, and muddy gypsum mainly result from in situ chemical precipitation during periods of high evaporation and reduced runoff. In contrast, gypsum clasts, gypsiferous mudstone containing muddy clasts, and sandy gypsum reflect processes of transportation and reworking induced by flood events. Seasonal variations in hydrodynamic conditions play a critical role in the formation and distribution of gypsum. During dry periods, surface runoff weakens or ceases, and the salinity of lake water or pore water in clastic deposits increases due to intense evaporation, promoting gypsum precipitation. During flood periods, increased runoff can erode previously formed gypsum, which is subsequently transported and deposited as gypsum clasts. The morphology of gypsum varies with its transport distance. These findings enhance our understanding of clastic-evaporite mixed systems in arid continental lacustrine settings and provide insights into sedimentary processes influenced by seasonal climatic fluctuations.

Despite these overwhelming threats, there is limited research as evidenced by the underrepresentation of Africa-based data in global ecological and biochemical models. This review, therefore, aims to highlight key challenges and existing research gaps, particularly in Ugandan freshwater ecosystems. We focus on lake microbiology as this scientific field has been greatly underrepresented. Aquatic microorganisms are situated at the base of lake food webs and thus play crucial roles in the evolution and maintenance of water quality, attenuation of pollutants, and control of biogeochemical cycling through the microbial loop. Until now, the microbiology of Ugandan lakes has not been systematically studied. Thus, many open fundamental microbial ecology questions need to be urgently addressed to generate valuable information to advance future research, education, management and policy in Uganda and beyond. These include, but are not limited to: identification of microbial taxa and functional genes in relation to anthropogenic and climatic influence; seasonal and spatial variation in species diversity and functions; diversity and functions of planktonic, sediment, biofilm and mat communities; antimicrobial resistance burden; plastisphere communities; and geomicrobiology.

This study evaluated PFAS concentrations in drinking water, wastewater, and surface water in Reykjavik, Iceland, focusing on seasonal variability and potential pollution sources. Thirty-three samples from groundwater, wastewater, and surface water were analysed for up to 54 PFAS. Results reveal that PFAS concentrations in Reykjavik's drinking water were minimal, which most compounds below detection limits, and the sum of 18 PFAS below 0.5 ng L-1. These levels were significantly below EU Drinking Water Directive and European Food Safety Authority health limits, indicating effective source water protection. In contrast, elevated PFAS levels were detected in wastewater and surface water, with concentrations reaching 14 ng L-1 for sum 18 PFAS. The most prevalent compound was perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). The highest contamination occurred at firefighting training sites, particularly at Reykjavik Airport, where PFAS concentrations exceeded 2000 ng L-1, dominated by PFOS. A comparison to prior results implied an about 10-fold decrease of PFOS in Reykjavik's wastewater treatment plant since 2017. These findings emphasize the need for continued monitoring, and further investigation into historical and active contamination sources to safeguard environmental and public health in Iceland. Given the presence of PFAS-contaminated sites in Iceland, targeted PFAS management strategies are needed to prevent contamination of drinking water resources.

The abundance of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in aquatic systems serves as a reliable ecological indicator of lake water quality that is strongly correlated to the degree of eutrophication. Using multi-source remote sensing data - including Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery - and employing Theil-Sen median analysis, the Mann-Kendall trend test, and Pearson correlation analysis, we comprehensively examined the spatial and temporal dynamics, as well as the driving forces, of Chl-a concentrations in medium and large lakes (lake area >10 km(2)) across China from 1986 to 2023. The results showed that, over the past four decades, Chl-a concentration in Chinese lakes generally exhibited a declining trend, with a more pronounced decrease occurring after 2013. Significant regional disparities were observed: lakes in the southwestern region demonstrated the most pronounced declines, while those in the southern region exhibited the least. Seasonal variability in Chl-a was consistent across the country, with concentrations peaking between July and August and reaching their lowest levels from November to March. Nevertheless, the extent of seasonal variation differed regionally, being lower in western China and greater in the eastern and southern regions. Land surface temperature, water vapor content, and soil moisture showed strong positive correlations with Chl-a concentrations, while elevation and wind speed displayed negative correlations. These relationships also varied significantly in geographic subregions. Overall, the study revealed the spatiotemporal patterns and driving mechanisms of Chl-a dynamics in Chinese lakes and highlighted the spatial heterogeneity of ecological and geographical influences on Chl-a concentrations.

J	Wu, B; Wang, WP; Wang, YH; Zhang, ZH				Wu, Bin; Wang, Weiping; Wang, Yuehua; Zhang, Zhihong			Population Viability Analysis Revealed the Vulnerability of Yangtze Finless Porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) in Poyang Lake	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Poyang Lake in China is the most critical habitat and final refuge for the Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis), YFP. In 2022, its population reached approximately 492 individuals, an increase of 35 from the 457 individuals recorded in 2017, showing a steady upward trend. The infrequent movement of YFPs between Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River represents a considerable threat to the long-term viability of this population. Additionally, serious water shortages in the lake during the dry season have led the government to consider the establishment of a hydraulic project. Therefore, a reliable risk assessment and quantitative analysis of conservation scenarios are urgently needed for this population. Population viability analysis of the YFP population in Poyang Lake was conducted using the VORTEX software. The baseline model predicted a probability of extinction of 0.241 over the next 100 years, with no probability of extinction in the first 30 years; the genetic diversity would be on a continuous downward trend and decline by 91.5%. The comprehensive protection model predicted a probability of extinction of 0.0028 and that the genetic diversity would be maintained at about 0.996 in 100 years. Breeding rate, sex ratio at birth, mortality rate, and gene flow were the factors that were sensitive to maintaining population viability. The results showed that the population of YFPs in Poyang Lake was at a high risk of extinction due to the decline in genetic diversity and the higher mortality and lower birth rate caused by habitat degradation. A total ban on productive fishing and the rescue and interchange of YFPs are conducive to enhancing the viability of the YFP population in Poyang Lake.

J	Cilbiz, M; Korkmaz, B; Bolat, Y				Cilbiz, Mehmet; Korkmaz, Bayram; Bolat, Yildiz			Commercial vs. survey data in length-based stock assessment: insights from Turkish crayfish fisheries	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												In length-based stock assessments for data-poor fisheries, commercial fishing data is often used due to its cost-effectiveness and accessibility. However, factors such as gear selectivity, seasonal closures, minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) regulations, and market-driven harvesting practices can render commercial catch data unrepresentative of the true population structure. Reliance on such data without correction or complementary sampling may lead to biased stock assessments, undermining effective fisheries management. This study investigates how length data from commercial fisheries and experimental sampling influence the estimation of biological reference points (BRPs) and explores differences in catch compositions between these data sources. Between June 2021 and May 2022, a study was conducted at Lake E & gbreve;irdir (Isparta, T & uuml;rkiye), involving 10 different stations. A total of 400 fyke nets were deployed, consisting of 200 experimental and 200 commercial ones. The experimental fyke nets had a stretched mesh size of 18 mm, while the commercial ones had a mesh size of 34 mm. These nets were evenly distributed, with 40 nets at each station. TropFishR package was used for estimating of the life history parameters and stock assessment. The comparison of catch composition was performed using "Length-dependent catch comparison" and "catch ratio" analyses through the SELNET program. As a result, it has been determined that, due to the potential size selectivity feature, the commercial fyke net is unsuccessful in catching small-sized individuals (<4 cm carapace length), while the experimental fyke net is unsuccessful in catching advanced-sized crayfish (>6.5 cm carapace length). The estimated BRPs showed significant differences depending on the data source, and there were also differences of up to 56% in the recommended total allowable catch (TAC) amounts. As a result, it is considered that relying solely on commercial or experimental fyke nets for crayfish may be misleading, and it would be more appropriate to use both for successful sampling and stock assessment.

An aquatic mesocosm array to regulate spatial and temporal water temperature variability	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Temporal and spatial variability in temperature are key habitat features that will determine individual, population, and community-level responses to global climate warming. Lakes and ponds exhibit thermal heterogeneity in the form of diel and seasonal fluctuations as well as vertical stratification; however, experimental studies of warming in these ecosystems have largely focused on elevated mean temperatures within thermally homogeneous settings. Thus, new tools are needed to incorporate temperature variability into aquatic mesocosm experiments. We present a design for a mesocosm array to simulate lentic environments with different magnitudes of spatial and temporal temperature variability. Each mesocosm consists of a 77-L plastic container heated by two independent band heaters, where water temperature is regulated via a programmable logic controller that receives feedback from thermocouples. We find that the controller is capable of producing high temperatures (> 35 degrees C) and substantial thermal stratification, with low variability between replicate mesocosms. We generated a vertical temperature gradient up to 12.4 degrees C across 54 cm of water depth and diel fluctuations up to 12.2 degrees C in the surface layer (top 14 cm). We additionally demonstrate the utility of the mesocosm array for other common applications, including temperature ramps and real-time transformations of ambient temperature time series. The control system's ability to simultaneously regulate temporal and spatial thermal variability, while being cost-effective and requiring relatively little technical knowledge to assemble, demonstrates the utility of the array for ecological experiments that seek to investigate the impacts of climate warming on thermally variable aquatic ecosystems.

This study evaluates the ecological composition and integrity of the Yangtze River Basin using environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing and network analysis. A comprehensive index of biological integrity (CIBI) was developed based on 63 key metrics selected from 477 candidates, revealing notable seasonal variation in ecological status. By focusing on diversity indices and network parameters, the assessment model avoids the complexity of traditional indicator selection and biological analysis, instead capturing core ecosystem characteristics and reliably predicting the ecological condition of the basin. A structural equation model was used to further refine the model by reducing the number of evaluation indicators, demonstrating that ecological status is affected by physical and nutrient factors, with biodiversity serving as a mediating variable.

However, there has been limited practice in restoring high-altitude lakes, particularly those under protected status. This paper focuses on passed lake restoration with special emphasis on the effects of restoration on lake ecosystems. Restoration efforts in four lakes within Rila National Park, Bulgaria, were carried out in two steps: macrophyte harvesting followed by sediment removal. These were immediately followed by a monitoring programme to evaluate the effects of human activities. The most significant effects on nutrient concentrations (PO4-P, NO3-N, TP and TN) and chlorophyll-a levels were observed one week after the restoration, with these effects diminishing one year later. Changes in bacterial metabolism were characterised by a reduction in metabolic activity, a shift from preferential utilisation of carbohydrates and polymers to an increased use of carboxylic acids and a decrease in functional richness and diversity, followed by partial recovery. Some of the changes observed in lake environments and biotic components were attributed to seasonal shifts, while others were linked to the implementation of human activities. We conclude that the initial steps of lake restoration were effective, with minimal to negligible environmental impact. However, the long-term effectiveness of restoration remains uncertain, so the monitoring programme will continue to address still unresolved questions, particularly to distinguish between seasonal and anthropogenic effects on ecosystems.

This study investigated the variability of total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the Kissimmee River over 37 years (1984-2020) and evaluated the predictive capabilities of machine learning models using remote sensing data to enhance the understanding of phosphorus dynamics in the region. Six machine learning models-Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Light Gradient Boosting (LGB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)-were employed. The models integrated in-situ TP data from 30 water quality monitoring stations with 145 Landsat images, utilizing six spectral bands. The results revealed notable spatial gradients in TP concentrations across the river sections, with downstream areas consistently exhibiting the highest levels (0.15 mg/L), followed by middle (0.12 mg/L) and upstream sections (0.07 mg/L). These variations were closely linked to total suspended sediment distribution differences along the river. Seasonal variations showed elevated TP concentrations during the wet season. Long-term trends indicated both increases and decreases in TP concentrations, reflecting the influence of local land-use changes and hydrological modifications. Over 37 years, long-term trends showed both increases (up to 0.26 mg/L) and decreases (up to 0.37 mg/L), with 18 stations exhibiting rising TP concentrations, primarily in the middle section. Remote sensing data, particularly the near-infrared and shortwave infrared spectral bands, were valuable predictors of TP concentrations. The evaluation of six machine learning models for predicting TP concentrations highlighted the superior performance of gradient-boosting models. XGB achieved the best performance (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.02 mg/L), followed by LGB (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.02 mg/L). RF demonstrated consistent reliability, while ANN performed well during training but underperformed during testing. Comparatively, simpler models such as kNN and DT were less effective. This study highlighted potential of remote sensing and machine learning to predict TP dynamics, supporting data-driven nutrient management strategies. Targeted interventions in downstream areas and during the wet season are key to reducing phosphorus pollution and sustaining the Kissimmee River, Lake Okeechobee, and connected water systems.

Regional assessment of rainfall indices for drought conditions during the monsoon season in Odisha	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Drought in Odisha, India, varies significantly due to its diverse physiographical features, such as orography, river basins, lakes, coastlines, and the Eastern Ghats, which influence rainfall distribution and drought vulnerability. Understanding and interpreting these rainfall patterns is essential for inferring regional rainfall variability for drought conditions, which in turn affects sectors like agriculture, health, energy, and disaster management. This study aims to analyze and quantify regional rainfall variability for drought assessment, focusing on identifying suitable indices for monitoring drought at the block and district levels. Using long-term block-level rainfall data, five key drought indices were evaluated: Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Effective Drought Index (EDI), Deciles Index (DI), and Percentage Departure (PD). Statistical analyses were conducted to assess the performance of these indices in capturing rainfall variability across monthly and daily timescales. The study explored how the indices reflect drought severity in districts with varying geographic conditions. PCI was effective for rainfall distribution, while SPI and EDI were the most reliable for monitoring extreme droughts. In contrast, DI and PD did not align well with observed data. The EDI showed significant drought impacts in the blocks of Jajpur, Khordha, and Koraput, highlighting the need for targeted agricultural interventions. SPI and EDI provide robust tools for assessing drought in Odisha, particularly for disaster management and water resource planning at block, district, and state levels. The study's findings offer critical insights for managing drought in vulnerable regions.

Sherly			Biogenic element concentration and TOC/N ratio analysis in Veli-Akkulam Lake, Kerala: seasonal changes and urbanization impacts	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Rapid urbanization and increased tourism in urban catchments cause a greater input of nutrients and organic matter into lacustrine systems, leading to ecological degradation. The sixth Sustainable Development Goal, which focuses on reducing pollution and improving water quality in lakes and reservoirs, may only be achieved by identifying the sources of pollutants and depositions in the waterbody. Veli-Akkulam is a well-known tourist destination and environmentally significant location in Thiruvananthapuram. It is a small urban lake that borders the Arabian Sea, having an average length of 3.2 km and a depth of 2.4 m. The purpose of this study is to determine the sources of organic pollution in Veli-Akkulam Lake by analysing the spatio-temporal variations in the concentration of biogenic elements and TOC/N of the lake surface sediment samples taken from eight selected stations. The study's findings indicate that silt and clay predominate the eastern portion of the lake, where concentrations of total carbon, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were 6.26%, 5.1%, 0.9%, and 14.5%, respectively. During the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons, the TOC/N varied between 0.95 and 5.04, 0.18 and 4, and 1.01 and 30, respectively, indicating the presence of both autochthonous and allochthonous sources of organic matter. There was a substantial positive correlation between the biogenic elements and the TOC/N ratio. According to the findings, the lake has been affected by eutrophication caused by organic contaminants. Dredging, sediment elution, sewage treatment, and other management techniques must be implemented so as to sustainably manage the lake.

Glaciers in the west Nyainqentanglha Range (WNR) supply meltwater to the densely populated Lhasa River basin (LRB) and Nam Co, the QTP's second-largest endorheic lake. In this study, we used a glacier mass balance model based on the degree-day method (GMB-DDM) to understand the response of glacier changes to climate warming. The spatiotemporal variation in degree-day factors for ice (DDFice; plural form: DDFsice) was assessed to characterize the sensitivity of glacier melt to warming over 44 years in the WNR. Our results demonstrate that the GMB_DDM effectively captured the accelerated mass loss and regional heterogeneity of WNR glaciers from 2000 to 2020, particularly the intensified negative balance after 2014. Moreover, glacier ablation was more sensitive to warming in the WNR during 2000-2020 than 1976-2000, with DDFice increases of 21% +/- 8% in the LRB and 31% +/- 10% in the Nam Co basin (NCB). Increased precipitation during the ablation season and reduced glacier surface albedo can explain the increased sensitivity to warming during 2000-2020. These findings could support sustainable water resource management in the LRB, NCB, and the surrounding areas of the QTP.

A Pilot Study for Water Storage and Carbon Variability in an Irrigation Pond of the Southeastern Plains, USA	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Farm ponds are a common feature of agricultural landscapes for irrigation of crops. Yet small water bodies have been ignored as reservoirs and carbon balance features despite their ubiquity in the global landscape. These ponds contain surface water from precipitation and runoff, but in South Georgia, USA, groundwater supplementation is required to maintain a supply for irrigation. Key characteristics of these ponds, such as capacity and dynamics describing fluxes in quantity and quality, are not well known. In this area, irrigation ponds supplemented by groundwater have water quality issues that affect producers. In a pilot study to address this knowledge gap, storage dynamics and water quality, that is, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were characterized from measurements of a regionally typical irrigation pond in 2022. Field surveys of pond depth and terrain were fused to create a topobathymetric elevation model of the pond and its environs. The pond has a volume of 5.06 +/- 0.29 ha-m that was used for irrigation during the growing season and was mostly replaced with groundwater. Concentrations of DOC ranged from 1.77 to 19.9 mg/L. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) indices reveal a shift from terrestrial-derived DOM earlier in the year to more microbial-derived DOM later. Together this integrated analysis of an irrigation pond in South Georgia analyzes water inflows and outflows, quantifies DOC, characterizes DOM, and models pond storage volumes.					; Albright, Andrea/ONJ-2726-2025; Coffin, Alisa/AAD-4539-2019	Albright, Andrea/0000-0003-2670-1625; 													1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2025	61	3							e70026	10.1111/1752-1688.70026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.70026													WOS:001517445800006

Nevertheless, research on the impacts of water quality parameters on avian diversity and abundance within the Lake Tana biosphere reserve remains limited. The present study investigated spatial and temporal relationships of water physicochemical parameters at different sites based on anthropogenic disturbance, namely, urban, cultivar, grazing, and island sites with bird diversity, abundance, and distribution, using the point count method. A total of 209 bird species from 60 families and 21 orders, including 47 migrants, nine threatened species, and five endemic species, were recorded. Our findings show that avifaunal diversity and abundance are lower in disturbed urban and cultivated habitats that exhibit elevated levels of suspended solids (SS) and turbidity, along with the lowest recorded levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH, indicating that the Lake Tana biosphere reserve is in poor health. Species richness and abundance exhibited a positive correlation with both pH levels and DO. The findings showed that anthropogenic factors adversely affected the physicochemical parameters at the selected sampling sites to a varying degree. Across sampling sites, the mean spatial and seasonal pH measurements remained within the acceptable range, tending towards alkalinity, which is conducive to the majority of aquatic biota. The study highlights the necessity for effective management strategies focused on enhancing water quality and reducing the effects of anthropogenic disturbances to secure the long-term sustainability of the Lake Tana ecosystem and its avian biodiversity. Moreover, the presence of threatened, endemic, and migratory species, such as Necrosyrtes monachus, Gyps africanus, Aquila rapax, Clanga clanga, Balearica pavonina, Oxyura maccoa, Bostrychia carunculata, and Agapornis taranta emphasizes the importance of avifaunal conservation in Lake Tana and its surrounding habitats.

However, their populations are threatened by various stressors, like the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and associated viral pathogens. In this study, we aimed to characterise and compare the viral communities (viromes) in V. destructor-resistant and susceptible colonies using high-throughput sequencing. Our findings revealed differences in virome composition associated with the season and not with the resistance or susceptibility to V. destructor. Furthermore, we detected Apis mellifera filamentous virus (AmFV) and Lake Sinai virus (LSV) for the first time in Uruguay, and obtained the complete or partial genomes of both viruses, along with those of other previously described viruses, such as Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Deformed wing virus (DWV), and Sacbrood virus (SBV). This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the virome dynamics in honey bees. It highlights the importance of this type of study for the early detection of new viral pathogens, which could help to understand the tripartite network involving V. destructor, honey bees, and viruses.

Epipelic diatom samples were collected from five different stations each season (February, May, August, and November) in 2019. A total number of eighty-seven taxa belonging to thirty-seven genera were identified, six of which were centric and eighty-one were pennate; five of the epipelic species were new record diatoms for the B & uuml;y & uuml;k & ccedil;ekmece Reservoir. The highest number of epipelic diatom species were encountered in February while the lowest was in November. Considering the frustule counts, it was observed that the species that increased their relative abundance changed in each sampling period. Consequently, it was observed that Gomphonella olivacea was the most abundant in February, Navicula reichardtiana in May, Achnanthidium sp. in August, and Cocconeis placentula in November. Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index showed that the highest diversity of diatom species was determined in February (station 4), and the lowest was observed in August (station 3). According to the results of redundancy analysis, it was observed that silicate-Si, conductivity, and temperature were the most efficient variables in the distribution of the epipelic diatom species.

This study evaluates the spatial and seasonal water quality of four major urban lakes in Udaipur-Fateh Sagar, Swaroop Sagar, Pichola, and Goverdhan Sagar-using an integrated approach that combines multiple water pollution indices (WQI, CPI, OPI, and EI) and irrigation suitability indices (SAR, KR, Na%, PI, TH, MH, RSC, and RSBC). An interlake comparative analysis was employed to examine spatial-temporal variations, while land use/land cover (LULC) mapping and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to identify dominant pollution sources. Results reveal significant spatial-temporal variation, with Goverdhan Sagar showing the highest pollution levels (WQI > 300, CPI > 1, OPI > 2.5, and EI > 0.01) due to sewage and industrial discharges, while Fateh Sagar had comparatively better water quality. Although irrigation suitability remained largely acceptable, elevated SAR and RSC levels pose long-term risks to soil health. PCA highlighted organic pollution, nutrient enrichment, and industrial effluents as key contributors to degradation. The study presents a replicable multi-index geospatial framework to support sustainable urban lake management and inform targeted pollution control strategies.

Biotic resistance across a nutrient gradient in experimental wetland mesocosms	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Anthropogenic degradation of wetlands often leads to regional biotic homogenization and reduced plant diversity. This reduction is often attributed to the proliferation and dominance of a few generalist, often non-native, species. Biotic resistance from natives can sometimes impede the growth and spread of colonizers, but its dependence on environmental conditions is poorly understood. Based on field and modeling studies, we tested the predictions that (1) biotic resistance declines at higher nitrogen loading and (2) size influences colonization success. In a five-growing season mesocosm experiment, we grew three cattail taxa: Typha latifolia (native, large), Typha angustifolia (non-native, invasive, smallest), and Typha x glauca (hybrid, most invasive, large) as potential colonizers in the presence or absence of pre-established resident vegetation. At two sites differing in climate and growing season length, biotic resistance treatments were crossed with 12 nitrogen levels (inflows 0-45 g N m-2 year-1). Each treatment combination was replicated twice, totaling 48 mesocosms per site. Without residents, colonizers (as total biomass of all three cattail taxa) persisted and expanded clonally across all nitrogen levels. However, their expansion was generally lower when colonizing a pre-established resident community compare to bare ground. The magnitude of biotic resistance, measured as the effect of residents on colonizers' biomass, and its interaction with nitrogen differed between sites. As predicted, biotic resistance decreased with high nitrogen at the northern site, but at the southern site, residents nearly eliminated colonizers. As anticipated, smaller T. angustifolia was a poorer colonizer than the other taxa, while T. x glauca was the strongest colonizer, especially under high nitrogen conditions where biotic resistance was minimal. Our findings partially support the hypothesis that biotic resistance declines with nitrogen loading, indicating that additional research on the factors influencing the magnitude of biotic resistance is needed. Importantly, when combined with our finding that Typha can persist at all nutrient levels when natives are absent, this information could help identify wetlands particularly vulnerable to invasion, especially in environments experiencing concurrent nutrient enrichment and disturbances that expose bare ground.

The Giant South American River Turtle, Podocnemis expansa, is recognized for its social interactions across all sexes and age/size groups. Its movement patterns, especially those of subadults, are poorly understood. Movement is a crucial factor for the effective conservation and management of wildlife. From October 2010 to September 2011, using VHF radio-tracking methods, we studied the movements of eight subadult females in the Trombetas River Biological Reserve (REBIO do Rio Trombetas) in Par & aacute; State, Brazil. We observed subadult females utilizing lake-channel systems near the Trombetas River with their movement rates positively influenced by their size and negatively by the water level of the river. Individuals remained in the flooded forest (igap & oacute;) during flooding, likely feeding on fruits and seeds. During the nesting season, we observed interactions between adult and subadult females near the nesting sandbanks. The proximity of subadult and adult Giant South American River Turtles suggests that social interactions, such as learning reproductive and nesting behaviors, could be vital for the movement of subadult females, going beyond simple resource availability.

Effects of Total Suspended Solids on Photomineralization of Dissolved Organic Matter in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Northern deltas receive chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from their watersheds, which can be oxidized to carbon dioxide upon absorption of sunlight (i.e., photomineralized). These deltas also receive total suspended solids (TSS), which may shade sunlight absorption by CDOM, thus limiting photomineralization. To quantify this interaction for the first time, we measured photomineralization rates at 11 sites in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada. We sampled waters during a July 2022 field campaign for TSS concentration, CDOM concentration (a(CDOM,lambda)), total downwelling sunlight attenuation coefficients (K-d,K-tot,K-lambda), and light attenuation coefficients due to CDOM (K-d,K-CDOM,K-lambda). TSS ranged from <1 to 112 mg/L with an average of 19 +/- 34 mg/L (mean +/- one standard deviation), an order of magnitude lower than TSS reported in rivers entering the PAD earlier in the open water season. a(CDOM,lambda )at 305 nm (a(CDOM,305)) ranged from 23.3 to 65.2 m(-1), Kd,CDOM,305 ranged from 26.3 to 74.1 m(-1), and Kd,tot,305 ranged from 19.0 to 63.7 m(-1). The ratio of sunlight absorbed by CDOM relative to total sunlight attenuation (K-d,K-CDOM,K-lambda/K-d,K-tot,K-lambda) was inversely correlated with TSS concentration across all wavelengths measured (305-412 nm). TSS thus limited photomineralization rates by shading CDOM from ultraviolet A and visible wavelengths of sunlight, reducing photomineralization rates by up to 56% compared to rates in the absence of TSS or other non-CDOM particles that attenuate sunlight. Results suggest that shifts in delta hydrology that affect TSS concentration likely influence photomineralization rates within TSS-rich northern deltas.					; Cory, Rose/C-4198-2016	LaFramboise, Nathan/0009-0002-5853-1974; Cory, Rose/0000-0001-9867-7084; Dolan, Wayana/0000-0001-8405-4302; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN	2025	130	6							e2024JG008620	10.1029/2024JG008620	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008620													WOS:001513623400001

To address this challenge, we strategically selected Hulun Lake, the largest freshwater lake in northern China, as the study site. A total of 245 samples of precipitation, river water, groundwater and lake water were collected during the wet season. We analysed their hydrogen and oxygen isotopic characteristics and their relationships to elucidate the recharge mechanisms between different water bodies via isotope conservation and endmember element mixing models. The key findings were as follows. (1) In terms of the changes in precipitation isotopes, the precipitation isotopes gradually depleted with time, whereas the isotopes of lake water, groundwater and river water were relatively stable. (2) On this basis, the local meteoric water line (LMWL) of the lake basin during the wet season was established as delta D = 7.11 x delta O-18 - 5.36 (R-2 = 0.89), and the slope and intercept were slightly lower than those at the global and national levels. Specifically, the slopes and intercepts of the lake water line, groundwater line and river water line were similar but distinct from those of the local meteoric water line. (3) In terms of recharge processes and interactions, precipitation had a recharge effect on the other three water bodies, and different water bodies had strong interactions, regardless of their intermediary mutual recharge processes. Collectively, our results suggested that river water was the main recharge source of the lake, with a recharge rate of 42.9%, followed by groundwater (9.3%) and precipitation (1.5%). Our findings revealed the distinct roles of rivers and precipitation in recharging lakes in arid lake basins during the wet season. Therefore, this research is highly relevant for the management of local water resources and provides a reference for hydrological research in similar regions worldwide.

J	Feldman, EV; Kettenring, KM				Feldman, Elana V.; Kettenring, Karin M.			Bet Hedging to Aid Seed-Based Wetland Restoration Under Hydrologic Extremes	WETLANDS												Reestablishing native plant communities following invasive species management is a common restoration goal for wetland managers. Although passive recolonization is occasionally sufficient, often, active revegetation through seeding is required. However, the outcomes of seeding likely differ by site (due to varying environmental conditions) and the composition of the seed mix. We evaluated the effects of both passive recolonization and seeding treatments (varying density and diversity of natives) on wetland plant community cover and composition at two sites in the Great Salt Lake Watershed, USA, over two years. We found that passive recolonization was insufficient to increase native plant cover at one location and limit invasive species' cover at either location. Furthermore, different emergent wetland restoration sites, despite geographic proximity, had different plant community outcomes, likely due to distinct site environmental conditions. We also found that the effects of the seeding treatments appeared to be overwhelmed by water depth due to two extreme weather events (severe drought in year 1 and prolonged flooding in year 2). However, these events provided an opportunity to observe the recovery potential of the different functional groups and identify three species of restoration interest (Bolboschoenus maritimus, Schoenoplectus acutus, and Distichlis spicata) that were able to survive the extreme conditions during both growing seasons at one site. These findings underscore the importance of not relying on passive recolonization and instead using bet-hedging strategies (e.g., seeding diverse mixes with species with a range of hydrologic tolerances) to overcome hydrologic extremes, conditions likely to become more common with climate change and ever-increasing upstream water diversions.

Ephemeroptera (mayfly) grazers rely on periphyton as their primary source of essential dietary nutrients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and other lipids. Along stream continua, lakes may interrupt the flow of dietary nutrients with as yet unknown effects on the lipid and PUFA composition of periphyton and Ephemeroptera located downstream of lakes. In this field study, we investigated four subalpine streams, one feeding and one draining Lake Lunz (Austria), one unaffected by the lake, and one after the confluence of the last two streams, from May-August 2022 to assess temporal and spatial variations in the lipid and fatty acid (FA) composition of different grazing Ephemeroptera taxa of the family Heptageniidae and periphyton as their diet source. Grazing Ephemeroptera were significantly enriched in total lipids and FA compared to periphyton and contained 15 times more eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3; EPA). Evidence from compound-specific stable isotopes of PUFA suggested that these Ephemeroptera mainly accumulated PUFA from periphyton and only converted a small proportion of dietary precursors to EPA in lower-order streams. Even though the lake had a discernible impact on the relative FA composition of downstream periphyton, the amount of dietary lipids available for consumers remained similar across all study streams over time. Seasonal variations in Ephemeroptera FA profiles were evident, with the peak lipid and FA contents observed in June potentially linked to imminent emergence. Rhithrogena spp. contained significantly higher lipid and PUFA contents than the other genera, suggesting a more efficient retention of dietary lipids. These findings highlight the importance of considering site-specific, temporal, and taxonomic factors when evaluating FA composition patterns within stream ecosystems and the dietary quality of benthic invertebrates for higher-order consumers.

Bank filtration is favourable, since it can increase the amount of water that can be sustainably abstracted from an aquifer, and it may balance changes in the groundwater level. On the other hand, bank filtration may lower groundwater quality if the quality of infiltrating surface water is not sufficient. To provide up-to-date information for risk management and preparedness plans that are applicable to groundwater intake plants utilising bank filtration, several tools and methods were tested. A feasible test site was selected for piloting to better understand the processes that take place during bank filtration. Several traditional research methods were used to map the geological structure of the test aquifer. In addition, methods to assess seasonal changes in groundwater recharge patterns and groundwater quantity, as well as surface water and groundwater quality, were tested and piloted. The studies enabled the identification of infiltration zones from the lake to the aquifer, as well as the main groundwater flow paths within the aquifer. The conducted studies also provided practical experience on how to best monitor any future changes in natural surface water-groundwater interaction, as well as in induced bank filtration, expected due to climate change or increasing water demand.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				JUN	2025	11	3							51	10.1007/s40899-025-01225-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-025-01225-4													WOS:001464678300001
J	Lambret, P; Deleva, S; Uzunov, S; Popov, D				Lambret, Philippe; Deleva, Stanimira; Uzunov, Spas; Popov, Dimitar			Status of Lestes macrostigma in Bulgaria, with annotations on its ecology (Odonata: Lestidae)	ODONATOLOGICA												Measuring population trends of freshwater insects helps to assess their conservation status and to design management protocols for wetlands. Lestes macrostigma is restricted to temporary brackish waters, a limited and fragmented habitat. Throughout its range this species is threatened at different levels, and, in Bulgaria, it has been assessed as "Critically Endangered". In the past, along the Black Sea coast, it was known to be abundant and reproducing at two sites: Shablenska Tuzla Lake and Poda Protected Area. At a third site, Pomorie Lake, only a few individuals were recorded without clear evidence of reproduction. We aimed at updating its distribution along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast and determining the conservation status of its populations by conducting surveys from 2021 to 2024 at 53 localities, mainly within coastal lagoons and estuaries. We recorded all Odonata species along with their various life stages and reproductive behaviour. Other resident species recorded in association with L. macrostigma were Lestes barbarus, L. dryas, Ischnura elegans, Aeshna affinis, Sympetrum fonscolombii, S. meridionale, and S. striolatum. We counted L. macrostigma adults along walks and extrapolated abundance over the entire sites and season. Lestes macrostigma population size reached hundreds of thousands of adults at Shablenska tuzla and Pomorie Lake. At Nanevska tuzla and Atanasovsko Lake, two new sites for the species, thousands of adults were present. However, we found that L. macrostigma had disappeared from at least a part of Poda Protected Area, most likely because of a change in water management practices. As the timing of the flooding period is a key feature of the species' habitat, we found that its presence in the temperate Bulgarian estuaries was unlikely. As conservation management plans are still lacking for Shablenska tuzla and Pomorie Lake, the future of the two largest L. macrostigma populations of Bulgaria of international importance seems tenuous and uncertain. Therefore, key actions for the conservation of L. macrostigma are the proper management of its existing reproductive sites and restoring or recreating temporary wetlands.

Seasonal microbiological and hydrochemical studies of 10 floodplain lakes in the & Lstrok;yna River floodplain, characterised by varying hydrological connectivity, revealed that methanotrophic bacteria (MOB) and mGen significantly influenced CH4 and CO2 emissions. The microbial structure, expressed as the MOB/mGen ratio, was associated with a gradient of CH4 flux rates specific to each oxbow type. Average CH4 fluxes from the lakes were 21, 225 and 507 mg m-2 day-1 for lotic, semi-lotic and lentic systems, respectively, while corresponding CO2 fluxes were 0.8, 0.7 and 1.0 g CO2 m-2 day-1, respectively. Statistically significant differences in CH4 and CO2 fluxes were observed between lentic and lotic water bodies. The partial least squares model indicated that water temperature significantly stimulated MOB and mGen abundances. Moreover, chlorophyll-a, turbidity and chemical oxygen demand positively correlated with the presence of these microbial groups. Methanotrophs were negatively affected by NH4-N, while methanogens were affected by NO3-N. These findings highlight the complex biotic and abiotic interactions driving greenhouse gas emissions in floodplain ecosystems and suggest targeted management strategies to mitigate their climate impacts.					; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019	Burandt, Pawel/0000-0001-6514-4361; GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUN	2025	27	6							e70127	10.1111/1462-2920.70127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.70127								40545729					WOS:001512585500001

Inland waters fix inorganic carbon to form autochthonous organic carbon (Auto-OC) and accept laterally transferred terrestrial OC. Calculating the carbon sink flux of inland water requires a quantitative estimation of the proportion of the aforementioned processes. In the current study, n-alkanes are used as biomarkers and the dual carbon isotope method (Bayesian mixing model) is applied to estimate the proportions of Auto-OC in the sediment of a simulation site comprising five shallow submerged macrophyte-dominated subsystems. The study results showed that a high proportion of Auto-OC was present in all sediment, regardless of the season or subsystem. However, the proportions were higher in the warm-humid season than in the cold-dry season. Results from a correlation analysis showed that temperature-controlled seasonal variations in the photosynthetic strength of aquatic organisms are the most likely cause of this difference. The average deposition rates of total organic carbon and Auto-OC were high (66.7 and 58.2 g C/m2/yr, respectively). Throughout the year, the weighted average percentage of Auto-OC ranged from 76% to 90%, with a mean value of 86% in the five aquatic subsystems. Establishing and maintaining submerged macrophytedominated systems have a potential of decreasing carbon dioxide (CO2) evasion and sequestrating more carbon (C) in headwaters. Working for clear submerged macrophyte-dominated lakes is beneficial for increasing carbon sinks. (c) 2024 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation.

Employing GIS spatial analysis, non-parametric tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and redundancy analysis (RDA), the research examines how land use types within different buffer zone scales affect water quality. The findings indicate: (1) The dominant land use types in the study area are cultivated land, construction land, and water areas. (2) Overall, water quality is better in the dry season than in the rainy season, with higher concentrations of CODMn and TP occurring in the rainy season, and higher concentrations of DO, NH3-N, and TN in the dry season. (3) Cultivated land and construction land are positively correlated with all water quality indices, whereas forest lands and water areas generally exhibit a negative correlation. The correlation between grasslands and water quality indices alternates with changes in spatial scale.

However, detailed data from numerous wetlands located in the Huaihe River Basin, especially those situated in Huaibei Plain, are still lacking. From March 2022 to February 2023, 12 monthly surveys were conducted on 10 protected areas in the Huaibei Plain. Multivariate analysis, in conjunction with Redundancy Analysis, Variation Partitioning, Mantel Tests, and Linear Regression, was employed to assess the impact of vegetation factors, landscape elements, and human disturbance on the multidimensional diversity of waterbirds. A total of 50,011 waterbirds representing 71 species were recorded. The size of water surface and the richness of patch types significantly influenced the seasonal distribution of waterbirds (p < 0.05). The diversity of bird communities was closely associated with the shape index of water, as well as the proportion of ponds and farmland around wetlands. With an increase in vegetation coverage, there was a significant rise in species richness (p < 0.05). Human disturbances emerged as a primary negative factor, adversely impacting species diversity, species richness, and phylogenetic diversity of waterbirds (p < 0.05). Given the current scenario, a comprehensive management approach, considering both landscape and vegetation characteristics, is crucial for conserving the rich bird diversity in the wetlands of the Huaibei Plain. These findings provide key baseline data regarding the waterbird communities and may help to design effective protection and management plans.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2025	45	5							65	10.1007/s13157-025-01943-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-025-01943-7													WOS:001506233900001
J	Luo, TT; Zhang, YH				Luo, Tingting; Zhang, Yehui			Machine learning classification and driver analysis of diel variability in dissolved oxygen in Taihu Lake	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Dissolved oxygen (DO) plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems, yet its diel variations are influenced by complex environmental interactions. This study analyzed high-frequency DO data from Sanshandao Island in Taihu Lake (2020-2022) to classify diel DO variation patterns and identify key drivers. Using K-means clustering, we identified three distinct types: Type I (warm, humid, rainy, moderate DO fluctuations, late DO peaks, influenced by photosynthesis and precipitation), Type II (warm, dry, high radiation, largest diel DO amplitude, early peaks, photosynthesis-dominated), and Type III (cold-season conditions, high DO levels, minimal diel fluctuations, temperature-driven). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and precipitation were major regulators of diel DO dynamics. PAR strongly influenced DO variations in Type II, while precipitation played a key role in distinguishing Type I from Type II by affecting vertical mixing. To enhance interpretability and predictive accuracy, XGBoost regression models were trained separately for each type, with SHAP analysis quantifying the contributions of individual drivers. The classification-based modeling approach improved performance significantly (R2 increased from 0.73 to > 0.8 in Type I and III). This study presents an integrated framework combining unsupervised clustering and interpretable machine learning to uncover the mechanisms of diel DO variation. The results underscore the need to account for DO pattern heterogeneity in prediction and management and offer new tools for developing targeted water quality strategies in eutrophic lake systems.

Using morphological and geochemical data from eight paleosols interbedded in the aeolian units of a perched dune related to the ephemeral, shallow Laguna Arturo lake (53 degrees 43 ' S, 68 degrees 18 ' W), we assessed Holocene soil formation. The morphological characteristics and CIA index of the paleosols indicate poor to moderate weathering, with very limited hydrolysis and leaching mostly due to the subhumid climatic regime of the Fuegian steppe. Despite this, pedogenesis led to the formation of discrete paleosols after the Late Glacial. Oxidation is a conspicuous process in the Lateglacial-Early Holocene and early Middle Holocene paleosols of the succession. The poor pedological structure of paleosols from the late Middle Holocene, along with the aeolian deposits rate of sedimentation, records more likely arid conditions in southern Patagonia, a pattern consistent with other multi-proxy records in the region. The Late Holocene paleosols record slightly higher CIA indices and characteristics compatible with a higher moisture in the environment compared to the Middle Holocene. The studied dune-paleosol succession documents relatively short soil formation intervals, possibly linked to increased humidity in the Fuegian steppe due to short-term climate variability since around 12,800 cal yrs.

Toward Improved Short-Term Forecasting for Lake Victoria Basin. Part II: Preconvective Environment Analysis with ERA5	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in Africa, with around 30 million people living on its coastline, and it serves as one of the largest natural resources for East African communities due to its prosperous fishing industry. However, around 1000 fishermen die annually on the lake due to severe weather-related accidents. Radar-based research from the "High Impact Weather Lake System" (HIGHWAY) project in 2019 confirmed the marked diurnal cycle on Lake Victoria, studied over decades, where organized, intense convective systems pose a major risk to the fishermen operating overnight. Building upon the results from Part I of this study, we investigate the preconvective environment over the lake for the modes that have been previously identified with a radar-based classification for the two wet seasons in 2019. ERA5 reanalysis data show that in 2019, instability and steeper low-level lapse rates were higher during season I [March-May (MAM)], allowing unorganized storms overnight to have stronger downdrafts, increasing the potential for strong and damaging winds over the lake. Second, the multicell linear mode in season II [October-December (OND)] and at nighttime presents significantly low RH700-500hPa, which might indicate potential strong winds at the surface (evaporative cooling). Third, bulk shear was higher in season I 2019 for almost all modes, with some modes indicating the capacity to organize into multicell systems and even some to have rotating updrafts. Finally, some modes in season I, at nighttime and early morning, present high storm-relative helicity values in midlevels, which, combined with high bulk shear, may lead to embedded rotations in dynamically complex systems.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				JUN	2025	153	6					983	999		10.1175/MWR-D-24-0074.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-24-0074.1													WOS:001500611200001

Despite its ecosystem service, environmental flows are ignored by water users in the catchment. Study focus: Studies on the impacts of domestic and irrigation water abstractions on environmental flows are limited. This study evaluated these impacts using citizen science data-based integrated HEC-HMS and WEAP modeling. The assessment included a spatio-temporal analysis of domestic water demand and water supply data, irrigation water requirement, and environmental flow requirements. The WEAP model was calibrated using citizen science data, and unmet demands were evaluated. Finally, unmet environmental flows were evaluated for three scenarios of historical rainfall in normal, dry, and wet years. New hydrological insights for the region: This study demonstrated citizen science data effectiveness in integrating HEC-HMS and WEAP models to evaluate the unmet demand and water use impacts on environmental flow. Our finding showed a large unmet water demand of 25.60 Mm3 in the dry season, although the catchment's annual surface water potential exceeds the demands. Environmental flow requirements, estimated at 31 % of the mean annual flow, were unmet by 24 %55.2 % during dry seasons in the normal, dry, and wet years with critical deficits in the dry years. Meeting environmental flow requires reallocation of water through a catchment-wide water management that considers conflict-sensitive approaches.																				2214-5818				JUN	2025	59								102435	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102435													WOS:001487262200001

Standard analytical procedures were used to measure water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen (DO), and major ions. The lake exhibited dominant ionic composition in the order of Ca-2(+) > Na+ > K+ > Mg-2(+) and HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3-, characterizing it as a Ca-HCO3 water type. In addition, geochemical analyses, supported by the Piper plot and Gibbs diagram, identified rock weathering particularly carbonate dissolution as the primary mechanism governing the hydrochemistry. Elevated ratios of (Ca-2(+) + Mg-2(+))/TZ(+), (Ca-2(+) + Mg-2(+))/(Na+ + K+), Ca-2(+)/Na+, and HCO3-/Na+ further corroborate the dominance of carbonate weathering processes. Similarly, regarding seasonality, cluster analysis delineated two distinct groups of sampling points, highlighting monsoon-driven seasonality on water quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) explains 87.71% of the total variance, with PC1 primarily reflecting natural geogenic contributions, while PC2 and PC3 capture anthropogenic influences. Furthermore, a comparative analysis between monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons reveals improved water quality during the monsoon period based on water quality indices. This study highlights the effectiveness of geochemical analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, and the water quality index in assessing water quality, providing valuable insights into the interplay of natural processes, human activities, and seasonal variations in shaping the water chemistry of Phewa Lake. It also offers valuable implications for the sustainable management of freshwater resources in Ramsar-listed Himalayan lakes in the context of climate change and escalating anthropogenic influences particularly the tourism dynamics and its role in shaping water quality.

A Novel Algorithm for Ice-Water Discrimination in Large Lakes Using ICESat-2 Altimetry and Data Driven Machine Learning	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE												Large freshwater lakes are critical for human life, ecosystem functioning, and the global carbon cycle. However, consistent high-resolution methods to characterize ice over large lakes remain limited. Here we develop an algorithm to progress ice observations over inland bodies of water by improving surface classifications using data derived from ICESat-2, Landsat 8/9 and other operational products. This algorithm implements a hierarchical approach composed of remote sensing products and data driven machine learning. In this study we show that although the current classification method used in ICESat-2 Inland Surface Water Height (ATL13) is prone to overgeneralization and misclassification, our proposed algorithm, which integrates novel classification methods and data-driven machine learning, enhances surface classification accuracy. We tested this algorithm on a wide breadth of data, spanning four ice seasons in the Laurentian Great Lakes. In our algorithm, we developed two prediction methods that outperformed the current classification method in place for ATL13 by 26.46% and 20.37% and is scalable to other inland surface waters because of the global coverage of the necessary parameters for surface classification. Improved surface classification allows for inland surface bodies of water to be observed with greater detail, particularly using ICESat-2 data, and enables the production of improved data sets of ice concentration and thickness. Improved ice information on Earth's largest lakes will have cascading effects on not only public safety and operational efficiency, but also the monitoring of anthropogenic changes in these bodies of water.					; Kurtz, Nathan/N-8745-2014	Peter, Isabella/0009-0002-4907-5778; 														2333-5084				JUN	2025	12	6							e2024EA004155	10.1029/2024EA004155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024EA004155													WOS:001503437100001

Study focus: In arid and semi-arid regions, limited research has addressed how hydrological processes affect irrigation demand, especially under varying evaporation and recharge conditions. This research gap constrains water resources utilization and ecosystem protection. By combining the stable isotope method with water resources assessment, this study analyzed the hydrologic characteristics and proposed a coordinated surface-groundwater irrigation strategy based on spatiotemporal dynamics of evaporation and recharge. New hydrological insights: In most areas of the Yuxi River basin, groundwater is the main source of the river, accounting for 89.24 % and 88.18 % of river recharge during dry and wet periods, respectively. Except for June, river water remains a reliable source for agricultural irrigation during the irrigation season. Reservoirs and lakes significantly influence local evaporation and surface-groundwater interactions, with distinct spatio-temporal differences in the upstream and midstream sections. Furthermore, due to the combined influence of groundwater, tributaries, evaporation, and open water bodies, there is river water recharging groundwater in areas around river confluences, lakes, and res-ervoirs, with recharge percentages reaching 90.98 % and 81.63 % during dry and wet periods, respectively. Thus, groundwater should be the preferred irrigation source in these areas during May, July, and August. This isotope-based method offers scientific guidance for sustainable irrigation management in arid and semi-arid regions.																				2214-5818				JUN	2025	59								102412	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102412													WOS:001483105000001

Study focus: The study aimed to develop a spatially complete and temporally continuous lake surface water temperature (LSWT) dataset by fusing satellite remote sensing data with reanalysis products. Five satellite-derived LSWT products, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), were evaluated against in-situ measurements. The reanalysis product ERA5-Land, offering hourly LSWT at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees, was fused with the MODIS LSWT product using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Model (ESTARFM). ESTARFM combines high spatial but low temporal resolution data with products of low spatial but high temporal resolution. New hydrological insights for the region: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of data fusion in generating accurate and continuous LSWT datasets for large lakes. The fused LSWT product achieved a mean absolute error of 1.53 degrees C and R2 of 0.86, showing comparable accuracy to ERA5-Land data. While a bias-correction approach was tested, results indicated that seasonal adjustments may be more effective. The fused dataset captured spatial and temporal variations in LSWT, aligning well with in-situ measurements and existing datasets. This approach enables improved LSWT monitoring and provides a valuable tool for studying ecological changes in lakes driven by climate change. The method can be applied to other large lakes with suitable datasets, supporting regional and global hydrological studies.

This study investigated the occurrence, seasonal distribution, and ecological risk assessment of 12 OPE congeners in surface water from the northwestern Taihu Lake Basin. Results revealed that all target OPE congeners were detected, with median concentrations of LOPE being 182.6 ng/L, 598.6 ng/L, and 72.3 ng/L in May, September, and January, respectively. The most abundant OPEs found were triethyl phosphate (TEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), accounting for median 32.84 %, 25.83 % and 16.04 %, respectively. Significant seasonal variations were observed in pollution levels for most OPEs, showing that surface runoff rainwater may be the dominant driving factor. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis with multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) indicated that elevated levels of OPEs sourced from discharge outlets along the river, such as agricultural non-point source runoff and industrial initial rainwater, etc. For ecological risk, 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) and TCEP were concluded as the primary contributors, with respective median risk quotients (RQs) of 0.014 in May and 0.139 for EHDPP in September, along with TCEP at 0.010 in January. Additionally, the ToxPi score showed that the top five priority OPEs were identified as triphenyl phosphate (TPP) (0.76), TCrP (0.72), TCEP (0.71), triphenylphosphine oxide (TPhP) (0.66), and tris(2butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) (0.58). These findings provide novel insights into the occurrence of OPEs and establish a scientific foundation for improved management of high-risk OPEs in aquatic ecosystems.

Two QTP lakes, Ngoring (NL) and BLH-A (BL), have similar latitudes, altitudes and climatic conditions. However, observed water temperature when freezing is lower in NL (about 0.5 degrees C) and higher in BL (about 4 degrees C). According to the novel lake thermal classification method proposed by Yang et al. (2021, ) (Yang's method), NL and BL should be classified as cryomictic and cryostratified, respectively. However, the results calculated using both the original and improved Yang's method classified both lakes as cryomictic. Clearly, Yang's method was applicable to NL but not suitable for BL. This was probably because the method only considered lake area, depth, and wind speed, but neglected energy dissipation caused by bottom friction. Additionally, the LAKE model was employed to investigate the bottom friction effect. Results indicated that the extent of bottom friction effect on the two lakes was different and jointly influenced by small surface area and shallow depth.					wang, mengxiao/GYD-6030-2022														0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2025	61	6							e2024WR039376	10.1029/2024WR039376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024WR039376													WOS:001507255000001
J	Wang, Q; Wang, HL				Wang, Qi; Wang, Hailong			Estimating river water level using satellite altimetry and water surface temperature data in a regulated subtropical river	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Dongjiang River in east Guangdong, China Study focus: River water level (RWL) is an important parameter for evaluating hydrologic regimes. RWL estimation based on remote sensing techniques has drawn great attention to the hydrologic community even with relatively low temporal resolution but acceptable accuracy. The techniques adapt well in wide rivers with little disturbance, while they have not been fully tested in heavily regulated rivers. In this study, we tested two methods for RWL estimation: the altimetry-based and the temperature-based methods. New hydrological insights: The Jason data with a similar to 10-day revisit period were insightful for RWL simulations, and the temperature-based model reproduced well the daily RWL observations. Noticeably, both methods simulated low flows better than high flows. Underestimation of high flows can be a result of asynchrony between RWL and satellite scanning due to the low temporal resolutions. Temperature retrieved for narrow rivers may contain mixed information of water and non-water surfaces, weakening the water level-temperature relationship. Intentional discharge from the upstream reservoir for downstream ecological conservation during dry seasons could also challenge both methods for capturing the induced high flows. This study provides two means of estimating RWL continuously using readily available satellite products for small regulated subtropical rivers, which can be practically useful in any rivers with carefully selected processing algorithms.																				2214-5818				JUN	2025	59								102376	10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2025.102376													WOS:001471384800001

This study aims to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of atmospheric methane concentrations between 2019 and 2025, focusing on comparisons between regions characterized by high and low emission intensities. Level-3 XCH4 data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite were used, which were aggregated into seasonal and annual composites. High-emission regions, such as the Mekong Delta, Nile Delta, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Central Thailand, Lake Victoria Basin, and Eastern Arkansas, were contrasted with low-emission areas including Patagonia, the Mongolian Steppe, Northern Scandinavia, the Australian Outback, the Sahara Desert, and the Canadian Shield. The results show that high-emission regions exhibit substantially higher seasonal amplitude in XCH4 concentrations, with an average seasonal variation of approximately 30.00 ppb, compared to 17.39 ppb in low-emission regions. Methane concentrations generally peaked at the end of the year (Q4) and reached their lowest levels during the first half of the year (Q1 or Q2), particularly in agriculturally dominated regions. Principal component and cluster analyses further confirmed a strong spatial differentiation between high- and low-emission regions based on both temporal trends and seasonal behavior. These findings demonstrate the potential of satellite remote sensing to monitor regional methane dynamics and highlight the need for targeted mitigation strategies in major agricultural and wetland zones.					; Wójcik-Gront, Elżbieta/AAC-9034-2021	Gozdowski, Dariusz/0000-0002-7365-7607; Wnuk, Agnieszka/0000-0002-4105-9717; 														2073-4433				JUN 1	2025	16	6							670	10.3390/atmos16060670	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16060670													WOS:001515222000001

A total of 102 water samples were collected from 17 sampling sites during dry and wet seasons and digested according to APHA standard protocol. Elements were analyzed using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer. Multivariate statistical methods and metal indices were used for the analysis of the PTEs to assess the level of pollution load and sources of the pollutants. The results indicated high concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, nickel, cadmium, boron, and chromium during the dry season. Conversely, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, and Hg increased during the wet season. Cadmium, lead, and mercury were higher at the river banks of Gelda, Megech, Rib, and Gumera. The average concentrations of all PTEs varied between 20.06 +/- 9.6 and 0.02 +/- 0.01 mg/L, with calcium consistently ranking highest in both seasons. The multivariate result shows several strong positive correlations among the metals (P-value <0.01). Heavy metal pollution index and metal quality index indicated high levels of Fe, Pb, As, Cd, and Cr contamination, exceeding WHO permissible levels. Major tributaries and local farming practices are potential contamination sources. Regular monitoring systems and actions are recommended.

Numerous studies have delved into the impact of the temperature on permafrost thawing and degradation. However, fewer have focused on the increase in ground ice within permafrost and the contribution of precipitation. In this paper, we integrate the optical remote sensing, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) technologies to explore the dynamic change in permafrost ice within the Zonag Lake-Salt Lake basin (ZSLB) region. First, a novel method combining InSAR and robust seasonal-trend decomposition algorithm (RobustSTL) was proposed to derive longterm deformation and seasonal amplitude of permafrost. Then, the cross-wavelet transform (XWT) method was utilized to explore the relationship between the deformation and climate factors. After that, the lake areas were extracted through the optical remote sensing images, and the water level of the lake was estimated using the ICESat-2 data. Finally, the volume of increased ground ice in ZSLB is estimated based on the ground deformation derived from InSAR. Our findings indicate that deformation rates in the study area from 2017 to 2021 ranged from-60.7 to 21.6 mm yr-1. We observed that permafrost surface uplift is more sensitive to change in precipitation, whereas surface subsidence is more responsive to change in temperature. The rate of change in stored water corresponding to the increase in the subsurface permafrost ice content from 2019 to 2021 is approximately 16.54 3 106 m3 yr-1, accounting for about 7.1% of the annual average rainfall. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the permafrost dynamic in the ZSLB and the impact of ground ice changes on hydrological processes.					zhang, zhengjia/GWA-0586-2022	zhang, zhengjia/0000-0003-0930-6914													0894-8755	1520-0442				JUN	2025	38	12					2719	2737		10.1175/JCLI-D-24-0382.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-24-0382.1													WOS:001528672100001

Improving irrigation water use efficiency (WUE) is critical for ensuring long-term water sustainability. This study explores water use efficiency (WUE) in southwest Michigan's humid climate, focusing on improving irrigation management practices. Several different volumes and frequencies of irrigation (30%, 50%, and 60% Maximum Allowable Depletion) were examined as experimental treatments to better understand their impact on crop productivity. Despite testing an array of different experimental irrigation treatments, we found no statistical differences but noted unequal averages and data spreads. These trends suggest more samples, under typical climatic conditions, are needed to distinguish which irrigation approaches enhance WUE. We also contrasted producers' methods with experimental treatments, highlighting the challenges of optimizing WUE in the region's climate and soil conditions even with experience in irrigation management. This study was conducted as a demonstration study for the benefit of producers, with the intention of providing a reference for their irrigation management practices.

However, the influence of mainstream and confluence discharges on the backwater effect in a river reach remains unclear. In this study, various hydrological data collected from the Jingjiang Reach of the Yangtze River in China were statistically analyzed to determine the backwater degree and range with three representative mainstream discharges. The results indicated that the backwater degree increased with mainstream discharge, and a positive relationship was observed between the runoff ratio and backwater degree at specific representative mainstream discharges. Following the operation of the Three Gorges Project, the backwater effect in the Jingjiang Reach diminished. For instance, mean backwater degrees for low, moderate, and high mainstream discharges were recorded as 0.83 m, 1.61 m, and 2.41 m during the period from 1990 to 2002, whereas these values decreased to 0.30 m, 0.95 m, and 2.08 m from 2009 to 2020. The backwater range extended upstream as mainstream discharge increased from 7 000 m3/s to 30 000 m3/s. Moreover, a random forest-based machine learning model was used to quantify the backwater effect with varying mainstream and confluence discharges, accounting for the impacts of mainstream discharge, confluence discharge, and channel degradation in the Jingjiang Reach. At the Jianli Hydrological Station, a decrease in mainstream discharge during flood seasons resulted in a 7%-15% increase in monthly mean backwater degree, while an increase in mainstream discharge during dry seasons led to a 1%-15% decrease in monthly mean backwater degree. Furthermore, increasing confluence discharge from Dongting Lake during June to July and September to November resulted in an 11%-42% increase in monthly mean backwater degree. Continuous channel degradation in the Jingjiang Reach contributed to a 6%-19% decrease in monthly mean backwater degree. Under the influence of these factors, the monthly mean backwater degree in 2017 varied from a decrease of 53% to an increase of 37% compared to corresponding values in 1991.

Subsequent investigations during the 2021-2022 double-cropping rice seasons revealed that the tillering stage emerged as a critical drainage period, with 49.5% and 52.2% of total drainage occurring during this phase in early and late rice, respectively. Multiscale drainage heterogeneity displayed distinct patterns, with early rice following a "decrease-increase" trend while late rice exhibited "decrease-peak-decline" dynamics. Smaller scales (field and lateral canal) produced 37.1% higher drainage than larger scales (main canal and small watershed) during the reviving stage. In contrast, post-jointing-booting stages showed 103.6% higher drainage at larger scales. Return flow utilization peaked at the field-lateral canal scales, while dynamic regulation of Fangxi Lake's storage capacity achieved 60% reuse efficiency at the watershed scale. We propose an integrated optimization strategy combining tillering-stage irrigation/drainage control, multiscale hydraulic interception (control gates and pond weirs), and dynamic watershed storage scheduling. This framework provides theoretical and practical insights for enhancing water use efficiency and mitigating non-point source pollution in plain irrigation districts.																				2077-0472				MAY 29	2025	15	11							1178	10.3390/agriculture15111178	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15111178													WOS:001505717000001

Based on the monitoring results of phytoplankton, the study selected 20 candidate indicators and conducted range screening, discriminative ability analysis, and correlation analysis. Finally, seven core indicators were determined to construct the Phytoplankton Biological Integrity Index (P-IBI) evaluation system. The rating standards were determined by the ratio method, and the phytoplankton integrity of Jiangsu Province was evaluated. The differences were analyzed. As the results showed, the overall health status of rivers in Jiangsu Province was general. From the point of view of the basin scope, the Huaihe River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin were in sub-healthy state, and the Taihu Lake Basin was general. There were significant differences in the phytoplankton density community structure in the Yangtze River, Huaihe River, and Taihu Lake Basins. Phytoplankton integrity was positively correlated with total nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, but not with other environmental factors. Nitrogen is the main factor affecting the integrity of river phytoplankton in Jiangsu Province.																				2073-4441				MAY 29	2025	17	11							1645	10.3390/w17111645	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17111645													WOS:001507552400001

Two high-resolution simulations were inter-compared, one using standard land use databases to initialize the WRF-ARW numerical model and the other using a high-resolution urban canopy formulation and detailed land use databases to initialize the WRF-UCM numerical model. Two squall lines organized and propagated over Chicago during an eight-hour period. The (1 km) spatio-temporal evolution of the first squall line was more accurately simulated by the WRF-UCM than that simulated by the WRF-ARW. The WRF-UCM captures more realistic urban heat island-induced buoyancy forcing when validated against multiple airport meteograms and Doppler radar-derived reflectivity and precipitation. The WRF-UCM increases surface heating, substantially strengthening the surface-based convective available potential energy (SBCAPE) and subsequent cold downdrafts. Additionally, the increased surface heating acts to strengthen and bifurcate the upper-level divergence and energize three low-level jets that converge upon the city and shape the convective organization. While the effect of this additional buoyancy on the first squall line was critical, the second line's dissipation was not substantially different in the two simulations because of diminishing tropospheric forcing.																				2073-4433				MAY 27	2025	16	6							652	10.3390/atmos16060652	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16060652													WOS:001515203900001
J	Dívrík, MT				Divrik, Menekse Tas			Assessment of water quality in Yapialtin Dam Lake (Sivas, Turkey) during dry and rainy seasons using various parameters and water quality indices	JOURNAL OF THE SERBIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												There are many dam lakes in the & Scedil;ark & imath;& scedil;la district of Sivas, where agricultural activities are intense. Yap & imath;alt & imath;n Dam Lake, which constitutes our study area, is one of them. The research was conducted at three stations in Yap & imath;alt & imath;n Dam Lake during the dry season in August 2023 and the rainy season in May 2024. Eighteen physicochemical variables of lake water were measured. The quality of dam lake water was assessed using indices such as the index (NPI) and water quality index (WQI). The similarity of the stations in terms of physicochemical parameters was determined using Bray-Curtis similarity analysis. Additionally, Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses were employed to examine the relationships among the physicochemical data. The analyses revealed seasonal variations in all water quality indices. In conclusion, the study provides recommendations for the sustainable use of the dam lake.																			0352-5139						2025	90	5					681	691		10.2298/JSC240917109D	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/JSC240917109D		MAY 2025											WOS:001504379600001

Here, we presented a high-resolution (1 km) reconstruction of paleo-changes in the upper range limits of trees across the Tibetan Plateau, at 100-year intervals since the Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 22 kyr BP). This reconstruction was developed by integrating multi-satellite-derived high-resolution map, in situ dendrochronological observation and paleoclimate dataset into a novel climate-driven predictive model. The model accounts for climate change effects, such as growing season temperatures and local climatic stressors, as well as migration time-lags. Validation demonstrated that the reconstructed paleo-shifts in the upper range limit of trees show strong consistency with dendrochronological reconstructions at the century timescale, corresponding with fossil pollen records from lake sediments during the Holocene period, and supported by phylogeographic evidence. This spatial-temporal explicit database enables the estimation of how paleo-changes in the upper range limit of trees have influenced regional biodiversity, offering critical insights into future changes in high-elevational-trees and their broader regional impacts.

However, recent reports indicate a shift towards prolonged stratification, reduced seasonal mixing depth, and a decline in fish productivity, consistent with the effects of climate warming. This study aimed to investigate the perceived changes in the mixing and stratification regime by comparing historical (2004-2006) and current data to determine the magnitude of climate warming on the lake's hydrodynamic properties. From 2018 to 2020, daily measurements of meteorological variables, including temperature, wind speed, and rainfall within the crater, were recorded at an onshore weather station. Monthly data on water column temperature, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductivity were collected, and Schmidt stability was calculated. Time series analyses suggest alterations in the stratification and mixing patterns of the lake induced by air temperature and wind speed forcing. The air temperature increased from 26.56 degrees C (SD = 3.13) to 27.28 degrees C (SD = 3.32) resulting in a 0.30 degrees C rise in the water column, greater thermal stability and a decline in dissolved oxygen concentration with depth. There appears to be a notable shift in the timing and intensity of the mixing period, transitioning from August to September, attributed to diminished convective cooling processes. Evidence indicates a transition from a holomictic state to meromictic. This transformation in the lake's hydrodynamics will affect nutrient renewal rates and primary productivity, with implications for water quality, fisheries, ecotourism, and livelihood activities vital to the lake communities.

It is located in the south of T & uuml;rkiye and used for tourism, irrigation and drinking water. Ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), sulfate (SO4-2), bicarbonate (HCO3-), orthophosphate (PO4-P), chloride (Cl-), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), temperature (degrees C), dissolved oxygen, pH, and electrical conductivity were measured. Water quality was determined according to the Surface Water Quality Regulation (SWQR) and Water Quality Index (WQI). The water quality classes of the stream, based on epilithic diatom assemblages, were determined using the Generic Diatom Index (GDI), Saprobi Index (SI), Trophic Index (TI), Swiss Diatom Index (DI-CH), and Trophic Diatom Index (TDI). According to SWQR, the average values of the parameters at all sites were generally in the class I or II (high quality or lightly polluted water). WQI, was calculated based on seasonal and site and all results were determined as "excellent water". 117 taxa belonging to 51 genera of epilithic diatoms were observed in the K & ouml;pr & uuml;& ccedil;ay River. According to epilithic diatoms, generally all sites were in the range of very slightly polluted or partially polluted (I and II) water quality classes.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2025	59	3					877	906		10.1007/s10452-025-10202-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-025-10202-0		MAY 2025											WOS:001493388700001

Hyperacid lake monitoring from Poás Volcano, Costa Rica, using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)	PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY												Po & aacute;s Volcano is a complex stratovolcano in Costa Rica's Central Mountain Range and hosts acidic volcanic lakes. This study uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to monitor the physicochemical characteristics of the hyperacid crater lake. Sampling was conducted in January and May of 2024, using a DJI Matrice 600 Pro equipped with a water collection system. The results showed extremely low pH values (as low as -1.04), high temperatures (up to 64 degrees C), and high concentrations of sulfate (134 877 ppm) and chloride (88 434 ppm), highlighting the influence of volcanic activity on the chemical composition of the hyperacid lake water. Sampling was marked by a decrease in rainfall patterns during the dry season and a reduction in the lake's water volume, indicating a high evaporation rate and the release of gases and ash. The SO4 2-/Cl- ratio was relatively constant, with no increase in activity and that meant that it was safe for tourism, based on the physicochemical characteristics of the hyperacid crater lake.																			0033-4545	1365-3075				2025 MAY 22	2025										10.1515/pac-2025-0427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pac-2025-0427		MAY 2025											WOS:001495419700001

Using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) as bases, in this study, the applicability of the vegetation health index (VHI) within the basin is investigated, and the optimal weight distribution between the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) in the VHI is determined. The VHI is then applied to analyze the correlation between drought frequency and severity within the basin. The results indicate that the method is most effective in assessing agricultural drought in the Qilu Lake Basin when the VCI and TCI are weighted at a 4:6 ratio, optimizing the VHI's evaluative performance. The drought limit water levels of lakes are further divided into short- and long-term drought limit water levels. The short-term drought limit water level is divided into the drought warning water level and the drought emergency water level. The drought warning water level (corresponding to moderate drought conditions, with a frequency of P = 75%) ranges from 1794.53 m to 1795.11 m, while the drought emergency water level (corresponding to extreme drought conditions, with a frequency of P = 95%) ranges from 1793.94 m to 1794.31 m. These levels are set to meet the emergency water demand during droughts in the basin. The long-term drought limit water levels are calculated by accumulating the water deficits of various sectors within the watershed under different agricultural drought conditions, based on the short-term drought limit water levels. By setting the drought limit water level using this method, as well as considering the original water regulation capacity of the lake resources, when the watershed experiences drought, the scheduling method based on this drought limit water level can better alleviate the water supply pressure on various sectors in the local area.																				2071-1050				MAY 19	2025	17	10							4662	10.3390/su17104662	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17104662													WOS:001496979300001

From bay to boat: An assessment of commercial catch in Green Bay, Lake Michigan	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Populations of Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis have supported commercial fisheries in the Laurentian Great Lakes for centuries, and while recent basinwide trends are down, the Lake Whitefish population resident to the waters of Green Bay has experienced an increasing trend since at least the early 2000s, partly attributable to reestablished river-spawning populations and productivity. The result is amplified commercial harvest in parts of the lower bay and an interest in increasing harvest quotas. The central goal of this study was to provide managers with a more precise understanding of spatial and temporal distribution of Lake Whitefish and nontarget species catch associated with the commercial fishery within the Wisconsin waters of Green Bay, Lake Michigan. The specific objectives of our work were to (1) quantify commercially harvested and discarded Lake Whitefish within Green Bay, (2) determine the rate and incidence of capture of nontarget species, and (3) establish an estimate for the levels of direct fishing mortality of discarded Lake Whitefish and nontarget species. We also aimed to determine whether predictive relationships exist between harvest, discards, and mortality and external drivers and/or fishing practices as reported elsewhere.Methods Using onboard monitoring sampling techniques, a numeric estimate of catch, bycatch, and mortality of Lake Whitefish and nontarget species was obtained. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) calculations were applied across a spatial and temporal scale. These estimates were also compared with commercial fisher self-reported values on monitored fishing days using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Further, generalized additive models were used to determine associations of observed catch and mortality with environmental and fishing-related factors such as water temperature, depth, and soak time.Results A total of 389 commercial trap-net lifts were observed from April to September during the 2021 commercial fishing season. We observed 129,345 Lake Whitefish, with 63,061 harvested and 66,284 discarded. Mean observed discard mortality was estimated at approximately 2% in nets. The majority of observed Lake Whitefish harvest occurred in June and was generally associated with factors including water depth, soak time, and surface water temperature. Fisher self-reported values of harvest were not significantly different from monitored values; however, there was a significant difference in reported and monitored values of discards. A total of 2,941 nontarget fish were observed. Walleye Sander vitreus, a key sport fish in the area, composed 38.8% of all observed nontarget fish and were predominately caught during April, May, June, and September. The difference in the reported and monitored values of Walleye was marginally not significant.Conclusions Lake Whitefish harvest and discards in Green Bay occurred largely in zone 1 (southern Green Bay) with concentrated fishing effort. The CPUE was greatest for Lake Whitefish during the middle of the fishing season. The CPUE of nontarget species bycatch, especially Walleye, occurred mostly in zone 1 and during the early and late fishing season. There is little evidence that suggests that self-reported harvest is inaccurate; however, discards and bycatch may be underreported and worthy of further consideration. It is probable that some environmental drivers may be playing a role in Lake Whitefish and bycatch trends; however, further data are necessary to increase predictive power of models. The results of this study aids managers and fishers in finding a balance between optimizing Lake Whitefish harvest while mitigating the potential impacts of the commercial fishery on nontarget fishes. Onboard monitoring provided insight into spatial and temporal patterns of targeted catch and bycatch in Green Bay's Lake Whitefish commercial fishing industry. The information in this study could be vital for informing if total allowable catch is within sustainable limits and other future management objectives surrounding the Lake Whitefish commercial fishery.

Alison; Vahedifard, Farshid; Silver, Roxane Cohen			Understanding climate change anxiety and anticipatory climate disaster stress: A survey of residents in a high-risk California county during wildfire season	BMJ MENTAL HEALTH												Background With the increasing prevalence of climate-related disasters, psychological responses, including climate change anxiety and anticipatory climate disaster stress, have received heightened attention.Objective We investigate the correlates of climate change anxiety and anticipatory climate disaster stress, as well as the nature of these psychological responses.Methods At the start of the annual fire season (June to August 2023), we recruited a county-representative sample of n=813 residents of Lake County, in Northern California, to complete an anonymous online survey. Multiple regression analyses identified correlates of climate change anxiety and anticipatory climate disaster stress and explored how anxiety and stress were associated with disaster preparedness.Findings Climate change anxiety, assessed via its cognitive-emotional impairment (odds ratio (OR)loss/injury=1.68; ORmedia=2.37) and functional impairment (ORloss/injury=1.68; ORmedia=2.63) subfactors, and anticipatory climate disaster stress (bloss/injury=0.15, bmedia=0.26) were associated with previous wildfire-induced loss/injury and media exposure to wildfire-related content. Anticipatory climate disaster stress was also associated with the frequency of being in an evacuation zone (b=0.05). Both the cognitive-emotional impairment subfactor of climate change anxiety (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.23) and anticipatory climate disaster stress (IRR=1.14) were associated with preparing an emergency kit and power outage supplies; anticipatory climate disaster stress was associated with evacuation intentions should an actual fire occur (b=0.12).Conclusions Prior experiences with climate disasters could explain people's psychological responses to climate change. These responses could be temporally appropriate and functionally adaptive, given the immediacy of a potential fire.Clinical implications Climate change anxiety and anticipatory climate disaster stress should not be oversimplified as typical clinical symptoms because their presence might motivate adaptive self-protective behaviours in the face of an upcoming disaster.					; Tao, Junchen/AGL-3611-2022; Tao, Tiffany/AGL-3611-2022	Vahedifard, Farshid/0000-0001-8883-4533; Estes, Kayley/0000-0001-5269-9878; Silver, Roxane Cohen/0000-0002-4013-6792; Holman, E.

Our results indicate a general decline in Chl-a concentrations, suggesting a mitigation of eutrophication. However, significant regional and seasonal disparities persist, reflecting varying ecological conditions and anthropogenic influences. Elevated Chl-a concentrations were predominantly observed in regions with intensive agricultural and urban areas, such as the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Pearl River Delta, and the North China Plain. In contrast, lower concentrations were recorded in areas with extensive forest and grassland cover, such as the northeast and southwest. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) were the primary factors influencing Chl-a levels during the growing season, while water temperature (W-T), CODMn, and pH had greater impacts in the non-growing season. Categorized according to the key factors influencing Chl-a concentration, 52 lakes were divided into 7 categories, and future Chl-a concentrations were projected using data from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre and the China Environmental Status Bulletin. Specifically, we estimate a 3.060% annual decrease in CODMn and a 2.748% annual decrease in NH3-N, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), alongside a 0.350% annual increase in water temperature. These projections suggest that while most lakes are expected to see reductions in Chl-a concentrations, some CODMn-sensitive and water temperature-sensitive lakes may still experience increases, underscoring the complexity of interactions between multiple environmental factors. To address these dynamics, we recommend targeted management strategies, including reducing nutrient and organic matter inputs, enhancing ecological protection measures, and closely monitoring temperature fluctuations to mitigate the risk of algal blooms and maintain lake health.

Measuring various environmental and cyanobacterial parameters in water samples can be useful for monitoring water quality and assessing risk but remains a short-term approach. Beyond local risk assessments, estimating global and medium-term levels of freshwater contamination by MC-producing cyanobacteria is challenging in large lakes due to the spatio-temporal variability of their proliferation and the need to multiply sampling dates and locations. In such conditions, a sentinel organism can be valuable for monitoring MCs in situ and providing a time-integrated picture of contamination levels at various stations. We previously assessed the ability of the freshwater bivalves Anodonta anatina and Dreissena polymorpha to act as biointegrators of MCs, even under low exposure levels to cyanobacteria. In this study, through a two-season investigation in several French lakes experiencing moderate cyanobacterial blooms, we evaluated the relevance of various parameters (cyanobacterial density and biovolume, chlorophyll-a, and phycocyanin) as well as the use of bivalves as indicators of medium-term freshwater contamination by MC-producing cyanobacteria. MC concentrations in cyanobacterial biomass (intracellular MCs) and in bivalves (free MCs, being unbound, and total free and protein-bound accumulated MCs) were measured alongside the characterization of phytoplankton communities. Both mussels integrated and highlighted the presence of intracellular MCs in the environment over the period between two successive water samplings, even at low contamination levels, demonstrating their suitability for in situ biomonitoring of MC-producing cyanobacteria. The results are discussed in terms of the strengths and limitations of different parameters for assessing MC contamination levels in waters depending on the objective (managing, preventing, or global evaluation) and the monitoring strategies used.

Succession of phytoplankton functional groups in a subtropical lake associated with rainfall patterns	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Climate change is expected to drive significant alterations in rainfall patterns, which will pose considerable threats and pressures on aquatic ecosystems. Phytoplankton, as a critical component of these ecosystems and a reliable biological indicator of environmental health, may respond variably to such climatic changes. However, our understanding of how phytoplankton communities respond to climate change remains limited. In this study, we investigated the response of phytoplankton functional groups to rainfall patterns and their relationships with environment factors in a subtropical eutrophic lake (Changhu Lake, China) from May 2020 to April 2022. Our findings indicate that changes in phytoplankton functional structure over time were influenced by rainfall patterns. A total of 119 genera, 21 functional groups, and 15 dominant functional groups were identified, with the dominant functional groups exhibiting strong seasonal variations. Notably, shifts in rainfall patterns led to a transition in dominant phytoplankton functional groups: from taxa tolerant of mixing and low nitrogen levels (e.g., H1, J, and S1) during the rainy season to taxa that thrive under eutrophic and stratified conditions (e.g., X2, C, N, and W1) during the dry season. The use of phytoplankton functional approaches simplifies identification and reflects environmental conditions effectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed strong correlations between changes in phytoplankton functional groups and environmental factors such as water temperature, precipitation, water level, and nutrient availability. The insights from this study improve our understanding of how aquatic ecosystems shift under climate change and demonstrate the potential of phytoplankton functional responses as a valuable tool for water management and conservation.

Prey selection and dietary nutrient composition of an endangered amphibian, the Titicaca water frog (Telmatobius culeus)	SALAMANDRA												It is important to understand the foraging strategies of an endangered species, in this way to evaluate the possible consequences of ecological changes. This study describes the availability of food resources for the Endangered Titicaca water frog Telmatobius culeus in one locality in Titicaca Lake and shows how potential prey abundance can be affected by season or depth of water. Insights about the diet composition and prey selection are provided together with nutritional information of its potential prey items. Substrate traps were installed during different seasons and different depths to collect potential prey items, gut content analysis was carried out in 44 frogs and nutritional properties of potential prey items was obtained. Thirteen species of potential prey items were recorded. For some of the species such as Hyalella spp., Heleobia sp. and Biomphalaria sp., the data indicated a seasonal and spatial variation of the prey items. Amphipod Hyalella spp. and snails Heleobia sp. and Biomphalaria sp. were the main prey items consumed by frogs. Diet did not differ between males and females. The diet of small frogs was dominated by Hyalella spp., in contrast to the diet of large frogs which consumed a greater diversity of prey types. Telmatobius culeus selected Heleobia sp. from all the available prey items from its environment. Calcium:phosphorus ratios, that when inverse can contribute to metabolic bone disease, were high in Hyalella spp. but this prey item was relatively low in crude protein and gross energy compared with other species besides Heleobia sp. and Biomphalaria sp. This study provides ecological information about Telmatobius culeus that can be useful for in-situ and ex-situ conservation efforts: (1) the identification of prey items will allow monitoring and eventually managing the ecosystem, (2) it indicates which prey items need to be cultured in captivity, and (3) how captive diets should be adapted to optimally mimic the natural diet of Telmatobius culeus.

It reduces water availability and biodiversity in these areas. This study aimed to predict the spread of water hyacinth using GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation and Sentinel-2 imagery. Field collections were conducted in both lakes during the wet and dry seasons of 2020. A multivariate statistical classifier was employed to map the spatial distribution of water hyacinth. The results indicate that in Lake Koka, coverage increased from 3.87% (1455.39 ha) in the dry season to 12.44% (4678.06 ha) in the wet season. In Lake Ziway, coverage ranged from 10.01% (6526.30 ha) to 11.39% (7424.05 ha) between the seasons. These findings highlight the significant proliferation of water hyacinth during the rainy season, which harms biodiversity and socioeconomic development. Additionally, the study found a decrease in the area covered by water hyacinths in agricultural land, water bodies, and bare land. Restoring land use and monitoring weed growth regularly is essential to mitigate these effects.

J	Miess, S; Strand, M				Miess, Sam; Strand, Mac			From stream to surf zone: Differences in the composition and succession of Lake Superior macroinvertebrate communities	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The benthic communities in the surf zone of the Laurentian Great Lakes were historically diverse assemblages with typically lotic taxa. Conditions were suitable for these lotic taxa due to wave activity and strong, nearshore currents. Due to anthropogenic stressors, including the introduction of Dreissena mussels, surf zone communities have been all but decimated in the lower Great Lakes. Remaining communities persist along the shorelines of Lake Superior, where they are influenced by lake conditions and tributary inputs. Despite their ecological importance, the relationship between these Great Lakes surf zone communities, nearby tributary communities, and the confluence (i.e., tributary mouth) communities has remained largely unexplored. This study compared the composition and succession of Lake Superior communities at three sites: tributary, confluence, and surf zone. Hester-Dendy multiplate samplers (n = 7 per site) were deployed for similar to 28-day periods over the course of the ice-free season (May through October) to assess community composition. Although diversity was similar between sites, community composition was distinct between the sites across all sample periods. Overall, compositional shifts were greater along the shoreline community, followed by confluence and tributary communities. The magnitude of compositional shifts, as well as diversity and composition, varied across the sample periods. These results suggest these communities are distinct, exhibiting compositional shifts that appear to correspond with production peaks at each site. As warmer temperatures and intensified storms affect Lake Superior in the coming decades, it is important that further research explore the ecology of tributary, confluence, and surf zone communities to better preserve these fascinating communities.																			0380-1330					JUN	2025	51	3							102580	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102580		MAY 2025											WOS:001493210800002

This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of MP occurrence and associated risks in the River Benue, one of Nigeria's most important rivers. Surface water samples were collected in September 2023 (rainy season) and January 2024 (dry season), pre-treated with NaCl and H2O2 for density separation and wet peroxide oxidation, and analysed using FTIR spectroscopy and SEM-EDS. MP abundance was higher along the southern bank, ranging from 0 to 11 items L-1 in the dry season and 0 to 9 items L-1 in the rainy season. The lower rainy-season concentrations were attributed to improved hydraulic conditions, which enhanced dilution and downstream transport. Particle sizes ranged from 0.5 to 5 mm, with the 1.5-3 mm fraction being most abundant, raising concerns due to their bioavailability. Risk assessment revealed contamination factors of 2-22 and pollution load indices of 2-4.69, indicating sites with moderate to elevated risks. The PLIzone (3.23) confirmed severe pollution across the river, potentially warranting remediation. MP distribution patterns are strongly associated with anthropogenic activities, including commerce, transportation, and waste disposal. This study provides crucial baseline data on MP pollution in River Benue and supports the development of targeted management strategies. For a more comprehensive understanding, future investigations should explore the collection of larger sample volumes and asses contamination in the sediments and biota. These findings contribute to global efforts in understanding freshwater MP pollution, particularly in understudied tropical river systems.

Fine-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing Improves Spatially Distributed Snow Modeling to Near Real Time	REMOTE SENSING												Given the highly variable distribution of seasonal snowpacks in complex mountainous environments, the accurate snow modeling of basin-wide snow water equivalent (SWE) requires a spatially distributed approach at a sufficiently fine grid resolution (<500 m) to account for the important processes in the seasonal evolution of a snowpack (e.g., wind redistribution of snow to resolve patchy snow cover in an alpine zone). However, even well-validated snow evolution models, such as SnowModel, are prone to errors when key model inputs, such as the precipitation and wind speed and direction, are inaccurate or only available at coarse spatial resolutions. Incorporating fine-spatial-resolution remotely sensed snow-covered area (SCA) information into spatially distributed snow modeling has the potential to refine and improve fine-resolution snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates. This study developed 30 m resolution SnowModel simulations across the Big Thompson River, Fraser River, Three Lakes, and Willow Creek Basins, a total area of 4212 km(2) in Colorado, for the water years 2000-2023, and evaluated the incorporation of a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat SCA datasets into the model's development and calibration. The SnowModel was calibrated spatially to the Landsat mean annual snow persistence (SP) and temporally to the MODIS mean basin SCA using a multi-objective calibration procedure executed using Latin hypercube sampling and a stepwise calibration process. The Landsat mean annual SP was also used to further optimize the SnowModel simulations through the development of a spatially variable precipitation correction field. The evaluations of the SnowModel simulations using the Airborne Snow Observatories' (ASO's) light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived SWE estimates show that the versions of the SnowModel calibrated to the remotely sensed SCA had an improved performance (mean error ranging from -28 mm to -6 mm) compared with the baseline simulations (mean error ranging from 69 mm to 86 mm), and comparable spatial patterns to those of the ASO, especially at the highest elevations. Furthermore, this study's results highlight how a regularly updated 30 m resolution SCA could be used to further improve the calibrated SnowModel simulations to near real time (latency of 5 days or less).

In this study, we propose a novel hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithm known as the ARAMT model, which combines two key components: a meta-classifier of additive regression (AR) and a base classifier of alternating model trees (AMT). The AR-AMT hybrid model significantly enhances the prediction of carbon isotopes (delta C-13) by addressing limitations in existing methodologies. For the first time, this model is used to predict the spatial prediction of a stable isotope in Polish lakes. The delta C-13 for 30 Polish lakes is determined using the calcite (CaCO3) precipitated in the near-surface layers of the lakes (epilimnion). The chemical composition (Ca2+, HCO3-, Na, K, sulfates, fluorides, Cl, Mg, and P) and temperature of the surface water at a depth of 1 m is analyzed seasonally. The current approaches for predicting delta C-13 have demonstrated shortcomings in accuracy and precision. In this study, a random forest (RF), M5P, AMT, and Gaussian process (GP) are the four cutting-edge ML algorithms that are compared with the proposed hybrid model (ARAMT). In accordance with the results, the ARAMT hybrid model performed more effectively in predicting S13C than the other benchmark ML methods (R-2 = 0.9882, MAE = 0.456, and RMSE = 0.527), the others giving: AMT (R2 = 0.982, MAE = 0.558, and RMSE = 0.347), RF (R-2 = 0.8014, MAE = 0.612, and RMSE = 0.550), M5P (R-2 = 0.7508, MAE = 0.813, and RMSE = 0.701), and GP (R-2 = 0.7315, MAE = 0.768, and RMSE = 0.683). Although the ARAMT hybrid doesn't directly preserve lake ecosystems, the enhanced accuracy of its delta C-13 predictions by providing a more detailed understanding of carbon cycling dynamics can indirectly inform and improve lake ecosystem health and management.

However, the mineral phases composing them and the signals they carry may be altered by secondary alteration during, e.g., early diagenesis. While the impact of early diagenesis has already been evidenced on some microbialites, some efforts are still needed for documenting its extent and its dependence on environmental conditions. Here, we analyzed early diagenetic transformations in shallow to deep modern microbialites formed in the seasonally stratified lake Alchichica, Mexico. We combined bulk analyses such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), with spatially resolved techniques, including petrographic microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), focused ion beam (FIB) milling and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We showed the massive diagenetic formation of huntite (CaMg3(CO3)4), a rare carbonate, in microbialites developing at depths >= 20 m in the Lake Alchichica water column. Huntite replaced aragonite (CaCO3) and hydromagnesite (Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2<middle dot>4H2O), the main primary phases forming Alchichica microbialites. The bulk isotope compositions of carbon and oxygen in carbonate phases also supported a diagenetic origin of huntite. We propose that specific conditions restricted to the pore water physicochemistry within the deep microbialites control the destabilization of the primary carbonates and the precipitation of huntite. Interestingly, thermodynamics predict that huntite instead of hydromagnesite and aragonite is the most stable phase under Lake Alchichica conditions. Yet the latter phases are dominant in most Alchichica microbialites. This suggests that the formation of huntite, similarly to that of dolomite in many surficial environments, is likely kinetically hindered and that the mineral assemblage composing microbialites does not necessarily follow thermodynamic predictions but is more controlled by kinetics. Last, the loss of luminescence in deep microbialites in comparison with shallow microbialites raises questions about the preservation of some mineralogical and biological signatures of microbialites over time.					; Lopez-Garcia, Purificacion/B-6775-2012; Benzerara, Karim/J-1532-2016	Caumartin, Jeanne/0009-0009-4921-8901; 													2472-3452					MAY 12	2025	9	6					1544	1565		10.1021/acsearthspacechem.5c00022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsearthspacechem.5c00022		MAY 2025											WOS:001485856100001

To address the limitations of traditional crop models in spatial resolution and accuracy, this study innovatively developed the HASM-APSIM coupled model by integrating High-Accuracy Surface Modeling (HASM) with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the historical yield of double-season rice in Jiangxi Province from 2000 to 2018. The methodological advancements included the following: the localized parameter optimization of APSIM using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and NSGA-II multi-objective genetic algorithm to adapt to regional rice varieties, enhancing model robustness; coarse-resolution yield simulations (10 km grids) driven by meteorological, soil, and management data; and high-resolution refinement (1 km grids) via HASM, which fused APSIM outputs with station-observed yields as optimization constraints, resolving the trade-off between accuracy and spatial granularity. The results showed that the following: (1) Compared to the APSIM model, the HASM-APSIM model demonstrated higher accuracy and reliability in simulating historical yields of double-season rice. For early rice, the R-value increased by 14.67% (0.75 -> 0.86), RMSE decreased by 34.02% (838.50 -> 553.21 kg/hm2), MAE decreased by 31.43% (670.92 -> 460.03 kg/hm2), and MAPE dropped from 11.03% to 7.65%. For late rice, the R-value improved by 27.42% (0.62 -> 0.79), RMSE decreased by 36.75% (959.0 -> 606.58 kg/hm2), MAE reduced by 26.37% (718.05 -> 528.72 kg/hm2), and MAPE declined from 11.05% to 8.08%. (2) Significant spatiotemporal variations in double-season rice yields were observed in Jiangxi Province. Temporally, the simulated yields of early and late rice aligned with statistical yields in terms of numerical distribution and interannual trends, but simulated yields exhibited greater fluctuations. Spatially, high-yield zones for early rice were concentrated in the eastern and central regions, while late rice high-yield areas were predominantly distributed around Poyang Lake. The 1 km resolution outputs enabled the precise identification of yield heterogeneity, supporting targeted agricultural interventions. (3) The growth rate of double-season rice yield is slowing down. To safeguard food security, the study area needs to boost the development of high-yield and high-quality crop varieties and adopt region-specific strategies. The model proposed in this study offers a novel approach for simulating crop yield at the regional scale. The findings provide a scientific basis for agricultural production planning and decision-making in Jiangxi Province and help promote the sustainable development of the double-season rice industry.

Biological Diversity Associated with Pesticides Residues in Certain Egyptian Watercourses	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The aquatic environment has been contaminated by pyrethroids and triazole pesticide applications, which pose serious health risks to the aquatic ecosystem and human beings. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate water quality parameters, fungal diversity, and distribution of snails and aquatic plants of certain Egyptian water courses contaminated with pyrethroids and triazole pesticides. Seasonal samples were taken throughout 2021 from different water courses at Giza Governorate and Tanta (Gharbeya Governorate). Qualitative and quantitative surveys showed significant differences in water physical parameters between the two investigated governorates. Deltamethrin, permethrin, Es-fenvalerate, and lambada-cyhalothrin showed the highest pyrethroids concentrations, while tebuconazole, tetraconazole, and difenoconazole were the highest triazole concentrations. Fungal diversity displayed 21 molecularly identified fungal species related to four fungal genera: Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma. Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus niger were the most frequent species. Snail diversity recorded 10 and 9 species in Giza and Tanta, respectively. Physa acuta was the most abundant snail. Ten species of aquatic plants were observed in Giza, while six species were observed in Tanta. Specifically, Eichhornia crassipes and Lemna gibba were the dominant species in the two governorates, with the relative abundance (39 and 22%) in Giza and (27 and 23%) in Tanta, respectively. Water quality parameters and seasonal variations could control fungal diversity, snails, and aquatic plant distribution. Different relations between pesticides and biological communities may reflect the ability/inability of certain snails and fungi species to commensalism with pesticide concentrations. Continuous pesticide monitoring is essential for life below water and aligns with SDG14.

One of the characteristics of this volcano is the hot acidic lake located in its crater, which has undergone various changes in the past 20 years, as a result of different eruptive phases. In particular, between 2018 and 2022, changes in the crater lake level were associated with periods of increased surface activity, characterized by phreatic eruptions and SO2 emissions into the atmosphere. We carried out a multiparametric analysis, finding correlations between the crater lake hydric balance with annual seasonal changes, gas and ash emissions, and temporal variations in the tremor seismic signal. These correlations allowed us to infer that during the cold months, the ambient temperature prevents the thaw that feeds the shallow hydrothermal system, favoring evaporation and reduction of the crater lake volume. Consequently, less efficient heat dissipation and sulfur scrubbing processes favors vent sealing, likely dominated by liquid sulfur and precipitation of secondary minerals in the shallow hydrothermal conduits. Eventually, the gas pressure in the conduits reaches a critical state, which is manifested through increased tremor activity. When the seal is ruptured, an abrupt drop in the seismic signal is observed. This activity is followed by phreatic eruptions or large SO2 releases into the atmosphere. This crater lake behavior has occurred annually from 2018 to 2022, evidencing a seasonal control on the shallow hydrothermal system and the phreatic activity of Copahue volcano.

Here we present the results of comprehensive research in Prolosko Blato karst wetland situated in one of the largest karst poljes in Croatia-Imotsko Polje. The Prolosko Blato is characterized by sinkholes filled with water (karst lakes) and seasonally flooded karst polje. The sediments were retrieved using coring and profile sampling in erosional channels during the dry season. Geomorphological characteristics were analyzed using the digital elevation model (DEM), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) and ground penetrating radar (GPR). Morphology and bathymetry of karst lakes were investigated using sub-bottom profiling and sidescan sonar survey. The evolution of the Prolosko Blato can be tracked from the Last Glacial Period when alluvial fan sedimentation was the dominant process in the karst polje. The alluvial sedimentation ceased with coarse-grained (gravel) deposition in the distal part of the alluvial fan during the deglaciation period (after similar to 19.000 cal yr BP). During the Early Holocene, a progressive deepening of the basin enabled the development of a shallow lake/wetland characterized by enhanced detrital input, thus suggesting wetter climate conditions between ca. 9000 and 8000 cal yr BP. This is followed by a relatively long period (from ca. 8000 to 800 cal yr BP) of lacustrine carbonate sedimentation in a deeper lacustrine environment. Around 800 cal yr BP, sediments are characterized by disturbed clayey/carbonate sediments with numerous intercalations, pointing to a disturbance in the paleolake. At the same time, geomorphological characteristics of the area suggest sinkhole formation in the paleolake's marginal part, which hypothetically led to the desiccation of the paleolake and the establishment of a modern seasonally flooded karst wetland. This research demonstrated the existence of Holocene paleolake sediments in Prolosko Blato, thus confirming that karst poljes contain valuable terrestrial paleoclimate/paleoenvironmental sediment archives.

Three growth media (Salmonella-Shigella agar, Brilliant Green agar, and Chromo-select agar) were used for microbial plating targeting Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae spp. qPCR Taqman Probe-based assay was used for detection of E. coli (uidA), Salmonella (invA), Campylobacter (glyA), and Shigella (ipaH). Potentially toxic elements concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, Zn and Pb were not detected in any of the sites for either season whereas concentrations of Cd and Cr exceeded the WHO drinking water guidelines (Cd: 0.003 mg/L; Cr: 0.05 mg/L), posing chronic health risk. Shapiro-Wilk test was employed to assess the distribution of data. Kruskal-Wallis H test and Mann-Whitney U test predicted the significance between seasons. Bacterial analysis revealed significant seasonal variability, with higher concentrations of Salmonella spp. and E. coli in the Nurpur Stream during the wet season, while others exhibited spatial variations. No statistically significant differences were observed in concentrations of potentially toxic elements across seasons. qPCR confirmed E. coli detection in both seasons except filtration plant. Interpolation techniques were employed to highlight their spatial distribution. Pollution risk classification maps showed various levels of toxicity at all sampling sites. This study stressed the significance of monitoring and highlighting quality of water for ensuring public health.

Based on MODIS image from 2001 to 2020, we studied the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) in Poyang Lake. Using M-K (Mann-Kendall) test and slope trend analysis method, we studied its abrupt change and overall trend. Poyang Lake water area data and DEM data were used to analyze the change in NDVI with water area and investigate the relationship between NDVI and elevation. The results showed that the changing trend of NDVI value in 20 years was relatively stable, mostly not significant, and the number of pixels accounted for 88.55% of the whole lake area. The proportion of NDVI increasing trend was greater than that of decreasing trend, which was 9.18% and 2.27%, respectively. Affected by the water level, the seasonal variation of NDVI in the Poyang Lake area was significant. The water area was negatively correlated with NDVI value. But the elevation was positively correlated with NDVI value. The results revealed the spatial distribution and the variation characteristics of NDVI in Poyang Lake, which was of great significance for vegetation protection and ecological environment evaluation of Poyang Lake.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				2025 MAY 7	2025										10.1007/s10201-025-00798-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-025-00798-5		MAY 2025											WOS:001483435900001

However, accurate extraction of individual aquaculture pond boundaries from mesoscale remote sensing images remains a significant challenge. In this work, we developed the Multi-source Object-oriented Framework for extracting Aquaculture ponds (MOFA) to address mapping challenges in the Chaohu Lake basin, China. The MOFA combined Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with Sentinel-2 data, applying an object-oriented approach with adaptive threshold segmentation for robust and automated aquaculture pond delineation. Our performance evaluation results showed that the overall accuracy is as high as 90.75%. The MOFA is thus capable of distinguishing seasonal water bodies, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers from individual (non-centralized, contiguous) aquaculture ponds. Our results showed that the central and south sections of the Chaohu Lake basin are characterized by denser aquaculture pond distributions, relative to those in the western basin. The total area of aquaculture ponds across the entire basin decreased from 19,297.86 hm2 in 2016 to 18,262.77 hm2 in 2023, which is likely attributed to local policy adjustments, resource optimization, shifting market demands, or natural environmental changes. The abandonment and unregulated expansion of aquaculture ponds threaten sustainable development. Local governments must implement adaptive governance strategies to balance ecological preservation with economic growth. Overall, the MOFA can quickly and accurately extract and map aquaculture ponds, and further support the scientific planning of sustainable aquaculture development.																				2073-4441				MAY 7	2025	17	9							1406	10.3390/w17091406	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17091406													WOS:001486296400001

We investigate lake heatwaves (LHWs) in the Eastern Mediterranean, where dust intrusions are frequently observed. The dust intrusions are characterized by the arrival of warm air masses containing dust pollution from the desert. In saline lakes, LHWs caused by dust intrusions have not been investigated in previous studies. In our study we focus on this point. It was found for the first time that, in the hypersaline Dead Sea, a severe dust intrusion (aerosol optical depth of over 3) caused the formation of LHWs, as appeared in September 2015. At the water surface, the LHWs were represented by abnormally high daily maximal and minimal surface water temperature (SWT) in comparison with their seasonally varied 90th percentile thresholds for 10 consecutive days (7-17 September). The surface LHWs' intensity was up to 3 degrees C. Satellite (MODIS-Terra and METEOSAT) SWT did not detect the LHWs. Surface LHWs were accompanied by subsurface LHWs down to a depth of 20 m. The subsurface LHWs lasted longer (16 days) than the surface LHWs (10 days). There was a 4-day delay between the first date of the surface LHWs (7 September) and the start date of the subsurface LHWs (11 September). The maximal intensity of the subsurface LHWs decreased with depth from 1 m (0.6 degrees C) down to 5 m (0.3 degrees C), followed by an increase (up to 0.6 degrees C) at the deeper layers (from 10 m to 20 m). Taking into account that, over the Eastern Mediterranean, desert dust has increased during the past several decades, one can expect frequent occurrence of dust-related intense persistent heatwaves in the Dead Sea in the coming years. This will contribute to additional water heating and further drying up of the Dead Sea.

Reconstructing Holocene temperatures, especially in such regions, provides unique insights into this unresolved issue and helps explore the mechanisms of temperature variability, which is essential for future climate predictions. To address these uncertainties, additional paleotemperature records are crucial. In this study, we quantitatively reconstruct the mean annual temperature (MAT) from the Hongyuan Peatland in the eastern Tibetan Plateau spanning 13,300 years, using phytoliths as a proxy-a method not previously applied in this area. Our reconstruction reveals a gradual warming trend throughout the Holocene, supported by model simulations and compiled results. Comparisons of temperatures with previous reconstructions from Hongyuan Peatland reveal that proxy seasonality influences temperature trends. Moreover, the calibration sets, the topsoil datasets, the characteristics of the proxies, and the model components can influence the amplitudes of temperature changes. Comparisons of phytolith-based temperature records across China show that Holocene temperature trends vary with latitude, which is related to annual insolation. In the eastern Tibetan Plateau, variations in MAT during the Holocene can be attributed to increasing mean annual solar radiation, rising CO2 concentrations, and the melting of ice sheets. Our study assesses the potential of phytoliths as a reliable proxy for paleotemperature reconstruction in high-elevation areas and confirms the warming trend of MAT in the eastern Tibetan Plateau.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				AUG 15	2025	672								112997	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112997	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112997		MAY 2025											WOS:001487363700001

Continuous nutrient monitoring efforts in collaboration with community members require cost-effective but information-rich methods. Data gathered through community-science approaches could enhance source water protection programs and can provide first-hand knowledge and expertise through reciprocal information exchange with local community members. Yet, there are still misconceptions about the validity of data gathered by community scientists. This study validates the use of two inexpensive nutrient monitoring devices (YSI 9500 Photometer and the Nutrient Smartphone App) for community-based environmental research by testing the accuracy of each device, identifying nutrient hotspots, and determining if nutrient concentrations relate to precipitation patterns in a drought-prone region of Saskatchewan within the Lake Winnipeg Basin in Canada. We found that the measurement accuracy of these devices varied depending on the compound tested, with the poorest results for nitrate (r2 = 0.07) and the best results for phosphate (r2 = 0.89) when using the photometer. Seasonal nutrient concentration patterns differed between the years of moderate (2019) and low (2021) precipitation, but there was no correlation between rainfall amounts and nutrient concentrations, suggesting other drivers. This study identifies the strengths and weaknesses of cost-effective nutrient testing devices, guiding continuous monitoring efforts with communities.					; Bradford, Lori/AFB-8752-2022	Bradford, Lori/0000-0002-0926-2010; 														2073-4441				MAY 5	2025	17	9							1386	10.3390/w17091386	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17091386													WOS:001486003100001

However, the relationship between glacial presence and aeolian activity in this periglacial region remains poorly understood. To investigate this, three sediment sequences from a blowout in the periglacial region of HRYR were selected for sampling. The coarse-grained (CG) K-feldspar pIRIR dating was employed to establish the chronology, yielding 16 luminescence ages that ranged from 16.35 +/- 0.96 ka to 60 +/- 1 a. The results indicate that the earliest aeolian deposits occurred during the Last Deglaciation, with aeolian deposits also recorded in the early Holocene. During the mid-Holocene, there was a gap in aeolian sedimentation, which may be due to humid climatic conditions. In the late Holocene, drier and cooler climatic conditions triggered a resurgence of rapid aeolian deposition. A depositional gap between 2.5 and 0.6 ka in this period likely reflects erosional events under high wind energy conditions. Aeolian activity during the Last Deglaciation was closely linked to the periglacial environment at the sampling site. As the glaciers receded, the moraine deposits from the Bayan Har Mountains were reworked by rivers and exposed during the dry seasons, providing source material for the localized aeolian activity in the region. This study aims to provide the influence of periglacial environment on aeolian activity and establishes a framework for understanding aeolian deposition in high altitude glacial environments.					郭, 先生/NRA-7530-2025; Hu, Jingjing/O-1206-2019; ZHANG, JINGRAN/LZI-1054-2025														0031-0182	1872-616X				AUG 1	2025	671								112984	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112984		MAY 2025											WOS:001487717100001

From June to October 2023, phytoplankton communities in a high-salinity lake in Alar City, Xinjiang, were analyzed using standard survey methods for inland natural waters. Biodiversity indices were calculated, and redundancy analysis (RDA), Spearman's correlation analysis, and Mantel test were carried out to assess the functional community structure of phytoplankton and its environmental drivers. In total, 115 phytoplankton taxa belonging to seven phyla were identified. The densities ranged from 23.76 x 10(5) to 53.54 x 10(7) cells/L. Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta were the dominant phyla, accounting for 41.7% and 27.8% of the total taxa, respectively. The dominant species included Microcystis spp., Merismopedia sp., Cyclotella meneghiniana, and other algae. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that salinity, water temperature (WT), Na+, TDS, HCO3-, Cl-, and K+ were key environmental factors significantly influencing phytoplankton community structure. Mantel tests confirmed that salinity (SAL), TDS, DO, and major ions (K+, Na+, CO32-) served as key determinants of spatiotemporal phytoplankton community distribution (p < 0.05). RDA results indicated that WT, TDS, alkalinity (ALK), pH, salinity, and Na+ were the key factors driving seasonal variations in phytoplankton communities. Notably, decreasing salinity and ion concentrations stabilized the phytoplankton community structure, maintaining high-diversity indices. This highlights the positive impact of ecological restoration measures, such as fisheries-based alkalinity control and systematic environmental management, on the health of saline-alkaline lake ecosystems. These findings provide important insights for the sustainable development of saline-alkaline fisheries and the conservation of aquatic biodiversity in arid regions.

J	Piscia, R; Caroni, R; Manca, M				Piscia, Roberta; Caroni, Rossana; Manca, Marina			Zooplankton Standing Stock Biomass and Population Density: Data from Long-Term Studies Covering Changes in Trophy and Climate Impacts in a Deep Subalpine Lake (Lake Maggiore, Italy)	DATA												Lake Maggiore is a deep subalpine lake that has been well studied since the last century thanks to a monitoring program funded by the International Commission for the Protection of Italian-Swiss Waters. The monitoring program comprises both abiotic and biotic parameters, including zooplankton pelagic organisms. In this study, we present a dataset of 15,563 records of population densities and standing stock biomass for zooplankton pelagic taxa recorded over 43 years (1981-2023). The long-term dataset is valuable for tracing changes in trophic conditions experienced by the lake during the last century (eutrophication and its reversal) and the impact of global warming. Zooplankton samples (Crustacea and Rotifera Monogononta) were collected within 0-50 m depth by vertical hauls with an 80 mu m light plankton sampler. The sampling frequency was monthly, with the exception of the 2009-2012 period, which employed seasonal frequency. The estimation of zooplankton taxon abundance and of its standing stock biomass is crucial in order to quantify the flux of matter, energy, and pollutants up to the upper trophic levels of the food web. The dataset provided is also suitable for food web analysis because the zooplankton taxa have been classified according to their ecological roles (microphagous organisms; primary and secondary consumers).Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15082827Dataset License: CC-BY 4.0																				2306-5729				MAY 2	2025	10	5							66	10.3390/data10050066	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/data10050066													WOS:001496173500001

Identifying the major ion sources influencing the hydrochemistry of an important Asian tropical lake	LIMNOLOGY												Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines and third in Southeast Asia, is constantly challenged by anthropogenic activities. Hydrochemistry was investigated to understand its spatial and seasonal dynamics in terms of anthropogenic and natural influences. Water sampling campaigns were done during dry and wet seasons from the western, southern, and eastern parts of the bay representing residential and industrial areas, agricultural and residential areas, and agricultural area in the catchment, respectively. Sites include crucial waterbody spots such as important tributaries, i.e., rivers and lakeshores. Major ions, Cl-, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and NO3-, were analyzed. Using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and ion molar ratios assessments, water origin was traced using the major ions, land cover, and geological characteristics. In general, results showed that in terms of concentration the dominance of the ions is as follows: Cl- > Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ > NO3- whether wet or dry season. However, this varies when looking at the individual river. In terms of the total ion concentrations at each site, the highest contributors were the tributaries in the western part and the lakeshore in the southern part. In general, all the measured major ions are influenced by the anthropogenic origins mainly by built-up at the same time geogenic sources were identified, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+ are inclined to the Pliocene Quaternary volcanic area whereas Cl-, K+ and Na+ are associated from seawater discharges. In terms of tendencies, south and east bays showed vulnerability to both anthropogenic and magmatic influences. West bay showed the dominance of anthropogenic influence. The results presented the geogenic and anthropogenic origins of Laguna de Bay's hydrochemistry that can help in coming up with better management programs to improve the water quality.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2025	26	3					461	471		10.1007/s10201-025-00797-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-025-00797-6		MAY 2025											WOS:001480568000001

Seasonality, worker caste, and the interaction between island area and habitat type influence the thermal tolerance of ants on fragmented habitat islands	MARINE LIFE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Fragmentation can alter thermal conditions on the remaining patches, especially at habitat edges, but few studies have examined variations in thermal tolerance of species in fragmented habitats. Ants are sensitive to both habitat fragmentation and temperature changes, and are an ideal taxon for studying these impacts. Here, we focused on the dimorphic ant species Pheidole nodus in a fragmented habitat island system (Thousand island lake) in China. We assessed critical thermal maximum (CTmax), minimum (CTmin), and range (CTrange) temperatures for both minor (workers) and major workers (soldiers) of 2307 individuals from 117 edge and interior colonies across 9 islands during relatively hot and cold seasons. Using mixed-effect linear models, we explored the effects of island area, habitat type (edge vs. interior), season, and caste (worker vs. soldier) on CTmax, CTmin, and CTrange. We found temperatures were 1-3 degrees C higher in edge than interior sites in relatively hot season. Yet, only CTmax and CTrange in edge populations were higher than those of interior sites on smaller islands. CTmax was higher in relatively hot season and CTmin was lower in relatively cold season, indicating seasonal plasticity in thermal tolerance. Workers consistently had higher CTmax and lower CTmin than soldiers. These findings underscore the importance of seasonality, worker caste, and interactive effect between island area and habitat type in shaping thermal tolerance of a dominant dimorphic ant species on fragmented habitat islands. Our study provides a roadmap for integrating thermal biology into studies of how fragmentation impacts biodiversity.

This study examines the zooplankton communities in two Uruguayan connected reservoirs, Bonete and Baygorria, focusing on the impact of different water residence times. Upstream Bonete has a long retention time of 140 days, whereas Baygorria has a short retention time of 3 days. The investigation was conducted over 2019-2020, involving ten sampling events at three depths. Physical and chemical variables, including temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, chl-a, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and organic matter concentrations were measured. Zooplankton biomass and community structure were analyzed through Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Results indicated higher zooplankton biomass in Bonete, with significant seasonal and vertical variations linked to environmental factors. Temperature, chl-a concentration, and water residence time were identified as key determinants. The study highlights the role of water residence time in shaping zooplankton communities. The findings underscore the need for tailored management strategies to address the ecological dynamics of reservoirs.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2025	112								126249	10.1016/j.limno.2025.126249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2025.126249													WOS:001478541500001

Forestry, fire, and fur: factors influencing densities of endangered fishers (Pekania pennanti) in central British Columbia, Canada	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The isolated and endangered Columbian population of fishers (Pekania pennanti) is thought to be declining in central interior British Columbia, Canada, yet little is known about the distribution and abundance of the species in several regions. We conducted DNA-based mark-recapture surveys to estimate the density of fishers in 2 spatially distinct ecosystems where current data were lacking, and evaluated which factors best explained the distribution of fishers in each ecosystem. We found the density of fishers varied substantially between study areas, likely because of the level of trapping mortality during each survey season. The density of fishers in the Chilcotin study area west of Williams Lake was among the highest ever reported for the province (21.3 +/- 3.8 [SE] fishers/1,000 km2), whereas density in the Enterprise study area southeast of Williams Lake was among the lowest (8.9 +/- 2.7 fishers/1,000 km2). Density estimates for both study areas, however, were orders of magnitude lower than those reported for eastern North America and the western United States and thus are at levels worthy of concern. Forested stands with wet soil moisture regimes composed of older deciduous and spruce trees were most strongly related to higher densities in both study areas; these stands also were known to contain higher densities of the denning and resting structures fishers require to survive and reproduce. This study provided wildlife managers with a snapshot of the density of fishers in 2 areas of central interior British Columbia that will help refine the estimate for the endangered Columbian population. Additionally, this work suggests that reducing trapping mortality within the Columbian population of fishers and increasing the protection of high-value denning and resting habitats may both be necessary to promote the recovery of the species over the longer term.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				MAY	2025	89	4							e70010	10.1002/jwmg.70010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.70010													WOS:001510018500008

The influence of environmental parameters on the spawning migration have so far been barely researched. In the present study, this was investigated for the first time in an alpine stream, that is not influenced by hydropower. For this purpose, a temporary video monitoring system was installed in the L & uuml;tschine and the Weisse L & uuml;tschine in the Bernese Highlands in order to systematically investigate the spawning migration over an entire spawning period. The survey period of 169 days and nights lasted from 09.09.2022 to 24.02.2023. A total of 89 lake running brown trout movements were recorded. The population size of lake-run brown trout in the L & uuml;tschine-system during the 2022/23 spawning season was estimated at 60-120 spawners based on this survey. The main spawning season lasts from mid-October to the end of November. It was found that, in addition to discharge, water temperature and air pressure have the greatest influence on the migration. This is consistent with the findings from the residual water section of the Hasliaare [8], [10]. Furthermore, 91 % of movements were recorded at dusk or in the dark, which clearly shows that this fish species prefers to migrate at night.																			0043-0978	2192-8762				MAY	2025	115	5					34	41		10.1007/s35147-025-2510-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s35147-025-2510-5													WOS:001493170600008

However, these lakes are not homogeneous and have different environmental characteristics. In this work, the structure and both actual activity and predicted function of the prokaryotic communities inhabiting water and sediments of 15 Mediterranean inland saline shallow lakes have been studied. These lakes are grouped in categories according to their salinity, conservation statuses, and alterations, which determine the structuration of the prokaryotic communities and their carbon-related metabolisms. Each salinity category and conservation status showed characteristic prokaryotic taxa. The relative abundance of methanogenic archaea tended to increase along the salinity gradient, but this did not result in increased methane emissions. The relationship between metabolic rates and the predicted abundance of their marker genes depended on the type of metabolism. Archaea played a relevant role in the organization of interactions between community members and were markers of good conservation status. Water communities were shaped by the salinity gradient, conservation status, and seasonality, while sediment communities were mostly determined by the salinity gradient. This work highlights the importance of combining molecular studies with in situ metabolic measurements to better understand carbon fluxes in inland saline aquatic ecosystems.

This study examines the Saman Bird Sanctuary and Keetham Lake, both Ramsar sites, using advanced remote sensing for water occurrence, land use and land cover (LULC), and water quality assessments. Sentinel data, processed in cloud computing, enabled land-use classification, water boundary delineation, and seasonal water occurrence mapping. A combination of Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), OTSU threshold segmentation, and Canny edge detection provided precise seasonal water boundaries. Study utilized a combination of the MNDWI, OTSU threshold segmentation, and Canny edge detection methods. These approaches allowed for precise delineation of seasonal water boundaries. Sixteen water quality parameters including pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total hardness (TH), total alkalinity (TA), total dissolved solid (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), phosphates (PO4), nitrate (NO3), chloride (Cl-), fluoride (F-), carbon dioxide (CO2), silica (Si), iodine (I-), and chromium (Cr-) were analyzed and compared for both sites. Results showed significant LULC changes, particularly at Saman, with scrub forest, built-up areas, and agriculture increasing, while flooded vegetation and open water declined. Significant LULC changes were observed near Marsh wetland, where positive changes up to 42.17% were seen for built-up in surrounding regions, with an increase to 5.43 ha in 2021 from 3.14 ha in 2017. Positive change was observed for scrub forests up to 21.02%, with a rise of 2.18 ha. Vegetation in the marsh region, including seasonal grasses and hydrophytes, has shown an increase in extent up to 0.39 ha with a rise of 7.12%. Spatiotemporal water occurrence was analyzed across pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons using Sentinel-1 data. The study highlights the role of remote sensing and field-based water quality monitoring in understanding ecological shifts and anthropogenic pressures on wetlands. By integrating land-use changes and water quality analysis, this research provides critical information for planning and conservation efforts. It provides vital insights for conservation planning, advocating for continued monitoring and adaptive management to sustain these critical ecosystems.Practitioner Points Spatiotemporal surface water occurrence at two geographically different wetlands-lake and marsh wetland; LULC and its change analysis to evaluate the impact on wetlands and its surrounding environment-positive and negative changes; Boundary delineation to examine changes and identify low-lying areas during the pre- and post-monsoon; Comparative analysis of the water quality of two different wetlands; Insectivorous plant-Utricularia stellaris, was recorded from Northern India at the Saman Bird Sanctuary for the first time.

J	Nacakci, FM; Gülcü, S				Nacakci, Fatma Merve; Gulcu, Siileyman			Comparison of Scotch Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) Origins in terms of Photosynthetic Gas Exchange and Chemical Properties	BIORESOURCES												This study was conducted to address the urgent need for identifying drought-tolerant varieties of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scotch pine) in response to the increasing impact of global climate change on forest ecosystems. The aim was to evaluate the physiological and biochemical responses of Scotch pine provenances grown in the Lakes Region of TOrkiye in terms of photosynthetic gas exchange and selected stress-related chemical traits. Samples from different origins were analyzed to assess parameters such as adaptation to drought stress, water use efficiency, stomatal conductance, and photosynthesis rate. The data, obtained from long-term provenance trials established in 2000 in Aydo0mu (Isparta) and Kemer (Burdur), revealed how these traits vary depending on origin and site conditions. Among the provenances, cataclk, Akyazl, and Mesudiye displayed higher photosynthesis rates, stomatal conductance, and transpiration. Additionally, the accumulation of proline and hydrogen peroxide appeared to play a key role in drought adaptation, with cataclk and Akyazl showing better performance under arid conditions. The findings provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate Scotch pine provenances for afforestation in arid and semiarid environments and contribute to the development of climate-resilient forest management strategies.																			1930-2126					MAY	2025	20	2					4681	4700		10.15376/biores.20.2.4681-4700	http://dx.doi.org/10.15376/biores.20.2.4681-4700													WOS:001485448400019

Examining Chloride in an Agricultural Watershed Using a Chloride Balance Model	ENVIRONMENTAL & ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE												Elevated chloride levels in lakes, rivers, streams, and groundwater are a concern in many snowbelt states, particularly in urban areas where deicing and anti-icing salt are major sources of chloride pollution. In agricultural and mixed land use watersheds, other chloride sources such as fertilizer, water softening, manure, wastewater discharge, and industry may be more substantial sources of chloride pollution. A chloride budget was conducted for Sand Creek watershed, a chloride-impaired, agricultural watershed in southern Minnesota, with the purpose of developing a model for watersheds with limited data and characterizing important chloride sources in less urban settings. Annual chloride mass contributions were estimated for major point and nonpoint sources from June 2013 to May 2019, including wastewater treatment plants, industry, deicing salt, potash fertilizer, livestock, and septic systems using various permitting data, monitoring data, land use data, census data, and other records. The estimated annual chloride budget was used in conjunction with a water balance model to estimate monthly and annual loads and flow-weighted mean monthly concentrations. Results from the chloride balance model show good agreement with more detailed models for the watershed. Road salt, fertilizer use, wastewater treatment plant discharge, and manure application were estimated to be the largest chloride sources that impacted a number of creeks in the Sand Creek watershed. Results from the chloride balance model for the watershed suggest significant chloride retention in the watershed across seasons and that chloride loading in the stream is more sensitive to major runoff events than timing of application from individual sources.																			1078-7275	1558-9161				MAY	2025	31	2					101	117																WOS:001490422900002
J	Ren, YH; Wu, P				Ren, Yonghui; Wu, Peng			Complete threshold dynamics of a reaction-diffusion schistosomiasis model in different time-evolving domains	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS												The significance of river and lake regions in the propagation of schistosomiasis cannot be overlooked, as this disease is transmitted predominantly through water. In this paper, we focus on the complete dynamics of reaction-diffusion model for schistosomiasis, which accounts for domain that evolve over time. By employing theories of asymptotically autonomous and nonautonomous semiflows, we delineate the global dynamics of the system within domains that are fixed, asymptotically periodic, and bounded, with the dynamics being dictated by the basic reproduction number. Utilizing the sub-and supersolutions method alongside the comparison principle, we substantiate the threshold dynamics of the system in asymptotically unbounded domains. numerical simulation part, we explore the influence of the evolving domain on the schistosomiasis transmission by comparing the basic reproduction numbers across various domains. Our findings reveal that the asymptotic growth and periodic changes in the size of these areas are pivotal in the transmission of schistosomiasis, with the growth of the regional evolution ratio being particularly conducive to the spread of the disease. These insights suggest that it is imperative for prevention and control authorities to enhance their schistosomiasis countermeasures, especially during the rainy seasons when the risk of transmission is significantly increased.						wu, peng/0000-0002-1971-720X													0960-0779	1873-2887				AUG	2025	197								116478	10.1016/j.chaos.2025.116478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2025.116478		MAY 2025											WOS:001487150600001

Warming Increases Environmental DNA (eDNA) Removal Rates in Flowing Waters	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA												The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) for aquatic conservation is emerging, but its value is limited by our understanding of how environmental factors like temperature impact eDNA persistence. Although elevated temperatures are known to increase eDNA decay in lakes and ponds, no studies have experimentally explored the effect of temperature on eDNA fate in flowing waters where physical removal could obscure the effect of temperature on decay rates. We compared eDNA removal rates in n = 12 indoor, recirculating mesocosms under varying water temperatures (20 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 26 degrees C) and found that, for small eDNA particles (0.2-1.0 mu m), removal rates were higher at the warmest temperature (Tukey's post hoc, p <= 0.03) while removal rates were consistent across temperatures for larger eDNA particles (> 1.0 mu m, Tukey's, p > 0.05). Consequently, smaller eDNA particles were removed faster than larger particles at 26 degrees C and 23 degrees C (Tukey's, p < 0.001) compared to 20 degrees C (Tukey's, p = 0.01), resulting in an increase in the proportion of the eDNA sample made up of small particles with downstream transport for the two warmer temperatures (beta linear model, p < 0.001). This suggests eDNA removal in streams reflects a complex interplay between physical trapping and microbial degradation influenced by temperature. Consequently, differences in temperature between geographic locations, seasons, and climates could impact the fate and interpretation of eDNA, even in flowing waters where physical removal contributes substantially to eDNA fate.					; Pinto, Pedro/D-5628-2015; Bibby, Kyle/C-6189-2018; Bolster, Diogo/D-9667-2011; Egan, Scott/B-5017-2008	Brandao Dias Ferreira Pinto, Pedro/0000-0001-8583-0617; 													2637-4943					MAY	2025	7	3							e70094	10.1002/edn3.70094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/edn3.70094													WOS:001502775100001

The pollution levels and associated risks were evaluated using the methods of geoaccumulation index, single factor index, health risk model and potential ecological risk index. The results showed that As(V) dominated across all environmental matrices. TAs concentrations in water (1.36-3.90 mu g/L) were all below the threshold set by the World Health Organization (10 mu g/L). The average concentrations of As(V) and As(III) in water were 0.82 +/- 0.48 mu g/L and 0.28 +/- 0.31 mu g/L, respectively, while those in surface sediments were 7.30 +/- 2.58 mg/kg and 1.16 +/- 0.38 mg/kg. Laohu Wharf, the Dawen River inlet and the northern outlet area were identified as hot spots for elevated arsenic levels in water and surface sediments. In core sediments, the maximums were detected at a depth of 1-2 cm or 2-3 cm. As(V) and As(III) in water were significantly correlated with dissolved organic carbon, Chla, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and pH. As(V) in sediments were closely associated with oxidation-reduction potential, organic carbon and total nitrogen. Shellfish had significantly higher TAs and iAs levels compared to fish and shrimp. Collectively, shellfish and fish had been polluted with iAs. The average carcinogenic risks caused by iAs through daily intake of shellfish (3.72 x 10(-4)/a) exceeded the acceptable level (10(-4)/a). The TAs pollution in sediments was at a slight to moderate contamination level and posed a considerable ecological risk.

This study sought to close this knowledge gap by exposing the dynamics and relationship of windspeed and humidity in Uganda from 1980 to 2023 as well as predicting the future trends from 2025 to 2040. Using high-resolution gridded windspeed and relative humidity (RH) data for the past and seven downscaled and bias-adjusted global climate models within the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 framework under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), SPP245 and SSP585, we employed variability, trend, and correlational analyses to expose the wind-humidity nexus at a monthly scale. The results showed a domination of winds of the calm to gentle breeze category across the country, with a maximum magnitude of 6 knots centered over eastern Lake Victoria and eastern Uganda over the historical period. RH was characterized by high to very high magnitudes, except the northern tips of the country, where RH was low for the historical period. Seasonally, both windspeed and RH demonstrated modest variations, with June-July-August (JJA) and September-October-November (SON) having the highest magnitudes, respectively. Similarly, both variables are forecasted to have significant distribution and magnitude changes. For example, windspeeds will be dominated by decreasing trends, while RH will be dominated by increasing trends. Finally, the correlation analysis revealed a strong negative correlation between windspeeds and RH for both the past and future periods, except for the March-April-May (MAM) and September-October-November (SON) seasons, where positive correlations were observed. These findings have practical applications in agriculture, hydrology, thermal comfort, disaster management, and forecasting, especially in the northern, eastern, and Lake Victoria basin regions. The study recommends further finer-scale research at various atmospheric levels and for prolonged future periods and scenarios.

J	Chang, T; Li, MZ; Gao, X				Chang, Tao; Li, Mingzheng; Gao, Xin			Dispersal-based processes as drivers of fish communities and species distributions in the Yangtze River-Poyang Lake riverine floodplain of China	ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES												BackgroundThe assembly processes of fish communities in large complex ecosystems often exhibit spatiotemporal variation. In riverine floodplains, this variation is also influenced by interactions with the river main-stem during the flood pulse, which often masks and confounds the driving factor of community structure. Herein, we investigated the distribution patterns of fish communities along the landscape gradient in the Yangtze River-Poyang Lake riverine floodplain (YPF) of China, with the goal of understanding assembly processes that shape fish communities among different habitats and their possible linkage to hydrological disturbances.ResultsFish communities in the Yangtze River (YR), Yangtze River-channel ecotone (CYR), Poyang Lake-channel ecotone (CPL), and Poyang Lake (PL) exhibited significant spatial differentiation. Across different hydrological periods, channel ecotones act as buffer zones that can potentially provide stable habitats. For example, communities within channel ecotones (i.e., CYR and CPL) typically exhibited lower temporal variability than permanent lotic (YR) or lentic (PL) waters. Applying the newly proposed dispersal-niche continuum index (DNCI) framework, we quantified a profound dispersal effect among the fish communities across four habitats, especially during flood seasons when the river and lake channels were highly connected. Notably, the niche-related process was not prominent during low-flow conditions, which might be explained by the incomplete isolation of the PL and YR by the water channel.ConclusionsThe application of DNCI effectively quantified the driving mechanisms of YPF fish communities among different habitats across different hydrological conditions while visually representing lateral dispersal as the main driver of community distribution patterns. This study emphasizes the importance of the lateral hydrological connectivity of the riverine floodplain, which should be considered during conservation efforts aimed at restoring the natural river-lake network necessary for fish diversity to flourish.																				2192-1709				APR 27	2025	14	1							48	10.1186/s13717-025-00616-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-025-00616-x													WOS:001478250400001

Post-fire vegetation regeneration during abnormally dry years following severe montane fire: Southern Alberta, Canada	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Fire regimes across montane regions of western Canada are changing resulting in longer fire seasons, higher intensity fires, and shortening fire return intervals. The implications of high severity fire and warmer, drier early post-fire conditions on herbaceous understory vegetation regeneration and seedling recruitment in the southern Canadian Rockies are not well known. The overall objective of this study is to quantify trajectories of vegetation recovery (species, structural characteristics, and biomass) during early years of abnormally warm, dry conditions following a high severity fire in two moisture endmember sites Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada. Here, we compare the within and between year spatial and temporal variability of vegetation growth and species density and how these change over time and across the broader area as an indicator of ecosystem resilience within these endmember sites. Moderate to extreme drought occurred during the years following fire at Waterton, where 2021 was ranked as the 2nd driest year in 26 years. Despite this, the moist site was characterised by greater herbaceous vegetation recovery with few lodgepole pine seedlings (average biomass = 335 g m- 2), while a drier site had greater seedling recruitment over a period of 5 years. Variations in site environmental conditions were more impactful than differences between years (drought) on post-fire vegetation recovery. Use of remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) remotely sensed data provided an effective means for quantifying variability in regenerating vegetation height (structure from motion), cover (green chromatic coordinate), and biomass when compared at plot level (R2 = 0.53, 0.53, and 0.30 respectively) using optical photogrammetric methods. The research presented has implications for forest and fuel management in Canada as national parks and forest agencies consider historic use of heterogeneous species patches. High density of lodgepole pine seedling recruitment in mineral soils and under very dry conditions indicate resilience to drought. This will require continued and expanded monitoring as other tree species recruits populate the post-fire environment.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				JUL 1	2025	587								122750	10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122750	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122750		APR 2025											WOS:001491911200001

Surface water irrigation reservoirs improve groundwater recovery in a heavily stressed aquifer	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Expansion of irrigated cropland area in eastern Arkansas has led to the formation of regional cones of depression and creation of critical groundwater areas for the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer (MRVA) in Arkansas. In response, use of surface water reservoirs for irrigation in the Grand Prairie critical groundwater area (GPCGA) has been implemented toward improving groundwater recovery, but effects of this strategy are unclear. We leverage publicly available satellite imagery and geospatial computational resources to estimate in GPCGA: (1) total surface water area on cropland and non-cropland potentially used for irrigation using a supervised classification model and (2) causal effect of surface water area on groundwater depth-to-water measurements using a two-way fixed effects (FE) model. We show persistent surface water area can be accurately predicted with confusion matrix accuracy ranging from 97.1% to 98.7% compared with known surface water reservoirs. Causal effect of cropland surface water reservoirs on depth-to-groundwater shows an approximate 0.4 m or 3.3% decrease in mean depth-to-water measurements for a given growing season for watersheds with a 100 ha increase in surface water area. Greatest reductions in depth-to-water measurements occur in those watersheds overlying regional cones of depression, corroborating previous groundwater simulation experiments. We note that alternate specifications of FE model exhibited similar effects, indicating FE model robustness. While conversion of arable land to surface water reservoirs incurs economic impacts, surface water reservoirs present a viable groundwater conservation strategy and tool for groundwater resource recovery for MRVA and other heavily stressed aquifers.

In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations, characteristics, and sources of MPs in Nakivubo catchment, which drains waste and stormwater from Kampala city (Uganda) and empties it into Lake Victoria through the Nakivubo channel. Surface water samples (n = 117) were collected from thirteen sites in the Nakivubo catchment (S1 to S13) during the dry and wet seasons in 2022. The MPs were recovered by wet peroxide oxidation protocol, followed by salinity-based density separation, stereomicroscopy, and micro-attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. All the samples had MPs, with mean concentrations ranging from 1568.6 +/- 1473.8 particles/m(3) during the dry season to 2140.4 +/- 3670.1 particles/m(3) in the wet season. Nakivubo catchment discharges an estimated 293.957 million particles/day into Lake Victoria. A Two-Way ANOVA revealed significant interactive effects of seasons and sampling sites on MPs abundance (p < 0.05). Spatially, the highest mean concentrations of MPs (5466.67 +/- 6441.70 particles/m(3)) were in samples from site S3, which is characterized by poor solid waste and wastewater management practices. Filaments (79.7%) and fragments (17.9%) made of polyethylene (75.4%) and polyethylene/polypropylene co-polymer (16.0%) were the most common MPs. These are likely from single-use polyethylene and polypropylene packaging bags, water bottles, and filaments shed from textiles during washing. These results highlight the ubiquity of MPs in urban drainage systems feeding into Lake Victoria. To mitigate this pollution, urban authorities need to implement strict waste management policies to prevent plastic debris from entering drainage networks.

Management tools used broadly for annual white grub species, like seed- and soil-applied insecticides, are ineffective against or have not been evaluated specifically for M. formosae. Biological control, including entomopathogenic nematodes, is successful against M. formosae in turf systems. The goals of this study were to (i) isolate and identify nematode species from agricultural fields in northern Ohio with field histories of M. formosae, and (ii) evaluate their ability to infect M. formosae grubs in greenhouse and field trials.RESULTSWe isolated two naturally occurring entomopathogenic nematode species from the field, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema carpocapsae, in addition to a free-living Pristionchus sp. nematode. The entomopathogen communities sampled varied among field sites and were not correlated with soil physical properties or M. formosae. We confirmed that all three nematodes can infect and kill M. formosae grubs. In a greenhouse study, H. bacteriophora and H. bacteriophora + Pristionchus sp. killed significantly more grubs than the water control. In an outdoor microcosm study, nematodes successfully overwintered and subsequently killed M. formosae grubs at similar rates, regardless of treatment or inoculation rate.CONCLUSIONThese findings indicate that insect-killing nematodes are prevalent in corn-soybean systems with M. formosae and have the potential to be an effective tool for the management of M. formosae in field cropping systems in the Great Lakes region.

J	Mishra, J; Botlaguduru, VSV				Mishra, Jyoti; Botlaguduru, Venkata Sai Vamsi			Characterization of stormwater runoff in the powai region of Mumbai	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Urban stormwater runoff could be a significant non-point source of surface water pollution during India's monsoon season (June - September). This study aims to characterize the stormwater runoff in the Powai region of Mumbai and investigate interlinkages between precipitation characteristics and runoff quality. The levels of conventional water quality parameters (physical, chemical, microbiological) and emerging contaminants in the runoff were determined. Runoff samples were collected from various outfall locations (SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4 and SL5) which drain into the Powai Lake. Runoff sampling was conducted for ten storm events spread over the 2022 and 2023 monsoon seasons. Two outfall locations (SL4, SL5) convey runoff originating primarily from an institutional township, and have reported the lowest organic loads and fecal contamination. However, runoff within the township contains elevated levels of metals such as iron, lead and Aluminum. In addition, emerging contaminants such as phthalates, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products were detected in the runoff. The runoff outside the township (SL1, SL2, SL3) had low DO levels and highest mean concentrations of TSS, BOD, and oil and grease. The potential mixture of untreated sewage with runoff was identified as the probable cause for low DO, which was further substantiated by the high fecal coliform loads (1600 MPN/100 mL). The findings from this study identify runoff as one of the dominant causes of degrading water quality and will serve as a reference to further scientific efforts in quantifying the pollutant loads, and development of export coefficients for the Powai Lake watershed.

Developing hydrological indicators for successful habitat management of selected breeding sites of Gallinago media in Poland	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Hydrological conditions of habitats remain one of the key factors determining the occurrence, abundance, condition, successful foraging, and breeding success of a range of wetland bird species. Appropriate saturation of the topsoil, flooding recurrence, and groundwater levels assuring stability of peatland and riparian ecosystems remain critical indicators for habitat suitability and behavioral requirements for wetland biota. Hence, comprehensive and geographically distributed studies on relations between the occurrence of selected wetland bird species and defined hydrological indicators may allow for the formulation of specific target values that remain a key factor to successful habitat management. Based on the extensive automatic water levels monitoring, our research conducted a comprehensive hydrological evaluation on 16 breeding grounds of the Great Snipe Gallinago media located in the westernmost range of lowland populations in east Poland. Our field-research-oriented study over 3 years (2020-2022), was an attempt to find correlations between selected hydrological indicators and Great Snipe males number on the leks. We found that the multi-annual lowest groundwater level during breeding season best explained the abundance of Great Snipes males on the lek and was positively correlated with the number of males present on the lek. We did not find any correlations between changing saturations in habitats and changes in the abundance of males present on the lek over one particular lekking season. Our findings indicate, that management of the Great Snipe habitats, at least in its western-most range of lowland population, should be oriented at assuring high groundwater levels just before and during the lekking season (late April-mid-May), consistently throughout the years. We found that average groundwater levels could have described appropriate hydrological habitat conditions for examined Great Snipe habitats during the lekking season ranging from 0.04 m above the ground level (agl) to-0.43 m agl. We also revealed that the target depths to groundwater table in fens, drained peatlands and floodplains should be kept at the level of at least-0.2 m agl to sustain appropriate hydrological conditions to maintain large and stable leks. Provided results have the potential to become a goal in the Great Snipe habitat management, where drainage and agricultural abuse of habitats have been reported as a main threat to this species' resilience in the edges of its range in Europe.

This problem can be effectively addressed by green-gray-blue infrastructures system, which water transfer project and sponge city project are two key strategies, but have never been placed together as a system. Therefore, taking Dong-Sha Lake basin in Wuhan, China as an example, this research aims investigate the potential of green-gray-blue infrastructures system composed of water transfer project and sponge city project to improve urban lake water quality, in which their seasonal performance and efficiency are vatively discovered, and the annually efficient operation schemes are proposed. The SWMM model and MIKE model are utilized for simulation. The results indicate that the green-gray-blue solution can reduce the nitrogen (TN) concentration in urban lakes by 40 %-60 % annually, with water transfer project functioning dry season and sponge city project functioning in flood season; the inlet-outlet arrangement and diversion discharge are primary factors influencing the performance of water transfer with the closer distance to inlet outlet and the larger discharge contributing to the higher pollutants removal rate but perhaps less efficiency; green infrastructures (GIs) paving area is the main index of sponge city projects; when its portion reaches 50 the TN concentration in urban lakes can be reduced over 50 % annually. The research provides an excellent example of green-gray-blue system to address urban water quality issues, with a particular focus on the bination of water transfer and sponge city projects.					; ZHANG, Xiang/H-3158-2013	Zhang, Xiang/0000-0003-0965-7298; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY	2025	382								125379	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125379		APR 2025						40262264					WOS:001477770900001

We hypothesized that abundance would vary more between collection days than between hydrological periods, whereas richness and selection would vary more between hydrological periods than collection days. Ciliated protists were sampled during two distinct hydrological periods: a dry period in September 2018 and a rainy period in January 2019. Sampling was conducted 10 times during each period, with collections every 3 days over 30 days. Throughout the study, 84 morphospecies were recorded. The Prostomatida group dominated in both periods, contributing to 37.1 % of the total abundance in the dry season and 74 % in the rainy season. Other representative groups included Peritrichia (35.7 % in the dry season) and less abundant taxa such as Nassulida, Colpodea, and Cyrtophorida (8.5 % in the rainy season). Abundance varied significantly in the short term (i.e. between sampling days) and between hydrological periods (dry and rainy), with higher values during the rainy season (mean f SE: 1250 f 150 Ind.L 1) compared to the dry season (mean f SE: 850 f 120 Ind.L 1). Differences in richness were not significant between the hydrological periods. However, there was significant daily variation during the rainy season. Species composition differed only between hydrological periods, as predicted. This study shows that the hydrological regime significantly influences ciliate communities, with variations in richness, abundance, and composition occurring over short periods. Therefore, it is recommended that these organisms be analyzed continuously, across short intervals, and seasonally. This approach is necessary because their responses to environmental monitoring may vary depending on the sampling period, given their high sensitivity to environmental changes.

This study proposes a multi-objective planning model integrated with a fuzzy control algorithm to address the conflicting interests of stakeholders and dynamic hydrological complexities. First, a network flow model is established to capture the interconnected flow dynamics among the five Great Lakes, incorporating lake volume equations derived from paraboloid-shaped bed assumptions. Multi-objective optimization aims to maximize hydropower flow while minimizing water level fluctuations, solved via a hybrid Ford-Fulkerson and simulated annealing approach. A fuzzy controller is designed to regulate dam gate openings based on water level deviations and seasonal variations, ensuring stability within +/- 0.6096 m of target levels. Simulations demonstrate rapid convergence (T = 5 time units) and robustness under environmental disturbances, with sensitivity analysis confirming effectiveness in stable conditions (parameter >= 0.2). The results highlight the framework's capability to harmonize stakeholder needs and ecological sustainability, offering a scalable solution for large-scale hydrological systems.

Long-term hydrologic connectivity on the Australian dryland margins: Evidence from the Willandra Lakes World Heritage Area over the last 60 ky	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The semi-arid Australian continental inland is increasingly subject to climatic extremes such as drought and flooding. Combined with the exceptionally low topographic relief characteristic of this region, hydroclimatic extremes can have an enormous impact on the land surface. Nevertheless our understanding of dryland hydrologic connectivity and earth-surface response remains poorly understood and largely unquantified. Here we investigate the impact of past hydroclimate on the semi-arid Willandra Lakes over the last 60 ky, integrating sediment-based chronologies for filling and drying of multiple basins with water-flux modelling and reconstruction of palaeoclimate parameters. We quantify the threshold inflow volume required to fill the lake system to 2 km3. We establish that prior to 25 ka, permanent lakes persisted for protracted periods of time in response to increased catchment precipitation, consistent with regional geomorphic indicators for wetter conditions. By contrast, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) oversaw rapid couplets of lake filling and drying despite lower precipitation, temperature, and increasing evaporation. We propose that seasonal snow melt from the highland headwaters during this cold phase, coupled with increased effective runoff due to reduced vegetation cover, was responsible for the large quantities of water entering the system at this time.

Such lakes typically contain large numbers of algae for which the contribution to organic matter pollution has not been adequately clarified. This study focused on a high-altitude eutrophic lake (Caohai Lake) characterized by distinct rainy and dry seasons, in which the features of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the metabolic characteristics of microbial communities during two periods were deciphered. The results indicated that DOM characteristics at different locations were significantly influenced by water sources. Based on the optical parameters, all of the lake water showed autochthonous DOM origins, and the intensities were even higher during the rainy season. Further molecular structure analyses revealed a consistent predominance of highly unsaturated and phenolic substances in the lake, but an increase of 20.4 % in the abundance of aliphatic compounds at lake center during the rainy season compared to that during the dry season. The microbial community, primarily composed of the algae Microcystis aeruginosa, assimilated and transformed inorganic carbon into organic matter within the lake. The partial least squares path model identified that algal density and microbial diversity were the primary factors influencing DOM characteristics in the lake, whereas the impact of nutrients in the water was relatively minor. The work would provide novel theoretical and technical support for organic risk control and ecological remediation in eutrophic lakes.																			2211-9264					JUN	2025	88								104037	10.1016/j.algal.2025.104037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2025.104037		APR 2025											WOS:001472487500001

This study provides the first basin-wide assessment of MC contamination in fish muscle tissues from Lake Chaohu and its major tributaries during the ban's initial phase (2022-2023), with comparisons to pre-ban data. Using UHPLC-MS/MS, we quantified MC-LR and MC-RR in fish from four trophic levels (planktivorous, omnivorous, herbivorous, and carnivorous). Results revealed that MC-RR was the predominant variant, and planktivorous fish exhibited the highest MC levels, followed by omnivorous, herbivorous, and carnivorous species, reflecting dynamics of trophic transfer. Overall, fish MC concentrations were significantly lower during the ban compared to pre-ban levels, demonstrating positive initial effects. Seasonal analysis revealed higher MC levels in warmer seasons, but detectable MCs persisted during cold seasons, reflecting ongoing contamination. Spatially, while fish in the lake exhibited higher MC concentrations, contamination was also detected in riverine fish, highlighting the basin-wide spread. Despite a lower overall health risk from fish consumption relative to the pre-ban period, high consumption of planktivorous species, especially during warm seasons and in lake regions, may still pose potential health risks. Additionally, MCs likely pose ecological risks to fish populations. These findings provide a crucial baseline for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of the fishing ban and underscore the need for integrated watershed management to safeguard both ecological and public health.					xia, wulai/AFR-6838-2022; Xu, Wenli/OGM-8782-2025														0147-6513	1090-2414				MAY	2025	296								118185	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.118185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2025.118185		APR 2025						40222110					WOS:001470879400001

Mapping of MPs in different deposition zones in fresh water sediment is important to identify their potential sources, sink, and transport mechanism. In this study, MPs were analyzed in sediment samples from Arun, Tamor, and Koshi Rivers in eastern Nepal. A total of 78 samples from 26 sites were collected from three independent deposition regions i.e., recent deposition (R0), recent past deposition (R1), and past deposition (R2) during monsoon season in 2023. All samples were analyzed following standard methods involving drying, peroxidation, density separation, microscopic examination and chemical identification by FTIR. In all the river basins differences in MPs count, color, and morphology were observed in three deposition regions. In Koshi basin the MPs count ranged from 7016-8876 MPKg-1, 8396-10596 MPKg-1, and 9416-9816 MPKg-1 in R2, R1 and R0 regions, respectively. The mean abundance was found to be higher in downstream especially in Koshi River. The predominant shapes, sizes, and colors found in all three river basins were fragment (52.5 %), 20-100 mu m (58.86 %), and black (33.76 %). The particles were identified as polyamide, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polysulfone, nylon, and polyether ether ketone. The pollution risk assessment indicated minimal MPs contamination upstream and moderate contamination downstream. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) and land use and land cover change (LULC) data were utilized to identify the potential sources of MPs. Agricultural and anthropogenic sources were identified as major contributors to the MPs load. This study provides baseline data for MP concentrations and their potential sources in Arun, Tamor, and Koshi river sediments. These insights could be important for future MPs mitigation strategies.

This study analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of water areas, fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and land use types in Poyang Lake wetland across wet and dry seasons (1990-2022) using remote sensing technology. The results showed that the water area remained overall stable during the wet seasons but decreased significantly in the dry seasons (19.27 km2/a). FVC exhibited an overall increasing trend, with vegetation expanding from lake margins to central areas. The land use areas of shallow water, bare ground, and Phalaris arundinacea-Polygonum hydropiper (P. arundinacea-P. hydropiper) communities showed interannual fluctuating decreases, while other land use types areas increased. From 1990 to 2020, land use changes were mainly characterized by the transformation of shallow water into deep water and bare ground, other vegetation into Carex cinerascens (C. cinerascens) community and bare ground, bare ground into deep water, as well as P. arundinacea-P. hydropiper community to C. cinerascens community. Rising temperatures enhanced FVC in both seasons, stimulated the expansion of C. cinerascens community area and total vegetation area, and reduced the dry season water area. Decreasing accumulated precipitation exacerbated water area loss and the decline of P. arundinacea-P. hydropiper communities. These findings provide critical insights for wetland ecological conservation and sustainable management.					邓, 华堂/JJG-0096-2023															2072-4292				APR 11	2025	17	8							1370	10.3390/rs17081370	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17081370													WOS:001474720400001

Seasonal Stratification Drives Bioaccumulation of Pelagic Mercury Sources in Eutrophic Lakes	ACS ES&T WATER												Increased lake eutrophication, influenced by changing climate and land use, alters aquatic cycling and bioaccumulation of mercury (Hg). Additionally, seasonally dynamic lake circulation and plankton community composition can confound our ability to predict changes in biological Hg concentrations and sources. To assess temporal variation, we examined seasonal total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations and stable isotope values in seston, waters, sediments, and fish from two adjacent urban eutrophic lakes in Madison, Wisconsin. In Lake Monona, surface sediment THg concentrations were elevated due to comparably higher urbanization and historical industrial inputs, whereas Lake Mendota sediments had lower concentrations corresponding with largely agricultural and suburban surrounding watershed. Surface water THg and MeHg were similar between lakes and seasonally dynamic, but water profiles exhibited elevated concentrations in the meta- and hypolimnia, highlighting water column MeHg production. Seston MeHg concentrations were often highest at shoulder seasons, possibly owing to metalimnetic MeHg delivery, but also differences in biomass and water clarity. The Delta 199Hg and delta 202Hg values in seston were similar between lakes, despite differing sediment THg concentrations and isotope values, suggesting a shared bioaccumulated source of MeHg. Measurement of MeHg stable isotopes further elucidated that seston and fish predominantly bioaccumulated pelagic-sourced MeHg.					; Hurley, James/LNQ-7005-2024; Lepak, Ryan/AAB-5329-2020	Cushing, Samia/0009-0008-1072-229X; Peterson, Benjamin/0000-0001-5290-9142; Janssen, Sarah/0000-0003-4432-3154														2690-0637				APR 10	2025	5	5					2444	2454		10.1021/acsestwater.5c00028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.5c00028		APR 2025						40371376					WOS:001463406200001

To address these challenges and modernize regional water treatment facilities, this study developed a nanofiltration-based integrated water treatment process for treating raw water from Nansi Lake in southwestern Shandong Province to support the operation and upgrade of regional water treatment plants. Process applicability was optimized through bench-scale experiments, focusing on pollutant removal efficiency and the mitigation of bromate formation and membrane fouling. The optimal configuration, "Coagulation-Sedimentation-O3-Bioactivated Carbon Filter-Ultrafiltration" was identified as the most effective nanofiltration pretreatment mode. Pilot-scale evaluations under two seasonal conditions demonstrated the process's long-term stability, achieving complete removal of turbidity, color, and UV254, with DOM removal exceeding 90%, and sulfate and hardness removal efficiencies of 96% and 50%, respectively. The process incurred an estimated cost of 0.2118 $/m3, with cost savings of 25.5%- 37.3% achievable by adjusting the nanofiltration product water proportion according to raw water quality variations.

The ice thickness, water depth, and heavy metal content at different depths of the lake were measured during the freezing and thawing periods. Based on a large amount of measured lake heavy metal data, MATLAB 2022b software is used to model data fitting and optimization identification, and wavelet analysis and 24 h sliding average method are used for verification analysis to describe the variation process of heavy metal concentration in ice water with depth and time. The results show that during the freezing and thawing periods of lakes, the water level is constantly changing, but the heavy metal content in the water below the ice follows the same distribution with water depth. During the freezing process, the heavy metal content in the water increases with the increase in ice thickness. A new numerical model describing the spatiotemporal distribution of heavy metals under the ice during the freezing period of the lake was obtained through calculation. The overall trend of the simulated contour lines is consistent with the measured values and has a small error. This study provides a reference for predicting the changes in heavy metal content under the ice cover during the freezing period in cold and arid regions. The model can be used to simulate the content values of heavy metals at different depths and times.

We analyzed the possible relationship between mean for the growing season CHL and W over the period of solar cycles 20-24 (1969-2019), as well as the relationship between CHL in water and bottom sediments with W during the entire cycle 24 (2009-2019). A moderate tendency towards a decrease in CHL with increasing W was revealed for cycles 20 and 22, but for cycle 21 there was no correlation between them at all. A linear increase in CHL with increasing W was detected for cycle 23 and the most distinct for the cycle 24. A close relationship with high positive correlation coefficients equal to 0.74 and 0.70 have been established between W and CHL in water and bottom sediments during cycle 24. For sedimentary pigments, the degree of correlation with W depends on the type of bottom sediments. A reliable connection is typical for deep areas with a high rate of sludge accumulation; in areas with unfavorable conditions for sedimentation, such a relationship has not been identified. It is assumed that the increased correlation between CHL and solar activity in the cycle 24 compared to the previous cycles is due to the anomaly of this cycle, characterized by unprecedentedly low W values.

Transcriptomic signatures associated with developmental transitions in the gill of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS												The developmental transition from the larval to juvenile stage, represents one of the highest periods of mortality for many species of fish. Thus, understanding the factors that may influence susceptibility to environmental stressors at this vulnerable stage is likely to be important for predicting responses to environmental change. Here, we compared gill mRNA transcript abundance during this critical developmental transition in fish from two geographically distinct populations of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) that experience highly divergent thermal environments. Throughout the developmental transition from the larval to juvenile stage (30 to 60 days post-fertilization), the 'colder' northern population exhibited differential expression of approximately twice as many transcripts as compared to their 'warmer' southern counterparts. Transcriptional modifications that were conserved across both populations during the transition from the larva to juvenile stage were involved in histone methylation, protein binding, and apoptotic signaling associated with cell death and turnover. The northern population, specifically, had increased changes associated with GTPase signaling activation, cell surface proteins, mitochondrial and epithelial development which may have contributed to the larger magnitude of transcriptional change in this population, compared to their southern counterparts. Together these findings demonstrate the impacts of transcriptional shifts in the gill during development in lake sturgeon, as well as the potential for population-specific developmental processes.

J	Johnson, S				Johnson, Shelby			Transformational Flows in Anishinaabe Ecologies and Agokwe Futures	EUROPEAN ROMANTIC REVIEW												This essay intercedes in trans studies and global Romanticism by turning to Ozaawindib (Anishinaabe), who was an agokwe. Assigned male at birth but living as a woman in her community at Gaa-Miskwaawaakokaag or Leech Lake, Ozaawindib's agokwe personhood is routinely elided by American writers. I trace pathways through and beyond settler reports of Ozaawindib with the writings of another Anishinaabe figure, Bamewawagezhikaquay, also known as Jane Johnston Schoolcraft. I argue that Bamewawagezhikaquay's retellings of aadizookaanag, or sacred origin stories, rendered in "Origin of the Robin" and "Corn Story," index a mode of transformable embodiment that exists through lived responsibilities to local ecologies, which she often figures in the seasonal growth patterns of plants and in the fluid dynamics of waterways. I read her coordination of transformable embodiment and gendered responsibility to reread settler archives for agokwe roles that flicker into view and disrupt the smooth unfolding of a colonial epistemic norm. Ultimately, I contend that engaging with Anishinaabe transformable bodies and relational ecologies must revise our sense of what it means to write about Indigenous gender and sexuality when we turn to the literary archives of global Romanticism for trans lives.																			1050-9585	1740-4657				APR 3	2025	36	2			SI		301	318		10.1080/10509585.2025.2494348	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10509585.2025.2494348													WOS:001492797200007

The lack of continuous sedimentary archives and quantitative temperature proxies further complicates this issue, especially outside Eastern Africa. Here, we use data collected in Cameroon lakes to assess branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT)-based temperature proxies and examine potential confounding variables impacting temperature reconstructions. By analyzing GDGT distributions in soil watershed, water column, and surface sediment samples from a total of 11 Cameroon lakes, we could verify that the degree of methylation of brGDGTs (through the MBT ' 5Me) can serve as a reliable indicator for reconstructing mean annual air temperatures. Additionally, we could confirm that surface water conductivity represents a controlling factor for the brGDGT assemblage in surface sediments of crater lakes. Moreover, we provide the first reconstruction of Mid-to Late-Holocene GDGT-based air temperatures for a crater lake in Cameroon (Central Africa), revealing a temperature decrease of 2.5 degrees C over the last 7000 years, which agrees with recently published records for East Africa but exceeds current model predictions. These discrepancies highlight the need for additional studies to focus on this geographically underrepresented area.

We establish an easy-implementing and effective framework for densifying water level series using satellite virtual stations (VSs). Virtual station-derived water level models (VS-WLs) were established based on the empirical relationship between water level records from HYDROWEB or DAHITI and near-synchronous water area values derived from Sentinel-1 SAR images. All VS-WLs demonstrated good fit, with an average R2 of 0.7858, and the densified water levels had an average root-mean-square error of 1.23 m. For 63 % of the VSs, temporal coverage was extended to encompass the entire 2017-2022 period, increasing the coverage by an average factor of 1.47. Additionally, observation frequency increased by an average of 7.26 times across all VSs, and the seasonal amplitude of water level fluctuations improved by an average of 1.22 times. In general, rivers exhibit stronger water level fluctuations in the southeast than that in the northwest, corresponding to the climatic wet-to-dry transition conditions. The Salween River had the greatest water level fluctuations, averaging 17.34 m, followed by the Mekong River at 10.76 m and the Yangtze River at 10.32 m. Peak water levels varied across basins, but with the peak generally occurring in the wet season (from April to September). Snowmelt, rainfall runoff, and glacier melt are primary contributors to these fluctuations. Additionally, tributary inflows exacerbate river level fluctuations downstream, although these impacts can be moderated by terrain and human control.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2025	658								133214	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133214		APR 2025											WOS:001463071900001
J	Araujo, RB; Langeani, F				Araujo, Renato B.; Langeani, Francisco			Fish communities in seasonally isolated lagoons of the Upper Paraná River basin, Southeastern Brazil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Marginal lagoons are natural nurseries of commercially important fish species and preferential habitats for sedentary and small-sized fish species. The composition and abundance of fish communities in seasonally isolated lagoons of the Turvo River, qualitative and quantitative changes in the dry and rainy seasons, as well as their relationship with environmental factors, were investigated. The material was sampled in both seasons in six marginal lagoons. Ichthyofauna was studied through species richness, diversity, evenness, qualitative and quantitative similarities, and ecological associations between samples and species. A total of 7457 specimens, distributed among 52 species, 40 genera, 19 families, and five orders, were recorded. The most abundant species were Astyanax lacustris, Serrapinnus heterodon, Pterygoplichthys ambrosettii, Hyphessobrycon eques, and Moenkhausia intermedia. Fish communities showed remarkable seasonality with the highest values of species richness and abundance in the rainy season. In both seasons, higher species richness was found in environments with the largest area and amount of macrophyte species. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that water temperature and alkalinity were significantly associated with ichthyofauna structure. Despite adverse conditions in isolated seasonal lagoons, global fish diversity was high due to heterogeneous environmental conditions. These habitats must be considered priority areas for fish conservation and management.

Evaluation of Historical Dry and Wet Periods over Lake Kyoga Basin in Uganda	WATER												Rainfall datasets from the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA) for 1981-2017 and two reanalysis datasets (Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations data (CHIRPS) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data (TAMSAT) were used to compute drought and flood tendencies from 1981 to 2017. The cumulative departure index (CDI) and rainfall anomaly index (RAI) were computed to show drought and flood tendencies in the region. Meanwhile, dry days (DD) and wet days (WD) were computed based on the definition as a day of the season with rainfall amounts less than 1.0 mm and greater than 1.0 mm, respectively. The CDI graphics indicated below-average rainfall during 1981-1987 and relatively wetter conditions during 1989-1995 for all stations in the region. Generally, seasonal rainfall declined over the first 27 years but an increasing trend in both MAM (March-April-May) and SOND (September-October-November-December) was observed in most stations during 2006-2017. The highly variable seasonal rainfall in the region is expected to impact the livelihoods of the communities. This study recommends that the use of tailor-made weather and climate information for planning economic development programs such as agriculture will play a critical role in improving the livelihood of the communities in the region.

Mineral dust emissions from proglacial valleys of western Canada: Historical and future dynamics	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Proglacial valleys of the St. Elias Mountains in western Canada are major sources of historical mineral dust emissions, as evidenced through loess records, yet no estimates of contemporary emissions exist for this region. In these landscapes, dust emissions occur at the interface of glaciofluvial and aeolian processes, not only subject to large seasonal-annual variability but facing major near-future changes following rapid deglaciation. We present a camera-derived observational record of dust emission activity in the A'& aogon;y Ch & ugrave; (Yukon, Canada; 60.94 degrees N 138.63 degrees W) and adjacent proglacial valleys between 2016 and 2022, immediately following a major glacial drainage reorganisation. In the A'& aogon;y Ch & ugrave; valley, we observe between 57 and 99 days of dust activity per year. Using Landsat 5-8 and MODIS retrievals, long-term variability in water, snow cover and NDVI was constrained from 1984 to 2023. Across four proglacial valleys, we identify 77.6 km2 of erodible area (58% of watercourse area), prone to frequent transient meltwater inundation, exposure and potential deflation of glacigenic sediments. Significant variability in seasonal surface erodibility exists between valleys, made notable following the migration of sediment stores into adjacent valleys prone to prolonged snow cover. Ongoing glacier recession and warming climates are anticipated to yield a transient increase in erodible area, and likely dust emissions, in the region over the next several decades. The subsequent decline is anticipated with further deglaciation and the continuing paraglacial transition of proglacial landscapes. A conceptual model is presented to this effect. Understanding contemporary dust emission sources, emission activity and near-future changes in emission dynamics is critical to establish the role regional mineral dust emissions will occupy in local climatic forcing over the coming decades.																				1096-9837				APR	2025	50	5							e70069	10.1002/esp.70069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.70069													WOS:001478283000004

Evaluating the use of a freshwater protected area by northern pike (Esox lucius) in a large temperate lake system	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Freshwater fish populations, especially migratory species and those with larger home ranges, are declining worldwide as a result of numerous direct and indirect anthropogenic factors. Freshwater protected areas (FPAs) are an emerging conservation tool that could help mitigate freshwater biodiversity losses by offering areas within freshwater ecosystems that provide full protection to species and the critical habitats they rely on. Using acoustic telemetry, we evaluated the use of a shallow, heavily vegetated FPA by northern pike (Esox lucius; N = 29) in a large temperate lake system in Ontario, Canada from 2019 to 2021. Receivers were deployed within the FPA, in the waters adjacent to but outside of the FPA (the "boundary area"), and throughout the open-area lake basins further from the FPA. Telemetry data revealed that 46% of fish captured and released in the FPA departed and did not return (N = 6), while the remaining 54% exhibited fidelity (N = 7). Notably, northern pike spent a significant portion of time in the boundary area, potentially because it contains deeper waters (maximum 12 m) that may offer thermal refuge or transitional space for movements to the lake's deep main basin (max 95 m). Additionally, three northern pike that were captured and released in the lake's main basin were detected inside the boundary area; however, their use of the FPA was minimal. Our findings underscore the importance of considering habitat requirements and movement ecology of species to inform effective FPA design and identify opportunities to enhance conservation benefits provided by these areas for mobile species.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Bergman, Jordanna/0000-0002-5183-2996; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2025	87	2							54	10.1007/s00027-025-01182-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-025-01182-2													WOS:001459103800001

The region experiences extreme soil water-erosion among the greatest rates globally at 498 tons ha- 1 yr- 1 leading to large quantities of sediment accumulation in Lake Abaya. Study Focus: Surface runoff, soil water-erosion, and sediment loads in the region vary with agricultural seasons and rainfall intensities but are often poorly quantified in modeling studies. This study assessed these effects using the event-based physically based distributed open-source Limburg Soil Water Erosion Model (OpenLISEM), incorporating local field data and multi- sensor satellite data processed with machine learning techniques. New Hydrological Insights: During the fallow season, simulated surface runoff and total soil loss were 9.7 % and 47 % larger than the growing season and 0.9 % and 42 % larger than the harvest season, respectively. Compared to moderate intensity, an 87 % increase in high rainfall intensity increased surface runoff by 159 % and soil loss by 295 %, while a 45 % decrease in low rainfall intensity reduced surface runoff by 49 % and soil loss by 85 %. High rainfall intensity had a greater impact when combined with fallow season land cover, while effects were smallest when low rainfall intensity combined with growing season land cover. A calibrated model parameter set for a particular season resulted in deteriorated model performance when applied to other seasons. These findings offer insights on the importance of considering seasonal changes in land cover and rainfall intensity when developing soil and water conservation strategies.

Notable plant rarities of northern New York alvar landscapes	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Alvar landscapes occur in the glaciated region of New York where horizontally bedded limestones are covered by little or no soil. Major sites are found along the eastern end of Lake Ontario northwest of Watertown and underlain by the Black River Group limestones. They are naturally open landscapes with scant tree cover often restricted to bedrock crevices. New York alvars are home to state-rare elements, including seven natural plant communities and 57 rare plant species. Floristic assemblages are diverse and include several disjunct species with northern, southern and midwestern (prairie) affinities. The mosaic of distinctive plant communities is adapted to extreme environmental conditions including seasonal fluctuation in moisture and temperature, variable shallow soil depths, localized runoff patterns, and cryopedogenic processes. They are also subject to recurring human disturbances such as fuelwood and fence post cutting, accidental fires, and introduction of drought tolerant nonnative species. Combined, these factors support a surprisingly high biodiversity in alvar landscapes.																			1095-5674	1940-0616				APR-JUN	2025	152	2			SI		104	113		10.3159/TORREY-D-24-00042.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3159/TORREY-D-24-00042.1													WOS:001578025900001

A biaxial creepmeter was installed in early 2021 across a previously unmapped oblique-slip fault, measuring a combination of dip-slip and strike-slip, and providing the first evidence of creep events along the DSF. The creepmeter records predominantly normal faulting, at an average dip-slip creep rate of 22.2 mm/yr, among the highest in the world. This large rate is also evident with the similar to 30 cm of subsidence recorded between 2017 and 2019 using differential LiDAR data. The data reveal seasonally variable dip-slip on the fault with a maximum rate of similar to 0.5 mu m/hr starting in August/September and approaching zero (mm/yr) in April. The creepmeter also records sinistral slip with an average rate of 1.3 mm/yr, about half of the total rate that was observed for the western side of the basin. Small Baseline Subset analysis of InSAR data indicate up to 13 mm/yr of line-of-sight displacement across the inferred fault. GNSS and InSAR data reveal high subsidence rate within the basin, between the western inferred fault and the Lisan salt diapir at the east and mostly along the shores of the lake. Our results indicate that deformation within the Dead Sea basin is not solely controlled by active tectonics. The observed vertical deformation is modulated by the thermo-elastic response of sediments and variations in local conditions, such as sediment compaction and fluid-pressure changes.

Sunlight surveillance: a simplified approach for the monitoring of harmful ultraviolet radiation in freshwater ecosystems	BIOLOGY OPEN												Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has a range of strong effects on freshwater ecosystems, and changing UVR is implicated in global amphibian declines. The link between UVR and amphibian declines is not well understood, largely due to limited understanding of actual UVR exposure regimes in freshwater ecosystems. Logistical challenges in measuring aquatic UVR regimes in situ have impeded progress, including the design of cost-effective radiometric monitoring tools and the measurement of UVR at ecologically relevant scales. We designed novel underwater UVR loggers and deployed them in southeast Queensland creeks to log near-continuous underwater ultraviolet index (UVI) for 11 days across four sampling events within the peak amphibian breeding season. We compared these data with solar modelling, dosimetric and handheld radiometric techniques. The dataset (2616 h from 39 UV sensors) revealed a highly heterogenous daily UVR microenvironment that showed capacity for harmful UVI exposures at both sites. Traditional cumulative or periodic UVR monitoring approaches often missed these acute high UVR exposures. Fine scale UVR data logging was proven to be a cost-effective approach for monitoring the UVR microenvironment in freshwater systems. While no single method can be considered universally optimal, our results highlight the advantages of continuous in situ UV monitoring, particularly for capturing short-duration ultraviolet fluctuations relevant to aquatic organisms.

Storms, Sea Ice, and Microseismic Noise in Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Using 155 distributed seismic stations spanning Alaska and western Canada, we document how environmental factors like storms and sea ice influence microseismic noise. We examine power spectral densities of continuous seismic data and focus on secondary microseisms (5-10 s) and short period secondary microseisms (1-2 s) from 2018 to 2021. We cross-correlate the height of ocean waves across the region with the power spectral density time series. We find that the Gulf of Alaska is the dominant source of secondary microseisms in Alaska. The eastern Gulf, in particular, produces more energetic secondary microseisms despite, at times, lower overall wave amplitudes. We find that the short period secondary microseismic noise is produced in the coastal waters and attenuates quickly moving inland. We show that this band is heavily modulated by the influence of sea ice in the coastal ocean by comparing it with sea ice concentrations. We also document how these two microseismic bands vary seasonally and spatially as they respond to different environmental phenomena. We find that this seismic energy closely tracks the seasonal arrival and departure of sea ice in the coastal waters. We also compare the inter-annual variability of short period secondary microseisms in the northern Arctic from 2009 to 2023 with shorefast ice data. The findings of this study are crucial for monitoring global climate change through seismology.

The hydrological parameters of rivers alter as cascades develop, resulting in a new pattern within the plankton community. We sampled 27 sections of the Wujiang River's main stream over four seasons from 2022 to 2023 and analysis of plankton and environmental factors. The samples were microscopically examined and classified according to taxonomy and functional groups. To investigate the impact of environmental variables on the plankton community, the study analyzed plankton diversity (alpha and beta), redundancy analysis, the Mantel test, hierarchical segmentation analysis, and a benchmark random forest model. The results demonstrated that the plankton community structure exhibited a combination of river-type and lake-type characteristics in the main stream of the Wujiang River. River cascade dam development caused variance in plankton across and within reservoir areas, with lower reaches exhibiting increased plankton diversity. Elevation emerged as the primary factor influencing plankton diversity and richness, while dissolved oxygen is the main limiting factor for zooplankton and temperature impact succession of phytoplankton. Besides, the land-use-type data was used to discover the influence of cropland and impervious land on plankton. Overall, our study offers valuable insights into the significant effects of different human activities such as cropland, cascade dam and impervious land on the patterns of plankton. It helps to improve our understanding of the intricate relationship between human activities and the plankton community, also provides new ideas and directions for the ecological environment management of the Wujiang River.																				2351-9894				APR	2025	58								e03494	10.1016/j.gecco.2025.e03494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2025.e03494													WOS:001431559700001

Although microcystins are known as the most abundant cyanotoxins released during cyanobacterial blooms, the physiological role of these toxic secondary metabolites has not been fully resolved. Here, we show that microcystin production is important for toxic Microcystis to maintain carbon metabolism under long-term nitrogen starvation and subsequent recovery. Compared to carbon metabolism in the nonmicrocystin-producing strains, toxic Microcystis could accumulate more carbon reserves under nitrogen limitation, which is important for the survival of cells under stressful conditions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the genes involved in microcystin synthesis were significantly up-regulated at the initial recovery phase, indicating their essential role in strengthening glycogen catabolism and fueling recovery. Flow cytometry analysis showed that compared to nontoxic strains, microcystin-producing Microcystis exhibited a higher survival and recovery rate after prolonged nitrogen starvation, which is consistent with the dominance of these species at the early stage of cyanobacterial blooms. The close genetic traits between Microcystis strains suggest that the strategies observed here might be highly conserved. Our results imply that toxic Microcystis establishes a competitive advantage over nontoxic species and provides insights into the seasonal succession of natural Microcystis populations.					; shang, jinlong/KHX-2738-2024; Qiu, Guowei/KUC-6815-2024	Xu, Hai-Feng/0000-0003-2857-2628; 														1529-8817				APR	2025	61	2					379	392		10.1111/jpy.70009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.70009								40119875					WOS:001479577100001

In two of the sites and seasons, Cr concentrations exceeded the FAO-WHO limit of 2.3 mg<middle dot>kg-1 (from 2.49 to 4.82 mg<middle dot>kg-1). In all, 90% of producers used water from Lake Chapala to irrigate their crops, although most did not perform water quality analyses, despite 32% being aware that the water was contaminated. The results highlight the need to implement strategies to increase awareness of the quality of irrigation water, as well as the need for comprehensive public policies that combine technical assessments and producer perceptions to reduce the risks associated with the use of contaminated irrigation water to promote sustainable agricultural production.

J	Marteau, B; Sundell, J; Pesonen, R; Nummi, P				Marteau, Basile; Sundell, Janne; Pesonen, Roosa; Nummi, Petri			Duckling body mass increases with abundant aquatic invertebrates: Experimental approach	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												In Fennoscandia, waterbirds have declined over several decade, and this decline could be linked to problems in the breeding success and loss of foraging habitat provided by wetlands. Availability of aquatic invertebrates is crucially important for ducks during the breeding season, and especially for young ducklings. However, the relationship of invertebrate food resources on duckling growth and survival is not very well understood. In this research, we used imprinted mallard ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos, 1758) to study the effect of the availability of aquatic invertebrates on duckling growth. At hatch, ducklings were divided into two different groups and assigned to forage either on permanent (lakes) or temporary (ponds) wetlands. Each day, ducklings were brought to the study sites for four hours to forage. Ducklings were weighed before and after the foraging period. Aquatic invertebrates were sampled with activity (macroinvertebrates and zooplankton) and emergence traps (aquatic emerging insects). The ducklings gain more weight in temporary ponds, and this was associated with the availability of macroinvertebrates. Temporary ponds had higher aquatic macroinvertebrate abundance than the permanent lakes. However, no significant relationship was found between duckling weight and abundance of emerging insects or zooplankton. We highlight the crucial role of aquatic invertebrates in ducklings' mass gain and emphasize the importance of temporary wetlands during the brood rearing period for the breeding success of ducks.

Here, we investigated iron cycling in a dimictic lake, Gro ss es Heiliges Meer in northwest Germany, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, as well as in-situ and lab-based experiments. Bacterial community composition in the lake follows geochemical gradients and differs markedly between oxic and anoxic conditions. Potential iron-metabolizing bacteria were found mostly in anoxic conditions at 7 and 8 m depth and were comprised of taxa from the genera Chlorobium, Thiodictyon, Sideroxydans, Geobacter, and Rhodoferrax. We were able to recreate active iron cycling (1) with an ex-situ microbial community from 8 m depth and (2) with a successful microbial enrichment culture from 7 m depth. Varying the light and organic carbon availability in lab-based experiments showed that Fe(III) reduction overshadows Fe(II) oxidation leading to a cryptic iron cycle. Overall, we could demonstrate that microbial iron cycling can be a key biogeochemical process in dimictic lakes despite regular disturbance, and that complex environmental factors such as organic substrates control the balance between Fe(II) oxidation and Fe(III) reduction. High availability of carbon in seasonally stratified lakes hides the contribution of phototrophic bacteria in driving the oxidation of iron.

J	Reichhardt, B				Reichhardt, Bjoern			Mongolia's Mother Ocean Ecologies of Transformation at the Intersection of Land, Growth and Pollution	INNER ASIA												This article is concerned with ecologies of transformation, and it investigates how land, growth and pollution interrelate in northern Mongolia's Khovsgol Dalai watershed and Khatgal village. In an ecology where socio-ecological ruptures emerged from transformative processes such as infrastructural and industrial development, nature conservation, land privatisation and tourism, politics and human-environment relationships unfolded in ambiguous ways, leading to paradoxical modes of growth. As the only village in northern Mongolia's Khovsgol province, and marking the southern entrance to the Khovsgol Lake National Park (KLNP), Khatgal is a place where the past ten years of intense seasonal tourism have left their mark. I draw on long-term ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Khatgal and recent debates in environmental anthropology to show how varied imaginaries and realities of growth clash and conflate within a land-growth-pollution triad. I argue that land privatisation as a mostly positively envisioned framework for economic growth, security and progress within Mongolia's post-socialist transformation to neoliberal capitalism had significant social, political and ecological impacts on Khatgal. Under the precursor of nature conservation, Khatgal experienced a particular form of Mongolia's post-socialist transformation that not only resulted in the abstraction of the Khovsgol Dalai ecology, but also led to pollution and tense conviviality.																			1464-8172	2210-5018				APR	2025	27	1					139	165		10.1163/22105018-02701007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22105018-02701007													WOS:001483655500001
J	Shang, X; Chen, WB; Zhang, FQ				Shang, Xue; Chen, Wenbo; Zhang, Fuqing			Unveiling the Ecohydrological Pulse: A Dynamic Wind Wave Intensity Model for Poyang Lake Grasslands	ECOHYDROLOGY												The grassland of Poyang Lake is a typical landscape serving as a critical ecological zone where intricate wind-water interactions significantly influence local biodiversity. However, the energetic and temporal characteristics of wind waves and their driving paths are unknown. This study introduces a wind wave intensity (WWI) model to explore the dynamics of wind wave characteristics and analyses the temporal dynamics of WWI drivers such as water level (WL), water depth (WD), wind velocity (WV), wind orientation (WO) and wind orientation frequency (FQ), and WWI characteristic indices such as wave height (WVH), wavelength (WVL) and flushing distance (FLD) from 2018 to 2020, to reveal the response processes and mechanisms between them. The results are as follows: (1) Cyclical patterns were observed in the drivers, particularly highlighting seasonal variations in WO and FQ. The WWI exhibited a fluctuating pattern with a discernible oscillatory period, indicative of a sophisticated interplay among environmental factors. (2) It was found that WVH, WVL and FLD were predominantly influenced by WL, with negative modulation by WV, WO and FQ. At high WWI levels, a robust negative modulation by WV and WO preceded a highly significant positive modulation of WVH, WVL and FLD by WL. Conversely, at low WWI levels, FQ positively regulated WL, which in turn positively influenced wave characteristics. (3) The driving path model for WWI characteristics underscored the dual role of environmental factors in regulating the ecological landscape. The study's findings emphasize the intricate interplay between wind wave dynamics and landscape ecology, demonstrating how changes in WWI can affect grassland biodiversity through habitat alterations induced by variations in water levels and wave energy. It offers critical insights for forecasting and mitigating potential ecological impacts of wind wave processes, thereby enhancing biodiversity conservation and landscape management efforts in the Poyang Lake region.																			1936-0584	1936-0592				APR	2025	18	3							e70036	10.1002/eco.70036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.70036													WOS:001496228100009
J	Sharifi, FS; Hinkelmann, R; Hattermann, T; Kirillin, G				Sharifi, Fatemeh Sadat; Hinkelmann, Reinhard; Hattermann, Tore; Kirillin, Georgiy			Three-dimensional modeling of diffusion-gravity flows in ice-covered lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												When a solid inclined surface is submerged in a quiescent stratified fluid, the combined effects of buoyancy forces and diffusion generate an upward gravity flow along the slope. Thermally stratified ice-covered lakes remain in a nearly quiescent state and are potentially prone to this effect. We use three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling to investigate the diffusion-gravity flow and its impact on lake-wide circulation in idealized ice-covered lakes. The qualitative characteristics of the boundary flow were adequately simulated by the model, supported by a good agreement with theoretical predictions. In enclosed lakes, the modeled diffusion-driven boundary flow generates residual circulation, which overturns the entire lake water column within 1 to 6 months, suggesting a significant contribution of this mechanism to heat and mass transport in lakes with long ice-covered seasons. When the insulation boundary condition is lifted and additional buoyancy is produced by heat flux from lake sediment, a counterflow emerges, resulting in a circulation pattern characterized by the superposition of two opposing boundary flows. At flux magnitudes exceeding one watt per square meter, the counterflow can entirely replace the diffusion-driven circulation. Due to the small magnitudes of these flows, the Coriolis effect substantially influences circulation, partially transforming radial flow into rotational lake-wide "gyres." The number and rotational direction of these gyres depend on the relative contribution of bottom heat flux. The results provide a framework for designing field studies in real lakes and investigating circulation effects on the transport of dissolved matter, such as nutrients, oxygen and greenhouse gases in ice-covered lakes.					; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010	Sharifi, Fatemeh/0009-0006-4590-1322; 													1567-7419	1573-1510				APR	2025	25	2							16	10.1007/s10652-025-10026-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-025-10026-4													WOS:001436228100001

Physically stable yet biologically sensitive: multiyear ecological dynamics of anoxygenic phototrophs in stably redox-stratified Lake Cadagno	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake Cadagno is a meromictic alpine lake characterized by permanent stratification, which creates a permanent anoxic environment that supports the growth of anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria. The seasonality and interseasonality of these microorganisms were examined over a three-year period (2019-2021) through regular monitoring of the water column. A variety of physical-chemical parameters, including temperature, conductivity, light, oxygen and sulfide concentrations, and the community composition of anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria in the chemocline were recorded, to observe potential influence of external weather conditions. Our findings indicate that, despite the lake's consistent physical and chemical stratification, the composition of the anoxygenic phototrophic sulfur bacteria community exhibited notable variations in response to external environmental factors, including changes in rainfall and light irradiance. Specifically, we observed different growth dynamics in the purple (PSB) and green (GSB) sulfur bacteria communities over the three years of monitoring. These variations underscore the complexity of biogeochemical cycles in meromictic lakes and the impact of external environmental factors on this ancestral microbial community dynamics. The results provide valuable insights into the stability of redox-stratified environments, offering a modern analog for ancient aquatic ecosystems. This research emphasizes the importance of long-term regular monitoring to capture interannual dynamics and assess the implications of climate change on such unique ecosystems.

A total of 951 stomach contents were analysed, with prey items identified and counted. The Prominence Values (PV) for each prey type and the diet overlap (alpha) between the species were estimated.Both species shared similar food resources, with macrophytes constituting the primary component of their diets, particularly for S.erythrophthalmus (%PV=76.6). Arthropods were the second most important prey category for both species. Additionally, other prey categories, such as cyanobacteria, microalgae, and nematodes, were consumed in low proportions (%PV<1.5). Diet variations were observed among stations for S.rubilio and among seasons for S.erythrophthalmus. The diets of the two species showed significant over-lap (alpha>0.6). Both species were found to have narrow niche breadths, indicating specialized feeding habits. Sarmarutilus rubilio shows feeding plasticity, while S.erythrophthalmus is predominantly herbivorous. This information is valuable for developing future fishery management plans and strategies for fish biodiversity pres-ervation in Tunisian freshwater systems, especially since S.rubilio is categorized as a near-threatened species.

However, the scarcity of comparative CO2 flux studies between these periods in large plateau lakes of mid-latitude regions represents a significant gap in our knowledge. This study is the first to use an eddy covariance system to directly measure year-round CO2 flux (May 2018 to April 2019) at Lake Wuliangsuhai, the largest freshwater lake on the Inner Mongolia Plateau in the Yellow River Basin. Results indicated that Lake Wuliangsuhai was a CO2 sink throughout the observation period. During the ice-covered period, the lake absorbed significant amounts of CO2 (-0.82 f 0.26gCm- 2d- 1), about half the rate observed during the non-ice-covered period (-1.61 f 1.23gCm- 2d- 1). In the non-ice-covered period, the net CO2 exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (RECO) were -382.26 gCm- 2, -519.02 gCm- 2, and 146.98 gCm- 2, respectively. Significant diurnal variations were observed between the two periods. A "midday rest" phase, attributed to stomatal closure in emergent plants, characterized the non-ice-covered period. Carbon source activity was more intense during the non-ice-covered period, showing an unimodal pattern. Monthly, NEE and GPP followed a bimodal pattern. As the lake transitioned from the non-ice-covered to the ice-covered period, daytime meteorological factors influencing CO2 absorption decreased by nearly half, while nighttime driving forces increased substantially. Eutrophication reduced CO2 absorption during the non-ice-covered period but enhanced it during the ice-covered period, with CO2 flux changes showing a delayed response. Lake Wuliangsuhai demonstrated a stronger CO2 sink capacity than other lakes during both periods.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2025	658								133208	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133208		MAR 2025											WOS:001458407000001

However, current conservation efforts primarily focus on regulating mining intensity, often neglecting the long-term ecological consequences that may lead to unforeseen risks. Here, we integrated 20 years of remote sensing data on sand dredging activities with eight field surveys of the megafauna, Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) in Poyang Lake, to investigate the long-term impacts of sand mining. Our findings revealed that high-density sand mining creates numerous water-filled depressions during the dry season (equivalent to 153.5 % of the original lake area), which we refer to as sand traps. These activities exert dual impacts on porpoise populations: high-intensity dredging significantly limits porpoise distribution during active mining (p = 0.031); whereas the expansion of sand traps attracts porpoises after mining ceases (p = 0.0016). Within sand trap areas, untransported sediments accumulate to form sand reefs, leading to irregular water depth. Moreover, under extreme dry events, the expansion rate of sand reefs (<1 m water depths) within sand traps is 2.15 times higher than that outside them, further exacerbating the risk of megafauna stranding. In addition to controlling mining intensity, our study highlights the urgent need for mitigating long-term stranding risks from sand mining through ecological water level management, intensified patrolling, and targeted dredging, particularly amid the increasing frequency of extreme drought events.

The main aim of this study was to assess fluctuations (2016-2021) and to forecast GWT changes with a view to sustaining and protecting GDEs in a legally protected area that is subject to the strictest diverse nature protection regime (comprising strict, active and landscape protection) in the Wielkopolski National Park (WNP) in Western Poland. The study covers a river basin and two endorheic lake catchment areas. It relies on data from the meteorological and hydrological monitoring carried out in the park. To predict GWT changing patterns, a five-component hybrid model was applied: "Best ARIMA" model, "Exponential Smoothing with Drift", "Neural Network Autoregression", "Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using Loess" and furthermore "Trigonometric Seasonal, Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA Errors, Trend, and Seasonal Components". The GDEs typology was carried out in a source data matrix with a mesh size of 10 x 10 m using GIS techniques that rely on soil permeability, land cover and terrain as key water reception indicators. The hybrid model was found to increase the information potential of future GWT change patterns. Each method in hybrid model addressed different aspects of GWT dynamics, including seasonality, long-term trends, and random components, and their combination allowed to capture nonlinear and heterogeneous dependencies that single models often fail to address. The forecasts identified the predominant trend of steady GWT lowering (in the range of 0.02-0.29 m) subject to regular seasonality. Only two piezometers displayed a slight tendency of GWT rise (up to 0.29 m). A growing GW deficit in the WNP has been suggested by a downward trend that has continued since 2019, and by the prolonged persistence of GWT below the median. The projected GW deficiency was confirmed to contribute to GDEs degradation, also in strictly protected areas, its specific impacts varying depending on hydrogenic habitat type.

This study, using in situ measurements, satellite products, and the Weather Research and Forecasting with lake (WRF-Lake) simulations at Nam Co, TP, investigates under-ice thermodynamics and lake-atmosphere flux exchange by considering ice surface momentum roughness length (z0m), solar radiation transmission, and snowfall accumulation. The results indicate that default WRF-Lake simulations reproduce the seasonal variations of ice phenology dynamics and thermal evolution patterns but exhibit excessively slow under-ice warming, premature ice-off, and overestimated sublimation. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements suggest that the typical ice surface z0m value (1.65 x 10(-4)m) is approximately one order of magnitude lower than the default value (1 x 10(-3)m), causing weaker water warming, reduced sublimation, and earlier ice-off. Solar radiation transmission considerably enhances under-ice warming but also advances ice melt. Snowfall accumulation can significantly cool the lake, postpone the ice-off date, prolong the ice-covered period, and substantially reduce sublimation. The simulated under-ice thermal structure, ice phenology, and sublimation can be significantly improved by incorporating the above three thermodynamic processes simultaneously, reducing RMSEs for shallow water temperature and sublimation from 0.93 degrees C and 1.98 mm to 0.71 degrees C and 0.98 mm.

However, limited information is available on the variations in temperature extremes onset times. In this paper, we defined a set of evaluation indexes to quantify the onset times of temperature extremes. The spatiotemporal evolution of the onset times of temperature extremes in the Poyang Lake basin, China, was analyzed using daily temperature data from 87 meteorological stations in the area, covering the 1960-2022 period. The association between the onset times of temperature extremes and atmospheric circulations was further investigated in this study. We found that: (1) The onset times of all cold temperature events displayed a significant delaying trend (P < 0.01), while the onset times of all warm temperature events displayed a significant advancing trend (P < 0.05). (2) The variations in the onset times of temperature extremes were associated with atmospheric circulations. The Western Pacific Subtropical High-Intensity Index (WPSHI) and the Northern Hemisphere Subtropical High Area Index (NHSHAI) both correlated significantly negatively with the hot day onset date (SD30) (P < 0.01); the Arctic Oscillation (AO) showed significant positive and negative correlations with the frost onset date (SD0) (P < 0.05) and the warm season onset date (SD5) (P < 0.05), respectively. This study provides insights into the occurrence of extreme temperature events in the Poyang Lake basin, as well as useful references for implementing effective measures to reduce associated impacts.

However, glacial lakes are generally far from human and terrestrial influences due to their location so very few species can be identified and large changes in phytoplankton composition cannot be anticipated. Nonetheless, molecular techniques, as well as classical methods, help us to determine the existence of different species. Additionally, these techniques allow us to evaluate the ecology of glacial lakes from different perspectives with developing technology. Horseshoe Island is located in the area known as Marguerite Bay on the Peninsula region in western Antarctica. This study was carried out to determine phytoplankton genome biodiversity by using the metagenomic analysis method used in 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and 23S rRNA gene analyses. 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA gene analyses revealed that bacteria belong to broadly distributed Cyanobacteria taxa, whereas 18S rRNA gene analysis revealed other eukaryotic phytoplankton groups. This method was used for the first time for Horseshoe Island lakes (Col 1, Col 2, Skua, and Zano), and species belonging to Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, Ochrophyta, and Bacillariophyta were identified. As a result, the phytoplankton genomic diversity of shallow and oligotrophic glacial lakes was determined, and benthic algal species were also identified in the water samples. These results indicate that benthic algae associated with the sediment can also contribute to aquatic phytoplankton communities in addition to oligotrophic lake phytoplankton biodiversity. Cyanobacterial biodiversity can also be recognized as a sentinel by which to monitor adaptation responses to climate change in this rapidly warming region.

To understand fish community responses to these threats, we explored the links between functional diversity (FD) dynamics and environmental changes across four sites using trait-based methods and fish monitoring data for 347 species. We assessed functional richness (FRic) and divergence (FDiv) using standardized effect sizes to investigate the main assembly rules structuring fish communities and used generalized additive models to identify key environmental drivers. After dam construction, all four sites experienced significant changes in environmental conditions. Deterministic processes, particularly environmental filtering, dominated in structuring fish communities. The upstream Lao People's Democratic Republic site (LPB) influenced by deterministic and stochastic processes. The Cambodia sites in Stung Treng province (CST) and Tonle Sap (TLS) Lake primarily driven by deterministic process with a decline in FRic and FDiv. Conversely, the Viet Nam site (VCM) seemed primarily influenced by stochastic process with more subtle environmental effects, evidenced by an increase in FRic and FDiv over time. The upper sites (LPB, CST, and TLS) displayed a distinct seasonal pattern in FD indices, with values decreasing during the dry season and increasing during the wet season. Conversely, the lower site (VCM) exhibited the opposite. Water level emerged as the key driver across all sites, with temperature and total nitrogen as secondary drivers. Dam impacts and other anthropogenic factors not included in our analyses (e.g., unsustainable fishing and habitat degradation) probably contributed to the observed changes in FD at specific sites. These findings highlight potential strategies for conservation, offering national and regional practitioners an opportunity to develop and refine river management plans.

J	Chaturvedi, G; Avishek, K				Chaturvedi, Garima; Avishek, Kirti			Trend analysis of the indicators of urban wetland change and its implications using geospatial indices and statistical analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS												Darbhanga City is a major centre for producing fox nuts (Euryale ferox) and water chestnuts (Trapa bispinosa). The city had 300 lakes in 1964, reduced to 83 in 2023. There is a paucity of research on the urban wetlands of the area. The study attempts to bridge the research gap in the area by utilising geospatial indices to calculate NDVI, MNDWI, NDBI, EBBI NDMI, BSI, LULC, and LULCC detection to investigate the impact of land use change on the urban wetlands. Decadal analysis change was conducted using Landsat satellite data for 1989, 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2023, for two seasons: pre-and post-monsoon. EBBI showed better results for bare land area than BSI. Change detection was analysed for four major classes: built-up areas, urban plantations, water bodies, and barren land. The most significant change was observed for the built-up area, which increased from 21.3 % (1989) of the total land area to 59.8 % (2023). The other land use classes have decreased. The Kappa coefficient depicted an excellent overall accuracy of 89 %. The area under a water body in 1989 was 13.2 sq.km, which decreased to 4.2 sq.km in 2023. A common trend can be observed in pre-and post-monsoon results of MNDWI and NDMI. The results showed a positive increment of built-up area and a significant decline in the water body. This could result in a decrease in the production of foxnuts, impacting the livelihood of the local population as well as the water-related sustainability of the city.

Seasonal variations and health implications of indoor radon, radon and radium levels in soil in communities near Volta Lake in North Dayi District, Ghana	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS												This study investigates seasonal variations in indoor radon levels, radon and radium content in soils across communities near the Volta Lake in the North Dayi district, Ghana. Radon levels were measured using CR-39 detectors in dwellings, while soil samples were analysed for radium and radon exhalation. The indoor radon levels ranged from 24.6 to 244.1 Bq/m(3), with an average value of 125.8 +/- 7.8 Bq/m(3) (rainy season) and 109.8 +/- 7.4 Bq/m(3) (dry season), with higher concentrations recorded during the rainy season, possibly due to soil moisture trapping radon gas. Radium content in the soil ranged from 17.9 to 63.9 Bq/kg, with a mean of 39.2 +/- 1.6 Bq/kg, while radon exhalation rates ranged from 18.8 to 166.9 mu Bq/m(2)h with a mean of 102.9 +/- 7.7 mu Bq/m(2)h (rainy season) and 100.0 +/- 7.4 mu Bq/m(2)h (dry season). The annual effective dose from indoor radon exposure ranged from 0.9 to 5.7 mSv/y, with an average of 3.0 mSv/y, which is about 2.5 times greater than 1.2 mSv/y recommended by UNSCEAR. About 48 and 65% of the dwellings recorded radon values greater than 100 Bqm(-3) recommended by WHO during dry and rainy seasons, respectively. The mean indoor radon levels were approximately 3.2 and 2.8 times higher than the proposed world average value of 39 Bqm(-3) by UNSCEAR during rainy and dry seasons, respectively. The higher values recorded necessitate radon mitigation strategies in high-risk areas. This research provides valuable baseline data to guide public health policies and radon management efforts in Ghana.					; Amable, Dr. Anthony/KHU-1388-2024	Amable, Anthony Selorm Kwesi/0000-0002-2587-0534; 													2190-5444					MAR 25	2025	140	3							251	10.1140/epjp/s13360-025-06208-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-025-06208-0													WOS:001451858700001

There are no publications about the epidemiology of outdoor recreation injury and mortality in Texas. This work analyzes the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) outdoor injury reports to address this gap.Methods We analyzed TPWD injury incident reports filed from July 2012 to April 2021. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for continuous data, chi 2 analysis for categorical data, Fisher exact test for small sample cross tables, and two multivariable logistic regression models for the effects of season, activity, and location on morbidity and mortality.Results There were 4882 outdoor recreational events, including injuries (n = 4401, 90.1%), mortalities (n = 124, 2.5%), and search and rescue operations (n = 357, 6.4%). The injury and mortality rates were 5.20 and 0.15 per 100 000 visits, respectively. Activities preceding injury included hiking (n = 1112, 24.3%), walking/running (n = 1078, n = 23.6%), water sports (n = 533, 11.6%), biking (n = 393, 8.6%), and climbing (n = 260, 5.7%). The most common injuries were skin-related (n = 1194, 27.1%), musculoskeletal (n = 804, 18.3%), and heat injuries (n = 393, 8.9%). Activities preceding mortality included water sports (n = 52, 42.6%) and hiking (n = 20, 16.4%). Injuries contributing to mortality included respiratory events and drowning (n = 46, 37.41%), cardiac events (n = 13, 10.5%), and heat injury (n = 9, 7.3%). Most incidents occurred in Hill Country (n = 1170, 24.01%) and Prairies and Lakes (n = 1144, 23.48%) areas.Conclusion This study evaluates outdoor recreational injuries in the state of Texas. It uncovers and summarizes important trends that may inform the development of prevention and education efforts.																			1080-6032	1545-1534				JUN	2025	36	2					223	233		10.1177/10806032251323500	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10806032251323500		MAR 2025						40130498					WOS:001451448800001

However, its leakage to surrounding regions and the related impacts on water resource stability have never been studied under climate warming. This study attempts to meticulously examine the dynamics of groundwater leakage and its implications for terrestrial water storage (TWS) and groundwater stability from 2002 to 2022. A modified water balance approach by introducing the term of groundwater exchange, different from traditional equation for endorheic basin, was utilized to calculate groundwater leakage. The findings indicate that the average annual groundwater leakage amounts to 111.87 x 108 m3/year, with approximately 89.67 % of this leakage occurring during the warm season from May to October. The study identifies three critical thresholds of the difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) (P-ET = 17.39 mm, 33.74 mm, and 58.14 mm) necessary for maintaining TWS stability on an annual basis. Under conditions of climate warming, there is a notable increase in groundwater leakage, with an absolute rate of 0.83 mm/year, which is particularly pronounced during the cold season. Based on the average monthly variation of multi-year P-ET, TWS, air temperature, groundwater level and calculated groundwater leakage, it demonstrates that groundwater leakage is significantly influenced by frozen soil conditions, including both permafrost and seasonally frozen soil, which mediate the interactions between groundwater and surface water/soil water. Soil freezing during the cold season from November to April of next year, coupled with sufficient P-ET, plays a crucial role in facilitating groundwater recharge during the warm season. Additionally, according to the basic permafrost and soil properties and calculated changing rate of TWS, the northern edge of Great Lake Depression is identified as potential pathway for increased groundwater leakage. The study concludes that both TWS and groundwater are at considerable risk of decline. This research underscores the significance of groundwater leakage in the broader content of hydrological studies and practical water resource management, while also elucidating the effects of climate warming on groundwater dynamics and water resource stability in cold regions.					wang, mingxin/MCK-4735-2025														0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2025	657								133175	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.133175		MAR 2025											WOS:001457139900001

Temporal methane dynamics in the surface waters of a stratified eutrophic lake over four years	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The occurrence of oxic methane production (OMP) has been reported for numerous aquatic ecosystems. Its seasonal dynamics and contribution to global methane (CH4) emissions remains uncertain, however, due to the lack of measurements constraining the spatial and temporal variability of OMP. In this study, we used data collected over 4 yrs with three types of models to estimate the net production/consumption of CH4 (P-net) in the surface mixed layer of a eutrophic lake. These models allowed us to assess the lateral contribution and the surface fluxes' variability on P-net estimations. All model results show positive P-net rates suggesting that OMP occurs consistently during the stratified period and was often the dominant source of surface diffusive CH4 emissions. In years with monthly data, we observed a consistent pattern of high P-net rates at the start of stratification and a decrease towards the end of the stratified season. Along with the P-net trends and in agreement with recent findings, correlations between P-net vs. Secchi depth, chlorophyll a concentrations and light climate suggest that photoautotrophs play a role in CH4 production. Finally, using an isotopic mass balance model, we determined that the stable carbon isotopic signature of P-net in this lake was likely between parts per thousand-49 parts per thousand and parts per thousand-53 parts per thousand, which aligns with published work. Clearly, OMP can be a significant component of an aquatic CH4 budget of eutrophic systems, but can vary temporally; thus, temporal P-net variability should be considered when assessing the global contribution of OMP to aquatic CH4 emissions, particularly in systems experiencing or threatened by eutrophication.

The fossil mammals represent the Huayquerian SALMA within the late Miocene. We report for the first time a fossil bird fauna coming from central Argentina. The avifauna is composed of an indeterminate anatid, a new tadornine duck, a new palaelodid flamingo, a new grebe, a coot of the genus Fulica and an indeterminate heron and a recurvirostrid, which constitute a typical waterbird assemblage. This bird assemblage was found in beds interpreted as being a fluvial system with floodplains that represented an ephemeral lake ('Puchuzum lake'), exposed to seasonal droughts. It is possible that the Pliocene arid pulse that occurred in central Argentina may be regarded as a possible cause of the extinction of some members of the Puchuzum avifauna, particularly those of palaelodids.																			0891-2963	1029-2381				2025 MAR 24	2025										10.1080/08912963.2025.2475538	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08912963.2025.2475538		MAR 2025											WOS:001451690600001
J	Aydin, GB				Aydin, Gazel burcu			A comparative study on ecological risk assessment of some potentially toxic elements accumulation in surface sediment of stagnant and running water ecosystems in Meriç delta wetland, Turkish Thrace	JOURNAL OF THE SERBIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												This study determined arsenic, chromium, cadmium, copper, zinc, nickel and lead concentrations in the sediment of the lake and river and evaluated their ecological risk profile and compared the ecological risk profile of some potentially toxic elements accumulated in surface sediment of stagnant and running water ecosystems in the Meri & ccedil; Delta Wetland, Turkish Thrace which is located in the European part of Turkey and have two important river systems, Meri & ccedil; and Ergene, which provide freshwater resources for the region. Sediment samples were taken seasonally from three stations (one station from the river and two stations from the lake) in 2020. Ecological and biological risk analyses were calculated using the potential ecological risk index (RI), biological risk index (mERM-Qi), contamination factor (CF), contamination degree (CD) and pollution load index (PLI). As a result, although RI stated that Cd was determined as the riskiest element and mERM-Qi stated that Zn was determined as the riskiest element, indicated that there were no high ecological risks besides the investigated elements in the area. Although it is expected that the sediment quality of running water systems is better than that of stagnant water systems, the results of risk indices in the present study showed that the station selected for running water was the riskiest station in terms of potentially toxic elements.

However, studies on the role of sediments and microbial communities in the production and release of odor compounds remain limited. Seasonal monitoring of Lake Chaohu revealed that pore-terpenoids significantly contributed to terpenoid concentrations in water, explaining 37.1 % of their variability. Environmental factors like temperature primarily influenced terpenoid concentrations by regulating the diffusion of pore-terpenoids. Conversely, pore-nor-carotenoids explained only 11.2 % of nor-carotenoid variability, with phytoplankton communities explaining 59.4 %. Abiotic factors like nutrients influenced nor-carotenoid levels by impacting phytoplankton growth. Microbial communities with a greater proportion of cyanobacteria exhibited more fragile microbial networks, increased competition, and enhanced metabolic activity. We hypothesized that microbial community composition may influence odor production. Laboratory experiments further supported this: sediments with added cyanobacteria showed a 48.1 % reduction in 2-methylisoborneol contents after 30-day incubation, whereas the control group exhibited a 66.38 % increase. Conversely, the experimental group showed significant increases in (3-cyclocitral (99.19 %) and (3-ionone (48.55 %), while the control group experienced reductions of 54.01 % and 43.53 %, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of considering microbial interactions and sediment dynamics in future odor research, offering insights for water quality management in eutrophic lakes.

However, it is still a challenge to extract the natural shallow water area for inland lakes using satellite images due to their rapid changes and various human demands. Therefore, we developed a new remote sensing-based method applied in Hongze Lake (one of the largest freshwater lakes in China) to first delineate the lake from the SWIR1 band of Landsat OLI imagery using cold spots in the LISA method, and then distinguish deep and shallow water areas from the G band of Landsat OLI images using hot spots with LISA after masking the lake out, and finally extracting the natural shallow water area by masking aquatic farms out from shallow water areas using farm ridge classification from NDWI images and aggregating points of farm ridges. The results show that (1) the method of this study is efficient in extracting the natural shallow water area with limited effects from aquatic vegetation; (2) water inflow (upstream water supply and precipitation) and the area of aquatic farms, the two dominant factors for the temporal changes in natural shallow water area, contributed 38.3% (positively) and 42.2% (negatively) to the decrease in the natural shallow water area during 2013-2022 in Hongze Lake; (3) the natural shallow water area of Hongze Lake decreased significantly every April as paddy rice farms withdrew a large amount of irrigation water from Hongze Lake. Our research provides a new approach to extract the natural shallow water areas of inland lakes from satellite images and demonstrates that the upstream water supply, precipitation, and agriculture demands are the three main reasons for seasonal and temporal variations in natural shallow water areas for inland lakes.

However, insecticide resistance now threatens the continued efficacy of insecticides in malaria vector control. Monitoring insecticide resistance in mosquito populations is needed to guide the implementation of effective insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategies. Thus the study assessed the levels and intensity of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae (sensu lato) in five malaria epidemiological zones of Kenya, which are subjected to different vector control interventions. Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) mosquito larvae were sampled from Teso in Busia County in the lake malaria-endemic zone, Kwale in Kwale County in the coastal malaria-endemic zone, Kakuma in Turkana County, a malaria epidemic zone, Mwea in Kirinyaga County in the seasonal malaria transmission zone of Central Kenya and Thika in Kiambu County in the low-risk malaria zones. The mosquito larvae were reared into adults, and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) bottle DD intensity of resistance assays were conducted at 2x , 5x , and 10x the discriminating doses (DD); the WHO guidelines were used to evaluate the percentage knockdown or mortality of the adult vectors. Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes from all the malaria epidemiological zones showed resistance to deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl, while mosquitoes from most of the zones were resistant to alpha-cypermethrin. However, the mosquitoes were susceptible to the other insecticides tested, i.e. chlorfenapyr and clothianidin. In cases where resistance was found, the resistance intensity ranged from low to moderate levels. Anopheles arabiensis was the most prevalent species in all the sites except in Busia County, where An. gambiae (sensu stricto) was the majority. The results of this study showed widespread insecticide resistance in An. gambiae (s.l.) to commonly used insecticides in different malaria epidemiological zones in Kenya. Routine surveillance of insecticide resistance through monitoring and subsequent management in the zones of occurrence is a reliable component of evidence-based policy decision-making for mitigating malaria transmission using insecticide-based vector control interventions.					; Ochomo, Eric/JXN-2158-2024	KAMAU, LUNA/0000-0002-2186-0283; 													2667-114X						2025	7								100252	10.1016/j.crpvbd.2025.100252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crpvbd.2025.100252		MAR 2025						40206848					WOS:001453233400001

Anadromous salmonids, with their diverse migratory strategies and ecological traits, serve as an ideal model for studying dispersal evolution, showcasing significant inter- and intraspecific variation. Although environmental factors like temperature likely influence dispersal propensity, their effects remain poorly documented. This study compares dispersal patterns and population structure in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) along the subarctic coastline of James Bay, covering four degrees of latitude. These species differ in life history and population size, representing contrasting ends of a continuum influencing dispersal and gene flow. We hypothesised that lake whitefish, with shorter freshwater residency and potentially reduced olfactory imprinting, would disperse more frequently than brook charr. Using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, we found that lake whitefish exhibited broader-scale population structure and greater long-distance dispersal capacity than brook charr. Surprisingly, both species showed similar dispersal rates and population differentiation levels. However, lake whitefish had effective population sizes approximately 10 times larger than brook charr, indicating that while their dispersal is common, it results in lower effective gene flow. Moreover, dispersal rates in both species were lower in the northern study area, likely due to colder temperatures, delayed ice break and shorter growing seasons. These findings yield insights into how life history and environmental variation shape dispersal evolution in migratory species.																			0962-1083	1365-294X				MAY	2025	34	9								10.1111/mec.17739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.17739		MAR 2025						40108992					WOS:001447939600001
J	van der Zon, KAE; Schallenberg, M				van der Zon, Karina Anna Elisabeth; Schallenberg, Marc			Patterns of nutrient limitation of algal productivity from headwaters to estuary	INLAND WATERS												Studies of algal growth responses to nutrient availability at the catchment scale are sparse. Here we study algal nutrient responses in headwater streams, rivers, lakes, and an estuary in a temperate coastal catchment. Nutrient enhancement bioassays were used to determine phytoplankton and periphyton growth limitation by nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P) availability. In addition, we measured N and P concentrations and ratios in water. In the headwaters, algae were most often limited by N and N + P while algae further downstream became progressively less nutrient limited. Unlike other sites in the catchment, phytoplankton in a lowland headwater lake was almost always N limited, indicating that local characteristics shifted nutrient availability and limitation status towards P saturation. Nutrient limitation state could be correctly inferred from dissolved inorganic nitrogen:P ratios at only 4 of the 8 sites, highlighting the limited efficacy of nutrient ratios alone for inferring nutrient limitation status. Our results show that reduction of N and/or P concentrations to below growth-limiting thresholds could reduce algal productivity and biomass in the lower catchment, but not consistently, because nutrient limitation status varied greatly at sites within the catchment. Our study adds to the growing literature indicating that drivers of eutrophication can be spatially and temporally variable, even within a single catchment.																			2044-2041	2044-205X				DEC 31	2025	15	1								10.1080/20442041.2024.2442210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2024.2442210		MAR 2025											WOS:001447100400001
J	Gwiazda, R				Gwiazda, Robert			Impact of fish density and weight on breeding and foraging of two species of grebes differing in body size in carp ponds	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fish may significantly affect habitat use by birds. Ponds rearing different common carp Cyprinus carpio cohorts can offer different food resources for the larger Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus and the smaller Black-necked Grebe Podiceps nigricollis. However, carp ponds may be ecological traps for grebes. The numbers of nests and fledglings of the studied grebes were counted on fishponds in southern Poland during the breeding seasons in 2020-2023. The impact of pond surface, coverage by plants, mean fish weight, fish density and number of associated birds on the numbers of nests and fledglings of grebes was analyzed using a generalized linear model. Foraging success of randomly chosen adults feeding one young was studied on the selected ponds. Numbers of nests and fledglings of Great Crested Grebe increased with fish density. No factors were significant for the nesting success of this grebe. Fish density and mean fish weight did not significantly affect the number of nests of Black-necked Grebe. Although higher fish density did not affect the nesting success of larger grebe, it increased the foraging success of adults feeding young. Larger grebe was able to provide more food than smaller grebe in the same time.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2025	852	16					4107	4117		10.1007/s10750-025-05851-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-025-05851-z		MAR 2025											WOS:001448858800001
J	Nabavi, S; Mostafazadeh, R; Hir, RA				Nabavi, Seyedsaeid; Mostafazadeh, Raoof; Asiabi Hir, Roghayyeh			Temporal changes in river flow patterns influenced by regulating dams: insights from Colwell's indices	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												The temporal changes in river flow patterns are crucial for understanding how environmental, climatic, and human factors influence water availability and ecosystem health. The role of regulating dams in influencing river flow regimes is particularly significant, as dams can alter natural flow patterns, affecting downstream ecosystems and communities. The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of dam construction on temporal changes in river flow patterns in the permanent rivers of the Urmia Lake Watershed using Colwell's Indices (CIs). To achieve this, the daily flow data of the rivers have been utilized and Colwell's Indices (Predictability, Constancy, and Contingency) have been calculated and statistically compared using paired t-test at monthly and seasonal scales. Analysis of the daily flow data before and after the construction of the dam revealed a decrease in both the maximum and mean daily flow rates. The Band Urmia station experienced the most significant reduction in average flow after the construction of the Shahrchai dam, with a notable difference of 2.71 cm. Comparing the post-dam construction showed an increase in most of Colwell's Indices on a monthly and seasonal scales. The Predictability and Constancy indices showed an increase across all river gauge stations. Among the stations analyzed, the Yalghuz Aghaj station exhibited the most significant increase in Predictability and Constancy. Specifically, there was a remarkable increase in Predictability from 0.263 to 0.575, and in Constancy from 0.091 to 0.423. Furthermore, the Contingency index increased at almost all stations after dam construction. The paired t-test results showed significant increases in predictability and constancy post-dam, especially at Nazar Abad and Yalquz Aghaj. Predictability and constancy increased most at Yalquz Aghaj (mean difference 0.39, and 0.46 respectively, P < 0.000), and contingency showed modest changes. As a concluding remark, Colwell's Indices provide a means to measure and analyze various components of modified patterns of permanent river regimes. Therefore, it is crucial to make management decisions that consider the fluctuations in the river flow regime, with a specific focus on preserving the sustaining river flow. This study suggests a comprehensive analysis of dam impacts on flow indices, enhancing understanding of river hydrology and extending previous methods using Colwell's indices.

A Ramsar site catchment undergoing major land use/land cover change: Scenarios from elephant marsh, Malawi	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												Sustainable landscape planning in Ramsar site catchments requires data on the historical land use and land cover change (LULCC) and its drivers. Thus, this paper quantifies LULCC from 2002, 2011 and 2020 and its associated drivers. The Maximum Likelihood supervised classification was used to produce land use/land cover (LULC) categories for each year. The Bayesian hierarchical clustering approach (BHCA) and binary logistic regression (BLR) identified and ranked drivers. From 2002 to 2020, forest land exhibited a dramatic decline (25.83%/year) while bare/barren land increased noticeably (3.59%/year) during the same period. Other land use classes, such as marshes and water bodies declined at 8.23%/year and 2.64%/year, respectively. Shrub land, eroded land, irrigated land, cultivated land, and settlement increased at 1.76%/year, 1.15%/year, 1.72%/year, 1.9%/year, and 2.21%/year, suggesting that LULCC is indeed an emerging threat to the Elephant Marsh Ramsar site. Dynamic drivers such as browsing effects, forest fire, dry season farming, irrigation effects, deforestation, policy conflicts, weak governance systems, weak enforcement of registration, unplanned settlements, population growth, economic development, illiteracy levels, poverty levels and food insecurity had a coefficient mean score of >2.0 and were significant (P < 0.01), classifying them as higher risk. The coefficient mean scores for expansion of invasive species, charcoal production, infrastructure development, low household incomes, animal grazing, heat waves, drought, cyclone storms, unsustainable farming systems, lack of awareness, land tenure systems, brick making and sand mining, weak enforcement of registration, mining, water abstraction, strong winds and wetland vegetation-over-exploitation were <2.04 and significant at P <0.05, suggesting risky drivers. However, all drivers interacted with LULCC at multiple scales to produce complex feedback effects, influencing landscape management policies. These findings are critical, because they act as a baseline for managers and policy makers to prioritize integrated land-use planning to safeguard Ramsar site integrity, and account for future environmental and economic uncertainties.

J	Zobkova, M; Galakhina, N; Zobkov, M				Zobkova, Maria; Galakhina, Natalia; Zobkov, Mikhail			New method for identification of natural and anthropogenic organic matter in receiving waters of pulp and paper mill discharge	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Pulp and paper mills (PPMs) are one of the most water-intensive industries in the world. Where sulphite pulping is used to produce pulp for paper and other products, lignosulfonates (LSF) dominate the organic component of PPM wastewaters. Currently, there is no information about the quantitative composition of organic matter (OM) and contribution of LSF to the OM pool in lakes and rivers located within the zone of PPMs' influence. Addressing this gap in our understanding, a method was developed for the characterization of allochthonous (humic substances, HS) and anthropogenic (LSF) components of OM, and labile organic substances. The method is based on the extraction of HS from a water sample with DEAE-cellulose, introducing an experimentally determined adjustment coefficient for partial LSF sorption. The method was applied to the second largest freshwater lake in Europe, Lake Onego (also known as Onega), and its Kondopoga Bay, receiving wastewaters of Kondopoga PPM. The method's effectiveness was demonstrated through spatial segregation of the river and wastewaters in the bay in different seasons, first as a source of HS, and the second as a source of LSF. The vertical distribution of the river and wastewaters was indicated using conductivity, temperature, and TP. The proposed method demonstrated that HS in Kondopoga Bay make up on average 63% of the total OM pool and 17% of labile OM. However, LSF accounts for an average of 20% and up to 39% of the total OM pool, which confirms the high degree of anthropogenic impact on water quality of the bay.

J	An, N; Lopez, T; Antoine, R; Cui, YJ; Song, WK; Hu, HJ				An, Ni; Lopez, Teodolina; Antoine, Raphael; Cui, Yujun; Song, Weikang; Hu, Haijun			Effects of clay content distribution on soil hydrothermal responses in the Lake Chad region: Numerical investigation	JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING												Understanding water dynamics under the effect of climatic conditions is important to improve water sustainability over the medium- and long-term. Clay content can affect soil hydrothermal properties, and hence modify water and heat exchange between soil and atmosphere, e.g. evapotranspiration and infiltration. This work aims to develop a numerical approach to explore the influence of clay content on soil hydrothermal response to the timely climatic conditions in the Lake Chad region, Sahel Region of west-central Africa. The meteorological information at the studied points, i.e. points A and B with a clay content of 8.3% and 25%, during the year 2008 is collected from ERA5-Land hourly data. The numerical results allow for understanding the effect of clay content on the hydrothermal response of the surface soil layer. Specifically, the soil surface temperature under point A is lower than that under point B during the dry season due to the dominant effect of heat conduction. However, the converse tendency is observed during the wet season because of the combined effect of heat conduction and latent heat. The variations of soil volumetric water content are closely related to the timely interaction between the soil and atmosphere, in addition to the hydrothermal properties of soil. Moreover, the outcomes of this work improve the understanding of the heat and water dynamics under the effect of climatic conditions and clay content, and provide further insights into the potential water protection in arid and semi-arid regions in the future.

Climate warming has significantly degraded the YRSA ecological environment. However, owing to a lack of monitoring records, little is known about how freshwater lake ecosystems respond to climatic variability. In this study, we investigated the longterm hydroclimatic changes and diatom community evolution in Gyaring Lake, the second largest lake in the YRSA, by analyzing the total organic carbon (TOC), biogenic silica (BSi), authigenic carbonate delta 18O and fossil diatoms in a sedimentary core (ZLH2) that was radiocarbon-dated (14C). Our results indicated that the YRSA hydroclimate transformed from warm-dry conditions during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) to cold-wet during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The ensuing ecological effects include a shift in dominant diatom species from benthic to periphytic taxa, which may reflect an extension and diversification of micro-habitats. Despite the significant linear relationship between diatom biomass and hydroclimate over the past millennium, the response of diatom diversity to climate change appears to be more complex, showing a nonlinear relationship. The divergence in seasonal temperature records and alterations in habitat corresponded with the variations in diatom biomass and diversity, suggesting that the length of the growing season and habitat are crucial for freshwater ecosystem biodiversity in the YRSA. In summary, our research provides biostratigraphical evidence of the impact of climatic variability on lake biota and reveals a nonlinear pattern of freshwater ecosystem responses to climate on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).																			0277-3791	1873-457X				MAY 15	2025	356								109306	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109306		MAR 2025											WOS:001448088700001

Understanding trends and drivers of open surface water in the YZRB is crucial yet remains poorly investigated. This study proposes a new method to eliminate shadow impacts on water extraction, achieving 96% accuracy, and develops a long-term dataset from 1986 to 2022 using Landsat imagery on the Google Earth Engine platform. Trends in water area changes were analyzed for source region, typical river and lake dominated regions of YZRB, and partial least squares regression was used to attribute the major climatic and anthropogenic drivers of water change. The results show that water area generally increased by 39.88%, with divergent trends across regions. Source and river dominated regions both exhibited notable growths by 49.43% and 37.01%, respectively. Increases in the water area in the source region comes from both lakes and rivers, driven by increasing temperature and precipitation in permafrost regions, while increases in river dominated regions come from permanent water induced by construction of mega dams. Changes of the water body in lake dominated regions are mainly influenced by seasonal water and show varied trends. Poyang and Dongting lakes have decreasing water area, from 3354.24 to 2168.82 km2 and 1504.79 to 850.47 km2, respectively, which are both attributed to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir and alterations in precipitation patterns. While Tai Lake Basin experienced an increase from 1986 to 2003 due to expanded anthropogenic water bodies, it was followed by a decline after 2003 which was driven by urbanization. We therefore suggest systematically optimizing reservoir dispatching and land-water configurations to balance economic, societal, and environmental benefits.

J	Devi, NT; Devi, AS; Singh, KR				Devi, Naorem Twinkle; Devi, Angom Sarjubala; Singh, Khoiyangbam Raju			Impact of chemical fertilizer and composts application on growth and yield of rice in Northeast India	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Formulation of effective fertilizer management practice is crucial for sustainable rice cultivation. Prolonged application of chemical fertilizers can result in N loss into the environment, causing harmful effects. Application of organic fertilizer acts as an alternative source of nutrient supply for rice cultivation. The present study evaluates growth and productivity of rice due to sole application of three different types of composts, along with their combined application with chemical fertilizer. The three types of composts are compost made from organic component of municipal solid waste, vermicompost made from a combination of rice straw and cow manure and compost made from a floating mat found in Loktak Lake consisting of a heterogeneous mass of soil and aquatic macrophytes locally known as phumdi. Eight different kinds of treatments were maintained to determine growth and yield of a local rice variety (RCM-13), in field condition for two growing season in two years: (1) Control, no fertilizers applied (2) MSWC (Municipal solid waste compost, 100%) (3) VC (Vermicompost, 100%) (4) PC (Phumdi compost, 100%) (5) CF (Chemical fertilizer, 100%) (6) MSWC + CF (50%+50%) (7) VC + CF (50%+50%) (8) PC + CF (50%+50%) arranged in randomized block design. The combined application of phumdi compost and chemical fertilizer (50%+50%) produced 33.6% more grain yield and 26.21% more straw yield compared to 100% application of chemical fertilizer. Application of 50%+50% of municipal solid waste compost with chemical fertilizer and 50%+50% of vermicompost with chemical fertilizer were also able to produce more grain yield compared to sole application of chemical fertilizer, with an increase of 5% and 13.16% respectively. The finding indicates substituting 50% of chemical fertilizer with composts can enhance production of the present rice variety. Moreover, utilization of phumdi in the form of compost can also help in the management of the lake from further eutrophication.					; Khoiyangbam, R S/ABE-7358-2021	RS, Khoiyangbam/0000-0002-6508-8782; 													2045-2322					MAR 12	2025	15	1							8575	10.1038/s41598-025-93684-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-93684-0								40074877					WOS:001445749700001

Shallow lakes are more vulnerable to spatio-temporal variations, yet they are an important resource for biodiversity conservation, water supply and fisheries. The eastern arm of Lake Kyoga experiences two dry and two wet seasons annually, yet there is no information on how they affect its productivity. This study, therefore, focused on determining how spatio-temporal variations in temperature and precipitation influence production using chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as a proxy indicator parameter. Seventeen sampling sites were established for data collection during both dry and wet seasons. Fifteen physico-chemical and biological parameters like total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll-a were used for assessment. Thirteen of the 15 parameters had increased concentrations during the dry season, with only TSS and water temperature increasing during the wet season. Chlorophyll-a showed significant (p = 0.007) spatio-temporal variations between seasons. It significantly correlated with nitrate (r = 0.964), SRSi (r = 0.901), conductivity (r = 0.970) and pH (r = 0.936) during the dry season. Spatio-temporal variations influence nutrient dynamics, and therefore productivity in Lake Kyoga. These results are critical and should guide the water managers, decision, and policy-makers to develop appropriate mitigation approaches against impacts of spartio-temporal variations on the productivity of Lake Kyoga and its ecosystem.					; Mengistou, Seyoum/MVU-3709-2025; Odong, Robinson/AAX-4173-2020	Fetahi, Tadesse/0000-0002-7586-5354; 													1608-5914	1727-9364				JAN 2	2025	50	1					33	47		10.2989/16085914.2024.2406899	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2024.2406899		MAR 2025											WOS:001443418200001

However, under the combined pressures of shifting climate patterns and human activities, their responses to extreme events have become increasingly complex. As China's largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake supports critical water resources, ecological health, and climate adaptation efforts. Yet, the relationship between groundwater storage (GWS) and extreme hydrological events in this region remains insufficiently studied, hindering effective water management. This study investigates the GWS response to extreme events by downscaling Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and validating it with five years of observed daily groundwater levels. Using GRACE, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and ERA5 data, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-attention mechanism (A)-long short-term memory (LSTM) model was selected to downscale with high resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) and estimate recovery times for GWS to return to baseline. Our analysis revealed seasonal GWS fluctuations that are in phase with precipitation, evapotranspiration, and groundwater runoff. Recovery durations for extreme flood (2020) and drought (2022) events ranged from 0.8 to 3.1 months and 0.2 to 4.8 months, respectively. A strong correlation was observed between groundwater and meteorological droughts, while the correlation with agricultural drought was significantly weaker. These results indicate that precipitation and groundwater runoff are more sensitive to extreme events than evapotranspiration in influencing GWS changes. These findings highlight the significant sensitivity of precipitation and runoff to GWS, despite improved management efforts.					; Li, Zhibin/LMP-9841-2024; Wu, Chengcheng/JWP-0706-2024	Hannan, Muhammad/0009-0008-3523-9835; 														2072-4292				MAR 12	2025	17	6							988	10.3390/rs17060988	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17060988													WOS:001452368900001

They are important sea areas for Japanese fishery production. Observational results off Cape Notoro, eastern Hokkaido, over the last 10 years (2011-2022), showed that the influence of the Tsushima Warm Current Water (TWCW), the origin of the SWCW, has become stronger. The TWCW is dominated by small phytoplankton. An increase in their impact will have a similar effect on the ecosystem in the SWCW, where large phytoplankton dominate, as the shift to small phytoplankton occurs owing to global warming. Although the change in small phytoplankton observed in the current study was not statistically significant, the standing stock of small phytoplankton has been high over the past few years. An increase in the influence of the TWCW and a shift to small phytoplankton were observed in Saroma-ko Lagoon (2009-2022), the largest brackish-water lake in eastern Hokkaido. Data from the past 35 years (1987-2021) indicated a significant increase in the surface water temperature. Furthermore, off Shibetsu in the Nemuro Strait on the east side of the Okhotsk Sea across the Shiretoko Peninsula (2009-2022), the influence of the TWCW strengthened and indications of a shift to small phytoplankton were found. This study showed that in the phytoplankton community, the significance of small phytoplankton as primary producers has risen in response to environmental changes such as global warming and the growing inflow of the TWCW, in the coastal areas of eastern Hokkaido in the Okhotsk Sea. There have been concerns regarding future changes in the ecosystems and fishery production. Therefore, it is essential to continue monitoring studies for sustainable fishery production.																			0924-7963	1879-1573				MAY	2025	249								104052	10.1016/j.jmarsys.2025.104052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2025.104052		MAR 2025											WOS:001445250900001
J	Popova, A				Popova, Anastasia			Improving the Accuracy of Tree Species Mapping by Sentinel-2 Images Using Auxiliary Data-A Case Study of Slyudyanskoye Forestry Area near Lake Baikal	FORESTS												Timely and accurate information on forest composition is crucial for ecosystem conservation and management tasks. Information regarding the distribution and extent of forested areas can be derived through the classification of satellite imagery. However, optical data alone are often insufficient to achieve the required accuracy due to the similarity in spectral characteristics among tree species, particularly in mountainous regions. One approach to improving the accuracy of forest classification is the integration of auxiliary environmental data. This paper presents the results of research conducted in the Slyudyanskoye Forestry area in the Irkutsk Region. A dataset comprising 101 variables was collected, including Sentinel-2 bands, vegetation indices, and climatic, soil, and topographic data, as well as forest canopy height. The classification was performed using the Random Forest machine learning method. The results demonstrated that auxiliary environmental data significantly improved the performance of the tree species classification model, with the overall accuracy increasing from 49.59% (using only Sentinel-2 bands) to 80.69% (combining spectral data with auxiliary variables). The most significant improvement in accuracy was achieved through the incorporation of climatic and soil features. The most important variables were the shortwave infrared band B11, forest canopy height, the length of the growing season, and the number of days with snow cover.

Meta-analysis of a megafish: assessing patterns and predictors of Alligator Gar movement across multiple populations	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												BackgroundFreshwater megafishes are among some of the most commercially and ecologically important aquatic organisms yet are disproportionately threatened with range and population reduction. Anthropogenic alterations of rivers influencing migrations are among the most significant causes for these declines. However, migratory fishes do not always respond similarly to movement barriers and thus it is necessary to develop models to predict movements of freshwater migratory fishes in the face of anthropogenic alteration. Predicting movement of freshwater fishes is often investigated using statistical packages. However, empirical studies assessing these packages have led to mixed results, questioning its applicability to all taxa. We argue that spatial, temporal, and environmental attributes are more influential for movement of a migratory megafish, the Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula), than the current parameters explored in a globally relevant fish movement model.MethodsThis study explored two independent mobile telemetry datasets investigating Alligator Gar movement on the Brazos and Trinity rivers. Environmental associations were investigated to predict Alligator Gar displacement and dispersal using generalized additive models, generalized linear models, and model selection. Leptokurtosis of Alligator Gar populations was also assessed. Predictability of the movement model was tested by comparing observed to model derived stationary and mobile components making up a leptokurtic movement distribution.ResultsOur study suggests that current and antecedent measures of discharge and water temperature are positively correlated with Alligator Gar displacement and dispersal. However, these patterns are only detectable when monthly relocation intervals are explored rather than seasonal scales. Leptokurtosis was observed in both Alligator Gar populations. However, movement was normally distributed (i.e., mesokurtic) under tracking events following high flood pulses. Additionally, predicted Alligator Gar movement was significantly farther under modeled values compared to observed values, in part because the species undergoes cyclical migrations for reproduction that are sensitive to water temperature and discharge.DiscussionIn conclusion, this study provides an alternative framework to assess the movement patterns of migratory fishes, which could be tested on additional freshwater fishes, and suggests that assessing spatial, environmental, and temporal processes simultaneously are necessary to capture the complexities of fish movement which currently are unavailable for the movement model we investigated.

Indigenous owned aquatic monitoring programs in the Inuvialuit settlement region work: an adaptive framework with example traditional and local knowledge quotes and coastal marine water quality data collected from 2019 to 2022 near Sachs Harbour and Ulukhaktok	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Canadian Arctic residents are experiencing longer open water seasons and observing significant change in aquatic species and habitats. Rapid ecosystem change threatens Inuit people's food security and adds to existing generational trauma caused by ongoing colonialism and industrialization. Indigenous owned environmental monitoring programs prioritize safety, support community empowerment, and self-determination to increase the understanding of and resilience to the impacts of this human caused global climate crisis. To this end, in 2019 local expert fishers and hunters from the Inuvialuit Settlement Region worked collaboratively with an independent research scientist to start up community owned aquatic monitoring and observation (AMO) programs in Sachs Harbour and Ulukhaktok in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. The field teams received training to collect year-round data of lake and coastal water quality data using scientific instruments that measure water temperature, conductivity/salinity, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen with depth from the surface down to 150 m. ROV's, drones, and hydrophones extend observations and traditional and local knowledge directs the programs. External clients can hire the teams to augment core funding. AMO teams are finalizing their program and data ownership protocols, which are informed by the Canadian UNDRIP Act and OCAP (R) principles. Indigenous owned, directed, and operated environmental monitoring programs justly deserve funding priority and ongoing public support to help conserve and protect critical areas for future generations.																				2368-7460				MAR	2025	11								0005	10.1139/as-2024-0005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2024-0005													WOS:001447530800001

The purpose of this study was to investigate upstream municipal and industrial pollution impacts on irrigated farming and ecosystem health. The suitability indices and Heavy Metal Pollution Index methods have been used to identify the contamination extent and corresponding spatial and seasonal variability. Samples were collected twice per annum, i.e., during the low-flow season and high-flow season (rainy season) in the 2022/23 year. Results showed that during the low-flow season, the salinity hazard was 0.7 dS/m to 2.5 dS/m and medium to high. Sodicity hazards were obtained below <10 for the low-flow season, and for the rainy season, medium (16.63), high (18-26), and very high (>26). The toxic level of chloride for low-flow season showed slight to moderate at 3.6 mg/L and 6.07 mg/L, and toxicity was severe at Deho (14.6 mg/L), slight to moderate at Ambash (4 mg/L), Ertaale Lake (5 mg/L), and Gewanie (4.6 mg/L) in high-flow seasons. No heavy metal contamination was observed for low-flow periods except at Werer Research, which had a Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) > 100. But, during the rainy season, Kesem Dam, Sedi Weir, WARC Pumping, WARC Offtake, and Ambash had a HPI > 100, which implied contamination by metals. Cadmium (Cd) was at moderate to ecological risk at low flow in sites Kesem factory, WARC Offtake, Ertaale, Meteka, and Gewanie, whereas Sedi Weir (Cd and Hg) and WARC Offtake (Cd) were at moderate risk during high flow. To conclude, metal pollution is a serious concern that needs upstream quality monitoring.

Then, eight weather types in the range of hot weather types without rain to cool and very cold weather types with low cloudiness and no precipitation showed an occurrence frequency of more than 61%. The highest number of weather types with 45 types in the cold season and 26 types in the hot season was determined in Tabriz and Urmia, respectively. Then, modified Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator tests were used to determine the changing trend of the weather types. Investigations showed that, the hot weather type without precipitation and the slightly cool weather type without precipitation and of course without clouds had an increasing trend respectively, and the cold types also showed a decreasing trend in favor of cool types. The intensity of these changes is much greater in Tabriz. using the MMK test, it was also determined that the increasing trend of hot weather in Tabriz started in 2000 at the same time as the lake began to dry up.																			2040-2244	2408-9354				MAR	2025	16	3					819	836		10.2166/wcc.2025.356	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2025.356													WOS:001456323300001

The results show significant variations in vegetation composition across different watersheds, leading to notable differences in both the percentage and concentration of pollen types. Pollen concentration in river water is generally higher in the mainstream compared to tributaries, while sediment pollen percentage and concentration are typically lower in the mainstream than in tributaries. The concentration of suspended solids is the most significant factor affecting pollen concentration in the Yellow River, with this effect being particularly prominent outside the Shanxi-Shaanxi Gorge. Abundant coarse sand and rapid flow velocities are likely responsible for the high suspended solids concentration and lower pollen concentration observed in the mainstream of the Shanxi-Shaanxi Gorge. In sediments, clay content is the primary factor influencing pollen concentration, and its interaction with silt and flow velocity has a more prominent influence on pollen concentration. At the Yellow River section below the Shanxi-Shaanxi Gorge, sediment pollen and clay concentrations significantly increase. The changes in pollen concentration in the river water before and after the reservoir are consistent with the suspended solids concentration, while the changes in sediment pollen concentration are consistent with the clay content. Notably, pollen concentrations in sediments decrease more significantly after passing through a reservoir compared to changes observed in river water samples. Overall, there is a strong correlation between river pollen and topsoil pollen, which can provide a reliable reflection of the broader vegetation landscape of the watershed. The findings can provide support for paleoenvironmental reconstruction using pollen from alluvial sediments or lakes with river inflows.

This study applied wavelet transform analysis to 8-year TP time series data from the Shanxi Reservoir and its inflowing rivers. Key findings include the following: (1) Morlet wavelet decomposition revealed dominant 8-16-month cycles for reservoir TP, contrasting with 4-8-month cycles in river TP; (2) wavelet coherence analysis identified a 90 degrees phase lag (2-4 months delay) between reservoir and river TP at the 8-16-month scale; and (3) the time-frequency localization capability quantified rapid responses-reservoir TP reacted within 2 months to abrupt river TP increases, showing stronger intensity. Multi-resolution analysis further distinguished the driving mechanisms: interannual cycles (>12 months) governed reservoir TP variations, while seasonal cycles (<8 months) controlled river TP fluctuations. The study demonstrated wavelet analysis' dual strengths: resolving scale-specific interactions through multi-scale decomposition and quantifying transient responses via phase coherence metrics. The 90 degrees phase shift exposes hysteresis in TP transport, and the 2-month response threshold defines critical intervention timing. An adaptive monitoring framework is proposed as follows: <= 8-month sampling under stable conditions and 2-month intervals during TP surges, providing a time-frequency decision tool for precise reservoir water quality management.

During blooms, denitrification is a key process for nitrogen removal, which can occur both in the sediment and in the waterbody mediated by cyanobacterial aggregate (CA)-associated microorganisms. In this study, the structure, dynamics and assembly mechanisms of CA-associated nirK-, nirS-, and nosZ-encoding denitrifying communities were investigated in the eutrophic Lake Taihu across the bloom season. External environmental factors showed limited influence on denitrifying community structure, which were more strongly shaped by biotical factors. Network analysis revealed both monofunctional and multifunctional modules, with a small subset of linker OTUs playing a critical role in maintaining these multifunctional modules by mediating interactions among different functional communities. Biotic regulation was further demonstrated by coupling patterns among denitrifiers associated with specific microbial lineages, as well as niche partitioning driven by cyanobacterial composition. While the assembly of the total phycospheric communities was governed by stochastic processes, the denitrifying communities were predominantly shaped by homogeneous selection. These findings indicate biological processes, particularly synergistic relationships and autotroph-heterotroph interactions, were key drivers of the structure and dynamics of denitrifying communities within CAs. Moreover, the key taxa identified in this study may provide potential targets for regulating nitrogen cycling in the management of cyanobacterial blooms.					; Wang, Ruiyu/KIH-7431-2024	Chen, Zhijie/0000-0002-5416-3345; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				MAR 1	2025	268								120754	10.1016/j.envres.2025.120754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.120754		MAR 2025						39755200					WOS:001411369000001

Comparing indoor and outdoor temperature and air pollution at an urban cooling center: a multiyear case study	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: HEALTH												Anthropogenic climate change and urbanization have resulted in increasing needs to provide public health protection from the hazards of elevated PM2.5, elevated ozone and extreme heat (or cold) to the public. This is a particularly urgent issue for sensitive groups that are most subject to these hazards, such as the elderly, children, health compromised, and homeless populations. In this study, we compare the indoor versus outdoor temperature and air pollution levels between 17 May 2022 and 31 October 2023 in Salt Lake City, Utah at an older (Northwest Recreation Center) and newer building (Northwest Community Center). Differences between indoor and outdoor ozone were pronounced, with mean indoor ozone being generally similar to 40% of outdoor values. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations compared to outdoor value show seasonal variability and were up to 200% higher during wildfires compared to indoor concentration during wintertime inversion events. We found that the older building was less protective against ozone and wildfire PM2.5 pollution than the newer building. Future research could focus on characterizing and quantifying the impact of building age, insulation, and mechanical ventilation on indoor pollutant migration and separate these factors from human activity.

Long-term studies offer a unique opportunity for detecting changes in the zooplankton taxa composition related to climate change. Sampling zooplankton organisms alongside abiotic variables, such as water column temperature, enables the linking of changes in plankton communities with variations in the stratification regime. This provides evidence of direct and indirect warming effects. Our study in Lake Maggiore investigated variations in the population density and persistence of Diaphanosoma brachyurum, a thermophile species that is a member of the original zooplankton community of the lake, along with the increase in water temperature and the duration of the thermal stratification during the period 2013-2023. Our results highlighted an increase in the abundance and persistence of Diaphanosoma during the study period, along with an increase in the mean water temperature of the layer 0-10 m and of the length of the thermal stratification. Such changes, affecting the population dynamics of predators and competitors and their food sources (i.e., small algae), might lead to a rearrangement of the structure of the pelagic food chain.

The reported impacts associated with this invasion are numerous, including overall food web structure modifications. This review focuses on H. anomala, examining its biology, ecology, distribution and ecological impacts. The species' rapid success is attributed to its high fecundity, fast growth rates and broad adaptability to various habitats. Recent observations suggest that its distribution may expand further, especially in Western European lakes, reservoirs and the Laurentian Great Lakes. We present insights into its habitat, seasonal dynamics and influence on trophic interactions within native zooplankton communities. Additionally, we discuss methods used to study H. anomala, including citizen-science initiatives that enhance data collection and community engagement. The objective of this research is to provide up-to-date pieces of information on H. anomala's ecology, including new data on its habitat preferences collected through scientific diving and participatory research. By characterising the spatial and temporal variation in its occurrence and abundance, we identify key environmental and biotic factors that may limit or support its further spread. We also highlight knowledge gaps and research priorities for future studies to better assess its impacts on the food webs of invaded ecosystems.

Stocking density affects growth and economics of rearing Amur carp (Cyprinus carpio haematopterus) in floating cage in floodplain wetland of the River Brahmaputra	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The study evaluates the effect on growth-and related economic benefits of rearing commercially important food fish, Amur carp, Cyprinus carpid haematopterus fry, in a cage culture system, influenced by stocking densities. Methodology: A 90 day long rearing experiment was conducted in a seasonally opened ecologically sensitive floodplain wetland of the Brahmaputra riverine system at Jaluguti Beel. Floating cages of 6x4x2 m with an effective volume of 40 m(2) were used for rearing the fish. Experimental fish (n=10800) of initial weight and length 0.17 +/- 0.01 g and 1.90 +/- 0.05 cm (mean +/- SE), respectively, were distributed among four different stocking densities: SD15 (15 fish m(3)), SD20 (20 fish m(2)), SD25 (25 fish m(3)), and SD30 (30 fish m") executed in triplicates, following a completely randomized design. Results: The overall growth of fish was significantly (P<0.05) influenced by varied stocking densities. The specific growth rate of reared fish in different stocking densities were 3.43 +/- 0.04,4.20 +/- 0.06, 2.96 +/- 0.02, and 2.71 +/- 0.02, in SD15, SD20, SD25 and SD30, respectively. The biomass (kg per cage) achieved in different stocking densities were 35.90 +/- 0.20,38.50 +/- 0.31,37.20 +/- 0.35 and 35.40 +/- 0.50. Interpretation: The present findings found an inverse relation between growth performance and stocking density. The study also proposes that rearing of Amur carp fry at a stocking density of 20 fish min a welland-based cage aquaculture system yields a better growth response without compromising the benefit cost ratio.																			0254-8704	2394-0379				MAR	2025	46	2					197	203		10.22438/jeb/46/2/MRN-5411	http://dx.doi.org/10.22438/jeb/46/2/MRN-5411													WOS:001432830000006

We evaluated the vine vigor, prevalence of common diseases, yield, and postharvest fruit weight loss. We observed that cultivar significantly impacted vine vigor and the prevalence of three common diseases. One year after planting, the cultivars Thomcord, Marquis, and Lakemont had significantly less vigor than that of other cultivars, and Thomcord and Marquis both exhibited high mortality (38% and 29%, respectively). 'Marquis' and 'Thomcord' consistently showed among the highest prevalence of most diseases present in the vineyard (powdery mildew, anthracnose, and downy mildew), whereas 'Concord Seedless', 'Canadice', and 'Mars' consistently showed among the fewest symptoms. 'Thomcord' and 'Marquis' were removed from the experiment in 2019. For the six remaining cultivars, the cultivar, year, training system, and all interaction terms significantly affected yield. 'Mars' produced the highest yield throughout the study, reaching a maximum yield of over 15 kg/vine in their seventh season in the vineyard. Overall, yields of vines growing on the Munson training system were greater than those growing on the VSP system (P < 0.0001), although the advantages of growing on Munson were greater for some cultivars than for others (e.g., the yield advantages in 2021 were only 8% for 'Lakemont' but reached 90% for 'Concord Seedless' and 74.8% for 'Vanessa'). 'Mars' exhibited the lowest percentage weight loss after 28 days of cold storage, which was significantly lower than that of all cultivars except Reliance. In conclusion, 'Mars', 'Canadice', 'Vanessa', and 'Lakemont' offer potential for commercial production of seedless table grapes in the northeastern United States based on producing moderate to high yields of consistently high-quality fruit; of these, 'Mars' showed the least susceptibility to common diseases and postharvest weight loss.																			0018-5345	2327-9834				MAR	2025	60	3					278	286		10.21273/HORTSCI18272-24	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI18272-24													WOS:001416017900003
J	Studden, BM; Fernandes, T; Mcmeans, B				Studden, Brett M.; Fernandes, Timothy; Mcmeans, Bailey			Ovivorous Opportunities: Predation Events During Nest Guarding in a Freshwater Fish Species	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The construction and defense of nests leading up to and following spawning is widespread across freshwater fishes. Despite the known role of nesting in sexual selection and the establishment of social hierarchy, how nesting and nest guarding behavior may shape predation risk for both offspring and nest guarding individuals remains relatively underexplored for many species. Here, we documented a novel interaction between a nest guarding fish species, the pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus), and common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) during the pumpkinseed nesting period. Field surveys were conducted over 3 days in an Ontario wetland to document nest densities, predator presence, and predation attempts by potential nest predators. A total of 118 pumpkinseed nests were observed, with all but five nests located in colonies. In nine instances, adult snapping turtles were recorded inspecting guarded pumpkinseed nests. On two occasions, snapping turtles were observed consuming nest contents, as indicated by a gulping motion while on the nest. Male pumpkinseed exhibited defensive behaviors, such as diversion and aggression. Following these interactions, we returned to quantify nest abandonment in three nests and observed that pumpkinseed had abandoned each nest within 48 h. While no observations of predation by snapping turtles on adult sunfish were made, other opportunistic predators made foraging attempts on guarding males. Though nest guarding can improve egg and offspring survival, our results document that predators are still capable of consuming nest contents even while guarded. Omnivorous foraging on fish eggs that are only briefly available to consumers but spatially aggregated in specific spawning habitats and nest colonies warrants future work evaluating the impact of nesting for: (1) adult and offspring survival across systems with divergent predator communities, and (2) the contribution of egg consumption to the seasonal energy budgets of egg predators.					; Fernandes, Timothy/AAC-3661-2020	Studden, Brett/0009-0005-3005-4266; Fernandes, Timothy/0000-0001-6277-5619; 													2045-7758					MAR	2025	15	3							e70951	10.1002/ece3.70951	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70951								40083729					WOS:001444135200001

Several years of observations, based on its concentration enables to prognosticate algae blooms. It allows taking protective measures of water against the phenomenon of "water blooms". Therefore this paper assays determination of the seasonal changes in the content of this indicator in the artifical lake waters, which are under the influence of a strong human impact. Included in paper research of sesonal variation of concentrations of chlorophyll "a" in the waters of Siematyczne Reservoir, were systematically pursued in seven measurement-control points in the hydrological year, i.e. November 2021-October 2022.

Seasonally Dynamic Dissolved Carbon Cycling in a Large Hard Water Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Inland waters play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, with lakes integrating carbon from various sources within their catchment in addition to that fixed by local primary productivity. Isotopic measurements of carbon pools can differentiate contributions from these sources, with natural abundance radiocarbon (14C) a particularly powerful tool due to the large range in 14C characteristics among carbon sources. Here, we present 14C measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from monthly water column samplings over the course of a year in Lake Geneva, a large oligotrophic hard water perialpine lake in Western Europe. We find that DIC in the lake is significantly 14C-depleted relative to the atmosphere primarily due to the dissolution of carbonate rocks in the lake's catchment. Variability in DI14C is largely tied to the Rh & ocirc;ne River inflow, where DI14C values were also found to vary seasonally. DOC has a 14C signature similar to that of DIC, reflecting the fact that much of the lake DOC pool is autochthonous. However, more 14C-depleted DOC was observed in July and tied to increased river discharge from snow and glacier melt within the upper Rh & ocirc;ne River basin. These observations shed light on carbon sources and dynamics within Lake Geneva and its alpine catchment and highlight the importance of preaged dissolved carbon inputs to the largest natural lake in Western Europe.					; Haghipour, Negar/K-9683-2017	Mittelbach, Benedict Victor Adrian/0000-0002-2290-5324; White, Margot Elizabeth/0000-0002-0095-7641													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2025	130	3							e2024JG008645	10.1029/2024JG008645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008645													WOS:001467962700001

But the spatiotemporal variability of turbidity, which is important for understanding comprehensive changes in the water quality and status of aquatic ecosystems, remains unclear on a global scale. In this study, the spatial distribution pattern, seasonal variability, spatiotemporal variability, and influencing factors of turbidity in 774 lakes worldwide have been investigated using the turbidity product of Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) derived from Sentinel-3 OLCI. We found that 63.4% of lakes show low turbidity (<= 5 Nephelometric Turbidity Units). The ranking of turbidity by climate zone is as follows: arid climate > tropical climate > temperate climate similar to polar climate > cold climate. Turbidity decreased significantly in 40% of studied lakes, and increased significantly in 32% lakes. The lake with low turbidity has less seasonal variation, and there is a large seasonal variation in lake turbidity in the tropical and polar climate zones of Northern Hemisphere. Positive covariates to turbidity of global lakes include wind speed of lake, slope, surface runoff, and population in the catchment. Conversely, negative covariates include lake area, volume, discharge, inflow of lake, and GDP. Abundant water volume, favorable flow conditions, and more financial investments in lake management can help to reduce turbidity. These findings highlight the spatiotemporal changes of global lake turbidity and underlying mechanisms in controlling the variability, providing valuable insights for future lake water quality management.

We assessed differences in the relative importance of local and seasonal environmental conditions versus spatial factors in explaining differences in community composition (i.e., beta-diversity patterns) in microbial plankton of 39 mid-latitude Chilean lakes spanning representative ecological gradients in altitude, mixing depth and water chemistry. The assemblages were taxonomically profiled by paired-end high throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S and the V4 region of the 18S rRNA genes. Variation partitioning analyses revealed that the explanatory power of environmental and seasonal factors versus spatial variables and their mutual overlap varied considerably among taxa and functional groups. More than 12 % of the variation in community structure was uniquely explained by environmental factors in the phytoplankton groups Dinophyta, Ochrophyta and Cyanobacteria, as well as in oligotrophic ultramicrobacteria, such as small rhodopsin containing Actinobacteria and LD12 Alphaproteobacteria. In phago-heterotrophic and saprotrophic groups, including heterotrophic micro-eukaryotes, and Bacteroidetes, environmental factors explained a smaller or even insignificant portion of the differences in the community structure. Our findings suggest that in Chilean lake microplankton, complex traits related to ecological and trophic strategy appear to affect the relative effect of local environmental properties on their community composition and hence the strength of species sorting along limnological gradients.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				MAR	2025	111								126233	10.1016/j.limno.2025.126233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2025.126233		FEB 2025											WOS:001436941600001

Impacts of faulty grey infrastructures on the bathymetry and salinity of Vembanad Lake, a tropical estuary along the south west coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The fast degradation in bathymetry, floodwater retention capacity, and changes in salinity regimes of Vembanad-the largest wetland system in South India-and its impacts on the ecosystem services are assessed using high-resolution data sets on bathymetry and hydrography. Strengthening the outer banks of Kuttanad polders to promote paddy cultivation led to a sharp decline in its sediment (suspended) filtration potential, promoting heavy siltation and depth shrinkage of Vembanad Lake. With an area of 315 sq.km and an average depth of 8.5 m (south sector)/7.87 m (central sector), the lake had a retention capacity of 2617.5 MCM floodwaters in 1930 which was reduced to 384.7 MCM by 2020 (85.3% loss in retention capacity) due to area (162.5 sq.km) and depth (average 1.8 m in the south sector and 2.87 m in the central sector) shrinkages. This resulted in the prolonged inundation of low-lying areas and increased incidences of flash floods. Both sectors of the lake maintain limnetic and well-mixed conditions during the monsoon whereas during non-monsoon season, the central sector turns to polyhaline/mesohaline and oligohaline conditions with stratified, partially mixed, and well-mixed salinity stratifications unlike the south sector which perennially remain limnetic and well mixed. The observed shift in salinity regimes appears to promote hypertrophic conditions, biodiversity loss, and a sharp reduction in the black clam abundance of the south sector, which before the commissioning of Thannermukkom Barrage (TMB) was a major clam ground.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB 27	2025	197	3							336	10.1007/s10661-025-13773-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-13773-5								40014166					WOS:001435004800005
J	Le, TV; Nguyen, BT				Le, Thang Viet; Nguyen, Binh Thanh			Unveiling the interactive effects: seasonal variations and pollution sources shaping the quality of surface water system in Khanh Hoa, Vietnam	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												While numerous studies have examined pollution sources and seasonal effects on surface water quality independently, the complex interactions between these factors remain understudied. This research aimed to fractionate and quantify pollution sources and examine their interactive effects with seasonal variations on surface water quality in Khanh Hoa, Vietnam. The current study was based on 1080 surface water samples taken from three common water bodies - lakes, rivers, and canals across dry and rainy seasons and analyzed for 13 physiochemical properties. Findings revealed that surface water quality was influenced by four primary pollution sources: agricultural activities, residential areas, onsite erosion, and climatic factors. Agricultural sources dominated canal water quality (93.0-94.7%) but had less impact on lakes and rivers (12.8-23.8%). Residential sources significantly affected lakes and rivers (30.23-32.66%) but minimally influenced canals (2.6-5.6%). Onsite erosion sources had greater impacts on lakes and rivers typically during the rainy season and exhibited minimal impacts on canals. Lakes and rivers maintained consistent and higher water quality across seasons (water quality index (WQI) 9.1 to 9.3 out of 1.0 - excellent), while canals exhibited substantially lower quality in the dry season (WQI 0.75) compared to the rainy season (WQI 0.78). These interactive impacts were mitigated by self-purification, water residence time in lakes and rivers, dilution effects, and fast pollutant transport in canals. Our findings highlight the importance of effective management of these key pollution sources in interaction with seasonal variation for maintaining water quality and ensuring environmental sustainability.

An Exploration of Different Detection Methods in Northern Wisconsin	FORESTS												Foresters and natural resource managers are increasingly exploring opportunities for the early detection of emerging forest health concerns. One of these emerging concerns is the eastern larch beetle (ELB, Dendroctonus simplex LeConte), a native insect of tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K., Koch). Historically, the ELB attacked only dead or dying trees, but with climate change, it is now becoming a damaging disturbance agent that affects healthy trees as well. This shift creates a need to evaluate the methods used to detect and quantify the impacted areas. In northern Wisconsin, USA, 50 tamarack stands or aerial detection polygons were surveyed in the field during the 2023 growing season to explore different detection tools for ELBs. We visited 20 polygons identified by aerial sketch map surveys as having ELB mortality, 20 tamarack stands identified by the Astrape satellite imagery algorithm as disturbed, and 10 randomly selected stands from the Wisconsin forest inventory database (WisFIRs) for landscape-level context. For each of the detection methods and the Random stands, information on species composition, mortality, signs of ELB, invasive species, and water presence was quantified. ELBs were common across the landscape, but were not always associated with high levels of mortality. While overstory tree mortality was frequently observed in both aerial sketch map surveys and Astrape, it was not always linked to tamarack mortality. Current methods of detection may need to be re-evaluated in this environment. Tamarack stands in northern Wisconsin were highly heterogeneous in species, which is likely contributing to the difficulties in identifying both tamarack mortality and tamarack mortality specifically caused by ELBs across the two detection methods. Given the evolving impacts of climate change and the shifting dynamics between forests and insects, it is essential to evaluate and innovate detection methods to manage these ecosystems effectively.

Larval fish congregation and survival are largely dependent on abiotic and biotic potential of such systems and many migrant marine fishes are adapted to them. However, occurrences of larval forms of tropical reef-associated vagrant species which are known for extensive range adaptations generate considerable academic interest. The present study provides the first report of ontogenic habitat utilization of yellow fin surgeon fish, Acanthurus xanthopterus Valenciennes 1835 in a tropical microtidal positive estuary, the Vembanad lake, South India. Surface plankton collections from the downstream part of the estuary revealed considerable proportions of acanthurid larvae in post monsoon (mean 354 +/- 180 numbers/100 m3) and pre monsoon (mean 217 +/- 120 numbers/100 m3) while they were absent in monsoon season. These acronurus larval forms were morphologically identified and sorted before being subjected for DNA barcoding. Mitochondrial DNA COI sequences developed from morphologically characterized acronurus larvae exhibited genetic congruency to sequence of A. xanthopterus which was evident from phylogram (bootstrap support of 100) and genetic distance data (intraspecific distance of 0%). The study indicates that Acronurus larvae of A. xanthopterus, after extensive cross-habitat dispersal, utilize the estuarine habitat to promote potential growth.

Understanding the biogeochemical cycling of trace metal micronutrients in the global ocean has been a focus of intense research over several decades. Conversely, investigations into the cycling of trace metals in lakes have been relatively rare. This study investigated the biogeochemical cycling of five biologically important trace metals, namely manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc in three New Zealand lakes of different trophic state. The surface water in the three lakes was sampled monthly over a year, during which depth profile samples were collected twice. The samples were analysed to examine how trace metal speciation and phytoplankton productivity interact in the three lakes over time. The cycling of the metals was driven by the different physicochemical and biogeochemical factors distinctive for each lake, including water column oxygen concentrations and the extent to which each metal was bound to particulates. Intriguingly, increased biological uptake or limitation of growth during times of high phytoplankton growth was not observed for any of the investigated trace metals. This is of interest, especially as many of the trace metals investigated were present in sub-nanomolar bioavailable concentrations. The results from this study emphasise the important role biogeochemical cycling plays in regulating the distributions and bioavailability of trace metals in lakes.

The sites Aldeia (121 ha) and Porto (89 ha) form part of the largest archaeological complex found today in any urban area of Amazonia. The article describes the research methods employed, including augering, geophysical prospecting, and stratigraphic excavation, and presents the contexts of cultural occupation, as well as the chronology, which confirms the contemporaneity of these sites between a.d. 1200 and 1600. Both sites are habitational, while the Aldeia site appears to have been a ceremonial center with features for depositing shamanic artifacts. The article argues that although evidence has been found for a hierarchy of sites within the region, this does not imply political centralization but rather situates the Aldeia site as a place of ritual convergence, thus pointing to other ways of thinking about social complexity.																			0093-4690	2042-4582				2025 FEB 20	2025										10.1080/00934690.2025.2466877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00934690.2025.2466877		FEB 2025											WOS:001432667100001

In this study, in order to investigate the impacts of dam-related water impoundment on OPEs, seven reservoirs in the Wujiang River (WJR) were investigated in January, April, July, and October 2017, and the occurrence and distribution of eight OPEs were evaluated. The results showed that the content of the eight OPEs ranged from 0.83 to 2745 ng/g dw. The main component was tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). Spatially, the OPEs decreased from upstream to downstream. Temporally, the OPE content showed a trend of July > October >= January > April. Socioeconomic and hydrological factors had significant effects on the distribution of OPEs, and the empirical model of OPEs with gross domestic product (GDP) and reservoir age (RA) as parameters was established. This provided a basis for OPE estimation and treatment direction for the reservoir. In addition, the relevant data regarding OPEs and total organic carbon (TOC) in terrigenous sediments from previous studies showed a significant correlation (r = 0.63, P < 0.01). The significantly high risk quotient (RQ) estimated for OPEs, especially tris(methylphenyl) phosphate (TMPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP), suggest potential adverse risk.

At the center of our model is an empirical model based on a basic mechanistic assumption about microcystin production in lakes (i.e., microcystin concentration is proportional to the biomass of cyanobacteria Microcystis spp.). Using the Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, we allow the proportional constant to vary by year and season. An iterative updating algorithm was used to sequentially update the model, allowing the hierarchical model be used for short-term forecasting as new data become available. Our predictive model includes an ensemble of four alternative representations of seasonal variation. These alternatives are evaluated at each iterative step and the short-term prediction is the weighted average of these alternative predictions with weighs based on their predictive accuracy.

That highlights the need to comprehensively analyze the changing dynamics driven by human activities and climate change. Satellite imagery analysis from 1987 to 2022 reveals that the surface area of Maharloo Lake has decreased from 270 to 252 square kilometers due to land use changes. Moreover, the water level of the lake has declined by 30% during the wet season (May) and 90.2% during the dry season (October). The primary factors contributing to this decline include changes in temperature, potential evapotranspiration, excessive groundwater extraction, and the diversion of surface water for agriculture and urban development. These changes have transformed Maharloo Lake from a permanent to a seasonal lake, leading to an increase in the overall extent of barren, saline lands. The lake sediments are predominantly composed of fine-grained, destructive deposits with chemical salts, with over 90% being silt and clay. The average maximum wind speed and threshold erosion velocity indicate a reduced role of wind in eroding the lake's surface sediments, and the low levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and Total Suspended Particulates (TSP) particles around the lake suggest the sediments are resistant to wind erosion and have not been a significant source of dust storms thus far. Understanding the nature of the sediments and their sensitivity to wind erosion, as well as the influence of the erosive wind factor in the occurrence of dust storms, is crucial. One cannot uniformly consider all lakes or dried lake beds as sources of dust storms based solely on changes in water levels.

Dietary patterns and sympatry in Lake Titicaca (Bolivia): the role of seasonality in niche overlap between native Andean killifish	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The coexistence of sympatric species is often attributed to differences in ecological niches, to attenuate competition in the use for limited resources. In the context of seasonal and habitat variation of food availability, species may adjust their diets to avoid competition and optimize resource partitioning. This study quantifies the feeding patterns of three sympatric native killifish species (Orestias agassizii, Orestias luteus, and Orestias mulleri) to understand competitive interactions and how benthic macroinvertebrate availability influences their trophic niches across different habitats and seasons. Benthic macroinvertebrate availability and gut contents were analyzed from individuals captured in inshore and offshore habitats during two contrasted seasons (wet/transition in April and dry in July). We observed temporal but not spatial differences in the composition of macroinvertebrate taxa. We characterized the fish diet using four indices (richness, diversity, diet breadth, and diet overlapping). All Orestias species primarily fed on amphipods (Hyalella spp.), with O. luteus and O. mulleri showing a micro-carnivorous inclination, mainly consuming amphipods and molluscs in the offshore zones. Conversely, O. agassizii exhibited a versatile omnivorous pattern. Higher diet overlap was observed among Orestias species in the dry season (July), indicating temporal influences. The temporal variation in diet between habitats may respond to changes in diet item abundance, particularly amphipods, underscoring the influence of diet item availability shifts on these killifish's dietary preferences. Our findings emphasize the importance of amphipods and molluscs in the diet of Orestias; they also provide a basis for diet seasonality as a potential explanation for the coexistence of these sympatric species.					; Janssens, Geert/C-2264-2008; Loayza, Erick/LYO-4073-2024	Loayza, Erick/0000-0002-0581-0008; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				MAR	2025	108	3					397	411		10.1007/s10641-025-01677-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-025-01677-9		FEB 2025											WOS:001420037700001

To investigate the factors driving such outbreaks, we conducted long-term monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA), focusing on Potamogeton pusillus and Stuckenia pectinata in Lake Shinji, a brackish lake in Japan. We performed eDNA analysis of these two submerged macrophytes using monthly water samples collected from 2016 to 2022. This allowed us to estimate annual fluctuations and seasonal patterns in biomass based on eDNA concentrations of both species. Additionally, it was suggested-and these results were consistent with the trends of field observations-that the biomass of S. pectinata has recently increased relative to that of P. pusillus. In analyzing the relationships between eDNA concentrations and five water parameters (water temperature, pH, electric conductivity (EC), nitrate ion concentration (NO3-), and salinity) in Lake Shinji, we found that P. pusillus eDNA was positively correlated with water temperature and negatively correlated with salinity. No such relationship was observed for S. pectinata. Given that S. pectinata has a higher tolerance to salinity than P. pusillus, the recent increase in salinity of Lake Shinji may have led to a shift from P. pusillus to S. pectinata as dominant species. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use long-term eDNA monitoring to evaluate the biomass of submerged macrophytes in a lake and to explore the underlying causes.

Despite the demonstrated sensitivity of fish growth responses to climate change on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), the geographical variations in these responses remain unclear. This study analyzed the growth responses of schizothoracine fish to environmental variables in four geographically distinct QTP lakes (Qinghai Lake, Yamdrok Lake, Pangong Tso, and Co Nag) using otolith biochronologies and hierarchical mixed-effects modeling and quantified the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to fish growth variations. Overall, we found that the optimal model accounted for 82% of the annual growth variability. Age variables were the intrinsic factors primarily influencing fish growth (significant and negative, accounting for 92% of the explained variability), followed by the influence of extrinsic environmental factors at the local (i.e., air temperature and precipitation, significant and positive, 5%), global (i.e., sea surface temperature [SST], significant and negative, 2%), and regional (i.e., monsoon intensity, nonsignificant and negative, 0.4%) scales. At the lake level, the influences of environmental factors on fish growth aligned with overall results but showed varied contributions. Therefore, local factors primarily influence fish growth responses, emphasizing that geographical variations in fish responses to climate change should be accounted for in relevant population predictions. This study provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between fish growth and multi-scale environmental changes and offers scientific support for ecosystem management under climate change on the QTP.

This study explored the spatial distribution and cycling of DIC during the wet season at four cascade power stations: Wudongde (WDD), Baihetan (BHT), Xiluodu (XLD), and Xiangjiaba (XJB). The results indicate that the primary sources of DIC at these stations are the result of carbonate rocks weathering by carbonic acid and sulfuric/nitric acids. Specifically, DIC production from weathering at WDD significantly surpasses that at the other stations (BHT, XLD, XJB) under the sulfuric/nitric acid weathering conditions (p < 0.05). In the cascade reservoirs of the Jinsha River, biochemical processes predominantly facilitate the precipitation of calcium carbonate. Among these reservoirs, XLD exhibits the highest efficiency in converting DIC into calcite, with a transformation rate of Delta DICtrans reaching 2.62 Tg/year. During the wet season, the combined effects of air temperature, wind speed, and partial pressure result in higher average CO2 emissions from the cascade power stations in the Jinsha River and Yellow River basins compared to other cascade power stations, comparable to emissions from the Three Gorges Reservoir. Specifically, XLD exhibits the highest CO2 emission rate (FCO2 = 102.38 +/- 94.71 mmol/m2/d). Nevertheless, these levels are lower than those observed in most natural rivers globally. Buffer factor analysis indicates that the carbonate buffering capacity of the Jinsha River cascade reservoirs is relatively weak, with an average Revelle coefficient of approximately 41.4. These results enhance our understanding of carbon cycling in the Jinsha River's cascade power stations and provide crucial insights. for preserving the long-term stability of river ecosystems.

Inferring microalgae density and net ecosystem production on soft sediments using infrared imaging	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Measuring microalgae density in soft-sediment benthos has challenges for even the most sophisticated methods. If the goal is to assess the photosynthetic potential of epipelon, then microalgae should be sampled only at the surface of the benthos to the depth of light penetration. Furthermore, microalgae density may show spatial and temporal variability that can only be captured by using many point samples and nondestructive sampling. Here, we use simple near-infrared (NIR) imagery to assess surface density of microalgae in soft underwater sediments and to infer their photosynthetic capacity. In lab studies, NIR imagery gives estimates of epipelon density that are strongly correlated with standard chlorophyll a (Chl a) assays using pigment extraction and fluorometry (Radj2$$ {R}_{\mathrm{adj}}<^>2 $$ = 0.70), but NIR imagery is better able to separate experimental treatments. In analyses of sediment samples from a lake, NIR imagery gives estimates of epipelon Chl a density that are strongly correlated to net ecosystem production (NEP). Near-infrared imagery also gives a fine-grained assessment of the spatial distribution of epipelon that helps to explain the relationship between epipelon density and NEP. Finally, images from an underwater NIR camera over the course of a wind disturbance event give estimates of the relative density of microalgae that is buried and is likely to be, at least temporarily, photosynthetically inactive. These results show that NIR imagery provides an easy and nondestructive method for sampling surface densities of microalgae which is particularly suitable for remote field locations and for educational settings in which students can generate results with cheap and robust equipment.

Excellent organic preservation, precise excavation, and rigorous radiocarbon sample selection permit the application of Bayesian chronological modelling. Over 250 radiocarbon results date a dozen Mesolithic sites to an extended period between the 9th and 7th millennia BCE. Each site may only have been used briefly - perhaps only for a single season in some cases - but some were used repeatedly over the course of decades or even centuries. Site chronological models reveal sharp fluctuations in the overall level of recorded Mesolithic activity. A spike in the intensity and diversity of activity coincided with the rapid expansion of hazel (Corylus avellana) at the start of the Boreal biozone, but a steep decline in dated activity in the later 9th millennium BCE may be an artefact of changes in lake level, rather than reflecting a response to vegetation change, climate deterioration or societal reconfiguration. Although the Duvensee radiocarbon results can be construed to support arguments that rapid climate change had a significant impact on human activity, known climate events occurred when the record of human occupation at Duvensee was already discontinuous. It is therefore difficult to infer (or exclude) environmental factors as triggers of changes in the archaeological record. Our results suggest focusing research on the early Boreal phase, during which the widest range of site-types is preserved and accessible for archaeological investigation.					; Kleijne, Jos/AAA-8873-2019; Meadows, John/AAU-2326-2020	Kleijne, Jozua Petrus/0000-0002-5854-7055; Meadows, John/0000-0002-4346-5591													0277-3791	1873-457X				APR 1	2025	353								109230	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109230	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109230		FEB 2025											WOS:001423400600001

Researchers collected samples over a year, analyzing fungal variations during dusty and normal days. The average fungal concentration was found to be 436.2 CFU/m3, with Cladosporium cladosporioides, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Cladosporium iridis being the most prevalent species. Notably, fungal concentrations during dust days averaged 967.65 CFU/m3, which is 3.6 times higher than on normal days (267.10 CFU/m3). A total of 61 species were detected on normal days, compared to 45 on dusty days, with Aspergillus and Cladosporium spp. dominating both conditions. The study also linked environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and wind speed to fungal concentrations. Additionally, the distribution of dust was analyzed using the HYSPLIT model and MODIS satellite imagery, highlighting the health risks associated with high fungal concentrations and changing mycobiota due to dust disturbances.

J	Zhang, F; Zhang, XQ				Zhang, Fang; Zhang, Xueqin			Quantifying lake heat storage's impacts on lake evaporation for an alpine deep lake lacking water-temperature-profile observation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake heat storage is essential in regulating lake evaporation's magnitude and seasonal variation. However, its impacts on lake evaporation are inadequately investigated, mainly due to the limited lake-water-temperature- profile observations used to calculate lake heat storage, challenging the accurate quantification of lake evaporation. Hence, we integrate multiple-source observations and multiple-model simulations to quantify lake heat storage and its impacts on lake evaporation in the ice-free period for Yamzhog Yumco, an alpine deep lake in the southern Tibetan Plateau. We first calculate lake heat storage based on a regression relationship between the modeled (Rn - G) and EC-observed (H + LE) to deal with the energy non-closure problem inherent in the EC system. Then, we quantify lake heat storage's impacts on evaporation using multiple evaporation estimation models with lake heat storage considered or not and observations of three types of evaporators. The PE-III model can optimally estimate lake evaporation when considering lake heat storage. By contrast, the average daily evaporation is overestimated before early October while underestimating afterward with models neglecting lake heat storage, peaking 4-6 months earlier than EC observation. Besides, the observed evaporation differences between the EC technique and three types of evaporators vary with the evaporator scale related to heat storage magnitude. We also reveal that net radiation and heat storage capacity jointly control lake heat storage, whose impacts on lake evaporation are prominent when deepening lake depth. Our findings provide a framework to quantify lake heat storage and its impacts on lake evaporation over alpine deep lakes lacking water-temperature- profile observations, hopefully improving the accuracy of lake evaporation estimation and deepening the understanding of lake water and heat balance.

Vegetation fires emissions contain numerous organic compounds that impact the Earth system and human health. Here, we review the sources, stability, transport, degradation and geochemical records of levoglucosan, a dehydration monosaccharide produced by the pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. Levoglucosan has been detected in aerosols, water, snow and ice, and lake or marine sediments.

An urban rain garden in northwestern Indiana, USA, was continuously monitored from November 2019 to May 2021 to evaluate the fate of dissolved constituents entering the rain garden in runoff. Physical and chemical properties of soils in the rain garden were also monitored, along with underlying groundwater. Linear regression models relating specific conductance to chloride concentration indicated that the 0.0371-ha (3998 square feet) rain garden collected approximately 1490 kg (3285 pounds) of road salt from the surrounding 0.2228 ha (24,500 square feet) of impervious surfaces. Soils and groundwater were seasonally affected by road salt application but carryover from year to year was not indicated. Rain garden soil permeability (5.20 x 10-5 to 9.72 x 10-5 m/s) remained unchanged during the study period and soil organic carbon generally increased under native vegetation. The results suggest that a rain garden built on sandy soil can divert substantial quantities of runoff and dissolved constituents from combined sewers; however, chloride is transported to sub-infrastructure groundwater that eventually discharges to adjacent waterways with concentrations lower than those observed in runoff.																				2073-4441				FEB	2025	17	4							510	10.3390/w17040510	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17040510													WOS:001429508800001

It is preventable with vaccination, and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) improvements. However, the impact of vaccination in endemic settings remains unclear. Cholera is endemic in the city of Kalemie, on the shore of Lake Tanganyika, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where both seasonal mobility and the lake, a potential environmental reservoir, may promote transmission. Kalemie received a vaccination campaign and WASH improvements in 2013-2016. We assessed the impact of this intervention to inform future control strategies in endemic settings. We fit compartmental models considering seasonal mobility and environmentally-based transmission. We estimated the number of cases the intervention avoided, and the relative contributions of the elements promoting local cholera transmission. We estimated the intervention avoided 5,259 cases (95% credible interval: 1,576.6-11,337.8) over 118 weeks. Transmission did not rely on seasonal mobility and was primarily environmentally-driven. Removing environmental exposure or contamination could control local transmission. Repeated environmental exposure could maintain high population immunity and decrease the impact of vaccination in similar endemic areas. Addressing environmental exposure and contamination should be the primary target of interventions in such settings.					; Blake, Alexandre/HKW-8317-2023	Blake, Alexandre/0000-0002-1627-4992; 													1935-2735					FEB	2025	19	2							e0012867	10.1371/journal.pntd.0012867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012867								39970173					WOS:001426498100001

Determining the effect of these pressures on the water balance is challenging because of a lack of hydrological monitoring data, which impedes water management decisions. A collection of optical remote sensing and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) scenes is used in combination with supervised classification algorithms and topographical data to derive lake volumes for the period 1984-2023, which are analyzed for trends and correlation with satellite-derived climate data. New hydrological insights for the region: Although lake volumes show strong interannual variability, no significant historical trend is identified. A precipitation response time of approximately two months is observed, suggesting a considerable contribution of groundwater to the lake's water balance. Minimum lake volumes found for the period 2014-2017 coincide with a prolonged period of below-average precipitation, indicating the effect of decreased groundwater recharge. Dry season lake volumes show weak correlation with cumulative precipitation in comparison to rainy season lake volumes, further indicating the importance of groundwater inflow for the dry season water balance. Results suggest that climate change effects and anthropogenic activities may have little short-term impact on the lake's dry season volume, while altering groundwater recharge may have more significant long-term effects.

These lakes are of ecological importance because they are unique in Mexico. However, currently, the lakes have experienced changes in their shape and an increase in algae blooms, coupled with the degradation of the basin, which has alerted government entities to the need to address the lakes' problems. To address the environmental status of El Sol and La Luna, a trophic study was conducted during the period of 2021-2023, including an analysis of the influence of climatic variables, lake water quality, and eutrophication conditions. The trophic state was established based on the eutrophication index. The Pearson correlations defined the eutrophication interrelation between the distinct factors influencing the lakes' status. El Sol registered higher eutrophication conditions than La Luna. El Sol was identified as seasonal eutrophic and La Luna as transitioning from oligotrophic to mesotrophic, showing high levels of chlorophyll, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen and low water transparency. The principal factors altering the eutrophic conditions were water pollution and climatic variables (precipitation and ambient temperature). Eutrophication was the prime factor impacting perimeter loss at El Sol, whereas at La Luna, it was due to a decline in precipitation.

The Newly Formed Ribb Reservoir Could Serve as a Refugia for Conserving Ethiopia's Globally Unique Labeobarbus Species Flock	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												The 17 species of Labeobarbus found in Lake Tana constitute the only extant cyprinid species flock in the world but extensive water development projects are impacting their habitats. Here, we assess if the Labeobarbus spp. are established above the Ribb Dam, constructed in 2017, and if so, the condition of the individuals and if there is evidence of local recruitment. Fish samplings were conducted once a month during the Labeobarbus species' spawning season of July to the end of September 2022, using monofilament and multifilament gillnets at three locations upstream of the Ribb Dam. We collected 10 Labeobarbus spp., with L. intermedius (40.7%) being the most abundant followed by L. brevicephalus (23.0%) and L. nedgia (22.2%). Labeobarbus fork lengths ranged from 7.8 to 43.0 cm and there were no notable gaps across the size ranges. Fulton's condition factors for species where n >= 20 were 1.30-1.54 (good), like Lake Tana populations. Our collection included sexually immature and first-time maturing individuals, indicating Labeobarbus are reproducing and recruiting successfully in the watershed above the dam. Our results suggest that the Ribb River watershed above Ribb Dam may serve as a refugia for at least some of the 17 species of the species flock. However, challenges remain before the upper watershed should be viewed as a viable long-term habitat for Labeobarbus, including the need for a fisheries management program, pollution control and mitigation of catchment degradation in the uplands that is leading to the rapid infilling of the reservoir, where current estimates suggest a 30-year reservoir life span.

Paleosols in the Red-Colored Sediment Complex of the Cis-Sayan Basin (Southeastern Siberia)	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The studied red-colored sediments of the Mikhailovka section (south of the Irkutsk amphitheater) were formed in the course of discontinuous filling of an erosional landform dating back to the main phase of neotectonic uplift in the Late Pliocene-Early Quaternary. A pedocomplex of three paleosols with different degrees of preservation has been identified in this section. The paleosols developed during phases of decreasing activity of exogenous relief-forming processes. The analysis of the micromorphological features of the paleosols makes its it possible to identify the signs of biogenic structuring and biogenic forms of secondary carbonates in the upper horizons of the paleosols. Their middle-profile horizons have clear features of striated optical orientation of clay particles and contain carbonate pendants attesting to the mobility of ferruginous-clayey and carbonate substances in periods with different moistening conditions. The analysis of delta C-13 values of soil organic matter, as well as delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of carbonate nodules, indicates a significant role of pedogenesis in their origin and suggests that paleosol formation in the red-colored sediments could take place under hydrothermal conditions comparable to the modern ones in the studied area. At the same time, the observed isotopic equilibrium between the carbonate material and the paleosol organic matter suggests a less contrasting hydrothermal regime in the intra-annual cycle and a longer duration of the growing season. Soils and pedosediments formed within the red-colored strata also contain the signs of cryogenesis at the macro- and microlevels, which indicates pronounced tendencies toward climate cooling in the phases of transition from pedogenic to morpholithogenic stages.

Effects of revegetation approaches on wetland plant community reassembly under hydrologic extremes	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Active revegetation is often necessary to recover native plant communities in disturbed or degraded wetlands. However, active revegetation has been pursued less often in wetlands than other ecosystems and thus, there are few established best practices to guide implementation. Additionally, wetland revegetation is challenging due to dynamic hydrology becoming more extreme and high invasive plant propagule pressure that can limit native plant recruitment and favor invasive plant dominance. In this study, we tested the efficacy of varied revegetation approaches on native plant reassembly and invasion resistance in semi-arid wetlands subject to seasonal hydrologic fluctuations. In a Great Salt Lake wetland in Utah, USA, we introduced two functionally distinct native plant mixes, varied their method of introduction via seeding or planting, and varied their order of introduction over two planting dates. Unfortunately, there were no treatment effects on native or invasive cover, likely due to extreme drought in the first growing season followed by excessive flooding in the second. However, there were compositional shifts from drought-tolerant to flood-tolerant species throughout the study. Community compositional changes underscore the importance of including species with divergent and wide-ranging environmental tolerances in revegetation mixes to enhance native establishment across variable environmental conditions. This bet-hedging approach runs counter to the current focus on precision restoration-the method of prioritizing the "right seed in the right place at the right time"-but may be an effective strategy to combat unpredictable conditions given increasingly extreme site conditions.					; Kettenring, Karin/A-5829-2011	, Maddie Houde/0009-0009-5271-3997; Kettenring, Karin/0000-0001-7080-0407; 													0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2025	33	1							11	10.1007/s11273-024-10015-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-024-10015-2													WOS:001390542600001

QENP is a protected area in Western Uganda. MODIS and VIIRS data for a six-and-a-half-year period from January 2015- June 2021 were obtained to create an inventory of past fires. From these fires, spatial and temporal patterns were derived from exploratory spatial data analyses. The Weights of Evidence (WOE) method, a Bayesian form of statistical modelling, was used to determine the relationship between fires and wildfire conditioning factors, as well as to model wildfire susceptibility. Results of the study showed that the occurrence of wildfires within the study area vary seasonally. Sixty-one percent (61%) of the fires were observed to occur in the first dry season of the year, while thirty-one percent (31%) of the fires were observed to occur in the second dry season. Among the wildfire conditioning factors, altitude, vegetation (as measured by NDVI), and proximity to lakes indicated the highest correlation with the occurrence of fires. These conditions were attributed to physiographic influences, water stress in vegetation, and the socio-economic activities of the fishing villages around the lakes respectively. From the derived wildfire susceptibility maps, varying levels of wildfire susceptibility were determined. Proportional values of 19% and 20% of the study area were classified with very high and high susceptibility levels respectively. The remaining 61% of the study area was covered by moderate, low, and very low susceptibility levels. The study results provided vital findings about the seasonal patterns of wildfire occurrence, factors influencing the occurrence of wildfires and the locations most susceptible to wildfires. This information will enable managers to allocate fire management resources optimally to efficiently mitigate against wildfires within QENP.																			2225-8531					FEB	2025	14	1					38	56		10.4314/sajg.v14i1.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/sajg.v14i1.4													WOS:001421047600001

While cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic lakes are widely investigated, the dynamics of cyanobacteria and the effects of their toxins and bioactive metabolites on the plankton communities in mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes are less well understood. Here we investigated seasonal dynamics of cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae and cyanotoxins in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Geneva-the largest and deepest lake in western Europe. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes in 143 samples along a water column revealed that Lake Geneva hosts diverse, co-dominant cyanobacterial genera, including Planktothrix, Cyanobium, Pseudanabaena, and Aphanizomenon. The abundance of the mcyA gene marker for microcystin production was highly correlated with total cyanobacteria abundance, obtained from qPCR of the 16S rRNA genes. Targeted LCHRMS/MS analysis demonstrated peak concentrations of cyanotoxins in September and December 2021 at the deep chlorophyll-a maximum layer, reaching up to 1474 ng/l for anabaenopeptins and 144 ng/l for microcystins. The toxin peaks did not correlate with the abundance or variations in the cyanobacteria or eukaryote community, but they were correlated in time with seasonal lows in the abundances of ciliates (18S rRNA analysis). Laboratory exposure tests demonstrated that growth of the model ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis was inhibited by Microcystin-RR and Anabaenopeptin A at environmentally relevant concentrations in the ng/l-range, in natural lake water, synthetic freshwater, and growth media spiked with the cyanotoxins. Our findings suggest that even low concentrations (in the ng/l-range) of microcystins and anabaenopeptins, reduce growth of ciliates such as T. pyriformis and can be expected to have wider impacts on the eukaryote communities.

The effect of hapa placed in a tank-like structure made of canvas (hapa-canvas; HC) on the growth performance and survival of red tilapia larvae reared in Kenyir Lake was evaluated in wet and dry seasons compared to hapa without canvas as a control. The experiment was conducted for five weeks, and the stocking density of larvae in wet and dry seasons was 1500 larvae/m3 and 400 larvae/m(3), respectively. Larvae were fed with commercial powdered feed until satiation twice daily and sampled weekly. The final weight of larvae reared in HC in the wet (603.3 +/- 25.9 mg) and dry (1,308.7 +/- 60.7 mg) seasons were higher (p<0.05) than control (398.7 +/- 68.0 mg and 807.3 +/- 47.9 mg; respectively). The survival rate was also higher (p<0.05) in HC (68.6 +/- 7.3% and 87.7 +/- 1.7%) compared to control (7.3 +/- 1.0% and 74.8 +/- 0.3%) in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Thus, hapa-canvas may be a good alternative to rear tilapia larvae in an open water body based on its growth performance and survival rate.																			1511-3701	2231-8542				FEB	2025	48	2								10.47836/pjtas.48.2.06	http://dx.doi.org/10.47836/pjtas.48.2.06													WOS:001451283200004

However, the depth and systematic research on the formation mechanisms and influencing factors of zooplankton communities in mountain streams are poorly understood. Here, we conducted field sampling and investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of the zooplankton community structure and the major environmental factors in mountain streams to explore the principles underlying their effects on the zooplankton community. The results showed that zooplankton community structure exhibited significant seasonal variations. Rotifera and Cladocera were the dominant groups, with Rotifera dominant in warm weather and Cladocera dominant in February. The analysis revealed that temperature and trace elements are the main factors affecting zooplankton diversity. Our model explained 46.50% of the variation in zooplankton through temperature, water properties, nutrients, and trace elements. The results highlighted that temperature acted directly on the zooplankton community and also exhibited indirect and negative effects on zooplankton diversities through altering trace elements. Trace element variables had a significant impact on zooplankton community distribution. Our study systematically quantified these relationships, providing insights into the ecological processes of mountain streams and offering a scientific basis for the ecological protection of mountain streams.

J	Jing, YH; Niu, ZG				Jing, Yuhang; Niu, Zhenguo			High Spatiotemporal Resolution Monitoring of Water Body Dynamics in the Tibetan Plateau: An Innovative Method Based on Mixed Pixel Decomposition	SENSORS												The Tibetan Plateau, known as the "Third Pole" and the "Water Tower of Asia", has experienced significant changes in its surface water due to global warming. Accurately understanding and monitoring the spatiotemporal distribution of surface water is crucial for ecological conservation and the sustainable use of water resources. Among existing satellite data, the MODIS sensor stands out for its long time series and high temporal resolution, which make it advantageous for large-scale water body monitoring. However, its spatial resolution limitations hinder detailed monitoring. To address this, the present study proposes a dynamic endmember selection method based on phenological features, combined with mixed pixel decomposition techniques, to generate monthly water abundance maps of the Tibetan Plateau from 2000 to 2023. These maps precisely depict the interannual and seasonal variations in surface water, with an average accuracy of 95.3%. Compared to existing data products, the water abundance maps developed in this study provide better detail of surface water, while also benefiting from higher temporal resolution, enabling effective capture of dynamic water information. The dynamic monitoring of surface water on the Tibetan Plateau shows a year-on-year increase in water area, with an increasing fluctuation range. The surface water abundance products presented in this study not only provide more detailed information for the fine characterization of surface water but also offer a new technical approach and scientific basis for timely and accurate monitoring of surface water changes on the Tibetan Plateau.					niu, zhen guo/L-4829-2016; Niu, Zhenguo/L-4829-2016	niu, zhen guo/0000-0001-6125-730X; 														1424-8220				FEB	2025	25	4							1246	10.3390/s25041246	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s25041246								40006475					WOS:001431711700001

In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLYR), effective mitigation measures for IUU fishing are still absent, primarily due to gaps in prioritizing conservation actions and limited enforcement capabilities. In the present study, keywords associated with public concern, resource endowments and conservation efforts on online platforms were searched and analysed using the entropy-weighting method to identify major areas in the MLYR requiring immediate mitigation measures against IUU fishing. Key factors associated with the variation in public concern in these major areas were examined to discuss the feasibility of guiding actions against IUU fishing. From 2011 to 2023, public concern on IUU fishing were increasing, though the trend for recreational angling was not statistically significant. Following the implementation of the 'Ten-Year Fishing Ban' policy in Yangtze River, public concern on IUU fishing significantly increased. Changes in public concern were correlated with domestic human population, GDP, water area and the number of fishers. The results of entropy-weighting analysis highlighted the catchments of Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake as the major areas for reinforcing IUU fishing mitigation. In Poyang Lake, the areas requiring reinforced patrols and enforcement against IUU fishing include habitats around the river mouth of the Ganjiang River and central-eastern part of the lake during the flood season and the southern and eastern tributaries of the lake during the dry season. We recommend advancing the application of web-based data in biodiversity conservation and encouraging policy interventions to engage anglers as advocates for aquatic conservation, fostering a sound patrol network through social engagement.

J	Qu, XH; Xin, YF				Qu, Xiaohua; Xin, Yufeng			Detection and Health Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Upper Water of Nansi Lake, China	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Nansi Lake, China, has an economically valuable aquaculture industry but fish kills caused by heavy metal pollution have been problematic in recent years. Freshwater supply is critical for centers of industrial activity, commerce, and residences, but growing urban populations pollute the water they rely on. In the case of Nansi Lake, China, there are concerns that continuing urban growth is contributing to heavy metal pollution of the lake water, with potential economic and health impacts, but the extent of this pollution is unclear. To thoroughly understand the spatiotemporal characteristics of heavy metal pollution in Nansi Lake, China, we measured the concentrations of six heavy metals in upper water from 18 sites distributed across four sub-lakes of Nansi Lake and performed a health risk assessment over four seasons. The average concentrations of Pb, Cd, and Hg exceeded those of tertiary water quality standards and were 3.18-, 4.16-, and 14-fold higher than the values listed in the national surface water quality standard of China (GB3838-2002), respectively. Meanwhile, Cu, Mn, and Zn concentrations did not exceed the values in these standards. The heavy metals generally had consistent seasonal distribution patterns in different lake areas, but these patterns differed among the heavy metals, indicating that the metals may have different sources or transformation patterns. The full-year risk value of non-carcinogens in Nansi Lake was 2.32 x 10-6 a-1, which was lower than the maximum acceptable risk level (5 x 10-5 a-1) specified by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, implying that these was no harm to human health from these carcinogens. However, the full-year risk value of the carcinogen Cd was 22.54 x 10-5 a-1, which was much higher than the maximum acceptable level; this risk value contributed to 98.98% of the total risk and requires further attention.					xin, yufeng/GZB-1798-2022	xin, yufeng/0000-0002-1517-0673													0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2025	236	2							79	10.1007/s11270-024-07724-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-024-07724-y													WOS:001389415400001

Screening for virus resistance by subjecting cassava to high virus pressure in the epidemic zone (hotspots) is a common but lengthy process because of unpredictable and erratic virus infections requiring multiple seasons for disease evaluation. This study investigated the feasibility of graft-infections to provide a highly controlled infection process that is robust and reproducible to select and eliminate susceptible cassava at the early stages and to predict the resistance of adapted and economically valuable varieties. To achieve this, a collection of cassava germplasm from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a different set of breeding trials comprising two seed nurseries and one preliminary yield trial were established. The cassava varieties OBAMA and NAROCASS 1 infected with CBSD were planted one month after establishment of the main trials in a 50 m2 plot to serve as the source of the infection and to provide scions to graft approximately 1 ha. Grafted plants were inspected for virus symptoms and additionally tested by RT-qPCR for sensitive detection of the viruses. The incidence and severity of CBSD and cassava mosaic disease (CMD) symptoms were scored at different stages of plant growth and fresh root yield determined at harvesting. The results from the field experiments proved that graft-infection with infected plants showed rapid symptom development in susceptible cassava plants allowing instant exclusion of those lines from the next breeding cycle. High heritability, with values ranging from 0.63 to 0.97, was further recorded for leaf and root symptoms, respectively. Indeed, only a few cassava progenies were selected while clones DSC260 and two species of M. glaziovii (Glaziovii20210005 and Glaziovii20210006) showed resistance to CBSD. Taken together, grafting scions from infected cassava is a highly efficient and cost-effective method to infect cassava with CBSD even under rugged field conditions. It replaces an erratic infection process with a controlled method to ensure precise screening and selection for virus resistance. The clones identified as resistant could serve as elite donors for introgression, facilitating the transfer of resistance to CBSD.					; Dieng, Ibnou/F-1356-2016; Fowobaje, PhD, Kayode/AAC-2576-2021; Sheat, Samar/OGR-0839-2025; Fowobaje, Kayode/AAC-2576-2021	Sheat, Samar/0000-0002-5649-7795; Winter, Stephan/0000-0003-0309-9934; Sikirou, Mouritala/0000-0002-5164-6456; Fowobaje, Kayode/0000-0002-3995-160X														2073-4395				FEB	2025	15	2							425	10.3390/agronomy15020425	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy15020425													WOS:001429833100001

Management May Be Key to Conservation of an Iconic Old-Growth Stand in California, USA	FIRE-SWITZERLAND												Seasonally dry mature and old-growth (MOG) forests in the western USA face increasing threats from catastrophic wildfire and drought due to historical fire exclusion and climate change. The Emerald Point forest at Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada of California, one of the last remaining old-growth stands at lake level, is at high risk due to elevated fuels and tree densities. The stand supports huge trees and the highest tree diversity in the Lake Tahoe Basin and protects important raptor habitat. In this study, we simulate forest response to vegetation management and wildfire to assess the impacts of four fuel-reduction scenarios on fire behavior and stand resilience at Emerald Point. Results: Our results demonstrate that restorative forest management can greatly improve an MOG forest's resistance to catastrophic fire. Thinning to the natural range of variation for density, basal area, and fuel loads, followed by a prescribed burn, was most effective at reducing large-tree mortality, maintaining basal area, and retaining live tree carbon post-wildfire, while reducing secondary impacts. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the value of proactive management in protecting old-growth forests in seasonally dry regions from severe fire events, while also enhancing their ecological integrity and biodiversity.

Assessing inter-basin groundwater input to the Verlorenvlei estuarine lake using stable isotopes and hydrochemistry	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Verlorenvlei Catchment (-1 890 km2) is an agriculture-dominated area (-43 % per km2) on South Africa's west coast. This semi-arid region has variable rainfall and high evaporation rates, affecting the three major aquifers and Verlorenvlei - a RAMSAR-listed estuarine lake. Study focus: Natural processes (i.e., extended dry periods and evaporation) and anthropogenic activities (i.e., agricultural expansion and groundwater abstraction) have threatened Verlorenvlei's ecological functions. Seasonal and spatial changes between the water sources (i.e., direct rainfall, surface water, and groundwater) supporting Verlorenvlei were determined using 518O and 52H isotopes and hydrochemical analyses. Inter-basin aquifer contribution was investigated to assist in explaining Verlorenvlei's slow recovery since the recent 2015 - 2018 Western Cape drought. New insights: A proportion of groundwater from outside the topographic and surface- water delineated catchment supports Verlorenvlei during the dry month of April (i.e., G30F Langvlei sub-catchment). Furthermore, Verlorenvlei experiences high evaporation (evaporation best fit line: 52H = 12.49 x 518O-47.68, average 52H value of 47.1 %o and average 518O value of 7.64 %o) compared to its feeding rivers. Two sandstone and shale-dominated sub-catchments exhibit overlapping groundwater 518O and 52H values and water types to the sub-catchment in the nearest vicinity of Verlorenvlei, suggesting a disproportionately high groundwater contribution from these sub-catchments to Verlorenvlei. Evaluation of Verlorenvlei's water balance should consider both surface water and groundwater sources, particularly from inter-basin aquifer sources during prolonged droughts.																				2214-5818				FEB	2025	57								102081	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.102081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.102081													WOS:001372482800001

Thus, we present a new approach based on morphological, physical, chemical, elemental, and isotopic soil properties associated with charcoal data of a Brazilian palm swamp core (vereda) of Pleistocene age from the Parque Nacional de Brasilia. Principal Component Analysis was applied to soil properties to identify main factors and processes controlling the evolution of the studied environment, as well as to provide evidence of paleoenvironmental changes. The first three principal components indicated: PC1 - relative accumulation of organic matter versus local mineral material input (catchment stability); PC2 - peat decomposition processes; and PC3 - regional dust deposition. Sources of organic matter were inferred by delta 13C (C3 and C4 plants) and delta 15N (algae). And, charcoal allowed quantifying frequency and severity of fires, burned biomass, and predicting their origin. Our results show the environment has undergone transformations over the last 28,000 years, as follows: lake (before 27,750 years), swamp (27,750-19,311 cal years BP), marsh (19,311-13,405 cal years BP), and swamp again (last 13,405 cal years BP). In this latter stage, the open Cerrado was giving way to woody Cerrado. More arboreal vegetation went long-term expansion during moments of greater seasonality in early and mid-Holocene, and forest formations began their development. The last 1190 years marks the establishment of the current environmental conditions, with a gallery forest and palm-trees standing out from the canopy. The environmental stability increase occurred over time, providing low erosion since soil was becoming more covered by forest vegetation. Fires were recurrent since the Last Glacial Maximum and treated as of climatic origin, however anthropogenic origin has also contributed since the Holocene with the intensification of human activities. Our results indicate that integrating soil properties and charcoal can provide usefull tools for reconstitution studies of paleoenvironments and paleoclimates.					; Horák-Terra, Ingrid/G-8463-2012; de Camargo, Plínio/D-6635-2012	Horak-Terra, Ingrid/0000-0002-5078-5366; Barbosa de Camargo, Plinio/0000-0002-0696-3778													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2025	250								108760	10.1016/j.catena.2025.108760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2025.108760		JAN 2025											WOS:001420594200001

However, hypothesized explanations of their formation are based on weak evidence. To clarify the formation and maintenance mechanisms for these dunes, it's necessary to describe this landform's circulation. In this study, we measured the wind regime around a magadune-lake system from 2019 to 2021 to comprehensively characterize the terrain - driven circulation primarily induced by the roughness - disturbance impact exerted by the megadunes. The circulation generally disperses outward from the lake's center, and wind speed gradually increased from the megadune's bottom to its top. During the daytime, strong winds rise along the megadune's slope; at night, the megadune produces mountain winds and land winds, with downward airflow from the top of the megadune towards the center of the lake, but with low frequency and low wind speed. This creates a resultant drift direction (RDD) that is consistent between day and night, with both RDD pointing towards the megadune's top. RDD changes little between seasons, and is consistent with the annual RDD (from the megadune's bottom to its top). Two factors drive the circulation: First, the dune's height represents a roughness element that creates a deep convective boundary layer that triggers a strong ascending flow. Second, the flow is driven by differences in the thermal properties between the lake and the sand particles. Our results suggest that the terrain-driven circulation around megadune-lake systems flows from the dune's bottom to its top and explains the characteristics of the world's largest megadunes. Our work provides an empirical basis for a more comprehensive understanding of the formation and maintenance of the megadune-lake system.					shao, tianjie/AGK-6783-2022														0169-555X	1872-695X				MAR 15	2025	473								109633	10.1016/j.geomorph.2025.109633	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2025.109633		JAN 2025											WOS:001421142300001

Therefore, climate reconstructions from this region are valuable for our understanding of the temporal dynamics in the atmospheric circulation of the Southern Hemisphere. In this study a sedimentary record from the shallow lake Laguna Amalia - located in the semiarid Fuegian steppe of Tierra del Fuego (53 degrees S) - was used to study how the hydroclimate in this region has changed over the last similar to 7100 years. Our interpretations rely on a combination of pollen, diatoms, total organic carbon, carbonates, lithology and sediment accumulation rate, together with geomorphological features of the landscape. We conclude that before 6700 cal BP Laguna Amalia was a permanent water body. Around 6700 cal BP the climate becomes drier in response to stronger SWW, and from around 6000 cal BP the lake entered a semi-permanent state with variable salinity and prolonged drier periods. Between 3000 and 600 cal BP Laguna Amalia becomes a more permanent freshwater lake with only shorter periods with desiccation. For the last 600 years the climate has again become drier, and the lake is currently experiencing seasonal desiccation. These hydroclimatic changes can largely be attributed to the variable influence of the SWW, with weaker SWW allowing the advection of moist air masses from the east into northern Tierra del Fuego.

Effects of gastrointestinal parasites on fecal glucocorticoids and behaviour in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus)	PLOS ONE												Relationships between parasites, host physiology, and behaviours are complex. Parasites can influence host hormonal microenvironment and behaviour through "sickness behaviours" that generally conserve energy. Using a parasite removal experiment, we examined the effects of gastrointestinal parasites on fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGC) and behaviours of vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) at Lake Nabugabo, Uganda. We collected parasitological, hormonal, and behavioural data from adult and subadult male and female vervets (N = 19) in 2014 across four study phases: pre-deworming, post-deworming, early reinfection, and late reinfection as well as in 2015. Overall, there was no decrease in fGC after deworming, but there was an increase following natural reinfection. There was no change in feeding across study phases; however, moving, grooming, and resting changed between the post-deworming and late reinfection phases, but not always in the predicted direction. Comparing behaviour across the same months in the following year as in the 2014 experimental study period, we found no differences in moving, feeding, grooming, and resting events. Despite behavioural variation between study phases, we cannot conclude that behavioural changes are due to parasitism rather than other seasonal variation. However, fGC increased following reinfection, which is consistent with parasitism being costly for hosts.					; Chapman, Colin/S-1911-2019	Chapman, Colin/0000-0002-8827-8140; Upadhayay, Pooja/0009-0003-5653-9064													1932-6203					JAN 30	2025	20	1							e0316728	10.1371/journal.pone.0316728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316728								39883747					WOS:001447005000085

JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The annual flood pulse is a defining feature of Amazonian floodplain lakes, creating a highly variable environment that influences resource availability, such as food and habitat. These cyclical changes necessitate a high degree of adaptability among fish species, many of which have evolved specialized strategies to cope with the fluctuating conditions. In 2023, the Amazon basin experienced a record-breaking drought event, leading to mass mortality of Amazonian fish and other wildlife. This study examines the effect of this extreme event on fish condition in white-water (Rio Solim & otilde;es basin) and black-water (Rio Negro basin) floodplain lakes. These contrasting environments provide a unique opportunity to study how different water qualities and extreme water-level fluctuations impact fish condition. Research was conducted during the normal low-water period in November 2019 and the drastically decreased water levels in November 2023. The main objective was to understand how extreme water-level fluctuations affect fish health and nutritional status. A total of 585 fishes were analyzed, with 294 from white-water and 291 from black-water, representing different feeding types to provide a comprehensive picture of changes in fish condition. Water-level changes had a statistically significant impact on fish condition in both areas. Comparing low-water and extreme low-water levels, fish condition was consistently higher during the normal low-water period. The linear mixed-effects model revealed that the intensity of the low-water season had a significant effect on fish length-adjusted mass, suggesting that the decrease in water level is associated with an overall decrease in fish length-adjusted mass. When comparing the mean water-level effect (Glass's Delta) between low-water and extreme low-water levels, we found a bigger effect in the black-water system than in the white-water system. This difference may be attributed to the lower nutrient content and higher levels of humic acids and refractory dissolved organic matter in black-water, which can further limit primary productivity and food availability for fishes.

J	Erdogan, Ö; Karakas, B; Yünlü, MZ				Erdogan, Omer; Karakas, Busra; Yunlu, Melek Zeybek			The Trichoptera fauna of the Karpuz Stream and its relationships with water quality	BIOLOGIA												This study aims to evaluate the Trichoptera fauna of the Karpuz Stream in Antalya and its relationship with environmental factors. In the research, ten stations were selected to characterize the stream, and samples were collected seasonally. As a result of the study, a total of 20 Trichoptera taxa were identified, and the distribution of these species was correlated with dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and other physicochemical parameters. The findings revealed that dissolved oxygen is an important factor influencing Trichoptera diversity, with higher oxygen levels resulting in greater species diversity in upstream stations. The sensitivity of Trichoptera species to pH, temperature, and flow rate, particularly within the Hydropsychidae family, demonstrated their ability to adapt to different habitat conditions. Furthermore, the study determined that the first nine stations of the Karpuz Stream were classified as "oligosaprobic" (unpolluted water), while the tenth station was classified as "oligobetasaprobic" (slightly polluted water). This research provides valuable data on the ecological roles of Trichoptera species and the conservation of freshwater ecosystems in Turkey's Mediterranean basin. The study emphasizes the potential of Trichoptera species as bioindicators for water quality assessment and highlights their sensitivity to environmental changes. In this context, the preservation of Trichoptera fauna is critical for the sustainability of biodiversity and the effective management of water resources.

This study characterizes coated grains within a 25-m sediment core dating back to similar to 50 cal ka bp, assessing their significance through morphology, internal structures, mineralogy, and geochemistry. Coated grains in Urmia Lake exhibit concentric laminations, primarily calcite and aragonite, revealing alternating light carbonate-rich and dark organic-rich laminations. These reflect seasonal and long-term variations in water chemistry and biogenic production. Dry season algal blooms contribute to lamination, highlighting the interplay between seasonal climate fluctuations and the consequent lake water enrichment in calcium, carbonate, and bicarbonate ions. The diversity and abundance of coated grains indicate three main lake level fluctuation stages in the last similar to 50 cal ka: a lowering stage with dominant coated grains, a low lake level with dominant terrigenous fragments and minerals, and a high lake level with prominent Artemia urmiana fecal pellets. The role of the brine shrimp A. urmiana in coated grain formation involves absorbing calcium, carbonate, and bicarbonate ions and inhibiting coated grain formation during high lake levels while providing nuclei during lake lowering. An in-depth investigation of coated grains provides a chemical and biological formation framework, highlighting three main episodes in the lake's history. (c) 2025 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Lake Superior: Current conditions, trends, and emerging threats-Foreword to the special section	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Superior is one of the five Laurentian Great Lakes and the largest lake in the world by surface area. Lake Superior and its surrounding watershed support a wide range of species, provide a wealth of ecosystem services, and support a robust economy, much of which is reliant on the health of the ecosystem. Though Lake Superior continues to lead the other Laurentian Great Lakes in condition and quality, it has also undergone significant changes including chemical pollution, invasive species, and harmful algal blooms (HABs). The lake is also sensitive to climate change, with rapidly warming water temperatures, significant nutrient input from extreme storm events, and changes to habitat and food web structure, among other impacts. Understanding the current conditions, trends, and emerging threats to Lake Superior from local to ecosystem scales allows us to better manage the lake now and prepare for the future. This Journal of Great Lakes Research special section features a wide range of research, capturing the status of Lake Superior and providing insight to current and future stressors. Further, this issue includes results from the 2021 Lake Superior Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative field season and other collaborative efforts to better understand and protect Lake Superior.

Seasonal Variation in Responses of Largemouth Bass (Micropterus nigricans) Caught During Live-Release Angling Tournaments	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Traditional live-release tournament practices can influence habitat selection and cause displacement, stockpiling, and mortality. Tournaments are held in multiple seasons in a variety of environmental conditions, yet the seasonal influence on post-release behavior has rarely been studied. To quantify dispersal, habitat selection, and mortality of largemouth bass (Micropterus nigricans) caught in live-release tournaments in multiple seasons, movements of tournament-caught largemouth bass and non-angled controls implanted with acoustic telemetry tags were monitored from April-September for 2 months. Short-term stockpiling at the release point averaged 5-7 days and differed minimally among seasons. Mortality rates varied among seasons, in contrast, with nearly 12-fold higher mortality in late-season tournaments at higher water temperatures. If tournament pressure is intense enough, populations could be negatively impacted, thereby necessitating management actions to reduce tournament impacts over the longer term.

Eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic (DHA; 22:6 omega 3) fatty acids are physiologically crucial for consumers, and they must be either obtained from the diet or bioconverted from precursors. We monitored the synthesis of EPA and DHA by primary producers in the largest man-made ecosystem (Lake Kariba) and in situ fatty acid production, trophic transfer, and endogenous production of EPA and DHA in the tropical lake food web using 13C-labeling, compound-specific isotopes, and gene expression of fads2 and elovl5 genes in most abundant fish species. Seston pigment analysis and 23S rRNA sequencing revealed that cyanobacteria dominated primary producers throughout three seasons, and the biosynthesis rate of EPA and DHA was under the detection limit. Moreover, due to the low zooplankton densities and EPA and DHA content in zooplankton, the transfer of EPA and DHA from phytoplankton-zooplankton to upper trophic levels is low. The low production of EPA and DHA by primary producers is mitigated by bioconversion of alpha-linolenic acid to EPA and DHA in two tilapia species, especially by Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) known to feed on cyanobacteria. Compound-specific isotope analysis revealed that tigerfish (Hydrocynus vittatus), the main predatory fish on the lake, was more closely related to Nile tilapia than to lake planktivorous fish (Limnothrissa miodon). Therefore, trophic interaction between cyanobacteria and algivorous fish has replaced traditional phytoplankton and zooplankton trophic interaction in the synthesis and transfer of EPA and DHA to upper trophic levels.

Microbial activity contributes to the inactivation of waterborne enteric viruses, but while individual bacteria-virus interactions have been characterized, the importance of microbial diversity remains unknown. Here, we experimentally manipulated the diversity of bacterial communities from Lake Geneva across three seasons using a dilution-to-extinction approach and monitored the inactivation and genome decay of echovirus 11, a member of the Enterovirus genus. Long-read sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed diversity gradients ranging between 373 and 2,722 bacterial species. Compared to sterile controls, echovirus 11 inactivation was enhanced by the presence of active bacteria and depended both on season and sample dilution. Throughout all seasons, the highest inactivation (between 3.0 and 7.9 log10 fold reduction in infectivity over 96 h) was observed in the least diluted incubations (i.e., the highest bacterial richness). Genome decay exhibited a 24-h lag and was less pronounced than the corresponding infectivity loss (ranging between 2.3 and 3.8 log10 fold over 96 h), indicating that microbial inactivation primarily targets the echovirus 11 capsid. We found a positive-saturating relationship between bacterial species richness and viral inactivation, suggesting functional redundancy and pointing toward the importance of rare species for viral inactivation. Biomarker analysis revealed several clades of bacteria, particularly members of Chitinophagaceae, to be significantly associated with echovirus 11 inactivation. Overall, these findings suggest that high microbial diversity enhances the capacity of surface waters to rid themselves of contamination by enteric viruses and hence protects public health.

The study investigates the impact of lagoon exchange through the Tinja channel, including the influence of tides, as well as the effects of river inflows and precipitation in controlling salinity and preventing drought occurrences in Ichkeul Lake using a numerical approach. Regarding the remote sensing analysis, findings show that the water body area of Ichkeul Lake has experienced a marked decline over recent years. Specifically, the area decreased from 31.4 km2 in 2016 to 29.7 km2 in 2022, highlighting ongoing environmental changes. A broader analysis spanning from 2000-2022 reveals a dramatic reduction, with the water body shrinking from 72.33 km2 in 2000 to 29.7 km2 in 2022, amounting to a substantial loss of 42.63 km2 over two decades. As for the results of the numerical model, the results highlight the importance of tides in controlling the waterflow and salt into the lake. The flow of water exchanged across this communication ranges from-0.2 mm/day to + 0.2 mm/day, exhibiting variations corresponding to the different seasons. Furthermore, the simulations demonstrate the consequences of the closure of the Tinja channel. The numerical experiment shows that after 560 days of "isolation", the Ichkeul lake experienced a total drought. The research findings underscore the critical significance of maintaining lagoon connectivity through the Tinja channel, considering both river input and tidal influence, to control salinity levels and prevent drought events in the Ichkeul Lake.					; Rebai, Noamen/AAI-4922-2020	SEBEI, Abdelaziz/0000-0002-8263-9590; Belhadj, Cyrine/0000-0003-3255-1619													2352-4855					FEB	2025	82								103986	10.1016/j.rsma.2024.103986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2024.103986		JAN 2025											WOS:001401932500001

Research is needed to investigate the influence of ambient air pollution and built and social environments on SI and cognitive decline among rural, disadvantaged, ethnic minority communities. To address this gap, this cohort study will recruit an ethnoracially diverse, rural Florida sample in geographic proximity to seasonal agricultural burning. We will (1) examine contributions of smoke-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposures to SI and cognitive function; (2) determine effects of built and social environments on SI and cognitive function; and (3) contextualize SI and cognitive function among residents from different ethnoracial groups during burn and non-burn seasons.Methods We will recruit 1,087 community-dwelling, dementia-free, >= 45-year-olds from five communities in Florida's Lake Okeechobee region. Over 36 months, participants will complete baseline visits to collect demographics, health history, and health measurements (e.g., blood pressure, body mass index) and 6-month follow-ups assessing cognitive function and social isolation at each visit. A subsample of 120 participants representative of each community will wear smartwatches to collect sensor data (e.g., heart rate) and daily routine and predefined activities (e.g., GPS-captured travel, frequent destinations) over two months. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) (e.g., whether smoke has bothered participant in last 30 minutes) will occur over two months during agricultural burning and non-burning months. PurpleAir monitors (36 total) will be installed in each community to continuously monitor outdoor PM2.5 levels.Discussion We expect to identify individual- and community-level factors that increase the risk for SI and cognitive decline in a vulnerable rural population.

J	Sandhya, P; Shreyaas, K; Jayaraj, R; Rajeswari, GR				Sandhya, P.; Shreyaas, K.; Jayaraj, R.; Rajeswari, Ganesh Raja			Detection and classification of unwanted plants and plastics present in aquatic bodies for recycling	MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												PurposeOne of the major challenges faced by the world at present is management and treatment of waste. Especially, waste such as polyethylene (plastics) is non-degradable and is causing great damage to our environment. Aquatic environment is one among them that is getting affected by these plastic wastes. Water pollution is a great issue faced in many countries and steps to reduce it are being taken on a wide scale. Unwanted aquatic plants grown in ponds and lakes create problems like totally covering up the surface of the lake that blocks the sunlight for aquatic species and also reducing their total storage. Identifying such unwanted plants and plastics is a very essential part in treating and management of waste. Detection and classification help us to achieve this. With the help of satellites, drone-shot images of many oceans are captured, and the amount of plastic content present is detected using artificial intelligence. In artificial intelligence, we have many algorithms and platforms that help us to achieve object detection. Tensorflow is one such framework that helps us to perform object detection with the help of pre-trained models present in it, and thus, it is used in this study. Object detection uses computer vision to detect objects from images. Convolutional neural networks are a subset of machine learning that is helpful in image processing - in other words, processing of pixel data. In this study, we used the ResNet-50 model involving transfer learning for classifying unwanted plants and plastics. Lakes and ponds are the major places among the other aquatic environments where these kinds of wastes are found, and therefore, this study concentrates on waste present in these aquatic bodies. The lakes and ponds present near residential areas act as a place for storing excess rainwater, which prevents flooding. Many cities, especially residential areas, face a lot of water stagnation problems during the rainy season. Ponds and lakes near these areas contain unwanted plants and plastics present, which makes it a problem to store the rainwater that comes during monsoon. Another problem is that they don't provide sunlight to enter deep into water, making the aquatic species difficult to survive. Preserving and maintaining such lakes from getting filled with non-degradable plastics and unwanted plant growth becomes very important. Therefore, the lakes and ponds present in such residential areas would be useful to detect the unwanted waste.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, the focus is on detection and classification of the plastics and unwanted plants. The dataset is very important for this study, which is an image dataset. There was not any readily available image data of unwanted plastics available online, and therefore, the images were captured from the lakes and ponds in Kanchipuram district. Images of duckweed, plastics, bulrush and leaves of sky lotus were taken. This dataset consisted a total of 200 images, with 50 images belonging to each category. Having this as the dataset, detection and classification were carried out.FindingsThe object detection took place for the plastic, duckweed, bulrush and leaves of sky lotus and the performance metrics such as precision and recall was evaluated to test the accuracy of the detections. Precision is used to calculate the number of correctly identified positive identifications. This is done by dividing the sum of true positives and false positives from the number of true positives. True positives are nothing but the number of correct predictions of positive identifications, and false positives are the number of false predictions of positive identifications. Similarly, recall is used to calculate the number of actual positives identified. We can calculate recall by dividing the sum of true positives and false negatives from the total number of true positives. Here false negatives are the number of false predictions of false identification. This performance metrics was evaluated for the trained model, and we obtained an average precision of 0.81 and an average recall of 0.86. The high precision and recall values of our model show that the model produces accurate results. Therefore, the model is producing good performance in detecting the unwanted plants and plastics from lakes and ponds. The evaluation results were visualized with the help of TensorBoard and are available in fig-4 and fig-5. The loss rate is visualized and is available in fig-6. We can see that the loss rate has reduced over the steps as we pass from 1,000 to 4000th step.Originality/valueThe work was originally carried out in the Kanchipuram district of Tamil Nadu.

Effective monitoring of DAWs is crucial for environmental management. Few methods can efficiently extract DAWs in complex landcover environments due to high model complexity and large parameter sizes, with most studies focusing on 2m resolution GF2 imagery and limited research exploring higher-resolution data for DAWs detection. To address these limitations, this study optimizes both the input data and model architecture. A new feature set, ASGI, which combines CIE color features-hue angle (alpha), slope (S), and green index (GI)-was developed to enhance the differentiation between DAWs and other land cover types. Two datasets, comprising 7825 images (512 x 512 pixels) from high-resolution (0.25m) remote sensing data, were constructed using both RGB and ASGI features. A lightweight SEM-Unet model was then proposed, demonstrating high-precision recognition in complex land cover backgrounds. The inclusion of the scSE attention module within the MobileNetV2-Unet architecture further improved segmentation performance. Additionally, the use of DropPath regularization combined with DiceLoss and Focal Loss significantly enhanced the model's generalization capability and addressed class imbalance. Experimental results show that using ASGI as input data significantly improved accuracy (83.97%) and F1 score (81.95%). Compared to existing models, SEM-Unet achieved excellent recognition performance while maintaining a compact size (15.4 MB). The SEM-Unet model was validated in the eutrophic Haihe River basin for DAWs extraction and BOW detection, achieving an overall accuracy of 85.11%. With a false positive rate of 27.27% and a false negative rate of 4%, the model demonstrated strong generalization ability and practical applicability across different areas. These results suggest that SEM-Unet has the potential for largescale, efficient remote sensing monitoring of DAWs, and can also provide a remote sensing detection method for BOW in eutrophic or organic-rich basins, demonstrating significant potential for broader applications.

J	Dhanush, S; Priya, MG				Dhanush, S.; Priya, M. Geetha			Chronicles of Glacier Changes of Two Decades in Tons Sub-Basin, West-Central Himalaya, Using Geospatial Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												This study investigates the historical extent and dynamics of glaciers in the Tons sub-basin, a key glacier-fed region located in the western part of the Indian Himalayas. The Tons sub-basin is crucial for regional water supply, feeding major tributaries of the Yamuna River. Using Landsat 7, 8, and 9 satellite imagery from three distinct periods 2002-2003, 2012-2013, and 2022-2023 we applied a laminar flow model to quantify changes in glacier morphology and dynamics over two decades. Our analysis reveals a significant reduction in glacial area by 17.5%, perimeter by 20.2%, and volume by 18.9%. Glacial thickness has diminished by a factor of 0.9 during this period, with the most substantial retreat observed between 2002-2003 and 2022-2023. The volume loss is estimated at 1.34 cubic kilometers. These changes indicate a marked acceleration in glacier retreat, likely driven by increasing regional temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. The implications of these findings are significant, as the retreat of glaciers in the Tons sub-basin threatens water availability in downstream communities, alters seasonal hydrology, and increases the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Our study provides critical insights into the ongoing impacts of climate change on Himalayan glaciers, which are vital for informing water resource management and climate adaptation strategies in the region.

Based on 3 elements, spectral-temporal characterization, classification, and degradation detection for wetland covers, this study proposes a continuous classification and degradation detection algorithm for alpine wetlands (AW-CCD). This algorithm relates to water-related landscape change processes, including multiscenario detection of snowmelt, lake, and river shrinkage and the transition of a swampy meadow to an alpine meadow with decreased soil wetness. AW-CCD uses the spectral-temporal index features to classify wetlands on an annual basis and then capture wetland degradation processes to combine long-time-series inter-annual parameters and seasonal soil wetness. This study detected snow cover from clouds based on the Landsat Quality Assessment band and spectral changes during snow-bare rock transition. Through the meadow spectral ratio vegetation index and seasonal soil wetness frequency across years, swampy and alpine meadow dynamics are tracked by wetness loss and increasing grass signal. By effectively characterizing multiple surface changes through spectral-temporal analysis, AW-CCD provides annual wetland mapping and monitoring metrics for multiscenario degradation. Results show an improvement in snow and meadow mapping accuracy by 5% and 3%, respectively, with a mapping accuracy of 94.9% in the Maidika Wetland in 2022. Spatial-temporal patterns demonstrated multiscenario degradation during 2 decades, with snow and river areas decreasing by 5.04% and 16.74%, respectively, and 3.23% of swampy meadows transitioning to alpine meadows. Degradation was most pronounced before 2009, followed by stability until 2015 and renewed degradation thereafter. This study highlights the effectiveness of AW-CCD in capturing the multiscenario responses of alpine wetlands to climatic changes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

J	Zhang, XY; Yun, X; Huang, Y; Shen, GF; Lin, N				Zhang, Xinyang; Yun, Xiao; Huang, Ye; Shen, Guofeng; Lin, Nan			Accounting for microorganisms yields stricter water quality criteria and elevated ecological risks of antibiotics: A case study of sulfonamides in the Yangtze River Delta	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The derivation of water quality criteria (WQC) for antibiotics is influenced by the inclusion of various organisms' toxicity data, including microbial data, though no definitive conclusions have been reached. This study focuses on sulfonamide antibiotics, common in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), to assess the influences of different organisms' toxicity data on determining WQCs and subsequent evaluation of ecological risks. A total of 263 toxicity data points from eight sulfonamides, including sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and sulfamethazine (SM2), were selected to derive WQCs using Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) methods. Three WQC types were calculated: based on native species (WQC-n), a combination of native and non-native species (WQC-nn), and a combination of species and microorganisms (WQC-nnm). While WQC-nn showed minimal differences from WQC-n, the inclusion of microbial data resulted in more conservative short-term WQCs (SWQC-nnm), calculated as 256.90 mu g/L for SMX and 196.09 mu g/L for SM2, approximately half of SWQC-nn values (435.20 mu g/L for SMX and 491.11 mu g/L for SM2). Monitoring data from the past 15 years in the YRD revealed a 133 % increase in ecological risks when using LWQC-nnm compared to LWQC-n and LWQC-nn, particularly under the worst-case pollution scenarios. However, there was a slight temporal decline in overall ecological risks. The study concludes that incorporating microbial toxicity data results in more protective WQCs and underscores the need for further research to develop WQCs that safeguard sensitive organisms and better reflect real-world exposure scenarios, e.g., the mixture exposure.					zhang, xinyang/IVH-4215-2023; SHEN, Guofeng/F-3163-2015; Lin, Nan/ABC-2114-2020	SHEN, Guofeng/0000-0002-7731-5399; Yun, Xiao/0000-0002-1062-1244													0147-6513	1090-2414				JAN 1	2025	289								117650	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117650	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117650		JAN 2025						39752909					WOS:001397397100001

Seasonalsurveys in 2023 recorded 46 algal taxa, including 37 first regional records, across ten rivers spanning contrasting hydrochemical environments. Heterokontophyta dominated (69.6% of taxa), with epilithic and benthic habitats supporting the highest diversity. Simpson's Dominance Index (0.120-0.131) and saprobic index (0.69-0.89) indicated high diversity and predominantly oligosaprobic to beta-mesosaprobic conditions, reflecting mostly unpolluted, well-oxygenated waters. Principal Component Analysis identified mineralization (sulfate, calcium, TDS) and nutrient gradients as key drivers of algal community structure. Sensitive diatoms such as Fragilaria capucina and Achnanthidium minutissimum dominated pristine sites, while tolerant taxa like Gomphonema parvulum and Nitzschia palea increased under moderate enrichment. These findings establish a regional reference for algal-based biomonitoring, highlightthe vulnerability of semi-arid stream ecosystems to environmental change, and provide essential baseline data for conservation planning, future monitoring, and ecosystem management in the South Caucasus and comparable dryland regions.

Length-weight relationship, relative condition factor and reproductive parameters of Mystus cavasius (Hamilton, 1822) in the river Ganga	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: In this study, length-weight relationship, relative condition factor, sex ratio, gonadosomatic index, and size at first maturity of Mystus cavasius were determined in the tropical river Ganga, India. Methodology: Fish sampling was carried out monthly, and 562 specimens were collected from three landing sites of River Ganga. Total length and body weight were measured using a digital Vernier caliper (Insize-0/150) and digital weighing balance (Wensar MAB-220). Results: In the length-weight relationship, the exponent values for male, female, and combined sexes are 2.8547, 2.8166, and 2.8569, respectively. The mean relative condition factor of male and female were 1.00 +/- 0.08 and 1.02 +/- 0.11, respectively. The overall sex ratio of the species is 1: 1.50, indicating predominance of female (Chi. Square value = 21.53, p<0.05). The species have a prolonged spawning season from June to October, peaking in August. Interpretation: In stock assessment studies, length-weight relationships provide useful information for estimating growth parameters, assessing population structure, developing yield equations, and comparing populations over time and space. Size at first maturity will be useful for setup of minimum legal mesh size of fishing gears to protect juvenile and recruitment overfishing for conservation of spawners and spawning biomass.

J	Alrashada, YN; Mathew, RT				Alrashada, Yousof Naser; Mathew, Roshmon Thomas			Spatio-temporal variation of zooplankton community in AlAsfar Lake, Saudi Arabia	MAEJO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Zooplankton diversity serves as a widely utilised ecological indicator of aquatic ecosystems due to the plankton's capacity to promptly adapt to environmental alterations. This study investigates the influence of environmental factors on zooplankton diversity in AlAsfar Lake, Saudi Arabia. Zooplankton and water samples were seasonally collected from three distinct locations in the lake at different depths: station 1 (intermediate), station 2 (deep) and station 3 (shallow). A total of 39 zooplankton species were identified, comprising 16 Rotifera, 8 Cladocera, 8 Copepoda and 7 Ostracoda. The abundance of Rotifera was found to be highest at 88%, followed by Ostracoda at 6%, Cladocera at 4% and Copepoda at 2%. There was a notable difference in the average density of the zooplankton across seasons and study sites. The total density of zooplankton species showed positive correlations with salinity, chlorophyll a, temperature and transparency while negative correlations were observed with pH, dissolved oxygen, silicates, phosphate, total dissolved solids, nitrate and conductivity. Station 2 had the highest average density of zooplankton while station 3 had the lowest. The ecological status, as determined by various hydrological parameters, indicates that the stations under investigation exhibit either eutrophic or hypereutrophic characteristics. These findings indicate that the discharge of sewage and other domestic pollutants into the lake may lead to a decline in zooplankton diversity.

Cloud seeding was conducted from April 1 to 29, 2021, during the transition of rainy and dry seasons. The Piper-Cheyenne aircraft equipped with CoSAT-1000 hygroscopic flares departed Silangit Airport for the daily seeding missions. The seed clouds are selected carefully to meet seeding criteria using radar monitoring. Evaluation of activity results using rainfall data taken from GSMaP data using the Target Only Statistical Method. Actual and historical rainfall data (2001-2020) are taken from GSMaP data. According to this study, precipitation has increased by 36.3%. The spatial distribution of rainfall demonstrates an upward trend, with greater values observed in the eastern region of Lake Toba. Cloud seeding has also increased Lake Toba's level by 8.5 cm. In addition, it has also produced an additional inflow of 5.29 m3/second, equivalent to a water volume of 13,254,624 m3, comparable to 15,905,548.80 kWh. It is hoped that the outcomes of this work will help provide food and energy security by supplying water to dams in Indonesia.

The objective is to identify differences between networks under distinct conditions. We conduct node-level screening to assess whether node-conditional distributions differ across conditions. These distributions are modeled using Poisson generalized linear models, and equality is tested via likelihood ratio tests, ensuring false discovery rate control across nodes. Through a simulation study, we show that our approach has a strong performance in accurately identifying differences while maintaining false discovery rate control. Finally, we apply the method to analyze variations in the basketball statistics of the two NBA finalist teams from the 2009-2010 season: the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics.

Recent studies have identified several species within this complex, including Hoplias argentinensis (the southernmost species), but no precise biological knowledge exist for it. In the present work, the reproductive biology of H. argentinensis was studied in the shallow lake Kakel Huincul (Buenos Aires, Argentina), between May 2022 and May 2023. Five ovarian maturation phases were macroscopic and histologically characterized and four ovarian maturation phases were detected: immature, developing, spawning capable (including active spawning subphase) and regressing. The results suggest a reproductive season from May to February, with a spawning season from October to February. Batch fecundity varied between 24,342 and 77,866 oocytes. The relative fecundity ranged between 12 and 67 oocytes/g ovary. Histological analysis and frequency distribution of oocyte diameters in actively spawning females revealed a tetramodal pattern characterizing H. argentinensis as an iteroparous batch spawner with indeterminate fecundity. These results provide a better understanding of the reproductive life cycle of this newly described species at its southernmost occurrence. This study also provides the first histologic description of the maturation ovarian phases and oocyte development stages in an annual cycle.

J	Çeleklí, A; Gümüs, EY; Çetín, T				Celekli, Abuzer; Gumus, Emine Yonca; Cetin, Tolga			Ecological assessment of lentic ecosystems in Ceyhan River Basin using phytoplankton indices	TURKISH JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Increasing exploitation of water resources has led to declining water quality in aquatic environments. Freshwater ecosystems face various environmental pressures, such as the impacts of climate change and intensifying land-use practices. This study aimed to assess the ecological preferences of phytoplankton communities and determine the ecological status (ES) of several reservoirs and lakes in Ceyhan River Basin across different seasons. A canonical correspondence analysis was conducted to understand the associations between phytoplankton assemblages and stressors in freshwater ecosystems, revealing a strong correlation of 97%. The factors that most influenced the distribution of phytoplankton species were electrical conductivity (EC), temperature, total phosphorus, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and altitude. High values of EC, BOD5, and nutrients were recorded in Hakk & imath;beyli Reservoir. Among the studied ecosystems, only Hakk & imath;beyli Reservoir exhibited a TN:TP ratio greater than 29:1, which corresponded to the highest cyanobacterial biovolume observed. The bioassessment study indicated that the MPTI-modified phytoplankton trophic index fit well to the logTP gradient, whereas Phyto-Tr did not. The MPTI revealed that the lakes and reservoirs had a moderate ES. The MPTI may provide more accurate assessments of the ES of lakes and reservoirs in Ceyhan River Basin. The results highlight the importance of understanding how different phytoplankton species respond to environmental factors across diverse ecosystems. Such insights are crucial for assessing the ecological condition of standing water ecosystems and provide essential information for their management and conservation.

There was a lack of information on Odonata of Lake Cluster of Pokhara Valley (LCPV), one of the vital Ramsar sites in Nepal. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diversity of Odonata and monthly variations in diversity in the three lakes (Maidi, Gunde, and Kamalpokhari) of LCPV. Odonates were sampled by the direct observation method along the transects laid on the existing trails around the lakes (three transects in each). A total of 27 species of Odonata from six families were documented. Of these, 15 were Anisoptera (dragonfly) and 12 were Zygoptera (damselfly). Species richness and abundance were the highest in Maidi and lowest in Kamalpokhari. However, there was no statistically significant difference in species richness and Shannon and Simpson's diversities between the lakes, showing similarities in odonates' community composition. Libellulidae and Coenagrionidae were the three lakes' most diverse and abundant families. Shannon and Simpson's diversities significantly differed between families in all lakes. September and November have the highest diversity and abundance. A significant difference in Odonata composition was found between the months. This research provides valuable insights into Odonata's diversity at a Ramsar site in Nepal and underscores the potential for further ecological research and conservation efforts.					; Miya, Mahamad Sayab/AEA-3728-2022	Miya, Mahamad Sayab/0000-0002-1675-593X; 													0033-2615	1687-7438					2025	2025	1							9368532	10.1155/psyc/9368532	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/psyc/9368532													WOS:001446973600001

The results indicated that the life history of C. nasus is complex and diverse, the individuals in this study can be categorized into five distinct patterns. Pattern I includes P1, P2, P3, and P4, whose life history tracks indicate hatching in brackish water near the Yellow River estuary; after approximately 1 year, they begin to migrate along the Yellow River to Pangkou Bay for spawning. Pattern II encompasses P9, P12, and P13, which hatch in freshwater habitats; as these individuals grow, there is an abrupt change from Stage 1 to Stage 2, but their life history does not extend to marine habitats with high Sr/Ca values, and after about 1 year, they migrate along the Yellow River to Pangkou Bay for spawning. Pattern III includes P6, P8 and P10, which also hatch in freshwater habitats and experience abrupt changes; however, the mapping analysis reveals a large area of red and yellow concentric rings, indicating a history of seawater habitat and an extension of their life history to Laizhou Bay. Pattern IV is represented by P11, whose living environment was relatively stable, with no significant abrupt changes and no migratory life history characteristic, which presumed to be a freshwater settlement type that passively entered the Yellow River due to the flood season of Dongping Lake. Pattern V is exemplified by P7, whose analysis results show two trips to freshwater and brackish water habitats, both of which produced significant pattern changes which indicates that it conducted a reproductive migration at the first instar, swam to the Yellow River estuary after spawning, and migrated to Pangkou during the reproductive period of the following year to lay eggs until it was captured. This study demonstrates that most individuals in Pangkou Bay are of the migratory type. Compared with the sexual maturity of individuals in other waters of the Yangtze River basin, Pangkou Bay is identified as an important spawning ground for the migratory type of C. nasus.

Preferences are examined through Q-methodology, with statements generated based on relevant literature. In the study, two distinct samples are employed with 49 consumers from Lake Balaton and 33 consumers from Greater Budapest. These samples are also subjects of a comparative analysis. The research identifies five consumer preference groups (factors) for Lake Balaton and four factors for Greater Budapest. Consumers demonstrate an overall interest in trying local food specialities, primarily driven by a desire to immerse themselves in the food culture of the destinations. The factors exhibit a relatively low commitment to choosing environmentally sustainable restaurants, while consumers aim to support local businesses and job creation. Comparatively, consumers at Lake Balaton place a higher value on local wine offerings, while they consider the food in Greater Budapest's restaurants to be more unique. This study provides information based on Qmethodology research results regarding consumer preferences, offering advice to restaurants on customising their offerings for diverse consumer groups.																			1994-7658	1314-0817					2025	40								4004	10.54055/ejtr.v40i.3608	http://dx.doi.org/10.54055/ejtr.v40i.3608													WOS:001512562000013

This filter effect may be more severe for soil than canopy fauna. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the patterns of species occurrence, richness and composition of soil and canopy ants in forest and lake-swamp ecotones in a tropical river basin. We established two transects (250 m) at each site, one placed in the ecotone (i.e., flood zone) and the other inside the adjacent forest. Although upper and lower river basin had totally different ant species composition, the species occurrence, richness and composition distribution between habitats followed a similar pattern for both altitudes. Occurrence of soil ants and species richness was similar between interior and ecotone. The occurrence and species richness of canopy ants were both higher in the ecotones than in the forest interior. Ant species composition was similar between the ecotone and adjacent forest, for both soil and canopy fauna, and the ant species composition was different between seasons (dry and rainy) and between canopy and soil fauna. Most importantly, the environmental filter imposed by the ecotone and its unpredictable habitat conditions favoured fewer but opportunistic species, which drove the higher occurrence in these habitats. The years we studied were particularly dry and had a substantial decrease in lake depth. Hence, the abilities of species to best use unpredictable resources from the natural succession on the new dry grounds might have been defined by omnivorous, opportunistic and numerically dominant ants. The abiotic particularities of forest-water ecotones are important in the temporal dynamics of ant species assemblages. Fluctuations in water dynamics can restrict soil assemblages, but subtle changes in soil flooding also affect canopy fauna and can have unpredictable effects due to intensified variations in seasonal dynamics.					; Ribeiro, Sérvio/G-1887-2012; Lourenço, Giselle/AAF-9191-2019	Brito de Almeida, Maria Fernanda/0000-0002-5633-3504; 													1442-9985	1442-9993				JAN	2025	50	1							e70021	10.1111/aec.70021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.70021													WOS:001393005600001

Three scenarios were established with different levels of floating macrophyte cover: scenario 1 (similar to 90% visibility of the water surface, in December/2013), scenario 2 (similar to 50% of the water surface covered with macrophytes, in March/2014), scenario 3 (similar to 80% of the water surface covered with macrophytes, in September/2014). Phytoplankton, chlorophyll-a and limnological data were collected at three points and three depths in the reservoir. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in physico-chemical and biological factors between the scenarios, influenced by seasonality and the colonization of macrophytes. In scenario 1, the reservoir was mesotrophic, deep and transparent, with high salinity and total dissolved solids, dominated by planktonic species. In scenario 2, eutrophication was present, with a higher concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen due to the rains, and the presence of planktonic and benthic species associated with the microhabitats formed by the macrophytes. In scenario 3, shallow and dominated by macrophytes, benthic and shade-adapted species were prevalent, reflecting high turbidity and the presence of high iron. The Species Indication Value approach proved effective (71.2%), highlighting the influence of turbidity, potassium, magnesium, salinity and precipitation on phytoplankton structure. The study recommends the continued use of phytoplankton as a bioindicator in future research, strengthening its role in the ecological assessment of Amazonian aquatic environments.																			1676-0603	1676-0611					2025	25	2							e20241698	10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2024-1698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2024-1698													WOS:001523069200001

Phytoplankton functional group dynamics and environmental drivers in a tropical monomictic lake (Lake Yambo, Philippines)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Tropical monomictic lakes, characterized by a single annual mixing event and prolonged stratification, are particularly sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Lake Yambo, a tropical monomictic lake in the Philippines, exemplifies such systems, with stratification prevailing during the southwest monsoon and full lake mixing occurring during the northeast monsoon. This study examined vertical and seasonal variations in environmental conditions and phytoplankton functional group composition in Lake Yambo to assess how seasonal stratification and mixing affect functional groups' vertical structure. Monthly sampling from March 2024 to February 2025 was conducted from the subsurface to 30 meters at 5-meter intervals. In situ measurements of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and nitrate (NO3-) were obtained using multiparameter probes, while chlorophyll-a, ammonia, and total phosphorus were analyzed in the laboratory. Phytoplankton samples were collected, identified, and counted, with species comprising at least 5% of the total phytoplankton biomass per period classified into their respective functional groups. Lake Yambo exhibited meso-eutrophic conditions characterized by high total phosphorus concentrations but comparatively low chlorophyll-a levels, suggesting that phytoplankton growth is likely limited by nitrogen availability. Seasonal patterns governed thermal stratification and mixing, which, in turn, regulated vertical nutrient gradients. Stratified conditions during the southwest monsoon led to nutrient trapping and hypolimnetic anoxia, while northeast monsoon mixing redistributed nutrients, particularly NO3-. These transitions strongly influenced the functional group composition. Seven dominant functional groups (B, F, G, H1, J, LO, and P) comprised 81% to 97% of the total phytoplankton biomass. Most functional groups declined with depth, but seasonal and vertical variations were distinct: Group G and H1 thrived in warmer surface waters with low nitrate concentrations. Groups J and LOwere associated with cooler, nitrate-enriched surface layers during peak mixing, while Groups B, F, and P were more abundant at deeper layers under the same conditions. These findings support the hypothesis that seasonally driven stratification and mixing in tropical monomictic lakes structure vertical nutrient availability and shape phytoplankton functional group dynamics. Notably, the bloom of Group H1 during post-peak mixing under extreme nitrogen limitation and elevated temperatures poses a health risk, as this group's descriptor taxon, Dolichospermum, can produce cyanotoxins. Thus, tropical monomictic lakes experiencing greater eutrophication may face increased risks of these toxic blooms. As a representative tropical monomictic system, Lake Yambo offers valuable insights into how similar systems respond to seasonal mixing and nutrient limitations, providing a framework for understanding and managing ecological risks in these environments.

Investigation of a NOx emission from coal power plants in Texas, United States and its impact on the environment	CHINA GEOLOGY												Texas is the largest state by area in the US after Alaska, and one of the top states in the production and consumption of electricity with many coal-fired plants. Coal-fired power plants emit greater than 70% of pollutants in the energy sector. When coal is burned to produce electricity, nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the air, one of the main pollutants that threaten human health and lead to a large number of premature deaths. The key to effective air quality management is the strict compliance of all plants with emission standards. However, not all Texas coal plants have the environmental equipment to lower pollutant emissions. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) were used to evaluate the emissions for Texas power plants. Data from both the Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (EGRID) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) were used to examine emissions. It was found that NOxemissions for Texas power plants range from 1.53 kt/year to 10.99 kt/year, with the Martin Lake, Limestone and Fayette Power Project stations being the top emitters. WA Parish and Martin Lake stations have the strongest NOx fluxes, with both exhibiting significant seasonal variability. Comparisons of bottom-up inventories for EDGAR and EGRID show a high correlation (r=0.956) and a low root mean square error (0.766). A more reasonable control policy would lead to much reduced NOxemissions.

J	Findik, B				Findik, Betul			Human Traces in Burdur Elmacık Fossil Locality	OLBA												This article presents analyses of Paleolithic lithic artefacts discovered at the Elmacik vertebrate fossil site near the village of Elmacik in the Kemer district of the Burdur province. Rescue excavations were carried out in the Elmacik fossil site, which formed the shores of the Burdur pluvial lake during the Late Early Pleistocene, over four seasons between 2006 and 2009 and one season in 2016. The vertebrate fossils obtained from the excavations have been dated to the Late Early Pleistocene (approximately 1.2-1.1 million years ago). Taphonomic analyses were conducted on the fossils, now exhibited at the Burdur Natural History Museum, with evidence of butchery marks observed on some of the specimens. These marks indicate that the age of the chipped stone artifacts aligns with the fossil age, pointing to the earliest human presence in Burdur during the Late Early Pleistocene. During this period, when Lake Burdur was a freshwater source, the lakeshore appears to have served as an important habitat for both animals and humans. The lithic artefacts support this view. The 54 lithics were found scattered over a wide area. It is thought that the cementation and burial-prone nature of the area made it difficult to identify the lithic artefacts. Nevertheless, the Late Early Pleistocene lakeshore may have been an area that humans visited occasionally for hunting/scavenging and to meet their water needs. The lithics were made from various materials, including stream cobbles, flints of different colors and qualities, as well as a few pieces of radiolarite and mudstone. The artefact assemblage reflects a small-tool tradition, with tools made on small flakes/flake fragments as well as cobbles/cobble fragments. The tool assemblage includes notched tools, denticulated tools, retouched pieces, borers, atypical end scrapers, side scrapers, composite tools, and a single rabot. Additionally, a chop- per and a cleaver-one of the defining tools of the Acheulean culture-were found among the artefacts. However, previous surveys in the Burdur area have not yielded bifacial tools or cleaver from the Acheulean culture. Thus, the cleaver in question is, for now, a unique example for Burdur.																			1301-7667						2025	33						7	27																WOS:001459343300001

Sources and spatial variation of dissolved organic matter in Luoma lake	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												In order to investigate the characteristics, sources and variations in the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during the wet and dry seasons in Luoma Lake, UVvis and 3D-EEMs techniques combined with PARAFAC were used to analyse the changes in DOM content and components in dry and wet season. The results of the study showed that PARAFAC identified three types of fluorescent fractions, C1 (humus-like fraction), C2 (fulviclike fraction) and C3 (protein-like fraction). The fluorescence intensity of the DOM fraction was significantly higher in wet seasons than in dry seasons. The spectral parameters of DOM indicated that the water body of Luoma Lake was mainly autogenous due to the combined effects of endogenous and exogenous inputs. The relative concentrations of DOM in Luoma Lake were lower in the dry season than in the wet season, and the proportion of hydrophobic components and the degree of aromatization of DOM were higher in the wet season. The findings demonstrated that hydrological seasonality and anthropogenic activities were key drivers for the DOM compositions and sources variations, which will improve our understanding on the crucial role of DOM in biogeochemical cycle, as well as help to guide water quality protection in Luoma Lake.																			1790-7632						2025	27	4							06922	10.30955/gnj.06922	http://dx.doi.org/10.30955/gnj.06922													WOS:001489932700003

Temporal patterns of Lesser flamingo visits may be related to the abundance and availability of their primary phytoplankton food items, and phytoplankton growth and composition may also be influenced by water quality parameters. This study aims to investigate the relationship between Lesser flamingo abundance and the physico-chemical characteristics of the wetland and its phytoplankton community dynamics.MethodsWe measured the abundance of Lesser flamingos using the ground vantage point counting method. We assessed water physico-chemical characteristics using field measurements of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity and turbidity, and laboratory sample analyses for phosphorus, ammonia, nitrate, silica, alkalinity and chlorophyll a. We also measured phytoplankton diversity and abundance in the laboratory.ResultsThe physico-chemical characteristics of the Chelekleka wetland showed a favorable environment for biological productivity and physiological activities of aquatic organisms. High phytoplankton richness (83 taxa) and abundance were recorded in the wetland. Lesser flamingo abundance varied significantly in response to the abundance of preferred phytoplankton prey items, which could be attributed to the effect of aquatic grazers and changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the wetland.ConclusionWater physico-chemical characteristics influence the abundance and availability of phytoplankton in the seasonally flooded wetland, which in turn influences the seasonal visitation and abundance of Lesser flamingos foraging on phytoplankton prey.Implications for ConservationWe recommend that the local government and other relevant stakeholders implement integrated wetland conservation practices to alleviate wetland degradation and conserve the ecosystem and its associated wildlife.					; Estifanos, Getacher/AGQ-3324-2022; Argaw, Hailu Tilahun/ITV-2312-2023	Beyene, Getacher/0000-0001-6510-8627; 													1940-0829					JAN	2025	18								19400829251314991	10.1177/19400829251314991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/19400829251314991													WOS:001400878800001

Salinity changed differently in lakes, as well as some other characteristics. This was due to the individual peculiarities of lakes, namely one being flowing, and another being terminal. In both lakes, the water temperature increased, which was more pronounced in the terminal lake. Some quasiperiodic changes were also noted.Conclusions This study presents the largely neglected effect of interactions between regional climatic changes and individual lake peculiarities, as well as between directed trends and natural cycles.Implications This information is valuable for the management of waterbodies, resource use and the development of sustainable polyaquaculture in them.

Exploring natural allies: Survey and identification of larval parasitoids of the American grape berry moth, Paralobesia viteana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in northwestern Pennsylvania	PLOS ONE												The American grape berry moth (GBM), Paralobesia viteana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is an economically important pest of grapes. The larvae of this insect burrow inside the fruit upon hatching, consuming, and contaminating grapes and clusters. Current GBM management relies on pesticide applications, which do not offer complete protection due to the cryptic behavior of the larvae and asynchrony in egg-laying, highlighting the need to develop new management strategies. In this study, we identified GBM larval parasitoids in commercial vineyards and quantified their parasitism rates. Parasitoid samplings were conducted biweekly in six conventionally managed 'Concord' vineyards in Erie County, Pennsylvania, during the 2023 and 2024 growing seasons. GBM-infested samples were monitored daily to track the emergence of both parasitoids and GBM, enabling the calculation of parasitism rates. We identified eight parasitoid species: Enytus obliteratus (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), Campoplex tortricidis (Cushman) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), Scambus spp. Hartig (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), Glypta cf. depressa Dasch, Glypta cf. ohioensis Dasch, and Glypta cf. ignota Dasch (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae); Bracon variabilis (Provancher) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), and Goniozus fratellus Evans (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) preying on GBM larvae. From these, B. variabilis, E. obliteratus, and G. fratellus were the most abundant. We also designed a graphic taxonomic key to facilitate the identification of these species. The parasitoid abundance differed over the growing season but was greatest in early August, reaching parasitism rates of up to 39% and 52.1% in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Our results demonstrate that GBM has several larval parasitoids that help reduce its populations in commercial vineyards. This research represents a first step toward our understanding of the GBM native natural enemies present in the Lake Erie Region and their potential use in pest management programs.					; Khanal, Neetu/KPB-4930-2024; Acevedo, Flor/AAD-8780-2019	gomez llano, jesus hernando/0000-0003-4335-9518; 														1932-6203					2025	20	5							e0317274	10.1371/journal.pone.0317274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0317274								40388440					WOS:001491376800011

Deep learning models can extract calving front positions from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to track seasonal ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However, they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in particular for SAR imagery. To address this challenge, we propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9563 Sentinel-1 (S1) and 14 Sentinel-2 (S2) images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that combines a Swin-Transformer encoder with a residual convolutional neural network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean distance error (MDE) of 293m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe) benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67m. Evaluating an ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark dataset reveals an MDE of 75m, approaching the human performance of 38m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal changes in glacier calving fronts.

Information on the reproductive biology of this species is limited, which poses challenges for management of its fisheries and exploring its aquaculture potential. Therefore, reproductive biology of E. tetradactylum was studied from the northeastern Arabian Sea based on 824 samples from the coast of Navsari, Gujarat, India during September 2021 to August 2022. E. tetradactylum males and females were classified into five reproductive stages: immature, developing, mature, ripe and spent based on macroscopic and histological investigations. Intersex individuals were categorised into three stages viz., initiation of transition, mid-transition and late transition phases. The overall sex ratio of males to females was 1:0.89 (p<0.05), indicating a male-dominant population in the region. Length at first sex change in transition fish was 36.2 cm in total length (TL), length at first maturity (Lm50) of males and females were 24 and 41 cm TL respectively. The absolute fecundity ranged from 1,58,080-12,53,571 eggs with mean value 5,85,886 +/- 53,315.1. Both males and females showed seasonal variations in the GSI values, with the highest values observed from May to October with a peak in August. The presence of all stages of oocytes in mature fish indicated that E. tetradactylum is a multiple spawner with asynchronous ovary having prolonged spawning season from May to November with a peak during August to September that coincides with the monsoon season in north-eastern Arabian Sea.

Our goal was to understand the distribution and demographic traits of this population within the Seasonal Lakes of Pivka Nature Park (KP PPJ). From 2021 to 2022, we mapped suitable habitat patches in KP PPJ with the larval host plant Sanguisorba offi cinalis and host ant Myrmica spp. Out of eight identified potential patches, five were inhabited for at least one year. Our dispersal model, using an inverse-power function, indicated that all but one suitable patch could be connected by migrations of at least 1% of either sex, suggesting a metapopulation structure. The clustered habitat distribution (nearest neighbour index = 0.14) highlights the role of each patch as a "stepping stone" within the system. We also assessed demographic parameters in a subset of three patches: Klenik, Kalec, and Zagorje. In 2021, mark-release-recapture estimated the populations in two inhabited patches (Klenik, Kalec) at 197 males (95% CI: 159-265) and 315 females (95% CI: 205-525), showing a female-biased sex ratio (males : females = 1 : 1.6). We recorded a relatively long average life span (4.4 and 8.4 days for males and females, respectively) and a weak protandry, however about three-quarters of the population was present simultaneously, mainly in the largest patch (Klenik: > 85%). Recorded demographic traits (female-biased sex ratio, long lifespan, simultaneous peaks of both sexes, and high dispersal) support the persistence of this metapopulation. However, conservation efforts and a denser network of suitable patches are crucial to maintain its viability at this range's southern edge.

More than one hundred species of arthropods have been found to feed on water hyacinth. Still, only a few are used as traditional biological control agents. The weed invaded freshwater bodies, but officially no biological control agents were implemented to manage it in Ethiopia. This study determined the occurrence of the water hyacinth-associated herbivore arthropods and their impact on the weed in the country. Randomly selected 0.5 m2 quadrats containing damaged water hyacinth plants were collected seasonally from Lake Koka, Lake Ziway, and Wonji Sugar Cane Farm drain. The weed growth parameters, herbivore species, and density were determined. Neochetina bruchi and Neochetina eichhorniae, Spodoptera littoralis, Aphis gossypii, and Tetranychus urticae were the identified herbivores. Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS version 9.4. Higher number of N. bruchi (8.6/quadrat), and N. eichhorniae (1.2/quadrat) were found in the wet season on Lake Koka. Higher densities of S. littoralis (6.9/quadrat), A. gossypii (21.8/plant), and T. urticae (5.8/plant) were in the dry season at Wonji drain. In the growth parameters of the water hyacinth, higher weed number (249.4/quadrat), weight (29.0 kg/quadrat), and infestation percentage (17.8/quadrat) were found in the wet season at the Wonji drain. The density of the Neochetina spp. recorded per water hyacinth plant was inadequate to manage it without augmentation. Moreover, there should be further investigation to determine the effects of indigenous herbivores on the water hyacinth.

Here we report a study comparing the microbial composition and diversities in agricultural surface waters in Ontario, Canada, including the streams adjacent to dairy cattle production in eastern Ontario and the field runoffs from the manure-impacted experimental farm of south-western Ontario. We also studied the quality of the surface water in the western basin of Lake Erie during a harmful algal bloom (cHAB). In eastern Ontario, we found significantly lower (P < 0.01) abundance of Proteobacteria and Burkholderiales in the streams adjacent to dairy production than the non-agriculture site. Bacteroidetes was more abundant (P < 0.0001) in medium/high order streams and agriculture/urban mixed site. Seasonal peaks of Flavobacterium were observed in low order streams but the trend was not in medium/high order streams. In south-western Ontario, the dominant bacterial taxa in field runoffs was Pseudomonas, regardless of manure types. We also discovered that the elevated total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus and chlorophyll a associated with the cHAB zone in Lake Erie was further away rather from the agricultural sites.

Lake morphology and meteorological conditions impact stratification of saline lakes in the Atacama Desert	PLOS ONE												Saline lakes exist in various morphologies within salar environments, occurring as ephemeral to persistent bodies of water despite evaporative conditions. Salar environments are often characterized by strong diurnal fluctuations in temperature, UV irradiation, and wind speed, however, the extent to which these meteorological conditions impact saline lakes with different morphological characteristics has yet to be investigated. Here, we evaluate the impacts of diurnal changes in wind speed and wind direction on lake water temperature, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, and stable isotope ratios of hydrogen (delta H-2), oxygen (delta O-18), and sulfur (delta S-34(SO4)) in two Na-Cl saline lakes in the Salar de Llamara (Atacama Desert, Northern Chile) with different morphologies. Results indicate that water masses in the relatively deeper (similar to 0.6 m) steep-sided lake with crystalline lake bottom remained stratified despite the nearly order of magnitude increase in diurnal wind speed, while waters in the relatively shallow (< 0.2 m), gently-sloping lake colonized by microbial mats were well-mixed. Conditions in the shallow, gently-sloping lake were heterogeneous, with diurnal variations approximating 15.6% and 23.9% of known seasonal ranges in temperature and electrical conductivity, respectively. Consequently, the chemistry of shallow, gently-sloping saline lake environments is dynamic on diurnal time scales, indicating that resident microbial communities tolerate a greater range in environmental conditions than previously appreciated. Results suggest that the impacts of diurnal changes in meteorological conditions on saline lake stratification depend on lake morphology, an observation with implications for patterns of mineral deposition in salar environments.																			1932-6203						2025	20	5							e0321759	10.1371/journal.pone.0321759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321759								40324020					WOS:001488711200047

This study investigated the concentration, seasonal difference, and risk of 14 widely used OPEs in river and reservoir source water in South China. The total concentration of OPEs was significantly higher during the dry season than during the wet season (p<0.05; median: 144 ng/L vs. 89.4 ng/L). The most dominant OPEs among the 14 investigated in source water were tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) during the dry season. No significant difference was found in the concentration and profile of OPEs between the river and reservoir source water investigated (p>0.05). The health risk of OPEs in the source water to humans was negligible (non-carcinogenic risk <1; carcinogenic risk <10-6) with the dominant contributor being tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP). The environmental ecological risk of OPEs was mostly low (risk quotient <0.1) in the source water investigated. Overall, the source waters in South China were found to be relatively safe for use as drinking water sources in the context of OPE pollution.

Various sediment P indexes are developed to assess sediment P risks by linking them to water column P, but their seasonal reliability remains underexplored. This study evaluated, for the first time, sediment P status in the Xiashan reservoir, a large shallow reservoir in northern China serving 9.4 million people. The ability of three P indexes, including exchangeable P (Ex-P), Olsen P (Olsen-P), and diluted HCl-extractable P (HCl-P), to predict water column P concentrations was tested across February, May, and August. Sediments in the Xiashan reservoir exhibited moderate total P levels (531-650 mg kg-1) but high P availability, with Ex-P, Olsen-P, and HCl-P in ranges of 19-35, 58-101, and 327-444 mg kg-1, respectively, likely due to sandy composition. Water column P concentrations significantly correlate with August sediment P indexes (r = 0.42-0.81) but not with February and May sediments, highlighting the ability of August sediment P indexes to predict water column P across seasons. Sampling in August is recommended to efficiently identify critical zones for internal P loading, with Ex-P as the preferred indicator given its simple extraction and strong correlation with water column P (r = 0.81).					liu, wei/NQF-9791-2025															2073-4441				JAN	2025	17	2							218	10.3390/w17020218	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17020218													WOS:001404759400001

Circulation of obsidians in the interior plateaus of the San Jorge Gulf (Central Patagonia), a study based on geochemical analysis	MAGALLANIA												The results of geochemical analyses of 19 obsidian artifact samples from different sectors in the interior plateaus of golfo San Jorge (MI-GSJ), central Patagonia, Argentina, are presented. The lithic artifacts were registered during surveys conducted as part of different environmental impact studies in the area. A non-destructive portable device (pXRF) was used for the analysis. The most frequent rocks in the area are local raw materials of fair, good and very good quality for knapping, while obsidian artifacts are scarce. However, given their particular characteristics, chemical composition and traceability with respect to the sources of origin, the spatial distribution of obsidian can be used as an indicator of mobility, exchanges and social interaction between hunter-gatherer groups. The results confirm the presence of obsidian from two different source areas, Pampa del Asador (chemical groups PDA1 and PDA2), located between 150 and 220 km southwest of the analyzed samples, and Sacanana (chemical group S1), located about 440 km to the north. PDA obsidians may have been acquired through logistical travel southward into the source area or from exchanges, while S1 was most likely obtained by exchanges with other hunter-gatherer groups from the north. It is proposed that both types of obsidian circulated through the MI-GSJ as part of the personal equipment of hunter-gatherers in seasonal hunting parties.

Application of the Reynolds functional groups (RFGs) method to the multispecies phytoplankton community is a valuable approach that can be used to answer ecological questions at different spatial and temporal scales. The Itupararanga reservoir, in the upper Sorocaba River basin (S & atilde;o Paulo state, Brazil), is used to supply drinking water to approximately one million people, as well as for agricultural and recreational purposes. This study examines the relationships between environmental variables and the composition of the phytoplankton community, identifying the main functional groups (RFGs) along a spatial gradient in the reservoir (from upstream to downstream), during one year. Five samplings were performed at seven points in the reservoir, in the rainy and dry seasons (from 2016 to 2017). The effects of spatial heterogeneity influenced the formation of different biomass gradients for each functional group. The most abundant RFGs were Sn (warm mixed environments), H1 (eutrophic, both stratified and shallow lakes with low nitrogen content), and Lo (deep and shallow, oligotrophic to eutrophic, medium to large lakes), which corresponded to the spatial heterogeneity of the reservoir. The variables with the greatest influence on the phytoplankton composition in the reservoir were total nitrogen, nitrite, and the N/P ratio, with phosphorus as the limiting nutrient. The presence of Cyanobacteria (codons Sn and H1) was driven by the stability of the water column, due to the long residence time of the water in the reservoir. This research demonstrated the effectiveness of using RFGs as environmental descriptors, providing an essential tool in aquatic ecology studies.

Maximum values were recorded in November for periphyton and August for epilithon; minimum values were recorded in March. Thin filamentous cyanobacteria are more responsible for changes in abundance, and biomass is determined by thick filamentous species, and in their absence, by unicellular cyanobacteria.Conclusions Cyanobacterial communities in periphyton and epilithon differed in density, seasonal dynamics, dominant species composition and response to the nutrient contents. Nitrogen, phosphorus and their ratio at optimal pH were most important for cyanobacteria, but the requirements for certain nutrients varied between biotopes.Implications This study will clarify microbial assemblages' ecological roles in coastal ecosystems and their utility as sensitive biomonitoring indicators.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2025	76	9							MF24202	10.1071/MF24202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF24202													WOS:001503192500001
J	Niu, RJ; Wen, LJ; Wang, C; Tang, H; Leppäranta, M				Niu, Ruijia; Wen, Lijuan; Wang, Chan; Tang, Hong; Lepparanta, Matti			Air-Ice-Water Temperature and Radiation Transfer via Different Surface Coverings in Ice-Covered Qinghai Lake of the Tibetan Plateau	WATER												There are numerous lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) that significantly impact regional climate and aquatic ecosystems, which often freeze seasonally owing to the high altitude. However, the special warming mechanisms of lake water under ice during the frozen period are poorly understood, particularly in terms of solar radiation penetration through lake ice. The limited understanding of these processes has posed challenges to advancing lake models and improving the understanding of air-lake energy exchange during the ice-covered period. To address this, a field experiment was conducted at Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China, in February 2022 to systematically examine thermal conditions and radiation transfer across air-ice-water interfaces. High-resolution remote sensing technologies (ultrasonic instrument and acoustic Doppler devices) were used to observe the lake surface changes, and MODIS imagery was also used to validate differences in lake surface conditions. Results showed that the water temperature under the ice warmed steadily before the ice melted. The observation period was divided into three stages based on surface condition: snow stage, sand stage, and bare ice stage. In the snow and sand stages, the lake water temperature was lower due to reduced solar radiation penetration caused by high surface reflectance (61% for 2 cm of snow) and strong absorption by 8 cm of sand (absorption-to-transmission ratio of 0.96). In contrast, during the bare ice stage, a low reflectance rate (17%) and medium absorption-to-transmission ratio (0.86) allowed 11% of solar radiation to penetrate the ice, reaching 11.70 W<middle dot>m-2, which increased the water temperature across the under-ice layer, with an extinction coefficient for lake water of 0.39 (+/- 0.03) m-1. Surface coverings also significantly influenced ice temperature. During the bare ice stage, the ice exhibited the lowest average temperature and the greatest diurnal variations. This was attributed to the highest daytime radiation absorption, as indicated by a light extinction coefficient of 5.36 (+/- 0.17) m-1, combined with the absence of insulation properties at night. This study enhances understanding of the characteristics of water/ice temperature and air-ice-water solar radiation transfer through effects of different ice coverings (snow, sand, and ice) in Qinghai Lake and provides key optical radiation parameters and in situ observations for the refinement of TP lake models, especially in the ice-covered period.					; Lepparanta, Matti/M-7507-2017	Wen, Lijuan/0000-0001-9243-9499; Lepparanta, Matti/0000-0002-4754-5564														2073-4441				JAN	2025	17	2							142	10.3390/w17020142	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17020142													WOS:001404746300001

Tyler			Non-Analog Behaviour of Eastern African Herbivore Communities During the Last Glacial Period	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Modern African ungulates navigate seasonal variation in resource availability through diet-switching (primarily mixed-feeders) and/or migrating (primarily grass grazers). These ecological generalisations are well-documented today, but the extent to which they apply to the non-analog ecosystems of the Pleistocene are unclear. Drawing from serially-sampled stable isotope measurements from 18 Kenyan large herbivore species from the Last Glacial Period (LGP), we evaluate how diet, diet-switching, and migration compare to observations from present-day settings. We find a higher grazing signal in most LGP species and a greater magnitude of diet-switching than in the present. Additionally, we find that the relationships between grass intake, migration, diet-switching, and body size during the LGP were unlike those observed today. This establishes a revised paleoecology of LGP herbivore communities and highlights that LGP herbivores were behaviourally non-analog. Our results imply that ecological observations from present-day settings offer an incomplete perspective of herbivore-environment interactions.					; Faith, J./E-7146-2015	O'Brien, Kaedan/0000-0002-2763-8333; 													1461-023X	1461-0248				JAN	2025	28	1							e70041	10.1111/ele.70041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.70041								39737742					WOS:001389092300001

We addressed these challenges using state-of-the-art single-cell genome technology (SAG-gel) combined with extensive metagenomic datasets targeting the bacterial and viral communities in Lake Biwa. From two water layers and two seasons, we obtained 862 single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs), including 176 viral (double-stranded DNA phage) contigs, which identified novel virus-host pairs involving dominant freshwater lineages. The viral infection rate, estimated by mapping the individual SAG's raw reads to viral contigs, showed little variation among samples (12.1%-18.1%) but significant variation in host taxonomy (4.2%-65.3%), with copiotrophs showing higher values than oligotrophs. The high infection rates of copiotrophs were attributed to collective infection by diverse viruses, suggesting weak density-dependent virus-host selection, presumably due to their nonpersistent interactions with viruses resulting from fluctuating abundance. In contrast, the low infection rates of oligotrophs supported the idea that their codominance with viruses is achieved by genomic microdiversification, which diversifies the virus-host specificity, sustained by their large population size and persistent density-dependent fluctuating selection. Notably, we discovered viruses infecting CL500-11, the dominant bacterioplankton lineage in deep freshwater lakes worldwide. These viruses showed extremely high read coverages in cellular and virion metagenomes but were detected in <1% of host cells, suggesting a low infection rate and high burst size. Overall, we revealed highly diverse virus-host interactions within and between host lineages that were overlooked at the metagenomic resolution.

Rock magnetic results reveal that the similar to 16.2 to similar to 10-9 Ma coarse-grained deposits at the basin's southern margin present a homogenous magnetic mineral assemblage, reflecting sediment provenance. Conversely, the similar to 13.2 to similar to 7.6 Ma, fine-grained deposits in the basin's depocenter include alternating playa-lake and lacustrine deposits, recording dry, evaporative conditions, leading to hematite formation in a low-temperature oxidizing environment, and wetter conditions that preserve the original detrital signal, respectively. Time series analyses show cyclicity in different period bands for magnetic susceptibility, but precession and obliquity cycles can hardly be resolved in the record. Comparison with deep-sea oxygen isotope data suggests that from similar to 13.2 to similar to 10.8 Ma environmental conditions likely mirrored global climatic forcing, with lacustrine and playa-lake deposits associated with increased and decreased global temperature, respectively. At similar to 10.8 Ma, the basin likely recorded the Tortonian Thermal Maximum with the establishment of a lacustrine system. From similar to 10.4 Ma, the magnetic susceptibility signal departed from the global climate record, possibly due to basin margin (western Alborz and Tarom mountains) and regional (Anatolian-Iranian plateau) topographic growth, accompanied by increased precipitation seasonality, focused rainfall and augmented erosion rates. Finally, we suggest that before similar to 10.8 Ma, the Hadley cells expanded northward, leading to a trade-dominated system with moist air masses sourced from the Caspian, while from similar to 10.8 Ma, westerlies dominance progressively prevailed.

However, it is unclear how these changes affect QTP wetland distribution in the past and future. To this end, this study estimated the potential wetland distribution in the QTP under present and future climate scenarios using five machine learning methods. We further decoupled the sensitivity of wetland area to temperature, precipitation, and glacier changes based on the control experiment, and quantified the environmental niche of QTP wetland distribution. The RusBoost algorithm model has the best performance and shows that the current potential wetland area is about 1.6 x 105 km2, accounting for 6.22% of the land surface. By 2100, QTP wetlands are projected to increase by 9.6% and 77.3% relative to the current potential wetland area under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. Climate warming and wetting are positively correlated with the future wetland areas. Each 1 degrees C increase in the warmest season temperature can lead to a 9.0% increase in QTP wetland areas. Glacial retreat to some extent leads to wetland increase, for example, in the southeastern QTP, likely due to glacial meltwater recharge. However, wetlands will decrease due to longer glacial distances in the northeast QTP, because wetlands tend to grow within a suitable distance of 30 km to glaciers. As more current wetlands spread within the recharge range of glacier meltwater, QTP wetlands expect to increase in the near future. This research provides a valuable reference for predicting wetland changes in alpine regions in the context of global warming.					; Long, Hao/AFT-1009-2022	Chen, Weizhe/0000-0001-5126-3810; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN	2025	39	1							e70047	10.1002/hyp.70047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.70047													WOS:001389839300001

AQUATIC SCIENCES												It remains uncertain whether diatom and nematode assemblages can reflect the same ecological status in eutrophic reservoirs. To address this uncertainty, we collected diatom and nematode assemblages and measured environmental variables in the tropical eutrophic Tri An Reservoir (TAR) in Vietnam. We assessed the ecological status of each community using various biological metrics, including the Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H '), the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI), and the index of trophic diversity (ITD) of nematodes. Multivariate direct gradient analysis was conducted to determine the environmental variables influencing the dominant diatom and nematode species. We then conducted a nonparametric permutational analysis of variance with two fixed factors to assess differences in all biological variables across communities. The analysis had a cross-sectional design that incorporated "station" and "season" as factors. Our findings indicated that the surface water in the TAR ranges from eutrophic to hypertrophic. Based on these TDI values, we classified the ecological and trophic status of the TAR into two groups: meso-eutrophic and eutrophic. However, the ITD of the nematodes suggested that the ecological status varied from poor to moderate or high. Our findings suggest inconsistency between two bioindicator groups in their ability to reflect surface water quality in the TAR. This study highlights the potential of using the TDI of diatoms and emphasizes the need to revise the H ' and ITD indices of nematodes if they are to be incorporated into lake monitoring programs for assessing ecological status.

Harmful algal bloom effects on fish habitat use and community structure in western Lake Erie	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Harmful algal blooms dominated by cyanobacteria have been increasing infrequency, duration, extent, and intensity in freshwater ecosystems worldwide, yet our understanding of their impact on aquatic foodwebs remains limited. This study aims to generate ecological insights that could benefit fisheries management in freshwater ecosystems experiencing harmful algal blooms, we conducted daytime and nighttime trawling (bottom and midwater) and hydroacoustic surveys inside and outside of blooms in western Lake Erie during July-August 2019. We evaluated if prey fishes use harmful algal blooms during the day as a refuge from predation and avoid them at night due to darkness and potential cyanotoxins. We also examined if visually feeding piscivorous fishes avoid these blooms due to low water clarity and high cyanobacteria concentration that could impair foraging. We did not find differences in total fish catch (in both types of trawls) or total fish density (estimated by down-looking acoustics) between harmful algal blooms and non-harmful algal blooms sites. Similarly, we foundfew differences in the use ofharmful algal blooms among feeding/habitat guilds. Walleye, Sander vitreus, an important piscivore, and abundant benthivores (Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, White Perch Morone americana, and Trout-perch Percopsis omiscomaycus) did not vary between harmful-and non-harmful algal bloom sites, regardless of when sampling occurred or trawl type (bottom or midwater). While the catch ofpelagic fishes preferred as prey by Walleye (i.e. Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax, Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum, and Notropis spp.) was higher inside of HABs relative to outside, this difference was only observed in bottom trawls (not midwater trawls). Our acoustics data did show, however, that harmful algal blooms modified the vertical distribution offish. Specifically, fish were located deeper in the water column in non-harmful algal bloom sites during the day relative to night, with this difference disappearing inside of harmful algal blooms. In addition to explaining the likely mechanisms responsible for the extensive use of harmful algal blooms by Lake Erie fishes, we discuss implications for fisheries management during the harmful algal blooms season.

Additionally, quartz, birnessite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite minerals were also found. The mineral content indicates the presence of two sulfide minerals that have the potential to form acid mine drainage, namely; pyrite (FeS2) and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). The pH measurement results of the water flowing from the iron ore stockpile have a pH of 2.9, while the void and surrounding river vary from 6.4 to 8.2. Originality. Identifying iron ore minerals by combining polarized light microscopy and XRD can enhance the reliability of the observation results. Both methods showed the same results in identifying sulfide minerals, with chalcopyrite in the excavated iron ore stockpile and pyrite in the crushed iron ore stockpile. The formation of acid mine drainage at abandoned mine sites is only a local phenomenon, and after being diluted by other water flows, the water's pH returns to neutral. Practical implications. This research activity was conducted during the rainy season when overflow occurred, with water spilling from the mine pit lake to the surrounding areas. The results show that the formation of acid mine drainage and the high concentration of total Fe that occurred in one of the stockpiles did not affect the change in water quality around the mine, and there is potential for water in the mine void to be used as a water source for the surrounding community.

J	Resmi, MR; Vaishnavi				Resmi, M. R.; Vaishnavi			Microplastic Pollution in Indian Aquatic Ecosystems: Insights and Implications	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Microplastic (MP) pollution has become a pressing environmental issue globally, prompting extensive research into its prevalence, distribution, and composition in diverse ecosystems. This study offers a comprehensive analysis of MP contamination in Indian lakes, rivers, and coastal environments, synthesizing recent investigations across the country. Significant MP abundance and distribution were observed in lakes, particularly in high-altitude and remote areas like Kashmir, Ladakh, and Himachal Pradesh. Notable findings include high MP concentrations in lakes such as Anchar Lake, Pangong Lake, and Tsomoriri Lake, with tourism, textile disposal, and industrial emissions identified as major pollution sources. Lonar Lake and Kanke Lake showed MP contamination in both surface water and sediments, highlighting the need for urgent mitigation measures. Studies on Indian rivers revealed diverse MP characteristics, with fragments, fibers, pellets, and foams being dominant. Chemical analysis identified common polymer components originating from industrial waste, plastic debris, and synthetic textiles. Seasonal and geographical factors influenced MP distribution in rivers, emphasizing plastic pollution's pervasive presence. Coastal regions of Southern India exhibited high concentrations of plastic debris, primarily fibres from synthetic textiles, with prevalent polymers derived from urban runoff, marine activities, and industrial discharges. The present study offers insightful information about the widespread and varied characteristics of MP contamination in Indian aquatic ecosystems, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive mitigation strategies to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem health. Further research is necessary to understand MP sources, impacts, and distribution, informing evidence-based management strategies to reduce the potential risks concerning people's health and the environment related to plastic contamination.Graphical AbstractDifferent environment of deposition along with microplastic						, Resmi/0000-0002-2638-4183													0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	2025	236	1							62	10.1007/s11270-024-07640-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-024-07640-1													WOS:001383627900003
J	Reta, BG; Habite, W				Reta, Birara Gebeyhu; Habite, Woinshet			Optimizing Tomato Yield in Saline-Sodic Soils With Gypsum and Mulching Techniques Near Lake Abaya, Ethiopia	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE												The productivity of tomato fruit on the western shore of Lake Abaya in Ethiopia was severely hindered by saline-sodic damage. This study aimed to assess the impact of applying gypsum and adopting soil mulching agricultural technology to improve the issues of salt-affected soil in the region. The treatments consisted of a control group (T1), mulching (T2), gypsum application (T3), and a combination of gypsum (half level) and mulching (T4). Application rates of gypsum and straw mulching were 14.5 and 15 tons/ha, respectively. The mean total seasonal crop water consumptions of tomatoes were 378 mm (non-mulching) and 333.02 mm (mulching). Straw mulching saved an average of 13.2% of soil water compared with non-mulching treatments. At the end of the growing season, exchangeable sodium percentage was decreased by 42.3% (T2), 38.1% (T3), and 43.8% (T4) compared with control T1. The pH levels at the experimental site experienced reductions of 15.1% (T2), 1.1% (T3), and 14% (T4) compared with T1. The soil electric conductivity of the soil at the end of the tomato growing period was decreased by 59.6% (T2), 19.2% (T3), and 46.2% (T4). The average land productivity of tomatoes in the current study was 14.9(c )tons/ha (T1), 16.2(b) tons/ha (T2), 15.0(c )tons/ha (T3), and 18.6a tons/ha (T4). The average water productivity of tomatoes in the current study was 5.5c kg/m(3) (T1), 7.2(b )kg/m(3) (T2), 6.5 (c) kg/m(3) (T3), and 7.8a kg/m(3) (T4). The benefit-cost ratios for T1, T2, T3, and T4 were 1.67, 2.2, 1.78, and 2.4, respectively. The optimal strategy for mitigating saline-sodic soil and ensuring sustainable tomato production involves applying gypsum at half the recommended level along with implementing straw mulching.

This study took advantage of a natural experiment in 2006 and 2007 when Black-crowned Night Herons were prevented from breeding at Lake Fetzara in the first year due to the presence of a feral cat. This event provided valuable insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of nest site selection among coexisting heron species, which consisted of Cattle Egrets (Ardea ibis), Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta) and Squacco Herons (Ardeola ralloides). After the cat was removed, egg-laying began in the core areas of the colony and gradually spread to the periphery. Species that initiated nesting early selected mid-elevation sites near the tree trunk, which likely offered protection from both ground and aerial predators, while also providing some shielding from solar radiation and strong winds. These early selected sites featured larger branches, which conferred greater nest stability. Vertical stratification was evident among the heron species; however, contrary to long-standing assumptions, it was not directly related to body size. Both vertical and horizontal stratification were observed, with nests progressively moving higher and further from the tree trunk as the breeding season advanced. The following year, Black-crowned Night Herons displaced other species to lower heights and positions further from the trunk, highlighting the significant influence of interspecific interactions on nest site selection. This study underscores the complex interplay between nest site selection, biotic interactions and abiotic factors in heron colonies, emphasising the importance of resource partitioning in maintaining species coexistence in densely populated breeding sites.

This bacterium is globally distributed, infects mainly mammals and birds, and is present in both the intestinal microbiota and the environment. The most frequently observed clinical manifestation is flaccid paralysis of the skeletal muscles, which can rapidly progress to death due to cardiorespiratory failure. Diagnosis is performed through clinical, environmental, and laboratory findings, mainly by mouse bioassay seroneutralization, which serves as the gold standard. Case Description: During the seasonal period, approximately 30-60 dead or sick animals were found in an urban park in Ribeir & atilde;o Preto, S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, between late 2020 and 2021. However, only four wild ducks (Cairina moschata) and one great egret (Ardea alba) were evaluated. All five animals presented with neurological signs of limb paralysis, dyspnea, and neck flaccidity and were unable to fly. After clinical evaluation, the animals were euthanized, and necropsies were performed. Although we observed discrete hemorrhagic enteritis in the three evaluated ducks, no other relevant lesions were found. Samples were sent to the laboratory, where type C botulinum toxin was detected. Conclusion: The presence of botulism in urban areas, especially in leisure areas, raises public health concerns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of type C botulism in a public urban park in S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil. Although this toxin does not pose a direct risk to human health, it is a strong indicator of environmental health, affecting wild free birds.

It compared the NDWI and MNDWI indices with MapBiomas data to assess water dynamics in semi-arid regions. Accuracy analysis and the kappa index showed good agreement between datasets, while trend testing revealed significant temporal changes during dry and wet seasons. Despite irregular rainfall patterns, the MNDWI index proved more effective in quantifying surface water, highlighting greater water accumulation during the rainy season. Reservoir construction influenced water distribution, but annual water retention varied throughout the study. The results underscore the importance of strategic planning for reservoirs, particularly considering solar exposure, to ensure long-term water availability. The study emphasizes that sustainable water management is essential for environmental and socioeconomic resilience in semi-arid regions, especially in climate variability and increasing demand for water resources.

Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Brachyuran Zoea in Vembanad lake, South India: Influence of Salinity Zones and Seasonal Variations	FISHERY TECHNOLOGY												This study investigates the spatio-temporal distribution of brachyuran larvae in Vembanad Lake, a tropical estuarine ecosystem. The research categorizes the estuary into three salinity zones: polyhaline, mesohaline, and oligohaline. It analyzes larval abundance in relation to key environmental factors, including temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Data collected across multiple seasons showed that larval abundance peaked during the pre-monsoon season and significantly declined during the monsoon season. The mesohaline zone exhibited the highest larval abundance, indicating of seasonal freshwater influx during the monsoon, ment of these critical habitats.																			0015-3001						2025	62	2					157	168																WOS:001502523100001

In lakes, Mysis may buffer these changes by accessing resources from both green (pelagic) and brown (benthic) energy pathways through diel vertical migration (DVM). However, Mysis exhibit partial DVM (pDVM), complicating the assessment of each pathway's contributions. We developed an individual-based model (IBM) to explore how migration behavior, under seasonally varying pelagic resources, influences the relative contribution of benthic-and pelagic-based resources to Mysis growth and reproduction, assuming migration is driven solely by daily light cycles. Model growth and reproductive output were generally maximized and lifespan minimized with increasing pelagic resource profitability, consistent with field observations. However, some individuals grew larger and produced more offspring when pDVM slowed their growth but increased their lifespan, suggesting scope for different life history strategies to emerge from the model. Our IBM provides a foundation to integrate additional factors, such as size-dependent processes, to explore the mechanisms driving pDVM and how Mysis may respond to altered lake systems.					; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023; Dur, Gael/LEM-8892-2024	Chapina, Rosaura/0000-0002-1295-6670; 													0706-652X	1205-7533					2025	82						1	20		10.1139/cjfas-2025-0020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2025-0020													WOS:001570666900001
J	Su, Y; Ling, BZ; Ren, JT				Su, Yin; Ling, Bingze; Ren, Jintong			Seasonal and spatial variations in eutrophication and water quality of Lake Aha, Guiyang city, China	PLOS ONE												This study aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in water quality status and eutrophication level of Lake Aha, influenced by human activities and seasonal changes. Ten indicators were sampled and analyzed at seven sampling points in Lake Aha in different seasons and vertical layers. The eutrophication level and water quality status were evaluated using the Trophic Level Index (TLI) and Water Quality Index (WQI). Results showed that the average TLI and WQI values during the wet season (July) were 31.06 and 92.14, respectively, compared to 28.64 and 109.14 during the dry season (April). Eutrophication was more severe in the wet season than in the dry season, whereas water quality was poorer in the dry season than in the wet season. The main factors driving these patters were temperature and precipitation, respectively. Spatially, the northern part of Lake Aha exhibited higher eutrophication levels than the southern part, while water quality was better in the south than in the north, largely due to the impact of human activities. Significant differences in eutrophication levels and water quality were observed among the seven sampling points, though variations across vertical layers were minimal. Strong positive correlations between key indicators-such as CODMn, TP, and Chl-a-highlighted interdependencies affecting overall water quality, with these factors identified as critical drivers of TLI and WQI. These findings indicate the important impacts of seasonal changes and human activities on the water quality of Lake Aha and suggest the need for targeted water pollution management strategies.																			1932-6203						2025	20	5							e0321562	10.1371/journal.pone.0321562	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321562								40333943					WOS:001488722300036

The intra-annual cycle of variability of both hydrological characteristics is reconstructed experimentally, and characteristic peculiarities of their vertical distribution during the different seasons are deduced. Based on data registered from a coastal meteorological station on the bank of the channel between the lakes, as well as from other two regional ones, the character of atmospheric influences on the studied water area for the indicated period is summarized. The salinity in Beloslav Lake is significantly affected by the inflow of the Provadiyska river and the precipitation in the area.

Influence of morphology and functional properties of floodplain water bodies on species diversity of macrophyte communities	REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS												The present study elucidates the morphological and functional characteristics of the water bodies within the Dnipro-Orelskyi Nature Reserve and examines their influence on the species composition of macrophytes. It was determined that the diversity of functional types of water bodies-including confluent lakes, contrafluent lakes, isolated floodplain lakes, canals, and artificial reservoirs-plays a crucial role in determining macrophyte biodiversity and in providing essential ecosystem services. Notably, confluent lakes exhibit the highest levels of species richness, attributable to their pronounced hydrodynamic activity, the variety of micro-habitats present, and regular water exchange, which enriches the ecosystem with nutrients. Conversely, isolated floodplain lakes demonstrate the lowest levels of diversity, primarily due to restricted exchange with the river system, eutrophication, and the accumulation of organic matter, which hinder the growth of various plant species. Furthermore, the morphological attributes of water bodies-such as area, depth, shoreline complexity, and axis ratio-significantly influence the species composition of macrophytes. An increase in the size of water bodies correlates with a decline in biodiversity, as competitive species become dominant and the diversity of microhabitats diminishes. Water bodies with an elongated shape and less fragmented shorelines create conditions that are less conducive to macrophyte development, thereby reducing the availability of shallow water zones and sheltered areas suitable for rooting. In contrast, smaller water bodies with irregular shorelines offer a greater variety of habitats, which contributes to the maintenance of high biodiversity levels. The findings of this study contribute significantly to the understanding of the role of water bodies in sustaining ecosystem services and underscore the necessity for sustainable management of natural resources. The research specifically highlights the consequences of alterations in the hydrological regime resulting from reservoir construction. The stabilization of water levels has diminished seasonal dynamics, thereby impacting floodplain ecosystems. The continuous presence water in the lower regions of the floodplain, along with the absence of regular flooding, has created conditions that markedly deviate from their natural state. The study emphasizes the critical importance of maintaining hydrological dynamics to support ecosystem functions such as water balance regulation, water purification, bank stabilization, and the promotion of biodiversity. Future research should focus on analyzing the effects of seasonal and long-term changes on the structure and functioning of water bodies, evaluating the impacts of anthropogenic and climatic factors, and formulating adaptive water management strategies.

Stake net fishery in the Chettuva Estuary, south-western coast of India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												The stake net landing in the Chettuva Estuary was studied for two years from October 2019-September 2021 on the basis of the data and samples collected fortnightly from five stations along the estuary. A total of 123 species of finfish and shellfish belonging to 98 genera, 56 families and 29 orders were recorded during the study. The average monthly landing by stake net was estimated as 51.86 t and the catch was minimal during August and maximum in March. Seasonally, 38.65% of the catch was recorded during the pre-monsoon season, followed by 35.02% during the post-monsoon and the remaining 26.33% caught during the monsoon season. Shrimps dominated the total landings in all the months and stations, with an average contribution of 58.72%, followed by 35.79% by fishes and 5.49% by crabs. The mean catch per unit effort in the Chettuva Estuary was estimated to be 24.69 kg and the catch rates of shrimps, crabs and fishes were 14.13, 1.66 and 8.89 kg, respectively. The trend in the catch rate for both shrimps and total resources remained the same for all the stations as well as for all the months, indicating the importance of shrimp catch in the fishery by stake nets in the Chettuva Estuary. The modal length classes observed for these species indicated that majority of them were juveniles. The exploitation of juveniles, especially of shrimps, by stake nets in this estuary is a matter of concern; hence, increasing the cod end mesh size of the nets operating in the Chettuva Estuary is recommended for resource sustainability.																			0970-6011						2025	72	1					138	146		10.21077/ijf.2025.72.1.144739-18	http://dx.doi.org/10.21077/ijf.2025.72.1.144739-18													WOS:001504539700018

Towards a ground-truthing of satellite imagery to track harmful algal blooms in Canadian prairie lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A mounting task in the aquatic sciences is to better monitor harmful algal blooms (HABs). In Canada, satellite Earth Observation is used to meet this challenge in a few large lakes (e.g., Lake Erie, Lake Winnipeg). Here, we highlight the novel ground truthing of an algorithm for multivariate analyses of HABs in a smaller Canadian prairie lake (Pigeon Lake, Alberta) using Sentinel 2 satellite-based data and confirmatory evidence from in situ concentrations of chlorophyll a and taxonomically diagnostic algal pigments. Calibration (r2 = 0.90, n = 73) and validation (r2 = 0.91, n = 86) of our model enabled testing for trends and discovery of within-lake sources of HABs using archival satellite imagery spanning a period of 6 years. Significant seasonality of the intensity, spatial extent, and severity of HABs in the study lake underscored our discovery of their origins near inflowing streams within the northwestern littoral zone. These findings highlight the potential of our remote-sensing approach to identify "hotspots" of HABs and help guide remediation strategies in small prairie lakes.

As the largest freshwater lake in China, the ecological integrity of Poyang Lake has attracted much attention due to the over-exploitation of its water resources in recent years. In this study, several biological and water quality surveys on water ecological conditions were carried out at 11 sampling points of Poyang Lake from 1998 to 2022, and the ecological health of Poyang Lake was evaluated by use of the O/E (Observation/Expectation) model and the chemical-biological index method according to the status of the water quality and the structure of the benthic fauna in the four seasons, respectively. The results showed that the benthic community structure is simple, and the biodiversity is low, which is mainly dominated by Insecta in Arthropoda and Oligochaeta in Oroidea, accounting for 84.3% and 42.4%, respectively; the results of the O/E index evaluated under the threshold of probability of capture >= 0.5 showed that the health grade of all sections was sub-healthy or average, which was consistent with the results of the chemical-biological composite index evaluation. The dual evaluation method of the O/E model and chemical-biological composite index adopted in this study integrates more than twenty years of long-time scale data; this method combined with long time scale data has not been studied before, and its advantage is that it can more objectively show the change in the ecological situation of Poyang Lake for many years. The results of the present study could provide a theoretical basis and technical support for the evaluation of lake water environment quality.					; Huang, Wenjie/G-1778-2017	feng, chenglian/0000-0001-5493-574X; Wang, Hongyang/0009-0007-1737-6783														2305-6304				JAN	2025	13	1							1	10.3390/toxics13010001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics13010001								39853001					WOS:001403659200001
J	Wang, XZ; Kurata, K				Wang, Xizhe; Kurata, Kengo			Identification and management of ecosystem vulnerability in brackish lakes based on phytoplankton primary productivity dynamics: A case study of lake Nakaumi, Japan	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Lake Nakaumi is a typical brackish lake located on the western coast of Honshu, Japan. The lake is dominated by phytoplankton, with a lack of higher aquatic organisms, resulting in relatively low ecosystem stability. The primary productivity of phytoplankton can be regarded as an important indicator of the current environmental status of Lake Nakaumi. Therefore, studying the dynamic changes in primary productivity is a crucial basis for implementing ecosystem management in the lake. This study used the mature Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) and regression analysis to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton primary productivity (PPeu) in Lake Nakaumi from March 2023 to February 2024, as well as its main driving factors. This study explored the causes of differences in PPeu under different spatial and temporal conditions, summarized the key issues contributing to ecosystem instability, and identified sensitive periods and regions. Based on a comprehensive assessment, a systematic and feasible ecosystem management strategy for Lake Nakaumi is proposed.																			2299-8993						2025	26	9					60	71		10.12911/22998993/22998993/204821	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/22998993/204821													WOS:001529646800006

Under the background of climate warming, permafrost was thawing accompanied with ground surface thaw settlement in the SRYR in recent years. Permafrost degradation has resulted in the lowered water table, shrinking lakes and wetlands, and accelerated desertification, posing significant threats to ecological security and the sustainability of water resources in the SRYR. In this article, we analyzed spatiotemporal changes in permafrost degradation by deriving ground surface deformation from advanced land observing satellite PALSAR data for 2007-2010 and Sentinel-1 data for 2017-2021. To better analyze variations in the deformation time series, two indicators-time-series correlation and annual average growth rate (AAGR) were introduced to quantify the differences. Geodetector method was utilized to explore the factors influencing the spatial and temporal differences in permafrost degradation. The results show that the average deformation rate in the study area was -2.1 and -9.2 mm/a during the 2007-2010 and 2017-2021 period, respectively, with an average seasonal deformation at approximately 19.8 and 14.1 mm, respectively. Approximately 40% of the area experienced varying degrees of degradation, primarily in the southern and northeastern of the SRYR. About 13% of the area showing an AAGR of ground deformation greater than 25%. The majority of areas experienced accelerated permafrost degradation were situated in plains, wetlands and regions where thermokarst lakes are widely distributed and developed. Differences in precipitation distribution and rising land surface temperature are the main drivers of the accelerated permafrost thawing in the SRYR.

By integrating Sentinel-1 SAR-based water body extraction and small baseline subset interferometric SAR deformation monitoring techniques, we reveal the disaster mechanism resulting from the combined effects of extreme hydrological events and structural defects of the dike system. The results demonstrate that the average prebreach water surface area was 5.87 km(2), which peaked at 47.46 km(2) postdisaster, causing significant damage to the local area. Deformation monitoring identified certain dike sections with annual deformation exceeding 60 mm, with the breach section showing abnormal pre-event deformation characteristics, including reverse displacement patterns, indicating substantial safety risks. Hydrological analysis shows the water level during the 2024 flood season rose at an average daily rate of 0.50 m, 1.8 times higher than normal years, leading to seepage failure of the dike foundation. Through a comprehensive analysis of inundation extent, deformation monitoring, and hydrological conditions, this study provides a novel approach for disaster early warning and risk assessment in similar regions, offering both theoretical significance and practical value.																			1939-1404	2151-1535					2025	18						17449	17459		10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3586897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3586897													WOS:001537203200016

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Water-Body Monitoring and Erosion-Deposition Analysis of East Dongting Lake Based on Long Time-Series Remote Sensing Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												Over the past century, interconnected lakes along the middle and lower Yangtze River have undergone significant siltation, shrinkage, and even disappearance, exacerbating hydrological extremes, such as floods, droughts, and abrupt dry-wet transitions. To investigate the evolution of the river-lake relationship in East Dongting Lake under these new conditions, this study utilized the Google Earth Engine platform to extract the water-body extent of East Dongting Lake from 1987 to 2023. We quantified spatiotemporal variations through three analytical dimensions: interannual dynamics, monthly fluctuations, and water-body type. In addition, a correlation analysis between water-body area and water level was conducted using water-level data from Chenglingji and Lujiao. Key findings include: First, a declining trend in the maximum annual water surface area (-0.16 km(2)/yr), contrasted with an increasing trend in the minimum areas (+1.14 km(2)/yr); second, pronounced intra-annual variability, with peaks in July (936.70 km(2)) and minima in January (231.56 km(2)); and third, a strong correlation was observed between the water surface area of East Dongting Lake and the water levels recorded at Chenglingji and Lujiao hydrological stations. Among the four regression models evaluated, the cubic polynomial model exhibited the highest fitting performance (R-2>0.9). Notably, under similar water-level conditions (particularly at middle and low levels), the water area of East Dongting Lake exhibited a decreasing trend. A slight reduction in the permanent water bodies in the central and southwestern regions was observed, alongside an increase in the proportion of seasonal water bodies. These trends suggest that some areas of East Dongting Lake may be undergoing a siltation process.																			1939-1404	2151-1535					2025	18						17580	17591		10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3585990	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3585990													WOS:001534516000012

A total of 498 specimens were collected using gillnets. Of these, 302 (60.6%) fish had different foods, while 196 (39.4%) were empty. The fish were dissected, their stomachs were removed, and stomach contents were preserved in a 5% formalin solution. Frequency of occurrence, volumetric method, index of preponderance, and geometric importance index were used to study the feeding pattern. Detritus was the primary food, accounting for 61.6% of the guts by volume. Mud, zooplankton, and phytoplankton were the second most important food items comprising 24.4%, 3.9%, and 2.8% by volume respectively. Feeding pattern differed with the size classes of fish. The smallest fish (<16.5 cm Fork length) consumed detritus, mud, and insects comprised 64.2%, 18.7%, and 7.3% by volume, respectively. The adult fish (>17.0 cm FL) majorly consumed detritus followed by mud. The importance of mud increases when the fish grows more except (>31.5 cm FL) size class. The proportions of food items of L. intermedius significantly varied with respect to the dry and wet seasons. Detritus and mud were mostly consumed in the dry season, contributing to 47.8% and 32.4% by volume, respectively. Detritus was the most preferred food item during the wet season, contributing 97.2% of the total guts and 75.6% by volume. Generally, L. intermedius feeding pattern depending on size classes and seasonal variations this may be linked to food availability in the reservoir.					; Tesfahun, Agumassie/KDN-9068-2024	Tesfahun, Agumassie/0000-0001-6387-0546; 													2331-1932					DEC 31	2024	10	1							2298528	10.1080/23311932.2023.2298528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2023.2298528													WOS:001145434500001

Distribution and morphometry of large supraglacial channels on five Antarctic ice shelves	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Supraglacial channels play a crucial role in transporting meltwater across ice sheets and ice shelves. Despite their importance, recent research has tended to focus on the storage of supraglacial meltwater (e.g. in lakes), and our understanding of the distribution and connectivity of channels is more limited, particularly in Antarctica. Here we investigate large (>30 m wide) supraglacial channels on five contrasting ice shelves in Antarctica during the melt seasons of 2020 and 2022. Supraglacial channels are mapped by applying an automated delineation method to Landsat-8 satellite imagery, and various metrics are calculated to quantify and describe their fluvial morphometry. Results show that supraglacial channels are extensive on all five ice shelves, forming a total of 119 channel networks that exhibit relatively simple structures that do not exceed fourth-order Strahler ordering and which mostly occur on low ice surface slopes (<0.001) and at low elevations where ice is slow-flowing (<150 m a(-1)). The orientation of channels broadly coincides with the ice flow direction and is clearly influenced by surface structures (e.g. longitudinal flow-stripes), which appear to exert a strong control on both channel formation and their morphological properties.

The Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the largest dam in the world, has been in operation since 2003 to regulate water resources downstream. However, most of the current research on the TGD compares the post-2003 hydrologic patterns downstream of the TGD with the pre-2003 hydrologic patterns and lacks direct evidence of the TGD impacts on the downstream areas. In this paper, the ecological impacts of TGD on downstream large lakes are explored in terms of hydrological alteration degree, biodiversity, connectivity, and ecological surplus and ecological deficit by building a 1/2-dimensional nested model to simulate the hydrological processes with and without the TGD from 2008 to 2011. The results showed that (1) TGD storage led to a decrease in the number of high pulses at downstream stations, resulting in wetland degradation in the riverine region; (2) the SI (Shannon's diversity index) based on hydrological calculations became smaller, indicating that the downstream biodiversity showed a decreasing trend; (3) the diversion ratio and the confluence ratio of Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River decreased at the same time, and the connectivity decreased, which would lead to an increase in the degree and frequency of droughts during the dry season;(4) after the regulation of the TGD, the low-risk months were transformed into medium-risk months of the Dongting Lake basin, indicating a deterioration of the ecological situation in this region. The study demonstrates that the construction of the TGD has exacerbated downstream water stress, while the degradation of wetlands and the reduction in biodiversity highlight the heightened pressure on ecological and environmental protection downstream of the TGD. The results of this study provide necessary information for evaluating the impact of the TGD project on large lakes downstream and provide feasible suggestions for water resource management and ecological protection in the Yangtze River basin to ensure the realization of sustainable development in the future.

This study investigated Sb flux from lake sediments of Yellowknife Bay (Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada), which were contaminated by gold mining operations. Sediment Sb fluxes were measured in the field by short term (2-6 day) incubations of intact sediment cores and in the laboratory by incubating bulk sediment over a longer 30-day period. Antimony diffusion from sediment to overlying water was observed in 17 of 28 intact cores (61%), with flux rates ranging from 10 to 279 mu g/m(2)/day. Overlying water and surface sediment remained oxic during the field measurements. Sediment Sb concentration (0.7-47 mu g/g) was positively correlated with Sb flux, and the mineralogy of the sediment, characterized in a companion study, likely influenced flux spatial patterns. Other environmental factors, specifically season, temperature, organic matter content, and iron or manganese concentrations of sediment did not explain Sb flux. Porewater Sb concentrations were low (0.2-9.6 mu g/L), and porewater depth profiles were not related to solid-phase Sb concentration, suggesting limited post-depositional mobility within sediments. Laboratory incubation of mixed bulk sediments showed higher Sb fluxes of 185-1555 mu g/m(2)/day over the course of a 30-day experiment. Temperature warming from 7 to 22 degrees C did not enhance the Sb flux. Higher Sb fluxes in the laboratory versus field measurements may have been due to (i) more Sb in the laboratory sediments (similar to 160 mu g/g), and (ii) oxidative dissolution of stibnite and Sb sulfosalt minerals that were previously stable in deeper anoxic sediments but disturbed and exposed to oxygen during laboratory manipulation. This study demonstrated that Sb can diffuse from mining-contaminated sediments into overlying water under oxic conditions, with fluxes influenced by sediment Sb concentrations and mineralogy.

Most of the study area is in one of the fastest-warming parts of the globe. Our research, conducted in four lakes varying in water salinity level and located in western Kazakhstan in the steppe, semi-desert, and desert zones, can be used to predict biodiversity as indicators of the natural potential of ecosystems. This was achieved by assessing the associations of invertebrate communities with environmental conditions based on data collected during nine seasonal measurement campaigns (in May, July, and September of 2019, 2020, and 2021). The multidimensional scaling (nMDS) of biotic and abiotic data enabled us to identify lakes as freshwater (1), oligohaline (1), and mesohaline (2). The key classifier was biotope salinity, irrespective of lake location in the steppe, semi-desert, or desert zones. Twenty-nine taxa were identified in the freshwater lake, 37 in the oligohaline, and 24-28 in the mesohaline lake; these accounted for similar to 80% of their estimated taxonomic composition, according to Species Accumulation Curves (SAC). The differences in the structure of benthic invertebrate assemblages revealed between the lakes are mainly concerned with the density and, to a lesser extent, the diversity of communities (Simpson index). As the salinity of the waters increased, the proportion of Diptera larvae significantly increased, and that of Ephemeroptera larvae decreased. Sigara assimilis, accompanied by Sphaeromas sp., Chironomus sp., and Saeharia sp., proved strongly resistant to increased water salinity. Among the studied lakes, the semi-desert lake Balykty Sarkyl (beta-mesohaline) is strongly threatened by biodiversity degradation due to unfavourable climatic conditions. Time series analysis for Lake Edilsor (alpha-mesohaline) shows that it underwent the most rapid salinisation, which has increased the number of taxa tolerant to this predictor (mainly Diptera larvae). The results confirm that detailed taxonomic assessment (including time series) can significantly improve our understanding of lake changes with increasing salinity caused by climate change and/or other stressors.

We present a unique dataset, with the isotopic composition (delta 18O and delta 2H) of meteoric waters, derived from a nationwide study in Cuba. It includes monthly composite and event-based precipitations, from January 2017 to December 2021 (N = 526 and N = 111 respectively). Monthly data showed minor seasonal trends (dry vs. rainy), with a notable influence of tropical cyclones. Event-based data demonstrated that precipitation associated with tropical cyclones exhibited lower isotopic compositions. The analysis of potential factors influencing the isotopic composition of precipitation showed a minor influence of the rainfall amount, but negligible influence of factors such are relative humidity, elevation, and air temperature. This data set can be used as a tool not only to understand hydrological processes at the country scale, but also to further improve and develop isotope-enabled modelling for assessing water balances and fluxes, understanding the impact of extreme events, and paleoreconstruction in the Intra-Americas Sea.					; Morera Gomez, Yasser/D-3078-2017; Murillo, Ricardo/I-8514-2019; Sanchez-Murillo, Ricardo/I-8514-2019; Morera-Gómez, Yasser/J-3468-2019	Brigido Flores, Osvaldo/0000-0002-2779-6606; Garcia-Moya, Alejandro/0000-0002-5704-6355; Morera Gomez, Yasser/0000-0001-6174-3869; Sanchez-Llull, Minerva/0000-0001-9793-283X; Sanchez-Murillo, Ricardo/0000-0001-8721-8093; 														2052-4463				DEC 19	2024	11	1							1398	10.1038/s41597-024-04178-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-04178-z								39702643					WOS:001380492600006

The study examined microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR) in the pond water, gills, hepatopancreas, and muscle of shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei) from shrimp ponds on the northern coast of East Java and its effects on their histological structures. In shrimp ponds dominated by cyanobacteria particularly Microcystis and Oscillatoria, MC-LR levels were high. In pond water, Microcystis and Oscillatoria levels increased along with NO2-, NH4+, clarity, and salinity. Shrimp tissues, such as the gills and hepatopancreas, experienced elevated MC-LR concentrations as a consequence of the MC-LR toxin increase in pond water. Shrimp inhabitants of ponds with elevated MC-LR concentrations exhibited significant changes in histological architecture, like hyperplasia in gill tissue and extensive vacuolation in hepatopancreas tissue. L. vannamei muscle samples show MC-LR amounts below the WHO's recommended daily intake of 0.04 mu g/kg body weight/day, indicating no health risks to humans.

J	Liu, SJ; Fu, X; Li, Y; Chu, XF				Liu, Shuangjun; Fu, Xiang; Li, Yu; Chu, Xuefeng			Balanced hydropower and ecological benefits in reservoir-river-lake system: An integrated framework with machine learning and game theory	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The negative impacts of large hydroelectric reservoirs on downstream ecosystems have attracted worldwide attention. Few attempts have been made to dynamically predict ecological benefits and rationally negotiation in the reservoir-river-lake (RRL) system. This study addresses these gaps by developing an integrated framework with machine learning and game theory to balanced hydropower and ecological benefits. The proposed framework integrated the RRL system simulation with a bargaining model, utilizing a machine learning model to forecast lake levels and the equivalent factor method to assess downstream ecosystem service values (ESV). The study evaluated the framework's generalizability and accuracy by applying random and actual runoff series within the Three Gorges Reservoir to the Dongting Lake region. The 2022 mega-drought case study revealed that the Nash equilibrium operation could simultaneously enhance hydropower generation (7.55%) and ecological benefits (20.00%). Notably, ESV improvements of 61.58% during the post-flood season and 36.07% during the dry season underscored the framework's effectiveness in elevating the ecological benefits. The comparison with traditional multi-objective optimization showed that the proposed framework provided reliable and acceptable solutions for decision-makers. The dynamic weight change elucidates the intricate interactions between economic and ecological benefits, enabling a nuanced adjustment of the single weights in the traditional framework. In addition to enhancing the theoretical framework, the Nash equilibrium solutions also showed positive effects on the carbon cycle, plant growth, and animal habitats in Dongting Lake, further highlighting the practical significance. This research offers a practical management tool for reconciling the conflict in an RRL integrated system, providing theoretical and practical insights into sustainable environment and ecosystem management.					; Chu, Xuefeng/H-7285-2012; Liu, Shuangjun/JYQ-2473-2024	Li, Yu/0000-0001-7749-7172; Chu, Xuefeng/0000-0003-0322-0271; Liu, Shuangjun/0000-0002-3373-2393													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN	2025	373								123746	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123746		DEC 2024						39693991					WOS:001391040900001
J	Sithirith, M; Grundy-Warr, C				Sithirith, Mak; Grundy-Warr, Carl			The social flood pulse and socio-ecological transformation of the Tonle Sap	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY												The flood pulse is a hydrological concept of the river-lake-floodplain system, demonstrating the varying hydrological regimes between wet and dry seasons, which drive productivity and interaction of living and non-living organisms in river-lake-floodplain systems (RLFS). This paper posits that the flood pulse is a 'social,' physical, and hydrological driver of change in the Mekong Basin, particularly for the 'pulsing heart' of Tonle Sap Lake (TSL). Although the flood pulse provides a comprehensive knowledge of RLFS, there has been less attention on how the flood pulse contributes to the development of river-lake society. This paper examines the social aspects of the flood pulse in RLFS and explores how communities adapt to changing hydrological regimes between the wet and dry seasons. It is argued that the physical and social dimensions of the flood pulse should be essential considerations in water governance, environmental and social policy arenas. It concludes that the flood pulse shapes human settlements in TSL into water-based, water-land-based, and land-based communities, induces vertical and horizontal mobilities of communities between the wet and dry seasons, and influences the organization of productive spaces and non-spatial activities to sustain livelihoods. Developments such as hydropower are causing ecological and social transformations in TSL.					; Sithirith, Mak/I-7144-2019	Mak, Sithirith/0000-0002-9567-6585; 													0129-7619	1467-9493				JAN	2025	46	1					67	94		10.1111/sjtg.12573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sjtg.12573		DEC 2024											WOS:001374672600001

Modern rainfall and lake water isotope data indicate that evaporation is a major control on the isotope value of modern lake waters, consistent with Diss Mere's current status as a small (0.0034 km(2)) and shallow (<6m), closed lake system. However, both the characteristics of isotope data from the interval 4700 to 3700 cal yr BP and the greater depth of the lake basin at that time (>15m water) indicates that whilst evaporation still operated, major shifts in delta O-18 values most likely reflect shifts in patterns of atmospheric circulation (primarily through air mass trajectory, air temperature and precipitation amount). A centennial-scale interval of persistently low delta O-18 values occurred between ca 4320 and 4210 cal yr BP and is interpreted as a cold event with changes in the elemental composition of the sediments supporting this interpretation. Correlation of this record with other sequences from the North Atlantic and western Europe, either through comparison of independent chronologies or age markers such as the Hekla 4 tephra, indicates that this event was well expressed across this region and was characterised by changes in temperature, storminess and ocean/atmospheric circulation. It is argued that increasing evidence exists for an abrupt event in this region at ca 4200 cal yr BP, but it is the high-resolution nature of the Diss Mere sequence and the regionally extensive tephras that this record contains that allows the timing and character of this event to be understood.					; Martin-Puertas, Celia/I-4580-2014	Boyall, Laura/0000-0001-7380-4294; Matthews, Ian/0000-0002-1642-7346; Lincoln, Paul/0000-0003-0566-2970													0277-3791	1873-457X				FEB 1	2025	349								109093	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.109093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.109093		DEC 2024											WOS:001385372200001

The regional coupled ocean-atmosphere model simulation over Eastern Tropical Africa	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS												In this study we examine a 25-year simulation of a Regional Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Model (RCOM) forced by global atmospheric and ocean reanalysis at the lateral boundaries over eastern equatorial Africa which includes parts of the Great Horn of Africa (GHA). It is a first of its kind use of a RCOM for the region. The model shows several observed features of the regional climate with bimodal peaks in the seasonal cycle interspersed with regions of unimodal peak, significant diurnal and intra-seasonal variations of precipitation especially over Lake Victoria and robust seasonal cycle of the upper western India Ocean. Nonetheless the model shows significant dry bias of seasonal precipitation that is persistent throughout the year, which is also reflected at diurnal and intra-seasonal scales. The mixed layer and thermocline depths are found to be shallower in the model simulation suggesting a far more stratified upper western Indian Ocean than the observations indicate.

Spatial comparison of two lake whitefish ( Coregonus clupeaformis) spawning aggregations from the Bay of Quinte and eastern Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake whitefish ( Coregonus clupeaformis) in the Laurentian Great Lakes have experienced major ecological changes and overexploitation throughout the past century. In Lake Ontario, the lake whitefish population was severely reduced and has shown minimal reproductive success since the 1990s. Two spawning aggregations have persisted within the Canadian side of the eastern basin, both of which continue to be targeted by commercial fisheries. The first group utilizes spawning habitat within the Bay of Quinte, while the other uses sections of shoreline on the south side of Prince Edward County in Lake Ontario. There is currently very little known regarding the seasonal distribution of these spawning aggregations, and whether or not they can be considered as isolated groups. Using acoustic telemetry, this study analyzed the spatial distribution and movement patterns of 23 lake whitefish in eastern Lake Ontario to determine whether the two spawning groups were spatially discrete. Spatial analysis revealed clear differences in space use between the spawning aggregations. Mixing of the spawning groups did not occur during the spawning season. Mixing was minimal at other times of the year and primarily occurred in the northwestern area of the eastern basin during August and September. Future research is needed to investigate factors that drive these behavioural differences, and the consequences for stock viability.

The present study discovered the decadal changes in land cover and climate impact on Raja Wetland, revealing significant alterations from 2011 to 2021. The analysis indicates substantial reductions in agricultural land (36.36%), fallow land (30.90%), water spread areas (10.14%) and surrounding wetlands (18.06%). Conversely, settlements, terrestrial vegetation and aquatic macrophytes increased by 19.77%, 3.39% and 1.16%, respectively. The primary driver of wetland shrinkage was urban expansion leading to a decrease in wetland area from 43.39 ha in 2011 to 38.99 ha in 2021. Climate data from 1991 to 2020 show a decreasing trend in annual rainfall (tau = - 0.274, p = 0.035) and an increasing trend in annual temperature (tau = 0.339, p = 0.009), with significant warming particularly during the monsoon months. The wetland's physicochemical attributes fluctuate seasonally, with eutrophic conditions prevailing (TSI range: 61.41-80.36). Notably, fish diversity is impacted by the dominance of the invasive species Oreochromis niloticus, which constitutes 89.31% of the catch. The established planktonic indicator genera of organic pollution were found to be abundant throughout the study period. These, combined with urban pollution and eutrophication, have led to a reduction in native fish species and overall aquatic health. The study highlights the urgent need for conservation measures to address the ecological imbalance and restore wetland resilience amidst ongoing climate and anthropogenic pressures. The communication also proposes various recommendations for the recovery and sustainable future use of wetland fisheries in the context of ongoing changes.

Defining depth requirements to conserve fish assemblages from water take in an intermittent river	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												River systems once safeguarded from water development are being developed. This includes intermittent rivers that annually dry to a series of pools. Describing fish species relationships between abundance and pool depth can help managers set water-take rules that protect fish in dry-season pools. We sampled fish in main-channel and floodplain pools that spanned a gradient of depths and overcame sampling challenges by accounting for interacting effects of species mean length, environmental attributes, and sampling attributes on fish capture probabilities. Fish abundance-depth relationships varied systematically with species mean length, mesohabitat type (main channel, floodplain), water turbidity, and structural complexity, highlighting system complexity and the potential generality of abundance-depth relationships. Similarly, fish length moderated the effects of environmental attributes on capture probability for all sampling methods. We evaluated impacts of hypothetical water-take regulations on fish species' distributions. Results suggested that water-take rules prohibiting draining of main-channel pools below 1.65 m and reducing floodplain pools by no more than 14% minimises impacts to species' distributions, promoting conservation of the fish community. Additionally, our approach demonstrates the capacity of species length for predicting distributional and sampling patterns of fish species.

Influence of barrier beach dynamics on ecological indicator taxa in north-central Lake Ontario coastal wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Adaptive management of protected coastal wetlands requires an understanding of barrier dynamics over long timescales as well as feedbacks with ecosystem processes. In this study, we examined diatom (siliceous algae) and Cladocera (crustacean zooplankton) subfossil remains preserved in sediments as (paleo)ecological indicators of barrier beach dynamics in coastal wetlands along the north-central shore of Lake Ontario. Sediments integrate information across seasons and habitats, accounting for spatiotemporal variability in ecological indicator taxa that is often missed in contemporary sampling efforts. Subfossil remains also allow for reconstruction of historical changes before contemporary monitoring began. We found that small benthic Fragilariaceae diatom taxa were most abundant in high-closure barrier beach wetlands, and were uncommon in drowned river mouth wetlands, while Cladocera assemblages did not reflect coastal wetland hydrogeomorphology. A high-resolution paleoecological study of McLaughlin Bay, a high-closure barrier beach wetland, showed that the abundance of small benthic Fragilariaceae decreased, and diatom diversity increased, when the barrier was breached in 2005 and 1954. Recent increases in small benthic Fragilariaceae were consistent with assessments by the local conservation authority that McLaughlin Bay has become less connected to Lake Ontario in recent years, lending support to artificial barrier beach manipulation as a strategy to improve water quality. Barrier beach dynamics create a natural disturbance regime that is important for maintaining biodiversity and water quality in protected coastal wetlands. Our study provides an approach to monitor and investigate coupled physical-ecological dynamics of barrier beach coastal wetlands over decadal to centennial timescales.

Seasonal variations in the accumulation of weather-driven element content were determined using high-resolution Synchrotron Radiation X-Ray Fluorescence (SR-XRF) analysis of the annual layers in the solid prepare. The results were utilized to approximate the regional paleo-temperature of both lakes and the water level of Lake Van. Visual counting of the varve as well as annual oscillation of measured geochemical series was employed to create a time scale. The element content series were synchronized with recent changes in external climatic environments and lake water level fluctuations. Subsequently, the geochemical series were transformed into climate units, using calibration on synchronous meteorological data. Finally, the original quantitative reconstruction of the regional climate variations was performed over the last millennium period with annual time resolution; for Lake Er & ccedil;ek (840 years ago) and Lake Van (1300 years ago). It was revealed that the sediments of these adjacent lakes (Lake Van and Lake Er & ccedil;ek), located 30 km apart from each other, provided synchronous responses to regional environmental changes, which confirmed the reliability of the reconstructions.

Variability of Zooplankton in Two Neighboring Tropical High-Mountain Lakes	DIVERSITY-BASEL												High-mountain lakes (HMLs) El Sol and La Luna are located 600 m apart in the crater of the Nevado de Toluca volcano, yet they display distinct differences in their morphometry and limnology. This study aimed to compare the zooplankton communities in these two lakes. El Sol harbored 31 zooplankton taxa, while La Luna had only 11. Notably, only four taxa were shared. The zooplankton abundance and biomass were lower than those in other tropical HMLs. La Luna's zooplankton abundance was just 10% of El Sol's, and its biomass was only 3%. Copepods dominated El Sol, while cladocerans dominated La Luna. The tropical seasonality (rainy and dry) was evident in meteorological and limnological variables but not in zooplankton; no seasonal patterns were observed in taxonomic richness, abundance, or biomass. No specific factors could explain the temporal dynamics in either lake. The extreme conditions in La Luna (e.g., lower pH and increased UV exposure) likely explained the differences between both lakes. The introduction of rainbow trout in El Sol during the 1950s may have also played a role.

Spatial distribution patterns of invasive silver carp can inform removal efforts in an oxbow lake of the Mississippi River	MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Oxbow lakes are highly productive waterbodies that host multiple life stages of many freshwater aquatic species. These lakes also provide foraging and rearing habitat to the invasive silver carp ( Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) enabling populations to grow in biomass and abundance that can add propagule pressure to connected waterways and oxbows within the Mississippi River Basin. Ecologically these fish are undesirable because they overlap in diet and may compete for resources with native fishes and negatively impact recreational fisheries. Our goal was to evaluate silver carp distribution patterns in a major Mississippi River oxbow lake to inform removal programs and precision harvesting. We implanted 35 adult silver carp with acoustic tags and released them into the lake. Periodic tracking over 365 d revealed that fish were predominantly found in lake areas with water depths ranging from 2.0 to 5.9 m during all seasons, despite the availability of shallower and deeper water. Silver carp tended to aggregate in the wintertime (December-February) relative to other seasons. This information about lake area uses and seasonal aggregations could inform removal efforts in invaded waterbodies by exploiting natural behavioral and temporal vulnerabilities of this highly invasive and difficult-to-capture fish.

Historically, this has taken place through a combination of ship-based sampling, buoy measurements, and physical models. However, these approaches have spatial and temporal deficiencies which can be improved upon through satellite remote sensing. This study details a new approach for using long time series of satellite remote sensing data to identify historical and near real-time anomalies across a range of data products. Anomalies are traditionally detected as deviations from historical climatologies, typically assuming that there are no long-term trends in the historical data. However, if present, such trends could result in misclassifying ordinary events as anomalous or missing actual anomalies. The new anomaly detection method explicitly accounts for long-term trends and seasonal variability by first decomposing a 10-plus year data record of satellite remote sensing-derived Great Lakes water quality parameters into seasonal, trend, and remainder components. Anomalies were identified as differences between the observed water quality parameter from the model-derived expected value. Normalizing the anomalies to the mean and standard deviation of the full model remainders, the relative anomaly product can be used to compare deviations across parameters and regions. This approach can also be used to forecast the model into the future, allowing for the identification of anomalies in near real time. Multiple case studies are detailed, including examples of a harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie, a sediment plume in Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron), and a phytoplankton bloom in Lake Superior. This new approach would be best suited for use in a water quality dashboard, allowing users (e.g., water quality managers, the research community, and the public) to observe historical and near real-time anomalies.

Such investigations also provide theoretical support for carbon sink monitoring, energy conservation, emission reduction and low-carbon development in the western arid zone and are important for obtaining an in-depth understanding of the carbon cycle, as well as for ecosystem management, restoration and the reconstruction of arid areas. In this study, during the growing season (from May to October) of 2022, the LI-8100A automated soil CO2 flux system was used to measure the soil respiration rate (Rs), temperature from 1.5 m above the surface to depths of 5-25 cm (T, T-5, T-10, T-15, T-20 and T-25) and the soil moisture content (SM) at a depth of 20 cm in four types of grasslands: lowland meadow, alpine meadow, temperate desert steppe and temperate steppe desert. Five replicates were established for each plot, and the responses of Rs to T and SM were fitted to construct the optimal regression model. The results revealed that (1) the daily average soil respiration was highest in the lowland meadow (0.07 to 5.76 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1)), followed by the alpine meadow (-0.57 to 0.95 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1)), the temperate desert steppe (-0.45 to 3.0 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1)) and the temperate steppe desert (-1.29 to 1.61 mu mol<middle dot>m(-2)<middle dot>s(-1)); (2) the soil respiration rates of the four grassland types were significantly correlated with the temperature in the 5-15 cm soil layer, and the best model was an exponential function; the peak values generally appeared between 13:00 and 17:00 (h), with the minimum values at 2:00 or 8:00 (h); the maximum value was observed in July-August, and the minimum value was observed in October; and the soil respiration in the lowland meadow was higher than that in the other three types of grassland during the same period. The average variation intensities of the soil respiration from May to October were as follows: temperate steppe desert (91.78%) > temperate desert steppe (76%) > alpine meadow (58.77%) > lowland meadow (43.93%). (3) The partial correlation analysis revealed that when soil temperature was used as a control, the correlation between SM and soil respiration in the four types of grasslands changed, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) increased to varying degrees, explaining up to 80% of the variation in the soil respiration in the lowland meadows.

Communal roosting began during the colder months from late October to mid-March. The dragonflies roosted 2-4 m above the ground on slender vines such as Bauhinia championii, Dalbergia benthamii, Hiptage benghalensis, and Pothos chinensis, under open canopies along a forest path. The aggregations exhibited a sex ratio predominantly skewed towards males and their numbers were negatively correlated with daily mean temperature, indicating that more dragonflies roost as temperatures decrease. The dragonflies showed fidelity to specific roosts and vines. Roosting began between 15:30 h and 17:00 h CST (UTC+8) when light intensity was high (252-3 607 lux). They departed between 08:50 h and 12:00 h, 2-6 hours after sunrise, with light levels ranging from 1 103 to 9 567 lux. The mechanisms and adaptive value of this behaviour remain open to speculation.

J	Choi, S; Kim, DH				Choi, Seongeun; Kim, Dong Hyeon			Assessing Operational Efficiency of Bubble Plumes for Water Circulation Enhancement	WATER												Bubble plumes are essential for promoting mass transfer, flow, and mixing in water bodies by generating vertical circulation via buoyancy forces. They are widely used in various applications, such as restoring water environments and improving the conditions at the bottom of lakes and reservoirs. For example, thermal stratification in lakes can lead to environmental issues such as the depletion of dissolved oxygen. To address this problem, bubble plume systems have been used to destratify lakes and reservoirs. However, few studies have been performed on the effectiveness of bubble plumes. In this study, the impact of a bubble plume in a dam reservoir was assessed using a numerical model based on high-resolution field measurements. Vertical profiles were obtained before and after the operation of the density-current generator to capture seasonal changes in the water characteristics. These measurements indicated the alteration of the vertical structure and mixing within the water column due to the bubble plume while stable temperatures were maintained at specific depths across seasons. Numerical simulations using large eddy simulations were conducted to analyze the dynamics and mixing efficiency of the bubble plume. The findings of this study provide valuable data for optimizing the design and operational strategies of bubble plume systems in lakes and reservoirs, which can increase the water mixing efficiency and support environmental management.																				2073-4441				DEC	2024	16	23							3538	10.3390/w16233538	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16233538													WOS:001377445700001

However, current pesticide applications are now considered to contribute significantly to the contamination of surface water resources, which may result in severe impacts on biodiversity and the environment. This study examined the presence and mobility risk of pesticides in the surface waters of the Lebna watershed in northeastern Tunisia, a rainfed Mediterranean agricultural region. Water samples were collected from eight hilly reservoirs and the Lebna dam over three farming seasons (2017-2018, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021) and analyzed for 469 pesticide active ingredients (PAIs). According to the field questionnaire, local farmers used 44 PAIs, including 15 herbicides, 21 fungicides, and 8 insecticides. Seventeen pesticide molecules were detected, with glyphosate (1.73 mu g L-1) and 2,4-D (0.23 mu g L-1) being the most prevalent. Despite toxicity indexes, which classify a threat of pesticides as low to moderate, their concentrations may now exceed European standards for drinking water and endanger aquatic life. According to the Pesticide Impact Rating Index (PIRI), PAIs can be organized into three mobility risk categories: medium to high for 2,4-D and glyphosate, low for five PAIs, and very low for 13 undetected PAIs. This work provides the first assessment of pesticide contamination in surface waters of the Cap Bon region, raising concerns about water quality in a low-input agrochemical system and increasing interest in similar contexts.

Three sets of water samples were collected from 10 sites for these analyses. Some physicochemical parameters were measured in situ using multiparameter equipment (HANNA 8289). The data were subjected to analyses of significant difference by an independent sample t-test. Correlation and principal component analysis conducted between variables Temperature, salinity, total dissolved solids (TDS), resistivity, and turbidity showed a strong seasonal variation among sites. Mean Chl a concentration (3.7-48.29 mu g/L for dry and 0.1-20.1 mu g/L for rainy season) revealed that most sites were eutrophic, with the Euglenophycean index less than 1 in all the sites. Phytoplankton species richness exhibited seasonal and spatial variation, with a total of 74 taxa and 51 taxa for the dry and rainy seasons, respectively. The division Bacillariophyta was the most abundant, with 19 families and 24 species during the dry season and 17 families and 16 species during the rainy season. Other phytoplankton divisions present included Chlorophyta > Cyanophyta > Charophyta > > Myzozoa > Euglenophyta in the dry season; the less diverse divisions in the rainy season were Rhodophyta > Cryptophyta > Xanthophyta > Euglenophyta. High concentrations of nutrients and the presence of eutrophic species such as Microcystis aeruginosa suggest pollution and a need to monitor activities carried out along the water course with respect to the quantity and quality of industrial effluents discharged into the stream. The observed eutrophication explains the noxious odor across the city of Douala, especially during the dry season. The human health implications could be severe, with communities dependent on this contaminated stream for fish and other necessities a scenario that repeats itself in communities dependent on urban wetlands in industrial zones globally.																			1088-1913	1520-6483				DEC	2024	34	2							e22324	10.1002/tqem.22324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tqem.22324													WOS:001577982100001

Estimation of Indicators of Phytoplankton Development and Water Quality of Peipsi-Pskov Lake in Modern Conditions	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Currently, the acute problem of pollution of the hydrosphere, which results in a drop in the stability of ecosystems, destruction of the signaling links of biocenoses, and food pyramid violation, is of great importance. The results of our monitoring of the current state of phytoplankton communities and water quality of Peipsi-Pskov Lake, a large transboundary reservoir located in the northwestern part of Pskov oblast are presented. During the growing season of 2022, 221 phytoplankton taxa with ranks below the genus from eight phylums were identified. The average abundance of phytoplankton over the entire period of our study was 11.6 million cells/L, and the average biomass was 1.6 g/m(3). An ecological and geographical analysis was carried out, according to which widespread freshwater planktonic forms of microalgae predominated in the lake, preferring stagnant-flowing weakly alkaline waters. According to the Sj & ouml;rensen-Chekanovsky index, the degree of commonality of the species composition of the planktonic algal flora in Pskov and Peipsi lakes was 73.2%. Saprobiological analysis showed that the waters of the study area in 2022 were slightly polluted (class II of water quality).																			1062-3590	1608-3059				DEC	2024	51	10					3041	3049		10.1134/S1062359024700808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359024700808													WOS:001441528800024

These interactions are important in controlling lake water residence time, aqueous biogeochemistry, and water availability for downstream communities and ecosystems. To better comprehend the complexity of spatio-temporal variations in the aquifer-lake domain in tropical volcanic regions, a multi-tracer approach including water and inorganic carbon stable isotopes (delta 2H, delta 18O, delta 13CDIC), hydrochemistry, and 222Rn was applied in Lake Hule, northern Costa Rica. Seasonal isotope mass balance calculations using lake, stream, precipitation, and groundwater compositions were supplemented with local hydrometeorological information. Evaporation to inflow ratios (E/I) revealed a small variability between the dry (December-April) and wet seasons (May-November), with relatively low evaporation losses, 2.9 +/- 1.0 % and 3.2 +/- 1.8 %, respectively. Bayesian end-member analysis indicated that annual inputs from groundwater, precipitation, and runoff represented 61.3 +/- 8.1%, 24.4 +/- 8.4, and 14.3 +/- 5.9% of total lake inflow, respectively. Temporal variations of delta 13CDIC confirmed the key role volcanic carbonate buffering plays in this lake and indicated greater CO2 degassing from groundwater sources in the wet season. This tracer-aided assessment in a volcanic lake maar of northern Costa Rica provides evidence of previously unknown groundwater-surface water interactions and illustrates the application of isotopic tools for estimating water balances and seasonal variability of groundwater discharge into natural lakes across the volcanic front of Central America.

Soo (Orchidaceae) on the Southern Border of the Range in the Volga-Kama Reserve (Republic of Tatarstan)	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Fluctuation dynamics (studied for 9-27 years) of the abundance, density, age, and spatial structure of the Dactylorhiza maculata (L.) Soo population on Lake Dolgoe of the Volga-Kama Reserve reflects the mechanisms of maintaining the population at the southern border of the range. The data were stored into the database. Abiotic and biotic factors of transitional shrub-sedge sphagnum bogs are the most suitable for the conservation of a rare species, where boreal and arctoboreal species are preserved, and favorable microsites are open and moist areas of the mire, with pH 4.1-4.5. The biodiversity of sphagnum mosses in the habitats of Dactylorhizamaculata is represented by nine species, where the carpet species is Sphagnumangustifolium, and Sphagnum divinum appears in open and wet microareas and Sphagnum centrale appears in areas overgrown with open forest. A significant relationship of the species abundance with climatic factors is revealed: a positive relationship with precipitation and a negative relationship with average temperatures of the growing season. The number of reproductive D. maculata does not depend on precipitation in moist microsites. Age stages are reliably identified using the morphometric parameters of vegetative and reproductive plants: juvenile (j), immature (im), virginal (v), young reproductive (g1), and mature reproductive (g2). The ontogenetic spectrum is 11.5: 17: 29: 42.5 (j: im: v: g), and the proportion of prereproductive individuals fluctuated between 57-66% in the period of 9-27 years of study due to a high percentage of fruit formation (up to 60%). The spatial distribution of individuals is predominantly clustered, consisting of aggregations with a radius of 0.5-1.2 m, distributed randomly. The dynamics of spatial mosaics, accompanied by the migration of seeds and individuals of D. maculata to favorable microsites, is a natural compensatory resistance mechanism that ensures the dynamic balance of the population.

Younus			Trophic status analysis and nutrient source allocation in urban lakes of Dhaka, Bangladesh: a comprehensive approach to eutrophication monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Urban lakes are vital to ecosystems, providing essential services and recreational spaces in densely populated megacities. However, rapid urbanization and anthropogenic activities, particularly eutrophication driven by macronutrient accumulation, severely threaten these water bodies. This study underscores the critical need for continuous trophic state monitoring to sustain fish, wildlife, and plant ecosystems. The trophic status of Dhanmondi, Gulshan, and Banani Lakes in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, was assessed using Carlson's Trophic State Index (CTSI) and Burn's Trophic Level Index (BTLI), based on chlorophyll a (Chl-a), total phosphorus (TP), Secchi disc depth (SD), and total nitrogen (TN). Water samples from five sites per lake were analyzed for physicochemical parameters from June 2023 to May 2024, revealing monthly and seasonal variations. The study revealed that Dhanmondi Lake's CTSI ranged from 69.3 to 79.5 (June 2023 to March 2024), indicating initial "Eutrophic" conditions progressing to "Hypereutrophic." Gulshan Lake consistently showed "Hypereutrophic" conditions, with CTSI values between 84.1 and 97.3. Banani Lake was "Eutrophic" in June and July 2023, transitioning to "Hypereutrophic" from August 2023 to May 2024 (84.1-97.7). The Trophic Level Index (TLI) showed the "Hypereutrophic" status with a progressive monthly escalation for all the lakes. The Water Quality Index (WQI) categorized the lakes as "Poor" to "Very Poor" from June to August 2023, becoming "Unsuitable" from September 2023 to May 2024, indicating significant anthropogenic stress. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified nutrient infiltration, soil erosion, waste discharge, and organic residue accumulation as key pollution drivers. The study advocates for a multi-sectoral strategy to regulate nutrient loading and mitigate eutrophication, emphasizing best management practices for urban lake conservation.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2024	196	12							1252	10.1007/s10661-024-13419-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-13419-y								39589564					WOS:001364182700005

Environ Sci Pollut Res 20(11):7520-7533, 2013), the filling process of the old Meirama mining pit (NW Spain), as well as the methodology used in the sample collection and analysis, was described. Likewise, the evolution of the temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, iron, and manganese in the filling and postfilling processes are shown. This second article presents the temporal evolution of other major components and nutrients during the filling period (2008-2016) and postfilling period (2016-2019). The continuation of the analysis initiated in the aforementioned article is done at certain heights of the vertical profiles monitored at the midpoint of the lake (the surface, the first 2 m of depth with respect to the surface (2 mbs), at 59 masl, and at the bottom (2 masl)). As explained in the filling process, an invariant chemocline and a seasonal thermocline near the water surface are formed. Therefore, the analysis encompasses not only the bottom and surface of the lake but also includes an intermediate point where the chemocline is found. Based on the analysis carried out, it has been possible to verify that the most superficial waters (80 m) are in line with the geological and fluvial environment of the basin, so that the stored waters do not need a special physicochemical treatment. However, at deeper levels, anoxization processes are developing, a step prior to the methanization of the lake bottom.					juncosa, ricardo/AAC-9109-2019; Delgado Martin, Jordi/H-7819-2015	Delgado Martin, Jordi/0000-0002-8261-8087													1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2024	83	23							648	10.1007/s12665-024-11972-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-024-11972-w													WOS:001357884900004

The present study investigated the fish production trend, SIF diversity, and role of environmental and climatic parameters in Beledanga, a floodplain wetland in lower Ganges, through the sampling and collection of data from the local fishermen cooperative society. The fish catch composition in the wetland shifted after 2019, with the increased Ctenopharyngodon idella (grass carp) contribution from 11% to 17% due to the introduction of in situ seed-raising technology of an HDPE (high-density polyethylene) pen culture system. The fish fingerling stocking has a profound impact on fish production (R2 = 0.60, p = 0.007). During the study period, 19 species of SIF were recorded, with a higher abundance observed in the monsoon season. The naturally occurring SIF contributed 16% of the total fish catch, with the highest catch in 2011 (11,970 kg). Water pH and phosphate content are the two most important environmental parameters that influence SIF. The generalized additive model (GAM) indicated that the optimum annual rainfall for fish production in the wetland was between 750 and 1250 mm. The average annual fish production of 43,017 kg through stocking and SIF support the livelihood and nutritional security of the fishers. As the SIF showed a decreasing trend of production, habitat protection, scientific stocking, and in situ enclosure culture are recommended for sustainable enhancement of fish production and to conserve the SIF diversity.

Study Focus: This study explores the impacts of climate change and human activities on the inflow of the Aral Sea and Lake Balkhash, revealing the different driving factors behind the evolution of inland lakes in arid environments. To achieve this, we propose a novel approach that combines classical seasonal decomposition with Random Forest and Factor Analysis (CD-RF-FA) to quantitatively assess the influences of climate change and human activities on lake inflow. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: During the period from 1960 to 1990, anthropogenic factors predominantly influenced the inflow to the lakes, contributing 89.9 %, 91.8 %, and 91.6 % to the Lake Balkhash Basin (BAK), the Syr Darya Basin (SYR), and the Amu Darya Basin (AMU), respectively. However, from 1991 to 2020, the influence of human activities diminished, and climate variables gradually dominated the changes in inflow, contributing 52.2 % and 47.2 % to BAK and SYR, respectively, with upstream inflow being the main driving factor. Additionally, reservoir construction and political factors also played significant roles in the variation of inflow, exerting direct or indirect effects. This study provides crucial insights into the complex interplay of factors affecting inland lakes in arid regions and informs strategies to mitigate the Aral Sea Syndrome.

JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater floodplain lake in China. Study focus: Marshlands in a floodplain, as the typical natural wetland offering vital habitats for various organisms, are sensitive to environmental changes. The spatiotemporal changes of marshlands were investigated and their driving forces from both natural factors and human activities were discussed. The remote sensing image data from 1973 to 2022 was adopted to explore the long-term changes of marshlands exposed in dry season. New hydrological insights for the region: Over the past fifty years, the total area of marshlands in Poyang Lake is around 2540-2718 km(2) and has undergone substantial changes. It follows the bell-shaped curve pattern with continuous rise since 1970s and reach the maximum at the end of 20 century and then fluctuating decline. Different evolutionary patterns were identified in different lake regions owing to the combination of human activities and natural processes. The expanding marshlands mainly concentrate in the central lake, while the significant losses of marshlands are observed in the northern lake (By sand mining and dyke constructions). In the southern lake, sediment input from inflow rivers deposited naturally in the river mouth elevated the lake bed and lead to delta expansion (A 3.1 km expansion has been observed). The complex geomorphological processes and fishery activities also create the dish-shaped internal sub-lakes in marshlands.

Ensuring their proper exploitation requires constant drainage of the rock mass and the transfer of mine waters to rivers. Several technical solutions are used to prevent the adverse effects of saltwater discharge on the river ecosystem. One such solution is adapting the post-mining reservoirs into mine water settling basins. This article characterises two such facilities-the "Gliniok" and "Hubertus I" reservoirs. The physicochemical properties of their waters were analysed both when they served as settling basins and after their decommissioning. During their exploitation, the waters of the settling basins showed high salinity (>10 g/L). It was revealed that these basins turned into freshwater reservoirs very quickly after decommissioning. A sudden decrease in the electrolytic conductivity and the concentration of main cations and anions in the water was observed. The mixing processes also changed. The reservoirs were transformed from meromictic to polymictic. The processes that led to them turning into freshwater basins differed in the studied settling basins. The transformation of the Gliniok settling basin into a freshwater reservoir was a unique process, draining brines into the rock mass through cracks and crevices. The formation of cracks and crevices was a consequence of high-energy mining tremors. It is the first known case of this type in the world.					; Dyczko, Artur/GON-7386-2022; Woźniak, Gabriela/AAG-1731-2019	Wozniak, Gabriela/0000-0003-1936-2880; Dyczko, Artur/0000-0001-6387-5339; Bacler-Zbikowska, Barbara/0000-0003-4139-6307														2076-3417				DEC	2024	14	23							10814	10.3390/app142310814	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app142310814													WOS:001376872900001

The research results showed that photosynthesis is characterized by two or three seasonal maxima, the values of which are within the limits of oligotrophic ecosystems. The main primary producers, the concentration of phosphorus in water, and the water temperature during the growing season are considered. Differences in the seasonal dynamics of photosynthesis and a similar level of seasonal average and maximum values were revealed in comparison with the deep-water region of the lake. The small contribution of littoral phytoplankton production to the primary productivity of the ecosystem is shown.

Satellite Estimation of River Water Level from Shoal Monitoring Data: the Case of the Transboundary Ili River (Central Asia)	COSMIC RESEARCH												Lowland rivers flowing through the loess rocks carry large quantities of suspended materials and experience active processes of channel deformation (meandering). A large number of shoals, as a result of sediment deposition, exist in the riverbeds. Shoals often change, especially during the period of high water. Such rivers do not have stable hydrological profiles, and so satellite estimates of their water content are of great practical interest. During the period of low water, the morphology of the riverbed is relatively stable and the shoals are in a semisubmerged state. Under these conditions, the proportion of flooding of shoals is very sensitive to the river water level, which creates favorable conditions for the development of satellite methods for assessing water levels. The study examined the Ili River in Central Asia with an annual outflow of about 12 km(3), which is main tributary of the large Lake Balkhash. The informative value of Sentinel-2 data (resolution 10 m) in the task of assessing water level in the river in conditions of relative low water was shown. 179 cloudless Sentinel-2 satellite images were selected for the period from April to November 2018-2022. An additional criterion for choosing the image was the water level at the Ili-Dobyn hydropost of Kazhydromet less than 280 cm. This water level was typical for about 80% of the time of the low-water period of 2018-2022. The Ili riverbed on the border of China and Kazakhstan with a length of about 40 km was used to create the shoal (sediments) mask with a total area above 4 km(2). The MNDWI1 (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) water index and its threshold value of +0.25 were used to identify the "water" class on the shoal mask. The proportion of flooded shoals was compared with ground data from the Ili-Dobyn hydrographic station on the water level during the satellite's flight. For the April-November period, linear dependences were obtained between the proportion of shoals flooding and the river water level. The reliability of the linear approximation for seasonal data was high and varied from R-2 = 0.83 (2022) to 0.96 (2020). The entire period (2018-2022) of the analysis was characterized by R-2 = 0.93. The use of the linear regression equation as a model for predicting the water level in the river based on the proportion of flooding of test shoals provided a sufficiently high value (0.74) of the Nash-Sutcliffe hydrological forecasting efficiency parameter, which indicates the practical significance of the developed methodology.

In this lake, 11 genetically distinct rotifer species occurred abundantly during the study period. Some of the species occurred in the same seasons and overlapped strongly in their temporal niche space, while others did not. Analyses showed that phylogenetic distance among the rotifer species was significantly and positively correlated with temporal niche overlap, suggesting that genetically similar species occupy different temporal niche spaces, probably as a result of avoiding competitive interactions. Although most pairs of species that showed significant partitioning in their realized niche often occurred in the same environmental ranges in terms of seston P and chlorophyll-a concentrations and water stagnation conditions, the range of temperatures in which each of these two species occurred was significantly less overlapping. These results suggest that the current or past competitive interactions play a crucial role in determining the structure of the rotifer community and its temporal dynamics, and that water temperature is the most important niche axis partitioning the realized niche among the rotifer species.					; Urabe, Jotaro/ACO-1029-2022; Makino, Wataru/GLS-2518-2022	Perera, Ishara/0000-0002-6066-3637; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2025	26	1					211	222		10.1007/s10201-024-00771-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-024-00771-8		NOV 2024											WOS:001367095300001

Spatiotemporal Variation in Dissolved, Bioavailable, and Particulate Elements and the Abundance of Harmful Algae in Grand Lake	ACS ES&T WATER												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are often linked to the increased loading of limiting nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Little is known about the relevance of other biogenic elements, the supplies of which are spatiotemporally heterogeneous, on HABs. We measured the dissolved, bioavailable, and particulate concentrations of 26 elements at four locations draining different catchments of a large reservoir during three seasons, in addition to the total abundance of phytoplankton and % of cyanobacteria. Finally, we manipulated a key element (Fe) in microcosms to test its effect on the community. Phytoplankton abundance and community structure varied spatiotemporally, with minimal variation in N/P. The variation in environmental supplies of several other elements was correlated with phytoplankton abundance, as well as up to 3 orders of magnitude differences in cyanobacterial yield. Bioassays manipulating Fe impacted total phytoplankton as well as the abundance of cyanobacteria, with Fe-chelated treatments resulting in a significant decline in phytoplankton as well as cyanobacterial yield. In summary, we found substantial heterogeneity in elemental supplies that are relevant to the phytoplankton community. Exploring the relevance of the entire system of elements in the context of HABs may be more rewarding than studies emphasizing a subset of elements.

Population characteristics, seasonal distribution, and suppression potential of introduced Northern Pike in a Great Plains stream	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												ObjectiveThe objectives of this study were to describe the population dynamics, reproductive characteristics, and movement of Northern Pike Esox lucius in the Niobrara River drainage of Wyoming. This information was used to estimate the necessary level of suppression to meaningfully reduce their abundance and thereby facilitate persistence of native nongame fishes.MethodsIn 2019 and 2020, Northern Pike were sampled to describe population size structure, age structure, growth, and mortality. An additional 42 gravid female Northern Pike were collected across 2020-2023 to determine a length-fecundity relationship. Vulnerability to recruitment overfishing was modeled with a static spawning potential ratio model. Finally, 15 mature fish were implanted with radio transmitters in 2021 and 2022 and tracked for 1 year to determine seasonal dispersal and spawning locations.ResultSampled Niobrara River drainage Northern Pike (n = 213) varied from 127 to 749 mm total length. Estimated ages of fish were between 0 and 8 years, and total annual mortality was estimated at 42% (95% confidence interval = 36-48%) in the presumed absence of fishing mortality. Recruitment was extremely stable, and growth was relatively fast through age 2. Some females matured at age 1, and all females were mature by age 2 and spawned annually. Estimated total fecundity for females between 297 and 914 mm total length varied from 3573 to 154,877 eggs. Most telemetered fish moved little throughout the year, but movements as large as 5.9 river kilometers were observed. Modeling suggests that exploitation of age-1 and older Northern Pike should exceed 42% and exploitation of age-2 and older fish should exceed 85% to meaningfully reduce the population's reproductive potential.ConclusionNorthern Pike growth and reproductive potential at older ages may be more limited in small prairie streams than within their native range. Observed annual home range was small, and spawning occurred annually in consistent locations. The necessary intensity of mechanical removal to achieve meaningful suppression in this system will likely require an intensive and ongoing interstate effort.

Comparing conventional tagging methods and acoustic telemetry to inform management of Lake Whitefish in Lake Michigan	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective Studies of fish movement using conventional tags or acoustic telemetry have different benefits and biases that can influence how conclusions are used in a management context. Our objective was to determine whether these two methods provided similar inferences regarding movements and spawning site fidelity of Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in Lake Michigan. Additionally, we assessed movement patterns and used telemetry to assess residency time of Lake Whitefish to provide managers with information on which stocks might be exposed to harvest in different regions. Methods Lake Whitefish were tagged during spawning in (1) North and Moonlight bays, (2) Big Bay de Noc, (3) the Menominee River, and (4) the Fox River. Proportions of fish moving between southern Green Bay, northern Green Bay, and Lake Michigan were compared between tag types. Spawning site fidelity was estimated for each tagging site. Seasonal residency indices were calculated using acoustic telemetry detections. Result Estimates differed between the two methods, but overall trends were similar. Fox River fish rarely left southern Green Bay, and fish tagged in North and Moonlight bays rarely entered Green Bay (<10% of individuals). Big Bay de Noc and Menominee River fish moved into other regions more often (>50% of individuals). The residency indices indicated that Big Bay de Noc fish spent most of their time in Lake Michigan while Menominee River fish spent little time in northern Green Bay despite transitioning to the region. Compared to telemetry, conventional tag recoveries underestimated the proportion of individuals moving among regions. Spawning site fidelity estimates (28-100%) varied among tagging groups and between methods. Conclusion Our results suggest that data from conventional tags can inform management at broad geographic scales. However, acoustic telemetry can provide fine-scale information. Information gained from telemetry can be useful in understanding exposure to fishing mortality, which may be valuable for informing management decisions.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023	Izzo, Lisa/0000-0002-2965-5161; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2024	44	6					1232	1248		10.1002/nafm.11040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.11040		NOV 2024											WOS:001364012600001

Lakes declining in the mega-Changjiang River Basin in China. Lake Reserv Manage. XXX-XXX.Global lakes are shrinking due to intensive human interference and climate change. However, a comprehensive understanding of lake variations within mega river systems has been poorly documented. Here, lake dynamics of the mega-Changjiang River Basin (CRB) are explored by multiple images and hydrological observations between 1990 and 2020. The lake area in the CRB declined significantly by 91.58 km2/yr and 101.11 km2/yr in the flood season and dry season, respectively, while the lake number only exhibits an obvious decrease of 0.25 lakes/yr in the flood season. Furthermore, small lakes remain relatively stable, and medium-size lakes experience a minor decline/increase during the flood/dry season, while large lakes exhibit an intensive decrease during the dry season. Lakes in the upper Changjiang increase in area due to glacier melting caused by rising temperatures. Lake area declines in midstream and the lower stream were induced by Changjiang riverbed downcutting triggered by Three Gorges Dam regulation, as well as by large-scale human reclamations. In addition, seasonal differences in precipitation can cause lake size fluctuations from the flood season to the dry season. Our results underscore the response of the lake system to anthropogenic interference and climate change, providing valuable insights for sustainable lake management and protection.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JAN 2	2025	41	1					1	15		10.1080/10402381.2024.2432876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2024.2432876		NOV 2024											WOS:001391890800001

Response of anoxygenic and oxygenic phototrophs to an environmental gradient reveals unusual structure of freshwater microbial communities in the bromeliad ecosystem	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria have recently been recognized as a ubiquitous component of microbial communities in lakes and marine environments, but studies of the ecological factors that control their significance are scarce. We conducted a manipulative field experiment using natural freshwater microcosms, the tank bromeliad ecosystem, to test the response of anoxygenic and oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms to an environmental gradient across the forest edge. We assessed the biomass of these photosynthetic communities by their pigment content and used structural equation modeling to evaluate the importance of different habitat variables as ecological drivers. We show that anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are primarily driven by small detrital organic particles rather than directly by light. In contrast, light and habitat size were the main factors controlling the biomass of oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms. Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria inhabiting the bromeliad ecosystem represent huge concentrations of bacteriochlorophyll a relative to large pelagic environments and form an essential and dominant part of photosynthetic biomass across a wide range of ecological conditions. These freshwater photoheterotrophs are likely to play a pivotal and unsuspected role in energy flow and nutrient cycling in neotropical forests.

Littoral resources, food chain length and top predator size - Are these connected with lake size?	FOOD WEBS												The size of a lake ecosystem sets many direct and indirect physical limits for habitats available for different food web compartments as well as the taxa inhabiting these. We tested the hypotheses that 1) reliance of fish on littoral resources increase in lakes with shoreline development, and 2) food chain length and 3) top predator size increase with lake size. We analyzed food web trophic structure, based on stable isotope analyses (SIA) of carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N), in six boreal lakes in southern and eastern Finland (area 0.13-567 km2). We also applied data from gillnet monitoring of two common predatory fish, perch ( Perca fluviatilis) and pike ( Esox lucius), in >100 lakes as well as data from national large pike (weight > 10 kg) competition. Our results based on SIA did not support the first two hypotheses. Mixing-model results indicated great contribution of littoral resources for many fish, however, showing considerable within-taxa variation for some species. Fish reliance on littoral resources was not directly related to lake shoreline development. The lakes had four trophic levels and large predators coupled both littoral and pelagic habitats. The very rare freshwater pinniped, Saimaa ringed seal ( Pusa hispida saimensis), shared the same trophic position with piscivorous fish. However, we found some support for the third hypothesis. The maximum size of perch was positively correlated with lake size, and the majority (88 %) of very large pikes (>10 kg) were caught from lakes with the area > 1 km2, indicating habitat size importance for large predators.					; Olin, Mikko/I-9258-2012	Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Rissanen, Antti Juhani/0000-0002-5678-3361													2352-2496					DEC	2024	41								e00379	10.1016/j.fooweb.2024.e00379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2024.e00379		NOV 2024											WOS:001366222600001

Based on observations of long-term stable isotopes of soil moisture in the eastern Loess Plateau (ECLP) during the non-rainy season growing period, this study systematically explored soil water evaporation loss at different soil depths using the Craig-Gordon model and revealed the internal relationship between soil evaporation loss and environmental elements. Main fi ndings included: (1) The soil moisture content showed a gradual decreasing trend, with a weak soil moisture 5 18 O fl uctuation appearing in April, whereas a stronger fl uctuation was observed in June. (2) A significant vertical spatial heterogeneity was observed in soil moisture 5 18 O of each soil layer. Enriched soil moisture 5 18 O values appeared in the 0-20 cm soil layer, and the minimum value appeared in the 40-60 cm soil layer. (3) A significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity was observed in the soil moisture evaporation loss fraction (f) (0-23.35%), with weaker values at the beginning of the study period and larger values between mid-late May and mid-June. The largest soil evaporation loss was observed in the 0-20 cm soil layer (average value of 8.97%), a fl uctuating decreasing trend appeared with increasing soil depth. (4) Regional soil moisture evaporation loss was positively correlated with regional air temperature (T) and potential evapotranspiration (ET0) and negatively correlated with soil water content (SWC) and relative humidity (RH). The correlation between soil moisture evaporation loss and environmental elements gradually weakened with increasing soil depth. (5) The environmentally driven model of continuous evaporation of soil moisture was suitable for larger amounts, especially for the surface soil layers. The results of this study have important implications for water resource management, ecosystem stability, and sustainable regional agriculture in the ECLP.

Water samples and environmental parameters (pH, surface temperature, and turbidity) were collected monthly from September 2009 to July 2010. The number of microcystin-synthethase (mcyB) and phycocyanin (PC) gene copies from Microcystis spp was quantified using qPCR. Microcystis PC and mcyB gene copies were measured throughout the study period in the sampling areas, and the non-microcystin-producing strains were predominant. Microcystin-producing copy numbers of Microcystis spp (mcyB) were abundant during the bloom season, reaching the highest levels in January 2010 at Pequenos Libombos dam and Chokwe irrigation channels. Microcystin (MC) concentrations exceeded the WHO guideline of 1 mu g/L for drinking water in some water samples (44 mu g/L). Changes in microcystin profiles were observed during the different seasons and between the water bodies. MC-LR, -RR, -YR, RY, -LA, -[Dha7]-LR, and -[Asp3]-LR were detected in water samples by LC-MS/MS. Generally, MC-LR was the most dominant variant (77% of samples). Considering that Pequenos Libombos dam provides drinking water for the capital Maputo City, these results suggest the need of further studies to evaluate the human health risk associated with MC occurrence.

J	Tsuji, S; Shibata, N				Tsuji, Satsuki; Shibata, Naoki			Particle size distribution shift and diurnal concentration changes of environmental DNA caused by fish spawning behaviour	LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Spawning is one of the most significant aspects of fish life history, so understanding spawning is critical for the conservation and management of species. Recently, an efficient and non-invasive spawning detection method for spawning behaviour has been proposed, utilising the increased environmental DNA (eDNA) concentration and nuclear/mitochondrial eDNA ratio associated with fish spawning. However, little is known about the characteristics and dynamics of sperm-derived eDNA, which is key to detection. This study focused on changes in eDNA particle size distribution (PSD) and concentrations pre-, post-, and during spawning of Ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis (Temminck & Schlegel, 1846). Firstly, PSD changes between pre- and post-spawning were investigated by comparing concentrations and proportions of eDNA obtained from filters with different pore sizes. Second, the diurnal changes in eDNA concentration were monitored at the peak of the spawning season by collecting river water every one or three hours. Results showed that eDNA related to sperm-head size increased at post-spawning, and eDNA concentrations had significant diurnal changes with a peak during the spawning time window. These findings suggest that semi-selective recovery of sperm-derived eDNA based on particle size and/or sampling during the spawning time window with increased concentrations can improve the detection sensitivity of eDNA-based spawning surveys. This study provides essential basic information for advancing eDNA-based spawning surveys and contributes to their further development.																			1860-1871	1860-188X				JAN	2025	21	1					151	161		10.1007/s11355-024-00630-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-024-00630-9		NOV 2024											WOS:001357807100001

The relationship between submerged vegetation and microbial communities has become a key focus in current research. Despite this, the regulation of submerged vegetation density post-restoration remains a topic of debate, and the impact of submerged vegetation density and seasonal variations on microbial communities requires further investigation. A comprehensive study was conducted on different densities of submerged vegetation communities, water physicochemical properties, sediment nutrients, and bacterial communities following a semi-constructed wetland ecological restoration project. The results indicated that the submerged vegetation density of around 50% of the water led to the highest dissolved oxygen (DO) content and a greater number of unique operational taxonomic units. Furthermore, both submerged vegetation density and seasonal changes were found to significantly influence microbial alpha- and beta-diversity. Redundancy analyses indicated that environmental factors explained the variability in bacterial alpha-diversity, accounting for 74.63% of the variation. Particularly, the CODCr content in water was identified as a key environmental factor affecting bacterial alpha-diversity, while DO, pH, turbidity, and total organic carbon in sediment had a significant impact on bacterial alpha-diversity in water. This study advances our understanding of the ecological importance of submerged vegetation restoration and its effects on microbial communities, providing valuable insights for the management of submerged vegetation in wetland ecological restoration processes.					; Wang, Ziming/ITV-2111-2023; Zhang, Congcong/ISU-7455-2023	Jingwen, Hu/0000-0003-0048-3826; 													1061-2971	1526-100X				MAR	2025	33	3								10.1111/rec.14345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.14345		NOV 2024											WOS:001357064700001
J	Bezerra, LAV; Libralato, S; Kubecka, J; Padial, AA				Bezerra, Luis Artur Valoes; Libralato, Simone; Kubecka, Jan; Padial, Andre Andrian			Long-term contamination by non-native fish assemblages in a Neotropical floodplain	PLOS ONE												Biological invasions are a major threat to biodiversity in species-rich regions. Therefore, it is important to understand mechanisms behind the long-term establishment of non-native fish species in aquatic environments in the Neotropical region. Here, we associated fish biomass, species richness, and the proportion of non-native species (contamination and Kempton's indices) to quantify the non-native pressure over fish biodiversity in lakes and rivers of the Parana River floodplain, seasonally, from 2000 to 2017. We divided species into native and non-native assemblages sampled in spatio-temporal gradients. Temporal trends were examined using linear regressions and generalised additive models. Fish biomass in gillnets increased for both native and non-native fish species, but their Kempton indices were inversely correlated. Extinction of native species occurred locally with biotic differentiation of non-native species in lakes, rivers, and ecosystem contamination. A constant increase in fish biomass resulted in overwhelming biodiversity of non-natives at the end of the time series evaluated. Native biotic resistance to introductions was not detected in deterministic trends. The observed patterns were consistent with previous studies showing native biotic homogenisation and extinction of species in response to biological invasions, landscape fragmentation, and riverine impoundments. Increases in abundance and species richness of non-native fish were the biodiversity drivers that resulted in non-native species outweighing native species in the Parana floodplain.

Aiming to characterise the life-history traits in relation to the environmental parameters of the long-whiskered catfish, Mystus aor, a commercially important species from Kaptai Lake, Bangladesh, different life-history data were analysed. The monthly condition factor (K) ranged from 1.15 to 1.41, and the relative condition factor (Kn) ranged from 0.14 to 0.25. The estimated relative fecundity was 18474-55504 eggs/per fish, and the maximal oocyte diameter was found in May (0.83 +/- 0.11 mu m). The lengths at first sexual maturity (Lm) for male and female M. aor were 49.5 cm and 54.1 cm, respectively. The GSI was peaked in May for both males and females, and histological analysis also revealed the presence of yolk granules and several mature spermatids in April and May in both sexes. Analysis of environmental data over 40 years in the Kaptai lake ecosystem indicate the significant increase in the precipitation rate in spawning month which is highly correlated with the spawning season. The findings of the current study will serve as a baseline for the conservation and broodstock management in the Kaptai Lake of Bangladesh.					Zahangir, Md. Mahiuddin/AAL-7501-2021	Zahangir, Dr. Md.

A robust numerical method for the generation and propagation of periodic finite-amplitude internal waves in natural waters using high-accuracy simulations	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS												The design and implementation of boundary conditions for the robust generation and simulation of periodic finite-amplitude internal waves is examined in a quasi two-layer continuous stratification using a spectral-element-method-based incompressible flow solver. The commonly used Eulerian approach develops spurious, and potentially catastrophic small-scale numerical features near the wave-generating boundary in a non-linear stratification when the parameter A/(delta c) is sufficiently larger than unity; A and delta are measures of the maximum wave-induced vertical velocity and pycnocline thickness, respectively, and c is the linear wave propagation speed. To this end, an Euler-Lagrange approach is developed and implemented to generate robust high-amplitude periodic deep-water internal waves. Central to this approach is to take into account the wave-induced (isopycnal) displacement of the pycnocline in both the vertical and (effectively) upstream directions. With amplitudes not restricted by the limits of linear theory, the Euler-Lagrange-generated waves maintain their structural integrity as they propagate away from the source. The advantages of the high-accuracy numerical method, whose minimal numerical dissipation cannot damp the above near-source spurious numerical features of the purely Eulerian case, can still be preserved and leveraged further along the wave propagation path through the robust reproduction of the non-linear adjustments of the waveform. The near- and far-source robustness of the optimized Euler-Lagrange approach is demonstrated for finite-amplitude waves in a sharp quasi two-layer continuous stratification representative of seasonally stratified lakes. The findings of this study provide an enabling framework for two-dimensional simulations of internal swash zones driven by well-developed non-linear internal waves and, ultimately, the accompanying turbulence-resolving three-dimensional simulations.

A case study using Coregonus and Salvelinus	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												While it is likely that ecological context is important, the factors that facilitate and maintain variable levels of intraspecific diversity in Salmonidae fishes across environments remain unclear. Using a meta-analysis of sympatric ecotype assemblages from two salmonid genera-Salvelinus and Coregonus-we evaluated the importance of ecological factors determining the number of sympatric ecotypes (i.e. 2-7) and the level of trait divergence between them. We found that ecotype diversity increased with lake depth and surface area in both Coregonus and Salvelinus. Further, diversity in Coregonus increased with latitude, while the number of ecotypes in Salvelinus assemblages was linked to climatic seasonality. In comparing the two genera, we found elevated divergence in traits related to ontogeny (i.e. age and body shape) in Salvelinus and gill raker count in Coregonus. Trait divergence in life history traits (i.e. age and body length) in Salvelinus increased with seasonality, whereas contrasting relationships of latitude to body length and gill rakers were found in Coregonus. We also found similar levels of divergence in trait variance in the two genera, suggesting that among-ecotype differences in phenotypic variability are not more common in one genus than the other. Overall, ecosystem characteristics, including lake location, climate and morphometry, are clearly important for where these genera have diversified, but the variables that are most closely associated with intraspecific diversity differ between the two genera studied and depend on whether diversity is quantified using number of ecotypes or trait divergence.

Among the species experiencing negative population trajectories in agricultural habitats are meadow and farmland birds, which have suffered a loss in both habitat and food availability in cultivated fields. In Denmark, biotope plans (a requirement to establish small agro-environmental habitats on properties with stocking of game birds) have been implemented as a measure to mitigate biodiversity declines in the agricultural landscape and, in this paper, we investigate to what extent these initiatives fulfil the intended purpose with respect to birds in the breeding season. We demonstrate that some initiatives like hedgerows, areas of open vegetation, scrub, and lakes seemed to increase avian diversity locally, but also that other measures such as vegetation strips, grass strips, and bare soil strips had little effect given the current implementation of these initiatives. Benefitting species were mostly scrub- and woodland species that now inhabited previously open landscapes after the establishment of suitable habitats, and the initiatives failed to show clear positive effects on meadow birds and farmland birds for which they were originally intended. The most commonly registered species in our data set was (released) Pheasant Phasianus colchicus, which emphasised that the stocking of game birds can have a clear effect on avian species composition in areas where this practice is exercised. Future studies are needed to clarify how this stocking may affect local biodiversity of different taxonomic groups					; Flojgaard, Camilla/MGV-8970-2025; Clausen, Kevin/J-5683-2013; Heldbjerg, Henning/GRF-3351-2022; Clausen, Kevin Kuhlmann/J-5683-2013	Heldbjerg, Henning/0000-0003-4268-2671; Flojgaard, Camilla/0000-0002-5829-8503; Clausen, Kevin Kuhlmann/0000-0003-3636-5442													0959-2709	1474-0001				NOV 4	2024	34								e33	10.1017/S0959270924000224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0959270924000224													WOS:001347398300001

While the community compositions were homogenous in surface waters with the dominance of Candidatus Pelagibacter, diversity showed high vertical variation due to salinity and dissolved oxygen gradients. Anoxic conditions occurred at deeper parts of the lagoon, particularly at 14 m and 18 m, where nutrient enrichment and high H2S concentration were detected resulting in a shift of bacterial community to anoxic species. Sulfurimonas, Sulfurovum, and Desulfobacula were dominant genera at 14 m and 18 m where the H2S concentration was high. The community composition of the sediment did not change over seasons, dominated by Syntrophus species. The insights gained from this study may contribute to understanding how dissolved oxygen, H2S concentrations and salinity drive bacterial community structure in euxinic ecosystems especially the dominance of anoxic bacteria.

Rapid growth of a locally-endemic tilapia may enable persistence in an African lake invaded by Nile tilapia	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The introduction of non-native species can lead to competition with native species for key resources, driving the decline and extinction of endemic biodiversity. Recently, a newly discovered and evolutionarily distinct lineage of Korogwe tilapia (Oreochromis korogwe) was reported from small lakes in southern Tanzania. This small-bodied lineage is potentially threatened by introduced Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an invasive large-bodied congeneric with a pan-tropical non-native distribution. Nile tilapia is known to dominate ecologically-similar native tilapia in competitive interactions, preventing access to resources such as food and shelter. We therefore hypothesised that competition between Nile tilapia and Korogwe tilapia could limit access to resources by the native species and hence reduce their growth rate, a key determinant of fitness. In this study, tilapia were collected from Lake Rutamba in two field seasons, and individuals were classified using microsatellite DNA genotypes as O. niloticus, O. korogwe or interspecific hybrids. Recent growth rate of these individuals was determined by measuring the distance between scale circuli. In contrast to expectations, we found that native O. korogwe overall had a faster growth rate than the invasive O. niloticus, with hybrids showing growth rates more similar to O. korogwe. We propose that in Lake Rutamba the persistence of O. korogwe could be partially enabled by a faster growth rate than the large-bodied invasive O. niloticus. Based on these results, we suggest that predictions of the effects of invasive species on native biodiversity may benefit from information on relative fitness, in addition to ecological niche overlap.

Yet, despite the negative impact of urbanization on coastal environments, industrial structures can also provide artificial habitats. These are often easily accessible to regular surveys, including water sampling for environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis, an emerging and powerful tool for monitoring biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we utilized eDNA metabarcoding to investigate temporal and spatial trends in fish assemblages within urban coastal habitats between the Dee and Mersey estuaries (United Kingdom), historically one of the most anthropogenically impacted postindustrial coasts in the world. Over a 12-month period, we conducted nine water sampling trips at two locations: the Albert Docks in central Liverpool, and the Marine Lake in West Kirby. Illumina sequencing was used to analyze PCR amplicons generated using the fish-targeted Tele02-12S metabarcoding region. We found significant changes in fish community composition across the different months. Fish communities also significantly differed between the two sites, with the patterns of temporal changes varying substantially between them. Seasonal appearances/disappearances of specific taxa (e.g., European eel, sand smelt, flounder, and herring) shed light on important ecological and behavioral processes that may have management implications. Results also corroborate previous findings on the importance of "molecular bycatch" (nontarget sequences) in expanding our understanding of the anthropogenic influences on the natural environment. Overall, our findings emphasize the value of eDNA monitoring as a noninvasive, affordable, and sensitive approach for routine monitoring of temporal trends in fish assemblages, facilitating the stewardship of resilient urban coastal zones, and recognizing interventions that could increase biodiversity.

The impact of seasonal cattle grazing on ungulate spatiotemporal behavior in a multiuse recreational area in central Alberta	PLOS ONE												As grazing lands expand it is important to understand the effect cattle (Bos taurus) may have on native ungulates. Cattle presence in a landscape can cause both spatial and temporal partitioning in wild ungulates. We used remote cameras to investigate the impacts of seasonal rest-rotational cattle grazing on both the temporal and spatial behaviors of moose (Alces alces), elk (Cervus canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus hemonius), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Park near Edmonton, AB, Canada. We found that all wild ungulates decrease their intensity of use in areas while cattle were grazing, and that this effect remains even after cattle have left, suggesting a degree of spatial partitioning. We also observed species specific changes in ungulate daily activity and nocturnality in response to cattle presence indicative of temporal partitioning. Elk increased their nocturnality while both deer species decreased their nocturnality. Understanding how cattle presence affects wild ungulates is essential for wildlife management, disease transmission, and conservation in the wake of potential increased ungulate-cattle interactions in the future.

In today's rapidly evolving climate, utilizing advanced remote sensing techniques to quickly extract long-term lake ice phenology features and studying their correlation with other climate factors is crucial. This study focuses on lakes in Xinjiang, China, with a mountainous area greater than 100 km2, including Sayram Lake, Ayahkum Lake, Achihkul Lake, Jingyu Lake, and Ahsaykan Lake. The Bayesian ensemble change detection algorithm was employed to extract lake ice phenology information, and the Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric test was used to analyze trends. The visual interpretation method was used to interpret the spatial evolution characteristics of lake ice, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to explore the driving factors of lake ice phenology. Results indicate the following: (1) Jingyu Lake exhibited the most significant delay in both freezing and complete freezing days, while Ayahkum Lake showed the most stable pattern. Ahsaykan Lake demonstrated the least delay in both starting and complete melting days. (2) Sayram Lake's ice evolution was unstable, with wind causing variability in the locations where freezing begins and melting spreading from the west shore. Ayahkum Lake, Ahsaykan Lake, and Jingyu Lake exhibited similar seasonal variations, while Achihkul Lake's ice spatial changes spread from the east to the center during freezing and from the center to the shore during melting. (3) The study found that the freeze-thaw process is influenced by a combination of factors including lake area, precipitation, wind speed, and temperature.					; Rusuli, Yusufujiang/Q-8896-2016	ru su li, yu su fu jiang/0000-0002-4836-6517; 														2073-4441				NOV	2024	16	21							3059	10.3390/w16213059	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16213059													WOS:001351989000001

Full life cycle assessment of insect biomass allows estimation of bioflows across water, air, and land	ECOSPHERE												As global environmental change continues, animals face uncertain habitat availability and quality that influences life cycle phenology and population dynamics. For decades, the population abundance and emergence patterns of burrowing mayflies have been used as a sentinel for water quality changes in large freshwater systems around the world. Despite reduced point source pollutants, evidence is mounting that the interactions among habitat loss, contaminants, and changing climate could be causing declines in mayfly production and shifts in emergence timing. We combined radar observations with traditional field measures to identify changes in mayfly populations from nymph to adult. We studied Hexagenia sp. secondary production in a large reservoir, Lake Seminole, which has contrasting water sources and land use on each arm that could contribute to differences in emergence patterns. We predicted that mayfly secondary production would be higher, and emergence would be earlier in the Chattahoochee arm versus the Flint arm because of differences in available nutrients and temperature. Benthic declines in abundance and biomass followed radar observations of emergence. Mean annual water temperature was similar, with the Flint arm having less seasonal variation. Mayfly growth was similar across the lake, but production was higher in the upper Flint arm, perhaps because of temperature stability, higher nutrient concentrations, and more lotic conditions. The natural abundance of nitrogen-stable isotopes in mayflies showed distinct patterns between the arms and from nymph to adult. Linking benthic sampling with radar observations verified our capability to track mayfly biomass across the landscape and begin to calibrate previous measures of production with radar-derived abundance. Coupling radar observations with stable isotope and tissue nutrient measurements allowed us to further quantify the subsidies moving from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems, setting the framework to examine both historic and future population changes and mayfly contributions to cross-ecosystem subsidies.																			2150-8925					NOV	2024	15	11							e70025	10.1002/ecs2.70025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.70025													WOS:001368675700001

In recent years, glucocorticoids have been widely detected in surface waters such as rivers and lakes, but there are relatively few studies focusing on their ecological risk assessment. In this study, the pollution characteristics of seven glucocorticoids were studied in the Jiangsu section of the Yangtze River Basin, and ecological risk assessments were performed using the risk quotient method. The results showed that seven glucocorticoids were detected at different levels at eight sampling sites. Among these glucocorticoids, prednisone had the highest value of 238.27 ng/L in the wet season, with pollution levels significantly higher than those reported in other areas. The ecological risk evaluation showed that prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone acetate all had risk quotient values greater than 1 in the studied water environment, posing a high ecological risk. This study provides a scientific foundation for the in-depth study of the pollution characteristics and ecological risk of glucocorticoids in water bodies in the Jiangsu section of the Yangtze River Basin.					xu, keke/OMK-4944-2025														2095-2201	2095-221X				NOV	2024	18	11							143	10.1007/s11783-024-1903-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-024-1903-5													WOS:001312155900004

This study conducted warming (W) and thermal subsidence (RR) control experiments using an Open-Top Chamber (OTC) device in the river source wetlands of the Qinghai Lake basin. The aim was to assess the impacts of warming and thermal subsidence on soil temperature, volumetric water content, biomass, microbial diversity, and soil respiration (both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration). The results indicate that warming significantly increased soil temperature, especially during the colder seasons, and thermal subsidence treatment further exacerbated this effect. Soil volumetric water content significantly decreased under thermal subsidence, with the RRW treatment having the most pronounced impact on moisture. Additionally, a microbial diversity analysis revealed that warming promoted bacterial richness in the surface soil, while thermal subsidence suppressed fungal community diversity. Soil respiration rates exhibited a unimodal curve during the growing season. Warming treatment significantly reduced autotrophic respiration rates, while thermal subsidence inhibited heterotrophic respiration. Further analysis indicated that under thermal subsidence treatment, soil respiration was most sensitive to temperature changes, with a Q10 value reaching 7.39, reflecting a strong response to climate warming. In summary, this study provides new scientific evidence for understanding the response mechanisms of soil carbon cycling in Tibetan Plateau wetlands to climate warming.

The results revealed that the mean daily variation of CO2 flux during the growing season exhibited a U-shaped pattern, with measurements ranging from -12.42 to 4.28 mu molCO2<middle dot>m-2<middle dot>s-1. The Chenhu wetland ecosystem functions as a carbon sink throughout the growing season, subsequently transitioning to a carbon source during the non-growing season, as evidenced by observations made in 2022. The annual CO2 absorption was quantified at 21.20 molCO2<middle dot>m-2, a figure that is lower than those documented for specific subtropical lake wetlands, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. However, this measurement aligns closely with the average net ecosystem exchange (NEE) reported for wetlands across Asia. The correlation between daytime CO2 flux and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) can be accurately represented through rectangular hyperbola equations throughout the growing season. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) acts as a constraining factor for daytime NEE, with an optimal range established between 0.5 and 1.5 kPa. Furthermore, air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and vapor pressure difference (VPD) are recognized as the principal determinants affecting NEE during the nocturnal period. The association between Ta and NEE during the non-growing season conforms to the van't Hoff model, suggesting that NEE increases in response to elevated Ta during this timeframe.																				2073-4441				NOV	2024	16	22							3169	10.3390/w16223169	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16223169													WOS:001366444500001

Currently, there are two known cytotypes of flowering rush, diploid and triploid, within the invaded range. Although most studies have focused on the triploid cytotype, little information is known about diploid plants. Therefore, phenology and resource allocation were studied on the diploid cytotype of flowering rush in three study sites (Mentor Marsh, OH; Tonawanda Wildlife Management Area, NY; and Unity Island, NY) to understand seasonal resource allocation and environmental influences on growth, and to optimize management strategies. Samples were harvested once a month from May to November at each site from 2021 to 2023. Plant metrics were regressed to air temperature, water temperature, and water depth. Aboveground biomass peaked from July to September and comprised 50% to 70% of total biomass. Rhizome biomass peaked from September to November and comprised 40% to 50% of total biomass. Rhizome bulbil densities peaked from September to November at 3,000 to 16,000 rhizome bulbils m(-2). Regression analysis resulted in strong negative relationships between rhizome starch content and air temperature (r(2) = 0.52) and water temperature (r(2) = 46). Other significant, though weak, relationships were found, including a positive relationship between aboveground biomass and air temperature (r(2) = 0.17), a negative relationship between rhizome bulbil biomass and air temperature (r(2) = 0.18) and a positive relationship between leaf density and air temperature (r(2) = 0.17). Rhizomes and rhizome bulbils combined stored up to 60% of total starch, and therefore, present a unique challenge to management, as these structures cannot be reached directly with herbicides. Therefore, management should target the aboveground tissue before peak production (July) to reduce internal starch storage and aim to limit regrowth over several years.					; Harms, Nathan/AER-3500-2022	Wersal, Ryan/0000-0002-4014-5138; 													1939-7291	1939-747X				DEC	2024	17	4					247	257		10.1017/inp.2024.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2024.31		OCT 2024											WOS:001388961300001

It studies the natural decay process of five major hydrophytes in the lake and analyzes the impact of this process on water quality. The results show that the decay patterns of the five plants are similar, each being divided into three stages. In the initial stage, easily decomposable organic matter rapidly breaks down, releasing large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus into the overlying water, quickly consuming dissolved oxygen and significantly lowering the pH. In the middle stage, the decomposition rate of organic matter slows down, and the nitrogen and phosphorus content in the water gradually decreases while dissolved oxygen and pH slowly rise. In the final stage, the organic matter within the plants is completely consumed, leaving primarily lignin, and the concentrations of various substances in the water stabilize, reaching a steady state. Additionally, this study establishes a Monod-type kinetic model to simulate changes in ammonia nitrogen in water during the decay process. By adjusting the parameters K 1, K 2, and K 3, we obtained fitted curves consistent with the decay data trends for five plants. This helps to understand the impact of plant decay on water quality in Nansi Lake and provides a basis for plant disposal strategies and water quality management across different seasons in Nansi Lake.					; Ma, Jun/A-7253-2011; Zhang, Zhibin/V-1511-2017	Zhang, Wen/0000-0001-8413-0598; 														2690-0637				OCT 25	2024	4	11					4943	4957		10.1021/acsestwater.4c00551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00551		OCT 2024											WOS:001343795900001

However, there is a lack of research concerning the spatial correlation among different landscape micro-ecosystems within a catchment area, hindering a comprehensive understanding of watershed systematic evolution across various landscape micro-ecosystems. To address this gap, seasonal variations in bacterial community structure and ecological network connectivity were investigated across different geomorphological units in the eastern Ulansuhai Lake Basin, North China. Water and soil samples were collected in May (beginning of the growing season, 23 samples) and November (end of the growing season, 20 samples) 2021. The diversity of bacterial communities within the Multi Geomorphological Unit System (MGUS) comprising "mountain, forest, field, grassland, sand and water" increased from May to November due to precipitation and human cultivation influences. Environmental characteristics, such as water and soil variations, exert a greater influence on bacterial community structure than differences in landscape units. The stability of the macroecological network structure within the MGUS was relatively high, with "water" playing a pivotal role in connectivity (the average betweenness centrality value of "water" was more than twice that of the other landscape samples). This led to the gradual emergence of deterministic processes in the construction of the bacterial community, shifting from stochastic processes (90.8 % drift effect in May) to biotic interactions (29.2 % heterogeneous selection in November). Furthermore, the bacterial community structure exhibited "macroscopic stability, with 'water' assuming a central role, while also showing microscopic variations, reflecting fluctuations in the contribution of dominant bacterial genera to the network structure over time". Our study offers a core information analysis aimed at characterizing the temporal and spatial evolution of microbial community structure within an MGUS, thereby addressing a gap in microbial macroecology.

Paleo-records from the Caribbean Sea and the eastern equatorial and subtropical Pacific Ocean illustrate the response of regional precipitation to fluctuations in global temperature, driven by glacialinterglacial cyclicity over the past 500 kyr. Here, we present a paleoclimate and paleoenvironment record from Lake Pete<acute accent>n Itza<acute accent>, lowland Guatemala, which spans the last 413 kyr. Sediment in the lake recorded lacustrine and terrestrial ecosystem responses to large-scale climate variability. Precipitation patterns during MIS11-9 ( 413-304 ka BP) align with the latitudinal position of the ITCZ, with superimposed effects from the strength of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ). A sediment hiatus, likely attributable to mass removal processes in the lake's shallower areas, spans the period from MIS8 (starting at 304 ka BP) to the end of MIS6 (at 149 ka BP). MIS6 was characterized by humid conditions, perhaps ascribable to a more southerly extension of cold fronts and intensification of the CLLJ. During MIS5, pronounced fluctuations among all sediment variables, accompanied by an abrupt decline in precipitation, may correspond with cold events inferred from North Atlantic Ocean sediment cores. Although discontinuous, the Lake Pete<acute accent>n Itza<acute accent> sediment record provides a window into late Quaternary climate and environmental change in lowland Central America.

However, due to the accuracy limitations of altimetry data and mass conversion models, a significant uncertainty remains in estimating the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet, especially in East Antarctica. The ICESat-2 photon altimetry satellite enhances the precision of ice sheet surface elevation measurements to an accuracy of 2-4 cm. This improvement is particularly beneficial for detecting subtle elevation changes in East Antarctica. The ATL11 product from ICESat-2 offers a time series of ice surface elevations across Antarctica, enabling direct calculation of elevation change rates. To evaluate the capability of the ATL11 product in accurately depicting detailed elevation changes within the local terrain, we selected the Vostok Subglacial Lake as the validation region. Our research involves comparing fitted surface elevation change rates with in-situ data, while also considering surface mass balance, wind, and surface elevation to analyze the factors contributing to small differences in elevation changes within the local lake area. This analysis aims to identify the factors contributing to the minor variations in elevation changes within the local lake area. According to our analysis, the Vostok Lake surface elevation change rate is 2.00 +/- 0.77 cm yr-1 from April 2019 to June 2023, with an average period of 356 +/- 81 days. The results demonstrate that the ATL11 elevation product sequence has the potential to accurately characterize subtle elevation changes and seasonal variations in the Antarctic ice sheet.

In this study, chironomid pupal exuviae were used as surrogates to assess urban streams and a lake in Douala Cameroon. We compared these assessments with samples collected from a suburban forest stream. Based on their highly adaptive capability, we predicted that chironomid communities would present high diversity and abundance in urban habitats. Chironomid pupal exuviae were collected using the chironomid pupal exuvial technique in 14 urban and 2 forest reference stations during dry and rainy seasons. Measurements of the environmental variables were done simultaneously. Physicochemical analysis revealed that all urban sites have had very poor ecological health status whereas forest site had good water quality as shown by the hierarchical cluster analysis. This ecological survey identified 8 species/morphotypes of chironomids all belonging to the subfamily Chironominae, tribe Chironomini. These are Chironomus holomelas(?), Chironomus sp.1, Chironomus sp.2, Chironomus sp.3, Chironomus (Lobochironomus) sp., Stenochironomus sp., Dicrotendipes sp. and Dicrotendipes pulsus. No midge pupal exuviae were recorded at the forest stations (S1 & S2) and the stations S6 and S7 located downstream industrial mill effluents. The species richness of the study sites was significantly very low as compare to other Afrotropical studies. Canonical redundancy analysis revealed that high values of water temperature, ammonium, nitrates and phosphates, and low oxygen concentration were significant predictors of the distribution and high abundance of Chironomidae. This survey highlighted the impacts of anthropogenic activities on chironomid diversity and distribution, with great decrease of their diversity due to industrial pollution.

J	Yu, MW; Guo, YG; Li, F; Su, LB; Qin, DS				Yu, Mingwei; Guo, Yonggang; Li, Feng; Su, Libin; Qin, Deshun			Study of the patterns of ice lake variation and the factors influencing these changes in the western Nyingchi area	OPEN GEOSCIENCES												The current ice lake dataset in the western region of Nyingchi requires further improvement. Due to the intricate distribution of ice lakes and imprecise boundary delineation, research tends to overlook small-scale ice lakes in this area. Moreover, most related studies have focused solely on variations in ice lake areas within key regions, such as the Himalayas, with little attention given to changes occurring in southeastern Tibet. The frequency of ice and snow disasters in the study area has been steadily increasing over the years. Therefore, this study utilizes Landsat satellite images and employs visual interpretation methods to generate more precise and comprehensive maps depicting the distribution of ice lakes in the western region of Nyingchi Province for the years 1994, 2010, 2018, and 2022. Additionally, changes in scale and spatial patterns of different types of ice lakes were investigated. Between 1994 and 2022, the ice lake area in the study area significantly increased by 22.5%, reaching a total of 35.8 +/- 3.0 km2. This expansion was primarily driven by glacier-fed lakes, which experienced a remarkable growth rate of 30.8%. In contrast, the non-glacier-fed lakes experienced an increase by only 15.6%. Notably, ice lakes at higher elevations exhibited a peak in expansion, with those above 5143.0 m experiencing the most substantial growth rate of 44.8%. The long-term expansion rate of ice lakes is investigated through the measurement of changes in their boundaries, with the aim to understand the factors contributing to their growth. These findings indicate the rapid expansion of the ice lake near the glacier, with an annual growth rate of 1.3% per annum. Specifically, the glacial-fed section exhibited an expansion rate of 1.1% per annum, while the nonglacial-fed section experienced a growth rate of 0.6% per annum. The seasonal variability in marine glaciers is the primary factor influencing the expansion of ice lakes in this region, with temperature and precipitation serving as the principal driving forces impacting the transformation of these lakes. The data provided by the research results will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms governing the ice lake in western Nyingchi, thereby contributing to an enhanced scientific comprehension of potential disaster risks associated with this ice lake.

Assessing the distribution and ecotoxicological risks of organochlorine pesticides in a river-wetland system of the Manipur River basin, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												The present study aims to evaluate the distribution of organochlorine pesticides in the Loktak Lake and its draining rivers over a spatial and seasonal scale. Organochlorine pesticides including alpha- HCH, beta- HCH, gamma- HCH, delta- HCH, Aldrin, 4,4-DDE, Endrin, Endosulfan II, 4,4-DDD, Endrin Aldehyde, Endosulfan sulphate and 4,4-DDT were analysed in the water and sediments adopting gas chromatography and mass spectrometric techniques. The concentration of pesticides recorded the highest concentration of 2271 ng/l in the water samples and 5319 ng/g in sediment samples. In water samples, Endosulfan II, Endrin and gamma- HCH were present at the higher concentrations, whereas alpha-BHC was recorded at the lowest at 0.78 ng/l. In sediment samples, 4, 4-DDT recorded the highest concentration, followed by 4,4-DDD and Endosulfan II. Human health risk assessment based on water consumption shows higher risk potential from five pesticides. Pesticides in the region may pose a threat to the wetland comprising vital flora and fauna of the biodiversity hotspot. The bacterial population was more or less related to the pesticide concentration, with a lower population at less contaminated sites.

J	Mohan, R; Thomas, LC; Padmakumar, KB				Mohan, Renju; Thomas, Lathika Cicily; Padmakumar, Kunnatholickal Balakrishnan			Assessment of hydrographic parameters and trophic status of selected freshwater ecosystems of southwest India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Natural freshwater ecosystems, especially ponds, are highly vulnerable to increasing anthropogenic activities and natural alterations owing to their small size and volume. Variations in species diversity, continuous occurrence of harmful algal blooms and changes in aquatic ecosystems are some consequences of the resulting hydrological variations. The trophic state index is one of the easiest and most widely used methods for understanding the trophic status of such disturbed aquatic ecosystems. The present study analysed the variations in different hydrographic parameters with an emphasis on major nutrient status to understand the water quality of two freshwater ponds (S1 and S2) using Carlson's trophic state index (TSI). Assessing the water quality for two years, algal biomass, as indicated by chlorophyll a was maximum during pre-monsoon seasons (S1: 82.08 mg m-3 and S2: 204.97 mg m-3). Dissolved nutrients like nitrate, phosphate and silicate varied from 0.35 mg L-1 to 6 mg L-1, 0.119 mg L-1 to 0.67 mg L-1 and 2.44 mg L-1 to 14.39 mg L-1, respectively, during the study. The TSI result indicated the eutrophic to the hypereutrophic condition in the study area (TSI 71.9 to 82.4). The TSI values reached a maximum at S1 during monsoon 2019, while at S2, the peak value was observed during pre-monsoon 2021. The continuous occurrence of harmful cyanobacterial blooms dominated by Microcystis sp. observed from both freshwater ponds indicated the polluted and deteriorating condition of the ponds. The present study evaluated the seasonal variations in hydrographic parameters and trophic status of two selected freshwater ecosystems of southwest India, highlighting their eutrophic to hypereutrophic state. Understanding the trophic status of freshwater ecosystems provides valuable insights into the necessity of mitigation and management practices to safeguard the aquatic ecosystem from deterioration caused by nutrient loading leading to harmful algal blooms.					; KB, Padmakumar/AAJ-1065-2021	KB, Padmakumar/0000-0002-3991-4462; Mohan, Renju/0000-0002-2532-7638; Cicily Thomas, Lathika/0000-0002-6753-6446														2823-1465				OCT 4	2024	60								18	10.1051/limn/2024021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2024021													WOS:001328740700001

Traditional radioecological models use radionuclide concentrations in water to predict concentrations in aquatic organisms. In this study, we investigated the distribution of radioecologically important metals (Ba, Co, Ni, Sr, U) among sediment, porewater and hypolimnion over seasons. We also studied the uptake of these metals to benthic organisms and importance of sediment as an uptake source by conducting a 28-day in situ bioaccumulation experiment with oligochaete worms ( Lumbriculus variegatus). ). The studied metals were chosen based on common occurrence of their radioactive isotopes in nuclear fuel cycle. Measurements of total elemental concentration were used as proxies to study the behavior of specific radionuclides. Sediment and water samples were collected from two small lakes connected to a former uranium mine in Eastern Finland, and from a nearby reference lake connected to a different drainage area. Environmental characteristics and concentrations measured from sediment, porewater and overlying water indicated only minor changes between seasons. Measured metals were highly associated with sediment particles, rather than pore- water or hypolimnion. Both the distribution of metals and in situ experiment indicated the importance of sediment as the main source of bioaccumulation. Significant differences in Ba, Ni and U concentrations between treatments containing contaminated sediment and reference sediment were noted, regardless of water concentrations. Additionally, as U contaminated lakes lacked seasonal overturn during our monitoring period, metal distribution and environmental conditions remained unchanged in deeper parts of those lakes.

This study investigates the hydrological dynamics of the Shire River by examining its flow components and the influence of baseflow under varying climatic conditions. Through meticulous baseflow separation using the Eckhardt recursive digital filter and recession analysis, Lake Malawi emerges as the primary contributor to the river's baseflow, sustaining approximately 80%- 82% of total flows annually of which about 78% is contributed during wet seasons. Moreover, an inverse relationship between baseflow and rainfall is observed, highlighting the significance of baseflow augmentation during drier periods. Baseflow analysis of wettest and driest years further elucidates precipitation's impact on baseflow fluctuations, emphasizing the intricate interplay between precipitation patterns and baseflow dynamics. Therefore, to ensure the sustainable management of the Shire River, it is crucial to implement policies that support the conservation of groundwater resources and the efficient allocation of water during varying climatic conditions. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the hydrological processes of the Shire River, contributing to enhanced understanding and sustainable management of this essential water resource.					; Kumambala, Patsani/LLM-0467-2024	KUMAMBALA, PATSANI/0000-0003-3947-6295; 													1474-7065	1873-5193				DEC	2024	136								103758	10.1016/j.pce.2024.103758	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pce.2024.103758		OCT 2024											WOS:001332748400001

Samplings were performed seasonally between January 2016 and October 2018 at five stations. Zooplankton communities comprised Rotifera (88%), Cladocera (3%) and Copepoda (9%). A total of 73 species were recorded. Four species Asplanchna priodonta, Polyarthra dolichoptera, Synchaeta pectinata and Bosmina longirostris were found dominant among the others. During the study, the number of zooplankton species decreased in 2018 compared to 2016 when the average zooplankton density increased in 2018. The variations of zooplankton community were estimated using Shannon-Wiener diversity, Evenness, and Simpson indices. The correlations between the species and environmental variables were analyzed with Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The variation in the species data was significantly (p < 0.05) related to a set of six environmental variables (electrical conductivity, chloride, ammonium, carbon, depth, temperature) which explains 84.6% of the total variation. CCA indicated that Keratella cochlearis, Lecane bulla, L. clostrocerca, Trichocerca similis and Copepoda spp. were positively correlated with temperature. According to the Brachionus: Trichocerca quotient (QB/T), Lake E & gbreve;irdir can be characterized within the mesotrophic-eutrophic trophic status.

J	Gholizadeh, F; Zeynolabedin, A; Behboudian, M				Gholizadeh, Fatemeh; Zeynolabedin, Amin; Behboudian, Massoud			An uncertainty-based evaluation of sulphuric compounds transport in reservoirs considering sensitivity analysis	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Deepwater bodies such as dam reservoirs are among the most prominent water resources that supply societies' water demand. Hence, water quality in these resources requires continuous and meticulous monitoring. This study evaluated the water quality of Changuleh Dam, a dam under construction in western Iran, using the CE-QUAL-W2 model to predict fluctuations in sulphate (SO42-) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) concentrations. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the dependence of model outputs on input variables. Additionally, an uncertainty analysis was performed using MATLAB to address the inherent uncertainties of the input variables through an ARIMA (2, 2, 1) time series model and Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicated a high sulphate concentration averaging 955.6 mg/l, considerably exceeding the drinking water standard of 400 mg/l, identifying the reservoir as a sulphate-rich water resource. Seasonal fluctuations of H2S concentrations were also observed in the reservoir's anaerobic bed sediments, peaking at 87 mg/l. The sensitivity analysis showed that nitrate and total dissolved solids (TDS) varied more noticeably than dissolved oxygen (DO) at different depths, with the greatest variation at 50 m. This study highlights the critical need for continuous and meticulous monitoring of water quality in dam reservoirs to meet water supply standards. Sulfate concentrations in the reservoir exceeded drinking water standards, averaging 955.6 mg/l. Hydrogen sulfide concentrations peaked at 87 mg/l during seasonal stratification. Sensitivity analysis revealed that nitrate and TDS were more impacted by input variations than dissolved oxygen.

A Comparative Study of Cave System Calcium Isotope Ratios: Implications for Quantitative Reconstruction of Paleorainfall From Speleothems	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Variations in speleothem calcium isotope ratios (delta 44Ca) are thought to be uniquely controlled by prior carbonate precipitation (PCP) above a drip site and, when calibrated with modern data, show promise as a semi-quantitative proxy for paleorainfall. However, few monitoring studies have focused on delta 44Ca in modern cave systems. We present a multi-year comparative study of delta 44Ca, carbon isotopes (delta 13C), and trace elemental ratios from cave drip waters, modern calcite, and host rocks from two cave systems in California-White Moon Cave (WMC) and Lake Shasta Caverns (LSC). Drip water and calcite delta 44Ca from both caves indicate PCP-driven enrichment, and we used a simple Rayleigh fractionation model to quantify PCP variability over the monitoring period. Modern calcite trace element and delta 44Ca data positively correlate at WMC, but not at LSC, indicating a shared PCP control on these proxies at WMC but not at LSC. At both WMC and LSC, we observe an inverse relationship between PCP and rainfall amounts, though this relationship is variable across individual drip sites. Our modeled data suggest that WMC experiences similar to 20% more PCP than LSC, consistent with the fact that WMC receives less annual rainfall. This work supports speleothem delta 44Ca as an independent constraint on PCP that can aid in the interpretation of other hydrologically sensitive proxies and provide quantitative estimates of paleorainfall. Additional, long-term monitoring studies from a variety of climate settings will be key for understanding delta 44Ca variability in cave systems more fully and better constraining the relationship between PCP and rainfall. Chemical analyses on the minerals that make up stalagmites can provide useful information about how rainfall varied in the past, but most of the chemical parameters measured in stalagmites can respond to several complex environmental influences in addition to rainfall amount. Stalagmite calcium (Ca) isotope ratios can provide more direct information about past rainfall variability but haven't been closely studied in modern cave systems. In this study, we present new Ca isotope measurements of cave drip waters and modern calcite mineral samples collected at a seasonal-to-annual resolution from two sites in California that experience different amounts of yearly rainfall. We find that periods of less rainfall at each individual cave generally correspond to higher Ca isotope ratios and that the drier of the two caves experienced less water infiltration overall during the study period. These findings support the idea that Ca isotope ratios in cave systems are controlled by the amount of water infiltrating the cave and can be used in combination with other data from stalagmites to reconstruct rainfall variability in the past. This type of information about past rainfall patterns can help planners assess future water availability, which is especially important in drought-prone regions such as California. Drier periods correspond to higher Ca isotope ratios and more prior calcite precipitation, though there is variability between drip sites Modern calcite trace element ratios positively correlate with Ca isotope data at one of the two cave sites Ca isotope data provides an independent constraint on water infiltration to aid the interpretation of other hydrologically sensitive proxies					; Griffith, Elizabeth/KBB-3072-2024; Erhardt, Andrea/LIH-0008-2024	Oster, Jessica/0000-0002-1780-2435; de Wet, Cameron/0000-0002-9689-5886; Erhardt, Andrea/0000-0002-5213-986X; Griffith, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7919-4551														1525-2027				OCT	2024	25	10							e2024GC011691	10.1029/2024GC011691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GC011691													WOS:001338316800001

Mate choice and hybridization in the Western Grebe and Clark's Grebe: tests of the scarcity of mates and sexual selection hypotheses	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Hybridization is predicted to occur most frequently in closely related species when one species is rare (scarcity of mates hypothesis) and when the rare species of a heterospecific pair is more likely to be female (sexual selection hypothesis). We studied hybridization in mixed breeding colonies of the Western Grebe ( Aechmophorus occidentalis) and Clark's Grebe (A. clarkii) at Clear Lake, California, during 2011-2019. Of 203 mated pairs with at least one Clark's Grebe (the rarer species, attending 15% of nests), 77.3% were conspecific pairs, 20.7% were heterospecific pairs, and 2.0% comprised a Clark's Grebe paired with a presumed hybrid. The proportion of heterospecific pairs was no greater in smaller colonies or later during the breeding season, contradicting the scarcity of mates hypothesis. Of 42 heterospecific pairs, the Clark's Grebe was just as likely to be male (45.2%) as female (54.8%), contradicting the sexual selection hypothesis. Hybridization between these species more likely results from an error in sexual imprinting due to interspecific brood parasitism or from extra-pair copulations.																			1527-0904	1944-8341				OCT	2024	84	3					335	341																WOS:001368281600003

Currently, research on MP pollution in China has focused on urban and coastal areas. To better understand the extent of MP pollution in the surface water of rural areas, we investigated the abundance, particle size, color, shape, and polymer chemical characteristics of MPs in the Longjiang River in China during the wet season (August) and dry season (December). The results showed that MPs were detected at all 12 sampling sites in August and December, with higher mean abundances observed in August (112.60 +/- 5.63 items/m3) than in December (49.34 +/- 2.47 items/m3). The predominant particle sizes of the MPs ranged from 100-500 mu m, transparent was the most common appearance, and debris was the most common shape. Chemical characterization revealed that polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were the major polymer types. Correlation analysis indicated that agricultural film usage was the primary source of MP pollution in the Longjiang River basin. Risk assessments were conducted based on the chemical characteristics and abundances of MPs, revealing a high risk level due to the presence of hazardous PVC. However, the overall potential ecological level of MP pollution in the Longjiang River basin was lower than that observed in urban areas due to the lower abundances and pollution loads. This study provides valuable baseline data to assess the environmental risks associated with MPs and serves as a basis to formulate effective environmental policies.					赵, 学敏/ABC-5399-2021; Li, Siyang/LIG-7695-2024; Ma, Qianli/GSO-3147-2022														0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2024	235	10							619	10.1007/s11270-024-07422-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-024-07422-9													WOS:001293629100003

From Sugar Bush to Treaty Councils: Ozhaawashkodewekwe's Career in the Upper Great Lakes	ETHNOHISTORY												Anishinaabe women in the nineteenth-century upper Great Lakes inherited responsibilities through their doodem (clan), which included incorporating newcomers into their networks and caring for lands and waterways. Employing biography, this article focuses on Ozhaawashkodewekwe, a prominent Anishinaabe who attempted to transform the gender-specific resources of seasonal rounds into titled property at sugar camps and treaty councils. The various stages of Ozhaawashkodewekwe's life illustrate how biography involves navigating between the micro scale (details about her life) and the macro scale (Anishinaabe political practices and governance, as well as American settler-colonial political practices and governance). Collectively, her life showcases how Anishinaabe women's involvement in the fur trade exemplifies deliberate political engagement aimed at strengthening her family and communities in the face of AngloAmerican expansion.																			0014-1801	1527-5477				OCT	2024	71	4					471	496		10.1215/00141801-11266316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/00141801-11266316													WOS:001346926300003

Since the first half of the 20th century, the lake has undergone significant changes caused by human activity and anthropogenic pressure. To identify the current ecological state of two bays-Lchashen and Lichk-located in different parts of the lake, a study was conducted in 2022-2023 using a multi-biomarker approach. For this purpose, biomarkers for assessing the health status of fish and the quality of their living conditions were used such as the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the concentration of reduced glutathione (RGS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and gills of the whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus Linnaeus, 1758). In addition, hydrochemical and ichthyological analyses were conducted. This study demonstrated seasonal dynamics for all biomarkers. Comparative analysis of biomarkers and hydrochemical and ichthyological data showed that the whitefish in Lchashen Bay is in worse health, and its living conditions there are less favorable than in Lichk Bay.

Interrelationships Between NDVI, Surface Water, and Regional Hydro-Climatic Variables In the Sudd Wetland	WETLANDS												Climate change and its variability impact water availability in wetlands, jeopardizing their ecosystems. This study focuses on the Sudd Wetland, Africa's most extensive and one of the world's largest tropical wetland systems. We analyzed historical climate data (temperature, rainfall) in the Sudd and its upstream regions to assess climate impacts on the wetland's health (NDVI) and water conditions (surface water extent, lake height) using spatial and temporal trends. The study unveils distinct seasonal and long-term variations in vegetation and temporal fluctuations in surface water dynamics within the Sudd Wetland. While central areas experienced declining NDVI (vegetation cover), peripheries showed an increase. The wetland gained open water surface area, with a slight rise in permanent water (3%) and a significant increase in seasonal inundations (19%). All monitored water bodies in the Sudd displayed a gradual increase in surface water height. Climate shifts are observed as rising temperatures and increased rainfall trends. Annual and seasonal temperatures rose across the basin, with the January-Feburary season experiencing the most significant increase (similar to 1.3 degrees C). Rainfall trends were mostly flat, except for the south-central and southeastern regions, where a statistically significant increase ranging from 5 mm to 17 mm per year was observed. Conclusive evidence from this paper could be used to assess water policy and management in the region while protecting key parts of the hydrologic cycle.

Seasonal Dynamics of CH4 and CO2 Concentrations in Bog Lake Severnoe	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												Bog and lake ecosystems of the boreal region are recognized as important parts of the global biogeochemical carbon cycle. At the same time, many aspects of the gas regime dynamics of bog lakes remain understudied. The paper presents data on the seasonal dynamics of dissolved CH4 and CO2 concentrations in the bog lake located in the ridge-lake complex of the Ilassky bog, a typical raised bog in the northern taiga of northwestern Russia, and results of analysis of the seasonal vertical distribution of greenhouse gases in the water column and the dynamics of surface concentrations with increased time resolution. The reasons for and patterns of their variability are considered, including those in relation to the characteristics of the bottom sediments. Concentrations of CH4 and CO2 in the water column vary during the year within wide ranges: from 4 to 652 mu g/L and from 0.19 to 19 mg/L, respectively. CH4 concentrations in the surface layer are at approximately the same level from May through August, with values measured in the water (5.9 to 11 mu g/L) more than one hundred times higher than the concentrations in equilibrium with the atmosphere (0.04 to 0.05 mu g/L), indicating a methane flux to the atmosphere. The CO2 concentrations decrease throughout the open water period and become lower than the equilibrium concentrations with the atmosphere by the end of August, indicating a change in the flux direction and uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere. The results showed that, depending on the season, a bog lake can be not only a source but also a sink for atmospheric carbon, 90-99% of which is CO2 according to literature data.

Accurate identification of nitrogen pollution sources and the associated transformation processes is essential for protecting watershed ecosystems. In this study, a combination of hydrochemical analysis, correlation and principal component analysis, and stable nitrate isotopes (delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-) were employed to trace nitrogen transport pathways and source contributions in both surface water and groundwater within a typical agricultural watershed. The results revealed the presence of nitrogen pollution, including total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), with significant spatial and seasonal variations in both surface water and groundwater. The spatiotemporal evolution of hydrochemical indicators and nitrate isotope compositions highlighted multiple potential sources of nitrogen, including soil input, agricultural input, and manure and sewage input. The results from stable isotope analysis in an R (SIAR) model indicated that ammonium fertilizers (7.1 similar to 78.4%) and manure and sewage (2.6 similar to 69.7%) were the primary sources of nitrates in surface water, while manure and sewage were the main sources in groundwater (67.9 similar to 73.7%). This research demonstrated that nitrification, seasonal variations, and human activities significantly impact nitrogen migration and transformation in agricultural watersheds. However, the issue of groundwater severely polluted by manure and sewage has received insufficient attention. To effectively control nitrogen pollution in agricultural watersheds, it is necessary to improve septic tanks and sewage networks, as well as implement scientific fertilization practices.

Among the 209 specimens, 174 (83.3%) displayed a range of dietary items in their stomachs. The species' feeding patterns were determined through numerical indexes (frequency of occurrence and volumetric contribution) and composite indexes (index of preponderance [IOP] and Geometric Index of Importance [GIIi]). Detritus emerged as the primary food source for C. carpio, followed by macrophytes, insects and zooplankton. A lesser amount of phytoplankton, nematodes and ostracods were also consumed. On the basis of the findings, C. carpio can be classified as a detri-omnivore, as it consumes benthic species like nematodes, ostracods and insect larvae. Seasonal fluctuations in food item consumption were noted (p < 0.05), with higher intake during the rainy season and reduced consumption in the dry season. There was a distinct ontogenetic shift in the relative importance of food items and showed significant variations in food preferences among size groups (p < 0.05). The contributions of animal-origin food categories (ostracods, zooplankton and insects) were important in the diet of the smaller size class, whereas food of plant origin (macrophytes) and detritus were more important in the diet of adults. Understanding the seasonal feeding patterns and ontogenetic dietary shifts of C. carpio in Lake Arekit provides crucial insights into their ecological role within the lake's ecosystem and highlights their adaptability to eutrophic conditions.

Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Biogenic Element Accumulation in Bottom Sediments in the Trout Farm Impact Zone (Lake Ladoga)	WATER RESOURCES												The assessment of the spatiotemporal dynamics of biogenic element accumulation in the bottom sediments of a trout farm located in the northern part of Lake Ladoga was conducted for the first time. Sediment cores were sampled during different hydrological seasons both near the fish cages and at a distance from them. Analyses of total nitrogen and labile phosphorus compounds in the sediments were conducted layer by layer. The dependence of biogenic element content on the organic matter content in the bottom sediments was analyzed. The results showed that the temporal dynamics of biogenic element accumulation in the bottom sediments in the area influenced by the trout farm were closely related to the seasonal feeding intensity of the fish cages. The increase in biogenic element content in the bottom sediments, resulting from the functioning of the fish farm, did not affect the control points. The seasonal formation of an anaerobic reducing environment in the surface layer of sediments may contribute to the increased influx of the studied elements from the bottom sediments into the water column.					; Guzeva, Alina/ABG-2528-2020; Zaripova, Ksenia/GWV-4575-2022	Zaripova, Ksenia/0009-0001-1160-4139; 													0097-8078	1608-344X				OCT	2024	51	5					836	843		10.1134/S0097807824701094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807824701094													WOS:001320396600012

However, climate change threatens the stability and availability of these water resources by increasing rainfall variability, extending drought periods, and intensifying extreme weather events. These challenges underscore the need for precise and continuous monitoring of water levels and surface areas to ensure sustainable management. Due to the scarcity of gauging stations, the objective of this study is to leverage cloud computing technologies along with altimetric and satellite data, for effective reservoir monitoring. Tools like the EO-Africa program's Innovation Lab and Google Earth Engine (GEE), along with advanced image processing software such as PyGEE-SWToolbox and AlTis, were used to process large datasets from the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 satellites. These satellites delivered extensive, high-resolution imagery and altimetric data, crucial for monitoring changes in the reservoirs. The processed data were validated with in-situ measurements, yielding a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 0.4 m and a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.90. The results highlighted water surface and level changes from 2016 to 2022, with downward trends and seasonal variations closely aligning with in-situ measurements. The study also revealed that the relationship between water levels and surface areas is influenced by both precipitation and the hydrological regimes of the Bandama and Sassandra rivers, demonstrating the complexity of water dynamics in these reservoirs. This research emphasizes the effectiveness of integrating spatial hydrology with cloud computing tools for fast and accurate monitoring of large reservoir. The use of these advanced technologies provides near real-time, reliable, and easily accessible data, offering a significant advantage for water resource management in C & ocirc;te d'Ivoire.

Characterisation and depositional pattern of the modern pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs in Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, India, and its implications for palaeoecology and palaeoherbivory analysis	PALYNOLOGY												This study documents the depositional pattern of modern pollen and fungal spores in relation to the different vegetation types and wildlife activities in Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, located in north-east India. The pollen data accurately matches the extant vegetation types and provides additional evidence on the representation and relative abundance of the major pollen taxa in the pollen assemblages. The forest habitat is characterised by the abundance of Bombax, Lagerstroemia, Barringtonia, and Albizia pollen in the pollen assemblage. The swamp habitat is characterised by Cyperaceae, Onagraceae, Nymphaea, and Potamogeton, while the grassland habitat is characterised by the dominance of non-cereal (Poaceae), Asteroideae, Cyperaceae, and Bombax pollen. Also, coprophilous fungal spores were observed and identified. Their presence varies in relation to the different vegetation types and level of wildlife activity in each habitat in the wildlife sanctuary. Rhododendron pollen in the palynoassemblages is indicative of seasonal flooding during periods of high rainfall in and around the study areas. Principal component analysis applied to the quantitative data obtained from the pollen frequency analyses revealed a significant variation that distinguished the three different vegetation types in the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary. This modern pollen and fungal spore data serves as a reliable baseline for the reconstruction of the palaeoecology and palaeoherbivory in the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and to correlate the types of vegetation present in other parts of the tropical region of Indo-Burma.																			0191-6122	1558-9188				APR 3	2025	49	2								10.1080/01916122.2024.2404423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01916122.2024.2404423		SEP 2024											WOS:001330359800001

Groundwater development here has reached criticality and is contaminated with fluoride and uranium. As there are only a few small seasonal streams in the area, roof-water harvesting and utilization of tank/lake water are tested as alternative approaches for drinking water supply. The study area is in the Chikkaballapura district of eastern Karnataka, India, where the average annual rainfall is 700 mm. The quantity of roof water that can be harvested from the built structures in the study area can adequately meet the drinking water requirements, although not the entire domestic water needs. A nearly perennial lake located in the upper reaches of the micro-watershed stores 301 million litres of water that needs only routine filtration and chlorination. This study shows that sustainable water management practices such as roofwater harvesting and lake water utilization can replace the contaminated groundwater for drinking purposes.

All stratified regions which exhibited a pre-Dreissena BNL, including central Lake Erie, experienced substantial post-Dreissena reductions in near-bottom TP, although the forms of phosphorus (particulate or soluble) responsible for these reductions have varied from lake to lake. Notably, the arrival of Dreissena at offshore sites was not accompanied by an increase in soluble phosphorus. Initiation of changes in the BNL almost invariably preceded appearance of Dreissena in the offshore, suggesting both that dreissenid impacts on the reductions in the BNL were largely remote, and by extension that the source of the BNL was also at least in part remote. Previous researchers' estimates of the importance of the benthic pool of phosphorus to offshore water column concentration suggest that the post-invasion reductions in bottom phosphorus during the stratified season could be contributing to the offshore oligotrophication of the lakes.

Lake Taihu is confronted with severe eutrophication and algal blooms. Field investigations were carried out in Lake Taihu and two inflow rivers for two years to identify the source of COM and explore the bioavailability of COM to algae. Compositions and sources of COM were analyzed through UV absorption coefficients and parallel factor analysis of three-dimensional excitation emission matrix spectra (3D EEMs-PARAFAC). Absorption coefficient a(350) of COM in rivers surpassed that in the lake, SUVA(254) exhibited noteworthy seasonal variations, and S-R indicated a stable autochthonous characteristic. Three components were identified by PARAFAC analysis: tryptophan-like (C1), humic-like (C2), and tyrosine-like (C3). Fluorescence indexes showed that C1 and C3 were mainly autochthonously produced and C2 was derived from allochthonous inputs. The bioassays were conducted to assess the bioavailability of COM to the dominant species, Microcystis aeruginosa. The results showed that colloids supplied rich carbon sources and trace metals, supporting the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa. The specific growth rate, Chl a content, and biological increment of Microcystis aeruginosa in 50 % colloid-added treatment exceeded those in 20 % and 75 % treatments. Simultaneously, the effective quantum yield (F-v/Fm) and the apparent photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETRmax) demonstrated that the photosynthetic activity of Microcystis aeruginosa was higher in 20 % treatment. These findings help in understanding the intricate mechanisms of COM in lake ecosystems, and provide the robust scientific foundation for water management and protection in Lake Taihu.

Methane-oxidizing bacterial community dynamics in sub-alpine forest soil	MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM												Microbial activities in sub-alpine forest soil influence global cycling of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Understanding the dynamics of methane-oxidizing bacterial communities, particularly the roles of potentially active versus total microbial populations, is necessary for reducing uncertainty in global methane budget estimates. However, our understanding of the factors influencing methane cycling in forest soils is limited by our lack of knowledge about the biology of the microbes involved and how these communities are shaped by their environment. Here, we compared the composition and potential activity of microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of total genomic DNA (gDNA) and potentially active complementary DNA (cDNA) from shallow soil in Red Butte Canyon (Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). We compared riparian and upland soils at two time points in the growing season and found distinct differences in both the community composition of the gDNA and cDNA libraries and the potential drivers of these community structures. Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) were detected in all samples, with cDNA libraries containing a higher average relative abundance and diversity of methanotrophs compared to gDNA libraries. Methane flux at the sample sites did not significantly correlate to the relative abundance (gDNA) or potential activity (cDNA) of methanotrophs. In the cDNA libraries, there were significant positive correlations between the abundance of Methylococcaceae family methanotrophs and several non-methanotrophic methylotrophs previously found to be associated with methane-oxidizing bacterial communities. These findings suggest a complex relationship between methane-cycling bacterial communities and methane flux and highlight the need for further in situ studies to understand the environmental and ecological influences of these microbial consortia.IMPORTANCEMethane-oxidizing bacteria are found in diverse soil and sediment environments and play an important role in mitigating flux of this potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. However, it is unclear how these bacteria and their associated communities are structured in the environment and how their activity ultimately influences methane flux. In this work, we examine the composition and structure of methane-oxidizing bacterial communities in sub-alpine forest soil and find soil- and time-specific differences between the stable and potentially active populations. We also find that the potentially active populations of certain methanotrophs and non-methanotrophs are positively correlated. This work provides a step toward refining our understanding of microbially mediated biogeochemical cycles.

K. (Adry)			Paleoredox and lithofacies assessments in Deepwater intervals of the Monterey Formation, Santa Maria Basin, California: Insights from organic sulfur geochemistry	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												Although the Monterey Formation has been studied extensively for its petroleum system and Miocene climate insights, debates persist regarding its paleo-redox conditions. Furthermore, its characteristic lithofacies offer a natural laboratory for developing tools to differentiate siliceous and calcareous rocks in deepwater environments. This study evaluated the potential of the Sulfur Index (SI = mg S-org/g TOC), measured by Rock-Eval 7S, as a proxy for assessing paleoredox conditions by comparing the SI with iron speciation data. Additionally, highresolution molecular analyses were performed to investigate possible relationships between sulfur compounds and rocks with different carbonate content. The findings indicate higher SI values and higher concentrations of benzothiophenes over dibenzothiophenes in the siliceous lithofacies compared to the calcareous lithofacies. This suggests that the mineral matrix plays a crucial role in influencing the process by which sulfur-rich kerogen undergoes cracking when placed under thermal stress. The SI may support a paleoredox interpretation for the Monterey Formation, differing from previous interpretations based only on iron speciation. This alternative interpretation involves a more extensive water-column euxinia, distinct from the seasonal euxinia suggested in previous work. This study represents a practical and pioneering workflow based on sulfur data derived from Rock-Eval 7S for paleoredox and lithofacies assessments, opening avenues for further research.

The wreckages of Phoenix II (1820-1837), Burlington (1837-1853), Whitehall (1838-1852), and A. Williams (1870-1893) were carefully recorded and analyzed, allowing their identities to be verified and revealing extensive differences in construction choices of boats built for the same waterway within a very short time span. The results demonstrate the experimental nature of shipwrights who sought to build the fastest vessels to outpace the competition as passengers demanded more and more speed. By moving from sturdier structures in the 1820s to longer, narrower, and lighter forms in the 1830s and later, shipwrights capitalized on the hulls' designs to gain increments of speed for their employers.

J	Chao, CX; Chen, XR; Wang, J; Xie, YH				Chao, Chuanxin; Chen, Xiaorong; Wang, Jie; Xie, Yonghong			Response of submerged macrophytes of different growth forms to multiple sediment remediation measures for hardened sediment	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Climate change and intensified human activities have disrupted the natural hydrological regime and rhythm of river-connected lakes, extending the dry season, increasing water loss, and exposing previously submerged lake floors. This exposure has led to significant sediment hardening, which directly impacts submerged macrophytes. However, strategies to mitigate the negative effects of hardened sediments and promote the growth and development of submerged macrophytes remain largely unexplored. In this study, we selected typical hardened sediment from Dongting Lake to investigate the response of different growth forms of submerged macrophytes to multiple sediment remediation measures (loosening and litter addition) using a mesocosm experiment. The results indicated that loosening alone uniformly benefited all submerged macrophytes by increasing total biomass, relative growth rate (RGR), and the root/shoot ratio. Additionally, loosening altered the root traits of submerged macrophytes, promoting maximum root length (MRL) while reducing average root diameter (ARD). Moreover, different submerged macrophytes exhibited species-specific responses to the combination of loosening and litter addition. Notably, the combination of loosening and adding Miscanthus lutarioriparius litter had an antagonistic effect on the growth of Potamogeton wrightii and Myriophyllum spicatum. The response of functional traits of submerged macrophytes with similar growth forms to the same treatment was consistent. Our findings suggest that future sediment remediation efforts should consider matching specific treatments with the growth forms of submerged macrophytes to achieve optimal outcomes.																			1664-462X					SEP 3	2024	15								1450404	10.3389/fpls.2024.1450404	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2024.1450404								39290727					WOS:001313368200001

Calibrating acceleration transmitters to quantify the seasonal energetic costs of activity in lake trout	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Bioenergetics models are powerful tools used to address a range of questions in fish biology. However, these models are rarely informed by free-swimming activity data, introducing error. To quantify the costs of activity in free-swimming fish, calibrations produced from standardized laboratory trials can be applied to estimate energy expenditure from sensor data for specific tags and species. Using swim tunnel respirometry, we calibrated acceleration sensor-equipped transmitting tags to estimate the aerobic metabolic rates ((M) over dotO(2)) of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) at three environmentally relevant temperatures. Aerobic and swim performance were also assessed. Like other calibrations, we found strong relationships between (M) over dotO(2) and acceleration or swimming speed, and jackknife validations and data simulations suggest that our models accurately predict metabolic costs of activity in adult lake trout (similar to 5% algebraic error and similar to 20% absolute error). Aerobic and swim performance metrics were similar to those reported in other studies, but their critical swimming speed was lower than expected. Additionally, lake trout exhibited a wide aerobic scope, suggesting that the avoidance of waters >= 15 degrees C may be related to selection for optimal growing temperatures. The ability to quantify the free-swimming energetic costs of activity will advance our understanding of lake trout ecology and may yield improvements to bioenergetics model.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Bzonek, Paul/CAJ-0335-2022	Reeve, Connor/0000-0002-0238-0575; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 														1095-8649				DEC	2024	105	6					1769	1783		10.1111/jfb.15916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15916		SEP 2024						39228148					WOS:001304500500001

Between 2001 and 2018, nearly 74% of disasters were water-related, including floods and cyclones. Such water-related cataclysmic events increase the risk of drowning. We aimed to map evidence on the impact of climate change on water-related physical events, associated human migration, and drowning burden in India.Materials and Methods:We searched electronic databases, government reports, and relevant websites to map evidence on water-related physical events (including but not limited to sea-level rise, glacier bursts, lake bursts, floods, rainfall, cyclones, and droughts) and consequent human migration using narrative review approach, while drowning burden through scoping review approach. We summarized the results narratively.Results:Evidence from 48 studies and seven reports suggest that India will witness the greatest sea-level rise, significantly impacting poor coastal communities. An increase in droughts, cyclonic rainfall, storms, and floods, with increasing surface rainwater and streamflow water, due to melting glaciers is expected. Climate change-triggered migration is expected notably in northeast and south India, making farmers, drivers, street vendors, women, and youth most vulnerable. No direct evidence was identified on the impact of climate change, water-related disasters, meteorological events, or seasonal variations on drowning from India.Conclusion:Our study highlights a significant gap in the availability of context-specific and localized data to improve disaster response and strengthen public health systems, especially for areas most vulnerable to climate change. There is an urgent need to generate new knowledge and understanding of climate change, water-related or meteorological events, and seasonal variations' impact on drowning burden as the level of risk remains unknown.

Regulating the Level of Lake Baikal: Research Results	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												This paper presents the main results of comprehensive systems research into the issues of regulating the level of Lake Baikal. The research was conducted in 2021-2023 as part of State Task FWEW-2021-0009 On the Influence of Changes in the Lake Baikal Water Level on the Lake's Ecosystem and Assessment of the Damage to Economic Facilities and Infrastructure of the Coastal Territory of the Republic of Buryatia and Irkutsk Oblast, in the Context of the Lake's Level and Discharges of the Irkutsk HPP (final third stage of FWEW-2021-0009). The research involves analyzing the historical background for the emergence and evolution of the issue of regulating Lake Baikal, considering the need to take into account environmental and socioeconomic factors, and shedding the light on the reasons and relevance of this research. Critical intra-annual periods and components of the ecosystem are identified for the coastal part of the lake whose successful functioning largely depends on seasonal changes in the lake level. Environmental and fishery requirements are formulated for regulating the level of Lake Baikal. Socioeconomic damage is assessed for various lake levels and flow rates of the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Plant (HPP). Critical levels and flow rates are identified. Projected changes in the components of the water balance and net inflow into Baikal are presented considering the expected climate changes for the period up to 2060. A procedure (rules) for regulating the level of the lake is proposed with due regard for the environmental and socioeconomic factors for various streamflow water conditions. The permissible maximum and minimum levels, ranges for the lake level fluctuations, and flow rates of the Irkutsk HPP, which could minimize potential environmental and socioeconomic damage, are determined. Proposals are formulated to amend federal legislation related to the issues of regulating the level of Lake level.																			1875-3728	1875-371X				SEP	2024	45	3					221	228		10.1134/S187537282470029X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S187537282470029X													WOS:001400108400012

Increased levels of several elements (As, Bi, Cs, Co, Cu, Zn), bioaccumulated in fish muscle, were occasionally found in front of the former factory, but the obtained metal/metalloid concentrations in muscle were in general either comparable or even lower than in the fish from moderately contaminated freshwaters. Calculated target hazard quotients indicated that the current risk for humans, arising from consumption of the northern pike meat originating from a historically contaminated section of the Mre & zcaron;nica River, was negligible. The influence of biological factors, especially seasonal physiological changes, on metal/metalloid bioaccumulation was confirmed, indicating the importance of the involvement of these parameters in the freshwater pollution assessment, but also in the estimation of the human health hazard. The increased bioaccumulation of several metals/metalloids in fish muscle at a historically contaminated site pointed to the need for continuous supervision of fish health and biodiversity in freshwaters impacted by currently suspended long-term contamination sources.

Understanding the characteristics of water quality and the relationships between landscape patterns and water quality is crucial to informing land-use planning aimed at ensuring water security. In this study, we employed landscape index methods, correlation analysis, and redundancy analysis based on monitored water quality data and land-use types relative to the Yanshan River Basin, Guilin, China. The results show the following features: (1) Water quality in the small watershed exceeded the values of class III during the study period, and total nitrogen (TN) was the main pollutant, with a pollution load ratio reaching 67.9%. (2) Water quality was significantly impacted by the landscape patterns of the small watershed river. The monitored concentrations of TN, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and total phosphorus (TP) were negatively correlated with the proportion of forest area, and the concentrations of NH4+-N and TP were positively correlated with the proportions of building, orchard, and cultivated land areas. Moreover, the influences of landscape patterns during the wet seasons on water quality were stronger than those during the dry seasons. (3) The total interpretation rates of the landscape indices for the water quality indices in the dry and wet seasons were 96.7% and 94.4%, respectively. Moreover, the largest patch and aggregation indices of the building area were the most effective variables in explaining the water quality indices, with contribution rates of 30.8% and 23.2% in the dry seasons and 34.3% and 23.8% in the wet seasons, respectively. By analyzing these relationships, in this study, we obtained insights into how different landscape patterns contribute to variations in water quality. The findings contribute to sustainable land-use planning strategies that aim to mitigate the impacts of land-use changes on water resources.					; Huang, Jianhua/AAI-4242-2021	Xu, Baoli/0000-0001-8745-9196; 														2073-4441				SEP	2024	16	17							2472	10.3390/w16172472	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16172472													WOS:001311759000001

State parks are natural areas highly influenced by seasonal tourist activities. This study investigated the distribution and characterization of MPs, including abundance, size, shape, and color, in seven Virginia State Parks within the James River Watershed (Douthat, Natural Bridge, Holliday Lake, James River, Powhatan, Pocahontas, and Chippokes Plantation State Parks). The MP concentration among the seven locations in the watershed had a significant difference (p < 0.05) and ranged from 0-26.5 particles/L with a mean of 8.33 +/- 1.39 particles/L. The mountain region water bodies (Douthat and Natural Bridge) had the lowest MP concentration (< 4 particles/L), while the mainstream water bodies had a significantly higher MP concentration than other water bodies (10-20 particles/L) (p < 0.01). The size, shape, and color of MPs were also significantly different among all locations (p < 0.05). Faded and aged fragments with sizes below 1 mm were the most abundant, suggesting that terrestrial MPs were the most influencing source at most of the State Parks, and weathering effects have played a significant role in the fragmentation of plastics. In addition, a significantly positive relationship between MP concentration and the fraction of overnight guests was found (p < 0.0001). Our study indicated that State Parks and protected areas are polluted by MPs, which may pose potential harm to the surrounding environment, including both wildlife and humans.

Variations in temperature, precipitation, and runoff at four different timescales in the Fuhe River Basin were evaluated based on observational data collected from 1960 to 2020 using the Mann-Kendall test. The findings indicated significant increases in average temperatures for the annual, flood season, and non-flood season periods, rising by 0.0197, 0.0145, and 0.0278 degrees C every annum, respectively (p < 0.01). Precipitation exhibited non-significant upward trends at all timescales (p > 0.1). The trend in flood season runoff was also non-significantly upward, whereas annual runoff and non-flood season runoff displayed non-significant downward trends (p > 0.1). Flood season temperature decreased with increasing altitude, exhibiting a significant Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.744 at the 0.01 level. Conversely, annual, flood, and non-flood season precipitation significantly increased with increasing altitude, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.678 at the 0.01 level, 0.695 at the 0.01 level, and 0.558 at the 0.05 significance level, respectively. Precipitation and runoff exhibited similar trends throughout the year, increasing initially and then decreasing over time, reaching maximum values in June. Climate change is likely responsible for the hydrological alterations in the study basin. The findings of the study could provide references for water resource management decisions in the Fuhe River Basin.

Water and sediment samples were collected from Lake Chapala during three seasons, and MPs were quantified with a stereomicroscope. The structure, elemental composition, and polymeric composition were determined via environmental scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The highest average concentration of microplastics in Lake Chapala was detected during the low-water period in April 2022 (2.35 items/L), exceeding the July 2022 rainy season concentration (1.8 items/L) by 0.25 items/L, and sediment concentrations were also higher in April 2022 (219 items/kg) compared to July 2022 (210 items/kg). This study highlights the significant pollution of Lake Chapala with microplastics, emphasizing the need for urgent measures to manage plastic waste and mitigate its environmental impact on aquatic ecosystems.Practitioner Points Microplastic contamination was evaluated in Lake Chapala. The distribution profiles of microplastics were different in each area. Heavy metals osmium, tellurium, and rhodium were found associated with the PMs. Polymers were found in this study.

ZOOBENTHOS OF THE FREEZING WATER BODIES OF THE "MEDVEZH`I OSTROVA" NATURE RESERVE, EAST SIBERIAN SEA	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												While monitoring the Polar bear in the "Medvezh`i ostrova" (= Bears' Islands) Nature Reserve in October 2023, a number of mainland water bodies were surveyed: the lakes "Nesolyonoe" and "Unnamed", the Krestovaya River, the "Unnamed" watercourse on Chetiryokhstolbovyi Island, as well as the sea bay of Kolyma Bay, all in the East Siberian Sea. Representatives of zoobenthos were found in each of the water bodies studied, but the fauna was not very diverse. A total of only 7 species of benthic invertebrates were revealed in the surveyed water bodies of the Bears' Islands Nature Reserve, of which 3 species were found in sea water: Pacifoculodes pallidus (G.O. Sars 1892) (Amphipoda), Yoldiella nana (M. Sars 1865) (Bivalvia), and Enchytraeus albidus Henle 1838 (Oligochaeta). In the water bodies feeding the Galgavaam River, 2 species from the family Chironomidae and 3 species of eurytopic Oligochaeta were recorded. Their abundance ranges from 0.20 to 1.70 thousand ind./m(2) and 0.10 to 3.70 g/m(2) biomass in freshwater bodies, vs not exceeding 0.60 thousand ind./m(2) and 1.90 g/m(2) biomass in the sea. Seasonal cohorts are formed there, 37% of which are merohydrobionts (& Scy;hironomidae) and amphibiotic & Ocy;ligochaeta, and 13% each are neritic amphipods and bivalves. The formation of seasonal cohorts is determined by a short growing season and an extended ice formation on island and mainland watercourses and reservoirs.					; Potyutko, Oleg/AAA-3992-2019; Shelokhovskaya, Larisa/KPA-9647-2024	Shelokhovskaya, Larisa/0009-0007-9150-7286; 													0044-5134					SEP	2024	103	9					26	32		10.31857/S0044513424090032	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S0044513424090032													WOS:001376701600001

A Proxy System Modeling Approach to Combining Tree-Ring and Sediment-Based Paleotempestological Records	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												The short and biased observational record of tropical cyclones (TCs) limits scientific understanding of how these destructive storms respond to climate forcing. Paleohurricane records use natural archives (tree rings, coarse-grained sediment) to reconstruct TC properties (frequency and intensity of rainfall, wind) over the past few hundreds to thousands of years. However, different sensitivities and sampling biases in the various paleohurricane proxies restrict our ability to compile these records into regional or basin-scale TC estimates. Here we test how well pseudo tree-ring records of paleohurricanes capture TC rainfall and occurrence. Using a large set of statistically downscaled storms forced with the Max Planck Institute (MPI-ESM-P) model as boundary conditions for the past millennium, we generate a 1000-member ensemble of pseudo tree-ring records of latewood width from southern Mississippi using a Poisson process-based random draw. Pseudo records convert synthetic TC rainfall into latewood width using a previously published statistical calibration and seasonal sensitivity. We show that fourth quantile thresholds applied to pseudo latewood data successfully identify years with TC strikes. Comparing pseudo tree-ring records with pseudo sediment records from the Gulf Coast indicates promise in combining proxies sensitive to TC rainfall with proxies sensitive to storm overwash. Sediment records that are sensitive to lower intensity storms (>= Saffir Simpson Category 1) are more compatible with tree-ring records, suggesting a need for more of these low intensity threshold records in the Gulf to facilitate future multi-proxy efforts to reconstruct past TC properties.					; Emanuel, Kerry/JPL-6089-2023; Bregy, Joshua/OCK-9278-2025	Bregy, Joshua/0000-0002-3483-595X; Wallace, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6492-2077; Dee, Sylvia/0000-0002-2140-785X; 													2572-4517	2572-4525				SEP	2024	39	9							e2024PA004870	10.1029/2024PA004870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024PA004870													WOS:001314236400001

In this study, we systematically monitored the CH4 fluxes of nine cascade reservoirs (Dahejia, Jishixia, Huangfeng, Suzhi, Kangyang, Zhiganglaka, Lijiaxia, Nina, and Longyangxia) in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in the dry (May 2023) and wet seasons (August 2023) using the static chamber gas chromatography and headspace equilibrium methods. We also simultaneously measured environmental physicochemical properties as well as the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs in sediments. The results showed the following: (1) All reservoirs were sources of CH4 emissions, with an average diffusion flux of 0.08 +/- 0.05 mg m(-2) h(-1) and ebullition flux of 0.38 +/- 0.41 mg m(-2) h(-1). Ebullition flux accounted for 78.01 +/- 7.85% of total flux. (2) Spatially, both CH4 diffusion and ebullition fluxes increased from upstream to downstream. Temporally, CH4 diffusion flux in the wet season (0.09 +/- 0.06 mg m(-2) h(-1)) was slightly higher than that in the dry season (0.08 +/- 0.04 mg m(-2) h(-1)), but CH4 ebullition flux in the dry season (0.38 +/- 0.48 mg m(-2) h(-1)) was higher than that in the wet season (0.32 +/- 0.2 mg m(-2) h(-1)). (3) qPCR showed that methanogens (mcrA gene) were more abundant in the wet season (5.43 +/- 3.94 x 10(5) copies g(-1)) than that in the dry season (3.74 +/- 1.34 x 10(5) copies g(-1)). Methanotrophs (pmoA gene) also showed a similar trend with more abundance found in the wet season (7 +/- 2.61 x 10(5) copies g(-1)) than in the dry season (1.47 +/- 0.92 x 10(5) copies g(-1). (4) Structural equation modeling revealed that the ratio of mcrA/pmoA genes, water N/P, and reservoir age were key factors affecting CH4 ebullition flux. Variation partitioning further indicated that the ratio of mcrA/pmoA genes was the main factor causing the spatial variation in CH4 ebullition flux, explaining 35.69% of its variation. This study not only reveals the characteristics and influencing factors of CH4 emissions from cascade reservoirs on the Qinghai Plateau but also provides a scientific basis for calculating fluxes and developing global CH4 reduction strategies for reservoirs.

The Potential Role of Phytoplankton Functional Groups Under Anthropogenic Stressed Wetlands: Characterizing The Environmental Sensitivity	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Anthropogenic and climatic changes are continuously altering the freshwater plankton, necessitating an evaluation of the complex structure of plankton communities to understand and mitigate these impacts. In this context, the present study focuses on evaluating the structure of plankton communities, specifically Phytoplankton Functional Groups (FGs) for assessing the environmental sensitivity of wetlands under changing scenario. These FGs are defined by shared adaptive features rather than taxonomic traits. Over the period from 2016 to 2018, two ecologically distinct wetlands were examined, analysing their phytoplankton FGs and their relationship with water quality parameters. Ecohydrological data revealed significant seasonal variations (p <= 0.05) in key parameters such as water depth, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total alkalinity, total hardness, NO3-N, and PO4-P. Notably, there were no significant differences observed among the sampling stations within each wetland. A total of 125 phytoplankton genera/species were classified into 23 FGs in the open wetland and 22 FGs in the closed wetland. Spatial and seasonal analyses of dominant FGs suggested both wetlands were experiencing pollution pressures. This study highlights the powerful role of phytoplankton functional groups (FGs) as bioindicators of wetland health, uncovering pollution pressures. In open wetlands, 15 phytoplankton FGs with 36 key taxa (Indicator Value >= 40%) emerged as critical indicators, while in closed wetlands, only 10 FGs with 17 taxa were identified. To assess eutrophication, the occurrence of these indicator species was evaluated using BVSTEP function analysis. The study recommends pollution reduction in catchment areas and restoration of riverine connectivity to enhance FG diversity. Phytoplankton FG methodologies are deemed effective for assessing the environmental sensitivity of wetlands significantly impacted by human activities. This research offers a scientific foundation for the evaluation and restoration of wetland ecosystems. Phytoplankton functional groups (FGs) serve as precise bioindicators of wetland environmental sensitivity and pollution pressures.Seasonal and spatial assessments of water quality reveal insights into wetland ecological health.The response of phytoplankton FGs to environmental factors effectively indicates water quality.Key plankton species were identified as indicators of wetland ecological sensitivity.

However, the daily and seasonal dynamics of open water bodies are not well understood. This study aims to (1) analyze the daily and seasonal dynamics of water bodies, (2) estimate changes in surface water area extent including trends and change points, and (3) assess the connection between surface water extent and seasonal rainfall variation. To achieve this, we used the Global WaterPack and ERA5-Land daily aggregated datasets. We employed time series decomposition, trends analysis, and temporal lag correlation in our analysis. The results showed strong seasonal patterns of natural lakes compared to reservoirs/dams. Between 2003 and 2022, Lake Chad averaged 2,475.64 km(-2). The Northern pool of Lake Chad exhibited significant fluctuations, remaining below 600 km(2) between 2005 and 2012, from 2016 to 2019), with less than 350 km(2) lasting only for a few days annually. The Southern pool averaged between 2,200 and 2,400 km(-2), except during drought years (2006-2007), specifically between the days of the year to approximately 66, and days 301-365/6. In Lake Fitri, the yearly maximum and minimum water extents were observed between days 1-59 and 305-365/6, and between days 60 and 304, respectively<bold>.</bold>					Fokeng, Reeves/AAF-8336-2021; Klein, Igor/KJL-2430-2024; Bachofer, Felix/AAH-1648-2020	Klein, Igor/0000-0003-0113-8637; Bachofer, Felix/0000-0001-6181-0187; Sogno, Patrick/0000-0001-7474-4035; Fokeng, Reeves Meli/0000-0002-6303-2128; Uereyen, Soner/0000-0003-3733-0049; 													1464-7141	1465-1734				SEP	2024	26	9					2325	2352		10.2166/hydro.2024.130	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2024.130		AUG 2024											WOS:001301026800001

Fractionation of Sediment-Bound Nitrogen: Bioavailability and Contamination Status of the Nutrient in Thrissur Kole Wetlands, Southwest India	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												Fractionation of sediment-bound nitrogen (N) in Thrissur Kole wetland was carried out to assess the mobility, bioavailability, and nutrient contamination status. Various N fractions were extracted using KCl equilibrium extraction method, and the concentration of each N fraction was analyzed by spectrophotometric method. Dominance of ammonia during all seasons was due to dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+ and direct inputs from agriculture fields. Enrichment of urea during post-monsoon (181.78 +/- 8.47 ppm) was attributed to fertilizer sources. NO3--N deficit at central zone of the study area (monsoon and post-monsoon) was due to the anoxia. Comparatively higher values of NO2--N during monsoon (0.07 +/- 0.02 ppm) was due to the land run-off, leaching of fertilizers from agriculture fields, and higher rate of denitrification. Elevated content of total N [1819.94 +/- 40.20 ppm (pre-monsoon); 3061.62 +/- 13.21 ppm (monsoon); 2763.44 +/- 9.65 ppm (post-monsoon)] reflected the inputs from in-situ production, agriculture, terrestrial run-off, waste disposal, and guano as well as carcass of birds. Average contribution of bioavailable N to total N was higher (36.16%) indicated the possibility for eutrophication risk during pre-monsoon. Agriculture dominated regions recorded severe contamination and eutrophication risk as indicated by organic pollution index, organic nitrogen index, and phosphorous pollution index.

Over two consecutive years (2017 and 2018), observations were conducted both during the wet and dry seasons using a scan sampling method. Results revealed that olive baboons consumed 34 plant species belonging to 20 families, with 28 species in the wet season and 12 in the dry season. A total of 922 feeding events were recorded in the wet season and 621 in the dry season, indicating significant seasonal variation. Fruits were the preferred food item, especially in the dry season, followed by animal matter, seeds, leaves, and subterranean food. Interestingly, baboons also consumed tree bark regardless of season. In addition, their consumption of fruits (in both seasons) and seeds (in the dry season) highlights their ecological role in seed dispersal and plant regeneration within the park. To sustain baboon (and all non-human primates) conservation efforts within the park, it's important to maintain a high diversity and abundance of native fruit trees throughout the year. This study highlights the importance of understanding how seasonal changes in vegetation affect olive baboon feeding behavior for effective park management and biodiversity conservation.

Permafrost degradation compels melting permafrost to become an important source of surface runoff, changes the storage of groundwater, and greatly influences the hydrological processes in permafrost regions. However, the evidence linking permafrost degradation and hydrological processes on the QTP is lacking, which increases the uncertainties in the evaluation of the results of changing permafrost on the water resources. Stable isotopes offer valuable information on the connections between changing permafrost (ground ice) and water components. It is therefore particularly important to observe the changes in the stable isotopes of different waterbodies which can vary over hourly to annual timescales and truly capture the thawing signals and reflect the influence of permafrost (ground ice) on the regional hydrological processes. The Beiluhe Basin (BLH) in the hinterland of the QTP was selected; it integrates all the water components related to hydrological cycles well and is an ideal site to study the hydrological effect of permafrost change. This paper presents the temporal data of stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta D, and d-excess) in different waterbodies (precipitation, stream water, thermokarst lake, and groundwater) in the BLH produced between 2017 and 2022. Here, the first detailed stable isotope data of ground ice at 17 boreholes and 2 thaw slumps are presented. A detailed description of the sampling processes, sample pretreating processes, and isotopic data quality control is given. The data first described the full seasonal isotope amplitude in the precipitation, stream, and thermokarst lakes and delineated the depth isotopic variability in ground ice. In total, 554 precipitation samples, 2402 lake/pond samples, 675 stream water samples, 102 supra-permafrost water samples, and 19 sub-permafrost water samples were collected during 6 years of continuous sampling work. Importantly, 359 ground ice samples at different depths from 17 boreholes and 2 profiles were collected. This first dataset provides a new basis for understanding the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation on the QTP. It also provides support for the cryospheric study on the Northern Hemisphere. The dataset provided in this paper can be obtained at 10.5281/zenodo.10684110 (Yang, 2024).

The SAR methods consist of a baseline approach, which estimates the water-covered area from dual-polarized SAR imagery using a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) approach, augmented with ancillary vertical ground displacement information derived from SAR interferometry (InSAR). The meteo-climatological information includes hydrometric water level, rainfall data, and the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Experimental results, obtained using a seven-year time series of SAR scenes collected over the Po River close to the city of Piacenza and contrasted with ancillary external information, demonstrate the soundness of the proposed SAR-based added-value products and their satisfactory accuracy in emphasizing both seasonal trends and the drought phenomena occurred in the area. This paves the way for an operational use of SAR measurements to monitor the water-covered area of the Po River and potentially other similar environments.

However, diffusive and ebullitive CH4 4 emissions in response to nutrients enrichments and tidal fluctuations remain largely constrained. Here, we investigated seasonal and monthly CH4 4 emissions in a nutrient-rich subtropical estuary and evaluated relative contribution of diffusion and ebullition CH4. 4 . Dissolved CH4 4 concentrations were in a range of 0.18-11.2 mu mol L-1,-1 , corresponding to diffusive fluxes of 3.08-375 mu g m- 2 h- 1 along the estuary. Diffusive CH4 4 fluxes were observed to decrease significantly from the upper to lower estuary and were higher in the cold than warm seasons. Turbidity, suspended particulate, NH4+, 4 + , NO3-, 3- , DOC/NO3-and 3- and NO 2 - were the crucial factors affecting CH4 4 fluxes, collectedly explaining 43 % of CH4 4 emissions variability. Ebullitive and diffusive fluxes were significantly higher under ebbing than flooding tides, with an ebullition contribution of 82-98 %. Ecosystem-level temperature sensitivity and apparent activation energy of CH4 4 emissions were higher for ebullitive than diffusive pathways and were also higher under the ebbing than flooding tides, indicating that ebullitive pathway is high temperature and low water depth dependent. It is conservatively projected that CH4 4 emissions would increase by 17 f 9 % and 40 f 22 % under the 2 and 4 degrees C warming scenarios, respectively. These results suggest that enhanced CH4 4 emissions under human activities and climate warming can be refined in further CH4 4 projections and highlight the importance of estuaries in global carbon cycles and climate change.					fu, yuxuan/KFR-9478-2024														0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2024	641								131836	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131836	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131836		AUG 2024											WOS:001294953500001

Factors influencing larval coregonine spatial distribution in Lake Geneva (Europe) and Lake Superior (North America) during a single season near known spawning sites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Survival rate of the larval stage is an important driver of fish recruitment. To understand mechanisms regulating larval survival it is important to understand the relative importance of abiotic and biotic factors that shape larval spatial distributions. We studied larval Coregonus distributions in surface waters (surface to 1 m) by repeatedly sampling study sites in two lakes that varied greatly in trophic state and regional climate. We evaluated the importance of bathymetric depth, Julian Day, edible zooplankton densities (EZ, ind. L-1) and wind vectors on larval spatial distributions using generalized additive modeling. In both systems, larval counts declined in a negative exponential fashion with bathymetric depth, indicating shallow depths are critical nursery habitat. The north-south wind vectors and Julian Day (which was positively correlated with surface temperature) influenced larval distributions in Lake Geneva with larval counts related to both variables linearly, whereas the east-west wind vector and EZ were unimportant. Highest larval counts were during an offshore south wind and declined slightly with Julian Day. In Lake Superior, bathymetric depth and the east-west wind vector influenced larval distributions and were unrelated to EZ, Julian Day, and the north-south wind vector. Larval counts were highest when onshore southwest winds preceded sampling. Differences in how wind affected larval distribution (offshore vs. onshore) might be related to larval size with Lake Superior larvae considerably smaller (average length 12.9 mm vs. 15.9 mm); thus, more apt to be subjected to advection. Within coastal waters, Julian Day and wind vectors influence distributions, but their importance seemingly varies lake-to-lake.

In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal variation of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) density and the effects of FIB variability and sampling frequency on the assessment of a single sample and the annual and final assessment of coastal bathing water quality. Increasing the number of samples from 10 to 20 per bathing season had a significant impact on bathing water quality assessment at sites where water quality fluctuations had previously been observed, resulting in a change in water quality to a lower category in 36 % of annual and 54 % of final assessments, suggesting that the minimum number of samples per season should be increased at such sites. Increasing the number of samples at sites assessed as excellent over a longer period had no impact on water quality assessment. Spatial and temporal variations in FIB density were significant at a considerable number of sites both in the single sample assessment and in the annual and final assessment. Bathing water quality was spatially unrepresentative at a quarter of the sites analyzed and temporally unrepresentative at a fifth, as there was at least one additional point with a lower bathing water quality than the official sampling point or the bathing water quality was lower in the afternoon than in the morning. When revising the current recreational water quality regulations, the impact of sampling frequency of and of spatio-temporal variation of FIB density on the relevance of bathing water quality assessment at sites subjected to pollution needs to be seriously considered.

J	Aliagha, UG; Mustafa, FB				Aliagha, Uche Godwin; Mustafa, Firuza Begham			Urban lake physicochemical parameters seasonal and vertical variability within the context of ecological disturbance theory	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The aims of this study are threefold: (1) to determine the seasonal, vertical and lateral variations in the concentrations of physicochemical water quality parameters [pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), NH3-N, PO4, PO4-P] in the Varsity Lake Malaysia, (2) derive a discriminant function that highlights the metals that contributed or had the greatest effect on the seasonal variation and (3) assess the extent to which the water quality has degenerated base on two water quality guidelines. The water samples were analysed using standard methods while the variations in physicochemical parameters concentration were analysed using discriminant analysis method. The results of Wilks' Lambda F-test and canonical discriminant function showed a highly significant seasonal variation in five parameters (P < 0.001; DO, pH, temperature, TDS, NH3-N; and strong significant variation in two parameters (P < 0.05; PO4, PO4-P) with the wet season having greater concentrations. Based on the standardised discriminant function and structure matrix, DO, pH, and TDS were the parameters with the most significant discriminant power, thus made the highest effect on the seasonal differences in concentration. Significant vertical variations were detected for DO, pH, temperature and TDS. But NH3-N and PO4 concentrations did not vary significantly with depth. DO and pH failed the Malaysian National Water Quality, while Temperature out rightly failed the water quality guidelines. From the theoretical perspective, it is predicted that the lake will experience seasonal, vertical and lateral ecological disturbances. The parameters that contribute most to the ecological disturbances are DO, pH, PO4 and PO4-P.					B.

J	Çitgez, T; Eker, R; Aydin, A				Citgez, Tarik; Eker, Remzi; Aydin, Abdurrahim			Spatio-temporal analysis of snow depth and snow water equivalent in a mountainous catchment: Insights from in-situ observations and statistical modelling	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This research, conducted in the mountainous catchment near Abant Lake in the Western Black Sea region of T & uuml;rkiye, aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) throughout the snow season from December 2019 to March 2020, encompassing both accumulation and melting periods. In total, 14 snow surveys were conducted, covering 58 permanent snow measurement points (PSMP) marked with snow poles. The classification and regression tree (CART) method was employed to statistically analyse their relationships with eight variables: snow period, forest canopy, aspect, slope, elevation, slope position, plan and profile curvature. The root mean square error (RMSE) for SD and SWE was determined to be 0.15 m and 46 mm, respectively. The study findings revealed that mean SD and SWE values were higher in forest gaps compared with under-forest and open areas. Although the snow cover disappeared earliest in under-forest areas, the melting rate was observed to be 43% and 17% slower compared with forest gaps and open areas, respectively. Wind redistribution resulted in minimum snow accumulation on western aspects, upper slope positions and ridges, while maximum accumulation was observed on southern aspects, valleys and lower slope positions. Higher elevations (>1580 meters) experienced faster snow melting rates, leading to earlier disappearance of snow cover. PSMPs located on slopes with lower degrees (<15 degrees) exhibited lesser accumulation and earlier snow disappearance. The CART model identified the snow period as the most significant factor in predicting SD and SWE, based on variations in snowfall and air temperature. Other significant variables included forest canopy, aspect and elevation. The study suggests that the CART method is well-suited for modelling complex snow dynamics, providing valuable insights into spatiotemporal variations in SD and SWE in mountainous regions.					; Eker, Remzi/AAY-3790-2020; Çitgez, Tarık/KEJ-6647-2024; EKER, REMZİ/AAY-3790-2020	Citgez, Tarik/0000-0002-0303-5263; Eker, Remzi/0000-0002-9322-9634; AYDIN, Abdurrahim/0000-0002-6572-3395; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				AUG	2024	38	8							e15260	10.1002/hyp.15260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.15260													WOS:001294827300001

In Chile, subsistence fishing provides food to local communities, whereas recreational fishing contributes to economic income via tourism. In the Lanalhue coastal lake basin, unregulated subsistence fishing and formal recreational fishing primarily target large fish species to ensure satisfactory catches and food provision. However, the development of unplanned fishing activities and lack of scientific knowledge can lead to socioecological conflicts and tension between users. To address this issue, this study focuses on improving fishing practices through the analysis of fish assemblages of the Lanalhue lake basin. The life cycle traits of each fish species were analyzed, as well as their abundance and biomass in each habitat. Twelve fish species were identified, and their distribution and abundance explain the differences in fish assemblage composition and structure among habitats. To promote better fishing practices, we propose four target species and specific management actions. These include defining fishing seasons, delineating fishing sites, and establishing fishing quotas. This approach, considering both community structure and functional aspects of fish assemblages, can serve as a valuable guide for developing sustainable fishing practices in the Lanalhue coastal lake basin.

Evaluation of Seasonal Reservoir Water Treatment Processes in Southwest Florida: Protection of the Caloosahatchee River Estuary	WATER												In southwest Florida, the Caloosahatchee River flows from Lake Okeechobee into a biologically productive tidal estuarine system. A combination of excess water during the wet season, insufficient fresh water in the dry season, and poor quality of the river water are damaging the estuarine ecosystem. To better control the quality and quantity of the water entering the estuary, reservoirs are being constructed to store excess, poor quality water during the wet season and return it to the river for discharge into the estuary at an appropriate time. This stored water is enriched in nutrients and organic carbon. Because of the subtropical nature of the climate in southwest Florida and potential increases in temperature in the future, the return flow of water from the reservoirs must be treated before it can be returned to the river. Hence, an experimental water treatment system was developed and operated to compare biological treatment processes consisting of solely wetland plants versus adding some engineered processes, including slow sand filtration and a combination of slow sand filtration and ultraviolet (UV) treatment. These three treatment trains were operated and monitored through a seasonal cycle in 2021-2022. All three treatment methods significantly reduced the concentrations of nutrients and total organic carbon. While the enhanced engineered wetlands' treatment trains did slightly outperform the wetland train, a comparison of the three process trains showed no statistically significant difference. It was concluded that upscaling of the slow sand filtration and UV process could improve the treatment efficiency, but this change would have to be evaluated within a framework of long-term economic benefits. It was also concluded that the Caloosahatchee River water quality is quite enriched in nutrients so that reservoir storage would increase the organic carbon concentrations, making it imperative that it be treated before being returned to the river. It was also discovered that the green alga Cladophora sp. grew rapidly in the biological treatment tubs and will present a significant challenge for the treatment of the reservoir discharge water using the currently proposed alum treatment.

Spatial and Temporal Surveys of Salmon Environmental DNA (eDNA) in a Seattle Urban Creek	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) has a history of conducting traditional fish surveys in urban streams of Seattle, Washington. Limited staff resources have reduced SPU's capacity to monitor fish, and environmental DNA (eDNA) was recognized as an alternative survey method that could potentially improve the efficiency and capacity of SPU-sponsored fish surveys. We performed spatiotemporal surveys of eDNA to assess occupancy and distribution of Chinook Salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Coho Salmon (O. kisutch), and Coastal Cutthroat Trout (O. clarkii clarkii) in Thornton Creek, Seattle, between October 2018 and December 2020. Peak Chinook and Coho eDNA detections occurred in October and October- November, respectively, coinciding with expected adult return time. Chinook and Coho eDNA was detected in May at the time when juveniles outmigrate through the Lake Washington basin. Coastal Cutthroat Trout eDNA was widespread and detected at high rates across seasons, reflecting their ubiquitous distribution. Results from multiscale occupancy modeling suggested that distance upstream affected site-level occupancy probabilities for adult Chinook, but not Coho. Model results also suggested that the probability of Coho and Chinook eDNA occurring in water samples was affected by survey year. Finally, model results suggested that the probability of detecting Chinook eDNA in PCR technical replicates was affected by survey year and collection day but detection of Coho eDNA was only affected by collection day. This study indicates eDNA surveys are effective for assessing distribution and occupancy of salmonids in Seattle's urban streams. Integrating eDNA surveys into urban stream monitoring programs can help alleviate the burden of limited assets facing many resource managers.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	2024	97	3					167	184		10.3955/046.097.0302	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.097.0302													WOS:001410721800002

Long-Term Dynamics of Major Ion Concentrations in the Water of Lake Teletskoe Tributaries in the Context of Biogeochemical Conditions in Their Drainage Basins	WATER RESOURCES												The concentration of major ions (HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+) in the water of tributaries of Lake Teletskoe (Northeastern Altai) was studied in 2016-2020. Seasonal variations were found in the ion composition of the water of lake tributaries and a relationship between this composition and the biogeochemical conditions in their drainage basins was established. The waters of eastern and western tributaries, which drain shores with different geological and landscape structure, differ in both the concentrations and proportions of the major ions. It is shown that most of the examined tributaries belong to the same hydrogeochemical facies and carry water of bicarbonate-magnesium-calcium type. Characteristics of ion runoff of three lake tributaries were calculated; chemical denudation in their drainage basins was evaluated.

In this study, we investigated the trophic ecology and potential trophic niche partitioning of eleven mormyrid fish species from the Sanaga River system in Cameroon using the stable isotope composition of carbon and nitrogen in the muscle samples. Albeit most mormyrids mainly feed on invertebrates, we found differences in isotope ratios, and we report signs of the trophic niche partitioning among species. We further found significant differences in isotopic signatures within the Mormyrus genus, suggesting ecological niche diversification among three closely related species. We have also evaluated differences in the isotopic signals between seasons in four species, which could be possibly caused by species migration and/or anthropogenic agricultural activities. To evaluate body shape, we applied geometric morphometric analyses, and we show that most of the species are clearly morphologically separated. We focused on the mormyrid ecomorphology to identify a possible interaction between shape and ecology, and we found a relationship between the delta 13C (but not delta 15N) isotopic signal and morphology, suggesting their interplay during mormyrid evolution. Overall, we present robust evidence of the trophic niche partitioning within the mormyrid species community, and we integrate trophic ecology with morphometrics, shedding light on the enigmatic evolutionary history of these fascinating African fishes. The study is focused on the trophic ecology of Mormyridae based on the stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen. We report on differences of the isotopic signal among eleven mormyrid species from the Sanaga River in Cameroon, and we provide evidence for trophic niche differentiation within the genus Mormyrus. We also noticed a potential relationship between the snout shape and the trophic position, and we further found an effect of seasonality on isotopic signatures.image					Petrtyl, Miloslav/JOK-6269-2023; Horka, Petra/D-6591-2015; Musilova (fish), Zuzana/S-2899-2017; Jandova, Katerina/E-2515-2016; Musilova, Zuzana/S-2899-2017	Musilova (fish), Zuzana/0000-0001-8759-8663; Indermaur, Adrian/0000-0002-3048-8911; Jandova, Katerina/0000-0002-3166-9175; 													2045-7758					AUG	2024	14	8							e70173	10.1002/ece3.70173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70173								39206461					WOS:001298572600001

Mallikarjuna			Multivariate Analysis for Assessment of Vamsadhara River Water Quality, Andhra Pradesh, India	ORIENTAL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Vamsadhara is a prominent river in north-western Andhra Pradesh. Without enough and reliable knowledge on the quality of the water, people utilize it for home and agricultural purposes quite a lot. This study aims to evaluate the quality of river water for agricultural and domestic consumption. Water samples from 10 sampling stations were collected during the pre and post-monsoon seasons of 2021, and the water quality index and agricultural indices were computed. The Water Quality Index was found to be satisfactory in both the seasons. Correlation and regression analyses are performed to understand the relationship between various hydrochemical parameters. The pre-season and post-season principal components were found to explain 81.3% and 78.9% of the total variance, respectively. The variables in both seasons are solely hydro-chemical and are believed to result from geological processes, suggesting geogenic sources. Water quality parameters for irrigation are within the limits. In irrigated soils, a higher growth of exchangeable Na is typically encouraged by elevated Mg levels. Water with a magnesium hazard level below fifty is considered suitable for irrigation. The Mg hazard was slightly excessive in most of the examined locations of the Vamsadhara River. The river water quality for irrigation is good to excellent, with exemptions from MH.

A nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) release experiment was conducted to reveal the risk. Bare soil and arable soil were used as underlying soils. Overlying water with two sediment concentrations (formed 1 cm and 4 cm thickness layer after deposited, respectively) was used to simulate reserved floods. Higher nutrient content in arable soil led to faster nutrient release into overlying water (16-21 and 0.32-1.32 mg/d<middle dot>cm2 for TN and TP, respectively) relative to bare soil (5-13.5 and 0.25-1.26 mg/d<middle dot>cm2 for TN and TP, respectively), suggesting that bare land with lower nutrient content is better than arable land for storing flood water. Nutrient content in sediment deposit layer relative to in original underlying soil determined whether deposited sediment accelerated or mitigated the release of nutrients into overlying water. Because sediment has higher nutrient content than bare soil, the preferred time to impound flood is at the end of flood seasons when sediment load steeply decreases. It is more likely to suffer eutrophication in the initial stage of flood impounding, when overlying water was abundant in both nitrogen and phosphorus and N/P ratio (10-23) was fit for phytoplankton growth. This study helps to identify the risk of eutrophication due to reserving turbid flood water in polders.

We conducted 12-year monthly repeated surveys to explore the interactive and lag effects of environmental factors on snail density and to monitor their long-term and seasonal trends in a bottomland around the Dongting Lake region in China. Relevant environmental data were obtained from multiple sources. A Bayesian kernel machine regression model and a Bayesian temporal model combined with a distributed lag model were constructed to analyze interactive and lag effects of environmental factors on snail density. The results indicated the average annual snail density in the study site exhibited an increasing and then decreasing trend, peaking in 2013. Snail densities were the highest in October and the lowest in January in a year. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and water level were the most effective predictors of snail density, with potential interactions among temperature, precipitation, and NDVI. The mean minimum temperature in January, water level, precipitation and NDVI were positively correlated with snail density at lags ranging from 1 to 4 months. These findings could serve as references for relevant authorities to monitor the changing trend of snail density and implement control measures, thereby reducing the occurrence of schistosomiasis.					; Gong, Yanfeng/IST-9034-2023; huang, junhui/HKO-6659-2023	Gong, Yan-Feng/0000-0003-2540-6560; 													0932-0113	1432-1955				AUG	2024	123	8							301	10.1007/s00436-024-08323-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-024-08323-w								39150558					WOS:001292680600001

Although there were more taxonomic units at the species level than at the functional group level, it remained unclear whether species diversity was more sensitive than functional group diversity to environmental variables. In this study, taxonomic composition and alpha-beta diversity of phytoplankton were investigated in 23 subtropical reservoirs located in the Han River Basin in South China during wet and dry seasons. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM) were employed to validate the response of phytoplankton species and functional group alpha-beta diversities to environmental variables. The results indicated that the community compositions of phytoplankton in eutrophic reservoirs were similar between wet and dry seasons, while there were distinct differences for community composition in oligotrophic-mesotrophic reservoirs between the two seasons. Across all reservoirs, there were no significant differences in alpha and beta diversities of species and functional groups between wet and dry seasons. The SEM and GDM results revealed that total phosphorus was the primary driving factor influencing alpha and beta diversities of species and functional groups in the 23 reservoirs. Meanwhile, the non-linear results of species beta diversity were stronger than the non-linear results of functional group beta diversity, indicating that phytoplankton species exhibited a higher explanatory power in responding to environmental changes compared to that of functional groups. Compared to that of species beta diversity, the response of functional group beta diversity to environmental variables was significantly lower in the dry season. These research findings lead to re-evaluating the common practice relating to the use of phytoplankton functional groups to assess environmental conditions, which may overlook the explanatory power of subtle changes at the species level, especially during periods of habitat diversification in the dry season.																				2076-2607				AUG	2024	12	8							1547	10.3390/microorganisms12081547	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms12081547								39203389					WOS:001304813700001

Little work has been done on the ecology and geographic conservation of this species. To fill this knowledge gap, we constructed species distribution models (SDMs) to analyze the spatial distribution and climatic niche of N. bella, define factors in habitat suitability and estimate potential niche shifts under climate change and inform conservation efforts. Our present-day SDMs indicate the domi-nant environmental elements determining habitat suitability include the proportion of silt in soil, temperature seasonality, percentage of clay and coarse components in soil, and soil class. Our paleodistribution models show a southern distribution within the last glacial maximum, with a shift northward 8,326 to 4,200 years ago. Our projected SDMs for 2050 under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 predict a significant decrease in habitat suitability throughout the entire range of N. bella. As such, N. bella is a species of conservation concern and conservation measures are imperative for its continued existence as a much-needed bioin-dicator for these freshwater ecosystems. Additionally, this ecological knowledge provides the foundation for identifying population sites from which to collect N. bella for future population genetic studies						Davis, Daniel Darwin/0009-0009-3461-1807													1388-7890	2159-6719				JUL 30	2024	27						232	241		10.48156/1388.2024.1917304	http://dx.doi.org/10.48156/1388.2024.1917304													WOS:001411006100003

However, potential alterations in feedback mechanisms between aquatic plants and microorganisms after ecological succession are still unclear. This study delves into the influence of aquatic plants on sediment bacterial diversity and nutrient dynamics across different growth phases using Illumina MiSeq sequencing and diffusive gradients in thin film analysis. Our results indicate that the surface temperature of the research area has increased from 20 to 28 degrees C over the past 25 years, and the dominant species has shifted to Stuckenia pectinata. Constructive species show responsive changes in their organ's stoichiometric characteristics to adapt to environmental changes. The growth of S. pectinata could affect the diffusion fluxes of NH4+-N, NO3--N, P, and Fe at the sediment-water interface. Morever, the deterministic processes of environmental filtering and competition may have altered the microorganisms in the rhizosphere of S. pectinata, temperature, and water depth were major drivers of seasonal microbial changes. These results in the driver-response relationship of multiple stressors in the lake ecosystem may contribute to the development of engineering projects focusing on restoring aquatic plants.

The diversity and structure of the microalgae community are always influenced by the availability of nutrients in the environment, which is one of the causes of water eutrophication. Microalgae are the best biological indicators of pollution and eutrophication in aquatic environments. In this study, the diversity and structure of microalgae were determined and indicator species of eutrophic water were identified in the water of the Loumbila reservoir, a drinking water source in Burkina Faso. Algae and water samples for physico-chemical analyses were collected monthly from January 2014 to June 2015 in three sampling points. Phytoplankton species were observed under a light microscope and identified using standard methods. The results showed that pH, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, conductivity, nitrates and orthophosphates levels showed distinct spatial and seasonal variations at p <= 0.05. The determination of the specific composition and density of microalgae allowed the inventory of 205 species composed of 5 phyla with a higher specific diversity of Chlorophyta (48.30 %) and a higher density of Cyanobacteria (43.71 %). Analysis of microalgae diversity showed a Shannon-Wiener index varying from 3.11 to 3.60 between sampling points and from 1.70 to 3.73 between seasons. Microcystis aeruginosa, Pediastrum duplex, Pediastrum simplex and Aulacoseira granulata were identified as indicator species for eutrophic water. This study provides basic information on the diversity and structure of microalgae in water reservoirs. It also provides elements for a future assessment of the water quality of drinking water sources using indicator algal species to prevent or reduce eutrophication phenomena.

Saturated constructed wetlands for the remediation of cylindrospermopsin and microcystin-LR: Plants, microbes, and biodegradation pathways	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Harmful cyanobacterial blooms will be more intense and frequent in the future, contaminating surface waters with cyanotoxins and posing a threat to communities heavily reliant on surface water usage for crop irrigation. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are proposed to ensure safe crop irrigation, but more research is needed before implementation. The present study operated 28 mesocosms in continuous mode mimicking horizontal subsurface flow CWs. Mesocosms were fed with synthetic lake water and spiked periodically with two cyanotoxins, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and cylindrospermopsin (CYN), at environmentally relevant cyanotoxins concentrations (10 mu g L- 1). The influence of various design factors, including plant species, porous media, and seasonality, was explored. The mesocosms achieved maximum MC-LR and CYN mass removal rates of 95 % and 98 %, respectively. CYN removal is reported for the first time in CWs mimicking horizontal sub-surface flow CWs. Planted mesocosms consistently outperformed unplanted mesocosms, with Phragmites australis exhibiting superior cyanotoxin mass removal compared to Juncus effusus. Considering evapotranspiration, J. effusus yielded the least cyanotoxin-concentrated effluent due to the lower water losses in comparison with P. australis. Using the Pk-C* model, different scaling-up scenarios for future piloting were calculated and discussed. Additionally, bacterial community structure was analyzed through correlation matrices and differential taxa analyses, offering valuable insights into their removal of cyanotoxins. Nevertheless, attempts to validate microcystin-LR biotransformation via the known mlrA gene degradation pathway were unfruitful, indicating alternative enzymatic degradation pathways occurring in such complex CW systems. Further investigation into the precise molecular mechanisms of removal and the identification of transformation products is needed for the comprehensive understanding of cyanotoxin mitigation in CW. This study points towards the feasibility of horizontal sub-surface flow CWs to be employed to control cyanotoxins in irrigation or recreational waters.

They are relatively volatile and water soluble and undergo atmospheric exchange with water bodies and soil. Here we report air-surface exchange of HMB compounds brominated anisoles and chlorinated dimethoxybenzenes in a Subarctic lake and catchment in Sweden during September 2022. HMBs were isolated from water on solid-phase extraction cartridges and from ground litter/soil by solvent extraction and determined by capillary gas chromatography - quadrupole mass spectrometry. Identified compounds in lake and stream water in the 10-100 pg L- 1 range were 1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3,6-dimethoxybenzene (DAME) > 2,4-dibromoanisole (DiBA) >= 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TriBA) > 1,2,3,4-tetrachloro-5,6-dimethoxybenzene (tetrachloroveratrole, TeCV). DAME and the related compound 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-4-methoxyphenol (DA) are reported in Subarctic litter/soil in the range 0.005-1.1 mg kg- 1 dry weight (dw), whereas DiBA and TriBA were not detected in any litter/soil sample and TeCV in only one. Exchanges were assessed from concentrations in water and soil, air concentrations from a monitoring station at Pallas, Finland, and the physicochemical properties of the HMBs. Fluxes to and from the lake were estimated using the two-film gas exchange model. Net loadings (deposition minus volatilization) for the month of September were - 23, -15 and - 68 g for DiBA, TriBA and DAME, respectively, which amounted to about 4-7 % of the estimated lake inventory. An exchange assessment for DAME from litter/soil showed significant net volatilization at five sites, net deposition at one site and near-equilibrium at one site. The Tornetrask catchment appeared close to steady state with respect to HMB exchange during September 2022. The situation could be different during the warmer and colder seasons, and extending the study to cover these periods is a suggested next step.

The model was calibrated (data: May 2015-April 2016) and validated (data: May 2016-April 2017) against monthly field data of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, phosphate) and chlorophyll a collected from Kigoma Bay in the northern part of the lake. Data of nutrients and discharge from the rivers (Ruzizi and Malagarasi) and atmospheric dry and wet deposition were derived from the literature. The model generally showed good agreement with the observed data for water temperature, dissolved oxygen and nutrients during the calibration and validation periods. The model satisfactorily reproduced the lake's seasonal dynamics (dry and wet seasons) induced by the lake's hydrodynamic processes. We found that both internal and external sources contribute importantly to total nutrient loading in the lake. Our results indicate that nutrient supply from rivers into Lake Tanganyika is more important than previously known. However, we call for further studies to investigate the contribution of other sources of regenerated nutrients (e.g. N2 2-fixation) to the overall primary productivity of Lake Tanganyika.

Habitat occupancy of the threatened Diademed Plover (Phegornis mitchellii) is not affected by llama grazing or peatland size, but declines with peatland humidity	PLOS ONE												Many habitat-specialist organisms occur in distinct, patchy habitat, yet do not occupy all patches, and an important question is why apparently suitable habitat remains unoccupied. We examined factors influencing patch occupancy in near-threatened, little-known Diademed Plovers (Phegornis mitchellii), arguably the bird most specialized to life in High Andean peatlands. Andean peatlands are well-suited to occupancy modelling because they are discrete patches of humid habitat within a matrix of high-altitude steppe. We hypothesized that Diademed Plovers occupy preferably larger and more humid peatlands, and avoid peatlands used for grazing by llamas and vicu & ntilde;as, which may trample vegetation and nests. From December 2021 to February 2022 (breeding season), we conducted plover occupancy surveys (2-4) on 40 peatlands at Lagunas de Vilama, a landscape of arid steppe and wetlands above 4,500 m in NW Argentina. We measured peatland size, grazing pressure, topographic and remotely-sensed variables that correlate with humidity, and incorporated these as covariates in occupancy models. Occupancy models showed that more than 50% of the studied peatlands were used by Diademed Plovers and most showed signs of reproduction, highlighting the importance of the Vilama Wetlands for Diademed Plover conservation. Within peatlands, Diademed Plovers were most often associated with headwaters. The top ranked occupancy model included constant detection, random spatial effects, and a single occupancy covariate: mean NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index, an index correlated with water content and humidity) over the previous three years. Contrary to our prediction, Diademed Plovers preferred less water-saturated peatlands (lower NDWI), possibly to avoid nest flooding. This may be especially important in wet years, like the year when we conducted our surveys. Neither peatland size nor grazing by llamas and vicu & ntilde;as affected peatland use by Diademed Plovers, suggesting that llama grazing at current levels may be compatible with plover conservation. For organisms that specialize on humid habitats, such as peatlands, factors affecting occupancy may vary temporally with variation in climate, and we recommend follow-up surveys across multi-year timescales to untangle the impact of climate on animals' use of humid habitats.

A strong seasonality in water input leads to the contraction and extension of wetlands in the floodplains. The extreme evapotranspiration and little precipitation lead to a difference in the hydrogen isotope signature of rain, soil and river water. Biomarkers, such as plant waxes, are stored in the soils and preserved on geological timescales. To understand which signal is preserved in the stable isotope signatures of plant waxes, soils along a 250 m-long transect spanning waterlogged to dry soils were collected over several seasons and three years. In addition, plants, and plant and soil water were collected along this transect. First, carbon isotope ratios (813C) of plant waxes (i.e, n-fatty acids) were used to classify their metabolism. 813C of bulk organic matter and individual n-fatty acids analyzed in the soils show a strong dependance on the type of vegetation found along the transect (C3 versus C4 plants). Hydrogen isotope ratios (82H) of water present in soil showed that shallow-rooted C4 grasses use superficial soil water, whereas the xylem water 82H content in trees growing near the flooded channel indicated the use of river water. In addition, plant hydrogen fractionation between lipids and rain showed a strong influence of carbon metabolisms with larger fractionation for C3 plants compared with C4 grasses. n-fatty acid 82H ratios in surface soils followed the hydrological variation in the Delta with its floods and dry periods. Hence 82H of long-chain fatty acids seems to track the river-level variation rather than precipitation.

However, its aquaculture development for sustainable utilization is challenged by cryptic identity amidst the presence of morphotypes of unknown size and genetic relatedness. This study aimed to investigate the maximum sizes and evolutionary links of chelae morphotypes in M. vollenhovenii for precise identification and utilization in a 3 x 2 randomized block experimental design. Ninety biggest encountered samples of M. vollenhovenii chelae morphotypes-those possessing equal left and right side chelae, longer left chelae, and shorter left chelae-were obtained from fisherfolks' catches at each of Asejire Lake and Ogun River during peak seasons (July-September) bimonthly field survey, representing EAAL, LLAL, SLAL-GAALs, and EAOR, LLOR, SLOR-GAORs. These were analyzed for differences (p < 0.05) in size-linked parameters-length (L (cm)), weight (W (g)), and condition factor (K). Specimens' 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences were utilized to infer phylogenetic linkages, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and amino acid translations alongside NCBI references (NCBIrefseq). Results Weight (W) and condition factor (K), among GAALs, for SLAL and LLAL were similar; EAAL was significantly lowest; among GAORs, SLOR and LLOR were similar; and EAOR was significantly lowest. In GAALs, EAAL, LLAL, and SLAL had higher L, W, and K than counterpart GAORs. Sequences formed two polyphyletic groups: EAOR branch from EAAL, in which 100.0%EA rooted 75.0% NCBIrefseqs, forming a clade; and GAOR-SLOR and LLOR branch form GAOR-LLAL rooted SLAL, in which 100.0%LL and SL rooted KJ463387.1 (Badagry), forming another clade. SNP Locus 91 separated 100.0%GAOR from 100.0%GAAL and 100.0%NCBIrefseqs translating to valine; SNP Locus 171 separated 100.0%EA and its co-rooted NCBIrefseqs from 100.0%LL, SL, and their co-rooted NCBIrefseq, translating to glycine/glutamic acid change. Conclusion The equal left and right side chelae and the unequal left and right side chelae specimens are, respectively, small- and robust-sized, irrespective of habitat. They are divergent size-linked clades having protein translate differences, delineable at 16S rRNA SNP Locus 171; their size variant habitat strains are delineable at SNP Locus 91. These SNP markers will be useful for precision identification and selection of the size variant chelae morph strains for sustainable utilization.

Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to analyze the bacterial and archaeal communities in biofilm-sediment samples over three years, to understand the dynamic changes in the microbial community. PICRUSt and shotgun metagenomics were used to examine energy production and carbohydrate metabolism pathways. The dominant bacterial phyla were Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Cyanobacteriota, and Pseudomonadota, while Halobacteriota was the predominant archaeal phylum. Despite seasonal environmental fluctuations, the biofilm community remained stable over time, suggesting resilience. The Calvin-Benson cycle was the main carbon fixation pathway, carried out by Cyanobacteria and purple non-sulfur bacteria. Nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs supplied an important nitrogen source. Organic carbon was derived primarily from autotrophs, with little use of allochthonous plant material. The comparison of biofilm-sediment and water column biotopes showed distinct but related prokaryote communities. Biofilm-sediments showed higher taxonomic diversity and different proportions of microbial phyla compared to the water column. This study provides initial insights into the complex microbial life in endorheic lagoons and underscores the importance of protecting these globally threatened habitats. The limited sample size in this study warrants further investigation with a more comprehensive sampling strategy to fully characterize the microbial communities and their functional roles in the different biotopes of La Muerte lagoon.

Breeding Common Scoters Melanitta nigra in Scotland's Flow Country: a population in decline despite productivity being stable	BIRD STUDY												Capsule The breeding productivity of the Common Scoter population in Scotland's Flow Country remained relatively stable during a 44% population decline in Britain and Ireland. Aim To investigate breeding productivity changes in the eastern Flow Country's Common Scoter population over 22 years and identify possible threats and causes of change during a period of national population decline. Methods Common Scoters from 32 breeding sites were surveyed annually between 2002 and 2023. Each site was visited two to three times in May (pre-nesting period) and two to three times in July and August (post-hatching period) to record the numbers of adult and juvenile Common Scoters. Results Between 2002 and 2023, whilst the Common Scoter population declined (approximately 44% from 27 to 15 breeding pairs) across the study area, breeding productivity (defined as large ducklings per female) remained stable, averaging 0.44 (range of annual means 0.00-1.06) large ducklings per female. The number of small ducklings per female also remained relatively stable. A year of higher breeding productivity did not result in an increase in the number of breeding females in the following years, suggesting that the cause of the population decline lies away from the breeding region. Conclusion Breeding productivity needs to increase, and poor breeding seasons need to be prevented to help maintain this population. The causes of the Common Scoter's decline away from the breeding area need to be resolved to prevent local extinction. This could be assisted with the removal of non-native forestry plantations in the area, which has been observed to benefit other ground-nesting species by alleviating predation pressure, and by maintaining lake habitat quality, as reflected in shallow water and abundant large invertebrates.					; Gullett, Philippa/HLQ-4813-2023	Hancock, Mark Henry/0000-0001-6437-7278; Hughes, Robert/0000-0003-2764-0721; Gullett, Philippa R/0000-0001-7867-2315; Martin-Walker, Alice/0009-0003-9276-8999; Andersen, Roxane/0000-0002-7782-795X													0006-3657	1944-6705				JUL 2	2024	71	3					256	269		10.1080/00063657.2024.2384950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2024.2384950		JUL 2024											WOS:001295938600001
J	Gaines, MD; Tulbure, MG; Perin, V; Composto, R; Tiwari, V				Gaines, Mollie D.; Tulbure, Mirela G.; Perin, Vinicius; Composto, Rebecca; Tiwari, Varun			Projecting Surface Water Area Under Different Climate and Development Scenarios	EARTHS FUTURE												Changes in climate and land-use/land-cover will impact surface water dynamics throughout the 21st century and influence global surface water availability. However, most projections of surface water dynamics focus on climate drivers using local-scale hydrological models, with few studies accounting for climate and human drivers such as land-use/land-cover change. We used a data-driven, machine learning model to project seasonal surface water areas (SWAs) in the southeastern U.S. from 2006 to 2099 that combined land-cover and climate projections under eight different development and emissions scenarios. The model was fitted with historic Landsat imagery, land-use/land-cover, and climate observation data (mean squared error 0.14). We assessed the change in SWA for each scenario, and we compared the surface water projections from our data-driven model and a process-based model. We found that the scenario with the largest forest-dominated land cover loss and most extreme climate change had watersheds with the greatest projected increases (in the South Atlantic Gulf) and decreases (in the Lower Mississippi) in SWA. When compared to the increase or decrease in surface water projected by the process-based model, most of the watersheds across scenarios agreed on the direction of change. Our findings highlight the importance of forest-dominated land cover in maintaining stable surface water availability throughout the 21st century, which can inform land-use management policies for adaptation and water-stress mitigation as well as strategies to prepare for future flood and drought events. Climate change and land cover change, such as deforestation and urban growth, impact the surface water such as rivers, reservoirs, and lakes. Surface water is the most easily accessible resource for water use, such as irrigation, public water supply, and power generation. As the climate and land cover continue to change and our water demand increases, we need to understand possible changes in surface water availability to plan ahead. To get an idea of some of these possibilities, we projected SWAs for watersheds in the southeastern U.S. for eight different climate-land cover change scenarios. We found that forested land cover was important in maintaining consistent SWAs. Our scenario where the study area lost a large amount of forested land cover had the watersheds with the most dramatic changes in SWA-both increases and decreases. The scenario where the amount of forested land cover was the most similar to today projected the least amount of change in SWA. Having these scenarios, and understanding the importance of forests in surface water dynamics can help decision-makers plan for climate impacts on water supply and demand, including future floods and droughts. Projected seasonal changes in surface water area (SWA) from 2006 to 2099 for eight spatially and temporally changing climate and land-use scenarios Scenario with the most forest-loss had the largest watershed changes in SWA-positive and negative-and most increase overall Changes in surface water projected by our data-driven model were supported by projections from a process-based model with similar inputs					Tulbure, Mirela G/B-3030-2012; Perin, Vinicius/ABI-7518-2020; Tiwari, Varun/KBQ-2274-2024; Tulbure, Mirela/M-1212-2019	Tulbure, Mirela G/0000-0003-1456-183X; Gaines, Mollie/0000-0001-9166-8150														2328-4277				JUL	2024	12	7							e2024EF004625	10.1029/2024EF004625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024EF004625													WOS:001271525800001

Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China. The surface area of this shallow lake, located in the central and lower catchment of the Yangtze River, southeastern China, varies across the year based on the precipitation. A steel platform was built in the northeast open -water area of the lake to measure surface energy fluxes and other related atmospheric/hydrologic variables during a cold season from 1 December 2020 to 28 February 2021. The results show the average water surface temperature was 1.25 degrees C higher than the 2 m height air temperature, though temperature inversions occasionally occurred for short periods. The average wind speed and friction velocity were small, leading to weak turbulent mechanical mixing. Consequently, consistently positive and moderate latent and sensible heat fluxes (17.4 and 5.4 W/m 2 , respectively) values were produced due to the effects of turbulent mixing from thermal and mechanical factors. The monthly average albedo was large at mid-day (0.086). The low Bowen ratio (about 0.37) also indicates that more latent heat is released than sensible heat. When dry and cold air passed over the lake, the pressure of vapor and air temperature decrease significantly, the turbulent mechanical mixing is enhanced and the energy budget changed. As a consequence, the Ts-Ta, e s -e a values, and sensible and latent heat fluxes all increase.

This study assessed seasonal variations of microplastics and the water quality of Njoro River and Lake Nakuru. Selected water physico-chemical parameters were measured. Microplastic abundance in the surface water samples in the dry season was recorded as 47-649 MPs 300L-1 for sampling points in Njoro River and 54-508 microplastics (MPs) 300L-1 for Fisher's Point in Lake Nakuru; an abundance during the rainy season was measured as 8-389 MPs 300L-1 and 28-259 MPs 300L-1 for Njoro River and Lake Nakuru, respectively. Our study observed a significant pattern of microplastics from polymers such as polyethylene (20%), polypropylene (25%), polyester (40%) and polyethylene terephthalate (10%). Salinity ranged between 0.085 to 2.59 +/- 0.03 ppt; temperature 23.69-14.22 +/- 0.07 degrees C; pH 8.8-9.3; turbidity 13.95-36.03 +/- 0.35 NTU; TN 5.9 to 8.57 +/- 3.24 mg L-1; TP 7.49-.41 +/- 1.84 mg L-1; EC 73.3-533.3 +/- 0.64 mu s cm-1; and TDS 46.67-243.33 +/- 0.11ppm. These ranges were within the standards recommended by WHO and US EPA. Results indicate the possibility for the quantity and mass of plastic particles in Lake Nakuru to surpass that of Njoro River.

The dropstone from well Ao14 was further studied using computed tomography (CT) scanning, sporopollen, carbon and oxygen isotope, and zircon UePb isotope analyses. The results show that the dropstone is composed of quartz monzonite and has an age of 178.0 +/- 3.3 Ma. Based on the bedrock age analysis around the Songliao Basin, it is suggested that the dropstone in well Ao14 may have originated from the Zhangguangcai Range. The palynoflora assemblage indicates a mixed survival of cold and warm palynomorphs. The carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of the synsedimentary calcareous clasts surrounding the dropstone exhibit obvious negative biases, suggesting that glacier meltwater flowed into the paleo-lake, probably due to the significant topographic height difference between the Songliao Basin and adjacent areas during the early Santonian. Additionally, it can be inferred that coastal mountains formed in the Zhangguangcai Range area, which is located southeast of the Songliao Basin, and the dropstones derived from this region. During the cold season, the dropstones may be transported to the edge of Songliao Lake by avalanche and mixed with carbonate debris. As the seasons changed, the lake ice broke into pieces and carrying the dropstones and carbonate debris into the deep lake area. The present research provides direct evidence of a brief global cold event and the presence of high mountains in the southeastern Songliao Basin during the early Santonian in the Cretaceous greenhouse world.

It selected monitoring wells in different regions of the basin and analyzed the annual and seasonal fluctuations in groundwater levels before and after the water diversion. According to the findings, there is a notable shift in the rate of change in groundwater levels of the irrigated areas of the Minqin Basin: from an average of 0.62 m per year between 2001 and 2007 to a mere 0.01 m per year between 2008 and 2022. Since 2010, the groundwater level in the Qingtu Lake has increased by 1.01 m. The decline of Minqin Basin's groundwater levels slowed down, and some places even witnessed rises in the groundwater level. The water levels in the region are generally stable.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2024	319								100514	10.1016/j.dwt.2024.100514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dwt.2024.100514		JUN 2024											WOS:001293339100001
J	Dasgupta, B; Prakash, P; Sen, R; Noble, J; Chatterjee, S; Sanyal, P				Dasgupta, Bibhasvata; Prakash, Puneet; Sen, Rahul; Noble, Jacob; Chatterjee, Shamik; Sanyal, Prasanta			The isotopic composition of the world's highest river basins: Role of hydrological mixing ratios and transit time	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Hydrological mixing models rely on assumptions governing the rate and timing of mixing proportions, the degree to which isotope ratios conserve the mixing ratios and the estimation of the prior behaviour of meteoric reservoirs. However, these models only describe the integrated catchment response based on different sources having unique and constant isotopic compositions as opposed to location-specific information. Erroneous projection of the hydrological budget can have severe repercussions on climate and eco-hydrological studies, estimation of freshwater availability, and civil and engineering work. Consequently, we design a real-time, multi-parameter, hydrometeorological-constrained, Bayesian-mixing model that can relate meteoric reservoirs to streamflow, and temporal and spatial behaviour of flow paths. Developed for pan-Himalayan catchments (up to 5200 m), with four end-members and pre/post-monsoon seasonality, the isotopic analysis reveals distinct 518O values: stream water (-9 f 2.6 %o), snowpack (-10.7 f 8.1 %o), lake water (-12.2 f 2.5 %o), and groundwater (-8.4 f 1.6 %o). Initial results based on the isotope-enabled, flux-weighted mixing didn't fully capture spatiotemporal isotopic heterogeneity, affecting hydrograph separation. A revised model, considering the transit time of meteoric reservoirs before their mixing with river discharge, was developed. The revised model illustrates that isotopeenabled mixing models must also consider the hydrometeorological properties of individual reservoirs, the high probability of intermixing between the various reservoirs, and the variable transit time of different meteoric waters in a catchment. With implications for isotope-enabled hydrology, this work describes a novel method applicable to high-mountain hydrology, separating them from other montane or lowland geographies.

The Late Oligocene flora of Aschudasty, Zaisan depression (East Kazakhstan)	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The Late Oligocene is the time of the flourishing of typical warm temperate Turgay vegetation in Kazakhstan and adjacent areas. The Aschudasty flora described here originates from the Oshagandy Formation which correlates with the early part of the Chattian. The palaeobotanical analysis reveals 38 plant taxa, identified by macro- and microfloral remains related to Lycopodiophyta (1), Pteridophyta (3), Gymnospermae (7), Gnetophyta (1), Magnoliophyta (25) and plantae incerta sedis (1). Macrofossils include mainly Cupressaceae ( Metasequoia , Taxodium and Glyptostrobus ), Betulaceae ( Alnus, Corylus ) and Ulmus , as well as large number of monocots and aquatic ferns. The palynospectrum is dominated by pollen of the genus Picea (about 30%) and Alnus (about 40%), with noticeable amounts of pollen from other birch genera (about 7% in total). Plant functional type (PFT) and Coexistence Approach were used for palaeoenviromental reconstructions. Vegetation reconstruction shown that the microflora has a very temperate aspect reflecting a mixed deciduous conifer forest with a diverse, mainly deciduous shrub layer. The macroflora also reflects deciduous forest vegetation with conifers and possibly a very minor evergreen component. The climatic analysis shows a seasonal temperate climate. The pollen data reflect the zonal regional vegetation, the macroflora most probably reflects the lakeside wetland vegetation which may have experienced a warmer microclimate, compared to the upland realm. In whole significant climatic changes was not documented since Early Oligocene Rupelian time.																			0034-6667	1879-0615				AUG	2024	327								105138	10.1016/j.revpalbo.2024.105138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2024.105138		JUN 2024											WOS:001255634800001
J	Chávez-García, FJ; Quintanar, L				Chavez-Garcia, Francisco J.; Quintanar, Luis			Analyzing possible seismic velocity changes in Mexico City using seismic noise interferometry	SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING												The seismic response of the Mexico City basin has received plenty of attention as one of the most relevant cases of ground motion amplification. A recent study showed possible velocity variations of the deposits in both the lake bed and firm ground. A clear drop in seismic velocity was observed during the 2017.09.19 earthquake (Mw 7.1) in addition to more subtle seismic velocity changes related to seasonal temperature and precipitation. We use continuous seismic noise data recorded in a 29 broadband seismograph network in and around Mexico City to investigate Rayleigh wave group velocity structure and velocity changes. We estimate Green's functions (GF) between station pairs using seismic noise cross-correlation. An average estimate is computed for each of three five-day periods of recording. GFs are dominated by a Rayleigh pulse at low frequencies (between 0.1 and 0.2 Hz). Velocity changes are investigated through the comparison between GF's for different five-day periods. No velocity variations are observed. Station pairs separated at a distance smaller than 20 km also show some Rayleigh wave energy at higher frequencies, between 0.3 and 1.2 Hz. We repeated the analysis in a higher frequency band (up to 5 Hz) and show that again no velocity variation can be observed. In addition, we used horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios computed for both earthquake and seismic noise records to identify possible non-linear effects during the 2017 earthquake. The results showed that significant non-linear effects during that event are to be discarded. Finally, we present preliminary results of a tomography of Rayleigh wave group velocity at the center of the array. Lateral structure variations below the geotechnical zonation are significant. Our data will be useful to constrain the structure of the volcanic deposits of the Transmexican Volcanic Belt (TVB).

Initial settlement of the Upper Volga region, Centre of the East European Plain, in the Late Glacial and Early Holocene (based on geoarchaeological research in the Zabolotsky peat bog area)	ANTHROPOLOGIE												The study of the settlement of the Central European Plain during the Late Glacial time has until recently been hampered by the predominance of the view that large glacial lakes were widespread in the upper Volga basin during the Valdai (Weichselian) glaciation, which prevented settlement of vast territories and population migration to the ice-free Fennoscandia from the east and south-east. According to the glacial lake concept, the lowlands along the Dubna River - a tributary of the Volga River - were occupied by the vast Tver Lake in the Late Valdai epoch, the presence of which was previously thought to exclude the possibility of its development until the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, when the process of deglaciation finally drained those areas. To test this concept, special geoarchaeological studies were undertaken, which included, in addition to traditional archaeological research, the study of the development history of landscapes by methods of geology and geomorphology. It was established that fluvial rather than lacustrine environments dominated the area during the Late Valdai Ice Age, which made possible its occupation by prehistoric population. In support of that, radiocarbon ages of around 15,500 cal BP were obtained from the artifacts correspondtraditions. Later, in the Early Holocene, there is a transformation of the Ressetian industry into the Zadnepilevo culture. Seasonal recorded not only by materials of the East European Plain, but also the Scandinavian Peninsula, where the monuments of "eastern impulse" are represented.

However, improving the accuracy of geological age has always been a difficult scientific problem. A 609-m-thick, continuous lacustrine mudstone and sandstone succession in Chezhen Sag (eastern China) provides an ideal middle Eocene sedimentary record for establishing a high-resolution stratigraphic chronology framework. Based on spectrum analysis and sliding window spectrum analysis of the natural gamma (GR) logging data of well Che 271 (C271) in Chezhen Sag, the periods of 405 kyr and 40.1 kyr were filtered by a Gaussian bandpass filter, and a "flngting" astrochronological time scale (ATS) was established. The total number of 405 kyr eccentricity cycles were 13.6 and 40.1 kyr obliquity cycles were 138 which recorded from the upper member 4 (Es4U) to the member 3 (Es3) of the Eocene Shahejie Formation, and the depositional duration was 5.53 Myr. Correlation Coefficient (COCO) analysis and evolutionary Correlation Coefficient (eCoCo) analysis found that the optimal sedimentary rate of different strata. Sedimentary noise simulation revealed the history of paleolake water changes in the Middle Eocene in the Chezhen Sag, according to which four sequences are divided. The study shows that the lake level change of Chezhen Sag in the middle Eocene shows prominent 1.2 Myr cycles and an antiphase well-coupled relationship with obliquity modulation. Finally, we propose a model to explain the relationship between the orbital cycle and lake level change in the continental lake basin. When the obliquity of the earth increases, the middle and high latitudes of the earth will be closer to the sun, the direct sunlight will be higher, and the meridional sunshine will increase, thus accelerating the evaporation process of lake basin water. When the seasonal changes are obvious (maximum period of 1.2 Myr ultra-long obliquity), this effect is more significant. The relative lake level change based on the restoration of high-precision ATS has significant scientific and economic value for understanding the vertical evolution of continental stratigraphic sequences and the formation and distribution of oil and gas resources.

Host lifestyle and parasite interspecific facilitation mediate co-infection in a species-poor host-parasite system	OIKOS												Despite their important ecological role, questions remain on mechanisms structuring parasite assemblages. We present an endemic and species-poor parasite-host system of two species of clupeid fishes Limnothrissa miodon, Stolothrissa tanganicae) and two species of monogenean parasites (Kapentagyrus, Dactylogyridae) from Lake Tanganyika as a model to study parasite distribution patterns and co-infection dynamics in nature. We modelled spatiotemporal dynamics of parasite-host interaction using infection data along the north-south axis of Lake Tanganyika (660 km) over the course of two seasons and four years (1730 fish, 3710 parasites). We found temporal stability of parasite infection, which contrasts with previously reported seasonally driven fluctuations of fish host abundances. We found a difference in spatial structure between the parasite species which follows the contrasting dispersal pattern of their respective host species. On L. miodon, the host species that is infected by the two parasite species, we discovered a positive correlation with host body size for one parasite species, and a negative correlation for the other species. The apparent host-size related replacement in the two parasite species infecting L. miodon contrasts with the beneficial influence that each of the parasite species has on the other. Parasites have been reported in previous studies to change habitat depending on host size/age. Differences in abundance and prevalence here reported between parasite species infecting the same host species related to the host body length further illustrate the parasites' dependence on changes in lifestyle of the host during its ontogenetic development. Also, possible mechanisms underlying the reported facilitation of infection are discussed. In conclusion, we show that in this closed, species-poor system parasite infection dynamics are dependent on a combination of host mobility, host lifestyle changes over ontogenetic development, and interspecific interactions between parasites.

Analysis of Public Comments on Experimental Regulations for Protecting Black Bass during The Spawning Period in Eastern Ontario Reveals Both Stakeholder Acceptance and Skepticism	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Recreational angling of nesting largemouth bass (Micropterus nigricans) and smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu) can greatly increase nest abandonment, and in the northern clines of their range, decrease recruitment. This is the case in eastern Ontario, where high levels of non-compliance and difficult to enforce regulations have impacted black bass (Micropterus spp.) conservation and management. Effective January 1, 2024 until December 31st, 2025, novel and experimental fishing sanctuaries were imposed on portions of Charleston Lake and Opinicon Lake that prohibit recreational fishing of all types from April 15th to the Friday before the first Saturday in July (encompassing the full bass reproductive season). As part of the formal process to institute these experimental regulations, public comments were collected on the Environmental Registry of Ontario. We examined those comments and identified supportive and non-supportive themes related to these experimental regulations. While a majority of stakeholders were in support of the new regulations, we also noted sub-themes that may hinder regulation acceptance. Those sub-themes include: a perceived lack of enforcement negating the potential benefits of the sanctuaries, under-estimation of the extent of non-compliance with existing regulations such that new regulations are unnecessary, misunderstanding and misinformation, as well as distrust of government and the academic research community. Understanding and addressing these stakeholder perspectives will help researchers studying the new sanctuary areas and managers understand any lack of compliance while informing future decisions about bass management in eastern Ontario and beyond.					; Zhang, Joel/OOK-0203-2025; Nguyen, Vivian/AAO-8682-2020; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X; Lombardo, Justin/0009-0004-6991-9856; Claussen, Julie E./0000-0002-7366-943X; Zhang, Joel/0009-0007-1564-0261; 													0364-152X	1432-1009				SEP	2024	74	3					532	546		10.1007/s00267-024-01996-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-024-01996-0		JUN 2024						38834791					WOS:001238511700001
J	Ding, H; Xu, K; Liu, CB; Yu, JJ				Ding, Han; Xu, Kang; Liu, Chongbin; Yu, Juanjuan			Monitoring Monthly Net-Pen Aquaculture Dynamics of Shallow Lakes Using Sentinel-1 Data: Case Study of Shallow Lakes in Jiangsu Province, China	REMOTE SENSING												Net-pen aquaculture, one of the primary forms of aquaculture in shallow lakes, has generated substantial economic benefits but has also triggered eutrophication and ecological degradation. Therefore, the accurate and scientific dynamic monitoring of aquaculture areas is of the utmost importance. However, existing studies have predominantly employed annual monitoring, failing to fully exploit the unique advantage of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for seasonal, monthly or more frequent time scale monitoring. This study aimed to develop an approach for monitoring the monthly dynamics of net-pen aquaculture using Sentinel-1 time series images. We integrated threshold segmentation and temporal consistency checking to extract spatial data on the net-pen aquaculture from eight typical shallow lakes in Jiangsu Province, one of the eastern coastal provinces of China, from 2016 to 2021. This study yielded the following results: (1) The VV polarization image offers a particularly noticeable contrast between net-pen aquaculture structures and their surroundings and checking for temporal consistency can help alleviate the problem of distinguishing between changes in error caused by misclassification and actual changes that occurred. The overall accuracy of the net-pen aquaculture extraction results was over 85%. (2) This approach not only enables the analysis of changes in the aquaculture area and fence length but can also identify key time points. For instance, the net-pen aquaculture area in Gehu Lake experienced a rapid decline from May to November 2018, the decrease in while Eastern Taihu Lake occurred from September 2018 to June 2019. (3) The removal of net-pen aquaculture in lakes within the Jiangsu Province is primarily attributed to policy responses. In response to the ecological river and lake action plan implemented in Jiangsu Province, a decrease was observed in both the aquaculture areas and fence lengths across most lakes from 2016 to 2021. These results can provide a reference for lake management and ensuring the effective implementation of related policies.

This can contribute to the limited studies on trematode ecology, specifically in aquatic ecosystems. Here, we developed species-specific primer and probe sets for Moliniella anceps, Opisthioglyphe ranae, and Plagiorchis multiglandularis cercariae and applied a novel eDNA qPCR assay to detect larval trematodes quantitatively. We evaluated the effectiveness of the assays using filtered lake water samples collected from different sites of Lake Fadikha and Kargat River Estuary in Lake Chany, Russia, showing high species specificity and sensitivity in all 3 assays. Further, all 3 assays had high efficiencies ranging from 94.9 to 105.8%. Moliniella anceps, O. ranae, and P. multiglandularis were detected in the environmental water samples through real-time PCR. Thus, we anticipate that our approach will be beneficial for biomonitoring, measuring, and managing ecological systems.

The lake is isolated from the sea by a narrow sand hill. Coastal zone is well vegetated with floating leaved marine plants. The lake basin is divided into two sub-basins by a shallow ridge. It has disturbance of seawater by stormy waves. Stable chemoclines are made by salinity variations at depth of 1 m around the year. Dissolved Oxygen was often very low (<1 mgO(2)/L) at hypolimnion. Temperature reverse were detected in November. Nitrate and Ammonium concentrations were also very low (< 0.1 mgN/L), while TN was usually 2.0 similar to 3.5 mgN/L. In general, TN/TP was lower than the Redfield ratio. Transparency was 0.2 similar to 1.7m, and COD, TP, and TN of sediment were 3.1 similar to 40.3 mg O-2/g, 0.91 similar to 1.39 mgP/g, and 0.34 similar to 3.07 mgN/g, respectively. Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentrations were mostly over 40 mg/m(3). Two basins showed different phytoplankton groups with Oscillatoria sp., Trachelomonas sp., Schizochlamys gelatinosa, , and Anabaena spiroides dominant in South basin, and with Trachelomonas sp., Schroederia sp., Schizochlamys gelatinosa, , and Trachelomonas sp. dominant in the North basin. The seasonal progression of phytoplankton was quick, probably because of unexpected variations in physical environments, such as salinity, turbidity, wind, and light.																			2538-5542	2538-2705				JUN	2024	9	2					474	495																WOS:001300517700005
J	Johnson, AA				Johnson, Andrew Alan			Hidden Flows: Hydropower and the Rhythms of Development on the Mekong	PACIFIC AFFAIRS												The Xayaburi Hydroelectric Power Project entered operation in October 2019. After this the Mekong started to behave strangely-the water ran blue and clear instead of red and silty, and the great backflow of the river into Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake arrived off schedule or, at times, threatened to not arrive at all. Villagers who had remained ambivalent or apathetic about hydropower issues suddenly found themselves facing a radically altered world, where a seemingly distant power was able to dramatically alter the nature of their every day. These shifts introduced an arrhythmia into the hydroscape: ecological, fishing, and religious cycles adapted to a seasonal river were off sync with power demands. The radical alteration that dams make to the landscape, in the promise of irrigation, electrification, and the sheer feat of changing a river, are a tangible symbol of the state's power over its land. But with a deep look into hydropower projects-in this case, the dams across the midstream of the conflicting narratives of power: state-focused, international, and royalist; time, where the rhythms of the river change the rhythms of life, and where the cyclical riparian clock clashes with a future-oriented developmentalist notion of time.

In the present research hydrochemical parameters of water and macrophytes diversity in Ghodaghodi lake, Kailali District were studied. Water samples were collected from lake, during the Premonsoon (May) and the Postmonsoon (November) seasons. Hydrochemical parameters viz. temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, the concentration of nitrates and phosphates, free CO2, hardness, conductivity, total dissolved solids of water were analyzed to characterize the water quality of the lake. In addition, macrophytes in the lake were collected and identified. CO2, hardness, temperature and depth were also found to be high during pre -monsoon and these parameters have low values during post -monsoon season. pH, conductivity, alkalinity, DO and TDS, value (+/- SD) was found to be high during post -monsoon with value and low during premonsoon. Total 37 macrophytes species belonging to 22 families were recorded. Out of which only one macroscopic species of algae, two pteridophytes, one bryophyte and 33 angiosperms were recorded. Emergent and members of Poaceae family were dominating during pre -monsoon and post -monsoon. In terms of growth forms, emergents were dominant indicated that higher nutrients content (PO4, NO3). Overall, higher number of macrophytes were recorded during pre -monsoon than postmonsoon season. Macrophytic floral composition changes with seasonal changes of hydrochemical parameters. Therefore, periodic monitoring of water quality with respect to macrophyte diversity is needed for the conservation of the lake.																			0556-3321	2070-3368				JUN	2024	56	3					1059	1065		10.30848/PJB2024-3(40)	http://dx.doi.org/10.30848/PJB2024-3(40)													WOS:001189356500014

The desiccation of lakes leads to severe environmental, economic, and social repercussions. Urmia Lake, located in northwestern Iran and representing a vital natural ecosystem, has experienced a volume reduction of over 90.0%. Our research evaluated diverse water management strategies within the Urmia Lake basin and prospects of inter-basin water transfers. This study focused on strategies to safeguard the environmental water rights of the Urmia Lake by utilizing the modeling and simulating (MODSIM) model. The model simulated changes in the lake's water volume under various scenarios. These included diverting water from incoming rivers, cutting agricultural water use by 40.0%, releasing dam water in non-agricultural seasons, treated wastewater utilization, and inter-basin transfers. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was utilized to analyze the simulation results. Expert opinions with AHP analysis, acted as a multi-criteria decision-making tool to evaluate the simulation and determine the optimal water supply source priority for the Urmia Lake. Our findings underscore the critical importance of reducing agricultural water consumption as the foremost step in preserving the lake. Following this, inter-basin water transfers are suggested, with a detailed consideration of the inherent challenges and limitations faced by the source watersheds. It is imperative to conduct assessments on the impacts of these transfers on the downstream users and the potential environmental risks, advocating for a diplomatic and cooperative approach with adjacent country. This study also aims to forecast the volumes of water that can be transferred under different climatic conditions-drought, normal, and wet years-to inform strategic water management planning for the Urmia Lake. According to our projection, implementing the strategic scenarios outlined could significantly augment the lake's level and volume, potentially by 3.57x109-9.38x109 m3 over the coming 10 a and 3.57x109-10.70x109 m3 in the subsequent 15 a.

This shellfish has become a pest in coastal and estuary waters in Southeast Asia. This study is the first report on the presence and structure of the M. sallei population in Indonesia, precisely in the coastal lakes of Medan City, North Sumatra Province. This research was conducted in Lake Siombak, Medan City, North Sumatra, which is one of the tropical tidal lakes in Indonesia. Mytilopsis sallei shellfish samples were taken for a year from September 2018-August 2019. Mytilopsis sallei were obtained using a Petersen Grab with a mouth opening of 30 x 30 cm. The measurement of M. sallei consisted of the shell length, shell width, shell thickness, and body weight. The analysis of the population structure parameters with ELEFAN I was accommodated in the FiSAT II software. Spatially, M. sallei highest density in Siombak Lake is at station 5 with 24,100 and 23,948 ind.m-2 and the lowest at station 7 is only 967 ind.m-2. Monthly, M. sallei hase the highest density in the dry season (Feb-Jul) compared to the wet season (Aug-Jan). The density of M. sallei in the dry season reaches 1213-13,187 ind.m-2 and in wet seasons reaches 369- 3,029 ind.m-2. The Mytilopsis sallei in Siombak Lake has a maximum length of 42.14 mm and the smallest size is 3.00 mm. The growth model of M. sallei in Lake Siombak is Lt = 42.14 (1-e-1.1(t-0.1598)). Mytilopsis sallei recruitment took place in January (fifth month). The instantaneous mortality rate (Z) of M. sallei mussels was 5.32 with an exploitation rate (E) of 0.66.

Movement and Growth of Translocated Coastrange Sculpin and Prickly Sculpin in Two Urban Lake Washington Tributaries, Washington	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Urbanization and other forms of land conversion have led to dramatic changes in freshwater ecosystems. We assessed the movement and growth of Coastrange Sculpin Cottus aleuticus and Prickly Sculpin C. asper, two species that are considered migratory based on their potamodromous and amphidromous life history strategies. We determined critical aspects of their ecology in two urban streams where they are rare or absent. Both species were collected near the stream mouth or in Lake Washington, implanted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, and translocated to an upper stream reach where their downstream movements and growth were monitored. Detections at stationary antennas indicated most downstream movements occurred from January to April, as has been observed in other Pacific Northwest systems. About 80% of the translocated sculpins remained in the study reach for at least 2 months before moving downstream and 10% remained more than a year. Smaller Prickly Sculpin generally remained in the study reach longer than larger Prickly Sculpin; however, no size effect was observed for Coastrange Sculpin. Most downstream movements occurred during low and moderate streamflow levels during each season for both streams; however, downstream movements occurred at relatively higher flows compared to the cumulative distribution of observed flows during most seasons. Both species appeared to grow well in the study streams; although, Prickly Sculpin growth rates were approximately double that of Coastrange Sculpin. Coastrange Sculpin often inhabit riffles where increased fine sediments and embeddedness from urbanization may impact them more than Prickly Sculpin, which typically inhabit pools. The overall survival and growth of both species in the two highly urbanized streams was better than expected. This study suggests that the lack of sculpins in some urban streams may be a result of stream barriers to movement rather than poor habitat conditions.

The aim of this study was to clarify the primary environmental factor that caused the disrupted seasonal cycle in population density of E. japonicus. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the disruption in their seasonal cycle was due to the impacts of water temperature, food conditions, and predator pressure, using an individual-based model (IBM). Based on the experimental data from the literature, we described the growth and reproduction of E. japonicus using temperature- and food-dependent functions. Previously, the developmental time of this species was expressed using B & ecaron;lehr & aacute;dek's equation. In this study, we applied the Kontodimas equation, which successfully reproduced the effects of food scarcity at higher temperatures. Additionally, the influence of predators was incorporated into the survival rate of adult individuals. The long-term data set of Lake Biwa was input into the developed model to simulate the population fluctuations during the disruption period (1975-1979) and stable period (1995-1999) of their seasonal cycle. The combination of environmental data to be input was (1) water temperature, food availability, and predators; (2) water temperature and food availability; and (3) water temperature and predators. Disruptions in the seasonal cycle of the population were only observed in scenario (1) during the disruption period simulation, suggesting that the disrupted seasonal cycle of this species in Lake Biwa may have been caused by the effects of both food condition and predators. The results of simulation scenarios (2) and (3) indicated that predators have a stronger impact on the population than food availability. This time, we used common and simple indicators to describe food conditions and predators, but the model can be improved to be more complex and accurate as more data become available. Such models are important tools for understanding the relationship between environmental factors and the dynamics of diaptomid copepod populations.

Diminished lake expanses, degradation of wetlands, and pollution in arid and semi-arid regions present threats to the structural and functional aspects of wetland ecosystems. This study employed plant functional traits to assess changes in the functional composition of plant communities in lakeshore wetland ecosystems in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Mongolian Plateau in northern China, as well as to explore the effects of climatic and soil heterogeneity gradients on wetland ecosystem function. Our findings reveal that all trait metrics can be categorized into three primary trait groups: plant nutrient traits, plant structural traits, and plant energy acquisition traits. Environmental heterogeneity drove variations in plant functional traits across different spatial scales. Soil and climatic factors combine to explain variation in wetland plant community characteristics and functional diversity, with soil moisture content as a key factor influencing functional diversity. In some lake lakeshore region habitats that were seasonally waterlogged for an extended period, seasonal precipitation might impact plant structural traits. The functioning of the ecosystem is predominantly shaped by community structural traits, functional diversity, and soil factors. This study extensively examines the interplay among the functional traits, functional structure, and ecosystem function within lakeshore plant communities. This exploration holds paramount significance in establishing a scientific foundation for the restoration and reconstruction of wetland ecosystem vegetation in the lakeshore regions.					xu, zhichao/HSF-9683-2023; Yu, Hongbo/B-5696-2009; Fang, Hai-Tao/J-1377-2019	Zhang, Rui/0009-0007-8352-393X; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2024	44	5							66	10.1007/s13157-024-01828-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-024-01828-1													WOS:001418190700002

Contamination of depressional wetlands in the Mpumalanga Lake District of South Africa near a global emission hotspot	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Mpumalanga Lake District (MLD) of South Africa hosts a regionally unique cluster of water bodies of great importance for wetland biodiversity. It is also located close to a global hotspot for coal-fired power station emissions but the local impacts from these sources of pollution are poorly understood. Sediment cores from three contrasting wetlands were Pb-210 dated and analysed for a range of contaminants linked to fossil fuel combustion, including trace elements, Hg, sulphur and spheroidal carbonaceous fly-ash particles (SCPs). At the two sites with pre-industrial (1900) baseline sediments, Pb, Zn and especially Cr concentrations and fluxes showed significant increases in the impact period (post-1975). Mercury showed the greatest proportional increase in flux (>4-fold) of all trace metals. Mercury and sulphur concentrations and fluxes showed highly significant correlations with emissions over the corresponding periods, while SCPs in sediments also closely tracked emissions. In a global context, levels of sediment contamination are relatively minor compared with other heavily industrialised regions, with only Cr exceeding the sediment Probable Effects Concentration for biological impact post-1975. Despite the relatively large increases in Hg, concentrations do not reach the Threshold Effects Concentration. The unexpectedly low levels of contamination may be due to i) low levels of many trace contaminants in South African coals compared to global averages, ii) prevailing recirculation patterns which transport pollution away from the study area during the wet season, minimising wet deposition, and iii) pollutant remobilisation through desiccation of wetlands or volatilization. The effects of hydrology and sediment accumulation rates lead to differential transport and preservation of organic-associated and more volatile contaminants (e.g. Hg, S) relative to non-volatile trace elements in wetlands of the MLD. The greatest fluxes of Hg and S are recorded in the site with the highest catchment: lake area ratio, lowest salinity and greatest sediment organic matter content.

Both hydraulic and thermal properties of the active layer, through which groundwater can flow during thawing seasons, are essential to quantify the groundwater flow system. However, there has been insufficient information on the Antarctic active layer. The goal of this study was to estimate the hydraulic and thermal properties of Antarctic soils through laboratory column experiments and inverse modeling. The column experiments were conducted with sediments collected from two lakes in the Barton Peninsula, Antarctica. A sand column was also operated for comparison. Inverse modeling using HydroGeoSphere (HGS) combined with Parameter ESTimation (PEST) was performed with data collected from the column experiments, including permeameter tests, saturation -drain tests, and freeze -thaw tests. Hydraulic parameters (i.e., K s , theta s , S wr , alpha , beta, and S s ) and thermal diffusivity ( D ) of the soils were derived from water retention curves and temperature curves with depth, respectively. The hydraulic properties of the Antarctic soil samples, estimated through inverse modeling, were 1.6 x 10 - 5 -3.4 x 10 -4 cm s -1 for K s , 0.37 -0.42 for theta s , 6.62 x 10 - 3 -1.05 x 10 -2 for S wr , 0.53 -0.58 cm - 1 for alpha, 5.75 -7.96 for beta, and 5.11 x 10 - 5 -9.02 x 10 -5 cm - 1 for S s . The thermal diffusivities for the soils were estimated to be 0.65-4.64 cm 2 min -1 . The soil hydraulic and thermal properties reflected the physical and ecological characteristics of their lake environments. The results of this study can provide a basis for groundwater -surface water interaction in polar regions, which is governed by variably -saturated flow and freezethaw processes.

Lithological data suggest the existence of a broad arid zone centered around 30 degrees N paleo-latitude, while a humid climate was supported by palaeobotanic assemblages in East Asia. Here, we report the occurrence of massive primary lacustrine dolomite and magnesite in the central East Asia during the middle Eocene. We provide a novel perspective from magnesium isotopes to link the formation of Mg-carbonates to seasonal dry-wet cycles. Rapid magnesium input during the rainy season and intense evaporation in the dry season likely caused the formation of magnesium carbonates in an enclosed lake. These findings provide insights into hydroclimatic seasonality during the Eocene, contributing to our understanding of the hydrological cycle response to a greenhouse climate. The Eocene epoch serves as a valuable analog for future climates. While geochemical reconstructions and model simulations have illuminated lower thermal latitudinal gradients and seasonal variations, our understanding of Eocene precipitation patterns lags, encompassing wet-dry conditions and seasonal dynamics. To enhance our understanding of Eocene precipitation patterns, we investigated a 158-m-thick primary dolomite and magnesite deposition in the middle Eocene lacustrine succession of the Lushi Basin, central China. From a novel perspective, we provide evidence from magnesium isotopes to link the formation of Mg-carbonates to climate seasonality. Clumped isotopes (triangle 47) and Mg isotopes provide evidence supporting the formation under specific hydroclimatic conditions. A surge in magnesium input during the rainy season, succeeded by intense evaporation in the dry season, likely led to the development of extensive Mg carbonate layers in an enclosed lake. The prevalence of seasonal variations in precipitation in the central East Asia during the middle Eocene is further substantiated by a compilation of the occurrence of Eocene lacustrine Mg-carbonates in this region. Our findings suggest that while Eocene temperature seasonal variability was weak, significant precipitation seasonality could have coexisted. Magnesium isotopes of Eocene lacustrine dolomites and magnesites provide insight into the presence of seasonal precipitation variation Mg-carbonate formation was linked to hydroclimatic seasonality characterized by alternation between heavy rainfall and strong evaporation Weak temperature seasonal variation and significant precipitation seasonality could have coexisted in central East Asia during the Eocene						Lu, Huayu/0000-0002-6306-6985; Guo, Yangrui/0000-0003-4638-8306; Zhu, Huaxi/0009-0008-6261-7643													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 28	2024	51	10							e2024GL108623	10.1029/2024GL108623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL108623													WOS:001217189000001

The spatial extent of Walleye and Lake Sturgeon spawning migrations below a dam in the lower Black Sturgeon River, Lake Superior	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the issue of barrier removal is complicated by the presence of non-native species below barriers. A fish tracking study was conducted to guide efforts for barrier remediation decisions for the restoration of fish populations with a focus on Walleye (Scander vitreus) and Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in the Black Sturgeon River, a river system fragmented by a dam which blocks access of fishes to the majority of a large, otherwise barrier-free watershed. Data from 3 years of spawning migrations (2018-2020) indicated that the Walleye population in Black Bay likely consists of both river (65%) and lake spawners (27%), with the remaining individuals spawning in the bay or river in different years. Walleye and Lake Sturgeon showed consistent differences in the extent to which individuals migrated upstream in the river during the spawning season, despite expectations that both species would spawn at the base of the dam when prevented from further migration. The dam was presumably a barrier to migration for Lake Sturgeon, as nearly all Lake Sturgeon that entered the river migrated to the base of the dam. In contrast, few Walleye entering the river during the spawning season migrated to the dam annually. These findings suggest that Walleye and Lake Sturgeon may not benefit equally, at least in the short term, from barrier remediation or dam removal.					; Dunlop, Erin/HGA-8508-2022; Pratt, Thomas/LTC-9063-2024; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Rennie, Michael/0000-0001-7533-4759; Pratt, Thomas/0009-0003-3648-2144													0906-6691	1600-0633				OCT	2024	33	4								10.1111/eff.12792	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12792		MAY 2024											WOS:001231882100001

Utilizing Sentinel-2 imagery, we investigated the spatial-temporal patterns of the Trophic State Index (TSI) in Hanoi's West Lake over a 2-year period. Our study proposed a robust TSI estimation model, incorporating three band ratios: R-rs(655)/R-rs(490), Rrs(705)/R-rs(655), R-rs(655)/R-rs(443), along with 124 in situ point data. The model exhibited high accuracy (the determination coefficient, R-2 = 0.63) and minimal errors (the root mean square errors, RMSE = 1.1 and 0.9). Consequently, West Lake consistently registered as hypereutrophic (TSI > 70), with seasonal variations linked to climate factors, leading to algal blooms and reduced water clarity. Spatial analysis highlighted the influence of sewage drains on TSI, indicating an urgent need for wastewater control. Our study demonstrates the cost-effective utility of Sentinel-2 imagery for monitoring urban lake eutrophication and emphasizes the urgency of managing eutrophication in these vital ecosystems.

Understanding the comprehensive impact of hydrologic processes and geochemistry on dissolved carbon in shallow groundwater also is a fundamental prerequisite for estimating the carbon budget of lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. This study investigated the spatial-temporal characteristics of the hydrologic process, geochemistry and dissolved carbon in shallow groundwater by the stable isotope tracer method, Piper diagram and Boomerang envelope model. The driving factors of dissolved carbon in shallow groundwater were explored by correlation analysis and redundancy analysis. The results showed low dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations during the thawing period and rainy season and high DIC concentrations and low DOC concentrations during the freezing period. The seepage velocity, soil carbon dioxide dissolution and gypsum dissolution were the main factors influencing DIC concentrations during the thawing period. The mineralization and decomposition of DOC and dissolution of carbonate rocks were the main factors influencing DIC concentrations during the freezing period. The concentrations of DOC were mainly controlled by the adsorption of Ca2+ and Mg2+, microbial activity and pollutants produced by human activities. Our results are useful for ecological sustainable development, human health, and research on the carbon transport in groundwater in the Tibetan Plateau.

Long-chain plant wax n-alkane hydrogen isotopic evidence for increased Little Ice Age aridity in the midcontinental United States	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We compare hydrogen isotopic measurements of long-chain leaf-wax n-alkanes (delta H-2(w); C-27, C-29, and C-31) from Martin Lake, Indiana, USA, with a calcite-based reconstruction of the oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation (delta O-18(p)) from the same lake. We observe stable and high delta H-2(w) during the Common Era (last 2000 years), which we interpret as growing-season precipitation originating mainly from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic. During the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1200-1850 CE), delta H-2(w) values increased by 3-8 parts per thousand, concomitant with a significant decrease in delta O-18(p) values by up to 12.5 parts per thousand. Multiple proxy records for this time indicate persistent growing-season drought. We interpret these relatively high delta H-2(w) values, as compared to the delta O-18(p) values, as a signal of low relative humidity that resulted in an H-2 enrichment in plant source water resulting in high delta H-2 values through enhanced plant water and/or soil evaporation. These results support the occurrence of low humidity conditions during the LIA in the midcontinental USA that also contributed to the marked decline of regional pre-Columbian Mississippian populations.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2024	72	3					273	282		10.1007/s10933-024-00325-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-024-00325-z		MAY 2024											WOS:001216106600001

The effects of intensive trapping on invasive round goby densities	PLOS ONE												The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is an invasive benthic fish first introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes in 1990 that has negatively impacted native fishes through increased competition for food and habitat, aggressive interactions, and egg predation. While complete eradication of the round goby is currently not possible, intensive trapping in designated areas during spawning seasons could potentially protect critical native fish spawning habitats. Baited minnow traps were spaced 10 meters apart in shallow water along a 100-meter stretch of shoreline within the Duluth-Superior Harbor during the round goby breeding period (June to October) with captured round gobies removed from interior traps (N = 10) every 48 hours. These traps were bracketed by two pairs of reference traps deployed weekly for 48 hours, from which round gobies were also tagged and released. The number of round gobies captured in the interior traps declined by 67% compared to reference traps over the course of the study, with extended periods of no captures. The tagged round gobies showed high site affinity, with 82.8% of tagged fish recaptured at the previous release site. The results indicate that even at open water sites, which allow natural migration of round gobies into the area, extensive trapping could reduce local population numbers.

Bacterial Quality Assessment of Lake Nasser Sediments During the Drought and Flooding Seasons	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												I N EGYPT, Lake Nasser is an important water resource. So, this study was concerned with evaluating the quality of the lake via determination of bacterial load in sediment samples collected from fifteen sites along the lake, and ten sites of Dahmit and Tushka Khors before and after flooding in the years 2016 and 2019. Results indicated that the highest bacterial density was recorded during drought season and lowest in flooding seasons of both years. Statistically, the highest bacterial load was recorded in the middle stream compared to the other two sides. The northern part of Lake Nasser recorded higher bacterial density in 2019, while the southern part recorded higher bacterial density in 2016. Salmonella spp . were detected in about 56% of Lake Nasser samples in 2016, compared to 33% in 2019. Also, year 2016 recorded higher bacterial densities than in 2019, this may be due to the difference in flood strength, lake level, and sedimentation capacity from year to another. Finally, it is important to constantly monitor the quality of Lake Nasser to avoid any alteration of its natural characteristics .																			0375-9237	2357-0350				MAY	2024	64	2					655	671		10.21608/ejbo.2024.217755.2382	http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/ejbo.2024.217755.2382													WOS:001222829500009

Calculation of Kinetic Fractionation of Open-Water Evaporation Over an Upland Reservoir	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE												Based on the fact that many water reservoirs built in headwater catchments receive no water input during dry season, we modified the Craig-Gordon model and proposed an approach to calculate kinetic fractionation factors in open-water evaporation taking into account isotopic compositions of precipitation and of lake water, lake volume, and land-based meteorological data. The approach is centered around the determination of lake water isotope enrichment rate over time during dry periods. We then applied this approach for calculating kinetic fractionation factors, turbulence index, and open-water evaporation for a small reservoir located in a sub-tropical monsoonal climate. We found that the kinetic fractionation factors, epsilon K,H and epsilon K,O are, respectively 3.11 parts per thousand +/- 0.41 parts per thousand and 2.50 parts per thousand +/- 2.15 parts per thousand, corresponding to the turbulence index of 0.43 +/- 0.19. Evaporation rates in open-water estimated by our approach is 1.55 times of the land-based evaporation gauged in the nearby meteorological station. Wind speed, represented by turbulence index, is proved as an important climatic factor influencing kinetic fractionation. This study confirms that wind and surface area factors, which have been neglected in several isotope mass balance models, should be included into calculation process. Isotopes are forms of the same element that differ in atomic mass. Water molecules (H2O) have lighter isotopes of H (1H, 16O) and heavier isotopes (2H, 18O). The evaporation of water favors the evaporation of the lighter isotope molecules over heavier isotope, via a process called fractionation. Well defined fractionation factors help determine precisely the degree of water loss that can be expected in an open water system due to evaporation. Such an accurate determination of seasonal evaporation loss would in turn help water managers better understand water resource management, especially in a drought prone area. Today, climate change has increased the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Many people in the world now live under water stress conditions. Therefore, a precise determination of evaporation loss in open-water bodies is necessary to increase population resilience to climate change. This study proposes a straight forward approach to determine kinetic fractionation factors (the others are equilibrium fractionation factors) in a desiccating lake during the dry season and apply them to a sub-tropical reservoir in Viet Nam. The kinetic fractionation factors are found to be highly dependent on wind speed variability while evaporation loss is more dependent on temperature and humidity. A modified Craig-Gordon model was developed to calculate the kinetic fractionation factor of water isotopic compositions in upland reservoir Kinetic fractionation is significantly influenced by wind condition for an upland reservoir in sub-tropical monsoon climate Open-water evaporation rate is re-evaluated as 1.55 times of the land-based monitoring data					Trinh, Duc/ABF-7253-2021; Vu, Tuong-Thuy/AAC-6492-2020; Nguyen, Dinh-Tuan/Q-7712-2019	Vu, Tuong Thuy/0000-0002-6656-8016; Thu Nga, Do/0000-0001-7045-1753; Trinh, Duc/0000-0003-4207-8845														2333-5084				MAY	2024	11	5							e2023EA003140	10.1029/2023EA003140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023EA003140													WOS:001217898900001

Synoptic Conditions and Lake-to-Lake Connections for Days with Lake Effect on All of the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												An investigation of lake effect (LE) and the associated synoptic environment is presented for days when all fi ve lakes in the Great Lakes (GL) region had LE bands [ fi ve -lake days (5LDs)]. The study utilized an expanded database of observed LE clouds over the GL during 25 cold seasons (October - March) from 1997/98 to 2021/22. LE bands occurred on 2870 days (64% of all cold-season days). Nearly a third of all LE bands occurred during 5LDs, although 5LDs consisted of just 17.1% of LE days. A majority of 5LDs (56.5%) had lake -to -lake (L2L) bands, and these days comprised 43.5% of all L2L occurrences. 5LDs occurred with a mean of 26.1 (SD = 6.2) days per cold season until 2008/09 and then decreased to a mean of 13.8 (SD = 5.5) days during subsequent cold seasons. January and February had the largest number of consecutive LE days in the GL with a mean of 5.7 and 5.4 days, respectively. As the number of consecutive LE days increases, both the number of 5LDs and the occurrence of consecutive 5LD increase. This translates to an increased potential of heavy snowfall impacts in multiple, localized areas of the GL for extended time periods. The mean composite synoptic pattern of 5LDs exhibited characteristics consistent with lake-aggregate disturbances and showed similarity to synoptic patterns favorable for LE over one or two of the GL found by previous studies. The results demonstrate that several additional areas of the GL are often experiencing LE bands when a localized area has active LE bands occurring.

These samples were randomly taken from five rivers and analyzed by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. We found seasonal fluctuations in the hierarchy of mean concentration for different heavy metals in five rivers' fish, water, and sediments. In the water, the concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn, Ni, and Hg ranged from 0.010-0.081, 0.0165.531, 0.013-2.445, 0.860-22.924, 0.043-1.424, 0.015-0.933, 0.091-1.451, 0.012-2.888, and 0.010-0.032 mg/l where in the sediment the concentrations ranged from 0.1-1.47, 4.21-284.1, 0.12-28.46, 1860-14971.33, 122.1-480.8, 0.84-42.15, 2.14-210.35, 15.3-30.4, and 0.17-10.44 mg/kg. For fishes concentrations ranging from BDL-0.78, 0.04-86.45, 0.01-1.67, 4.19-102, 0.080.94, 0.01-0.99, 0.08-9.56, 0.01-4.56, and BDL-0.2 mg/kg were reported for the above metals order respectively. The highest concentration (mean) of Cr and Fe in waters and sediments was 1023 times and 13020.72 % higher than WHO's standard and Toxicity Reference Values (TRV), respectively. Besides, the bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of the selected elements for the studied fishes were found to be between 0.036-626.25, where the pollution load index (PLI) for the five rivers ranged from 0-0.95 and the concentration factor (CF) found between 0.02-4.03. Estimated daily Intake (EDI) as well as Target hazard quotients (THQs) analyses revealed potential risks for fish consumers, particularly the level of some metals exceeding the WHO/FAO's tolerable limit, which indicates that the rivers' water and fish are dangerous to humankind.

Relationship of the "Dequada" Phenomenon with Mercury Methylation in Pantanal, Brazil	WATER												The illegal activity of gold mining in the Brazilian Pantanal is contaminating the aquatic ecosystem with mercury. This contamination has been potentiated by mercury methylation due to a typical natural phenomenon of the Pantanal ecosystem known as "dequada". The present study estimated in the laboratory the temporal production of methylmercury at two timepoints: the beginning of a flood, when the "dequada" phenomenon occurs, and the dry season without such phenomenon. After collecting water and sediment, experiments were performed with microcosms to reproduce conditions close to nature. To monitor the concentration of methylmercury, 1.0 mg L-1 of Hg2+ was added to water and sediment experiments in the Castelo and Saracura bays, both during the "dequada" and without it; monitoring lasted for 25 days. The methylmercury concentration was analyzed using atomic fluorescence spectrometry, total organic carbon using TOC 5000A, and physical and chemical parameters such as pH, redox potential, and dissolved oxygen with a multi-parameter probe. The results led to the conclusion that the "dequada" phenomenon significantly affected mercury methylation, because the environmental changes caused by this phenomenon such as the increased concentration of organic matter, decreased dissolved oxygen, and decreased pH, potentiated mercury methylation. During the "dequada" in the Castelo bay, the methylation rate was 3.5 times higher (6297.56 ng L-1) than in the experiment without the "dequada" (1827.44 ng L-1). Therefore, the gold mining activity in Pantanal can cause great damage to the ecosystem because this environment favors mercury methylation, making its most toxic form active in the aquatic ecosystem of Pantanal.

We developed a mobile platform for CH4 eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements to tackle this gap. The mobile system was deployed at nine lakes across a latitudinal transect in the Alps and validated by comparing the measured fluxes with fixed on-shore EC station and to chamber and boundary layer flux estimates. Our approach was shown to be well suited to capture different CH4 emission pathways and to integrate the within lake variability, therefore, overcoming the limitations of other methods (e.g., boundary layer method). Additionally, this mobile system offers a tool to characterize inter-lake variability of fluxes with consistent measurements. Methane fluxes were explained by dissolved nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, seston and lake size. The highest fluxes and most substantial seasonal variability were found in a shallow low-altitude lake in the Southern Alps. We suggest that characterizing the intra-lake emission heterogeneity and consistent measurements for a better understanding of inter-lake emission differences is fundamental for a solid estimate of freshwater CH(4)budgets.

Taking Dongting Lake, a large-scale lake connected to the Yangtze River, as an example, this study employed wavelet analysis and multiple models to explore the temporal characteristics of water area, level, and flow and the water level-area and flow-area correlations from 2000 to 2021 on annual, seasonal, and monthly scales. The results show that the interannual variations in annual, seasonal, and monthly water area anomalies demonstrated rather consistent overall trends, but there were differences in the variation ranges at different temporal scales. The dominant amplitudes for annual and seasonal area anomalies were close, while for monthly anomalies, they were sometimes much larger. The dominant amplitudes of the water level and flow anomalies generally followed the order annual < seasonal < monthly. The water level-area and flow-area correlations are strongest at Chenglingji station and on the seasonal scale. This study provides a multiscale perspective on hydrological conditions and will support the management of water resources and the prevention of drought and flood disasters.

Disentangling determinants of nearshore fish and crayfish assemblages in a canyon-shaped Mediterranean reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The distinct origin and hydrological characteristics of reservoirs, shaped by fluctuating water levels and seasonal variations, play a crucial role in determining aquatic species assemblages across diverse limnological zones. This study aimed to analyze fish and crayfish assemblages in the nearshore area of a canyon-shaped Mediterranean reservoir, seeking to identify seasonal and spatial convergent patterns and infer the factors influencing them. Samplings were conducted at five stations along the longitudinal profile of the reservoir at depths around 7 m using gillnets and hoops nets. A seasonal pattern emerged regarding species abundance and biomass, with higher values recorded during the warmer period. Additionally, a spatial trend was observed, indicating higher species abundance in the middle part of the reservoir and lower abundance near the dam, particularly during the colder period. Water transparency, temperature, and the distance from the dam were identified as the most significant factors affecting species assemblages in terms of abundance and biomass. This research provides valuable insights into the intricate interplay between environmental factors, seasonal changes, and the assemblages of aquatic species in a Mediterranean reservoir, contributing to our understanding of its ecological dynamics.					; Bobori, Dimitra/AAH-1625-2019	Perivolioti, Triantafyllia Maria/0000-0002-8639-9766; Laggis or Lagki, Anastasia/0000-0002-8566-808X													0378-1909	1573-5133				MAY	2024	107	5					551	565		10.1007/s10641-024-01550-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-024-01550-1		APR 2024											WOS:001229992900001

Mercuric chloride (HgCl2) has been widely used to preserve water samples prior to gas analysis. However, alternates are needed because of the environmental impacts and regulation of mercury. HgCl2 is a weak acid and interferes with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Hence, we tested the effect of HgCl2 and two substitutes (copper (II) chloride - CuCl2 and silver nitrate - AgNO3), as well as storage time (24 h to 3 months) on the determination of dissolved gases in low ionic strength and high DOC lake water. Furthermore, we investigated and predicted the effect of HgCl2 on CO2 concentrations in periodic samples from another lake experiencing pH variations (5.4-7.3) related to in situ photosynthesis. Samples fixed with inhibitors generally showed negligible O-2 consumption. However, effective preservation of dissolved CO2, CH4 and N2O for up to three months prior to dissolved gas analysis, was only achieved with AgNO3. In contrast, HgCl2 and CuCl2 caused an initial increase in CO2 and N2O followed by a decrease. The CO2 overestimation, caused by HgCl2-acidification and shift in the carbonate equilibrium, can be calculated from predictions of chemical speciation. Errors due to CO2 overestimation in HgCl2-preserved water, sampled from low ionic strength and high DOC freshwater, could lead to an overestimation of the CO2 diffusion efflux by a factor of >20 over a month, or a factor of 2 over the ice-free season. The use of HgCl2and CuCl(2 )for fresh-water preservation should therefore be discontinued. Further testing of AgNO(3 )preservation should be performed under alarge range of freshwater chemical conditions.

The trophic status was assessed using 24 parameters developed from a literature review, and water samples were collected from four observation stations. Data were analyzed using field measurements and laboratory analyses. The results showed that dissolved oxygen ranged between 2.6-9.1 mg/l in June 2019 and 3.4-7.7 mg/l during the March 2021 measurement period, salinity (33.6-34.4 ppt and 31-34 ppt), turbidity (0.77-6.33 FNU and 1.2-3.42 FNU), water clarity (4.18-11.92 m and 4.44-8.44 m), Biological Oxygen Demand (10.5-26 mg/l and 1-17 mg/l), Chemical Oxygen Demand (3.68-11 mg/l and 15.5-46.5 mg/l), chlorophyll-a (0.11-0.24 mg/l and 0-0.56 mg/l), Total Dissolved Solids (20,400-22200 mg/l and 21,300-53400 mg/l), ammonia (0.038-0.178 mg/l and 0.01-0.3 mg/l), nitrate (0.02-0.706 mg/l and 0.01-0.03 mg/l), orthophosphate (0.014-0.174 mg/l and 0.04-1.59 mg/l, and culturable bacteria (0-1.74 center dot 105 CFU/mL and 0-1.61 center dot 108 CFU/mL). Pegametan Bay exhibited a significant decrease in water quality between June 2019 and March 2021, with mesotrophic and eutrophic trophic states. The parameters determining changes in the trophic state of Pegametan Bay were orthophosphate, TSS, organic content, E. coli, Salmonella, and Vibrio. This trophic state assessment can be used for early detection, monitoring, water quality control, and eutrophication control, thereby ensuring sustainable aquaculture activities and optimal marine resource production.

Exploitation and survival of Yellow Perch introduced into community ponds	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Increased urbanization paired with stagnant or decreasing fishing license sales has bolstered the importance of community fishing programs. Community fisheries require fish introductions, have highly variable chemical and physical characteristics, and are situated in urban settings with non-traditional fishers that can prefer unique species. Community ponds also often receive high angling pressure and exploitation that can hinder the establishment of sustainable populations. We evaluated angler exploitation and its effects as well as biotic (i.e., stocking density, predator relative abundance) and abiotic (i.e., water temperature, pond size, pond depth) factors affecting survival of stocked adult Yellow Perch Perca flavescens in community ponds. We tagged 580 adult Yellow Perch (>= 150 mm) and stocked them into four community ponds at 74 or 148 fish/ha in September 2018. We collected two years of fishery dependent (angler tag reporting) and independent recapture data to estimate angler exploitation and survival of Yellow Perch using a joint live-recapture and dead-recovery model. We estimated anglers harvested 44% (95% CI +/- 6%) of stocked Yellow Perch across the four ponds in two years, with the majority (81%) coming from one pond. Additionally, anglers harvested 66% of captured Yellow Perch and harvest probability increased with fish size. Seasonal exploitation ranged from 0% to 37% and was more prevalent in cold water seasons. Yellow Perch survival was negatively related to harvest ( beta = -0.14; 95% CI = -0.17 to -0.10) and a quadratic effect of water temperature (temperature: beta = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.02 - 0.53; temperature 2 : beta = 0.01; 95% CI = - 0.01 - 0.01). Yellow Perch survival was not related to stocking density or pond characteristics. After two years, cumulative survival in three ponds ranged from 0.83 to 0.87 whereas survival in one pond with high exploitation was 0.22. Our results suggest Yellow Perch can be successfully introduced in community fisheries, but populations may not be sustainable when harvest is high. Thus, management strategies to mitigate excessive harvest or multiple put-and-take stockings may be necessary to maintain Yellow Perch populations in community fishing programs.

The peculiarity of the system derives principally from the interaction of the lakes with a sea of relatively low salinity. In contrast to our best understanding of the state of biological knowledge, the abiotic parameters of coastal lakes along the southern Baltic Sea have never previously been so comprehensively supplemented. The database consists of physicochemical properties of 13 coastal lakes based on the analytical assessment of 419 water samples collected seasonally between 2014 and 2019. Water properties were analyzed according to the connection of the lakes to the Baltic Sea using a total of 23 predictors. The lakes were classified as closed, intermittently connected, or open. Based on the physicochemical data, a relationship between the hydrological connection between the lakes and the sea was determined. The data collected could be used to monitor ongoing global climate change at the biosphere level.					; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019	Matela, Mikolaj/0000-0001-5839-512X; Obolewski, Krystian/0000-0001-9361-0286; GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353														2052-4463				APR 6	2024	11	1							345	10.1038/s41597-024-03195-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03195-2								38582793					WOS:001198408200001

Environmental DNA Characterization of the Fish Species Composition in the Mukawa River and Adjacent Habitats	FISHES												The diverse freshwater fish fauna of the Japanese archipelago is distributed among four main island landmasses, which include Hokkaido in the north, with many diadromous species. One relatively well-preserved river drainage along the southern coast of Central Hokkaido is the Mukawa River. Fish fauna surveys in the Mukawa River were mostly in downstream areas and the fish diversity is not well-documented among the upper, lower river, and coastal environments. Fish communities in the river, estuary, and sea were sampled using eDNA analysis to evaluate upstream and downstream species detections, and tidal and spatial detection variation near the river mouth. The number of species was higher at the river mouth and nearshore sites compared to the river and offshore. Fish detections reflected life history categories (freshwater resident, diadromous, brackish, or marine) and the environments. Similarity analysis showed that fish species compositions were divided into (1) upstream and midstream, (2) downstream and river mouth, (3) adjacent shore, and (4) offshore. Salmonid, cyprinid, loach, and sculpin species were detected in the river, compared to a mixture of species downstream and along the coast. This rapid assessment type study demonstrated that eDNA survey methodology would be effective for multiple river comparative surveys, seasonality studies, or evaluating possible effects of cross-river weirs or dams.

In the global aspect, geographical zonation had the greatest reliable significance in the microbial community biogeography, while depth had the lowest.

The population genetic structure of YFP in the Poyang Lake Basin is relatively simple, with a linkage disequilibrium decay distance of 705 bp. The correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance for YFP populations from different regions showed that the populations had a fixed range. Although Poyang Lake is connected during the rainy season, changes in water levels and human activities have hindered the exchange and migration of YFP populations between different areas. In particular, these changes may lead to differences in physiological metabolism and reproduction between populations in the main lake area and those in the sand pits, which are connected to the main lake area during the dry season. This study highlights the need for measures such as artificial translocation, dredging and habitat restoration to improve the exchange of YFP populations between different areas. We also suggest that the sand pits should be designated as protected areas, as their environment is conducive to the survival of the population.						rao, rongcheng/0000-0001-5340-8921													1052-7613	1099-0755				APR	2024	34	4							e4145	10.1002/aqc.4145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.4145													WOS:001199796100001

One of the communities affected are benthic invertebrates, that perform important functions such as nutrient cycling and energy transfer in reservoirs. We investigated the influence of the following factors: spatial, abiotic variables, reservoir characteristics and land use on the richness, biomass and composition of benthic invertebrates in 29 reservoirs in southern Brazil. Sediment samples and abiotic variables were collected in the littoral and profundal zones of reservoirs during the dry (July) and rainy (November) seasons in 2001. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrices to obtain the spatial factors. We analysed the unique and overall effects of the four factors. We found that the factors analysed significantly influenced the composition and biomass of the invertebrates (22%). The percentage of variation explained by the unique effects of the different factors showed similar values, but the spatial factors showed the highest value (4%). This indicates that closer reservoirs have higher similarities in terms of composition and biomass of benthic invertebrates. On the other hand, the abiotic variables had the highest explained value when evaluating the overall effects (10%). Therefore, for invertebrate richness, only the reservoir characteristics were significant for the overall and unique effects (49%). More specifically, we observed lower taxon richness in older reservoirs, probably because the age of such artificial aquatic ecosystems influences other variables, which structure the benthic communities. In conclusion, the structure of benthic invertebrate communities in reservoirs of southern Brazil are mainly driven by spatial and reservoir characteristics.					; Higuti, Janet/A-7492-2017; Petsch, Danielle/I-7592-2015; Petsch, Danielle/ABE-1084-2021	Higuti, Janet/0000-0002-3721-9562; Moretto, Yara/0000-0002-1201-8502; Rosa, Jonathan/0000-0002-2407-6240; Petsch, Danielle/0000-0003-4515-8285; Martens, Koen/0000-0001-8680-973X													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2024	86	2							61	10.1007/s00027-024-01064-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01064-z													WOS:001204808100001

Zooplankton diversity studies in the region have been primarily conducted in Peru and Colombia, with limited research in the Ecuadorian Amazon. To address this gap, our research aimed to enhance taxonomic knowledge and understand zooplankton diversity patterns in the Napo and Pastaza lower basins at different spatial and temporal scales. Two sampling expeditions were conducted in the high waters of 2021 and rising waters of 2022. Dry conditions in 2021 led to lower-than-expected water levels. The study identified 107 zooplankton species, revealing variations in richness and composition between years, lakes, and depth strata. Grande Lake, deeper and wider than Delfincocha, exhibited significant turnover variations across strata in both seasons. Despite a relative longitudinal homogenization between channels and floodplains during high waters, beta diversity across vertical and temporal gradients highlighted complex dynamic zooplankton communities in both lakes. In addition, we include the first records of 44 taxa for the Ecuadorian Amazon and 36 for Ecuador. These findings emphasize the need for targeted research and conservation efforts in the face of escalating environmental threats to the Western Amazon.					; Díaz, Gabriela/X-3433-2019; Cuesta, Francisco/AEP-2719-2022	Sanchez, Fernando/0000-0002-8775-773X; Echevarria, Gabriela/0000-0001-9353-6696; Cuesta, Francisco/0000-0002-5150-073X; 														2073-4441				APR	2024	16	8							1166	10.3390/w16081166	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16081166													WOS:001221403300001

However, little has so far been done to properly reveal the pathogenic endowments of DEC in these populations.Aims and Objectives:We evaluated 4 DEC strains among children under 5 years.Materials and Methods:A cross-sectional study design was employed among 384 positive cases.Results:There was a significant decline in infections associated with DEC as the children grew older (chi 2[12] = 87.366: P = [0.000]. A total of 56 (14.6%) cases were 0-12 months, 168 (43.8%) were 13-24 months, 88 (22.9%) were 25-36 months, 40 (10.4%) were 37-48 months, and 32 (8.3%) were 49-60 months. A total of 248 (64.6%) male subjects exhibited more susceptibility to DEC infections than their female counterparts (n = 136 [35.4%]) (chi 2[3] =13.313: P = [0.004].

The ancient inhabitants could easily rely on the nutrients and fats derived from fishes abundant in the diverse aquatic biomes of its rivers, lakes, marshes and the gulf. Specifically, fats held significant value in ancient societies, and, besides its nutritional benefit, fish can also provide oil as a useful fatty substance. However, archaeo(zoo)logical data are uninformative as far as fish oil is concerned, while written documents detail its usage and supply but remain silent on its production methods. This contribution aims at presenting, comparing and combining the available evidence from modern data, the archaeological remains and Early Bronze Age written sources on the local ichthyofauna, focusing on the strategies adopted to optimize the exploitation of its fat.

J	Chen, YF; Dong, YR; Sun, YX; He, C				Chen, Yanfei; Dong, Yuru; Sun, Yongxi; He, Chao			Typical lake area is accurately predicted and assessed based on deep learning algorithms and associated physical mechanisms	EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS												Accurate quantification of lake areas is pivotal for understanding regional hydrological cycles and conserving wetlands. Existing methodologies, including remote sensing interpretations and conventional deep learning approaches, face inherent limitations. Addressing this, the present study introduces an innovative deep learning model for lake area prediction, incorporating physical mechanisms. Initially, the study extracts the monthly areas of East Dongting Lake over 2000 to 2020, utilizing the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Subsequently, it integrates water level data from Chenglingji, developing a response relationship between area and water level. This process enhances the loss function of the traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, leading to the creation of a physically informed Area and Water Level-LSTM model (AWL-LSTM). This model is then assessed in comparison to its traditional LSTM counterpart.The findings reveal a pronounced shrinking trend in the water area of East Dongting Lake over the past two decades, characterized by significant seasonal fluctuations. In periods of rising, high, and receding water levels, the lake's area exhibits a robust correlation with the Chenglingji water levels. However, this correlation weakens during low water periods. The AWL-LSTM model outperforms the conventional LSTM in several aspects, including extensibility, precision, interpretability, and stability. It demonstrates superior accuracy in peak data series fitting, evidenced by a 34% and 28% improvement in the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSE) and significant reductions in the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 77% and 80%, respectively. By integrating the characteristics of the "dry, rising, abundant, and receding" periods under the constraint of physical relationships, the model's correction effect depends on the correlation of these physical relationships. A higher correlation translates to greater model interpretability. The AWL-LSTM model offers valuable technological support for scientifically forecasting lake areas and managing water resources efficiently.

Especially during the spawning season, the fluctuating water flow process is particularly important for fish reproduction. A bi-objective optimization model considering both the environmental flow demand for fish spawning and the stability of hydropower output is established in this study and solved by one of the most widely used algorithms for multi-objective problems, the Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm-II. The derived Pareto Front can be used to guide reservoir operation during fish spawning seasons. The model proposed in this paper is applied to the Yangqu Reservoir, currently under construction on the upper Yellow River in China. The results show that the stability of hydropower output can still be improved by 4.80% to 10.56%, even if the environmental flow demand is taken into account. Even for the scheme preferring ecological recovery, the stability of hydropower output can be increased by more than 0.85%. Fish spawning demand and hydropower stability are considered simultaneously. Derived Pareto Front can be used for reservoir operation in fish spawning seasons. Room still exists for improving hydropower stability meeting ecological demands.

Food webs in isolation: The food-web structure of a freshwater reservoir with armoured shores in a former coastal bay area	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many shallow coastal bays have been closed off from the sea to mitigate the risk of flooding, resulting in coastal reservoir lakes with artificial armoured shorelines. Often these enclosed ecosystems show a persistent decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services, which is likely reflected in their food-web structure. We therefore hypothesize that the food webs of coastal reservoir lakes with armoured shorelines (1) consist of relatively few species with a low food-web connectance and short food chains, and (2) are mainly fuelled by autochthonous organic matter produced in the pelagic zone. To investigate these two hypotheses, we used stable-isotope analysis to determine the food-web structure of lake Markermeer (The Netherlands), a large reservoir lake with armoured shorelines in a former coastal bay area. Contrary to expectation, connectance of the food web in lake Markermeer was comparable to other lakes, while food-chain length was in the higher range. However, the trophic links revealed that numerous macroinvertebrates and fish species in this constructed lake exhibited omnivorous feeding behaviour. Furthermore, in line with our second hypothesis, primary consumers heavily relied on pelagically derived organic matter, while benthic primary production exerted only a minor and seasonal influence on higher trophic levels. Stable -isotope values and the C:N ratio of sediment organic matter in the lake also aligned more closely with phytoplankton than with benthic primary producers. Moreover, terrestrial subsidies of organic matter were virtually absent in lake Markermeer. These findings support the notion that isolation of the lake through shore armouring and the lack of littoral habitats in combination with persistent resuspension of sediments have affected the food web. We argue that restoration initiatives should prioritize the establishment of land -water transition zones, thereby enhancing habitat diversity, benthic primary production, and the inflow of external organic matter while preserving pelagic primary production.

J	Bui, TD				Bui, Thuyet D.			Using remotely sensed data in Google Earth Engine to investigate water surface temperature at shrimp farms in the climate change context: a case study at Mong Cai City, Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL												Global warming and extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves and droughts) have caused widespread adverse impacts across regions and sectors, including shrimp farming. However, the availability of in situ water temperature data typically only represents a small portion of shrimp farms' thermal profiles, and this often leads to limitations in investigating the impacts of global warming and climate change on shrimp farming. For this aim, satellite-derived water surface temperature (WST) at shrimp farms in Mong Cai City, Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam, was investigated by using Landsat data in the Google Earth Engine. Results showed that satellite-derived WST at shrimp farms in Mong Cai City ranged from 11.5 degrees C to 37.6 degrees C in 2000-2003, mainly concentrated at 15-35 degrees C (around 95% retrieved WST from Landsat data). There was a seasonal variation of WST at shrimp farms, with monthly mean WST ranged from 18.4 degrees C (January) to 29.9 degrees C (July). The mean annual WST at shrimp farms in Mong Cai City showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2022. A remarkable warming trend of WST was detected during the shrimp-growing season (from April to October), and this may lead to a high risk for shrimp health. The findings of this study indicated that greater awareness of water temperature monitoring at shrimp farms is required if this activity is to be sustainable in the climate change context.					; Bui, Thuyet/P-8457-2019	Bui, Thuyet/0000-0001-5390-356X; 													0967-6120	1573-143X				OCT	2024	32	5					6273	6286		10.1007/s10499-024-01465-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-024-01465-9		MAR 2024											WOS:001187481500001

Central Vietnam, located near the centre of this transitional region, has encountered numerous effects. As a result, its sediments from lakes or speleothems are valuable archives for interpreting past climate variability. However, there is still a lack of high-resolution paleoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic reconstructions during the Holocene in Vietnam. Our study presents a paleoenvironmental diatom-based record of sediment cores collected from Bien Ho maar lake (14 degrees 03'N, 108 degrees 00'E) in the Central Highlands of Vietnam covering nearly the entire Holocene. Based on changes in diatom assemblages in the sediment sequence, we identified two periods of the Early Holocene (similar to 11,700-7800 cal BP) and the Mid- to Late-Holocene (similar to 7800-360 cal BP), which mark a remarkable shift in the environment around Bien Ho. Alternations of key diatom species during the Early Holocene indicate intensity variations between water-mixing and thermal stratification mechanisms in meso-eutrophic conditions. During the Mid- to Late-Holocene, the complete dominance of Aulacoseira granulata var. granulata implies year-round destratification and intense mixing of the lake water column in a permanently eutrophic environment. Its morphological variability reveals intervals of dry environmental conditions driven by pronounced droughts across the Asian continent.

Counteracting effects of "hook avoidance" and "hook habituation" on angler catch rates in a catch-and-release fishery	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Catch-and-release (C&R) angling is often used to maintain high catch rates but fish vulnerability to capture may decrease following hooking, thereby decreasing angler catch per unit effort (CPUE) (hyperdepletion). To determine if fish post-capture response affected recapture probability and population-level CPUE, individual capture histories of Largemouth Bass in two lakes were compared before and after doubling angling effort in a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) analysis. Previous capture and day-of-season both affected recapture probability. Counteracting effects of previous capture and reduced late-season catch rates caused no hyperdepletion of angler CPUE. Our results highlight the complexity of fish behavioral responses to angling and suggest that hyperdepletion of angling catch rates may not be an issue in C&R fisheries.

J	Long, JP; Halfman, JD; Hawley, N				Long, James P.; Halfman, John D.; Hawley, Nathan			Internal wave resonance, surges, and strong nonlinear damping differentiated in two elongated lakes with the aid of an original Green's function	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												While the analogy between the wind-pumped internal seiche in a lake and the driven damped-harmonic oscillator is recognized, use of a damped-oscillator model to understand internal-wave behavior is seldom attempted due to the irregular waveforms arising from variable winds, and to the presence of nonlinear waves like surges. Using a new variable-frequency Green's function derived for a damped oscillator within the context of the two-layer model of a stratified basin, we examine internal wave behaviors in Seneca and Owasco Lakes, two elongated lakes in New York state with very different lengths and depths. Our approach reproduces the measured undulations of the lowest horizonal-mode internal-seiche with surprising fidelity. It also yields the seiche's seasonal variation of frequency, primarily due to changes in the stratification intensity and thermocline depth. Notably, our model also estimates the seiche amplitude decay-time, a key quantity difficult to obtain for a constantly agitated seiche. The decay time matches the computed surge-formation time, which limits seiche lifetimes to as little as one seiche period. Surges also strongly affect the undulating internal-wave waveforms in a manner consistent with tank experiments. Finally, we find that the internal seiche in Owasco Lake exhibits a uniquely well-defined resonance with the diel wind pattern, and, for Seneca Lake, that surges propagate bidirectionally, augmenting an oft-cited report of surges traveling only in one direction.

Data from surveys conducted in 1998 and 2020 targeting 120 stations covering a surface area of 9647.97 km2 was used. Trawling speed of Research Vessel Ndunduma was restricted to 4.6 km/hr. Length frequency distribution was modelled with the probability density function for determining the likelihoods in the gamma distribution. Parameters for modal length and logistic modelling were guessed and Solver in Microsoft Excel 2021 was used to generate the best of fit values through iteration with GRG Nonlinear approach. The study determined fish diversity using the Shannon and Weiner relationship. The recent survey recorded fewer fish species (149) against 158 sampled in the previous survey. The overall catch rates in 2020 and 1998 ranged from 3.8 kg/0.5 h to 2003.8 kg/0.5 h and 28.7 kg/0.5 to 1,884.3 kg/0.5 h, respectively. Overall fish density in the 2020 and 1998 surveys was calculated at 11.7 tons/km2 and 7.5 tons/km2, respectively representing a 35.6% drop. The study has revealed temporal and spatial shifts in the fish stock composition, distribution and abundance which necessitates urgent management interventions to prevent further fisheries resource losses.

J	Reeder, A; Rader, E; Bishop, J				Reeder, Adrianne; Rader, Erika; Bishop, Janice			Glass, crystallinity, and VNIR reflectance from vent to margin at Jordan Craters, OR USA	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												We present an in-situ analysis of the reflectance of Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) and the petrologic texture of the surface of a relatively young lava flow at Jordan Craters, OR. Jordan Craters is a small young basaltic lava field in Oregon, USA which terminates in a lake, providing a wide variety of petrographic textures related to cooling rates and prolonged seasonal exposure to water, post-emplacement. Field VNIR measurements of 191 in-situ spots were used to calculate the overall reflectance between the bands 500-1000 nm (R500-1000) which serves as a proxy for glass abundance. Analyses were conducted on the surfaces of lava, spatter, and scoria from the vent, mid-portion, and margin of the flow. We assigned the 15 collected hand samples to five cooling environments based on their location and modal mineralogy. Crystal content was measured microscopically and compared with the spectra classification for 15 hand samples. Slower cooling environments had more crystals (30-60%) of plagioclase, olivine, Fe-oxides, and devitrified glass (15-30%) whereas faster cooling environments have higher proportions of vitreous glass (similar to 70%). In order from slowest cooling to fastest cooling the groups were lava interior, oxidized vent, flow margin, glassy vent, and mid-flow surface. Mid-flow indicates surfaces where inflation or breakouts of the top flows occurred at least five meters from the margin. Additionally, locations that were exposed to prolonged heat or environmental water had higher proportions of devitrification and Fe-oxide crystals. The values of R500-1000 mirrored the cooling histories of the hand samples with interior analyses having the highest values and vent samples having the lowest, though there was much scatter in the vent category due to lumping of oxidized and glassy together in the in-situ dataset. Our findings indicate that VNIR may be used to identify variations in petrologic texture across basaltic lava flows due to eruptive and emplacement conditions such as vent vs mid-flow surface or quickly cooled vs slowly cooled with careful sampling and sufficient number of analyses. This has implications for understanding the cooling dynamics of lava flow surfaces as well as furthering the study of lava flows as paleoenvironmental indicators.																			0377-0273	1872-6097				MAR	2024	447								108035	10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2024.108035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2024.108035		FEB 2024											WOS:001207014500001

Common bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) shift littoral zooplankton community composition to smaller bodied taxa	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												We investigated the effects of native common bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) and non-native western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) on zooplankton assemblages in an outdoor mesocosm experiment. Twenty-one 100 L mesocosms containing zooplankton were assigned either four G. cotidianus, four G. affinis, or were left as a control group (i.e. with no fish) and monitored for 14 days. Zooplankton community composition in the fish treatments was significantly different from the control tanks by day 14, but did not differ from one another. Both G. cotidianus and G. affinis reduced crustacean abundances, including Bosmina meridionalis, Daphnia pulex and Mesocyclops australiensis, relative to the controls. This reduced the effects of predation, competition, and physical interference by the crustaceans on rotifers, allowing rotifers to reach numerical dominance in the fish treatments. In contrast, zooplankton assemblages in the control mesocosms became dominated by cladocerans, indicating that these had a competitive advantage in the absence of the zooplanktivorous fish species. Our results suggest that G. cotidianus and G. affinis have similar preferences for zooplankton taxa and that G. affinis can alter littoral zooplankton assemblages in a comparable manner to G. cotidianus.

Interaction between surface waters and the Quaternary shallow alluvial aquifer of Lake Maga downstream: influence of ponds, streams, irrigation canals, and geological features (Far North, Cameroon)	GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL												The valorization of Lake Maga for agricultural purposes has not only contributed to the socio-economic development of the study area, but has also modified the surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) flow regimes. Understanding the interaction between the SW and the shallow Quaternary aquifer, under land use change and soil structure modification, is still a challenge, especially in the semi-arid area. In this study, GW level, hydrogeochemical characterization, and geological features are used to understand, locally, the influence of Lake Maga, its associated hydraulic components, and the other SW bodies on the GW behaviour. GW levels were measured in 51 wells in December 2012 and monitored in February 2013, and in 15 wells (beyond the 51) in June 2017 and December 2018. Physicochemical parameters of SWs and GWs were measured in the field, and 15 water samples were collected for major ion characterization. The GW levels were close (mean value (sic)5 m) to the land surface, with zero to very low (< 1 m) water level fluctuations near SW bodies. The GW levels (< 2 m) are influenced more by their proximity to irrigation canals, ponds, and streams than Lake Maga (mean (sic)3.5 m). The analysis of electrical conductivity (EC) values and GW levels showed that the weakly mineralized (< 200 mu S.cm(-1)) GW were associated with the shallower GW table level. The moderate GW mineralization (200 < EC < 700 mu S.cm(-1)) were more influenced by the geological texture of the shallow aquifer. The analysis of the geological characteristics of the sub-shallow aquifer structure in the locality of Pouss is mainly sandy, while in the localities of Maga and Guirvidig, clay, clayey-sand and sandy-clay materials dominate. There are no trends in GW chemical evolution from Lake Maga waters towards the shallow groundwater table (SGWT). The mixing-ratios values showed that the SW contributed for more than 65% (mean) to the sub-shallow aquifer in the study area, and the highest SWs (80%) contribution occurred in the locality of Pouss, close to Lake Maga, pond, Logone River, irrigation canal, and seasonal stream, associated with the shallowest GW levels (< 1.5 m). The proximity to SW bodies and the texture of the fluvio-lacustrine deposit of the shallow aquifer strongly influenced GW table levels and their hydrogeochemical characteristics. This work could be a prerequisite to understand how the physicochemical and chemical properties of GW in the shallow aquifer evolve and respond under the influence of SW bodies.

J	Dutta, S				Dutta, Snigdhodeb			Assessment of the age and growth of three fin fish species from a tropical estuary (Cochin, west coast of India)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Data on three fin fish species were collected from the Cochin estuary (part of the Vembanad-Kol wetland system, India) from January 2018 to December 2019. The present study presents the first comprehensive results on fisheries demographics within this estuary, based on length-frequency data, to calculate vital demographic dynamic factors and estimate the stock of the commercially important three fin fish species. A variety of evaluations were conducted using the FiSAT II program. Caranx heberi had an asymptotic length (L) of 304.5 mm and a growth constant (K) of 1.1 year-1, while Etroplus suratensis had an asymptotic length (L) of 158.55 mm as well as a growth constant (K) of 1.1 year-1. For all the species studied, the age at zero-length (t0) had been calculated and varied from -0.04 to -0.14. Oreochromis mossambicus had longevity (tmax) of 4.76 yr and a growth performance index (phi) of 4.51, whereas E. suratensis had 2.72 and 4.44. E. suratensis had overall mortality (Z), natural mortality (M), and fishing mortality (F) of 2.93, 1.2 and 1.73 year-1, respectively, while C. heberi had 1.42, 1, and 0.42 year-1. The present exploitation level is greater than the optimum exploitation rate, according to the relative yield per recruit (Y/R) study, indicating over-exploitation of two examined finfish species and moderate exploitation for one species. Management measures such as mesh size limitations, restricted fishing efforts, and the proclamation of restricted seasons are required to save these species from extinction. This work provides the first information about the stock status of three fin fishes (Caranxheberi, Etroplussuratensis, and Oreochromis mossambicus) from this estuary. According to prior research, this estuary has seen a species reduction over time. It is vital to first learn about the stock status of the studied species because it is one of the most fished finfish species in this estuary. This study's findings will help formulate sustainable resource management.																				2823-1465				FEB 6	2024	60								1	10.1051/limn/2023012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2023012													WOS:001157040500001

Sulfur Signature of a Mediterranean Wetland: The Case of Soils of the Inundated Floodplain Area at the Tablas de Daimiel National Park	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												In the Mediterranean region, numerous wetlands co-exist with competitive agricultural systems. Although wetlands' hydrology (in water volume, source, and residence time terms) plays a major factor in their ecosystem structure, many of these wetlands have been subjected to different degradation processes. One such case is the Tablas de Daimiel National Park (TDNP), which witnesses one of its most environmentally sensitive times. In this context, scarce information is available on the sulfur (S) contents in this wetland. To diagnose this wetland's degradation status, 43 soil samples were selected and analyzed to investigate S contents in the surface soils (0 to 30 cm) of the inundated floodplain area of the TDNP. They represent different degrees of exposure to pollutants and exposure to flooding. Sulfur determination was carried out by X-ray fluorescence. The S contents in the area range between 1.85 and 37.15 g kg-1, with a mean value of 13.71 g kg-1, which implies marked variability throughout this wetland. The highest values were observed near the wetland entrance via the Giguela River, while the lowest ones appeared at its exit, with a relatively uniform gradient from the entrance to the exit. The relatively high S concentrations observed at sites other than the wetland entrance can be probably related to the continuous non-point source contamination with P, N, and S fertilizer applications, via runoff agricultural production systems. The results of this study are essential for understanding and predicting total S variability within the TDNP (Spain), which can interfere with soil management practices.

However, estimations of nematode biomass turnover and secondary production have been poorly defined for decades and it is difficult to reach a consensus about the importance of nematodes for ecosystem functioning. Here we monitored monthly the nematode species composition, abundance and biomass over 3-10 years in a set of artificial urban ponds, and we used different allometric models to estimate biomass turnover and secondary production. During the first 3 years of colonisation of the pond bottom, the nematode community was rather species -poor and mostly composed of small bacterivorous species (Monhysterids); however, the community quickly reached impressive numbers (up to 21 million individuals m-2) achieving a maximum annual production of 3.8-11.6 gC m-2 year-1 depending on the allometric model used for estimation. However, over the long-term (3-10 years), abundance and community structure eventually became dramatically altered by anoxic events occurring in one pond, dampening nematode production to low levels (0.3-0.6 gC m-2 year-1) without clear resilience. The comparison of models helped us to formulate general recommendations in order to popularise the use of nematode secondary production as a useful ecosystem diagnostic tool. Overall, results indicated that under good conditions of oxygenation nematodes are a highly productive component of the zoobenthos of ponds. We also discussed the consequences of this finding for sustainable pond aquaculture, as nematodes constitute an important local and nutritive resource for juveniles of economically important fish, such as carp and tilapia.					; Traunspurger, Walter/KGL-7190-2024; Majdi, Nabil/J-8578-2016	Gansfort, Birgit/0000-0003-0384-0710; Majdi, Nabil/0000-0001-7052-4297													1388-5545					FEB	2024	26	3					319	339		10.1163/15685411-bja10311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685411-bja10311													WOS:001204344800005

Geodetic imaging and dynamic monitoring of the spatiotemporal evolution process of saline soil are vital to detect the potential geological hazards in a vast area. Therefore, this paper presents a coupled deformation model synthesizing environmental factors and trigonometric function model for estimating the time-series InSAR deformation and interpreting the dynamic evolutionary mechanism of the saline mudflat. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model, the sulphate saline mudflat is selected as the study area, which is traversed by the Tehran-Isfahan high-speed railway in Howz-e-Soltan Salt Lake, Qom, Iran. Moreover, 259 interconnecting interferograms were selected for the time-series InSAR estimation, composed of 87 Sentinel-1A images obtained from October 2014 through December 2018. Then, the time-series deformations, including the annual deformation velocity and the accumulated deformation, are extracted by the original estimation, polynomial, trigonometric and environmental models. The comparison results show that the environmental model's RMSEs (root-mean-square errors) are smaller than others. It should be noted that the linear deformation, periodic oscillation, and deformation derived from the environmental factors (i.e., precipitation and temperature) are extracted by the environmental model. Furthermore, the dynamic evolutionary mechanism of the saline mudflat is interpreted according to the physicochemical properties of sulphate/carbonate saline soil. The results derived from the environmental model suggested that the saline-soil deformation is directly related with the environmental changes: rapid collapsibility occurs when the precipitation increases from September to the next May, while uplift due to the salt swelling in the dry and rainless season from May to September every year. Our findings provide an opportunity to detect, prevent and control the potential geological hazards in saline mudflats.

Increased methane emission associated with anthropogenic activities in a highly urbanized tropical reservoir	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Pollution in reservoirs affects the water quality, ecosystem services, and CH4 emissions. High temperatures and eutrophic conditions in a tropical urban reservoir can potentially increase CH4 fluxes. To investigate the interference of pollution on CH4 fluxes in Guarapiranga, a highly urbanized tropical reservoir (Brazil), four sampling stations (G1 to G4) with different degrees of pollution were evaluated. The sampling campaigns occurred from May (2018) to March (2019), considering spatio-temporal dimensions and water and sediment characteristics. Chemical analysis for these compartments were carried out followed by statistical analyzes and Random Forest modeling to understand the relationship between water and sediment characteristics on CH4 fluxes and to rank the most important predictors for CH4. Statistical analysis showed differences on CH4 fluxes (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.01), except between May and August (p < 0.05). The highest CH4 fluxes were observed during March (G3 = 722.0 mg m(-2) d(-1), and G2 = 439.2 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen, both in the water and sediment, showed anthropogenic impact in all stations. The Random Forest model pointed temperature, pH and DOC as the main predictors of CH4 fluxes in Guarapiranga reservoir. We observed an increase on CH4 fluxes in warmer waters (above 29 C-degrees) during March and with pH close to 7.0. This is the first study that quantified and associated CH4 fluxes in the Guarapiranga reservoir with limnological variables in the most populous region in South America. Our results provide an advance on main factors which governs CH4 fluxes in tropical urban reservoirs.

J	Lima, SAD; Andrade, HA; Sousa, RGC				Lima, Severino Adriano de Oliveira; Andrade, Humber Agrelli; Sousa, Raniere Garcez Costa			Effects of hydrological and spatial seasonality on taxonomic and functional diversity of fish assemblages in an Amazonian floodplain lake	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The floodplain lakes of the Amazon constitute one of the most important aquatic systems in terms of fish biodiversity. These ecosystems are influenced by the flood pulse, which in turn, affects the behaviour of fish communities within this lake ecosystem. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the facets of taxonomic and functional diversity may be influenced by the conditions of 'patches' of internal habitats, considering the margins and central environments of a floodplain lake in the Amazon. Lake Cujubim, located on the right bank of the Madeira River, was evaluated via fisheries carried out in the high-water and low-water phases, during the day and night, and considering two location strata. The results suggest that the absence of significant differences in alpha taxonomic diversity between the two phases may be a possible seasonal mischaracterisation in Lake Cujubim attributed mainly to dam constructions along the Madeira River. Apparently, no major differences occur in the assembly of fish in terms of their taxonomic and functional characteristics, regardless of luminosity. In the strata of the locations, demonstrates noticeable habitat patches, with the margins being bioregions with high incidences of individuals of the Engraulidae family, confirmed by both taxonomic and functional diversity (alpha and beta). It can be seen that, even in connected lakes, there are differentiated metacommunities between the bioregions, thus forming patches of habitat, and that the shores of the lake, especially those located in proximity or distant from the river, are more suitable areas for food and refuge.					; Andrade, Humber/KGL-7227-2024	Garcez Costa Sousa, Raniere/0000-0002-5620-389X; Oliveira Lima, Severino Adriano/0000-0001-6495-5453; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2024	33	3								10.1111/eff.12770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12770		JAN 2024											WOS:001142050500001

However, the lake's water environment is threatened by socioeconomic development and rapid population growth along the lake. This study analyzed the spatial scale effects and seasonal dependence of land use types and landscape metrics on water quality in 16 sub-basins along northeastern Lake Tanganyika at different levels of urbanization. The results revealed that land use types had a higher influence on water quality in urban areas than that in rural areas; the explanatory variance in the urban area was 0.78-0.96, while it was 0.21-0.70 in the rural area. The explanatory ability of land use types on water quality was better at the buffer scale than at the sub-watershed scale, and the 500 m buffer scale had the highest explanatory ability in the urban area and rural area both in the rainy season and dry season, and artificial surface and arable land were the main contributing factors. And this phenomenon was more obvious in dry season than in rainy season. We identified that CONTAG was the key landscape metric in urban area and was positively correlated with nutrient variables, indicating that water quality degraded in less fragmented landscapes. The sub-watershed scale had the highest explained ability, while in rural area, the 1500 m buffer scale had the highest explained ability and IJI had the highest explanatory variance, which had a negative effect on water quality. Research on the relationship between land use and water quality would help assess the water quality in the unmonitored watershed as monitoring is expensive and time-consuming in low-income area. This knowledge would provide guideline to watershed managers and policymakers to prioritize the future land use development within Lake Tanganyika basin.

Spatial and temporal dynamics of near-bottom dissolved oxygen in the central basin of Lake Erie	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Eutrophication continues in Lake Erie and low oxygen concentration remains a concern in the central basin of the lake. Summertime dissolved oxygen concentrations can be hypoxic (low dissolved oxygen) and anoxic (dissolved oxygen < 1 mg l(-1)) in the hypolimnion. We examined the spatial and temporal patterns of hypoxia in the central basin along a similar to 26 km west-east station transect in the western portion of the central basin (depth gradient from 11.4 m in the west to 20 m in the east). Water column properties were monitored using moored instruments (dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, Chlorophyll a fluorescence) and instrument profiling during cruises in 2008 and 2009. Hypoxia was examined using a biologically relevant value of 40% dissolved oxygen saturation (i.e. similar to 4 mg l(-1)) and 25% dissolved oxygen saturation (i.e. similar to 2.5 mg l(-1)) as used by government agencies. Our goals were to determine the onset and location of hypoxia, as well as the frequency of hypoxic events. We observed differences in the spatial and temporal patterns between the two years, related potentially to different water levels, stronger winds, and a smaller hypolimnion and lower thermocline depth in 2009. Near-bottom hypoxia occurred in the east at the end of June and extended westward by the end of July 2008 using 40% saturation; in early July to mid-August using 25% saturation. The onset of hypoxia (40% sat) occurred earlier in the west in 2009 but was similar to 2008 using 25% saturation. Hypoxia was not static, rather there were a total of similar to 100 events of both levels of hypoxia, which were of different duration, noted across the transect in both years. Both the frequency and duration of hypoxic events (> 1 min) were higher and longer in 2008, perhaps related to water circulation and the resuspension of bottom sediment by synoptic-scale storms, which coincided with low oxygen events. Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of hypoxia provides insight into their effects on habitat quality as well as biogeochemical processes in benthic and hypolimnetic environments in Lake Erie.																			1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-MAR	2024	27	1					5	18		10.14321/aehm.027.01.05	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.027.01.05													WOS:001326942900002

However, with the limitations of traditional monitoring methods, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) cannot comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal water quality patterns in the lake. With the development of remote sensing methods, this study aimed to describe the spatial and temporal variability of turbidity in Lake Buhi in 2020 using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) applied to Sentinel-2 images. GWR provided accurate estimates of turbidity, with the results achieving an R-2 value of 0.98 for the February image and 0.93 for October. GWR-derived turbidity was used as an alternative to in situ data and then regressed with NDTI values to acquire turbidity models for dry and wet seasons. Upon validation, the best turbidity model for the dry (R-2 = 0.59, RMSE=0.60, MAE=0.15) and wet (R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 1.22, MAE = 0.25) seasons produced acceptable results, hence, used to assess the spatial and temporal variability of turbidity in the lake throughout 2020. The analysis revealed that Lake Buhi is more turbid during the dry season than the wet season. Turbidity during the dry season is governed by its natural water flow, while it is heavily influenced by precipitation during the wet season.																			1682-1750	2194-9034					2024							29	36		10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W9-2024-29-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W9-2024-29-2024													WOS:001234953400005

We obtained higher species richness than previous reports from similar habitats, with 2552 individuals recorded from 94 species of 43 families. Of these, 75.53% and 24.47% were terrestrial birds and waterbirds, respectively. Seven resident taxa are listed as "Near Threatened" or "Vulnerable" according to the 2016-2022 IUCN Red List. The families of Ardeidae and Nectariniidae were most abundant with eight and six species, respectively. The planting and land preparation stages accommodated more diverse and even bird communities in the paddy fields of southwestern Sarawak. Our findings suggest that temporary land-use changes do not necessarily alter paddy field bird diversity and assemblages. Small-patch paddy fields should not be overlooked because they offer additional foraging niches for water-dependent birds and opportunistic feeders, as well as serving as a refuge for migratory waterbirds and vulnerable residents considering their habitat heterogeneity and microhabitat transitions between paddy stages.

The likelihood of sampling American eelgrass and starry stonewort in Cayuga Lake varied by date, depth, and location	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Understanding the phenology of aquatic, invasive species is important from theoretical and management perspectives, particularly if phenology differs among or within waterbodies in the invaded range. Variability in the likelihood of sampling invasive starry stonewort [ Nitellopsis obtusa (Desv.) J. Groves] and American eelgrass ( Vallisneria americana Michx.) in Cayuga Lake, New York, was evaluated with respect to date, geographical location, and water depth. Following point -intercept methodology, 25,741 samples were collected at 22 sites among 3 locations (northern, middle, southern) from 2020 through 2022. Based on logistic regression, the likelihood of sampling both species followed quadratic relationships with increasing date and water depth. Relationships differed among locations and between species, but variability was notably greater for starry stonewort. American eelgrass was most likely to be sampled at 2.5 m of water compared to 3.5 m for starry stonewort. The likelihood of sampling American eelgrass increased from June through August, peaked in September, and declined through November and was similar among locations. Overall, the likelihood of sampling starry stonewort increased from June to peak near the end of July and was very low by November. Among locations, the date of peak likelihood of sampling starry stonewort differed by 42 d. If sampling likelihoods are positively correlated with biomass phenology, large variability in the likelihood of sampling starry stonewort due to water depth and date among locations reflects an inability to generalize the phenology of this species in Cayuga Lake. Reported regional differences in phenology further highlight challenges in generalizing this aspect of starry stonewort life history.																			0146-6623					JAN	2024	62						30	37		10.57257/JAPM-D-23-00015	http://dx.doi.org/10.57257/JAPM-D-23-00015													WOS:001247507100005

In the current study, we identified a male pheromone in lake char (Salvelinus namaycush) to evaluate the hypothesis that it exploits a non-sexual preference for juvenile odour. In anadromous char species, the odour of stream-resident juveniles guides migratory adults into spawning streams. Lake char are also attracted to juvenile odour but have lost the anadromous phenotype and spawn on nearshore reefs, where juvenile odour does not persist long enough to act as a cue for spawning site selection by adults. Previous behavioural data raised the possibility that males release a pheromone that includes components of juvenile odour. Using metabolomics, we found that the most abundant molecule released by males was also released by juveniles but not females. Tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to identify the molecule as taurocholic acid (TCA), which was previously implicated as a component of juvenile odour. Additional chemical analyses revealed that males release TCA at high rates via their urine during the spawning season. Finally, picomolar concentrations of TCA attracted pre-spawning and spawning females but not males. Taken together, our results indicate that male lake char release TCA as a mating pheromone and support the hypothesis that the pheromone is a partial match of juvenile odour.

Environmental factors influencing biomass and bulbil production of Nitellopsis obtusa in Lake Koronis, Stearns County, Minnesota	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Starry stonewort [ Nitellopsis obtusa (Desvaux) J. Groves] is a green macroalga in the family Characeae that is native to Eurasia. In the United States it has invaded many waterbodies across the northern tier from New York to Minnesota. In Minnesota, starry stonewort often grows later into the growing (September to December) season than most native species; however, the environmental factors that influence this life history trait are not well understood. Starry stonewort was harvested every 3 wk from May to November in 2020 and 2021 from four locations in Lake Koronis, Stearns County, MN. Light, water pH, and water temperature were also collected to correlate these variables to starry stonewort growth. Rhizoid biomass had weak negative correlations with temperature ( r s = - 0.19) and pH ( r s = - 0.14). Bulbil biomass had weak negative correlations with temperature ( r s = - 0.24), pH ( r s = - 0.31), and light transmittance ( r s = - 0.11). Bulbil density had weak negative correlations with temperature ( r s = - 0.23), pH ( r s = - 0.29), and light transmittance ( r s = - 0.10). Bulbil production was highest between October and November of each year. Bulbil biomass and density was lower in 2020 (4.6 g m - 2 and 1,229 bulbils m - 2 ) than in 2021 (14.7 g m - 2 and 5,211 bulbils m - 2 ). The average annual bulbil density was 1,537 bulbils m - 2 and ranged from 0 to 157,000 bulbils m - 2 . The ability of starry stonewort to grow in dense mats and produce large quantities of bulbils contributes to the difficulty of controlling infestations. Bulbils are a method of spatial and temporal distribution that can allow for recolonization of previously treated areas.

The investigated sectors are of great importance, being essential key points related to the hydrological connectivity between the Danube River distributary branches and interdistributary channels, streams, and lakes of the Danube Delta. Thereby, six stations were selected to provide seasonal water quality data, collected biannually, from 2018 to 2023, in different hydrodynamic conditions (high and low waters). To assess the conditions of the investigated surface waters, several physical in-situ measurements (T, pH, DO, EC, TDS, Transp.) were taken at all sampling locations. Additionally, water samples were collected for laboratory analysis (N-NH4+, N-NO2-, N-NO3-, P-PO43-, Chla, SiO2, TOC, SO42-, Turb., TSS, ORP). The criteria used to assess the water quality in the investigated sites include the current Romanian national legislation (Ord. 161/2006) and other international environmental standards. Most of the investigated physical-chemical parameters were in line with correlated criteria, and only incidentally, the objectives were exceeded at single or multiple locations. According to this assessment, permanent monitoring of water quality is mandatory at these important hydrological nodes, by analyzing the status and trends in physical and chemical characteristics of the surface water environment.

Fish attractors when resources abound: prevalence of juveniles and lack of assemblage structure in a field experiment in the Amazon floodplain	BIOTA NEOTROPICA												Floating structures, both natural and artificial, attract fish by providing shelter, feeding areas, and nesting sites. Occupancy can be either more permanent, leading to a gradual gathering of the assembly, or transient, occurring randomly. The ability of an attractor to hold a fish assemblage may depend on the availability of habitat resources in the environment. New artificial attractors are more valuable when natural ones are scarce. Additionally, fish characteristics play a role; young and small fishes may need new habitat for shelter more than adult fish. As aquatic herbaceous areas are abundant during high water, coinciding with the period of fish reproduction, they are particularly relevant for juveniles. We constructed fish attractors composed of natural materials to investigate the structure of fish assemblages during the flood of an Amazonian floodplain lake. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that assembly processes during the flood period would be random, with a predominance of juveniles in the attractors. We collected fish at intervals of 5, 15, and 30 days, resulting in 39 observations, and classified them as either adult or juvenile. Species composition was compared among treatments using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). The assembly process was tested through species co-occurrence patterns employing null models and the C-score index. The proportion of juveniles and adults was compared using a Chi-square test. Species composition remained consistent throughout the experiment. The assembly was random, with a prevalence of juveniles, possibly serving only as temporary shelter and feeding areas. Our study contributes to understanding the role of habitat availability for floodplain fishes during high waters. The results suggest that floating attractors and new habitats may be more valuable for the juveniles than adult fish and can be used as a management strategy for population recovery, especially when floating herbaceous habitats are scarce.

To determine this, the geology, structural geology, hydrogeology, and hydrogeochemistry of the area in the north of the G & uuml;l & scedil;ehir-Ye & scedil;il & ouml;z sub-basin of the K & imath;z & imath;l & imath;rmak Basin were investigated. For hydrogeological studies, 19 water samples were collected in May and September. Tectonically, this area has a horst-graben structure. The relationships between the water analysis values of the study area and the tectonic areas were investigated. In particular, the lithium content of the waters in the study area was investigated. Hydrogeochemical properties and seasonal changes in water resources were studied in detail, and their relationship with tectonic areas was evaluated. Water analyses were carried out during wet and dry periods to determine temporal hydrogeochemical changes. According to the analysis, the waters in the area are of Ca-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-HCO3 facies. In addition, there are water samples with high lithium content in the study area. IDW and Kernel diagrams of these were prepared. It was found that these high values were influenced by the rocks formed in the ancient sea and saline lake environments. The region with the highest lithium value is in the formations that represent the former salt lake environment. High lithium (Li) values are generally higher in the region within the K & imath;z & imath;l & imath;rmak graben. Lithium values in this area were determined as 241.3 mu g/L, 154.5 mu g/L, 155.2 mu g/L, 156.8 mu g/L, and 155.6 mu g/L.					; demircioglu, ramazan/AEV-7564-2022	demircioglu, ramazan/0000-0003-0616-0331; 													1335-1788						2024	29	2					367	383		10.46544/AMS.v29i2.11	http://dx.doi.org/10.46544/AMS.v29i2.11													WOS:001362055200011

Dynamics of Accumulative Coast under the Influence of Transverse Hydraulic Structure	PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												Purpose. . The study is purposed at determining modern dynamics of the Lake Sasyk bay-bar (Crimean Peninsula) and the impact of the local seawater intake upon the coastal zone based on long-term in situ observations, satellite data and mathematical modeling. The study was conducted in view of the proposed construction of transverse hydraulic structures. Methods and Results. . Regular (2007-2014) and occasional in situ observations of the coastline dynamics at the Lake Sasyk bay-bar were used. The maximum inter-annual oscillations in the coastline locations are shown to be 5.8 m in the sections to the southeast from the transverse structure (seawater intake) and 3.4-7.2 m - in the sections to the northwest. Seasonal variability is significantly higher: the maximum range is 14.6 m in the sections to the southeast, and in those to the northwest - 26.7 m. The wave climate was investigated. The wave reanalysis data for 1979-2022 have shown that the southwestern direction of waves approaching the coast with a frequency exceeding 30% is most probable. The highest waves also come from this direction. The extreme values of wave characteristics which can occur once in n years were obtained. The mean long-term values of storm numbers in the area under study are given depending on their duration. Application of the GenCade integrated lithodynamic model permitted to obtain the estimates of changes in the coastline position in this area on the interannual scales. Conclusions. . The model calculations made it possible to reproduce the main features and trends in changes of the beach width in the area of the structure obtained due to in situ observations. The mean annual sediment flows in the area under study are directed clockwise (to the southeast) that is conditioned by the coastline orientation and the wave climate features. Difference between the mean annual sediment rates at the area boundaries is negligible - less than 4% of the multi-year average. This fact indicates insignificant impact of the structure upon the sediment total transfer to the southeast.

J	Guseva, MA; Krylova, VY				Guseva, Maria Andreevna; Krylova, Viktoriia Yurevna			Trends in the elements of the carbonate system of Lake Ladoga	VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES												During the observation period in 2003 - 2021, it was shown that the total concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon, represented in the water of Lake Ladoga mainly HCO3- and CO2 has been increasing in recent years. The concentration of CO2 has a sufficiently large spatial and temporal variability and, in terms of carbon at the stations under consideration, can range from 0.6 to 47 % of the total concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon, depending on the change in the ratio of production and destruction processes in different seasons at different horizons. At the same time, a significant interannual trend of an increase in the total concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide and, accordingly, a decrease in the hydrogen index was revealed. Calculation of the balance of dissolved in water and atmospheric CO2 showed that, in general, CO2 concentrations in water exceed equilibrium, however, at the peak of the growing season, the surface layer of the lake in some cases, on the contrary, can absorb carbon dioxide from the air. This effect of the << biological pump >> >> is most clearly manifested in the nutrient-rich and heated shallow part of the lake. However, in the main body of water, there is an interannual trend of increasing the calculated concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide relative to its equilibrium concentrations with the atmosphere. Due to the shortage of nutrients, primarily phosphorus, an increase in temperature does not lead to an increase in productivity and CO2 consumption. Stoichiometric ratios of apparent oxygen and carbon deficiency, in turn, demonstrate that the quantitative change in the content of dissolved carbon in water can be fully explained by oxidation or synthesis of organic matter in only a third of the cases considered. In the remaining 2/3 of cases, the increase in the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon may be associated with an increase in carbon runoff from the catchment area into Lake Ladoga, or with intra-reservoir processes associated with the peculiarities of accumulation and redistribution of CO2 in the water column.

It is the most stressed inland water body at the same time however, with competing and conflicting water-users, and continued environmental degradation from anthropogenic-based stressors. The use of the lake as a source of raw water for domestic supply have become more significant and critical over the past recent years with the aggravating condition of water scarcity in Metro Manila. It also serves as an important flood-detention storage for Metro Manila during the rainy season, with flow diversions from upstream Marikina river basin. This study presents a three-dimensional hydrodynamic study of Laguna Lake to understand the physical processes that govern and influence lake hydraulics for various water uses. A hydrodynamic model was set-up incorporating spatial and temporal variations in wind forcing and watershed river discharges, and dynamic sea interaction. Simulation results reveal a significant increase in lake salinity concentration for incremental increases in lake water abstraction, particularly during the dry season. A numerical experiment on bathymetric evolution also showed various Pasig River hydraulic discharge features and an increase in hydraulic residence time of the lake. Modelling analysis on the lake's flood detention function on the other hand revealed different shore-land flood inundation areas and recession durations for varying lake-flood detention levels that warrants the need for a more comprehensive and sustainable flood management operation in the metropolis. Results from this study substantiate scientific information for outlining management approaches and conservation strategies especially for fast developing environments.																			2199-899X						2024	386						95	100		10.5194/piahs-386-95-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/piahs-386-95-2024													WOS:001481626500015

For this purpose, standard benthic and pelagic nets were used in the lake and a portable electroshock device was used in the streams. As a result of the sampling carried out in two different seasons, wet and dry periods, the presence of 26 species from 14 families was determined and the abundance values for many species were higher in the wet season. In terms of species diversity, the Leuciscidae family ranked first with 9 species, while the Gobiidae family was represented by 4 species, the Clupeidae family by 2 species and the remaining 11 families were represented by one species each. In terms of individual density, Rhodeus amarus was the most dominant fish in both lake and streams (78.1% lake; 28.3% stream). In the lake, Blicca bjoerkna, Clupeonella cultriventris, and Atherina boyeri were the most abundant species after R. amarus (7.2%, 3.2% and 3.2%, respectively). An important finding of the study was that there were almost no individuals of Silurus glanis, Esox lucius, and Cyprinus carpio (4, 8 and 1 individuals, respectively), which are species of high commercial value in the lake. In addition, the fact that Carassius gibelio, one of the invasive species reported in previous studies, was not found in the lake is very pleasing in terms of lake biodiversity. In addition, Leucaspius delineatus, caught in both seasons, was identified from the lake basin for the first time.

As specific objectives, the paper considered to spot the main potential sources of contamination and their environmental impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Equally, the purpose of the article is to emphasize the importance of monitoring the water quality of the Danube Delta, for preserving these unique natural water resources and their ecosystem services (fresh water, biodiversity, flood control, recreation, nutrient cycling, fishing and other traditional activities, ecotourism). Surface water samples collected from several control sections situated on the main tributaries and canals, as well as from lakes were investigated physically (To- C, EC- mu S/cm, TDS- mg/L, turbidity- NTU units, TSS- mg/L) and chemically (pH- units, DO- mg/L, N-NO2-- mg/L, N-NO3-- mg/L, P-PO43-- mg/L, Chla- mg/L, SiO2- mg/L, TOC- mg/L, SO 4 2-- mg/L, S 2-- mg/L, H2S- mg/L and synthetic detergents- mg/L). Generally, the hydro-physical- chemical characteristics and water quality assessment of the surface waters of the lakes manifest the combined effect of both processes occurred in the catchment (weathering, sediment supply and transport), as well as the in situ lake processes (photosynthesis, sediment mixing, biogeochemical cycling, evaporation, eutrophication, productivity changes). Overall, the physical and chemical characteristics of the sampling sites investigated at high waters of the Danube are quite similar to those measured at low waters. The differences that mainly occurred within the lakes are more related to the limnological variables and the local environmental conditions. Anyway, a significant seasonal variation was noticed in the lakes, during the dry period, when different physical and chemical characteristics appeared to be influenced by high air temperature, lack of precipitation, low water level regime, low dissolved oxygen level regime, all related to climate change effects etc. Moreover, the anthropogenic factor that left its mark on some physical-chemical characteristics of water should not be omitted either. However, the results obtained within this study did not show such alarming values as might have dangerous effects on the investigated aquatic environments. The water quality information within this case study may be used for improving the understanding of the water quality issues and to better coordinate and plan for future monitoring activities in and around the Danube Delta environment.

Using long-term (1955-2020) climate data from Alberta Climate Information Service, we estimated gross and net lake evaporation from fifteen reservoirs in the South Saskatchewan River Basin of Alberta based on Morton's complementary relationship-based model. We ranked the reservoirs based on various criteria to identify the reservoirs with significant evaporative losses. The net maximum annual evaporative loss from fifteen reservoirs ranges from 659 cubic decameters (dam(3)) to 21,251 dam(3). Our analysis reveals that there are six reservoirs with significant net evaporative losses (e.g., > 70% of total annual maximum net loss). We also performed additional evaporative loss calculations on these six reservoirs using the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Agency (PFRA)-modified Meyer's method. We compared the differences between the two evaporation models. Our results show that Morton's model shows better consistency than PFRA-Meyer's model considering data availability and the sensitivity of evaporation estimates. We also applied Morton's shallow lake and deep lake models for those six reservoirs to analyze the seasonal variabilities in evaporative losses. Although on an annual scale, both models provide similar results, we demonstrated that the deep lake model is able to capture monthly variabilities better than the shallow lake model.

MICROPLASTICS IN THE FRESH WATERS OF THE COASTAL OASIS OF THE EAST ANTARCTICA (ON AN EXAMPLE OF THE THALA HILLS, ENDERBY LAND)	DOKLADY NATSIONALNOI AKADEMII NAUK BELARUSI												The first data on the content of microplastic particles in freshwater reservoirs of the East Antarctica (by the example of the Thala Hills Oasis, Enderby Land) are presented. The studies were made during the 14th BAE in 2022/2023 with the selection and filtration of water from three lakes and one temporary reservoir. Filtration was carried out in two stages: in the field conditions through a plankton network to concentrate a sample and then in the laboratory through White Ribbon filters. Dried filters after delivery to Minsk were analyzed using a microscope, digital camera and consulting software. It was found that microplastic particles were present in all analyzed samples. Fibers dominated in all samples, amounting to 81 % of the total microplastic particles. The particle size, represented by fragments of irregularly shaped plastics, is less than 1 mm in 90 % of cases. The fiber size in 91 % of cases ranges from 1 to 5 mm with a maximum value of 16.4 mm. The importance of developing research and assessing the levels of microplastic pollution in Antarctic fresh water is shown with the consideration of seasonal changes in their condition, morphometric and other features.

Mean annual, seasonal climate and streamflow changes were assessed for each sub-basin. Rainy season (June to September) precipitation becomes enhanced, while it becomes reduced during other seasons, hence mean annual decreased relative to historical. Average wet and dry season runoff change ranges from +67% to -52.16% and +62.6% to -59% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 during the mid-term (2050s), while during long-term (2080s) changes from +61.3% to -57% and +78.3% to -53.6% across three sub-basins. The projected mean annual streamflow showed a decrement of 10.6% for Kesse and Belles sub-basins and an increment of up to 25% for Didessa sub-basin.																			2042-7808	2042-7816					2024	17	3								10.1504/IJHST.2024.137777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJHST.2024.137777													WOS:001198218900002
J	Khayyati, M; Hassanpour, J				Khayyati, Marzieh; Hassanpour, Jafar			Investigating the reactivation potential of an old huge dormant landslide adjacent to the Miyaneh-Ardabil railway, Iran	GEOPERSIA												In this study, the possibility of reactivation of an undetected dormant landslide whose reactivation can be very risky for a railway bridge is investigated. Landslide #370 is a huge dormant landslide that occurred in the chainage of 370 km of the Miyaneh-Ardabil railway which is under construction in the Northwestern part of Iran. The big Bridge #12 of this railway is located in the vicinity of the landslide's toe. Besides, this landslide is adjacent to Shahriar Dam Lake. Therefore, there are concerns about the possibility of landslide reactivation and the effects of these activities on two adjacent projects. Due to factors such as ground perturbation performed during the construction of the railway and access road to the dam site, the rising water level of the dam lake to a level very close to the landslide toe, high seismicity of the region, and high seasonal precipitations, it is essential to investigate the possibility of reactivation of this major landslide. The above factors can all work to reduce the safety factor of this old landslide. Therefore, in this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of the temporal change of influencing factors on landslide stability and provide solutions to reduce the risk of landslide reactivation. Both limit equilibrium and numerical methods were employed to evaluate the stability conditions of this huge landslide in the future. The results of the performed studies indicate that due to the occurrence of a long/heavy rainfall and/or a large earthquake in the surrounding areas, the safety factor along the identified failure surface will decrease and this reduction will be enough to bring the landslide to a critical situation. So, risk reduction methods must be designed and implemented to prevent a tragic event.

Lake-wide measurements of primary productivity in Lake Erie	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Few lake-wide, seasonal primary production measurements have been made in Lake Erie. None more recent than 1997 have been reported in the literature. In 2019 we used C-13 uptake to measure production at 11 stations across the lake during three surveys in May, July, and September and at four of these stations during two additional surveys in April and August. Samples were collected at two depths (2 m and 6 m) and incubated on deck using eight levels of irradiance. We fit the resultant photosynthesis-irradiance curves with models that included the initial slope at low light levels, the maximum photosynthesis rate at light saturation, and when warranted, the negative slope at high irradiance. During May, there was little variation in chlorophyll-normalized volumetric productivity with sample depth, and productivity generally was higher nearshore and in the western basin than it was offshore. The distinction between nearshore and offshore stations was less pronounced in July, but nearshore productivity was higher than offshore in September. Using the photosynthesis data from all five surveys, chlorophyll concentration profiles, and estimated clear-sky solar insolation, we calculated time series of vertically integrated daily production at a western basin station, two central basin stations, and an eastern basin station. Central basin production was highest during August, estimated to be 748 mg C m(-2) d(-1) and 779 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at our two stations. Production peaked in July in the western basin (510 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and September in the eastern basin (421 mg C m(-2) d(-1)). Whole-lake seasonal areal phytoplankton photosynthesis was estimated as 1.661E6 tonnes, about half of estimates made in the 1990s using C-14 methods. These results inform our understanding of spatial-temporal trends in Lake Erie productivity and highlight the need for continued measurements of Lake Erie primary production.																			1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-MAR	2024	27	1					30	45		10.14321/aehm.027.01.30	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.027.01.30													WOS:001326942900004

First, we collect hourly meteorological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Integrated Surface Data (ISD), which includes 16 key metrics such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation. We then use the Spark framework and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, accounting for seasonal trends, to predict meteorological conditions based on the collected data. Subsequently, we combine a dynamic risk assessment model with the Endoh crash risk model to calculate the probability of a crash. Finally, we design a three-dimensional ant colony system variant, referred to as ACS-DS-R, to plan UAV trajectories, incorporating meteorological predictions and topographical information. Our proposed framework dynamically adjusts UAV paths based on terrain data and real-time meteorological predictions to avoid high-risk areas, significantly reducing crash rates. We present extensive numerical results using real data from across Japan-including cities, forests, lakes, coasts, and mountainous areas-demonstrating that our approach reduces crash probability by more than 33%, improves the task completion rate by about 2.58 times while increasing total energy consumption by only 13% compared to existing mainstream approaches. Our work demonstrates the value of integrating real-time meteorological predictions and topographical data into UAV trajectory planning, offering a practical solution for safer and more efficient UAV deployments in diverse environments.

In this work, the seasonal variations and relationships between physico-chemical variables and the structure and composition of the macroinvertebrate community were analyzed considering "season", "type of ecosystem" and "site" factors. Five sites of representative ecosystems at Lauca River Basin of the Chilean Altiplano were sampled, two of them lentic and three lotic. Two field-sampling periods within a year according to the pre- and post-rain seasons characteristic of the Altiplano climate were considered. Thirty-five taxa were identified, and it was observed that the taxa Orthocladiinae, Austrelmis sp., Hyallela cf kochi, Podonominae and Helicopsychidae were indicator taxa that contributed the most to differences among sites or ecosystems (>= 10 %.). No significant differences were found in the alpha diversity indicators used, except for some abundance values and Pielou's Evenness index (J '), which varied significantly between lotic and lentic systems. The results of the ordination analysis showed a significant differentiation considering physical and chemical variables and macroinvertebrates assemblages that responded to "sites" (ANOSIM R Global = 0.64, p = 0.001) and "type of ecosystem" factors (ANOSIM R Global = 0.31, p = 0.02). The "season" factor was not statistically significant to explain the variability of biological data (ANOSIM R Global = -0.003, p = 0.47) and was slight and marginally significant with the physical and chemical data (ANOSIM R Global = 0.1, p = 0.04). In addition, the linear redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that physico-chemical variables related to hardness, temperature, phosphorous, and nitrogen explained most of the variance in the biological data (the first two canonical axes RDA1 and RDA2 explained 45.23 % of the total variation, p = 0.004). These results support the relevance of local conditions for high altitude wetlands and how those environmental characteristics can be reflected in the macroinvertebrate assemblages that inhabit them.

Recently, this region has faced extreme climate conditions, more water in the rainy season, and drought in the dry months, which is a big concern for the Thai government to resolve. Lakes are essential in supporting the local nation in this area to solve the problem. Nong Han Lake is the second biggest nature lake in Thailand. Therefore, information on the hydrologic system is essential for efficient water management. This work focused on estimating the evaporation loss of the water system for Nong Han Lake. The relationship of evaporation with solar radiation (SR) and metrological parameters was investigated using the linear mixed effect (LME). Evaporation (EVA) data were retrieved from the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD), and metrological parameters were obtained from the Research (NCAR) global reanalysis. SR was downloaded from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). EVA changes throughout the year, reaching a peak in April compared with December. The model confirms that predicted EVA obtained from meteorological parameters has a high performance for increasing existing ground-based EVA monitoring networks.																			0858-849X						2024	31	4							030214	10.55766/sujst-2024-04-e03052	http://dx.doi.org/10.55766/sujst-2024-04-e03052													WOS:001318488200001

Suitability of the Drinking Qualities of Ground and SurfaceWater Sources in Bhopal City for Futuristic Needs: A Comparative Study	TOWARDS WATER CIRCULAR ECONOMY, RWC 2024	Springer Proceedings in Earth and Environmental Sciences				Conference on Responsible Water Management and Circular Economy (RWC)	MAR 03-06, 2024	IIT Roorkee, Roorkee, INDIA		IIT Roorkee			Water pressure is increasing continuously with environmental change, pollution, and an increasing population. This work examines the suitability of the water potability of surface and groundwater sources in Bhopal City presently. The seasonal changes have been seen in physicochemical parameters on a monthly basis for six months. The potability of the water has also been checked for water sources that have not been used for drinking purposes. Sixteen physicochemical properties were analyzed of water that was collected from the tube wells and reservoirs located in Bhopal, the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. Nine water samples were tested according to APHA's (American Public health Association) 23rd edition on selected parameters. The findings were subjected to comparative study and mathematical modeling to draw conclusions. The high iron (Fe) content of three groundwater sites, viz, Kolua Khurd (3.01 mg/l), Chhawani Pathar (3.08 mg/l) and Kerwa (2.20 mg/l) exceeded the permissible limit (1.0 mg/l) given by World Health Organization (WHO). The COD value (55.75 mg/l) for Upper Lake indicated contamination of principle drinking water source due to highly oxidizable pollutants from the city. The physicochemical data was also checked for Gibbs and Piper plot and it was inferred that both water sources belong to rock dominance with Mg(HCO3)(2) hydrochemical facies. The other parameters assured safe potability of water. The results showed that the water sources in Bhopal are still healthy for drinking purposes. They are safe to use and may be stored for future needs. The dams that have been used for fulfilling irrigation needs can also be considered for household requirements.																			2524-342X	2524-3438	978-3-031-60438-6; 978-3-031-60436-2; 978-3-031-60435-5				2024							1	25		10.1007/978-3-031-60436-2_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-60436-2_1													WOS:001284709900001

Detection and mapping of supraglacial lakes on East Antarctic margin using Landsat 8 OLI during 2014-2023	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												Using an optical band index generated from Landsat 8 OLI data, an inventory of Antarctic supraglacial lakes (size >0.01 km2) during 2014-2023 is presented. Shaded snow, cloud and rock shadow were removed by using a band-based filter. Over the north Antarctica, we identified 639 lakes covering an area of 520.79 km2, 1025 lakes covering 272.82 km2 over the East Antarctica, and 1045 lakes covering 93 km2 over south Antarctica. The influence of air temperature, 10-m zonal/meridional wind components and climate indices on surface melt were investigated. Over the north Antarctica, air temperature promoted melt, while F & ouml;hn and katabatic winds warmed adiabatically along the leeward side of the elevated features and initiated melt in south Antarctica. Nearly all areas have exhibited a decrease in melt over the past few years, and the number of melt cases dropped after 2020. Negative SAM index favoured melt over the north Antarctica. This study identified new SGLs, which will be a benchmark for further studies. The undulating terrain posed a difficulty for collecting and interpreting satellite data, which should be addressed using advanced technologies and algorithms.

Close coordination with project stakeholders, including regulatory agencies, customers, residents, community members, and business owners, during the planning, design, and construction stages is crucial to any project's success, particularly with complex situations, such as pipeline river crossings. The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) provides clean, safe drinking water to 88 member partners across 112 southeast Michigan communities, equivalent to nearly 40% of Michigan's population. GLWA is in the design and construction phases of the relocation of a 96-in., 2.5-mi drinking water transmission main around a closed industrial landfill, near Shelby Township, Michigan. The 96in.-diameter pipeline serves over one million people in southeast Michigan. The first phase of the project includes 2,220 linear feet of water transmission main (WTM) and roadway improvements across the Clinton River and through a major intersection and adjacent popular, seasonal business. The Clinton River crossing will be the focus of this paper. This paper will discuss the collaboration of the Project Team for the execution of this crossing: GLWA, Jacobs (the Engineer), and Kiewit [the Construction Management at Risk (CMAR) Contractor]. During the project planning phase, GLWA and the Engineer conducted an alternatives analysis to make the determination between open-cut and trenchless crossing of the Clinton River. In coordination with Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), GLWA and the Engineer selected open-cut as the crossing method, to be discussed in the paper. Due to the extensive process and long permitting schedule, GLWA and the Engineer involved EGLE early in the planning and design phases to inform and coordinate prior to the permit submittals, including field visits and discussions. During the design phase, the Engineer developed a conceptual layout and technical requirements for the crossing and obtained the wetland and floodplain permit from EGLE. This included flood modeling, scour analysis, pipeline alignment (for pipe pre-purchase), and river restoration coordination. Once the CMAR Contractor was under contract, they used the Engineer-provided flood model, technical requirements, and permit-required analysis to design the cofferdam and crossing. The construction phase occurred between November 2022 and September 2023. As can be expected with river crossings, there were challenges that arose, and the Project Team worked together to solve the challenges. The resolution of these challenges along with lessons learned throughout the process will be detailed in the paper.																					978-0-7844-8557-6				2024							121	130																WOS:001305968800013

Our research, conducted during June and August, revealed a total of 81 species of algae and cyanobacteria, with cyanobacteria predominating. Among these cyanobacteria and microalgae (Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta), algae that serve as reliable indicators of water quality were identified. The assessment of water quality based on abundance and species composition of indicator phytoplankton species revealed that the waters of the Pechorskoe Reservoir belong to the III class (beta-mesosaprobic or moderately polluted). This indicates that water quality is satisfactory, and the reservoir retains the ability to self-purify. The power plant's discharges heat the surface layers, increasing plankton communities' diversity, abundance, and biomass. Such stable warming in the upper layers throughout the season, uncommon for natural water bodies in the north, results in a slight increase in the trophic status of the studied reservoir, supported by hydrochemical analysis. These results provide valuable information about ecosystem functioning under temperature increasing for predicting changes in the phototrophic biota of small northern reservoirs facing the impacts of climate change.					; Barinova, Sophia/AAH-6720-2019; Patova, Elena/O-1154-2015; Shabalina, Julia/F-2979-2016	Barinova, Sophia/0000-0001-9915-2503; 														2075-1729				JAN	2024	14	1							71	10.3390/life14010071	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life14010071								38255687					WOS:001151548900001
J	Pham-Duc, B				Pham-Duc, Binh			Comparison of Synthetic Aperture Radar Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 observations for lake monitoring	VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												This work investigates the efficacy of L -band and C -band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors onboard ALOS-2 and Sentinel -1 satellites, as compared to optical sensors onboard Sentinel -2 satellite, for mapping open water of the Tri An reservoir, one of the largest artificial reservoirs in South Vietnam, during the 2016-2023 period. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) was the primary computing platform to pre-process all satellite observations. The Otsu threshold algorithm was employed to generate water/non-water maps derived from the VH- and HH-polarized backscatter coefficient data acquired by Sentinel -1 and ALOS-2 satellites and from the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) data acquired by Sentinel -2 satellite, respectively. The findings reveal the stability of Tri An reservoir's surface water extent from 2017 to 2022, followed by a significant decline of nearly 70% during the dry season of 2023 to approximately 100 km2. This substantial decrease can be explained by the impact of a robust El Nino phase occurring in the region simultaneously. Overall, there is a high consistency between results derived from SAR and optical sensors, but the correlation between Sentinel -1 and Sentinel -2 (R = 0.9774) was higher than that between ALOS-2 and Sentinel -2 (R = 0.9145). During the drought period, both C -band and L -band SAR sensors overestimate the reservoir's surface water extent due to the similarity in their backscatter coefficient between water and dry flat soil surfaces. This misclassification is more pronounced in ALOS-2 data than Sentinel -1 data, suggesting that the C -band sensor is more suitable than the L -band sensor for mapping the lake's open water areas.																			0866-7187	2615-9783					2024	46	3					322	338		10.15625/2615-9783/20639	http://dx.doi.org/10.15625/2615-9783/20639													WOS:001257343800002

However, a similar study in the southern part of Siberia has not yet been carried out. In this regard, this study aims to estimate the mean values of the electric field and their variations in the mountain and steppe landscapes using the measurement data from the Khakass-Tyva expedition in 2022. The maximum values of positive ion density were noted at the site in the Iyussko-Shirinsky steppe between Belyo and Tus salt lakes in the Khakass-Minusinsk Basin. The maximum values of negative ion density were observed at the site in the Shol tract in the center part of the Tyva depression. The potential gradient tends to increase with altitude and reaches a maximum in the highlands. The maximum values of the potential gradient were noted in the highlands plateau near the Mongun-Taiga Mountain Massif and Khindiktig-Khol Lake. The diurnal cycles of potential gradient at different observation sites were divided into two groups: (1) a diurnal cycle in the form of a double wave; and (2) a daily cycle with a more complex course due to the strong influence of local factors.

Accurate estimates of fecundity plays a crucial role in comprehending fish population dynamics. The snowtrout, Schizopyge niger, is a Cyprinid fish widely distributed throughout the lakes of Kashmir valley and is one of the most important commercial fish species. In this study, we examined the age-dependent reproductive performance of female S. niger, aiming to gain insights into its breeding characteristics for the development of an optimal brood-stock management plan. The study involved 78 female S. niger specimens collected from Dal Lake during the spawning season, representing age groups of 2(+), 3(+), 4(+), 5(+), and 6(+) years. Fecundity and ova diameter showed an increasing trend from age 2(+) (3,971 eggs; 1.45 mm) to age 6(+) (10,501 eggs; 2.00 mm). Total fecundity exhibited positive correlations with age, total weight, ovary weight, and ova diameter. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between ova diameter and fish age, with the highest fecundity and largest ova diameter observed in the 6(+) years age group. Among each age group, fecundity and ova diameter varied significantly (p <0.05). Based on these findings, for optimal broodstock management of S. niger, it is recommended to use females of the 6+ years age group after assessing the quality of eggs.

J	Rodríguez-Estrada, J; Martínez-Jerónimo, F				Rodriguez-Estrada, Jesus; Martinez-Jeronimo, Fernando			Cladocera in the eutrophic reservoir of Valle de Bravo. Annual study on its diversity, distribution, abundance, and new records	HIDROBIOLOGICA												Background. The Valle de Bravo reservoir is part of the Cutzamala system that supplies drinking water to Mexico City. For this reason, it is essential to guarantee its conservation and the quality of its waters. Due to the increased discharge of agrochemical pollutants and domestic wastewater discharges into the reservoir, the eutrophication of its waters has been accelerated. Eutrophication is associated with developing harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs), which can affect aquatic communities. Goals. This study aimed to evaluate the diversity, species richness, and abundance of cladocerans in the Valle de Bravo reservoir and to determine the impact of this eutrophic environment. Methods. Zooplankton samples were obtained at six sampling stations through vertical throws, monthly during an annual cycle. Results. In total, 12 species of cladocerans were recorded, of which eight are new records for Valle de Bravo. The highest density of cladocerans occurred in March and June, with a notable decrease from August to November. Sampling sites S1, S2, and S4 had cladoceran densities higher than 60 ind. L-1. The species with the highest density was Bosmina longirostris, and five species were recorded throughout the year. The Shannon diversity index showed low values (1.0 a 1.48) associated with a eutrophic aquatic system. Conclusions. Even though the Valle de Bravo dam had blooms dominated by cyanobacteria at all times, the species richness was high compared to other freshwater ecosystems in Mexico, possibly reflecting that previous collection efforts were not intense enough to reflect the diversity and richness we recorded. Finally, the harmful effects of cyanobacterial blooms on aquatic biota cannot be ruled out.																			0188-8897					JAN-APR	2024	34	1					35	49																WOS:001186977700004

Features of the periglacial drainage lakes in Svalbard	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												There are 705 periglacial lakes in Svalbard, formed by glacial retreat after the Little Ice Age. 98 of these lakes, with an area of more than 100 000 m(2), have river outflow. The rivers flowing from these lakes have significant channel slopes characteristic of mountainous regions. Most rivers flow into fjords. The morphometry of these objects has a characteristic feature: lakes have significant water surface areas, on average about 1.5 km(2), and rivers have a small length, on average about 2.5 km. To the greatest extent, these parameters correspond to moraine-dammed lakes located in the west of Svalbard. On the example of the moraine-dammed Lake Bretj & oslash;rna with an area of 1.6 km(2), it is shown that that the seasonal runoff from it is 2.5-3 times greater than the volume of the lake. Seven lakes have been identified that are of interest for studying sedimentation changes since the Little Ice Age, both in lake basins and in marine estuaries.

These structures, known as petees, can be classified according to their morphology and origin. They have been classified into three different types and can be formed by the action of the wind on the poorly developed microbial mats (alpha-petees), by the joint action of the accumulation of gases and evaporitic precipitation on the mats (beta-petees) and by the lateral expansion produced by crystalline growth (gamma-petees). The petees are distributed according to the variations in the water level that floods the playa lake in the rainy seasons. In such way, beta-petees predominate in the NW, where the water sheet evaporates earlier, and alpha-petees predominate in the SE, where the water accumulates for longer periods of time. Gamma-petees are located in the intermediate zone, where the presence of the water sheet is more variable. During the dry seasons, the playa lake dries out completely, leaving the microbial mat exposed to evaporitic precipitation processes.																			0213-683X	2173-6545				JAN-JUN	2024	75						15	18		10.55407/geogaceta100779	http://dx.doi.org/10.55407/geogaceta100779													WOS:001324715600004

J	Simakova, AV; Babkina, IB; Babkin, AM; Poltoratskaya, N; Poltoratskaya, TN; Shikhin, A				Simakova, Anastasia, V; Babkina, Irina B.; Babkin, Alexander M.; Poltoratskaya, Natalya, V; Poltoratskaya, Tatiana N.; Shikhin, Alexander, V			The current situation of opisthorchiasis in the Tomsk region	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA												. Trematodes of the family Opisthorchidae are the cause of liver and biliary tract diseases in humans and carnivores, and a risk factor for malignant tumors of the hepatobiliary system. The world's largest focus of opisthorchiasis is associated with the Ob-Irtysh basin. Almost all territories adjacent to this basin are unfavorable for opisthorchiasis, and Tomsk Oblast occupies one of the leading places in terms of infestation of the population with cat fluke. The aims of the study were to assess the current epizootic and epidemiological situation regarding opisthorchiasis and to identify the key links that determine the maintenance of the focus of opisthorchiasis in Tomsk Oblast. This article is dedicated to the memory of M. D. Ruzsky, one of the founders of parasitological research at Tomsk State University. Snails of the family Bithyniidae are the first intermediate hosts of Opisthorhis felineus Rivolta, 1884. According to previous studies held in the 1970s, in the hyperendemic foci of the Middle Ob region, the extent of snail invasion did not exceed 3%. According to later data by S.A. Beer, the extent of invasion was also low (3.7%), reaching 37% only in some biotopes located near populated areas, while the intensity of invasion was very high (an average of 8130 cercariae per snail). As a result of the studies in the period from 2019 to 2022 in floodplain reservoirs of the Ob and Tom rivers, O. felineus parthenites were detected only in Bithynia troschelii Bielz, 1853. The number of snail varied widely from 3 to 52.5 specimens/m2. 2 . In May, infected snails were not recorded, they began to be observed only from mid-June. The extent of invasion (EI) of B. troscheli snails by O. felineus parthenites as a whole was 1.09% (varied from 0.38% to 14.3%.), significantly varied depending on the reservoir, season, and year of observation. Thus, the number of snails infected with O. felineus cercariae in Tomsk Oblast is at a low level. Of the 14 species of carp fish living in the Middle Ob basin, 11 species were examined for infection with metacercariae O. felineus (ide Leuciscus idus, dace Leuciscus baicalensis, roach Rutilus rutilus, bleak Alburnus alburnus, belica Leucaspius delineatus, bream Abramis brama, golden crucian carp Carassius carassius, silver crucian carp Carassius gibelio, tench Tinca tinca, gudgeon Gobio sibiricus, and minnow Phoxinus ujmonensis). High EI rates were observed in ide (100%), dace (81.6%), tench (89.3%), and belica (41.5%), whereas EI of other fish varies from 2.1 to 17.1%. It has been shown that the infestation of fish increases with age, as metacercariae accumulate in the muscles of the fish, while no dependence of infestation on the sex of the fish has been identified. We recorded bleak infected with O. felineus metacercariae for the first time in the Middle Ob basin, in the period from 2016 to 2021, an increase in the extent of invasion was noted. A sharp increase in EI was detected in 2020, the figure was 52.6%, and in this year the maximum value of the intensity of invasion (II) was noted up to 13.1 spec./ind.; in the remaining years of observation, II averaged 1 specimen/individual. It may be noted that in the period 2020-2021 in tench and belica, the maximum infection was noted in 2020, so the EI of tench was 100% in 2020 and 40% in 2021, in belica it was 73.3% and 32.4%, respectively. Thus, the greatest epizootological burden of opisthor-chiasis is carried by four species of fish: ide and dace, mainly in rivers; tench and belica in lakes and oxbow lakes. Wild and domestic carnivores, the same as humans, are the definitive hosts of the cat fluke O. felineus. . Of the 27 species of mammals recorded in Tomsk Oblast, trematodes O. felineus were previously recorded in sable Martes zibellina, , muskrat Ondatra zibethicus, , weasel Mustela sibirica, , and fox Vulpes vulpes. . We examined scatological material from 5 species of wild animals (brown bear Ursus arctos, , muskrat Ondatra zibethicus, , american mink Neovison vison, , sable Martes zibellina, , and fox Vulpes vul- pes) ) and from domestic dogs. No parasite eggs were found. Thus, at present, carnivores play a minor role in the circulation of opisthorchiasis in Tomsk Oblast. Another key link that plays an important role in maintaining the focus of opisthor-chiasis is humans, as they represent the most infected component among the definitive hosts. On the territory of Tomsk Oblast from 2002 to 2022, 58 253 new cases of this disease were registered. The incidence of opisthorchiasis in 2002 exceeded the average in the Russian Federation by 22 times, in 2022 - by 7 times. Regional morbidity rates ranged from 677 per 100 thousand populations (2002) to 56.44 per 100 thousand populations (2012) with a downward trend. The average annual incidence rate of the entire population of Tomsk Oblast over the past 20 years was 278.59 cases per 100 thousand populations. At the same time, the incidence rate is unevenly distributed throughout the region. The maximum rates are recorded in the north of Tomsk Oblast: Alexandrovsky (420.51 per 100 thousand population), Verkhneketsky (502.76 per 100 thousand population), Kargasoksky (637.68 per 100 thousand population), Parabelsky (472.98 per 100 thousand population), Teguldetsky (902.91 per 100 thousand population), Chainsky (395.16 per 100 thousand population) districts and the city of Kedrovy (475.22 per 100 thousand population). Of the total number of cases of opisthorchiasis, 23.1% were children under 17 years of age. The highest incidence of opisthorchiasis in children under 17 years of age was noted in Verkhneketsky (996.42 per 100 thousand population), Teguldetsky (2667.38 per 100 thousand population), Parabelsky (1234.15 per 100 thousand population), Kargasoksky (1867.53 per 100 thousand population), and Aleksan-drovsky (1428.8 per 100 thousand population) districts. Thus, the current epizootic situation regarding opisthorchiasis in Tomsk Oblast is extremely tense. Analysis of the relationships between the components of the life cycle of the trematode O. felineus revealed the key links in maintaining the focus of opisthorchiasis: snails and humans. The development of measures to interrupt connections in the life cycle of opisthorchiasis should be aimed at reducing the number of snails near populated areas, preventing the release of eggs from wastewater into water bodies and therapeutic and preventive work with the population.

A case study in Dak Lak province, Central Highlands (Vietnam)	ADVANCES IN GEODESY AND GEOINFORMATION												Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors in Vietnam, however, in recent times, agricultural production has been negatively affected by drought, reducing crop productivity and quality. Due to the effects of climate change, drought occurs in most regions of the country with varying degrees and duration, seriously affecting water resources and agricultural production. Particularly for the Central Highlands region, drought is a natural disaster with the most negative impacts on life and production. This paper presents the results of monitoring the changes in water surface area of some reservoirs in Dak Lak province in the dry season in early 2020 from Sentinel 2 data. The MNDWI index calculated from green and NIR band of Sentinel 2 images is used to extract surface water, and thereby evaluating the change in surface water area of the reservoirs. The obtained results show a very strong decrease in water surface area of reservoirs in Dak Lak due to the influence of drought. The water surface area of Ea Sup Thuong Lake decreased about 6 times at the end of the dry season (May 2020) compared to the period of January 2020. The water surface area of Ea Uy Lake decreased about 4 times, while with the Krong Buk Ha Lake, the decrease in water surface area was lower, reaching about 28% compared to the beginning of the dry season. The results obtained in the study provide timely information to help managers effectively respond to the effects of drought on water resources.

VoI was estimated by comparing the expected costs when decisions are taken with limited information relying on regular monitoring campaigns, against the outcomes of decisions taken with "better information" conveyed by the PrimeWater services. Expected costs considered health impacts, monitoring costs, and lost recreational revenues in case of false alarms. Four PrimeWater monitoring and forecasting services were evaluated based on their accuracy in assessing bloom conditions against in-situ data for 2015-2019. Results suggest VoI varies seasonally and between services depending on accuracy metrics and underlying bloom probabilities. Forecasting solutions provide the greatest potential savings, highlighting needs for balanced metrics to avoid excess false alarms. Findings support flexible use of EO information to complement existing programs and inform science-based management aimed at reducing societal vulnerability to HABs.

One of the major health issues is the consumption of potentially toxic elements through fish intake, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the human health risks of fish consumers. This study aims to determine concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn in the liver and muscle of freshwater carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) caught in El Tunal River, Durango, Mexico. Carps were collected in dry (n = 7) and rainy (n = 10) seasons. The highest concentrations of all elements were found in the liver, where As and Zn (4.83 and 6.51 mu g/g w/w, respectively) were predominant. Meanwhile, As, Cr, and Zn (1.00, 1.12, and 1.09 mu g/g w/w, respectively) were predominant in muscle. The concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Pb, and Zn had significant differences between seasons (p < 0.05), showing that during the rainy season the concentration of elements in the river, and hence in fish tissues, was reduced. Elements in edible tissue were below the levels allowed in Mexico and by international agencies. The mean and total target hazard quotients were below 1, indicating a minor risk to human health. Based on this study, fish consumption does not represent a risk to human health; however, it is necessary to continue monitoring pollutants since their accumulation can increase over time.

A Parametric Approach Towards Carbon Net Zero in Agricultural Planning	PHYGITAL INTELLIGENCE, CDRF 2023	Computational Design and Robotic Fabrication				5th International Conference on Computational Design and Robotic Fabrication (CDRF)	JUN 24, 2023	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA					This paper presents a new tool called the Space Data Generator, which is a parametric tool for organizing open spaces in rural areas. It can optimize the layout of buildings, solar panels, and agricultural planting spaces. While architects have been exploring ways to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in building design, it is equally important to attain a feasible carbon-neutral goal in rural areas. This is particularly crucial as 40% of the world's population resides in rural areas, and transitioning towards a more sustainable and efficient economy can bring about not only moral but also economic benefits through proper management [1]. The Space Date Generator offers a powerful spatial planning approach for optimizing and planning agricultural resources on any given land. This innovative tool utilizes a combination of remote sensing to generate precise maps of the land, providing a comprehensive understanding of its terrain and potential agricultural resources. With this information, farmers and land managers can make informed decisions about crop selection, irrigation, and fertilizer application, among other factors. By using the Space Date Generator, they can optimize the use of available resources and maximize crop yields, ultimately increasing profitability and sustainability in agriculture [2]. Overall, the Space Date Generator is a valuable tool for any farmer or land manager looking to make the most of their land and resources. Its ability to provide detailed and accurate data on the land's potential agricultural resources can help to streamline decision-making processes and ultimately lead to more efficient and sustainable land use practices. 1. The Space data generator uses the collected site coordinate information, geographical status (including stones, lakes, and water patterns), and the planted plants' price as input. 2. Divide the site into small squares, then configure enough solar panels in the optimal sunlight area of the site to meet the user's needs, and then plant crops on the remaining land. 3. The Space data generator will analyze the number of calories a household needs each year as a percentage. If there is a surplus, the excess food can be allocated to generate economic outcomes on the market. The land area at hand will be subdivided based on its sun ratio, which is a relatively straightforward process. However, we are also interested in determining the value of excess vegetation that may grow in the allocated space. In this regard, the Space Data Generator can prove to be a valuable tool, not only for this particular scenario but also in other types of agricultural settings such as those involving a mix of livestock and crops. Additionally, it may be possible to use this tool to calculate the optimal harvesting of various plant species at different points in the seasonal cycle. The Space Date Generator has the potential to offer valuable references for optimizing agricultural schemes. However, it must provide users with completely accurate results. Unfortunately, it currently cannot measure crucial factors such as soil type and moisture level, which are essential for agricultural planning. Despite this limitation, the Space Data Generator is a flexible tool that can be modified as research advances, allowing for more inputs to be added to improve its accuracy. Moreover, the Space Data Generator can provide guidance in various other areas based on the specific needs of the user.

In the Larsemann oasis, there is a significant number of over 150 small lakes, which can be observed with high spatial resolution in remote sensing imagery. However, accurately identifying and analyzing these small water bodies and elongated rivers has been challenging due to the mixed pixels effect and limitations in available middle spatial resolution imagery. In our study, we propose a data-driven approach within the conditional random fields framework, which considers three scales: superpixel, pixel, and subpixel, to refine the boundaries of small water bodies efficiently. The superpixel level quickly identifies the main water body and normalized difference water index provides a buffer region, while the pixel level employs support vector machine (SVM) to obtain a more precise boundary. Subpixel mapping technology within the pixel level further reduces mixed pixel effects for improved accuracy. The waterbodies were extracted from Sentinel-2 images with a spatial resolution of 10 m. The lake boundaries derived from the proposed algorithm in this study showed good agreement with in situ measurements of the lake shoreline delineated by aerial images from the 39th Chinese Antarctic Scientific Expedition. The analysis revealed distinct seasonal patterns across the Larsemann Hills, while the lake areas achieved their peak extents earlier, specifically in February before 2020 and in January after 2020. The water body mapping based on the proposed algorithm can contribute to Antarctic remote sensing hydrological observations, particularly in the monitoring of outburst events. These findings demonstrate the potential of extending this method to other Antarctic oases to enhance intra-annual lake observations. Moreover, Sentinel-2 images provide valuable remote sensing data for studying the seasonal cycles of water bodies, including those of varying sizes in the Larsemann Hills, based on long-term time series imagery.					; Zhu, Tingting/KIC-4979-2024; lu, kai/KBB-4008-2024	yang, yuande/0000-0001-7689-9698; Lu, Kai/0000-0002-9761-3457; Cui, Xiangbin/0000-0002-4269-8086; Zhu, Tingting/0000-0001-7120-4519													1939-1404	2151-1535					2024	17						9503	9516		10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3391881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3391881													WOS:001225641400020

Water replenishment is frequently applied to drought-stricken rivers to conserve biodiversity and restore ecosystems. To evaluate and improve the effects of different water supply regimes on aquatic environments and organisms, we investigated the species composition and community structure of zooplankton in 2020, following water replenishment in the dried section of the Yongding River in Beijing. Slow base flow of water and flow break were trialed in the mountainous and plain river sections, respectively, during the flooding season (June-August), while short-time pulse high flow was applied outside the flooding season. The results indicated a low-density but stable zooplankton community structure, as well as low nutrient loads with water purification outputs in the flooding season at the mountainous sites. Meanwhile, the absence of flow at plain sites drove isolated lakes or pools into rapid eutrophication and concurrent outbreaks of pollution-indicator rotifers. Compared with the disturbances of high flow, continuous base flow was effective in fostering a river system with lower nutrient loads and higher biostability. Our findings support the importance of water-saving base flows for maintaining aquatic habitats and associated biota, whereas high flows can satisfy the nutrient diffusion and special life activities of aquatic organisms in arid river management.

Characterization of skin- and intestine microbial communities in migrating High Arctic lake whitefish and cisco	ARCTIC SCIENCE												At high latitudes, lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and others in the closely related Coregonus species complex (CSC) including cisco (C. autumnalis and C. sardinella) can be diadromous, seasonally transitioning between freshwater lakes and the Arctic Ocean. CSC skin-and intestine microbiomes were collected, facilitated by Inuit fishers at sites on and around King William Island, Nunavut, at the northern range limits of lake whitefish. Community composition was explored using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and microbiota distinctly grouped depending on fishing site salinity. Overall, lake whitefish intestine communities were more variable than those of the two cisco with higher Shannon diversity, suggesting that lake whitefish and their microbiomes could be susceptible to environmental stress possibly leading to dysbiosis. Lake whitefish showed lower condition (K) in the ocean than in freshwater rivers, whereas cisco condition was similar among distinct seasonal habitats. Taken together, the impact of changing habitats on fish condition and microbial composition may inform approaches to CSC health in fisheries and aquaculture, in addition to being relevant for northern Indigenous peoples with subsistence and economic interests in these resources.

PLOS ONE												Records of ice-on and ice-off dates are available for lakes and rivers across the Northern Hemisphere spanning decades and in some cases centuries. This data provides an opportunity to investigate the climatic processes that may control ice phenology. Previous studies have reported a trend toward shorter ice-covered seasons with global warming, as well as links between ice phenology and several modes of natural climate variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Pacific-North American Pattern, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The 11-year sunspot cycle has also been proposed as a driver of ice phenology, which is somewhat surprising given that this cycle's strongest impacts are in the stratosphere. In this study, we use a large data set of lakes and rivers across the Northern Hemisphere to test this potential link. We find little or no connection between the sunspot cycle and either ice-on or ice-off dates. We conclude that while many well-known climate cycles do impact ice phenology, we are able to rule out any strong impact of the solar cycle.

We analyzed the influence of different environmental factors on nesting outcomes and breeding success. Our results indicate that the timing of egg laying is a critical factor influencing both breeding outcomes and the number of fledged chicks. Specifically, our results indicate that nest outcomes become less favorable as the season progresses, with later clutches having a lower probability of success. In addition, the number of successfully fledged chicks is significantly lower for later clutches. Interspecific parasitism was documented in five mixed clutches, involving Ferruginous Duck (Aythya nyroca) in four cases and Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) in one case. Our study highlights the challenges that the hyperarid environment of the Sahara poses for breeding waterbirds. It also highlights the selection pressures exerted by both biotic factors and environmental factors, with temperature, solar radiation, and the presence of protective vegetation playing important roles. Comparative analyzes show that the timing of egg laying has similar effects in other regions, as observed at Lake Tonga further north, where Mallard breeding performance declines as the season progresses. This research not only contributes to our understanding of the nesting ecology of mallards in this unique Saharan wetland but also underscores the urgency of conservation action, especially in the face of ongoing environmental change. It also improves our understanding of waterbird breeding dynamics in the region and highlights the challenges faced by these bird populations in a demanding, arid environment.

However, little attention has been paid to analyzing the influence of landscape connectivity on water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in farm pond catchments. In this study, we developed an integrated landscape connectivity framework that encompasses landscape connectivity metrics, graph theory connectivity indices, and spatial distance. And the graph theory connectivity indices were constructed based on the modified resistance surface using a function that integrated landscape development intensity, slope, and livestock density. Using DOC content data from 86 farm ponds monitored between June 2017 and May 2018. The results demonstrated that the average water DOC content in farm ponds was higher during the dry season (5.35 +/- 2.03 mg/L) compared to the wet season (4.27 +/- 1.40 mg/L). The individual effects of landscape connectivity metrics and graph theory connectivity indices on DOC content were more prominent during the dry season, while the spatial distance had a more significant influence in the wet season. The interactive effects of determinant variables had a more substantial influence on pond water DOC content than their individual effects during both wet and dry seasons. The interactive effect variation ratio (IEVR) of all variables was positive in both seasons (0.143-0.777). Combining landscape connectivity metrics, graph theory connectivity indices, and spatial distance (22.0-24.3%) improved the interpretation of DOC content in comparison to using separate (0.4-12.1%) or paired variables (0.3-19.3%). Our findings suggest that integrated landscape connectivity is necessary to further understand the role of ponds in the organic carbon cycling of surface water. These strategies should not only focus on landscape connectivity metrics, but also consider the influences of graph theory connectivity indices and spatial distance in farm pond catchments.

However, the soil quality under the long-term RC farming system is still unclear. To examine the effects of RC cultivation on soil quality in paddy fields, this study utilized an integrated soil quality index (SQI) for examining the soil quality at different soil profiles (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth) in rice monoculture (RM) and RC farming systems (after 1, 6, 10, and 15 years) scattered in Nanxian County, Hunan Province, China. The minimum datasets for evaluating soil quality were assembled using the soil pH, bulk density, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, and beta-d-glucosidase. The findings demonstrated that soil quality was greatly impacted by RC farming, which improved with the increase of years under RC management. The soil quality of 10- and 15-year RC farming systems were significantly higher than RM system. Besides, soil quality declined with increasing soil depth. The SQI value, which may be used as an indicator to assess the soil quality of RC systems, was dominated by total nitrogen, which contributed 27.60% to the SQI value. On the whole, long-term RC farming affected the soil quality of paddy fields through management methods including non-rice season flooding, feeding, and no tillage. Through this study, it was found that MDS and SQI composed of appropriate physical, chemical, and biological indicators could more objectively analyze the soil quality of long-term RC system and provide guidance for sustainable development of RC farming.					; Xiao, Zhihua/P-5901-2018	Hu, Teng/0000-0001-6295-1811; 													1085-3278	1099-145X				FEB 28	2024	35	4					1352	1364		10.1002/ldr.4991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4991		DEC 2023											WOS:001117230400001
J	Russell, IA				Russell, Ian A.			Waterbird community changes in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa (Part 2 of 3): Shorebirds	KOEDOE												Globally, many shorebirds, particularly the smaller migratory waders are declining, which can be attributed to multiple factors throughout their ranges. The Wilderness Lakes Complex in South Africa comprises two estuarine systems, that support diverse waterbird communities, including 17 abundant shorebirds. The study aimed to document long-term spatial and temporal patterns of abundance of shorebirds in the Wilderness Lakes Complex, and where possible identify potential causes for observed trends. The abundance of waterbirds on these wetlands was determined biannually from 1992 to 2019, with counts conducted from a boat following a standardised route. Historical abundance data from the 1980s were also used to describe long-term abundance changes. Ten shorebirds showed seasonal differences in abundances. Significant long-term decreases in abundance have occurred in seven shorebirds (Wood Sandpiper Tringa glareola, Marsh Sandpiper Tringa cinerea, Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber, Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus) and increases in three species (African Spoonbill Platalea alba, Little Egret Egretta garzetta, Glossy Ibis Plegadis falcinellus). Similar types of population changes occurred across multiple waterbodies and in different seasons. The similarity of shorebird abundance trends in spatially separated wetlands suggests either high interconnectivity of populations between wetlands systems and/or prominent drivers of change being broad scaled rather than system specific. Local reasons for changes potentially include the increasing spread of emergent macrophytes and resultant loss of open sandbanks, changing hydrodynamics, and alien fish proliferation, all likely changing food accessibility, as well as periodic high disturbance by waterbody users. Conservation implications: Changes in the abundances of several shorebirds, particularly small migratory waders, are substantial, with multiple likely local, regional and international drivers acting accumulatively. Recommended corrective actions include continuing involvement in the development and implementation of policies for waterbird conservation, and local management of emergent macrophytes, disturbance, and water level variability.																			0075-6458	2071-0771				DEC 6	2023	65	1							a1771	10.4102/koedoe.v65i1.1771	http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/koedoe.v65i1.1771													WOS:001129586900001

Using supporting variables such as size of nearby ports and bathymetry, our model-assisted estimate of total effort was 6400 (+/- 4300 CI) buoys during the three-weekend season. Using the frequency of buoys to traps as a constant, the total number of crayfish traps was estimated to be 25,500 (+/- 17,000 CI).

According to data from automatic meteorological systems installed in the Aktru basin, it was noted that more active heating in 2021-2023 occurs on the underlying moraines, both in duration and in depth. Heat flow inversions in the Atmosphere - Earth's surface system are associated with a negative radiation balance and are observed from mid-September to June (altitude 2,442 m), and from October to March (altitude 2,840 m). As it turned out, heating of the near-surface layers of moraine deposits at an altitude of 2,442 m can begin as early as March, while at the higher moraine near Blue Lake this period usually shifts by two to three weeks. To identify the relationship between air temperature and the temperature of the surface layers of moraine deposits, correlation analysis was used. The influence of air temperature on the temperature regime of sediments in the same season, but in different years, is not the same. A strong influence was found for layers located at a depth of 0 and 10 cm in all months of the year except October. For a layer of 20 cm - with the exception of April, October, and December. Medium and weak degrees of influence were noted in April, October and December. Most likely, this is due to the nature of the snow cover. At the Goluboye Lake station, wind conditions favor stronger snow blowing than at the underlying station. The influence of air temperature on the temperature regime of sediments in the same season but in different years can change due to differences in the radiation balance, mainly associated with differences in cloudiness characteristics, the presence of ice layers, and the effect of "melting" of the layer by precipitation. Using the example of landslides and avalanches in 2022 and 2023, critical meteorological factors contributing to the emergence of dangerous exogenous processes of gravitational origin in the mountains were analyzed. The identified features will be used to create a forecasting and warning system about dangerous exogenous processes in the mountains.

Variation in copepod stoichiometry with taxonomy, ontogeny, latitude, and habitat	ECOSPHERE												Copepods are the most abundant metazoans on Earth, driving cycles of key elements in aquatic systems, most prominently carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). One key factor determining nutrient cycling is copepod somatic stoichiometry, which can reflect ecological strategy. We conducted a systematic review that updates the seminal work of Bamstedt (1986) by summarizing the effects of latitude, habitat, life history stage, and taxonomy on C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios of field-collected copepods. We found that differences among copepod families accounted for the greatest variation, with the Rhincalanidae and Diaptomidae being particularly C-rich, while the Calanidae were more N- and P-rich. Copepod C:N was higher in inland waters compared with animals from marine environments in both copepodites and adult females, matching the higher C content of seston in many inland freshwaters. For both copepodites and adult females, mid-latitude animals had higher C:N and C:P than high-latitude animals, which matched predictions based on the availability of nutrients or adaptation to cold environments. More data must be gathered to fill gaps in our knowledge of copepod stoichiometry, focusing particularly on younger life stages, non-calanoids, low and high latitudes, the southern hemisphere, and estuarine and some inland water habitats, including large lakes. Such information will help better parameterize models of aquatic ecosystems and improve our understanding of how copepods influence consumer-driven nutrient cycling and food web dynamics.

In this study, the abundance of phytoplankton and its primary productivity were evaluated in Dingapota Haor of Bangladesh. A total of 41 phytoplankton genera belong to Chlorophyceae (15), Bacillariaophyceae (14), Cyanophyceae (8) and Euglenophyceae (4) were recorded whereas Bacillariaophyceae (37.02%) was the most dominant. The highest cell density (22.71x10(4) cell L-1) was recorded in pre-monsoon. Diversity indices were also significantly higher in pre-monsoon. The species diversity, evenness and richness varied from 2.51-3.79, 0.57-0.90 and 4.65-7.50 respectively. Difference in phytoplankton assemblage with an overall average dissimilarity value of 52.56 % was recorded. Cyclotella (3.60%), Bacillaria (3.13%), Volvox (2.95%), Spirulina (2.92%) and Euglena (2.88%) were the five most contributory species to the seasonal variation.

The Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to produce thematic maps of the investigated parameters. Stations used as point feature layers were mapped using quantitative labeling via symbology. The results were compared with Turkish Regulation, 2015 and EC Directive on the quality of fresh waters needing protection or improvement to support fish life (2006) guidelines. According to the results of the analysis, Dams that are located one after the other contribute to the partial cleaning of the water by resting. Sariyar, Gokcekaya, and Yenice Dams were built on the Sakarya River, which is one of Turkiye's biggest and most significant river systems, for electric supply and utility of water for irrigation and fishery activities. Gokcekaya Dam Lake was built between Sariyar Dam and Yenice Dam, which are situated in the same line of Sakarya River. Gokcekaya and Yenice Dams are fed by Sariyar Dam Lake and do not receive fresh water. The fact that the three dams are established one after the other aids in the water's resting and the aids in removing the suspended solids/suspended load. But, this research show that domestic, industrial, agricultural wastes carried by the branches of the rivers caused algal blooms in Dam lakes, especially which are not fed with fresh water. Due to organic pollution the decrease in dissolved oxygen, especially from time to time, negatively affects the ecological life in the lakes.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				DEC	2023	16	6					988	998		10.1134/S1995082923060123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082923060123													WOS:001126976700004

Introducing river water into constructed wetlands along river course has proven to be an effective solution for decreasing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads. This paper reports 9 years of monitoring the Yong'an River and its surrounding constructed wetlands in the upper reaches of Erhai Lake, located in Yunnan Province, China. This study analyzed the main types of pollutants in the river, and evaluated the removal efficiency of pollutants by the constructed wetlands. The findings indicate that total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) are the primary pollutants in the Yong'an River, which exhibit variation throughout the year corresponding to the alternating wet and dry seasons. Although constructed wetlands are effective in removing NO3--N and P, their efficacy in removing ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and organic pollutants is limited. This limitation can be attributed to the lack of timely disposal of aquatic plant residues. This research contributes to the understanding of the potential issues that may arise during the extended use of constructed wetlands and provides solutions to address them.

Analyses were done on the collected samples in order to establish the levels of EC, pH, DO, temperature, conductivity, turbidity, acidity, alkalinity, BOD, COD, DOC, TOC and heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Zn, Cr and Cd) in RY water and sediments adjacent to Agricultural Farms during dry and wet seasons. The levels in terms of mu g/mL, mu S/cm (EC), NTU (turbidity) of analyzed parameters in the Agricultural Farms in water ranged from 0.01 +/- 0.00 to 121.75 +/- 15.23 (Upstream pristine sources of RY - S), 0.02 +/- 0.01 to 184.83 +/- 23.43 (Nandi Tea Estate and Kaimosi Agricultural Farms - N), 0.02 +/- 0.01 to 149.67 +/- 22.77 (Subsistence Farms - Sub), 0.02 +/- 0.01 to 209.33 +/- 18.09 (Lake Agro Limited Agricutural Farms and Yala Swamp - D) and 0.01 +/- 0.00 to 164.25 +/- 30.33 (Terminal of RY - T). The levels in mu g/g of analyzed parameters in sediments ranged from 7.2 +/- 1.46 to 3342.8 +/- 538.7 (S), 9.12 +/- 0.2 to 4063.2 +/- 90.4 (N), 3.15 +/- 1.14 to 5998.5 +/- 588.4 (Sub), 2.03 +/- 0.76 to 4519.8 +/- 194.9 (D) and 2.13 +/- 0.75 to 5514.4 +/- 201.4 (T). The significant differences in the levels of analyzed parameters in water between dry and wet seasons were computed as; EC (+20.54 mu S/cm), alkalinity (-2.85 mu g/mL), DOC (+0.24 mu g/mL), Fe (+0.58 mu g/mL), Pb (+0.11 mu g/mL), Zn (+0.07 mu g/mL) and Cd (+0.01 mu g/mL) while that for Mn in sediment samples was +163.8937 mu g/g. The significantly (p <= 0.05) positive values indicated that wet season had more impact on the levels than dry season. There was positive correlation of zinc in water and sediments during dry and wet season. Chromium correlated positively in water and sediments during wet season. Copper and cadmium correlated negatively during dry and wet season while Mn only wet season. Results of geostatistical indices (CF, Cd, mCd, PLI, Er and RI) indicated that sediments located at regions N, D and T were highly contaminated with the heavy metals. However, a wetland at the mouth of Lake Victoria cleaned the water before it drained into the lake. Therefore, despite contamination of RY through anthropogenic activities, wetland mitigation protects LV from pollution by the river, indicating the important ecological and restorative functions played by wetlands.

J	Nsibirano, R; Odong, R; Masette, M				Nsibirano, Ruth; Odong, Robinson; Masette, Margaret			Quality versus profits from Mukene processing: Untold realities and perspectives from women processors in Uganda	MARITIME STUDIES												There is persistent uproar about the poor quality of processed Rastrineobola Argentea, commonly known as Mukene in Uganda. Efforts put into training women processors on quality control have not deterred poor handling. The purpose of this paper is to explain why discussions about 'quality', ought to take into account the realities of actors. Data was collected from 10 focus group discussions with women processors and 20 key informant interviews, at five fishing sites on Lake Victoria and Albert, and thematically analysed. This study applied gender analysis, a social sciences tool, to examine scientific realities about quality in Mukene processing, through the context and standpoint of women processors. Results show that women processors were aware that poorly processed fish was bad for human consumption and brought in low profits. However, challenges that are encountered, such as low operating capital, seasons interfering with sun drying and personal practical needs made compliance with quality standards problematic. We recommend greater access to friendly credit in order to raise the working capital and to economically empower women processors. Additionally, provision of drying technologies for efficiency, reduced drudgery and scheduled sensitization meetings for behavioural change are recommended. The paper affirms that the necessity to meet practical needs is a lived reality embedded in ascribed gender roles that are prioritized by women over scientific demands on controlling quality.

THE USHKAN'Y ISLANDS, LAKE BAIKAL, AND THEIR ROLE AND SIGNIFICANCE IN THE LIFE OF THE BAIKAL SEAL (PUSA SIBIRICA GMELIN 1788, PINNIPEDIA) IN MODERN CONDITIONS	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												For the first time, a detailed description of the coastline of the Ushkan'y Islands, Lake Baikal is given in order to assess the use of the shore by the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica Gm.) as haulouts, and the role these haulouts play in the annual cycle of seals. To do this, video material obtained using the DJI UAV Mavic 2 Zoom (takeoff weight 905 g) and Air 2 S (take-off weight 595 g), as well as long-term field observations were used. A complete survey of the coastline of all four islands was carried out on May 29(th) and 30(th), 2022 (at a water level of 456.40 m a.s.l.) and on August 12(th) and 24(th) (water level 456.79 and 456.83 m, respectively). Based on lithological characteristics, about 30% coastline on the Bolshoy Island, the largest one, is shown to be suitable for use by seals, but currently this is not the case. Among the three smaller islands, the most favorite place for the formation of seal haulouts is the Kruglyi Island, based on the total number of animals recorded on the island and in coastal waters, followed by the Tonkiy Island and then the Dolgiy Island, the latter supporting a stationary video system transmitting information online. On all islands, coordinates of specific haulout/rookery locations have been determined. Currently, about 35% length of the coastline of the three smaller Ushkan'y Islands are being used by seals for haulouts to one degree or another. Under current climatic conditions, the rookeries on the smaller Ushkan'y Islands seem to play extremely important roles for a significant part of the population (several thousand individuals visit them every season), since most other rookeries and locations that seals could use as such are highly susceptible to anthropogenic impacts.

Material on the Fauna and Ecology of Rotifers in the Urals, Family Synchaetidae (Rotifera, Eurotatoria, Ploima), Genus Polyarthra	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Data on the distribution of rotifers of the genus Polyarthra Ehrenberg, 1834, family Synchaetidae, in the Urals are summarized based on the author's research and an analysis of literature sources. Eight valid species have been detected: Polyarthra dolichoptera Idelson, 1925; P. euryptera Wierzejski, 1891; P. longiremis Carlin, 1943; P. luminosa Kutikova, 1962; P.major Burckhardt, 1900; P. minor Voigt, 1904; P. remata Skorikov, 1896; and P. vulgaris Carlin, 1943. The ninth of the recorded species, P. dissimulans Nipkow, 1952, may be referred to as a species inquirendum (Nogrady and Segers, 2002). Data on their localities, biology, bioindication, and quantitative development in the waters of the Urals are given. P. dolichoptera and P. vulgaris are most common and abundant in water bodies of the Urals. Low water temperatures probably limit the geographical distribution of the mainly thermophilic Polyarthra species to northern latitudes.

Geoinformational Analysis of NDVI in the Lake Baikal Basin	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												The unique status of Lake Baikal imposes special requirements on the state of ecosystems in its drainage basin. An assessment of vegetation cover change, one of the most important and most sensitive environmental indicators, is an urgent task in order to develop effective measures to prevent and mitigate the negative processes of land degradation in the transboundary territory of the Baikal Basin. The work used perennial composites of the NDVI vegetation index from 2000 to 2022; their long-term dynamics are analyzed. The results of geoinformation analysis of the NDVI and their trends by vegetation types are presented. In the Russian part of the basin, negative NDVI trends are observed for steppe communities, while positive trends are observed in Mongolia. The forest vegetation is characterized by the growth of NDVI. The contribution of the seasonal component to the overall NDVI trend is estimated. The most pronounced NDVI trends have a point distribution and are caused by both natural processes and anthropogenic impact.

However, most ditch-pond studies have been conducted in lowland areas. To test this source-sink assumption in upland areas, this study made observations on the ecological function of the ditch and pond system in a typical catchment in China. First, the changes in ponds in the catchment were analyzed using high-resolution remote sensing data. Then, the migration of agricultural pollutants in ditches and ponds were analyzed by field sampling and laboratory detection. The results showed that over the past 15 years the length of ditches in the catchment and the number of small ponds (< 500 m(2)) have increased by 32% and 75%, respectively. The rate of change in nutrient concentrations in the ditches and ponds were mostly from -20% to 20%, indicating ditches and ponds can be both sources and sinks for agricultural pollutants. Lastly, the contributing factors were explored and it was found that ditches and ponds are important sinks in dry season. However, during the rainy season, ditches and ponds become sources of pollutants, with the rapid drainage of ditches and the overflow of ponds in upland areas. The results of this study revealed that the ditches and ponds could be used for ecological engineering in upland catchments to balance drainage and intercept pollutants.

Due to various interventions (via drainage and/or irrigation channels, groundwater withdrawal with wells, agricultural activities, domes-tic wastes, etc.) in Seyfe Lake and its surroundings from 1960s to the present, natural functions of the lake have been deteriorated. As a result of the aforementioned actions and changes such as water elevation, shrinking lake surface area, decrease in volume and changes in surface temperature were observed in the lake. In this paper, the seasonal changes in the surface tem-perature distribution of Seyfe Lake were analyzed with the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) using multi-band Landsat satellite images from various years. In September 1990, the lake surface temperature varied between 10.94-24.14 degrees C while it varied between 12.36-26.67 degrees C in May 1990. In May 2020, the temperatures varied between 16.31-34.06 degrees C, and in Septem-ber 2020, it varied between 25.67-29.67 degrees C. When the lake surface temperature distribution was analyzed; it was determined that lower temperatures were observed in the northern parts, which are usually the deepest parts of the lake, while the temperature increased towards the central and coastal parts of the lake. However, it was seen that lake surface temperature has been affected by both climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities from the past to the present.

During the melt season, large amounts of surface meltwater access the bed through moulins, which sustain an efficient channelized subglacial system. Water pressure within these subglacial channels can be inferred by measuring the hydraulic head within moulins. However, moulin head data are rare, and subglacial hydrology models that simulate water pressure fluctuations require water storage in moulins or subglacial channels. Neither the volume nor the location of such water storage is currently well constrained. Here, we use the Moulin Shape (MouSh) model, which quantifies time-evolving englacial storage, coupled with a subglacial channel model to simulate head measurements from a small moulin in Pakitosq, western Greenland. We force the model with surface meltwater input calculated using field-acquired weather data. Our first-order simulations of moulin hydraulic head either overpredict the diurnal range of oscillation of the moulin head or require an unrealistically large moulin size to reproduce observed head oscillation ranges. We find that to accurately match field observations of moulin head, additional subglacial water must be added to the system. This subglacial baseflow is likely sourced from basal melt and nonlocal surface water inputs upstream. We hypothesize that the additional baseflow represents strong subglacial network connectivity throughout the channelized system and is consistent with our small moulin likely connecting to a higher-order subglacial channel.

Holocene limnological changes in saline and freshwater lakes, Lower Nhecolandia, Pantanal, Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The lower Nhecolandia region, in the south of the Pantanal, contains thousands of shallow freshwater and saline-alkaline lakes isolated by sandy ridges. To understand the paleoenvironment, sediment cores from B02SR (freshwater) and 07SR (saline-alkaline) lakes were analyzed, employing a combination of C-14 dating, microfossils, geochemical, elemental, and isotopic analyses. The 07SR core recovered Late Pleistocene sediments (similar to 23,440 cal yrs BP), and the B02SR core Middle Holocene sediments (similar to 6080 cal yrs BP). The base of the cores consists of bedded sands with no organic matter, sponge spicules, or diatoms. Phytoliths suggest the presence of cerrado vegetation with seasonal floods, suggestive of a periodically inundated distal floodplain. We interpret that the two lakes sustain perennial alkaline geochemical conditions between similar to 3080 and similar to 1330 cal yrs BP. The Lake B02SR transitioned to slightly acidic waters with low electrical conductivity from similar to 1330 cal yrs BP to the present, probably associated with a connection to ephemeral shallow or perennial channels. Lake 07SR maintained consistent water chemistry throughout the record, suggesting that an isolated drainage pattern remained unchanged creating persistent alkaline conditions. Our results suggest that lake chemical changes were spatially variable in lower Nhecolandia in the Holocene, which has implications for ecosystem services.					; Alves, Elton/M-3501-2019; Bendassolli, José/D-4919-2013; De Oliveira, Paulo Eduardo/B-4559-2017; Montes, Celia/E-5911-2012; Pessenda, Luiz/G-1776-2012; McGlue, Michael/C-9752-2014	Rasbold, Giliane Gessica/0000-0001-7375-6261; McGlue, Michael/0000-0002-0725-7250; De Oliveira, Paulo Eduardo/0000-0003-1040-4001; Montes, Celia Regina/0000-0002-5173-1909; Novais Alves, Elton Eduardo/0000-0001-7969-8330; Ruiz Pessenda, Luiz Carlos/0000-0001-9119-8195													0018-8158	1573-5117				2023 NOV 20	2023										10.1007/s10750-023-05411-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05411-3		NOV 2023											WOS:001106431100001

This research aimed at modelling sediment yield and quantifying heavy metals bound to the sediment. The study was conducted in the Lake Victoria's Inner Murchison Bay catchment in Uganda. Depth integrated suspended sediment sampling and discharge measurements were done at the outlets of Nakivubo and Ggaba sub-catchments for ten storm events during a wet season between March and May 2022. The sediment yields for the storms were computed using average suspended sediment concentrations and discharge retrieved from hydrographs. Corresponding event-based sediment yields were modelled using the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE). MUSLE model was calibrated and validated with observed sediment yields from Nakivubo and Ggaba sub-catchments respectively. Eighteen suspended sediment samples from the two sub-catchments were analysed for contamination by eight heavy metals. Results showed that the mean discharge and Suspened Sediment Concentration (SSC) were: 3.08 +/- 1.66 m3/s and 1238 +/- 665.6 mg/L; 0.495 +/- 0.41 m3/s and 1102 +/- 843.7 mg/L for Nakivubo and Ggaba respectively. MUSLE model performance indicators for calibration were: R2 of 0.94, NSE of 0.936 and PBIAS of -7.7 and for validation, R2 of 0.9, NSE of 0.57 and a PBIAS of -15.5. Thus, MUSLE proved a reliable tool for simulating event-wise sediment yield. Cadmium, Lead, and Zinc with contamination factors between 7-11, 1.9-4.1, and 0.9-1.7, respectively were the most prevalent heavy metals from both sub-catchments. Heavy metal pollution exhibited a linear relationship with suspended sediment concentration, with R2 values up to 0.958 and 0.82 in Nakivubo and Ggaba, respectively. The metal pollution in sediment carried into the bay, poses grave ecological and human health risks. Particularly, drinking water and fish sourced from the lake are susceptible to heavy metal contamination. Integrated catchment management practices that reduce sediment and heavy metal transport into Lake Victoria are an urgent requirement.					; Mantel, Sukhmani/AAY-4615-2020; Bamutaze, Yazidhi/Y-4060-2019; Kabenge, Isa/L-3500-2019; NAKAWUKA, PROSSIE/GXG-3651-2022; Gwapedza, David/AAI-1416-2020	Wanyama, Joshua/0000-0003-1799-4788; Gwapedza, David/0000-0002-4617-196X; 													2363-6203	2363-6211				APR	2024	10	2					1973	1991		10.1007/s40808-023-01876-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-023-01876-2		NOV 2023											WOS:001101662100001

In this study we summarize three lake sediment records that are uniquely located to test hypotheses regarding the importance of the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the last 5000 years. At Pigeon Marsh, Buck Pond, and Halls Pond, we used sedimentological (radiocarbon dating of transect cores), physical (grain size), geochemical (carbon and nitrogen ratios and isotopes), and biological (palynomorphs) proxies to reconstruct lake level and lake environment. Moderate lake and environmental changes occur around 2000 cal yr BP at Buck and Halls Pond, which is regionally consistent with other paleorecords and may suggest that the NAO was an important control. However, our results generally indicate fairly stable hydroclimate conditions up until historical European settlement when land clearance caused vegetational and lake hydrologic balance changes that were unprecedented in both magnitude and rate compared to the middle/late Holocene.

Through time series analysis of 9 GPS continuous stations in Dali, Yunnan, it is found that the vertical (U), north-south (N) and east-west (E) components of the relative motion have distinct annual and semi-annual period components. In the vertical direction, the U component has the strongest seasonal deformation characteristics, on the annual period term, between each station the correlation coefficient reaches 0.98, this is consistent with the relevant research results of many researchers; In horizontal direction, seasonal deformation is also more significant, the N component annual and semi-annual period signals are more obvious and the correlation coefficient is high, but the E component 9 stations signal are relatively scattered and poorly correlated. On the semi-annual period, the N and U directions have a very obvious and consistent semi-annual periodicity, and their two correlation coefficient numbers are 0.95 and 0.94 on average, respectively, the N and E are negatively correlated with a correlation coefficient of -0.98. In time series trend term, 9 stations show southeast movement in horizontal direction, but have great differences in vertical movement trend. Among them, YNLJ, YNYS, YNSD and YNLC are linear uplift movement with good consistency. YNYA, YNCX and YNJD show overall uplift movement, but with subsidence fluctuation, the trend of the three stations is very similar, with an average correlation coefficient reaches 0.8; XIAG station shows uplift movement as a whole, the relative motion trend in the E direction is very different from other stations in phase and amplitude, probably because it is closer to the Erhai lake and more susceptible to the influence of water level changes; YNYL also has different motion changes at different times, but the overall performance is subsidence motion. The analysis suggests that the GPS time series contains rich information on the seasonal deformation of the Earth's crust, and precipitation has an important role in influencing the seasonal deformation of continuous stations.

Seven dams were selected for water sampling and samples were collected monthly, including during the irrigation season for a period of one year from March to September 2019. The samples were analyzed for temperature, pH, physicochemical parameters such as temperature, pH value, salinity (EC), anions (CO3, HCO3, CI, SO4, P, NO3), cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg, B, NH4) and heavy metals. The irrigation suitability assessment was made using various indices such as SAR (sodium adsorption rate), TDS (total dissolved solids), Na% (sodium percentage), RSC (residual sodium bicarbonate), MAR (magnesium adsorption rate), KR (Kelly ratio), and PI (permeability index). The temperature values of the water samples varied between 5.8 degrees C -25.1 degrees C, pH and EC values changed between 7.51 and 8.46, 282, and 1400 mu S/cm respectively. The water samples were evaluated as C2S1 and C3S1 irrigation water classes. The heavy metal contents of the water samples were determined below the limit values. Selected dams were found suitable for irrigation in terms of EC (salinity), SAR (sodium adsorption rate), TDS (total dissolved solids), Na% (sodium percentage), RSC (residual sodium bicarbonate), MAR (magnesium adsorption rate), and KR (Kelly ratio). Water samples were determined as the second class of PI (permeability index). Gullubag dam was not found suitable as irrigation water in terms of EC, Na%, RSC, and KR values. As a result, it specifically points to the restrictions on the use of water from the Gullubag dam for irrigation purposes.																			1934-6344	1934-6352				NOV	2023	16	6					255	262		10.25165/j.ijabe.20231606.7725	http://dx.doi.org/10.25165/j.ijabe.20231606.7725													WOS:001178156300001

It is of good theoretical value to study seasonal water quality variation and driving factors in plateau lakes. This paper studied the variation of water quality parameters in different seasons and their relationship with land use and climate factors in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan Province from 2001 to 2019. The results show that the factors restricting water environment in different seasons are different, but basically close. The water quality parameters of multiple water quality monitoring stations in different seasons showed a decreasing or insignificant trend. In the rainy season, the temperature and precipitation were positively correlated with most water quality parameters, while the driving effect of climate factors was not significant in the dry season. Different land types have different effects on water quality indexes in different seasons. The water quality score was higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. The scores of water quality stations in the south and middle of Dianchi Lake are higher than those in the north. In this study, the relationship between climate, land, and water quality is established, which provides a way for the research of water quality parameters.

J	Ortloff, CR; Kolata, AL				Ortloff, Charles R.; Kolata, Alan L.			Fluid and Thermal Analysis of Pre-Columbian Tiwanaku (500-1100 CE) Raised-Field Agricultural Systems of Bolivia	WATER												Raised-field agricultural systems have received attention from scholars involved in the analysis of prehistoric agricultural intensification in the New World. This paper discusses the function of raised fields associated with the Tiwanaku society (500-1100 CE) located on the southern rim of Lake Titicaca in Bolivia. The overnight internal heat storage capacity of Tiwanaku raised-field berms located at the high-altitude (similar to 3810 masl) Bolivian altiplano is analyzed through ANSYS (version 4.2B) finite difference methods to provide an understanding of ancient agricultural engineers' knowledge regarding how to protect crops from nightly subzero freezing temperatures and water saturation. The present analysis concludes that enhanced berm heat storage capacity derived from solar radiation into multi-layered moist berm agricultural soils, together with radiative heating of berm-surrounding swale water (swale water depth determined from excavation into the groundwater aquifer), was an essential Tiwanaku design element of raised-field agriculture to protect crops from freezing damage during both wet and dry seasons. This paper reports the ANSYS temperature distribution results derived from a raised-field berm swale computer model of ancient excavated raised fields in the form of a 24 h heat input and cooling cycle, which indicates the presence of an internal berm heat storage effect designed to protect crops from freezing damage. The calculations performed use specific hydrological and climatological conditions characteristic of the littoral and near-shore environment of Lake Titicaca. The use of the ANSYS finite element code to investigate the source of internal berm heat storage protecting crops from freezing temperatures, compared to the field test results from experimental use of reconstructed ancient, raised fields, provides an understanding of the technologies developed by Tiwanaku agricultural engineers to increase raised-field agricultural production.																				2073-4441				NOV	2023	15	21							3845	10.3390/w15213845	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15213845													WOS:001103359300001

Indeed, to better assess "Nyos-type lakes" related hazards, paleolimnology offers a promising tool to trace the evidence of potential ancient Nyos-type gas explosions. After gas bursts from Lakes Monoun and Nyos in 1984 and 1986, respectively, multiple paleolimnological approaches have been applied to several lakes assumed to be Nyos-type Around the world,. Only 3 lakes in Europe (i.e. lakes Pavin in France, Albano and Monticchio in Italy and one in Africa (i.e. Lake Kivu in D.R. Congo) evidenced markers of limnic eruptions in their sedimentary archives. These features include reworked sediments with reversed ages, brown colors of sedimentary deposits, gas-rich sediments, iron hydroxide-rich sediments, strong Ti and Fe enrichments, sedimentary hiatuses, absence of seismic evidence in the sedimentary record, and significant change in geochemical signature. The dating of these sedimentary deposits has made it possible to determine the ages of the events and their recurrence. This has led to associating these markers with evidence of limnic eruptions, even though some lakes are in temperate climates that favor seasonal overturning of lake waters and thus gradual release of accumulated gas. There is still no agreement on the dynamics and causes, and the scientific debate remains open since there is no concrete reference event in historical time. Lakes Monoun and Nyos, the first and only lakes exploded in recent history, could therefore be considered as natural laboratories to better understand limnic eruptions in lakes around the world. Unfortunately, the well-studied aspects of these Cameroonian "killer lakes" are based more on the dynamics of the explosions, hazard assessment based on water chemistry, and gas releases, rather than on the possible similar behavior in the recent geologic past by applying a combination of old and new limnological approaches. In addition, as the first natural laboratory, Lake Monoun features several advantages, including smaller surface area, shallower depth favorable for coring, easy access, and negligible gas content after artificial degassing since the early 2000s.

However, the coexistence of bacteria with the smallest phytoplankton groups is mostly unknown. Here, the associated bacteria (AB) of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) in the Yangtze-connected Lake Dongting were studied using flow cytometry sorting combined with high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene throughout the seasonal cycle. Bacteria in the corresponding whole water (WWB) were also investigated for comparison. Our results revealed a distinct bacterial community of AB compared to WWB. The taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity indices, as well as the richness, of AB were significantly lower than those of WWB; however, AB showed higher Pielou's evenness. Proteobacteria (53.8%) was the most abundant phylum in AB, whereas Actinobacteria was predominant in WWB (36.0%). Several abundant clades, including Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rheinheimera, Novosphingobium, and Sphingomonas, were significantly enriched in AB. Functional prediction analysis identified 116 KEGG pathways differing significantly between AB and WWB. Particularly, functional properties involved in cellular processes (mainly bacterial chemotaxis), environmental information processing, organismal systems and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were greatly enriched in AB. Total nitrogen, temperature and chlorophyll a correlated significantly with the community dissimilarity between AB and WWB. Our results shed new light on the bacterial diversity and function associated with the smallest phytoplankton.

Specific cultural wealth generally arises from the local wisdom of a community - the floating House in South Sulawesi, which has existed for half a century. The floating House originally served as a shelter during the fishing season but has developed into a homestay for local and foreign tourists. The development process is unique, and it's interesting to know the type of floating House and the spatial configuration based on local wisdom. The research method analyzes the Typology of floating houses, changes in the configuration of floating homes, and the survival of floating houses using architectural and spatial ethno. Results of the Floating House Research are the development of a Kalumpang, a house where you work and take shelter on the lake during low tide during the fishing season. Its characteristics are the productive houses of Lake Tempe fishermen, who are dynamic, and their configuration moves in groups according to the tidal conditions of the lake. The orientation of the floating houses changes depending on the wind direction. The position of the floating houses depends on the distance to the fishing location and kinship.

J	Mondal, A; Banerjee, S				Mondal, Arpita; Banerjee, Sandip			Impact of critical eddy diffusivity on seasonal bloom dynamics of Phytoplankton in a global set of aquatic environments	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The intensity of eddy diffusivity and the spatial average of water velocity at the depths of the water column in oceans and lakes play a fundamental role in phytoplankton production and phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass, and community composition. The critical depth and intensity of turbulent mixing within the water column profoundly affect phytoplankton biomass, which depends on the sinking characteristic of planktonic algal species. We propose an Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ) model in 3D space with light and nutrient-limited growth in a micro-scale ecological study. To incorporate micro-scale observation of phytoplankton intermittency in bloom mechanism in stationary as well as oceanic turbulent flows, a moment closure method has been applied in this study. Experimental observations imply that an increase in turbulence is sometimes ecologically advantageous for non-motile planktonic algae. How do we ensure whether there will be a bloom cycle or whether there can be any bloom at all when the existing phytoplankton group is buoyant, heavier, motile, or non-motile? To address these questions, we have explored the effects of critical depth, the intensity of eddy diffusivity, spatial average of water velocity, on the concentration as well as horizontal and vertical distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass using a mathematical model and moment closure technique. We quantify a critical threshold value of eddy diffusivity and the spatial average of water velocity and observe the corresponding changes in the phytoplankton bloom dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of eddy diffusivity and the spatial average of water velocity on seasonal bloom dynamics and also mimic different real-life bloom scenarios in Mikawa Bay (Japan), Tokyo Bay (Japan), Arakawa River (Japan), the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf Alaska, the North Arabian Sea, the Cantabrian Sea, Lake Nieuwe Meer (Netherlands) and several shallower lakes.

J	Hashimoto, S				Hashimoto, Shinji			Metabolic balance in the euphotic layer of Lake Sagami, Japan	LIMNOLOGY												In all ecosystems, metabolism is an essential process that controls the biogeochemical carbon cycle through the fixation and mineralization of organic matter. However, the ecological metabolic balance in the semi-riverine and eutrophic reservoir remains poorly understood. In this study, seasonal variations in gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP-ER), chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, and zooplankton abundance were investigated within the euphotic layer of Lake Sagami from May to December both in 2016 and 2017. The Chl a concentration, GPP, ER, and NEP integrated vertically in the euphotic layer varied in the range of 0.7-92.4 mg m-3, 0.3-221.4, 0.6-59.2, -43.5-202 mmol O2 m-3 d-1, respectively. A significant positive linear relationship was observed between the GPP and NEP. The threshold GPP, where GPP equals ER, was 15.6 mmol O2 m-3 d-1, which is very low compared to the values in other eutrophic lakes. As no significant relationship was found between Chl a concentration, GPP and zooplankton abundance, it is possible that most zooplankton feed on allochthonous organic matter rather than autochthonous organic matter. Furthermore, no significant relationship was observed between the ER and zooplankton abundance, suggesting that the ER represents the activity of heterotrophic communities other than zooplankton. The ER was positively correlated with the water temperature. The variation in ER in Lake Sagami is most likely influenced by water temperature rather than particulate organic matter.

The data were collected in the framework of a monitoring program finalized to assess the presence of pollutants in the lake biota, including zooplankton organisms directly preyed by fish. The data report both concentration of DDTtot and sumPCB(14 )in the zooplankton and the standing stock density and biomass of the population in each season. The dataset allows for detecting changes in the concentration over the long term and within a year, thus providing evidence for the seasonal and the plurennial variations in the presence of these pollutants in the lake. They also provide a basis for further studies aimed at modeling paths and the fate of persistent organic pollutants, for which the amount of toxicants stocked in the zooplankton compartment linked to fish is a crucial estimate.Dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8109373Dataset License: CC-BY 4.0					; Quadroni, Silvia/T-1972-2019; Boldrocchi, Ginevra/KSM-8483-2024; Bettinetti, Roberta/AAD-7072-2019	Bettinetti, Roberta/0000-0001-7481-6190; Boldrocchi, Ginevra/0000-0002-6827-4687; DOSSI, CARLO/0000-0001-7355-0140; Piscia, Roberta/0000-0003-3123-7759; Villa, Benedetta/0009-0009-0004-8403														2306-5729				OCT	2023	8	10							152	10.3390/data8100152	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/data8100152													WOS:001096598900001
J	Toruan, RL; Lukman, L; Coggins, LX; Ghadouani, A				Toruan, Reliana Lumban; Lukman, Lukman; Coggins, Liah X.; Ghadouani, Anas			Zooplankton size-structure dynamics of a lowland tropical floodplain lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Floodplains are highly complex ecosystems representing high biodiversity and conservation values, but they are also one of the world's most threatened ecosystems due to extensive development and anthropogenic activities. Lake Tempe is a lowland riverine floodplain lake in Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, that is subject to multiple stressors such as flow alteration, eutrophication and invasive species. In this study, the dynamics of the zooplankton community size structure was investigated in Lake Tempe. Five size-based metrics, including zooplankton mean body size, total abundance, total, biomass, and normalised biomass size spectra (NBSS) slope and intercept were assessed from net-sampled zooplankton collected monthly from March to December 2016, and the role of environmental variables in shaping these size-based metrics were also examined. Zooplankton community size structure is a useful metric as it is less labour intensive than traditional approaches, provides more data accuracy and does not require highly specialised taxonomic expertise. The zooplankton community in Lake Tempe was characterised by high density of small-sized zooplankton with an average mean body size < 500 & mu;m equivalent spherical diameter. While the zooplankton density was characterised by the dominance of the size class 300-700 & mu;m, there was evidence of a significant contribution of the size > 700 & mu;m towards total biomass. Seasonal hydrological regimes, water temperature and eutrophication parameters, as indicated by total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentration, had a significant role in driving the variability of zooplankton community size structure in this system. The results of this study are not only a significant step in providing critical baseline information on the zooplankton assemblage of Lake Tempe, but is also a significant contribution to the overall understanding of zooplankton community structure in tropical lakes, and will aid in improving lake management plans in these regions.

J	Harrison, T; Su, DF; Fillion, EN; Kwekason, A				Harrison, Terry; Su, Denise F.; Fillion, Elizabeth N.; Kwekason, Amandus			Early Pliocene fauna from the Lower Laetolil Beds, Laetoli, Tanzania	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY												The mid-Pliocene Upper Laetolil Beds at Laetoli in northern Tanzania have produced a rich diversity of fossil vertebrates, including the remains and traces of the early hominin, Australopithecus afarensis. The fauna from the older Lower Laetolil Beds, dating from 3.8Ma to older than 4.3Ma, has not previously been the subject of detailed analysis. This study, based on renewed palaeontological investigations, provides the first systematic account of the fauna, along with a brief synthesis of the geology and palaeoecology. Forty species of mammals are recorded from the Lower Laetolil Beds, dominated by bovids, equids, rhinocerotids, and proboscideans, in addition to reptiles, birds, and invertebrates. The mammal fauna is very similar to that from the Upper Laetolil Beds, and to a lesser extent to the Upper Ndolanya Beds, indicating a high degree of faunal continuity and provinciality in the Laetoli area during much of the Pliocene. Evidence indicates that the palaeoecology of the Lower Laetolil Beds was predominantly dry open woodlands-shrublands-grasslands, but dense woodlands and forests were present on the lower slopes of the nearby Satiman volcano. Water was more abundant than in the Upper Laetolil Beds, with seasonal rivers, marshes and shallow lakes bordered by riparian woodland.

COVID myocarditis in a collegiate athlete: Timeline and return to play	AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL PLUS: CARDIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE												Background: Studies in collegiate athletes have demonstrated a prevalence of cardiac involvement between 0.5 and 3 % after SARS-CoV-2 infection. When post-COVID cardiac involvement occurs in athletes, the ideal return to play timeline and many possible long-term sequela or complications are unknown.Case summary: A 20 yo female collegiate athlete tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and underwent routine cardiac screening prior to her return to play (RTP). Evaluation demonstrated an elevated high-sensitivity troponin-I and an ECG showed some mild T wave changes. She had a normal transthoracic echocardiogram, and her Cardiac magnetic imaging (CMR) met Lake Louise Criteria for acute myocarditis. She was diagnosed with acute myocarditis and restricted from sports. CMR was repeated at 3.5 months after normalization of troponin I HS and demonstrated continued active inflammation. She continued to be restricted from exertion. A third CMR was obtained at 6.5 months and showed resolution of active inflammation but a small area of fibrosis, and the remainder of her cardiac testing was normal. She was allowed to slowly progress back into sport and returned to competition at 9 months and successfully completed her season.Discussion: CMR is not typically repeated prior to RTP after a diagnosis of myocarditis in athletes, but in this case, repeat CMR at 3.5 months initially demonstrated continued active inflammation, and a second repeat CMR at 6.5 months demonstrated abnormal cardiac fibrosis. This may suggest utility in repeating CMR and raises questions about possible long-term implications of cardiac fibrosis once the acute inflammation of myocarditis has resolved.																				2666-6022				OCT	2023	34								100323	10.1016/j.ahjo.2023.100323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ahjo.2023.100323		SEP 2023						38510953					WOS:001133891200001

This situation is especially true in the Yangtze River Floodplain, China. However, few researches have been focused on differences in the spatial and temporal patterns of benthic macroinvertebrates assemblages between the two adjacent lakes in this floodplain. In this study, we conducted seasonal investigations in 2021 to compare the spatial and temporal patterns of macroinvertebrates in Lakes Taihu and Lake Chaohu. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses showed Lake Taihu was found to have differences in assemblages within the lake, but Lake Chaohu was found to have uniform assemblage across the entire lake. Macrophyte-dominated lake regions (eastern Lake Taihu) were characterised by the highest species richness and diversity indices than those in other lake regions. The pollution sensitive species (e.g. EPT: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were only distributed in the macrophytic areas of Lake Taihu. Corbicula fluminea, polychaetes Nephtys oligobranchia and Capitella sp. were dominant in the middle central lake regions in Lake Taihu. Lake Chaohu and the northern Lake Taihu, with turbid algal-dominated state, were characterised by dominance of Oligochaetes and Chironomids. These differences were attributed to varying habitats and environmental parameters among different lake regions. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) demonstrated that macrophytes, chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), temperature, ammonium (NH3-N) and electric conductivity (EC) were detected as important factors influencing such macroinvertebrate assemblage patterns between these two lakes. This study contributes to the scientific knowledge of within lake habitats, community assemblages, nutrients and pollution within these lakes.

J	Çelekli, A; Lekesiz, Ö				Celekli, Abuzer; Lekesiz, Omer			Assessing relationships between environmental stress and benthic diatoms in lentic habitats in the western Mediterranean basin (Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Hydrological (rainy and dry) periods can affect the water quality of lentic ecosystems, which may be useful for understanding their ecological condition in the watershed. Ecological status of various lentic ecosytems (both brackish and freshwater) in the western Mediterranean basin was evaluated by using various diatom metrics throughout rainy (May) and dry (August and October) periods to explain the diatom-stressor interactions using multivariate approaches. Canonical correspondence analysis separated freshwater habitats under the pressures of nitrate and total organic carbon from brackish ecosystems under the pressures of conductivity, nitrite, sulphate, calcium, and copper, which were characterized by different phytoplankton species. Ecological integrations of diatom species varied in the ecosystems throughout rainy and dry periods. Different ecological regional diatom indices were used to find the best index/indices indicating the ecological status of lakes and reservoirs in the basin during the two hydrological periods. The trophic diatom index developed for lakes was not found to be suitable for assessing lentic habitats. European diatom indices generally showed the distinction in the assessment of these ecosystems in the rainy and dry seasons, but others could not. Among the diatom indices, only the trophic index Turkey (TIT) showed a statistically significant correlation with TP. The TIT not only showed degradation of the water quality of ecosystems during the dry season compared to the rainy season, but it has also been successful in distinguishing the ecological conditions of lentic ecosystems.

In the current study, we investigated calving site selection and vigilance behaviour during delivery and nursing in migratory female Tibetan antelopes at Zonag Lake. According to observations and analysis, the females were distributed south of Zonag Lake, where vegetation was abundant. We determined their dates of migration (crossing the Qinghai-Tibet Highway observation site), showing a shift of one month during the period from June in 2008 to May 2021. Results also showed that 81.4% of females expressed high vigilance behaviour during calving and nursing compared to those without calves (7.1%). From delivery until calf standing, females were highly vigilant and spent considerable time scanning, with 96% of females showing vigilance behaviour. Females with calves (average 9.94 & PLUSMN; 0.62 s) spent more time on vigilance behaviour than females without calves (average 6.25 & PLUSMN; 1.38 s). Females with newborns spent the greatest amount of time being vigilant (average 51.63 & PLUSMN; 4.24 s). These results not only identify basic Tibetan antelope calving behaviour, but also provide scientific analysis and evidence for further ethological research on female Tibetan antelopes.					yang, dongdong/IUO-5278-2023; xu, wei/JZD-2112-2024; Wu, Xiaomin/Q-1526-2015														1314-2836	1314-2828				SEP 5	2023	11								e107957	10.3897/BDJ.11.e107957	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.11.e107957								37711367					WOS:001072396800001

Major physicochemical parameters have been measured and findings revealed that numerous parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), phosphate, fluoride, and total iron concentrations in many of the river waters exceeded the permissible limits/standards given by national and international regulatory organizations. Anthropogenic suitability of water was also evaluated based on their water quality index (WQI), comprehensive pollution index (CPI), and irrigation indices. Based on the WQI, all of the river waters were found to be unfit for drinking during both PM and PoM seasons, while CPI evaluation revealed river water pollution levels from slightly polluted to heavily polluted. Thongjaorok River exhibited the highest WQI and CPI values during both seasons, indicating the greatest pollution load in this river. Evaluation of irrigation water quality using indices such as sodium percentage, Sodium Adsorption Ratio, Residual Sodium Carbonate, Kelly's ratio indicated that water from all the rivers could be used safely for irrigational purposes. Geochemical evaluation revealed rock-weathering as the dominant geochemical process governing the ion chemistry of the feeder river waters, whereas water type in most rivers were of HCO3-Ca type during PM season, while changes to Cl-Na type and mixed type were observed in some rivers during PoM season.					; Laishram, Ranu/JDM-5106-2023	Alam, Wazir/0000-0002-6043-7795; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2023	234	9							610	10.1007/s11270-023-06621-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-023-06621-0													WOS:001188371800001

Prey availability and foraging activity by tundra-nesting sea ducks: Strong preference for specific wetland types	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Wetlands in Arctic tundra support abundant breeding waterbirds. Wetland types differing in area, depth, vegetation, and invertebrate biomass density may vary in importance to birds, and in vulnerability to climate change. We studied availability and use of different wetland types by prelaying females of four species of sea ducks (Mergini) breeding on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska, USA: long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) and Steller's (Polysticta stelleri), spectacled (Somateria fischeri), and king eiders (Somateria spectabilis). All four species preferred shallow vegetated wetlands versus deeper lakes. The ducks spent almost all their active time feeding, but their occurrence in different wetland types was not affected by the relative biomass density of known prey or of all invertebrates that we sampled combined. Sea ducks strongly preferred wetlands dominated by emergent and submersed Arctophila fulva over those dominated by the sedge Carex aquatilis, despite the much greater number, total area, and invertebrate biomass density of Carex wetlands. The hens depend heavily on local invertebrate prey for protein to produce eggs; thus, their preference for Arctophila wetlands likely reflects greater accessibility of prey in the near-surface canopy and detritus of Arctophila. Such shallow wetlands decreased substantially in number (-17%) and area (-30%) over 62 years before 2013 and appear highly susceptible to further declines with climate warming. Impacts on sea ducks of climate-driven changes in availability of important wetland types will depend on their adaptability in exploiting alternative wetlands. Sea ducks rely on food from tundra wetlands during the breeding season. We compared patterns of wetland use by female sea ducks of four species to the availability of different wetland types wetlands and prey, as well as behaviors of sea ducks within these wetlands. Wetlands of most apparent value comprise a small fraction of wetland area, and have moderate invertebrate prey biomass densities, but are highly selected for by female sea ducks.image						Miller, Micah/0000-0002-2453-8388													2045-7758					SEP	2023	13	9							e10375	10.1002/ece3.10375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10375								37745786					WOS:001068230700001

Diatom diversity and species composition in phytoplankton, sediment traps, and surface sediments from a warm monomictic tropical lake	HIDROBIOLOGICA												Background: Diatom assemblages in sediments are frequently used as water quality and paleoenvironmental indicators. However, sedimentary diatom assemblages may present taphonomic biases due to processes occurring in the water column and water-sediment interface. Objective: The present study aimed to determine if in tropical deep lakes, the differences between water column, sediment trap and surface sediment samplings were large enough to provide antagonistic interpretations. It also aimed to determine if diversity metrics would be statistically different between the three kinds of samples. Methods: This study was performed in Lake Alberca de Tacambaro, Michoacan, Mexico, and involved the comparison of diatom species composition and diversity between phytoplankton, sediment trap and surface sediment samplings. Results: Nearly 80% of the diatom species, including the five most abundant taxa, were present in the three kinds of samples. Phytoplankton and sediment trap samplings documented the seasonal dynamics and indicated that the changes in species composition and diversity metrics were associated with the mixing and stratification processes of the water column. Unexpectedly, phytoplankton and sediment trap samples had relatively high percentages (ca. 20%) of benthic taxa (Achnanthidium minutissimum and Brachysira vitrea), which behaved as tychoplanktonic. Surface sediment samples showed a higher species richness and Simpson's diversity, but the three kinds of samples had similar Shannon diversities. Conclusions: In spite of the differences between the sampling methods, they did not provide antagonistic results on the condition of the lake. Surface sediment samples showed richer and more equitable assemblages, including diatoms from different habits, with an average-time window of about two years. The discrepancies between the phytoplankton and surface sediment diatom assemblages are an indication of recent changes in the diatom flora of this lake.

However, these ecosystems are rare and unstable on the Guianas coast because of sediment dynamics. Nonetheless, they host 2 shorebirds that breed in the Nearctic and the Neotropic: Wilson's Plover (Charadrius wilsonia) and Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus). We studied their breeding biology in the Amana Nature Reserve, a Ramsar Site in French Guiana, on sandy beaches bordered by brackish lagoons during 1 breeding season. From early June to late August 2008, we located and monitored 19 Wilson's Plover and 15 Black-necked Stilt nests. Most nests were associated with bare ground. While stilts preferred to build their nests with twigs closer to lagoons, plovers did not show any preference in nest location and composition. For plovers and stilts, clutch sizes were 2-3 eggs or 3- 4 eggs per nest, respectively, and the mean egg volumes were 12.1 +/- 0.4 cm(3) and 20.6 +/- 0.6 cm(3), respectively. The apparent hatching success for both species was low, 11% for Wilson's Plover and 13% for Black-necked Stilt, whereas daily nest survival was high for both species. Clutch sizes, egg dimensions, and egg colorations were comparable to those described elsewhere, but the breeding season started later than at other localities for the Wilson's Plover. In French Guiana, the apparent nest success values for both species were much lower than those reported in the United States and the West Indies but seemed slightly higher than in Brazil. Human activity impacts were limited in our study area and did not explain the low nest success values found. Beach flooding at high tide was the main cause of clutch failure, followed by predation. Ironically, flooding allows the maintenance of this low, open, and debris-covered habitat used by beach-nesting shorebirds. Received 28 September 2022. Accepted 11 August 2023.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of the deposition of effluents from a pig farm on the phytoplankton assemblage composition and limnological parameters at different spots of the Divisa River - Fazenda Sao Luis, Aparecida de Minas/MG, Brazil. Over six months, we analyzed several variables at three different sampling sites on the surface of a coastal zone. We registered seventy-four phytoplankton genera, with Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae representing the most abundant classes, and Cryptophyceae and Cyanophyceae displaying the highest densities. The PERMANOVA analysis revealed dissimilarity between sampling sites P1 x P3 and P2 x P3, and the SIMPER analysis showed that Cryptophyceae and Cyanophyceae contributed to the observed dissimilarity. The correspondence canonical analysis (CCA) allowed the organization of sampled sites in three groups, in which the phytoplankton composition was distinguished according to trophic gradients. We concluded that pig farming effluents discharged without previous treatment into water bodies exert influences in both the phytoplankton community and the dynamics of its assemblage, by increasing total phosphorus and contributing for increased abundances of Cryptophyceae and Cyanophyceae in the last evaluated site (P3).

This research firstly investigated distribution and cancer risk of 7 parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 19 H-PAHs in Songhua river and Songhua lake of Jilin city, China. The results indicate that 7 parent PAHs and 12 H-PAHs were coexisted. The total concentrations of PAHs, Cl-PAHs, and Br-PAHs respectively ranged from 75.6 to 323.33 with a median concentration of 164.48 ng/L, n.d. to 45.87 with a median concentration of 2.19 ng/L, and n.d. to 56.93 ng/L with a median concentration of 4.67 ng/L. The seasonal variation was obvious; the highest total concentrations of PAHs and H-PAHs were occurred in melt season, which suggests that melting snow and riverine input were major sources of PAHs and H-PAHs. For cancer risk, the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) values of PAHs and HPAHs for all the sampling sites and water seasons were lower than 1.00E-06, suggesting that the cancer risk of these compounds were low, while the cancer risk may be underestimated due to a lack of toxicity data for some H-PAHs.					sun, caiyun/LKL-3227-2024; Xia, Yu/HIR-6944-2022	Xia, Yu/0000-0002-3253-2883													0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2023	234	9							605	10.1007/s11270-023-06632-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-023-06632-x													WOS:001066495400001

Concerning its restricted distribution and endangered conservation status, we aimed to forecast its current and future suitable habitats as well as distribution shifts for 2050 and 2080. The Maxent model with different scenarios (representative concentration pathway 4.5 and representative concentration pathway 8.5) was used to analyze 113 georeferenced records of F. dagana using 19 bioclimatic factors from the WorldClim database. As a result, the amount and variance of precipitation and temperature, together with elevation, were shown to be the most significant factors affecting the species' distribution. In particular, precipitation during the plant growing season had the greatest impact (55.2% variability) on the species distribution. Climate change was expected to cause a minor shift in the distribution of suitable habitats toward the north and an increase in habitat continuity, indicating that the climate will become more favorable for the growth of species and in the future. The species' highly suitable area will remain primarily concentrated in its current potential distribution area in central Siberia (around Lake Baikal). The species' conservation status was determined to be near threatened, emphasizing the great relevance of facilitating proper conservation measures for F. dagana.(c) 2023 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA), Publishing Services by Elsevier.

Our survey revealed that six types of fishing gear were used: standing traps, fyke nets, fish aggregating devices, seabass net cages, small traps and stationary lift nets. The type of fishing gear used depended on the depth of water. The density of installed standing traps reached a maximum of 357 traps/km2, which was the highest density of any fishing gear installed on the lake. They were mainly set in the middle part of the lake, where the water was less than 2 m deep. Sedimentation was examined inside and outside the areas infiuenced by standing traps. Sediment samples were collected with sediment traps in the northeast and southwest monsoon seasons. Sedimentation rates inside and outside the areas infiuenced by standing traps differed at some sites but the pattern was not consistent across seasons. Sedimentation rates were higher in the northeast monsoon season with the average rate 1132.32 & PLUSMN; 43.73 (mean & PLUSMN; SE) g m  2day  1 when precipitation and run-off were higher and 323.98 & PLUSMN; 10.68 g m  2day  1 in the southwest monsoon or dry season. Moreover, the proportion of finer clay particles was greater in the sediment from the areas infiuenced by traps. Benthic mac-roinvertebrate communities between the two areas were different. A bivalve, Potamocorbula sp., which domi-nated benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, had a higher abundance in areas infiuenced by traps. The effects of stationary fishing gears on sedimentation and benthic macroinvertebrates highlighted in this study suggest that the long-term deployment of these gears may affect food chain dynamics in this lagoon system. Ultimately, a proper regulation of the use of these gears may be needed.

For this study, a water level gauge was installed at the main station at Etoud, four discharge measurements representing the seasons were carried out and water samples were collected. The maximum liquid discharge to the Lake Mefou was 3.92 m(3)/s observed during the long rainy season, while the minimum observed during the long dry season was 0.58 m(3)/s. Meanwhile, the maximum solid discharge to the Lake Mefou observed during the short rainy season was 598.8 mg/s and the minimum of 14.85 mg/s was observed in June during the short dry season. It is then evident that the amount of suspended sediments in the river is not proportional to the flow rate. The mobilization of solid particles in the watershed resulted in an annual total flux of 5.74 T/year into the lake reservoir. This result is not yet alarming for the reservoir lifespan but testify to the permanent activity of erosion in this environment caused by the combination of various natural and anthropogenic processes such as climate change and land use activities.

Starting from the study of the mechanism of NPS, taking the Yangliu small watershed in the Shaanxi section of the Hanjiang River Basin in China as an example, and based on the combination of measured data and models, this paper focused on the analysis of the characteristics of NPS between the runoff plot and small watershed. The results showed that with the rainfall and surface runoff, the nutrient concentration increased first and then decreased, and the highest occurred in the first half of the whole rainfall process. Rainfall, maximum rainfall intensity at 60 min (I-60), runoff, and suspended sediment (SS) were all related to nutrient diversion loss. However, the correlation among rainfall, I-60, and runoff and the content of various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus were significantly higher than that of SS. Crop interplanting and terrace planting could play a significant role in reducing sediment and nutrient loss. For the analysis of NPS pollution in small watersheds, the time-variant gain model (TVGM) was used to simulate the missing flow in some months of the basin during the flood season. The average concentration method was used to calculate the NPS pollution load in flood season. It was found that total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) accounted for more than 92% and 69%, respectively. This study is expected to provide scientific basis for NPS pollution control in areas both regionally and worldwide.																			0733-9372	1943-7870				AUG 1	2023	149	8							04023037	10.1061/JOEEDU.EEENG-7261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/JOEEDU.EEENG-7261													WOS:001011044600006

A total of 754 fish specimens were collected from October 2020 to August 2021. Total length and weight were measured and sexes were identified and gonad maturity levels were recorded. The sex ratio of African catfish in different size classes was similar to that of a hypothetical 1:1 ratio. The length at first maturity ( L50) was 51.8 cm in total length. The mean Fulton's condition factor of female African catfish ranged from 0.65 +/- 0.05 - 0.71 +/- 0.14, while the males ranged from 0.62 +/- 0.04 - 0.7 +/- 0.11. The Fulton's condition factor was significantly higher in August for females than in the rest of the sampling months. The highest ripe gonads were recorded in the rainy season and the lowest was in the dry season, with the percentage of ripe gonads being 27.5%, while the males showed similarly extended maturity patterns among seasons. Fisheries management for African catfish should therefore take into account the estimated L50 value and the main breeding season to sustain the fishery and benefits the fishermen.

The rate at which carcasses are covered is a key to their preservation. Because of the growth rate of microbial mats depends on environmental conditions, a set of experiments have been carried out emulating the Barremian environmental conditions, analysed for temperatures at 14 & DEG;C and 26 & DEG;C (cooler and warmer seasons respectively) and atmospheric pCO(2) (1000 ppm). For this purpose, the microbial mats were grown in mesocosms within an environmental chamber. Variations in primary production were quantified by measuring changes in dissolved O2 concentration in the water. Zebrafish carcasses were laid on the mats, and their coverage rates were calculated from the daily surface area covered by the mat. The results showed that the fish was covered twice as fast at 26 & DEG;C, in coincidence with the highest values for the gross primary production and community respiration of the microbial mats. Therefore, for these Barremian conditions, the early stages of carcasses preservation would take place most effectively during the warmer seasons as decomposing activity would release nutrients that would enhance, together with temperature, the growth of mats.					; Alcorlo, Paloma/L-7131-2014; Buscalioni, Angela/AAA-5874-2019	Lopez Archilla, Ana Isabel/0000-0002-3673-6189; Molla Martinez, Salvador/0000-0001-5769-139X; Alcorlo Pages, Paloma/0000-0002-0048-0038; Delgado Buscalioni, Angela/0000-0003-1598-7963													0891-2963	1029-2381				OCT 2	2024	36	10					2009	2018		10.1080/08912963.2023.2238745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08912963.2023.2238745		JUL 2023											WOS:001033945300001
J	Hill, T; Dow, CF				Hill, Tim; Dow, Christine F.			The impact of surface melt rate and catchment characteristics on Greenland Ice Sheet moulin inputs	CRYOSPHERE												The supraglacial drainage system of the Greenland Ice Sheet, in combination with surface melt rate, controls the rate of water flow into moulins, a major driver of subglacial water pressure. We apply the Subaerial Drainage System (SaDS) model, a physically based surface meltwater flow model, to a similar to 20x27km(2) catchment on the southwestern Greenland Ice Sheet for 4 years of melt forcing (2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016) to (1) examine the relationship between surface melt rate and the rate, diurnal amplitude, and timing of surface inputs to moulins; (2) compare SaDS to contemporary models; and (3) present a framework for selecting appropriate supraglacial drainage models for different modelling objectives. We find that variations in the rate and timing of modelled moulin inputs related to the development of supraglacial channels are relatively more important in years with low melt volumes than years with high melt volumes. We suggest that a process-resolving supraglacial hydrology model (e.g., SaDS) should be considered when modelling outcomes are sensitive to subdiurnal and long-term seasonal changes in the rate of discharge into moulins.

In this study, the effects of genetic variation of the macrophyte species on periphyton biomass were studied in five submerged species. A two-year mesocosm study was conducted with four levels of genetic diversity (1, 4, 8 and 16 genotypes) for each submerged macrophyte, including 1600 individuals and 320 boxes in 20 mesocosms. Of the five submerged species, only Vallisneria spinulosa showed a positive correlation between its levels of genotype richness and the periphyton biomass. The correlation between genetic distance of genotypes and periphyton biomass was tested, which varied with the difference of seasons and species. In summary, we found that in freshwater mesocosms, the genetic diversity of submerged macrophytes may play a role in regulating the periphyton biomass, but the interaction between genetic diversity of macrophytes and periphyton biomass was not straightforward. This study will provide new insights into the interaction dynamics between the two primary producers in shallow lakes.

The species has been listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds. We observed the colonies of Caspian terns repeatedly in the breeding season from May to June on the islands of Lake Chany from 1985 to 2011. We recorded clutch size, eggshell coloration and measured egg length and width to the nearest 0.1 mm with a caliper. Furthermore, we recorded the fate and hatching date of individual eggs and determined the clutch initiation date. Head, bill, tarsus length, and body weight of newly hatched chicks were measured. Caspian tern colony size changed between years from 50 nests in 1985 to 513 in 1999; therefore, the sample size of measured eggs varied from 90 to 1045. A total of 4137 eggs and 570 chicks were measured. We provide new information for this species nesting in west Siberia, which is important to compare with other local results. The presented data set is a novel long-term data set on an isolated population of this species in center of Eurasian continent.

J	Cerma, L; Yu, PQ				Cerma, Linda; Yu, Peiqiang			Effect of thermal processing methods on structural, physicochemical and nutritional characteristics of cool-season chickpeas in ruminant systems	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The focus of this study was to evaluate the effect of thermal processing methods: Dry Heat, Wet Heat (Autoclave) and Microwave Irradiation on newly developed cool-season adapted CDC chickpeas as an alternative source for protein and energy for ruminant. Three varieties of chickpeas, developed and provided by the Crop Development Center (CDC), were CDC Alma, CDC Cory, and CDC Frontier. All varieties were grown in three different locations in Saskatchewan: Elorse, Limerick, and Lucky Lake. For dry heat related processing, the samples were placed in the oven at 100 degrees C for 60 min. For wet heat related processing (Autoclave), the samples were placed in the autoclave at 120 degrees C for 60 min. For microwave irradiation, the samples were microwaved for 3 min (900 W). The results showed that soluble crude protein (SCP) and non-fiber carbohy-drate (NFC) were highly decreased by autoclave treatment. Moderately degradable protein fraction (PB1) was greater in autoclave treatment. There was no significant difference in indi-gestible protein fractions (PC) among all heat processing methods. Autoclave treatment was lower in rapidly degradable carbohydrate fractions (CA4) but greater in slowly degradable carbohy-drate fraction (CB3). As to energy value parameters, there were different in total digestible nu-trients (TDN) value among processing treatments with greater value in dry heat and microwave treatments. However, there was no difference in net energy for lactation (NEL3X) among pro-cessing treatments. In rumen degradation kinetics, there were no differences in DM rumen degradation kinetics among processing treatments. However, the heat processing affected in situ potential degradable fraction (D) and undegraded fraction (U) of protein. Autoclaving treatment had greater in situ potential degradable fraction but lower undegraded fraction. The processing did not significantly affect rumen bypass protein (BCP) or rumen undegradable protein (RUP) and effective degradation protein (EDCP). For protein intestinal digestion, heat treatments did not affect intestinal digestibility of rumen bypass protein (%dIDP) and intestinal digested crude protein (IDP). For DM intestinal digestion, heat treatments affected digestibility of rumen bypass DM (%dBDM) with greater values in dry heat (90.3%) and microwave (86.5%) and lower value in autoclaving (67.7%). However, total (IDBDM) and intestinal digested dry matter (TDDM) were not significantly affected by processing treatments. For hourly effective degradable ratios (ED_N to ED_DM), microwave showed a greater value. Total true protein supply (DVE value) was not significantly different among processing treatments with average of DVE value of 100 g/kg DM. All three processing methods (dry heating, wet heating, microwave irradiation) had positive degraded protein balance (OEB value) with average of 62 g/kg DM, indicating potential shortage of energy in rumen. Feed Milk Value based DVE value showed no difference among processing treatments. When applied NRC dairy, the results showed that the processing methods also did not significantly affect total Metabolizable Protein supply (MP) to dairy cows with average MP of 82 g/kg DM. But based on NRC model, all treatments had negative degraded protein balance (DPB value) which is different from DVE/OEB system. In conclusion, the response and sensitivity to thermal processing methods of CDC chickpeas showed difference. But important nutrient supply to dairy cows in terms of NEL3x, DVE, MP, OEB, and FMV were not significantly different among processing treatments.																			0377-8401	1873-2216				SEP	2023	303								115698	10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2023.115698	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2023.115698		JUN 2023											WOS:001023879800001

Influence of the Heterogeneity of Bottom Sediments on the Formation of Bacteriobenthos in a Lake of Southern Urals	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												General quantitative (abundance and biomass) and structural (morphological and dimensional) indicators of bacteriobenthos in different morphotypes of bottom sediments of Lake Kandry-Kul (Republic of Bashkortostan) have been determined for the first time. The total abundance of bacteria is 1.8-11.8 x 10(9) cells/mL and biomass is 106-1344 & mu;g/mL. Two types of seasonal dynamics of abundance and biomass of deepwater and coastal bacteriobenthic communities are identified. The influence of heterogeneity of bottom sediments on quantitative indicators and morphological structure of lake bacteriobenthos is considered. The increase in pelitic and aleritic fractions in the mechanical composition of silts contributes to an increase in the total abundance of bacteria and the restructuring of the morphological structure of bacteriobenthos towards an increase in the abundance of coccous forms. The proportion of cocci increases with an increase in the percentage of saprophytes in the total abundance of bacteria.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				JUN	2023	16	3					419	427		10.1134/S1995082923030197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082923030197													WOS:001016944000005

During the study period, 130 species of rotifers and crustaceans were recorded in the lake. The plankton abundance and biomass during the study period were lower or close to the values indicated for 1979-1996. The open littoral of the lake was more often characterized by the low abundance of zooplankton compared to deeper areas (depths exceeding 4 m). Interannual variations in the total abundance and biomass of zooplankton in different seasons of the year were observed, caused by the climatic features of different years and different times of sampling. The composition of the dominant species of rotifers and crustaceans in 2012-2016 was close to that indicated earlier in 1979-1996.

Its hypoxic atmosphere in low oxygen partial pressure, extreme seasonal climate variation, and aridity poses severe challenges as harsh living environments for pre-historic human to occupy in such high-altitude niches. However, the Lake Qinghai is the largest lake on the Tibetan Plateau and the basin has rich water, mineral, and wild food resources, and prehistoric human occupied the Lake Qinghai Basin long before local farming was in practice. In this paper we present results of faunal assemblages associated with variable stone artifacts and pottery shards with bone collagen accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS 14C) dates from 3 new archaeological sites to investigate human occupation history in the southern Lake Qinghai Basin. The AMS 14C dating results reveal that the occupation occurs intermittently from the late Glacial to entire Holocene. Through compilation and synthesis of regional archae-ological records, we found that prehistoric humans went through 3 phases of subsistence strategies: 1) hunting large and medium ungulates; 2) hunting medium ungulates; 3) foraging small size mammals with birds and fish diets. At the end, prehistoric humans increasingly adapted to forage and consume caprinaes species (goat), which represents a precursor of domestication or semi-domestication of wild animals in the Lake Qinghai Basin. We further attribute the utilization of caprinaes animal resources to the lower limbs of toe and phalange bones with low nutritious values to advanced social organization that implied prehistoric humans separated hunting activity from protein processing practices. Our investigation of zooarchaeology with reliable bone collagen AMS 14C dates could become a novel approach to study adaptation strategy and social structure changes of prehistorical Tibetan humans.

Here we report the first documentation of gobioid fishes as hosts of glochidia of unionid mussels in the wild in Italy and in southern Europe (outside of the Danube drainage area). We also examined the pattern of the attached glochidia. A recent review reported 326 fish species as suitable hosts for unionids, but only eight (2.5%) of these were Gobioidei. Host identification and the documentation of their benefits or threats for the interaction of the mussels with their hosts is important for conservation of freshwater mussels. But the co-existence of mussels with non-native fish species is only poorly understood, including the compatibility of these two groups. Knipowitschia panizzae and Pomatoschistus canestrinii, two translocated sand gobies, were sampled in 2022 at the east shore of Lake Trasimeno (Italy). Two species of anodontine mussels were present at this locality, the native Anodonta anatina and the translocated Sinanodonta woodiana. Genetic data revealed that both sand gobies hosted glochidia only of A. anatina but not of S. woodiana, possibly because of seasonal bias. About 50% of the specimens of both fish species were infested. The paired fins were the most prominent targets. The examined individuals of both sand gobies carried only few glochidia (max. 5). Nevertheless, the two species showed a divergent pattern of glochidia attachment.					; Carosi, Antonella/AAE-4635-2020; lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014; Kruckenhauser, Luise/M-3567-2018; Carosi, Antonella/M-4474-2016	Duda, Michael/0000-0002-4694-3165; Kruckenhauser, Luise/0000-0001-8708-4347; lorenzoni, massimo/0000-0002-8548-9487; Carosi, Antonella/0000-0003-0513-7287													1961-9502					APR 5	2023		424							9	10.1051/kmae/2023006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2023006													WOS:000962856000001

The laminated tufa structure allowed for the stratigraphic analysis of mineral, elemental and d(18)O and d(13)C isotope composition. Results are compared to other carbonate archives (lake sediments) from the Plitvice Lakes and to measured water physical-chemical data collected in the same time. An increase in water temperature and decrease in Mg/Ca ratio was observed during that period. Results showed that the tufa Mg/Ca ratio and d(18)O could not be used as a temperature proxy, while an observed d(18)O increase after 1990 was attributed to increase in evaporation rate. Furthermore, the constant increase in redox-sensitive elements (Mn) towards the external part of tufa may indicate periodic events of anoxia at the sediment/water interface. Local enrichment factors (LEFs) for potentially toxic elements were calculated using the background function and Al as the normalizing element. The LEFs showed an enrichment pattern of Cu and Pb in 1983 and 2001, which could indicate their anthropogenic origin and the sensitivity of the tufa to environmental changes.					; Lučić, Mavro/AFK-3809-2022; Felja, Igor/GPK-1947-2022	Tibljas, Darko/0000-0003-1021-585X; Lucic, Mavro/0000-0002-1781-1390; Sironic, Andreja/0000-0001-7256-206X														2073-4441				APR	2023	15	7							1269	10.3390/w15071269	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15071269													WOS:000970523500001

Lakes protect downstream riverine habitats from chloride toxicity	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Freshwater salinization from anthropogenic activities threatens water quality and habitat suitability for many lakes and rivers in North America. Recognizing that salinization is a stress on freshwater environments globally, research on watershed salt transport is necessary for informed management strategies. Prior to this research, there were few studies that examined salt export regimes along a river-lake continuum to investigate the drivers, temporal dynamics, and modulators of freshwater salinization. Here, we use high-frequency in situ monitoring to assess specific conductance-discharge (cQ) relationships, chloride concentrations and fluxes, and the role of lakes in downstream salt transport. The Upper Yahara River Watershed in southern Wisconsin, USA, is a mixed urban and agricultural watershed where the lakes' chloride concentrations have risen from < 5 mg L-1 in the 1940s to > 50-80 mg L-1 in 2021. Our results suggest cQ behavior depends on land use, with urban areas exhibiting more frequent mobilization events during stormflow and agricultural areas exhibiting predominantly dilution dynamics. In addition, chloride loading is driven by hydrology and watershed size whereas concentrations and yields are a function of anthropogenic drivers like urbanization. We demonstrate how an in-network lake attenuates downstream salinity, dampening the hydrologic, anthropogenic, and seasonal patterns observed in rivers upstream of the lake. Importantly, biogeochemical processes in lakes overlay a seasonal signal on salinity that must be considered when investigating temporal dynamics of anthropogenic salinization. This research contributes to understanding of temporal dynamics of salt export through watersheds and can be used to inform management strategies for habitat protection.

Practitioners have been seeking methods to determine the ecological flow of rivers or lakes and how to ensure its implementation. Taking the Dingnan River watershed as a case, drawing on the experience of "Hedging rule', the "Determination-Assessment-Reduction' for the ecological flow nexus approach (the D-A-R approach) is introduced, which includes the determination of the annual ecological flow process through the river section, the assessment of water scarcity degree of the watershed and various water reduction strategies, respectively, and respond to the three scenarios of "general type, saving type and constrained type' during the gap period. The results show that it is possible to use the D-A-R approach to proactively and dynamically adjust the ecological flow according to the prob-ability estimate of that amount of water inflow per month, which the adjusted ecological flow threshold can better adapt to water scarcity at different levels and alleviate the contradiction among domestic, production and ecological water in the water-shed during the dry period.

J	Boratynski, J				Boratynski, Janusz			Could the lake ecosystems influence the pathogenicity of the SARS-COV-2 in the air?	ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA												During the first 200 days of the Covid-19 pandem-ic in Poland, lower morbidity and mortality due to SARS-COV-2 infection were recorded in three regions covered by many small and large lakes (West Pomera-nia 5.8 deaths/100 000 population, Warmian & Masur-ian 7.6 deaths/100 000 population, Lubusz 7.3 deaths /100 000 population, compared to Poland average of 16.0 deaths/100 000 population). Moreover, in Meck-lenburg (Germany), bordering West Pomerania, only 23 deaths (1.4 deaths/100 000 population) were reported during the same period (Germany 10 649 deaths, 12.6 deaths/100 000 population). This unexpected and in-triguing observation would not have been noticed if SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations were available at that time. The hypothesis presented here assumes the biosynthe-sis of biologically active substances by phytoplankton, zooplankton or fungi and transfer of these lectin-like substances to the atmosphere, where they could cause agglutination and/or inactivation of pathogens through supramolecular interactions with viral oligosaccharides. According to the presented reasoning, the low mortal-ity rate due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Southeast Asian countries (Vietnam, Bangladesh, Thailand) could be ex-plained by the influence of monsoons and flooded rice fields on microbiological processes in the environment. Considering the universality of the hypothesis, it is im-portant whether the pathogenic nano-or micro par-ticles are decorated by oligosaccharides (as in case of the African swine fever virus, ASFV). On the other hand, the interaction of influenza hemagglutinins with sialic acid derivatives biosynthesized in the environment dur-ing the warm season may be linked to seasonal fluc-tuations in the number of infections. The presented hypothesis may be an incentive to study unknown ac-tive substances in the environment by interdisciplinary teams of chemists, physicians, biologists, and climatolo-gists.																			0001-527X	1734-154X				2023 MAR 3	2023										10.18388/abp.2020_6514	http://dx.doi.org/10.18388/abp.2020_6514		MAR 2023						36867833					WOS:000944293900001
J	Chikita, KA; Goto, A; Okada, J; Yamaguchi, T; Oyagi, H				Chikita, Kazuhisa A.; Goto, Akio; Okada, Jun; Yamaguchi, Takashi; Oyagi, Hideo			Water Cycles and Geothermal Processes in a Volcanic Crater Lake	HYDROLOGY												Exploring how the hydrological and thermal conditions of a volcanic lake change in response to volcanic activity is important to identify the signs of a volcanic eruption. A water cycle system and a geothermal process in a crater lake, Okama, in the active Zao Volcano, Japan, were explored by estimating the hydrological and chemical budgets of the lake, and analyzing the time series of lake water temperature, respectively. In 2021, the lake level consistently increased by snowmelt plus rainfall in May-June, and then stayed nearly constant in the rainfall season of July-September. The hydrological budget estimated during the increasing lake level indicated that the net groundwater inflow is at any time positive. This suggests that the groundwater inflow to the lake is controlled by the water percolation into volcanic debris from the melting of snow that remained in the catchment. Solving the simultaneous equation from the hydrological and chemical budgets evaluated the groundwater inflow, G(in), at 0.012-0.040 m(3)/s, and the groundwater outflow, G(out), at 0.012-0.027 m(3)/s in May-September 2021. By adding the 2020 values of G(in) and G(out) evaluated at the relatively high lake level, it was found that G(in) and G(out) exhibit highly negative and positive correlations (R-2 = 0.661 and 0.848; p < 0.01) with the lake level, respectively. In the completely ice-covered season of 15 December 2021-28 February 2022, the lake water temperature increased between the bottom and 15 m above the bottom at the deepest point, which reflects the geothermal heat input at the bottom. The heat storage change during the increasing water temperature was evaluated at a range of -0.4-5.5 W/m(2) as the 10-day moving average heat flux. By accumulating the daily heat storage change for the calculated period, the water temperature averaged over the heated layer increased from 1.08 to 1.56 degrees C. The small temperature increase reflects a stagnant state of volcanic activity in the Zao Volcano. The present study could be useful to investigate how an active volcano responds to water percolation and geothermal heat.

J	Lawniczak-Malinska, A				Lawniczak-Malinska, Agnieszka			Effect of Water Level Reduction on the Littoral Zone in Terms of Its Efficiency in Lake Protection	SUSTAINABILITY												Decreased water levels due to climate change cause many negative effects on lake ecosystems. The aim of this study was to (a) assess the effect of the reduction of water levels on nutrient availability in the sediment in the littoral zone; (b) evaluate the effect of changes in water level on biomass productivity and nutrient concentrations in the aboveground biomass of four emergent species: Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., Typha angustifolia L., Carex acutiformis L., Glyceria maxima (C. Hartm.) Holmb; and (c) assess the efficiency of the littoral zone in the reduction of nutrient pollution. The study hypothesis was that water level reduction has a positive effect on the plant biomass of high productive species. The study was carried out in the littoral zone of Tomickie Lake, situated in the western part of Poland. This lake is located in the protected area-the buffer zone of Wielkopolska National Park, and at the international level-Natura 2000. Six transects, perpendicular to the shoreline, were selected at two subzones-permanently and seasonally flooded. Analyses of nutrient concentrations in sediments and plant species were performed. The results show the higher productivity of reeds in the zone where water occurs seasonally at the site through the year, which reached 1193 g dry weight/m(2). The decline of the water level may lead to the increased growth of highly productive species as emergent vegetation with a broad ecological scale in terms of nutrient concentrations and changes of water depth, i.e., Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. Species that prefer growth in the deeper part of the lake will be characterized by lower productivity, despite the high availability of nutrients. Changes in the availability of nutrients may cause the intensification of lake overgrowth by very productive species, which may affect biodiversity, which is particularly high in protected areas.

But there have been few studies on the complete change process of primary productivity during the ice-covered period, and the connection between ice physical and associated biological production has not been fully understood. In this study, a Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) suitable for the ice-covered period was used to calculate the primary productivity of a temperate lake, and the key physical controlling factor was analyzed in the process of primary productivity change in the ice-covered period. The results showed that there was a high level of primary productivity, (189.1 +/- 112.6) mg C center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1), under the ice in the study site, Hanzhang Lake. The phytoplankton production under the ice was not as severely restricted by light as commonly thought. The water temperature played a more crucial role in the changes of primary productivity than the light beneath the ice. The study highlighted the variability in primary productivity covering the whole ice-covered age, and provided a better understanding of how the aquatic environment of lakes in seasonal ice-covered areas was affected by warmer temperatures.					; ZHANG, YIWEN/JYP-9193-2024	Song, Haoming/0000-0003-2065-2981; 														2073-4441				MAR	2023	15	5							918	10.3390/w15050918	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15050918													WOS:000947616900001

Water quality parameters and constituent concentrations measured in the Peel and Arctic Red Rivers, 2007-2010	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Outflow from north-flowing circumpolar rivers has a strong influence on the Arctic Ocean. The Peel and Arctic Red Rivers are tributaries of the Mackenzie Delta, a large, lake-rich floodplain that forms the interface between the Mackenzie River and the Beaufort Sea basin of the Arctic Ocean. Here, we present water quality data that were collected from the Peel and Arctic Red Rivers between 2007 and 2010 as part of an International Polar Year project that investigated the seasonal hydrology and biogeochemistry of the Mackenzie River and its delta. The Peel River was sampled 57 times between May 2007 and September 2010 upstream of the community of Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories (NT), while the Arctic Red River was sampled 32 times between May 2007 and August 2008 (with one additional sample in June 2010) approximately 0.5 km upstream of its confluence with the Mackenzie River near the community of Tsiigehtchic, NT. Each water sample was analyzed for up to 22 water quality parameters, including water temperature, specific conductivity, pH, chlorophyll a, total suspended sediments, particulate nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus), soluble reactive silica, major ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chloride, and sulfate), dissolved carbon (inorganic and organic fractions), and dissolved nutrients (three nitrogen and two phosphorus fractions). This data set, which is available for download and reuse, provides important baseline information about water quality in the Peel and Arctic Red Rivers, complements other data that have been collected in these watersheds, and will be of interest to researchers, resource managers, Indigenous organizations, and governments that are active in the region.

This research aims to assess the water quality of the surface waterbodies in the north-eastern region of Kashmir Valley. Standard analytical procedures were used to analyze the water samples taken from 11 distinct sampling stations for 14 physiochemical parameters. The results were compared with the standard permissible levels which showed that the water quality of rivers and lakes in the north-east Himalayan region has steadily declined. Furthermore, multivariate statistical techniques were used with the goal to identify key variables that influence seasonal and sectional water quality variations. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis revealed that there is substantial spatio-temporal variability in the water quality parameters. According to principal component analysis (PCA) results, four primary components, which together accounted for 79.23% of the total variance, could be used to evaluate all data. Chemical, organic, and conventional pollutants were found to be significant latent factors influencing the water quality of rivers in the study region. The results indicate that PCA and ANOVA may be used as vital tools to identify crucial surface water quality indices and the most contaminated river sections.					gull, sarvat/ACV-0923-2022; Shah, Shagoofta/ABB-3478-2020; DAR, AYAZ MOHMOOD/R-2688-2016														2709-8028	2709-8036				FEB	2023	72	2					202	220		10.2166/aqua.2023.230	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2023.230		FEB 2023											WOS:000933598300001
J	Chen, G; Guo, ZY; Yoshimura, C				Chen, Guo; Guo, Zhongyu; Yoshimura, Chihiro			Integration of Photodegradation Process of Organic Micropollutants to a Vertically One-Dimensional Lake Model	SUSTAINABILITY												Photochemical reactions in the water environments are essential for understanding the fate of organic pollutants, which exist widely in aquatic environments causing potential risks. Therefore, this study aimed to integrate a module of the photodegradation process into a vertically one-dimensional model of the lake to quantify the influence of phytoplankton on the photodegradation process for the first time. After adjusting the code of the APEX (Aqueous Photochemistry of Environmentally occurring Xenobiotics), the suite of photochemical reactions was integrated into the pollutant module of MyLake (Multi-year Lake simulation), as MyLake-Photo. This integrated model was then applied to calculate the concentration of four organic micropollutants under the ranges of solar radiation conditions (0-390 W/m(2)), phytoplankton biomass (0.01-20 mg/m(3) of chlorophyll), and water temperature (1-25 degrees C). These scenario analyses revealed that phytoplankton biomass and pollutant photodegradation are negatively correlated owing to the light absorption by chlorophyll. Thermal stratification also significantly influenced the vertical distribution of organic micropollutants. Then, the model was applied for calculating a temporal distribution of ibuprofen concentration in Lake Giles (PA, USA) with a simple but realistic assumption. The concentration of organic micropollutants varies with seasons, which was mainly affected by the changes in irradiance and water temperature. In this manner, the integrated model is capable of estimating the temporal and vertical shifts of the concentration of organic micropollutants in lakes, allowing us to investigate the fate of organic micropollutants in lakes. The integrated model also allows us to investigate the effect of phytoplankton and CDOM on the photodegradation of organic micropollutants, which should be combined with field surveys and experimental studies for further improvement.

Bladderwort Relationship to Zooplankton in Two Northern Michigan Lakes	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Traditionally, most of our understanding of lake zooplankton dynamics is from data collected in the pelagic, open water zone. However, the littoral and benthic zones of lakes can play a role in zooplankton community interactions and relationships. Utricularia spp., or the bladderworts, inhabit littoral and shallow waters of lakes and consume zooplankton. Limited information exists on the dietary habits of bladderworts and how diet varies across lakes and seasonally. Bladderwort dietary assemblage in two Michigan, USA, lakes was quantified during the thermally stratified period of 2020, and was compared to zooplankton in the adjacent water column. Bladderwort trap size was positively related to zooplankton prey size, but not number of prey consumed or taxa richness. Bladderworts consumed a variety of prey, the majority dominated by littoral cladoceran and ostracod taxa. Seasonal change was observed, with significantly higher ostracod dominance earlier in the season, shifting into cladoceran dominance later in the season. Ostracods were more commonly found in traps than the water column, whereas Cladocera were more commonly found in the water column than the traps. These results shed light into the dietary habits of bladderworts, which can have consequences for food web dynamics and energy transfer in small lake systems.

J	Koue, J				Koue, Jinichi			STUDY ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONTROLLING FACTORS OF HYPOXIA IN THE BOTTOM OF LAKE BIWA, JAPAN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE												Lake Biwa in Japan is a water resource utilized by approximately 14 million people in Kansai region, and its water pollution has a significant impact not only on people but also on the ecosystem, particularly in the bottom layer, where hypoxia can cause an environmental problem. Until the 1980s, eutrophication was the main cause of hypoxia of the lake bottom, and after the measures for eutrophication, it is not clear what the main cause quantitatively is such as climate change and a regime shift in the ecosystem. In the present study, seasonal and secular variations of water quality in Lake Biwa over the past 30 years were analyzed by using vertical profile data of water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration observed at Imazu-oki, the deepest point of observation and weather data at Hikone. The results of the analysis showed that intensity of stratification increased in the surface layer of Lake Biwa, but conversely stratification weakened in the deeper layers. These changes in the physical environment of the lake have affected the decline of dissolved oxygen in the lake bottom of Lake Biwa. The seasonal changes in dissolved oxygen over 30 years could be classified into approximately three patterns, with the dominant factors being the strengthening of stratification due to the change in air temperature and wind speed, the shortening of the period of the overturning and the vertical mixing by wind during the stratified season and cooling period.

The objectives were to determine the correlation between temporally and spatially distributed AL items with gastropods and bioassessment of lake from AL. Generally, the AL consisted of plastic products, rubber, cans, paper, and glass, where plastic bags were discovered more during the two seasons at insignificantly different quantities (p>0.05) and all stations at significantly different amounts (p<0.05). The total number and percentage AL cover with gastropods had a low linear regression value and increased by more than 80% during the rainy season. Meanwhile, the difference in the number of AL was insignificant by season but significant based on the station. Although AL had little effect on gastropods, the number of individual organisms decreased as the number and percentage of cover increased and vice versa. The results suggest that variation of presence of gastropods can be used as a bioassessment inorganic pollution of lake ecosystems.

In this letter, we compared the newest FT products, SMAP36 (36 km resolution) and SMAP09 (9 km resolution) provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and one product, AMSR2 FT, generated by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) against surface soil temperature measurements across Russia using a total of 494 stations. The results indicate that AMSR2 FT has a better performance in Russia than the SMAP products, which is more pronounced in the AM (descending orbit) value of overall accuracy (OA) than in the PM (ascending orbit). It is challenging to distinguish FT states in the transition periods between warm and cold seasons, but AMSR2 FT performs better than SMAP products. AMSR2 FT has a high OA in inland areas but a low OA along coastal zones because pixels may contain a water body or lake ice. The poorest SMAP results are mainly distributed in mixed forest areas, indicating that the algorithm should be improved to solve the wet snow problem in these areas. The results of this study could help improve FT products in Russia and provide application instructions for FT product users.

Our objective is to study the zooplankton (Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda) community structure during and after the impoundment of a newly constructed reservoir, to provide valuable knowledge on species diversity, community structure and dynamics to be considered in future management plans. The impoundment period was characterized by increased species richness with high turnover because of the zooplankton's high dispersal ability and reflected the inoculation of the reservoir with local fauna. Zooplankton during this period were also correlated negatively with depth and positively with total organic nitrogen and nitrate, highlighting the importance of trophic impact. The time following the impoundment reflected the colonization processes to more stable communities. The seasonality domination followed the Mediterranean pattern, with cold and warm periods being differentiated by changes in community structure, while abundance and biomass remained low throughout the studied period. Combined with the dominance of small-sized individuals, it resulted in low grazing pressure, indicating that zooplankton was not the factor controlling phytoplankton.					; Michaloudi, Evangelia/AAS-4574-2021	Kozari, Argyri/0000-0002-4543-1360; Michaloudi, Evangelia/0000-0001-8194-2865; Demertzioglou, Maria/0000-0001-8691-6877; Pantelaki, Ioanna/0000-0001-9908-5566														1424-2818				FEB	2023	15	2							257	10.3390/d15020257	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15020257													WOS:000939057400001

Characterization of Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) habitat and resources availability in the Alvarado Lagoon System, Veracruz	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Historically, the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) was distributed along the coastline comprised by the five Mexican states that border the Gulf of Mexico. However, the few healthy populations that currently exist in Mexico are now limited to relatively isolated regions with very specific habitat characteristics. In the state of Veracruz, a limited number of individuals are found in the Alvarado Lagoon System (ALS), located in the coastal zone of southern central Veracruz. The aim of this study was to characterize manatee habitat in the ALS. Transects were established in the ALS and 503 points selected and sampled along these transects, producing data pertaining to salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, surface water temperature, pH, bottom type, and conductivity. A total of 45 outings were conducted, with a total sampling effort of 332.36 h. The average physicochemical parameters found were as follows: salinity 3.33 ppm, total dissolved solids 0.51 g/l, temperature 26.29 & DEG;C, dissolved oxygen 0.51%, pH 7.55, and oxidation-reduction potential 417.04 mV. Thirteen manatees were observed, mostly (84.6%) during the cold, where the parameters of electrical conductivity, salinity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and oxidation-reduction potential showed differences between the sampled seasons, and in the lagoons with a presence of the floating and submersible vegetation species that form part of manatees' diet. This study shows that the ALS presents lagoons that favor the presence of the Antillean manatee, further narrowing the distribution of the species within the same ALS in the southern central zone of the state of Veracruz.

However, the role of environmental change in a lasting high-phosphorus lake driving the genetic differentiation of zooplankton population structure over time is poorly understood. In this paper, the changes of the genetic diversity and differentiation of Daphnia sinensis population were studied by using the mitochondrial COI gene and microsatellite markers on modern groups (from January to June 2016) and historic groups (obtained from resting eggs in the sediments) in Lake Chaohu. Based on the microsatellite markers, six modern groups were clustered into two clusters (the WG cluster and SG cluster) during the seasonal dynamics, whereas the genetic differentiation of the five historic groups showed a wave-like pattern and had evolved into four clusters. Moreover, the haplotype network showed that six modern groups had one origin center whereas five historic groups had two origin centers based on the mitochondrial COI gene marker. Fu's Fs neutral test and Tajima's test indicated that the five historic groups deviated from neutral evolution and showed a bottleneck effect in the history process. Water temperature and total dissolved phosphorus were obviously associated with the seasonal genetic differentiation of D. sinensis, whereas nitrogen content of the sediments was significantly related to the long-term microevolution of D. sinensis in the high-phosphorus environment. Therefore, the changing pattern of D. sinensis population genetic structure was one of the environmental selections probably combined with co-evolutionary, where rapid-increasing nitrogen level had a large impact on D. sinensis population genetic structure in lasting high phosphorus environment in Lake Chaohu.					liuqi, sea/GZN-1392-2022														2296-701X					JAN 11	2023	10								913738	10.3389/fevo.2022.913738	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.913738													WOS:000917797600001

Evaluating community science sampling for microplastics in shore sediments of large river watersheds	FACETS												A community science project in the Ottawa River Watershed in Canada interacted with an existing volunteer base to collect sediment from 68 locations in the watershed over approximately 750 km. Ninety-one percent of the distributed kits were returned with 42 volunteers taking part in the project. After analysis, particle concentrations were relatively low compared to previous freshwater microplastic sediment research, with contributing factors including (but not limited to) the large size of the watershed, a lower population base compared to other researched freshwater watersheds, the relative size and discharge of the Ottawa River and the large seasonal fluxes experienced in the river basin. Utilising community science for sampling large freshwater watersheds demonstrated its advantages in the research, especially spatially. However, careful consideration to research design and implementation is essential for community science projects examining microplastics in freshwater sediments. Research teams should ensure they are responsible for strict quality assurance and quality control protocols, especially in the laboratory with sample preparation and processing. Nonetheless, community science is potentially an extremely useful approach for researchers to use for microplastic sampling projects over large spatial areas.

This research aims to assess water quality based on the condition of chemical-physical variables and phytoplankton composition. This research was conducted from late May to early October 2021 (the dry season until the inter-seasonal period). The Water Quality Index (WQI) ranged from 61.18-79.53 (medium-good). Phytoplankton composition consisted of 65 genera from 11 classes and 6 divisions. Oscillatoria, Euglena and Pediastrum were the dominant genera, meanwhile, Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae were the dominant class. Phytoplankton communities in all lakes were stable except RL and based on Jaccard index the value of inter-lakes show no identical similarities (not equal 1). In (Nygaard) values ranged from 2.50-undefined (slight-high eutrophication), and X (Saprobic indices) values ranged from 0.33-1.80 (very slight pollution -moderate pollution). The best correlations (both values were r = 0.53) in water quality between the variables were DO (ppm) and BOD (ppm) Urban lakes require further improvement in their lake management to be used as sources of drinking water.					; Ramadhan, Firdaus/NPI-5857-2025	Haribowo, Dinda Rama/0000-0002-2896-0850; 														2602-473X					2023	38	4					194	204		10.26650/ASE20231267923	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/ASE20231267923													WOS:001084867600002

The model presented was created as part of the 12th SIGSPATIAL Cup Competition and incorporates Sentinel-2 imagery, training lake polygons at four distinct temporal periods during the 2019 melt season and ArcticDEM data to determine the most optimal approach to extract supraglacial lake footprints. Results show that the DUCK-Net works best on solely sentinel 2 and achieved an accuracy score of 93% on a pixel to pixel agreement but an accuracy of 67% on the test data provided by the GISCUP hosts. Overall, this approach enables a flexible approach to easily extract supraglacial lakes across temporal periods and could be easily reapplied to other glacial regions across the world.

IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON STREAMFLOW USING A REGIONAL CLIMATE MODEL (CASE STUDY IN RIBB WATERSHED, LAKE TANA SUB-BASIN, ETHIOPIA)	19TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASIA OCEANIA GEOSCIENCES SOCIETY, AOGS 2022					19th Annual Meeting of the Asia-Oceania-Geosciences-Society (AOGS)	AUG 01-05, 2022	ELECTR NETWORK	Asia Oceania Geosciences Soc				This study investigates the impacts of climate change on streamflow of the Ribb River watershed using the SWAT model and a Regional Climate Model (RCM). Regional climate scenario projected by the CORDEX RCM (RCA4) with the horizontal grid spacings of similar to 50km was used to estimate historical (1979-2015) and future (2020-2100) climate under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The projected climate variables were bias-corrected using a linear-scaling approach. Trends of the projected climate variables were checked by the M-K trend analysis. The variables showed an increasing trend for monthly maximum and minimum temperatures compared to the reference period for both RCP scenarios. However, there was no systematic increasing and decreasing trend of precipitation over the century. Annual precipitation, long rainy and dry seasons showed an increasing trend, while short rainy seasons showed a decreasing trend under both RCPs. The SWAT model was applied to evaluate the impacts of future climate change on hydrology and water resources. The performance of the model was evaluated through calibration and validation process using observed streamflow data over the period (1979-2012). The SWAT model performed well with reasonable accuracy (R2>0.7). The projected streamflow showed an increasing trend except for the 2080s in the RCP8.5 scenario, and its magnitude varied up to 58-66% in dry and 21-55% in rainy season for each RCP scenario compared to the reference period. Increases in seasonal and annual streamflow were mainly associated with increases in the projected precipitation.																					978-981-127-544-9; 978-981-127-543-2				2023							19	21		10.1142/9789811275449_0007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789811275449_0007													WOS:001241648000007

Therefore, the contamination by toxic metals in sediments of the Coata River was evaluated up to its mouth at Lake Titicaca (Peru). Five sampling points were considered during two seasons using simple sampling techniques, analyzing the concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), and Lead (Pb). To assess the level of contamination, it was compared with the Threshold Effect Level (TEL) and Slightly Elevated Stream Sediments (SESS) reference standards. Concentrations in sediments (mg/kg) for As (0,80 to 14,90), Cd (0,10 to 0,70), and Hg (0,004 to 0,30) were reported, which exceed the TEL and SESS reference standards. Additionally, Cr (4,10 to 28,41) exceeds the SESS reference standard. The sediment in the Coata River carries a load of toxic metals. This contamination in the sediment has a lithogenic and anthropogenic origin and is particularly associated with the discharge from the Torococha River, which daily contributes to the pollution of these waters.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the negative impact of metal pollution on the fish reproductive system. It was performed using the gonadal histopathology, hepatosomatic index (HSI), and gonadosomatic index (GSI) of three fish species, Capoeta damascina, Squalius semae and Alburnus sellal inhabiting in Karasu River (Erzurum, Turkey) contaminated by various anthropogenic activities. The highest GSI values were determined for each sex according to the seasons, and lower GSI values were observed in polluted stations in all three species. It was observed that HSI values in fish varied significantly from station to station. In addition, an increase in ovarian and testicular lesions (degeneration in oocyte and spermatocytes, atresia, congestion, infiltration, edema, vascular hypertrophy, fibrosis) was detected in the polluted areas. The results clearly showed that the metal pollution in the river adversely affected the reproductive system of the fish species living in the river.

J	Efremova, TA				Efremova, T. A.			Carbohydrates in surface waters and its relation to the nutrients and organic matter content	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The results of a long-term research of the content of carbohydrates in natural waters of Republic of Karelia (Russia) from 2011 to 2020 are summarized. In total, 34 water bodies (29 lakes and 5 rivers) were studied in different hydrological seasons. The presented sample of water bodies captures almost all types of surface waters in the humid zone in terms of trophicity and humus content. It was found that the carbohydrates concentration varies widely from 0.7 to 53.1 mg/L (average 3.3 mg/L) and its share of total organic matter averages 16%. It was revealed that the content and distribution of carbohydrates in surface waters depends both on natural (the level of trophicity and humus content in the reservoir) and anthropogenic factors (eutrophication, trout farms, industrial wastewater discharge, seepage waters of solid waste landfills, communal wastewater). In addition, all the studied water bodies were categorized into two groups according to the water pollution degree: contaminated and uncontaminated. It was revealed that the concentration of carbohydrates in contaminated water bodies of Karelia is on average 1.4 times higher than in uncontaminated ones. In addition, the content of carbohydrates increases together with such chemical parameters as 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), permanganate oxygen demand (CODMn), chlorophyll a, mineral and total phosphorus (P-min and P(total )relatively) and ammonium (N-NH4+). In particular, these relations are pronounced in contaminated water bodies, where the highest values of the correlation coefficient between the above parameters are noted. The content of carbohydrates in surface waters is a complex indicator of both organic and biogenic water pollution.

An interactive Excel spreadsheet was constructed to implement the model equations to yield the rate constants and the rates of the Hg(II) photoreduction. The model calculations used field-measured data of DGM paired with its emission flux coupled with the corresponding field sampling times. This data set came from a previous, separate, year-long field study conducted at a southern reservoir lake (Cane Creek Lake, Cookeville, Putnam County, TN). The mean value of the model-calculated rate constants (k(DGM)) of the Hg(II) photoreduction for the warm season (June-August) (4.5 fM h(-1)/pg L-1) is higher than that for the cold season (October-January) (2.2 fM h(-1)/pg L-1). The rate constants were found to be the highest (22.5 fM h(-1)/pg L-1) in August whereas the lowest (0.03 fM h(-1)/pg L-1) in January. The model-calculated rate constants are clearly higher in value than but comparable in order of magnitude to the published kinetic data. The model-calculated rates (r(DGM)) of the Hg(II) photoreduction are significantly higher, by one order of magnitude (10(2) vs. 10(1)) than the apparent rates calculated using the same field DGM data without consideration of the Hg emission from the water. A sensitivity analysis of the model parameters points to a high sensitivity of Hg emission flux to the rate constant under modeled realistic environmental conditions. The initial Hg(II) concentration is also a sensitive model parameter under certain conditions. The results of our model study support the conclusion that DGM emission from water has a strong impact on the kinetics of aquatic Hg(II) photoreduction and the model calculation can provide an independent, valuable approach for estimating the kinetics of aquatic Hg(II) photoreduction.

The present study examines the spatial and seasonal variation in fish communities and assesses the influence of environmental parameters on the community structure of Lake Koca. A total of 1.530 specimens were captured, representing seven families and 11 species (2 non-native, 1 introduced, and 8 native species). Total fish abundance and richness were higher at the littoral than at the limnetic zone, but no seasonal variation was observed. Non-native fish species, Coptodon zillii, was the most abundant in the littoral zone, followed by species of Mugilidae. The abundance of the two endemic fish species (Capoeta aydinensis and Ladigesocypris irideus) was relatively low in both habitats. Shannon-Wiener diversity index and evenness did not vary seasonally and spatially. Fish abundance and richness were significantly and positively correlated with chlorophyll-a and macrophyte coverage while negatively correlated with depth. Spearmen's Correlation analysis revealed that native fish species show a relationship with the chemical parameters of the water, while C. zillii showed a distribution related to depth and macrophyte density. Both anthropogenic activities and the presence of non-native fish may affect the distribution and abundance of endemic fishes.

The parameters measured, including temperature, transparency, pH, DO, TN, and TP concentrations, were collected from seven lake locations, i.e., in the middle of the lake, near do-mestic, hydropower, endemic fisheries, and aquaculture cage areas, and inlet-outlet rivers. Phytoplankton samples were collected from the middle of the lake, near domestic and aquaculture cage areas. TSI analysis shows that Maninjau Lake was hypereutrophic, with an average TSI of 101.15. The phytoplankton community comprises six classes and 22 species dominated by Microcystis aeroginosa and Synedra acus. Bacillariophyceae had the highest phytoplankton concentration, while Cyanophyceae had the highest density. The diversity and equity index of the phytoplankton community structure were low and less evenly distributed, confirming that the lake was hypereutro-phic. The highest diversity index was found in the middle of the lake or the most profound part, while the lowest was near the domestic area. Among the physicochemical parameters, transparency has a strong correlation with dominant phytoplankton.																			2299-8993						2023	24	9					218	231		10.12911/22998993/169233	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/169233													WOS:001042571000004

However, anthropogenic impacts continue to pose threats to lake health. This study investigates the health of selected Adirondack lakes by analyzing extensive field data collected in the late 1970s and 1980s, primarily focusing on lake acidification caused by coal plant emissions. Ongoing concerns regarding algal blooms, rising temperatures, and other threats necessitate a comprehensive understanding of climatological changes in the region. Remote sensing observations from multiple satellites, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat series, are utilized to monitor lake health over long periods of time. This study explores the capabilities and usage of these satellites to assess land and lake surface parameters. By extracting satellite data, seasonal statistics are analyzed to uncover trends in lake temperature and seasonality. The findings highlight the importance of remote sensing in retrospectively measuring all seasons, identifying significant warming rates, and emphasizing the need for in situ measurements to validate satellite products and preserve the health of lakes within the Adirondack region.

This study analyzed 4315 total nitrogen (TN) and Chla samples in 155 reservoirs in Ceara, Brazil. Relationships were obtained between TN and Chla through simple linear regression and classified according to the statistical performance of the coefficient of determination (R-2). The dynamics of these correlations were examined by analyzing the variance between classification groups concerning watershed, reservoir size, coefficient of variability, and trophic state. The concentration of pollutants was influenced by seasonality, which increased significantly from the wet to the dry period in most basins. The coefficients of determination between Chla and TN for the watersheds followed the trends of classic curves in the literature, with satisfactory models (R-2 > 0.3) in most reservoirs (53.3%). The variance analysis attested that the models' performance was affected by the basins, the volumetric variation, and the change in the trophic state levels. There was no significant variance of R-2 between reservoirs of different sizes.

Currently, the lake is being threatened by severe pollution stress, especially with heavy metals. Heavy metal pollution is a great concern of matter as it enters in the bioaccumulation and bio-magnification processes of the aquatic food chain. The present study seasonally investigated the bioaccumulation of seven heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Fe, Cu, Cr, Cd and Co) in the body tissues of an edible bivalve, Marcia recens, from three sampling stations (viz. Neendakara, Kureepuzha and Asramam) of the lake during the study period in 2019. The results showed that, as per the standard permissible limits (FAO/USEPA, 1989), some of the metal accumulations were extremely high in the bivalve tissues. Highest Metal Pollution Index was observed in station II. There were significant spatial and temporal variations in the accumulation of heavy metals in the the examined bivalve. Two way ANOVA analysis also reveals a statistically significant differences (p<0.5), in the heavy metal accumulation in the bivalve, among the stations as well as seasons. The continual exposure to even a relatively low levels of these metals by regular consumption of contaminated bivalves, may entail adverse health issues. Implementation of appropriate scientific and sustainable conservation strategies will ensure the health of the estuaries and the sustainability of bio-resources.																			2383-451X	2383-4501					2023	9	4					1439	1449		10.22059/POLL.2023.356214.1829	http://dx.doi.org/10.22059/POLL.2023.356214.1829													WOS:001104624400044

Assessment of plankton diversity and physico-chemical characteristics for sustainable fish production in a tropical reservoir in South India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Plankton forms an important component of the aquatic ecosystem and act as indicators of fish diversity, pollution levels and environmental disturbances. They form an important natural fish food resource and play a vital role in the trophic structure of the ecosystem. In the present study a systematic assessment of the community distribution and diversity of plankton was conducted in the Karapuzha Reservoir in South India. Thirty six genera of phytoplankton belonging to 4 classes viz, Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae and Myxophyceae were identified. Eleven genera of zooplankton belonging to four classes; Protozoa, Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda were also recorded. The Jaccard index of similarity showed that pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons shared a similar plankton composition. Diversity indices revealed the highest values during monsoon, while the Dominance index indicated the highest species dominance during post-monsoon (0.199) followed by pre-monsoon (0.1445) and monsoon (0.1417). Water quality parameters were found to have a significant correlation with plankton abundance in the reservoir. Shannon Weiner index indicated that the Karapuzha Reservoir ecosystem is moderately polluted. Seasonal variations in plankton composition showed the highest species abundance during the pre-monsoon followed by post-monsoon and monsoon seasons.

AUTOMATIC EXTRACTION OF SURFACE DYNAMICS USING GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE FOR UNDERSTANDING DROUGHT PHENOMENON	39TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT ISRSE-39 FROM HUMAN NEEDS TO SDGS, VOL. 48-M-1	International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				39th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment (ISRSE) - From Human needs to SDGs	APR 24-28, 2023	Antalya, TURKEY					Atmospheric drought due to meteorological events occurring out of seasonal norms, and consequent droughts in agriculture and wetlands cause great damage to the ecological balance. The initial effects of this situation appear on a local scale, while the aftereffects, which last for years, appear on a global scale. Monitoring and detecting drought with remote sensing technologies can contribute to the management of water resources and forest areas and enable many measures to be taken to reduce the effects of drought. Within the scope of this study, a system that automatically performs the extraction of different drought parameters depending on years has been developed. Isikli Lake was selected as the study area and the change of water areas over the years has been extracted from satellite images. With the system developed on the Google Earth Engine platform, different parameters were analyzed over a 13-year period and their consistency was tested. As a result, it is seen that the water areas in the lake decreased by 30% between 2010 and 2022. Likewise, the systematic decrease in the parameters, especially in 2015 and afterward, indicates the drought in the region. With the proposed automatic system, it is thought that early precautions can be taken for drought scenarios that may occur in larger-scale regions.

Distinct environmental conditions between rivers and lakes respectively support their own unique fish populations. However, there are few studies on the transition of fish communities and habitat characteristics between rivers and lakes. The present study was undertaken in the Poyang Lake outflow channel, which connects the Yangtze River with Poyang Lake. A field survey was conducted by means of fish hydroacoustic detection, acoustic velocity profiling and water environment parameter measurement during the flood season of Poyang Lake. The results shows that there were two different distribution patterns of fish communities in the outflow channel. In the reach close to the Yangtze River with high flow velocity, large water depth and relatively narrow range of habitat conditions, the fish density were relatively low and fish mainly distributed in the main channel and along the riparian zone. Higher fish density occurred in the reach close to the main lake district of Poyang Lake, where contained a wide range of habitat conditions, and was characterized by high water temperature, high dissolved oxygen and high chlorophyll content, and the distribution of fish was relatively uniform. Understanding the spatial distributions and transition processes of fish communities between rivers and lakes is essential for the management and conservation of the ecological processes of the river network ecosystem.

Both the water consumption of the Neo-Panamax locks and the salt intrusion into the freshwater reservoir Gatun Lake are of keen interest for the Panama Canal. In assignment of the Panama Canal, Deltares included the Neo-Panamax locks into the Lake Gatun Water Quality Model (LGWQM) to allow for the analysis of the effect of a range of measures to minimize both the water consumption of the locks (especially during the dry season) and the salt intrusion. Based on the comparison of calculation results of LGWQM with the available measurement data on water level and salinity in Lake Gatun, it is concluded the model describes the processes ruling the water consumption and salt distribution correctly. Measures like the reduction of the gate-open-times and the use of the Water Saving Basins are evaluated with LGWQM, as well as the use of bubble screens at the lock heads and several other measures. Some of the measures (the use of the Water Saving Basins and flushing) show an effect on the water consumption and the salt intrusion, whereas other measures (like reduction of the gate-open-times and bubble screens) only influence the salt intrusion. The Panama Canal will use the LGWQM calculation results in the preparation of the Water Management Project to select a combination of measures to maintain both the water level and water quality of Lake Gatun.																					978-90-833476-1-5				2023							396	403		10.3850/978-90-833476-1-5_iahr40wc-p1634-cd	http://dx.doi.org/10.3850/978-90-833476-1-5_iahr40wc-p1634-cd													WOS:001517265000055
J	Shankar, HNK; Ponnusamy, P				Shankar, Hemath Naveen Krishnam; Ponnusamy, Porchelvan			Seasonal Distribution of Escherichia coli and Relationship Among Physicochemical Parameters in Lake Water in the Gudiyattam Area, Tamil Nadu, India	AQUATIC SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING												The freshwater ecosystem is deteriorating and becoming more polluted due to industrialization, urbanization, and increasing industries. This study is about the bacteriological and physicochemi-cal properties of the lake water in Gudiyattam town and its surroundings. For this research, samples of lake water from different locations were collected monthly during the period from May 2019 to April 2020 and analyzed based on standard procedures. The physicochemical parameters and bac-teriological analyses were studied for all four lakes (S1, S2, S3 and S4). The bacterial analysis results showed the presence of coliform bacteria in all lakes. The most dominant value of the MPN index for total coliform number was determined as 80,000 MPN/100mL, at S4 (Valathur) location during monsoon season. It is understood from the fecal coliform count that location S4 was again found to be dominant when compared to the other lakes, with a result of 8,500MPN/100mL in the mon-soon season. The possible reason for the high bacteriological values is thought to be the mixing of drainage waters into the lakes. The MPN value was higher in the monsoon season compared to the pre-monsoon season, which indicates that agricultural runoff occurs in the monsoon season. All the lakes were contaminated with bacterial populations, especially at location S4, which needs the most attention among all the lakes. The above-selected lakes are major surveilling factors for hu-mans for various activities.																				2602-473X					2023	38	2					89	96		10.26650/ASE20221221201	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/ASE20221221201													WOS:000988279900003
J	Sullivan, RM				Sullivan, Robert M.			Time series modeling of rainfall and lake elevation in relation to breaching events at the Lake Earl and Tolowa lagoon system, coastal northern California	CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE JOURNAL												I evaluated trends in spatial and temporal variability in historical levels of rainfall, water elevation, and breach events for lakes Earl, Tolowa, and their combined lagoon system along the coast of northern California. I examined the efficacy of time series analyses to model and forecast rainfall and lake elevation at a regional scale from 2008 to 2021. I employed semi-parametric Generalized Additive Model regression to investigate the historical relationship between anthropogenic breaching of the lagoon and simultaneous occurrences of environmental parameters to better understand conditions surrounding each breach event. Evaluation of the central tendency of rainfall and surface lake elevation showed high fluctuations in their mean, positive skewed, and leptokurtic curves. Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests found that seasonal rainfall was stationary, but surface lake elevation attained stationarity only after the first seasonal difference. Decomposition of each time series and Mann Kendall and Sen's slope estimators, found a significant decreasing trend in seasonal surface lake elevation but no trend was found in rainfall. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series analysis and diagnostic tests of stability and reliability found best fit models for rainfall (SARIMA[1,0,0] [2,1,1]12) and surface lake elevation (SARIMA [1,1,2] [1,0,0]12) used to forecast future values for each parameter. Multiple regression of variables obtained at each breach event showed that the proportion of variance (55.0%) and null deviance (72.1%) explained by the combination of rainfall, hightide, and wave height was the "best" model with the lowest Generalized Cross-Validation statistic of all other models evaluated. All models agreed that rainfall was the most significant factor within each set of predictor attributes used to model surface lake elevation. A declining trend in surface elevation in combination with variation in the historical area and extent of wetland plant communities may be attributable to systematic breaching of the lagoon annually.																			2689-419X	2689-4203					2023	108	4							e22	10.51492/cfwj.108.20	http://dx.doi.org/10.51492/cfwj.108.20													WOS:001025594100002

Furthermore, understanding the processes benefits from maps showing how the exchange changes during a tidal cycle, i.e., on an hourly-to-daily timescale, and with river discharge, which varies seasonally. Conventional water masks are not updated regularly and they do not always include seasonally active narrow channels in the inland areas which are required for the modelling. In this study, we use high resolution (similar to 6m) airborne Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) images to map water channels and areas with discernible water level increase using data acquired for the Delta-X mission. The SAR intensity difference in multiple polarization channels and interferometric coherence are used to differentiate water channels from land areas, and the water channel masks produced are able to identify most channels with width >20m. We also developed a method combining interferometric amplitude and phase to identify areas with significant water depth change along the edges of small channels. Geocoded channel masks were produced for UAVSAR tracks covering two deltas (Wax Lake and Terrebonne) in coastal Louisiana for both low tide and high tide acquisitions. The methods developed can be extended to other deltas worldwide.

The flood disaster of lakes not only causes direct economic loss, but also breaks down the social order. Chao Lake, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is one of the five major freshwater lakes in China with the area of 780 square kilometers. The dynamic monitoring of floods in the Chao Lake plays a crucial role in preventing flood disasters in the Anhui. This paper used CNNs to detect the flooded area of the Chao Lake from the Gaofen-3 SAR imagery from July and September 2020, July 2021, and August 2022. Then, the water area and water level were calculated to conduct a further quantitative analysis.

We show that the diversity index was low, pointing out a high level of Bacillariophyta dominance. Moreover, environmental variables show significant relationships with phytoplankton abundance. Seasonal variations of phytoplankton abundance, species composition, and their interaction with environmental parameters were investigated in the Azad Dam Lake, in the West of Iran during 2015-2016. Sampling was conducted seasonally at five stations in the lake. Multivariate statistical analyses were carried out to define the abiotic variables influencing phytoplankton community composition. A total of 51 taxa of phytoplankton belonging to six phyla were identified. Bacillariophyta (diatoms) were most diverse with 22 taxa, comprised more than 90% of the total density. Despite the low Shannon-Wiener index (H ') diversity (0.10-1.54), pointing out the dominant density of Bacillariophyta resulted in high water quality. Statistical analysis showed seasonal phytoplankton assemblages differences indicating a biogeographical gradient. Distance-based Linear Model (DisTLM) analysis displayed six environmental variables showing significant relationships with the phytoplankton abundance in the resemblance matrix (p < 0.05). Based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the combination of total phosphorus (TP), water temperature (WT), Secchi disc depth (SD), total nitrogen (TN), nitrite (NO2-), and dissolved oxygen (DO) by the DisTLM model elucidated 63.1% of the total variability. Since the dam is newly constructed and has not yet been exploited, and the factors caused by human activities that threaten the lake have not yet spread much, findings of the present study suggest Azad Dam Lake appears to have been not highly affected by anthropogenic activities up to now.

The climatic signal imparted in the chronology is conditioned mainly by the direct influence of environmental factors on the isotopic signature of source water, which in turn is regulated by evaporation and condensation mechanisms. The second driver of stable oxygen isotope is the physiological response of trees to changing weather conditions, most importantly rates of transpiration. The chronology of stable oxygen isotopes corresponds well with both temperature (r = 0.485; p < 0.05) and total precipitation (r = -0.548; p < 0.05) during the growing season (May-September). This mixed signal results from the fact that the relationship between the content of stable oxygen isotopes and the influence of climate is multifactorial. Moreover, the effect exerted by meteorological conditions on stable isotope ratio changes over time.

In our previous paper (Mabika et al. 2019) we provided information on the seasonal occurrence of metazoan parasites of H. vittatus. This communication provides endohelminth infection statistics of male and female H. vittatus across two seasons not previously included. A total of 80 H. vittatus individuals consisting of 56 females and 24 males were examined for endohelminth parasites during the period October 2014-July 2015 in the Sanyati basin, Lake Kariba. Parasites were recovered from the abdominal cavity, mesentery and intestines. Most of the parasites were harboured in the abdominal cavity in both sexes. Parasite infection was more prevalent during the dry season in comparison to the rainy season for both sexes. Contracaecum larval infection was significantly higher in female (84%) than in male tigerfish (24%), whereas larval cestode infections were significantly higher in male tigerfish (59%) than female fish (16%). The mean condition factor of the male tigerfish (1.68) was not significantly higher than that of the female (1.64). The results of the study indicate that female tigerfish were more suitable hosts to Contracaecum larval infection than the male fish. Further parasitological and histopathological research on tigerfish is recommended to contribute to knowledge on endohelminth diversity and conservation.

We employed the quadrat method of population estimation with three repetitions using 10x50 mm binoculars between 06:00 and 08:00 h. We recorded population fluctuations in August and September (immigration season) and April and May (emigration season). We counted a maximum population of 112,000 Wilson's Phalaropes during the immigration season, and then in the emigration season. During their stay of approximately 8 months, the birds feed on water fleas, insects and detritus amounted to 146,496 t. The inner bay of Lake Titicaca is an important aquatic habitat for these migratory birds, which has a positive impact on the contribution to the decontamination of the lake.

Primary productivity is mainly driven by light intensity, temperature, availability of nutrients, and distribution of the ionic species of the carbonate system in the respective depths of the euphotic zone. It is a complex system that is very difficult to simulate in the laboratory. This cheap, transportable, and easy-to-build floating barge allows measuring the primary productivity accurately-directly under the actual natural conditions. The methodology is based on measuring the primary productivity in real time using noninvasive oxygen sensors integrated into tightly sealed glass jars, enabling online oxygen flux monitoring and providing new insights into metabolic activities. Detailed seasonal in situ measurements of gross primary productivity of microbial mats (or other benthic organisms) can improve current knowledge of the processes controlling primary productivity dynamics in lentic waters.

Planktonic and Benthic Algocoenoses in Highly Mineralized Rivers that Drain into Lake Elton	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												This paper presents results of long-term (2008 and 2012-2019) studies of phytoplankton and phytobenthos in seven highly mineralized rivers of the Lake Elton basin. Two-hundred-and-fourteen algal taxa belonging to seven systematic divisions have been identified in the algal flora; of them, the division Bacillariophyta features the greatest species richness and abundance. A comparative analysis of the taxonomic structure and species diversity of algocoenoses in the mineralization gradient was performed. The following structure-forming species represented by widespread euryhaline taxa were identified: Chaetoceros muelleri Lemm., Conticribra weissflogii (Grun.) S. Suchoples et Williams, Nitzschia closterium Ehr., Halamphora coffeaeformis (Ag.) Meresch., and Achnanthesbrevipes Ag., (Bacillariophyta), as well as Cyanoprokaryota (Phormidium breve (Kutz. ex Gom.) Anagn. & Kom., Oscillatoria limosa Ag. ex Gom., O. tenuis Ag. ex Gom., and Geitlerinema amphibium (Ag. ex Gom.) Anagn.). Species of the genus Dunaliella (Chlorophyta) predominate in rivers featuring critical salinity conditions. It is established that the abundance and biomass of algae in algocoenoses vary in a wide range and do not depend on the mineralization level. In mesohaline rivers, the negative correlation between specific species richness and mineralization is weak; while in polyhaline rivers, it is statistically significant (R = -0.50, R = -0.52, p < 0.05). Seasonal dynamics of planktonic algocoenoses is manifested by changes in the species structure, abundance, and biomass.																			2079-0961	2079-0988				DEC	2022	12	4					516	524		10.1134/S2079096122040059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S2079096122040059													WOS:000878692600019

Evaluating At-Risk Black Ash Wetlands as Biodiversity Hotspots in Northern Forests	WETLANDS												Black ash (Fraxinus nigra) forests, which cover over 1.2 million hectares in the Great Lakes Region, are threatened by emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis), which is eliminating native populations of ash throughout the region. Understanding the contribution of black ash wetlands to local and regional species richness is critical in forming effective conservation policies and informing management plans for these imperiled habitats. We measured breeding bird and anuran communities in black ash wetlands and compared them to nearby non-black ash habitats for each taxa: aspen-dominated upland forest for birds and emergent wetlands for anurans. Our results showed black ash wetlands support unique communities of birds but not of anurans. For birds, black ash wetlands had higher species richness and a greater number of birds that were indicator species compared to upland forests; this is likely due the presence of a water component and more structural diversity in black ash wetlands compared to aspen-dominated aspen forests. In contrast, emergent wetlands had higher richness of breeding anurans and greater number indicator species than black ash wetlands; this reflects a general preference by North American anurans to breed in more open canopy habitats. If EAB invades these systems, expected increases in ponding and canopy openness may be beneficial for some anuran species during the breeding season, but loss of the forest canopy could result in significant changes in bird community composition. Our results indicate that implementing management strategies that focus on emulating structural complexity of black ash wetlands will be beneficial for conserving wildlife diversity.					; D'Amato, Anthony/AAV-3245-2021	Grinde, Alexis/0000-0001-7141-0494; Youngquist, Melissa/0000-0003-2721-1871													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2022	42	8							122	10.1007/s13157-022-01632-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-022-01632-9													WOS:000894425600001

Seasonal Changes in the Spatial Structure of Zoobenthos in Lake Yuzhny Volos (Belarus)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The spatial structure of the zoobenthos in Lake Yuzhny Volos is studied in the different seasons of the year. The types of seasonal distribution of total abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos, its main taxonomic groups, and individual species and the influence of key environmental factors on them (dissolved oxygen and temperature) are determined. There are two peaks of quantitative metrics of zoobenthos. The first peak was due to macrophytes, where Dreissena polymorpha, Asellus aquaticus, and different types of chironomids dominated on all seasons. The second peak was due to the development of the relict crustacean Monoporeia affinis.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				DEC	2022	15	6			SI		866	874		10.1134/S1995082922060104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082922060104													WOS:000900128400015
J	Larson, JH; Bailey, SW; Evans, MA				Larson, James H.; Bailey, Sean W.; Evans, Mary Anne			Biofouling of a unionid mussel by dreissenid mussels in nearshore zones of the Great Lakes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												In North America, native unionid mussels are imperiled due to factors such as habitat degradation, pollution, and invasive species. One of the most substantial threats is that posed by dreissenid mussels, which are invasive mussels that attach to hard substrates including unionid shells and can restrict movement and feeding of unionids. This dreissenid mussel biofouling of unionids varies spatially in large ecosystems, such as the Great Lakes, with some areas having low enough biofouling to form effective refugia where unionid mussels might persist. Here, we measured biofouling on mussels suspended in cages over the growing season (generally first week in June to last week of August) over 3 years in nearshore areas in Lake Erie (2014-2016), Lake Michigan (Grand Traverse Bay, 2015 and Green Bay, 2016), and Lake Huron (2015). Biofouling varied substantially by years within Lake Erie, with increasingly higher biofouling rates each year. Although dreissenid mussels are present throughout these lakes, we observed very low biofouling in Grand Traverse Bay (Lake Michigan) and Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron), with no dreissenid mussels in 8 of 9 sites across these two bays. Sampling in the rivermouth of the Fox River (Wisconsin) and the Maumee River (Ohio) both showed very high biofouling in areas adjacent to the outlet of these tributaries into Green Bay and Maumee Bay (Lake Erie), respectively. These watersheds are dominated by agriculture, and we would expect high growth of primary producers (i.e., mussel food) and primary consumers (unionids and zebra mussels) in these areas compared to the other sampled bays or the open waters of the Great Lakes.

Nonlethal Tools to Identify Mass Ovarian Follicular Atresia in Burbot	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Skipped spawning, or variation in spawning periodicity, occurs in many annual spawning fish species and is an important consideration for population management. We assessed plasma sex steroid concentrations and measured gonad size and ovarian follicle diameter as metrics to nonlethally identify mass ovarian follicular atresia, which may contribute to skipped spawning in Burbot Lota lota. We maintained wild fish in captivity and exposed them to increasing water temperatures during a 3-wk period before the spawning season to induce mass ovarian follicular atresia. We collected ovarian follicles, blood plasma, and gonadal sonograms from fish weekly between January 28, 2018, and March 25, 2018. We histologically analyzed ovarian follicles to confirm stage of maturity. We measured concentrations of plasma sex steroids testosterone (T) and estradiol-17b (E2) by radioimmunoassay. We measured gonad diameter and circumference by ultrasonography and ovarian follicle diameter by image analysis. Mean plasma T concentration decreased from 8.94 ng/mL during late vitellogenesis to 1.83 ng/mL during atresia, suggesting that plasma T concentrations may be used to identify mass ovarian follicular atresia. We do not recommend using plasma E2 concentrations to identify mass ovarian follicular atresia because E2 concentrations rapidly decreased during the completion of vitellogenesis and the initiation of atresia in Burbot; therefore, plasma E2 may not accurately identify mass ovarian follicular atresia. Mean gonad diameter measured by ultrasonography decreased from 4.05 cm during late vitellogenesis to 3.65 cm during atresia. Mean diameter of ovarian follicles decreased during the final week of the study, suggesting that ovarian follicle diameter may be used to identify advanced mass ovarian follicular atresia. The nonlethal tools assessed-plasma sex steroid concentrations, ultrasonography, and ovarian follicle diameter-enable fisheries biologists to determine the occurrence and frequency of mass ovarian follicular atresia among Burbot in Lake Roosevelt and may be applied to other Burbot populations.

Self-Organization and Disorganization of Ultra-High-Pressure Ice-Dam Basin (Chuya-Kurai Natural Phenomenon, Gornyi Altai)	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												New results from studying the possible mechanisms of formation and degradation of the Chuya-Kurai ultra-high-pressure ice-dammed lake are presented. The conclusions are based on an analysis of the climatic hydrothermal regime, which governs the development of the processes of self-freezing of the ice dam and its subsequent degradation. According to updated data, at the maximum filling to the absolute level of 2133 m, the depth of the paleolake is 657 m, the volume of water is 753 km(3), the water area is 3054 km(2), and the maximum hydrostatic pressure is 65 kg/cm(2) (6.37MPa/cm(2)). The drainage of the lake basin is accompanied by the formation of 200 abrasive-accumulative terraces on the slopes of the basins in a height range of 1530-2133 m. A quantitative assessment of the formation time of one abrasive terrace in periglacial conditions is made, as is an estimation of the duration of the action of wind-wave processes for the development of abrasion: it did not exceed 90 days of a warm season. The water layers drained during the year through the thermal erosion channels of the ice dam are determined by the difference in the heights of the abrasive terraces. The duration of the existence of an ice-dammed lake has been clarified. The study used current quantitative data on measuring the average annual flow rate of the Chuya River at the nearest Chagan-Uzun hydrological post. Calculations have shown that the filling of the lake basin to the maximum volume of water of 753 km(3) (taking into account the water accumulating in the ice dam, 68 km(3) (total V = 821 km(3))) is carried out for 5324 years. The duration of water discharge, determined by the number of abrasion terraces, is no more than 200 years. The frequency of retrogression of the lake level, equal to 20 years, has been revealed. Apparently, it is caused by climatic fluctuations: changes in cooling and warming.

This study investigated nursery grounds, habitat shifts, and potential energy sources for juvenile Labeobarbus species. Electrofishing point abundance sampling for juvenile sampling and stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) were applied to trace potential energy sources. Habitat use shifting was observed among labeobarbus size classes from weak or no flow pool to fast-flowing riffle mesohabitats. The young-of-the-year (YOY) were mainly found in microhabitats with a weak to moderate water velocity (i.e., < 0.3 m s (1)), while 1(+) juveniles (>7 cm FL) adapted to velocities of > 0.3 m s (1). Juveniles suffered from limited access to run and riffle habitats during the peak dry season (March-April). They were subsequently exposed to resource competition and predation risk which led to lower catches. Juveniles of different size classes used different food sources. C1 (<3 cm) and C3 (5.1-7 cm) size classes mainly relied on algal sources, while C2 (3 - 5 cm) and C4 (>7 cm) on zooplankton. Insect larvae were a relatively important source for larger juveniles. Maintaining appropriate flow that permits juveniles to access preferred foraging and nursery habitat in the Gumara River is crucial for the sustainable management and conservation of the Labeobarbus population in Lake Tana.

The studies were conducted in the period from 2018 to 2020. The chemical composition of the water in the studied lakes differed significantly from that of the lakes located in the background territories of the region. High values of pH and mineralization, increased concentrations of major ions and elevated content of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were recorded in the surface waters. The nutrient concentrations were subject to noticeable seasonal fluctuations, mainly due to their consumption by phytoplankton, as well as to the changes in the ratios of surface and underground runoff. Lake Ledovoe (the central part of Murmansk) was the most polluted among the studied lakes, and Lake Bolshoe (used for drinking supply of the city) was the least polluted. Assessing the trophic status of the Murmansk lakes showed that the studied lakes are mostly mesotrophic, except for Lake Bolshoe (oligotrophic) and Lake Ledovoe (hypertrophic). In most of the lakes, phosphorus was the limiting factor for the growth and development of phytoplankton. The data obtained can be useful for understanding the fundamental processes of water composition transformation in the urbanized territories of the Arctic regions of the world and for making managerial (practical) decisions to create a comfortable urban environment in the North of Russia.
