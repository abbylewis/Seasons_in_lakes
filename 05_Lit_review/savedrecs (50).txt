They are key players in soils, but little is known about their role in aquatic systems. Here, we report on the design and evaluation of a 16S rRNA-targeted probe set for the identification of Verrucomicrobia and of clades within this phylum. Subsequently, the probe set was applied to a study concerning the seasonal abundance of Verrucomicrobia in waters of the humic lake Grosse Fuchskuhle (Germany) by catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization. The lake hosted diverse Verrucomicrobia clades in all seasons. Either Spartobacteria (up to 19%) or Opitutus spp. (up to 7%) dominated the communities, whereas Prosthecobacter spp. were omnipresent in low numbers (< 1%). Verrucomicrobial abundance and community composition varied between the seasons, and between more and less humic basins, but were rather stable in oxic and seasonally anoxic waters.

Lake Kinneret (Israel) experienced multiannual periods of sole domination by the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense and periods dominated seasonally by P. gatunense or cyanobacteria. Extensive studies have been carried out in both lakes regarding the role of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus as drivers of primary productivity. There is growing evi-dence that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compounds also influence not only biomass and structure of phytoplankton communities but also microcystin production. This study focuses on relationships of DON with: (1) population dynamics of Microcystis spp. and concentrations of microcystins in Lake Suwa, and (2) population dynamics of P. gatunense as well as N-and non-N-fixing cyanobacteria in Lake Kinneret. Modelling results for historical data of Lake Suwa by means of the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA revealed that the prediction of abundances of four Microcystis species and concentrations of cyanotoxins achieved higher coefficients of corre-lation when DON/DIN-ratios were included as drivers. Population dynamics of P. gatunense in Lake Kinneret appeared to have a strong inverse relationships with DON/DIN-ratios reflected by inferential models of HEA with higher coefficients of correlation when driven by DON/DIN-ratios. When DON/DIN-ratios were included as drivers, models of Microcystis spp. in Lake Kinneret performed higher coefficients of determination compared to models of N-fixing cyanobacteria. The study highlights the need to consider DON for improved understanding and management of population dynamics of cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates in freshwater lakes.					박, 호동/JRY-4612-2023	Recknagel, Friedrich/0000-0002-1028-9413; Park, Ho-Dong/0000-0003-0649-303X													1568-9883	1878-1470				MAY	2022	114								102229	10.1016/j.hal.2022.102229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2022.102229		MAR 2022						35550299					WOS:000791224100003

Hybrid Predictive Model for Water Quality Monitoring Based on Sentinel-2A L1C Data	IEEE ACCESS												Monitoring water quality is an important challenge in both developed and developing countries. Remote sensing data can form a highly frequent dataset with acceptable spatial coverage that can be used to remotely monitor water quality. This paper presents a novel automated model for remotely monitoring water quality to address the problem of insufficient samples and save the time and cost of sample collection. The proposed model estimates both optical and non-optical water quality parameters via Sentinel-2A data. A bio-inspired hybrid model of a Binary Whale Optimization Algorithm (BWOA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (BWOA-ANN) is applied to determine the relationship between extracted refiectance values from Sentinel-2A images and analyzed samples. The novelty of this model is to solve two main problems of remote water quality monitoring: poor applicability and low non-optical parameter estimation accuracy. For the first problem, a proposed fully automated model with band selection using the BWOA to automatically select the optimal features (Sentinel-2A bands) that are suitable for each water quality parameter. The second problem is addressed by automatically detecting the relationship between non-optical parameters, such as the total phosphorus, and optical parameters, such as chlorophyll-a. Three datasets with different locations, seasons, and parameters were selected to test the proposed BWOA-ANN. The experimental results demonstrated good regression with a mean R2 value of 0.916 for optical parameters and 0.890 for non-optical parameters. The proposed model was found to outperform the ANN with an R2 value higher by 40% and 52% for the optical and non-optical parameters, respectively.					; Hassan, Gehad/ABD-1994-2020; Goher, Mohamed El Sherif/G-4369-2011; Goher, Mohamed/G-4369-2011	Shaheen, Masoud/0000-0003-4853-3415; , Shereen/0000-0002-3067-7173; Hassan, Gehad/0000-0002-3506-1001; Goher, Mohamed El Sherif/0000-0001-9377-2429; 													2169-3536						2021	9						65730	65749		10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3075849													WOS:000647304400001
J	Nagorka, R; Duffek, A				Nagorka, Regine; Duffek, Anja			Under the influence of regulations: spatio-temporal trends of the UV filter 2-Ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) in German rivers	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE												Background: Globally, 2-Ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) is one of the most commonly used UV filters in sunscreen and personal care products. Due to its widespread usage, the occurrence of EHMC in the aquatic environment has frequently been documented. In the EU, EHMC is listed under the European Community Rolling Action Plan (CoRAP) as suspected to be persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) and as a potential endocrine disruptor. It was included in the first watch list under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) referring to a sediment PNEC of 200 mu g/kg dry weight (dw). In the light of the ongoing substance evaluation to refine the environmental risk assessment, the objective of this study was to obtain spatio-temporal trends for EHMC in freshwater. We analyzed samples of suspended particulate matter (SPM) retrieved from the German environmental specimen bank (ESB). The samples covered 13 sampling sites from major German rivers, including Rhine, Elbe, and Danube, and have been collected since mid-2000s. Results: Our results show decreasing concentrations of EHMC in annual SPM samples during the studied period. In the mid-2000s, the levels for EHMC ranged between 3.3 and 72 ng/g dw. The highest burden could be found in the Rhine tributary Saar. In 2017, we observed a maximum concentration ten times lower (7.9 ng/g dw in samples from the Saar). In 62% of all samples taken in 2017, concentrations were even below the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 2.7 ng/g dw. Conclusions: The results indicate a general declining discharge of EHMC into German rivers within the last 15 years and correspond to the market data. Although the measured levels are below the predicted no-effect level (PNEC) in sediment, further research should identify local and seasonal level of exposure, e.g., at highly frequented bathing waters especially in lakes. In addition, possible substitutes as well as their potentially synergistic effects together with other UV filters should be investigated.

The [Hg] measured in surface sediments and biota varied inversely between wet and dry seasons. Increased rainfall and water disturbance during the wet season are suggested as the main factors releasing Hg from surface sediments and enhancing the bioavailability of Hg to biota. The elevated Hg levels associated with the leaf stage suggested that litterfall and atmospheric deposition may be the main Hg inputs into mangrove food webs. The positive relationships between log [Hg] and delta N-15 provided evidence for Hg biomagnification, however low trophic magnification slopes in both seasons indicated that the ecological risk of Hg in the wetland would be negligible. The [Hg] in fish and commercial crabs were below the permitted limits for human consumption.

J	Wu, CX; Li, B; Xiong, NX				Wu, Chunxue; Li, Bin; Xiong, Naixue			An Effective Machine Learning Scheme to Analyze and Predict the Concentration of Persistent Pollutants in the Great Lakes	IEEE ACCESS												Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are highly toxic and difficult to degrade in the natural ecology, which has a severe negative impact on the ecological environment. Quantifying changes in the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants in the Great Lakes is challenging work. Machine learning (ML) methods are potent predictors that have recently achieved impressive performance on time series tasks. ARIMA model, Linear Regression methods, XGBoost algorithm, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are commonly used for estimating time-series changes. Traditionally Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) have been standard criteria to measure the error between the actual value and predicted value; however, Euclidean distance (ED) cannot effectively calculate the similarity between two-time series. We proposed an alternative criterion called Penalty Dynamic Time Wrapping (Penalty-DTW) based on Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW). It can accurately measure the difference between the actual value and the predicted value. We study the benefits of Penalty-DTW vs. ED under the above ML algorithms. Further, considering the machine learning algorithm's uncertainty, we proposed combining LSTM and deep ensemble methods to quantify algorithms uncertainty and make a confident prediction. We find improved LSTM model outperformed other predictive power models by comparing pollutant concentration prediction. The prediction results show that the concentration of pollutants has a stable downward trend in recent years. Simultaneously, we found that pollutants' concentration correlates with seasons, which positively guides environmental pollution control in the Great Lakes.

As the basis and essential condition of economic and social development, water-related infrastructures provide the material basis and guarantee for regulating and storing surface water resources and solving multi-dimensional water problems. The infrastructures that play an important role in surface water resource regulation and storage mainly include three types: Gray (such as dams), green (such as forests), and blue infrastructures (such as lakes). Gray infrastructures can reduce the flood peak and increase water supply during dry seasons by regulating and storing water so that the seasonal and inter-annual fluctuation of runoff is reduced, which plays an important role in water storage, water supply, flood control, and disaster mitigation. However, excessive gray infrastructures would have adverse effects on the social economy and environmental ecology. Unlike gray infrastructures, green and blue infrastructures can not only benefit water resource management but also have ecological functions, such as improving water quality and enhancing ecosystem services. Thus. it is significant to couple gray, green, and blue infrastructures to regulate the spatio-temporal distribution of water resources. However, research on the spatial distribution and temporal variation of water storage capacity is still lacking, which hinders the coordinated regulation and comprehensive management of surface water resources. Therefore, in the present study, the spatio-temporal distribution of the three aforementioned infrastructures was compared and analyzed on basin scale, based on the latest data of darns, root zone storage capacity, natural lakes, and so on. Results indicated the following: (1) Gray water storage capacity has exceeded that of the natural terrestrial surface ecosystem in the Yangtze River Basin and the Southeast Basins, where human activities are intense. (2) Gray water storage capacity has increased significantly in nine major basins from 1955 to 2020, but the timing of construction varies in different basins. (3) Green water storage capacity did not change much, the Songhua-Liaohe River Basin and the Huaihe River Basin increased slightly. (4) Blue water storage capacity shows a constantly increasing trend on the whole, in which the water storage capacity in the inland river basin (including the endorheic basin on the Tibetan Plateau) significantly increased. Our study revealed the basic information and spatio-temporal variation of gray-green-blue water storage capacities in nine major basins of China, which could lead to better coordination between natural and artificial water infrastructures and provide support for multidimensional optimization of water resource allocation.

This article presents an improved deformation model combining environmental factors (i.e., precipitation and temperature) with hydrogeological parameters to separate the saline-soil deformation from the aquifer deformation over Qarhan Salt Lake, China. First, the vertical ground deformation was derived by 119 ascending and 113 descending synthetic aperture radar images of Sentinel-1A collected from July 2015 to May 2020. Subsequently, we estimated the deformation components derived from temperature, precipitation, seasonal oscillation, magnitude, and decay coefficient of the hydrodynamic function by the proposed deformation model. The estimated deformation and decay coefficient maps pinpoint the existing and previously unknown faults. Next, we compared our proposed prototype with the sinusoidal and exponentially decaying model to present the reliability and efficiency in separating the deformation components and estimating the decay coefficient. Finally, we collected the stratigraphic data from 50 drilling wells to validate our model results by simulating the cumulative silt and clay layers (aquitard) thickness utilizing the Ordinary Kriging interpolation method. Findings show that by quantifying the aquitard thickness in the drilling wells, there is a strong relationship in the spatial distribution between cumulative thickness and the decay coefficient. The results suggested that both the decay coefficient and the aquitard-layer thickness can be used as the vital parameters to partition hydrogeological units, which provides an opportunity to detect and mitigate the potential geological hazards in the saline mudflat.					; Xie, Lingxiao/ABE-7593-2020; mao, wenfei/JXN-3224-2024; xiang, wei/IWD-8393-2023; liu, guoxiang/I-8174-2013	Zhang, Rui/0000-0002-0809-7682; xiang, wei/0000-0002-8756-2211; Pirasteh, Saied/0000-0002-3177-037X													1939-1404	2151-1535					2021	14						11134	11147		10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3123514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3123514													WOS:000717769500004

Therefore, this study utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) geospatial technology to acquire 124 remotely sensed images to explore the spatial and temporal changes of the four seasons of Poyang Lake from 1987 to 2019. The official statistics from relevant cities are used to quantitatively reveal the main driving factors of water body changes in Poyang Lake. Temporally, the water body area of Poyang Lake shows an obvious downward trend in general. Spatially, the water body area of Poyang Lake shows a gradual decrease from the center of the lake to the surroundings. In 1987-1998, the water body area of Poyang Lake showed an increasing trend, with an increase of about 727.90km(2). From 1998 to 2006, the water body area of Poyang Lake mainly showed a decreasing trend, with a decrease of 401.58km(2). The water body area of Poyang Lake increased slowly during 2006-2017. Anthropogenic factors and natural factors have influenced the changes in water body area of Poyang Lake to a certain extent. This study can provide valuable supporting data for the comprehensive environmental management and flood hazard monitoring of Poyang Lake.					; Zhu, Linye/KHZ-9793-2024	Zhu, Linye/0000-0002-2125-6860; Yang, Fengshuo/0000-0002-9755-0687; 													1230-1485	2083-5906					2021	30	5					4389	4399		10.15244/pjoes/131056	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/131056													WOS:000680010300006

Experimental observation was performed to analyze processes in the glacier-snow zone, alpine cold desert zone, marsh meadow zone, alpine shrub zone, and mountain grassland zone based on the isotopic and hydrochemical analyses of glacier, snow, frozen soil, groundwater, and other water sources in the headwater catchment of the alpine cold region. delta O-18 and delta D values of precipitation and various water bodies in Mafengou River Basin exhibited strong seasonal variations. Precipitation and various water bodies were rich in delta O-18 and delta D during the wet season and relatively negative in delta O-18 and delta D during the dry season. The isotopic content of various water bodies in Mafengou River Basin was dependent on temperature, elevation of the recharge area, and amount of precipitation. Lower temperatures were typically associated with lower delta O-18 and delta D values and are believed to be mainly responsible for the seasonal patterns observed in the isotopic values of various water bodies in Mafengou River Basin in the alpine cold region. Seasonal variations were larger in streams where recent precipitation is the main source of the flow and smaller in streams where groundwater is the dominant source of water.

Effect of eutrophication on the distribution of arsenic species in eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Effects of eutrophication on arsenic speciation were studied in eutrophic Lake Kiba and mesotrophic Lake Biwa, Japan. By combining hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry with ultraviolet irradiation, inorganic, methyl and ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic were determined. In both Lakes, inorganic species (As(V + III)) dominated over other forms of arsenic all the year round. Most of methylarsenic fraction was dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), and the concentration of monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA) was below the detection limit. Measurements of size-fractioned arsenic concentrations in water column indicate that most of the DMAA was distributed in truly dissolved fraction (< 10 kDa), while ultraviolet-labile fractions were distributed in particulate (> 0.45 mu m) and colloidal (10 kDa-0.45 mu m) fractions. Arsenic speciation in eutrophic Lake Kiba fluctuated greatly with season. The ultraviolet-labile fractions were observed with the increase of DMAA from May to October, and they disappeared with the decrease of DMAA in January. In mesotrophic Lake Biwa, the ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic were not influenced as much as those in eutrophic Lake Kiba. On the other hand DMAA concentration was higher in Lake Biwa compared to that in Lake Kiba. The results suggest that the biosynthesis of complex organoarsenicals was enhanced by eutrophication, and the arsenic speciation would be influenced by the balance of biological processes in natural waters.

Methane Production in a Temperate Freshwater Lake during an Intense Cyanobacterial Bloom	MICROBIOLOGY												Seasonal cyanobacterial blooms have a negative impact on freshwater ecosystems. The role of cyanobacteria in methane production and their relationship with methanogenic archaea are not yet well understood. The goal of the present work was to identify the features of methanogenesis in the water column and sediments of a profundal part of the freshwater Lake Senezh (Moscow oblast) during a period of cyanobacterial over-bloom. Analytical, radiotracer, microscopic, molecular biological, and incubation techniques were used. Alkalization and oxygen oversaturation of the 0-2-m water layer were caused by intensive photosynthesis. The near-bottom water (4 m) was pH-neutral and hypoxic; the sediments were reduced. Methane was detected throughout the water column; its concentration in the surface water was an order of magnitude lower than in the near-bottom water and 4 orders of magnitude lower than in the sediments. Cyanobacteria of the species Microcystisaeruginosa predominated in the photic zone (up to 30% of the total number of the 16S rRNA gene fragments). The sequences of cyanobacteria and freshwater members of the SAR11 clade, which can potentially be involved in aerobic methanogenesis via decomposition of methylphosphonates (MPn), were also detected. The sequences of hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the genus Methanoregula, which are potentially capable of methanogenesis in cooperation with cyanobacteria, were revealed in oxygen-supersaturated water. Hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic pathways of methanogenesis predominated in reduced sediments. Sequences of methanogens of the orders Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriales, Methanosarciniales, and Methanomassiliicoccales were detected there. Cyanobacterial bloom promoted methanogenesis both in the photic zone of Lake Senezh (due to MPn decomposition and anaerobic methanogenesis in association with cyanobacterial aggregates) and in the near-bottom water and sediments (due to oxygen depletion and excessive release of substrates caused by sedimentation and degradation of cyanobacterial mortmass).

Carbon Stocks and Recent Rates of Carbon Sequestration in Nutrient-Rich Freshwater Wetlands From Lake Simcoe Watershed (Southern Canada)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												We examined soil properties and accumulation rates over the last ca. 100 years in four swamps and four marshes in southern Canada where these wetlands are common but under increasing anthropogenic pressure. One 50-cm long core was collected from each wetland and analyzed to determine bulk density (BD) and organic matter (OM). Lead-210 and cesium-137 dating were used to estimate sediment accumulation rates. In the datable portion of each core, we determined the organic carbon (Corg), nitrogen (N), Corg/OM, Corg/N, Corg density, Corg stocks, and Corg accumulation rates. All parameters but one-Corg accumulation rates-were significantly different in swamps compared to marshes and between seasonally wet soils and those regularly flooded. Since 1950, Corg stocks varied from 6 to 13.6 kg m-2 with & AP;23% more Corg in swamps than in marshes. When hydrology and deeper soils where considered, Corg stocks in regularly flooded wetlands were 60% higher than those of seasonally wet systems, emphasizing the role of hydrology in building up C stocks long-term. Our measurements are within the wide range reported for similar systems in North America. The average rate of Corg accumulation in the studied wetlands (112 & PLUSMN; 87 g m-2 yr-1) is & AP;50% higher than that of oligotrophic/ombrotrophic peatlands, but & AP;47% lower than in tidal marshes from eastern Canada. Our study lends support to the case for wetland restoration through re-wetting as an important nature-based climate solution for mitigation of GHG emissions in areas where they were drained for agriculture and other purposes. Wetlands are important ecosystems because they have an enhanced capacity to extract carbon dioxide-a greenhouse gas-from the atmosphere and store it in the ground as partly decomposed plant carbon. This ground storage is vital because it keeps carbon dioxide from increasing in the atmosphere where it causes global warming. Among the Earth's wetlands, freshwater marshes and swamps from temperate climates are among the least understood. To address this limitation, we conducted a study in southern Canada, where these wetlands are common but under increasing pressure from farming and urban development. Our results indicate that while marshes (dominated by grasses and sedges) form mostly mineral soils with less carbon stocks than swamps (vegetated with shrubs and trees), which form organic soils, the rate at which they accumulate carbon in their soil is similar. We also show that the wetlands we studied are 50% more effective in storing carbon than the cold climate bogs (vegetated by mosses), but they are less effective than salt marshes which form along the shores of temperate seas. We suggest that if freshwater marshes and swamps are protected, they can be important natural solutions in the mitigation of carbon dioxide emitted by human activity. Carbon stocks in eight nutrient-rich freshwater wetlands ranged 18-40 kg m-2, with organic soils averaging & AP;60% more than mineral soilsMean carbon accumulation rate over the last 100 years was 112 g m-2 yr1, with no significant differences between swamps and marshesCarbon accumulation rates were higher than in oligotrophic/ombrotrophic wetlands (bogs) but lower than in tidal salt marshes					; Chmura, Gail/LNI-4648-2024	Pendea, Florin/0009-0000-6525-8887; Chmura, Gail/0000-0001-7163-3903; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT	2023	128	10							e2023JG007561	10.1029/2023JG007561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JG007561													WOS:001073039600001

Integrated assessment of land use and cover changes in the Malagarasi river catchment in Tanzania	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					10th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWP-SA Symposium	OCT 28-30, 2009	Entebbe, UGANDA					Malagarasi river catchment represents one of the largest and most significant transboundary natural ecosystems in Africa. The catchment constitutes about one third of the catchment area of Lake Tanganyika and contains ecosystems of both national and international importance (i.e. Muyovozi Wetland Ramsar site). It has been increasingly said that increased anthropogenic activities have had negative impacts on the Muyovozi wetland in particular and other catchment resources. Nevertheless, these beliefs are little supported by quantitative data. A study on the dynamics of land use and cover in the Malagarasi river catchment therefore investigated long-term and seasonal changes that have occurred as a result of human activities in the area for the periods between 1984 and 2001. Landsat TM and ETM+ images were used to locate and quantify the changes. Perceptions of local people on historical changes and drivers for the changes were also collected and integrated in the assessment. The study revealed a significant change in land use and cover within a period of 18 year. Between 1984 and 2001, the woodland and wetland vegetation covers declined by 0.09% and 2.51% per year. Areas with settlements and cultivation increased by 1.05% annually while bushed grassland increased at 1.93% annually. The perceived principal drivers for the changes were found to include fire, cultivation along rivers and lake shores, overgrazing, poor law enforcement, insufficient knowledge on environmental issues, increasing poverty, deforestation and population growth. The human population growth rate stands at 4.8% against a national figure of 2.9%. The most perceived environmental problems include drying of streams and rivers, change in rainfall, loss of soil fertility, soil erosion and reduced crop yield. The study concludes that, there has been significant changes in land use and cover in the catchment and these require concerted actions to reverse the changes. The study highlights the importance of integrating remote sensing and local knowledge in understanding the dynamics catchment resources and generating information that could be used to overcome the catchment management problems.

The aim was to investigate whether chlorophyll content of the plants could be used as an indicator of brownification. The relationship between chlorophyll a and b (CHL a:b) of the petioles decreased with increasing water colour. The relationship between CHL a:b and turbidity was less clear. The sum concentration of chlorophyll a and b of the petioles did not respond to water colour consistently. The strong effect of water colour on petiole CHL a:b was probably due to the effect of colour on the attenuation of short-wavelength light. CHL b absorbs short-wavelength light more effectively than CHL a. To maximize the harvesting of short-wavelength light, macrophytes increase their CHL b concentration relative to CHL a. The results suggested that petiole CHL a:b of N. lutea can be used as an indicator of brownification. High phytoplankton biomass may, however, disturb the relationship between water colour and CHL a:b. Therefore, the most reliable results are obtained by sampling several times during the growing season. The floating leaves cannot be recommended as brownification indicators because the relationship between their CHL content and water colour is weak.					; Estlander, Satu/JUU-6679-2023	Rajala, Salla/0009-0005-6663-5038; Estlander, Satu/0000-0002-7197-3251													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2024	851	3					633	648		10.1007/s10750-023-05358-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05358-5		SEP 2023											WOS:001077829400001

Spatiotemporal Snowfall Variability in the Lake Michigan Region: How is Warming Affecting Wintertime Snowfall?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This study has investigated the spatiotemporal structure and changes in Lake Michigan snowfall for the period 1950-2013. With data quality caveats acknowledged, a larger envelope of stations was included than in previous studies to explore the data using time series analysis, principal component analysis, and geographic information systems. Results indicate warming in recent decades, a near-dearth of serial correlation, midwinter dependence on teleconnection patterns, strong sensitivity of snowfall to temperature, peak snowfall variability and dependence on temperature within the lake-effect belt, an increasing fraction of seasonal snowfall occurring from December to February, and temporal behavior consistent with the previously reported trend reversal in snowfall.					; Lyza, Anthony/JAX-6933-2023	Lyza, Anthony/0000-0002-8485-8666; 													1558-8424	1558-8432				AUG	2016	55	8					1813	1830		10.1175/JAMC-D-15-0285.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-15-0285.1													WOS:000383310400011

This study focuses on the relationships between particle size distribution (PSD), water's inherent optical properties (IOPs), and water constituents. We investigated the complex waters of Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, in wet and dry seasons during 2008-2011. Because of the distinct temporal-spatial variation of Poyang Lake, these parameters and relationships also demonstrate seasonal and regional variability. The variation range of the concentration of suspended particulate matter is 0.32-69.08 mg/l, with a mean value of 22.21 mg/l. The median particle size in the dry season is much larger than that of the wet season. The Junge distribution fits the PSD of Poyang Lake very well in the scope of 6.21-331 mu m. Furthermore, the slopes of the PSD range from 3.54 to 4.69, with a mean value of 4.11, with the steepest slopes (>4.5) occurring in the waters around Songmen Mountain Island and the northern waterway. A negative correlation was found between median particle size (D-v50) and the mass-specific absorption coefficient at 443 nm [a(p)(m) (443)] for both wet and dry seasons. Identical to analogous waters, the spectral slopes of the PSD correlate well with the spectral slopes of the attenuation coefficient, but with different fitted formulas. In the dry season, the particle size can better explain the variability of the scattering coefficient, while the mass-specific scattering coefficient is better explained by the apparent density. However, no similar results were found for the wet season. In addition, the spectral slopes of the backscattering coefficient correlated well with the PSD slope, and the bulk refractive index calculated from the backscattering ratio and PSD slope can indicate the particle composition of Poyang Lake. Overall, the knowledge on the PSD and IOPs gained in this study broadens our understanding of water optics in highly turbid water columns.

The effects of eutrophication and invasive species on zooplankton community dynamics in a shallow temperate lake	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Eutrophication (and associated cyanobacterial blooms) and biological invasions are increasingly common problems in aquatic ecosystems, yet their effects on zooplankton community dynamics are not well understood. We examined zooplankton community dynamics from 2005 to 2011 in a tidally-influenced shallow temperate lake (Vancouver Lake, Washington, USA), with particular emphasis on the effects of eutrophication and biological invasions. Cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses were used to explore interactions between the zooplankton community and multiple environmental stressors. Our results suggest that interannual differences in seasonal zooplankton community succession may be influenced directly by turbidity, cyanobacterial blooms, predatory zooplankton, and invasive crustacean zooplankton, and indirectly by PO4-P availability and temperature. Based on these results, we suggest that two separate management goals alleviating eutrophication and managing the spread of invasive species may be in conflict. We recommend future studies on the competition between native and non-native species to better understand the effects of cyanobacterial blooms on the success of non-native species, and the potential long-term consequences of non-native species invasions on zooplankton community dynamics.					; Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/Q-5520-2017	Rollwagen-Bollens, Gretchen/0000-0002-5127-5720; 													1863-9135					AUG	2016	188	3					215	231		10.1127/fal/2016/0816	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2016/0816													WOS:000381324600004

Evaluation of methods for the isolation, detection and quantification of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Cyanobacterial hepatotoxins such as microcystins and nodularins have been responsible for the poisoning of both animals and humans who ingest or come into contact with toxic blooms. They are extremely stable in water due to their stable chemical structure and can tolerate radical changes in water chemistry, including pH and salinity. Different methods for the extraction and detection of these compounds have been reported. Extraction methods utilizing both aqueous and organic solvent systems have been reported. The detection methods ranging from immunological or biochemical assays such as enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and enzyme activity assays, to chemicals methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and more sophisticated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have been documented as well. We review some important aspects of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins and methods of analysis for these toxins. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study focuses on analyzing the surface processes of Universidad Glacier, a benchmark glacier for the Dry Andes. Multiple remote sensing datasets are used alongside a novel spectral index designed for mapping of rock material located on the glacier's surface. Our findings highlight the precarious state of the glacier, which serves as a crucial water source for the region. The glacier exhibits locally varied debris accumulation and margin retreat. The most significant impacts are observed on the tongue and secondary accumulation cirques, with the latter at risk of disappearing. The debris cover on the tongue is expanding, reaching higher elevations, and is accompanied by glacier retreat, especially at higher altitudes. The equilibrium line is rapidly shifting upglacier, although the mid-season snow cover still frequently reaches the 2013 equilibrium line, even in 2020. Changes in stream density on the glacier tongue indicate an increased water supply in this area, likely due to enhanced melting of glacial ice. These observed processes align well with meteorological data obtained from reanalysis products. The behavior of dust and debris is influenced by precipitation amount, while the rate of retreat is linked to air temperature.					; Petlicki, Michal/H-7901-2016; Kinnard, Christophe/AAI-2468-2020; Petlicki, Michal/GPC-5755-2022	Podgorski, Julian/0000-0001-5604-3462; Petlicki, Michal/0000-0003-3383-2586; Kinnard, Christophe/0000-0002-4553-5258; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 20	2023	905								166907	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166907		SEP 2023						37704148					WOS:001088888300001

Abundant ROS generated in humic matter rich lakes include singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Because these ROS differ in half-life time and toxicity, we compared their effects on microbial activity (C-14-Leucine incorporation) and bacterial community composition (BCC) in surface waters of humic Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle (North-eastern Germany). For this purpose, experiments with water samples collected from the lake were conducted in July 2006, September 2008 and August 2009. Artificially increased O-1(2) and H2O2 concentrations inhibited microbial activity in water samples to a similar extent, but the effect of the respective ROS on BCC varied strongly. BCC analysis by 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and RT-PCR DGGE revealed ROS specific changes in relative abundance and activity of major bacterial groups and composition of dominating phylotypes. These changes were consistent in the three experiments performed in different years. The relative abundance of Polynucleobacter necessarius, Limnohabitans-related phylotypes (Betaproteobacteria), and Novosphingobium acidiphilum (Alphaproteobacteria) increased or was not affected by photo-sensitized O-1(2) exposure, but decreased after H2O2 exposure. The opposite pattern was found for Actinobacteria of the freshwater AcI-B cluster which were highly sensitive to O-1(2) but not to H2O2 exposure. Furthermore, group-specific RT-PCR DGGE analysis revealed that particle-attached P. necessarius and Limnohabitans-related phylotypes exhibit higher resistance to O-1(2) exposure compared to free-living populations. These results imply that O-1(2) acts as a factor in niche separation of closely affiliated Polynucleobacter and Limnohabitans-related phylotypes. Consequently, oxidative stress caused by photochemical ROS generation should be regarded as an environmental variable determining abundance, activity, and phylotype composition of environmentally relevant bacterial groups, in particular in illuminated and humic matter rich waters.

The seasonal variation of available phosphorus in soil profiles of three major paddy soils (Bai soil, Huangni soil and Wushan soil) during wheat and rice growth seasons was studied in the Taihu Lake region of China. The results were as follows: the available phosphorus contents differed in the three paddy soils. Available phosphorus content in Bai soil was the lowest in these soils. The available phosphorus content decreases rapidly with depth from the soil surface and reach the minimum value at approximately 45?cm before increasing slightly near the groundwater. The contents of available phosphorus were higher in February (tillering and shooting period of wheat) and in September (full heading time of rice) than in other months. The total phosphorus content strongly affects available phosphorus content in the studied soils. During the period of wheat cultivation, they show a typical power function relationship with correlation coefficient r?=?0.6492** (n?=?13), a significant positive linear correlation. In addition, available phosphorus content has a remarkable positive linear correlation with organic matter content, r?=?0.9111** (n?=?13), and a remarkable negative linear correlation with pH value, r?=?-0.5945* (n?=?13). In Wushan soil, there is a negative linear correlation between clay content and available phosphorus content, r?=?-0.9289* (n?=?4). Therefore, total phosphorus content, organic matter content and pH value are major impact factors on available phosphorus content in these soils.

The site is located at the Jebel Qalkha area and has archaeological deposits dated to the Early Upper Paleolithic (ca. 38-37 ka) and the Epipaleolithic (ca. 24-15 ka) periods. The excavations at the site have yielded remains of animal prey in addition to lithic tools enabling estimation of paleoenvironments during the late Pleistocene. Despite the poorly preserved condition of animal remains, which is typical of this region, we performed isotope analysis together with identification by morphological analysis and peptide sequencing on animal tooth fragments in addition to the isotope analysis on paleosol organic matters. The in-situ paleosol isotope data points to an environmental shift from a wetter condition in the older period yielding the Qalkhan artifacts (-24-18 ka) to a drier condition in the later period yielding the Mushabian artifacts (-15.5-15.2 ka). The results are consistent with the Pleistocene lake-level shift of Lake Lisan and its pollen data that indicate a sudden shift towards a drier condition since -15-16 ka. This evidence points to a paleoclimatic trend opposite to the one in Mediterranean coast and an even more prominent shift than is recorded in Soreq and Tzavoa cave speleothems during the terminal Pleistocene of the northern Negev. Yet the environmental shift around Tor Hamar was not mirrored in gazelle isotope data. The data show among the greatest isotopic variations in Levant suggesting a change in human hunting strategy that possibly targeted multiple different species of genus Gazella and/or a use of different hunting areas particularly between the Qalkhan and the Mushabian periods.

The present study examined the species diversity and abundance of macrophytes in relation to hydrological parameters in the Alluvial Zone National Park along the Austrian Danube with a main focus on the Lobau, an urban riverine wetland within the city limits of Vienna. A macrophyte regression model was developed based on the output of a 2D hydraulic model for different wetland management options. These management options describe possible rehabilitation measures by re-connecting the riverine wetland with the Danube. Stepwise multiple regressions revealed that the most important predictors of macrophyte diversity and abundance were water velocity at bankfull discharge (maximum water velocity) and size of shallow water areas (<1 m depth) during the growing season. Macrophyte abundance and diversity increased with decreasing water velocity and increasing shallow water area. These parameters integrate information about environmental features such as nutrients, light availability and hydrological disturbance for macrophytes and explained between 65 and 85% of the macrophyte distribution in an analysis. The model results enabled us to predict quantitatively the development and spatial distribution of macrophytes for different management options in this urban riverine wetland. These predictions suggest that partial reconnection could be a compromise solution at the scale of the whole riverine wetland, increasing the availability of suitable aquatic habitats and diversifying the types of existing wetland water bodies to establish potential new habitats for macrophyte species.

Hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry of plant waxes in paired lake catchments	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Studies of plants in modern catchment systems can serve to improve the level of understanding of sedimentary plant wax hydrogen isotope (delta 2H) data by directly investigating the link between local climate conditions, plant source water, leaf water, and plant lipids for individual plant species. Here we present such an application to compare two lake catchments with different basin morphologies in Estonia. We sampled leaf and xylem water, as well as leaf waxes from the seven common plant species in each catchment, and soil water. We then measured the delta 2H values of all waters, and of n-alkanes (delta 2Hn-alk) from the plant waxes, as well as surface lake sediments. We applied a Pe ' clet modified Craig-Gordon leaf water model using local precipitation isotope and climate data to characterize the delta 2H values of the biosynthetic source water pool throughout the entire growth season. The data and model results provide a detailed view of how the input hydro-climatic signals from the precipitation delta 2H values were modified by environmental and plant physiological conditions and ultimately by the biosynthetic isotope fractionation associated with n-alkane production by each plant species. We report both average apparent (epsilon app = -92 +/- 21 %o) and biosynthetic (epsilon bio = -132 +/- 19 %o) hydrogen isotope fractionation factors of all species from the studied catchments. This information serves as a foundation for sedimentary organic geochemistry and paleoclimate studies, which allows for more direct and quantitative links to be made between sedimentary plant wax delta 2H values and the climate signal contained in plant source water.

The impact of climate on the geographical distribution of phytoplankton species in boreal lakes	OECOLOGIA												Here, we use a novel space-by-time approach to study large-scale changes in phytoplankton species distribution in Swedish boreal lakes in response to climate variability. Using phytoplankton samples from 27 lakes, evenly distributed across Sweden, all relatively unimpacted by anthropogenic disturbance and sampled annually between 1996 and 2010, we found significant shifts in the geographical distribution of 18 species. We also found significant changes in the prevalence of 45 species (33 became more common and 12 less common) over the study period. Using species distribution models and phytoplankton samples from 60 lakes sampled at least twice between 1992 and 2010, we evaluated the importance of climate variability and other environmental variables on species distribution. We found that temperature (e.g., extreme events and the duration of the growing season) was the most important predictor for species detections. Many cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, and, to a lesser extent, diatoms and zygnematophytes, showed congruent and positive responses to temperature. In contrast, precipitation explained little variation and was important only for a few taxa (e.g., Staurodesmus spp., Trachelomonas volvocina). At the community level, our results suggest a change in community composition at temperatures over 20 A degrees C and growing seasons longer than 40 days. We conclude that climate is an important driver of the distributional patterns of individual phytoplankton species and may drive changes in community composition in minimally disturbed boreal lakes.					; Johansson, Karin/AGD-4495-2022; Johnson, Richard/P-4991-2014	Trigal, Cristina/0000-0002-4886-3388; Hallstan, Simon/0000-0002-6364-1900; Johnson, Richard/0000-0001-7979-6563													0029-8549	1432-1939				DEC	2013	173	4					1625	1638		10.1007/s00442-013-2708-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2708-6								23817776					WOS:000328210000042

The Floating Forest: Traditional Knowledge and Use of Matupa Vegetation Islands by Riverine Peoples of the Central Amazon	PLOS ONE												Matupas are floating vegetation islands found in floodplain lakes of the central Brazilian Amazon. They form initially from the agglomeration of aquatic vegetation, and through time can accumulate a substrate of organic matter sufficient to grow forest patches of several hectares in area and up to 12 m in height. There is little published information on matupas despite their singular characteristics and importance to local fauna and people. In this study we document the traditional ecological knowledge of riverine populations who live near and interact with matupas. We expected that their knowledge, acquired through long term observations and use in different stages of the matupa life cycle, could help clarify various aspects about the ecology and natural history of these islands that field biologists may not have had the opportunity to observe. Research was carried out in five riverine communities of the Amana Sustainable Development Reserve (Brazil). Semistructured interviews were conducted with 45 inhabitants in order to register local understandings of how matupas are formed, biotic/abiotic factors related to their occurrence, the plants and animals that occur on them, their ecological relevance, and local uses. Local people elucidated several little-known aspects about matupa ecology, especially regarding the importance of seasonal dynamics of high/low water for matupas formation and the relevance of these islands for fish populations. Soil from matupas is especially fertile and is frequently gathered for use in vegetable gardens. In some cases, crops are planted directly onto matupas, representing an incipient agricultural experiment that was previously undocumented in the Amazon. Matupas are also considered a strategic habitat for fishing, mainly for arapaima (Arapaima gigas). The systematic study of traditional ecological knowledge proved to be an important tool for understanding this little-known Amazonian landscape.

This study aimed to evaluate the quality of the Yamchi Dam basin water, which is used for drinking and irrigation consumptions using Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI) model, and to determine the main water pollution sources of this basin. Initially, nine sampling stations were selected in the sensitive locations of the mentioned basin's tributaries, and 12 physico-chemical parameters and 2 biological parameters were measured. The CWQI for drinking consumptions was under 40 at all the stations indicating a poor water quality for drinking consumptions. On the other hand, the CWQI was 62-100 for irrigation at different stations; thus, the water had an excellent to fair quality for irrigation consumptions. Almost in all the stations, the quality of irrigation and drinking water in cold season was better. Besides, for drinking use, total coliform and fecal coliform had the highest frequency of failure, and total coliform had the maximum deviation from the specified objective. For irrigation use, total suspended solids had the highest frequency of failure and deviation from the objective in most of the stations. The pisciculture center, aquaculture center, and the Nir City wastewater discharge were determined as the main pollution sources of the Yamchi Dam basin. Therefore, to improve the water quality in this important surface water resource, urban and industrial wastewater treatment prior to disposal and more stringent environmental legislations are recommended.

Estimating the Biomass of Waterhyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Derived from Simulated Landsat 5 TM	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Waterhyacinth is a free-floating aquatic weed that is considered a nuisance worldwide. Excessive growth of waterhyacinth limits recreational use of water bodies as well as interferes with many ecological processes. Accurate estimates of biomass are useful to assess the effectiveness of control methods to manage this aquatic weed. While large water bodies require significant labor inputs with respect to ground-truth surveys, available technology like remote sensing could be capable of providing temporal and spatial information from a target area at a much reduced cost. Studies were conducted at Lakes Columbus and Aberdeen (Mississippi) during the growing seasons of 2005 and 2006 over established populations of waterhyacinth. The objective was to estimate biomass based on nondestructive methods using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 5 TM simulated data. Biomass was collected monthly using a 0.10m(2) quadrat at 25 randomly-located locations at each site. Morphometric plant parameters were also collected to enhance the use of NDVI for biomass estimation. Reflectance measurements using a hyperspectral sensor were taken every month at each site during biomass collection. These spectral signatures were then transformed into a Landsat 5 TM simulated data set using MatLab (R) software. A positive linear relationship (r(2) = 0.28) was found between measured biomass of waterhyacinth and NDVI values from the simulated dataset. While this relationship appears weak, the addition of morphological parameters such as leaf area index (LAI) and leaf length enhanced the relationship yielding an r(2) = 0.66. Empirically, NDVI saturates at high LAI, which may limit its use to estimate the biomass in very dense vegetation. Further studies using NDVI calculated from narrower spectral bands than those contained in Landsat 5 TM are recommended.																			1939-7291	1939-747X				APR-JUN	2015	8	2					203	211		10.1614/IPSM-D-14-00033.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/IPSM-D-14-00033.1													WOS:000357940900010

Quantifying wetland-aquifer interactions in a humid subtropical climate region: An integrated approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Wetlands are widely recognized as sentinels of global climate change. Long-term monitoring data combined with process-based modeling has the potential to shed light on key processes and how they change over time. This paper reports the development and application of a simple water balance model based on long-term climate, soil, vegetation and hydrological dynamics to quantify groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions at the Norman landfill research site in Oklahoma, USA. Our integrated approach involved model evaluation by means of the following independent measurements: (a) groundwater inflow calculation using stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen (O-16, O-18, H-1, H-2); (b) seepage flux measurements in the wetland hyporheic sediment; and (c) pan evaporation measurements on land and in the wetland. The integrated approach was useful for identifying the dominant hydrological processes at the site, including recharge and subsurface flows. Simulated recharge compared well with estimates obtained using isotope methods from previous studies and allowed us to identify specific annual signatures of this important process during the period of study (1997-2007). Similarly, observations of groundwater inflow and outflow rates to and from the wetland using seepage meters and isotope methods were found to be in good agreement with simulation results. Results indicate that subsurface flow components in the system are seasonal and readily respond to rainfall events. The wetland water balance is dominated by local groundwater inputs and regional groundwater flow contributes little to the overall water balance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The phytoplankton survey combined high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of marker pigments, flow cytometry and epifluorescence and electron microscopy. Availability of similar data from a parallel study on Lake Tanganyika allowed a detailed comparison of phytoplankton composition and ecology in these two lakes. Lake Kivu combines a relatively shallow euphotic layer, usually smaller than As mixed layer, with relatively low nutrient content of the mixolimnion and with unstable thermal stratification of the surface waters. With an annual average chlorophyll a (Chl a) in the mixed layer of 2.2 mg m(-3) and low nutrient levels in the euphotic zone, the lake is clearly oligotrophic. As in other large African Rift lakes, seasonal variations of algal biomass and composition occurred, with substantial interannual variations, mainly related to variabiliy of wind pattern and water column stability. Contrary to earlier reports that described Lake Kivu phytoplankton as dominated by cyanobacteria and green algae, we found that diatoms were the dominant group in the lake, particularly during the dry season (DS) episodes of deep mixing. During the rainy season (RS), the stratified water column, with high light and lower nutrient availability favoured dominance of filamentous, of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and of picocyanobacteria, which represented a substantial fraction of autotrophic biomass. Different phytoplankton functional groups were identified in Lake Kivu, which place it in an intermediate position between the oligotrophic lakes Tanganyika and Malawi and the more eutrophic Lake Victoria. However, the dominant diatoms of Lake Kivu (Urosolenia sp. and the needle-like Nitzschia bacata Hust. and Fragilaria danica Lange-Bert) are known from oligotrophic, P-deficient African lakes, and do not seem to be adequately included in the current functional classifications of freshwater phytoplankton.

In this study, we evaluate the relative roles of local environmental and landscape filters, spatial constraints and seasonality in organization of assemblages of Chironomidae (Diptera), a diverse aquatic insect group with winged adults, in an extremely heterogeneous wetland system, Kis-Balaton, Hungary. As expected, local environmental variables explained a substantial proportion of assemblage variance mainly along sediment structure, macrophyte coverage, and decomposing plant matter gradients. Considering the narrow spatial range of the study area, pure spatial influence was unexpectedly strong, likely because of the dispersal limitation related to tall terrestrial vegetation patches and mass effect related to the uneven distribution and area of certain microhabitats and their species pools. However, landscape-and season-related variability proved to be low or negligible. Taxonomic and functional feeding guild (FFG)-based approaches revealed the same main trends in assemblage data; however, FFGs seemed to track environmental changes more tightly. We argue for the common use of taxonomic and functional-based approaches and advise the improvement of species optima and tolerance spectra databases to expand bioassessment power.					; Specziár, András/N-5656-2019	Specziar, Andras/0000-0001-6341-636X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2017	787	1					353	373		10.1007/s10750-016-2980-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2980-7													WOS:000390139200024

Origin and palaeoenvironmental significance of C25 and C27 n-alk-1-enes in a 25,000-year lake-sedimentary record from equatorial East Africa	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We studied the distribution of long-chain alkenes (n-C-23 to n-C-31) in well-dated sediments from Lake Challa, a deep crater lake near Mt. Kilimanjaro in equatorial East Africa, to reveal signatures of palaeo-environmental and palaeo-climatic changes affecting the production of these compounds during the last 25 kyr. The apolar fractions of organic sediment extracts dated to the last 16 kyr showed an unusual dominance of delta C-13-depleted n-C-25:1 and n-C-27:1 alk-1-enes. These alkenes were not detected in soil and litter from near the shoreline and from the inner rim of the crater, pointing to an autochthonous, aquatic source. Analysis of suspended particulate matter indicated that the n-alk-1-enes are produced in the well-oxygenated upper 30 m of the water column, indicating a phytoplanktonic origin. Sedimenting particles collected monthly from December 2006 to November 2007 showed increased fluxes of n-alk-1-enes following the locally prominent short rain season in November-December. Green algae and/or cyanobacteria were identified as candidate sources of these alkenes. Production of the n-C-25:1 and n-C-27:1 alkenes in Lake Challa was much reduced during the Last Glacial Maximum and early late-glacial period, suggesting a temperature or CO2 effect on habitat suitability. We explored the potential of n-alk-1-ene accumulation rates, and of a derived Alkene Index [n-C-27:1]/([ n-C-25:1] + [ n-C-27:1]), to record longer-term climatic changes. The Alkene Index record of Lake Challa over the past 25 kyr shows clear periodicity with a dominant frequency of similar to 2.3 kyr, potentially indicative of monsoon variability directly or indirectly forced by variation in solar radiation.

J	Istvánovics, V; Honti, M				Istvanovics, Vera; Honti, Mark			Phytoplankton growth in three rivers: The role of meroplankton and the benthic retention hypothesis	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We analyzed long-term (5-8 yr) hourly time series of chlorophyll (Chl) converted from fluorescence measurements in relation to discharge and light in three medium-to large-size rivers, where planktonic diatoms dominated during the growing season. Overall, there was an inverse relationship between discharge and Chl. At fine temporal scales, flow pulses were typically accompanied by an increase in diatom Chl. In contrast, chlorophytes were usually diluted. The increase in diatoms was likely due to resuspension of meroplanktonic species from the bottom. The benthic retention hypothesis proposes that rapidly sedimenting diatoms take advantage of a prolonged benthic residence provided that the enhanced retention is sufficient to compensate for slower light-supported growth at the bottom relative to water. This hypothesis was tested with simple growth models. Although the rivers were highly turbid and did not support net growth when flow exceeded a rather low threshold, benthic retention might have favored low-light-adapted algae during more than half of the period when net growth was possible. Among the physical factors, the rate of resuspension might be the critical factor that determines the ultimate success of a meroplanktonic life cycle strategy. The three rivers of this study rarely supported persistent planktonic populations. We propose that self-sustaining populations of riverine algae are primarily based on meroplanktonic diatom species, whereas truly planktonic populations, mostly chlorophytes, depend on periodic inoculations from out-of-channel sources.					; Honti, Mark/A-8410-2014	Istvanovics, Vera/0000-0003-2433-1528; 													0024-3590					JUL	2011	56	4					1439	1452		10.4319/lo.2011.56.4.1439	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.4.1439													WOS:000294603400021

Planctomycetes, which are less-abundant bacteria in freshwater ecosystems, appeared to be structured in the same way as the entire bacterial community in these ecosystems. They were more diversified and displayed fewer temporal variations in the hypolimnia than in the epilimnia. Like the more-abundant bacterial groups in aquatic systems, Planctomycetes communities seem to be composed of a very small number of abundant and widespread operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and a large number of OTUs that are present at low abundance. This indicates that the concept of "abundant or core" and "rare" bacterial phylotypes could also be applied to less-abundant freshwater bacterial phyla. The richness and diversity of Planctomycetes were mainly driven by pH and were similar in both of the lakes studied, whereas the composition of the Planctomycetes community seemed to be determined by a combination of factors including temperature, pH, and nutrients. The relative abundances of the dominant OTUs varied over time and were differently associated with abiotic factors. Our findings demonstrate that less-abundant bacterial phyla, such as Planctomycetes, can display strong spatial and seasonal variations linked to environmental conditions and suggest that their functional role in the lakes studied might be attributable mainly to a small number of phylotypes and vary over space and time in the water column.					; Pollet, Thomas/AAZ-2141-2021	Humbert, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-1519-5651; Pollet, Thomas/0000-0002-3427-7695; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				JUL	2011	77	14					4811	4821		10.1128/AEM.02697-10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02697-10								21602381					WOS:000292510400013

It is a comparative study which outlines the changing state of the area based on old maps, other archival materials, remote sensing data from the years 1900 to 2021, and our own fieldwork performed since 2005. The indirect cause of this transformation is identified herein as climate warming which has produced a progressive degradation of the cryosphere and triggered three key forces behind the said transformation: glacial recession in the 20th century, shortening of the sea-ice season, permafrost thawing in the 21st century. From the year 1900 to the 1920s the coastal landscape of the study area consisted of a bay with beaches between a mountain range in the west and a tidewater glacier tongue protruding into the sea in the northeast. The tongue subsequently melted and the bay became transformed into a coastal plain, with the resulting lake becoming separated from the sea by a gravel-sand bar by 1936. Afterwards, both the plain and lake dwindled in size due to the decline of the bar found to the west. This process continued until the lake became divided into two parts in the 1980s; one of these then disappeared between 2006 and 2010, and the second one by 2021. Hence, the land in question, with the coastal plain partly glaciated and surrounding the bay, then unglaciated and surrounding the lake, became over time replaced by the sea. Today, the process of abrasion acting near the sea is destroying the remaining beaches and cutting down the steep slopes of area mountains and ice-cored moraines.					; Ostafin, Krzysztof/L-9471-2017	Kruse, Frigga/0000-0003-1778-1010; Ostafin, Krzysztof/0000-0002-4426-3211; Maciejowski, Wojciech/0000-0001-7994-8985; 													1085-3278	1099-145X				OCT	2023	34	16					4823	4832		10.1002/ldr.4765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4765		SEP 2023											WOS:001066203400001

The two omnivores, Colossoma macropomum and Mylossoma duriventre, exhibited trends consistent with their life cycles in 2004 and 2006: high values during the hydrologic seasons of high water, receding water, and low water, with a drop following reproduction following the onset of rising water. However during the drought year of 2005 the condition factor was much lower than normal during receding and low water seasons, probably as a result of an abnormal reduction in resource availability in a reduced habitat. The two piscivorous piranhas, Serrasalmus spilopleura and S. elongatus, maintained relatively stable values of condition factor over the hydrologic cycles of all three years, with no apparent effect of the drought, probably because the reduction in habitat is counterbalanced by the resulting increase in relative prey density. We suggest that if predictions of increasing drought in the Amazon are correct, predatory species may benefit, at least in the short run, while omnivores may be negatively affected.

Through-ice AUV deployment: Operational and technical experience from two seasons of Arctic fieldwork	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Detailed sea ice draft mapping was recently accomplished in the Beaufort Sea, north of Alaska, in 2007 and in the Lincoln Sea, north of Canada's Ellesmere Island, in 2008 using a small (3 m long, 20 cm diameter), man-handleable Gavia AUV incorporating an inertial navigation system and a 500 kHz phase-measuring swath sonar. The topography of specific ice features was mapped across 80 m-wide swaths by performing repeated runs in the vicinity of access holes drilled in the sea ice. The paper discusses the technical and operational developments undertaken to successfully accomplish the missions, including test deployments in a frozen Canadian lake prior to each Arctic deployment. Example data are shown and accuracy issues discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a morphologically distinctive species which forms a genetically well-defined cluster. In contrast, some species within Aphanizomenon and Anabaena are morphologically not clearly assignable to either genera and both genera are polyphyletic. In the Cylindrospermopsis cluster CYN producing and non-producing strains co-occur, but it is not known if CYN producing and non-producing strains are closely related in Anabaena and Aphanizomenon. Here we attempt to disentangle the phylogenetic relationships of four taxa of the genera Anabaena and Aphanizomenon, some of which are known as CYN producers. We have sequenced and phylogenetically analysed partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene, cpcBA-IGS and rpoC1 from 31 cyanobacteria isolates of the genera Aphanizomenon and Anabaena and have documented morphotypic characteristics of new and recently isolated strains. Our results do not corroborate the separation of Aph. gracile and Aph. flos-aquae into separate species. In contrast, they support the distinction of Ana. bergii and Aph. ovalisporum into distinct taxa. Further, Ana. bergii is most likely not a CYN producing species.					; Dadheech, Pawan/B-5580-2008; Quesada, Antonio/L-2430-2013	Stuken, Anke/0000-0002-7553-9524; Quesada, Antonio/0000-0002-8913-5993													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY	2009	31	5					465	480		10.1093/plankt/fbp011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbp011													WOS:000265098100001

During this climatic transition, the Masoko catchment vegetation changed from being intolerant to a long/severe dry season to being tolerant, while the inferred lake-dynamics indicates strengthened seasonal fluctuations and/or lower levels than before. Comparison of the Masoko record with other regional palaeoclimatic data shows that evidence of this climatic transition is widespread in tropical Africa. The proposed failure of the African Monsoon during the Younger Dryas, associated with a southward position/migration of the meteorological equator in East Africa, was followed by an abrupt and lasting resumption of monsoon activity, and more pronounced migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the African continent. Such a reorganisation of the atmospheric circulation, equally observed across the whole tropical region (South America, East and West Asia, and Africa), could have been a strong amplifier of northern high latitude changes in temperature and precipitation across this major climatic transition.

J	Petry, P; Bayley, PB; Markle, DF				Petry, P; Bayley, PB; Markle, DF			Relationships between fish assemblages, macrophytes and environmental gradients in the Amazon River floodplain	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												During the flood season of 1992-1993, 139 species of fishes were collected from a floodplain Like system in the central Amazon Basin. Fish species distribution was examined relative to abiotic variables in seven vegetation strata on Marchantaria Island, Solimoes River. Both environmental variables and species distributions were influenced by a river channel to floodplain-interior gradient. Species diversity was significantly higher ill vegetated areas than in unvegetated areas, with deeper water Paspalum repens stands harbouring the highest diversity. As a result, species richness and catches were positively related to habitat complexity, while catch was also negatively related to dissolved oxygen (DO) and water depth. Low DO and shallow waters appeared to act as a refuge from predation. Fish assemblages were related to water chemistry, but species richness was not. Canonical correspondence analysis provided evidence that floodplain fish assemblages formed by the 76 most common species were influenced by physical variables, macrophyte coverage and habitat complexity, which jointly accounted for 67% of the variance of fish species assemblages. Omnivores showed no pattern relative to the river channel to floodplain-interior gradient while detritivores were more likely to be found at interior floodplain sites and piscivores closer to the river. Piscivores could he further separated into three groups, one with seven species associated with tree-floating macrophytes in deep water, a second with five species found in shallow waters with rooted grasses and a third with six open water orientated species. The results suggest that fish assemblages in the Amazon floodplain are not random associations of species. (C) 2003 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

Subsidence drives habitat loss in a large permafrost delta, Mackenzie River outlet to the Beaufort Sea, western Arctic	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Mackenzie Delta is an extensive river-mouth depocentre, the second largest delta on the Arctic Ocean, and lies in the zone of continuous permafrost. We report the first measurements of natural consolidation subsidence in a highlatitude delta with ice-bonded sediments. Several years of episodic GPS records on a network of 15 stable monuments throughout the central and outer delta reveal downward motion between 1.5 ?? 0.7 and 5.3 ?? 1.1 mm/year relative to a nearby monument on bedrock. Additional shallow subsidence results from loss of near-surface excess ice with deeper seasonal thaw in a warming climate. Isostatic adjustment is a third component of subsidence, captured in the NAD83v70VG crustal velocity model. Sedimentation rates over much of the outer delta are less than the rate of subsidence combined with rising sea level. Scenarios for future inundation are evaluated using interpolated IPCC AR5 projections, NAD83v70VG, and a LiDAR DEM with realistic consolidation, thaw subsidence, and sedimentation rates, on time scales of 40 and 90 years. These reveal increases in area flooded at mean water level from 33% in 2010 to 65% or as much as 85% in 2100, depending on the emissions scenario, driving delta-front retreat and removing a large proportion of avian nesting habitat. The three components of subsidence together increase the relative sea-level rise by a factor of two to eight, depending on the scenario. Consolidation subsidence may also contribute to rising low-flow water levels in the central delta, increasing river-lake connectivity, with negative impacts on aquatic biodiversity and productivity.

J	Winsemann, J; Asprion, U; Meyer, T; Schramm, C				Winsemann, Jutta; Asprion, Ulrich; Meyer, Thomas; Schramm, Christoph			Facies characteristics of Middle Pleistocene (Saalian) ice-margin subaqueous fan and delta deposits, glacial Lake Leine, NW Germany	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The blocking of major river valleys in the Lemebergland area by the Early Saalian Scandinavian ice sheet led to the formation of a large glacial lake, referred to as "glacial Lake Leine", where most of the sediment was deposited by meltwater. At the initial stage, the level of glacial Lake Leine was approx. 110 in a.s.l. The lake level then rose by as much as 100 in to a highstand of approx. 200 in a.s.l. Two genetically distinct ice-margin depositional systems are described that formed on the northern margin of glacial Lake Leine in front of the retreating Scandinavian ice sheet. The Bornhausen delta is up to 15 in thick and characterized by a large-scale tangential geometry with dip angles from 10 degrees-28 degrees, reflecting high-angle foreset deposition on a steep delta slope. Foreset beds consist of massive clast-supported gravel and pebbly sand, alternating with planar-parallel stratified pebbly sand, deposited from cohesionless debris flows, sandy debris flows and high-density turbidity flows. The finer-grained sandy material moved further downslope where it was deposited from low-density turbidity currents to form massive or ripple-cross-laminated sand in the toeset area. The Freden ice-margin depositional system shows a more complex architecture, characterized by two laterally stacked sediment bodies. The lower part of the section records deposition on a subaqueous ice-contact fan. The upper pail of the Freden section is interpreted to represent delta-slope deposits. Beds display low- to high-angle bedding (3 degrees-30 degrees) and consist of planar and trough cross-stratified pebbly sand and climbing-ripple cross-laminated sand. The supply of meltwater-transported sediment to the delta slope was from steady seasonal flows. During higher energy conditions, 2-D and 3-D dunes formed, migrating downslope and passing into ripples. During lower-energy flow conditions thick climbing-ripple cross-laminated sand beds accumulated also on higher parts of the delta slope. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Basin-Scale Control on the Phytoplankton Biomass in Lake Victoria, Africa	PLOS ONE												The relative bio-optical variability within Lake Victoria was analyzed through the spatio-temporal decomposition of a 19972004 dataset of remotely-sensed reflectance ratios in the visible spectral range. Results show a regular seasonal pattern with a phase shift (around 2 months) between the south and north parts of the lake. Interannual trends suggested a teleconnection between the lake dynamics and El-Nino phenomena. Both seasonal and interannual patterns were associated to conditions of light limitation for phytoplankton growth and basin-scale hydrodynamics on phytoplankton access to light. Phytoplankton blooms developed during the periods of lake surface warming and water column stability. The temporal shift apparent in the bio-optical seasonal cycles was related to the differential cooling of the lake surface by southeastern monsoon winds. North-south differences in the exposure to trade winds are supported by the orography of the Eastern Great Rift Valley. The result is that surface layer warming begins in the northern part of the lake while the formation of cool and dense water continues in the southern part. The resulting buoyancy field is sufficient to induce a lake-wide convective circulation and the tilting of the isotherms along the north-south axis. Once surface warming spreads over the whole lake, the phytoplankton bloom dynamics are subjected to the internal seiche derived from the relaxation of thermocline tilting. In 1997-98, El-Nino phenomenon weakened the monsoon wind flow which led to an increase in water column stability and a higher phytoplankton optical signal throughout the lake. This suggests that phytoplankton response to expected climate scenarios will be opposite to that proposed for nutrient-limited great lakes. The present analysis of remotely-sensed bio-optical properties in combination with environmental data provides a novel basin-scale framework for research and management strategies in Lake Victoria.

By tracking these two aspects in recently emerged adults of 10 species of an odonate community in a number of lakes, we investigated whether (a) body size in both sexes decreased as the flight season progressed and whether this led to seasonal changes in sexual size dimorphism (SSD); (b) SSD patterns were related to mating systems; (c) biases in sex ratio could be explained by mortality rates associated with the largest sex (e. g. in species with male-biased SSD, a female-biased sex ratio; in species with female-biased SSD, a male-biased sex ratio). Our results indicated that adults in most species, but not all, tend to reach a smaller body size as the season progressed. However, the opposite pattern was found in a few species. Predictions about the relation between SSD and mating systems were confirmed: a female-biased SSD in nonterritorial species and monomorphism for territorial species. However, predictions of biases in sex ratio according to SSD were not met in all species. Interestingly, changes in body size and SSD along the season were lake-specific in two species in which these patterns could be examined. These results, although partially supportive of environmental and sexual selection patterns acting on size and sex ratio as documented in other odonate species, indicate that we are still far from understanding seasonal constrains in these animals.

The sedimentological study, including sand-grain morphology and micromorphology analyses, reveals the presence at Krosinko of a meandering river and of a braided river during the Eemian (MIS 5e) and Upper Pleniweichselian (MIS 2), respectively. The fluvial regime changed over time, from low-energy, through highenergy, to low-energy, as documented by the differently formed sedimentary units A-D (vertical sedimentary succession from base to top: sandy silt, sand, gravelly sand, and sand). Sedimentary unit A and the lower part of unit B were accumulated in the Eemian interglacial (MIS 5e) by the low-energy meandering river. The highenergy fluvial environment during the Weichselian is associated with long, intense sediment transport, organic remains, and flints, as confirmed by taphonomic studies on conifer cones (Picea cf. abies) and wood remains (Juniperus). The river operated under distinct environmental conditions. First, during the accumulation of the upper part of unit B and unit C, there was a strong influence of freezing and aeolian weathering, which weakened significantly over time (unit D). This in turn indicates a change in climate from periglacial (upper part of unit B and unit C), when we also document the presence of permafrost in the subsurface or relatively deep seasonal frost, to temperate (unit D). With warming in the Holocene (MIS 1), an oxbow lake developed in Krosinko, the presence of which is recorded by peat.

We performed a decomposition experiment in Poyang Lake Wetland, to determine how water table affected the degradation of cellulose and lignin. After 60days of decomposition at a site with a relatively highly water table, 46.19% of initial cellulose and 41.95% of initial lignin remained. Decay rates of both cellulose and lignin increased as the depth of the water table increased. Principle component analysis showed that the decay rates of cellulose and lignin increased with increasing soil pH, but decreased with increasing contents of clay and fungi: bacteria ratio. The path model accounted for 66% and 79% of the variation in cellulose and lignin decay rates, respectively, and considered the effects of interactions between the water table and related factors. The cellulose decay rate was affected by the water table with a direct coefficient of 0.47, and an indirect coefficient of 0.65, but the lignin decay rate was indirectly affected by water table (coefficient, 1.25) and directly affected by soil property (coefficient, 0.67). Thus, the water table affected the decomposition of cellulose and lignin via different mechanisms.

Normally, the lake is mesosaline (up to 50 ppt) and its phytoplankton is dominated by few species of cyanobacteria, in particular Arthrospira fusiformis, which is the main food resource of Lesser Flamingos. Our study recovered a unique phytoplankton species composition characterized by a high diversity of monadoid and coccoid green algae. Out of 77 clones detected, 52 belonged to Chlorophyta. Many of the chlorophytes were transported from the catchment area into the lake through small seasonal rivers and an outflow of the Nakuru town sewage treatment plant.

A bioenergetics-based index of habitat suitability: Spatial dynamics of foraging constraints and food limitation for a rare estuarine fish	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												ObjectivesHabitat suitability models can guide restoration efforts in freshwater and estuarine ecosystems by synthesizing important habitat attributes in a single index. Several important elements of the foraging arena of Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus, a small, zooplanktivorous fish, were quantified using a model that combined bioenergetics with physical habitat attributes. We applied the model to evaluate spatiotemporal variation in the suitability of Delta Smelt foraging habitat as indicated by growth potential.MethodsBioenergetics-based estimates of daily potential growth, given constraints on daily foraging due to temperature, turbidity, day length, and prey availability, were compared to reference growth, estimated separately from length-at-age data. We defined suitable foraging arenas for Delta Smelt as times and places when potential growth equaled or exceeded reference growth.ResultAmong six contiguous regions of the upper San Francisco Estuary, temperature was consistently lowest and turbidity highest in the most seaward locations. As a result, predicted growth rates were greater there compared to landward, upstream regions that were warmer and less turbid.ConclusionSimulated habitat augmentation of prey and turbidity revealed that the effects of potential restoration actions could vary regionally as the factors limiting Delta Smelt foraging varied along longitudinal and seasonal gradients. Models of the spatiotemporal variation in Delta Smelt habitat may be substantially improved by directed laboratory studies; however, this research provided a data-driven example of how dynamic estuarine habitat attributes interact to influence the suitability of foraging arenas experienced by a pelagic fish. A model of foraging habitat suitability was developed to synthesize measurements of habitat, assess spatiotemporal variation, and provide a quantitative tool to guide restoration for the recovery of a rare fish.Impact statement						Nobriga, Matthew/0000-0002-6758-9257													0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2023	152	5					650	671		10.1002/tafs.10427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10427		SEP 2023											WOS:001108597000001

DETECTING AND MODELING CHANGES IN A TIME SERIES OF PROPORTIONS	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS												We propose a framework to detect and model shifts in a time series of continuous proportions, that is, a vector of proportions measuring the parts of a whole. By reparameterizing the shape of a Dirichlet distribution, we can model the location and scale separately through generalized linear models. A hidden Markov model allows the coefficients of the generalized linear models to change, thus allowing for the time series to undergo multiple regimes. This framework allows a practitioner to adequately model seasonality, trends, or include covariate information as well as detect change points. The model's behavior is studied via simulation and through the analysis of lake phytoplankton data from 1992 through 2012. Our analyses demonstrate that the model can be effective in detecting and modeling changes in a time series of proportions. Pertaining to the phytoplankton data, the overall biomass has grown with some changes to the community level dynamics occurring circa 2000. Specifically, the proportion of cyanobacteria appears to have increased to the detriment of diatoms.																			1932-6157	1941-7330				MAR	2022	16	1					477	494		10.1214/21-AOAS1509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/21-AOAS1509													WOS:000774613000022
J	Liu, XM; Xu, M; Zhou, HL				Liu, Xiaoming; Xu, Mei; Zhou, Huiling			Analyzing the Spatio-Temporal Distribution and Network Structure of Ecotourism Flow in Zhangjiajie	SUSTAINABILITY												Tourism flow is an important monitoring indicator for the industrial operation of ecotourism destinations, crucial in its planning, development, and marketing. Based on the travel journal data of popular tourism websites, this paper analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution, network structure, and the coupling characteristics between ecotourism flow and traffic accessibility in Zhangjiajie using standard deviation ellipse, social network analysis, kernel density estimation, and a spatial coupling model. The main results are as follows: (1) In terms of time distribution, the ecotourism flow in Zhangjiajie is mainly short-term tourism, with significant seasonal differences. (2) In terms of spatial structure, the ecotourism flow in Zhangjiajie presents a polygonal distribution of "core-edge", forming a dense distribution area of Wulingyuan-Tianmen Mountain-Huanglongdong ecotourism flow. (3) In terms of spatial and temporal distribution, the connection intensity between the core area of ecotourism flow in Zhangjiajie and other scenic spots increases as the tourism length of stay increases. However, the radiation scope is mainly in the surrounding ecotourism scenic spots. (4) The coupling degree of ecotourism flow and traffic accessibility in Zhangjiajie is high, but the coupling coordination degree remains low on the whole. In addition, there is a serious mismatch between ecotourism flow and traffic accessibility in Zhangjiajie.

In this study, tissue distribution and seasonal dynamics of MC-RR and -LR were investigated in various organs of a freshwater snail (Sinotaia histrica) in a temperate eutrophic lake, Lake Suwa, Japan. Accumulation of microcystins in some fish was also investigated. There was marked temporal variation in the MC content of various organs of the snail. The digestive tract had the highest MC content (mean 9.03 mu g g(-1) DW and range 3.74-23.2 mu g g(-1) DW), followed by the gonad (mean 6.90 mu g g(-1) DW and range 0.07-22.7 mu g g(-1) DW) and hepatopancreas (mean 5.38 mu g g(-1) DW and range 1.08-8.79 mu g g- 1 DW), whereas the foot had the least (mean 2.48 mu g g(-1) DW and range 0.04-4.45 mu g g(-1) DW). The disappearance of MC-LR in the hepatopancreas indicated that S histrica is able to depurate MC-LR efficiently. MC-RR was detected in the muscle of three species of fish, with the highest content in Carassius auratus (79.4 mu g kg(-1) BW). Because of substantial MC accumulation in these edible aquatic animals in Lake Suwa, it is recommended that regular monitoring of MCs should be undertaken in both cyanobacteria and aquatic animals.

Tana (Ethiopia) Threatened by Extinction: Implications for Conservation Management	WATER												The endemic Labeobarbus species in Lake Tana are severely affected by anthropogenic pressures. The implementation of fisheries management is, therefore, vital for their sustainable exploitation. This study aimed at investigating the catch distribution and size at 50% maturity (FL50%) of the Labeobarbus species. Samples were collected monthly from May 2016 to April 2017 at four sites. The relative abundance, catch per unit effort (CPUE), and size distribution of these species was computed, and logistic regression was used to calculate FL50%. Of the 15 species observed, five species constituted 88% of the total catch. The monthly catch of the Labeobarbus spp. declined by more than 85% since 1993 and by 76% since 2001. Moreover, the CPUE of Labeobarbus has markedly decreased from 63 kg/trip in 1991-1993 to 2 kg/trip in 2016-2017. Additionally, large size specimens (>= 30 cm fork length) were rarely recorded, and FL50% of the dominant species decreased. This suggests that the unique species flock may be threatened by extinction. Given the size distribution of the species, the current social context, and the need for a continuous supply of fish for low-income communities, a mesh-size limitation represents a more sustainable and acceptable management measure than a closed season. This paper illustrates the tension between sustainable development goal (SDGs) 1-No Poverty, 2-Zero Hunger, and 8-Decent Work and Economic Growth in Bahir Dar City on the one hand, and SDG's 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities, 12-Responsible Consumption and Production, and 14-Life Below Water on the other hand. A key for the local, sustainable development of the fisheries is to find a balance between the fishing activities and the carrying capacity of the Lake Tana. Overfishing and illegal fishing are some of the major threats in this respect.

Kendall's tau-b demonstrated that FC levels were significantly and positively correlated with the amount of residential area within a drainage catchment generating the runoff, and that FC levels were location dependent. Climatic variables of temperature and antecedent dry period length were significantly and positively correlated with FC levels at both the sampling location level and across the region overall. Precipitation and flowrates were negatively correlated with FC levels. Fourier analysis showed that monthly FC levels shared the same 12 month cycle (peaking in July) as precipitation and temperature. MLR modelling was applied by aggregating the LogFC data by order of magnitude. The MLR model shows that the data are subject to different influences depending on the season and as well, the month of the year. The land use and climate analyses suggest that future climate change impact studies attempted on nearshore bacterial water quality should be conducted at the urban catchment scale.

The study of lake waters was undertaken to explain which physicochemical parameters of the environment have the greatest influence on the level of aldehydes, which of the aldehydes are most often met in surface water and in what concentrations. We observed that formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propanal, glyoxal, methylglyoxal and acetone were commonly present in surface water samples, while semi-volatile and poorly soluble aldehydes such as nonanal and decanal were observed seasonally. The contents of total aldehydes varied in a wide range, from 55 to 670 mu g/l, and the concentration of total organic carbon varied significantly from 3 to 18 mg /l, but there was no evident correlation between them in all of samples. The total content of aldehydes did not depend on the meteorological parameters such as air temperature, UV radiation and ozone concentration; however, it was noted that the level of carbonyl concentration is related to the period of intense precipitation: in the period of very low precipitations, the highest contents of total aldehydes were determined in all of the water samples, and in the periods of intense precipitations, the content of total aldehydes was drastically smaller.					; Dabrowska, Agata/AAA-3036-2019; Nawrocki, Jacek/A-6239-2014	Szelag-Wasielewska, Elzbieta/0000-0002-7542-6490; Nawrocki, Jacek/0000-0002-3956-2735; Dabrowska, Agata/0000-0002-9121-4586; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2014	186	7					4569	4580		10.1007/s10661-014-3720-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3720-y								24671617					WOS:000337030000048

Conversion of open lands to short-rotation woody biomass crops: site variability affects nitrogen cycling and N2O fluxes in the US Northern Lake States	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY												Short-rotation woody biomass crops (SRWC) have been proposed as a major feedstock source for bioenergy generation in the Northeastern US. To quantify the environmental effects and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of crops including SRWC, investigators need spatially explicit data which encompass entire plantation cycles. A knowledge gap exists for the establishment period which makes current GHG calculations incomplete. In this study, we investigated the effects of converting pasture and hayfields to willow (Salix spp.) and hybrid-poplar (Populus spp.) SRWC plantations on soil nitrogen (N) cycling, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and nitrate (NO3-) leaching at six sites of varying soil and climate conditions across northern Michigan and Wisconsin, following these plantations from pre conversion through their first 2 years. All six sites responded to establishment with increased N2O emissions, available inorganic N, and, where it was measured, NO3- leaching; however, the magnitude of these impacts varied dramatically among sites. Soil NO3- levels varied threefold among sites, with peak extractable NO3- concentrations ranging from 15 to 49 g N kg(-1) soil. Leaching losses were significant and persisted through the second year, with 44-112 kg N ha(-1) leached in SRWC plots. N2O emissions in the first growing season varied 30-fold among sites, from 0.5 to 17.0 Mg-CO(2)eq ha(-1) (carbon dioxide equivalents). N2O emissions over 2 years resulted in N2O emissions due to plantation establishment that ranged from 0.60 to 22.14 Mg-CO(2)eq ha(-1) above baseline control levels across sites. The large N losses we document herein demonstrate the importance of including direct effects of land conversion in life-cycle analysis (LCA) studies of SRWC GHG balance. Our results also demonstrate the need for better estimation of spatial variability of N cycling processes to quantify the full environmental impacts of SRWC plantations.

A review of investigations on diatoms (Bacillariophyta) in Turkish inland waters	NOVA HEDWIGIA												A compilation/discussion of data published on diatoms in aquatic systems from Turkey is provided based on data ordered according to type of study, type of water body, and river basins within the conterminous Turkish territory. The majority of phycological studies in Turkey focus on phytoplankton seasonal changes in lakes and reservoirs located in lowlands, while only a few studies related to high mountain lakes and lotic systems have been published. Palaeolimnological work is also restricted to some basins, while others have been completely neglected from this perspective. Several studies performed during last decade focus on the application of diatoms to water quality monitoring, a topic that is rapidly gaining popularity among local scientists. The main shortcoming in all the studies is the pervasive use of publications based on European material as identification sources, which may have resulted in force-fitting of Turkish taxa into European-based concepts, thus giving a skewed impression of diversity and an imprecise estimation of the ecological requirements of the different taxa. Additionally, because of current research practices, chiefly by native researchers, the vast majority of publications only contain reports of the most common taxa. Even for these common diatoms, there is a severe lack of supporting information in the form of descriptions, argumentation or illustrations, which makes the elaboration of a catalogue a difficult if not impossible task. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a background for further investigations; it includes an identification of neglected geographical and research areas.

Dry deposition fluxes and deposition velocities of seven trace metal species at five sites in central Taiwan - a summary of surrogate surface measurements and a comparison with model estimations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Daily air concentrations and dry deposition fluxes of seven metal species were monitored at five sites in central Taiwan for five or six days every month from September 2009 to August 2010. Annual average concentrations at the five sites were in the range of 2.8 to 3.6 ng m(-3) for As, 25 to 82 ng m(-3) for Mn, 1900 to 2800 ng m(-3) for Fe, 69 to 109 ng m(-3) for Zn, 18 to 33 ng m(-3) for Cr, 60 to 110 ng m(-3) for Cu, and 25 to 40 ng m(-3) for Pb. Annual average dry deposition fluxes were on the order of 3, 20, 400, 50, 25, 50, and 50 mu g m(-2) day(-1) for As, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cr, Cu, and Pb, respectively. Annual average dry deposition velocities (V-d) for the seven metal species ranged from 0.18 to 2.22 cm s(-1) at these locations. Small seasonal and geographical variations, e.g. from a few percent to a factor of 2 for different species and/or at different locations, were found in the measured concentrations, fluxes, and V(d)s. The measured fluxes and air concentrations had moderate to good correlations for several of the species at several of the sites (e.g. Fe, Zn, and Mn at most of the sites), but had either weak or no correlations for the other species or at the other sites (e.g. As at Sites I and III, Zn and Cr at Site IV, and Cu at most of the sites). The latter cases were believed to have large uncertainties in the flux measurements using surrogate surfaces. Sensitivity tests were conducted for particle V(d)s using a size-segregated particle dry deposition model, assuming various combinations of three lognormal size distributions representing fine particles (PM2.5), coarse particles (PM2.5-10), and super-sized particles (PM10+), respectively. It was found that the measured dry deposition fluxes can be reproduced reasonably well using the size-segregated particle dry deposition model if the mass fractions of the metal species in PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM10+ were known. Significant correlations between the modeled and the measured daily fluxes were found for those cases that were believed to have small uncertainties in the flux measurements.

Bacterial community structure in three rivers located in Shanghai city was studied over a 1-year period using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Subsurface samples were collected every 2 months from two study sites in each river. Water was characterized when biological samples were collected by measuring temperature, pH, chloride ion, total dissolved solids (TDS), total N and total P. complex DGGE band patterns indicated high bacterial diversity in the rivers. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that variation of the bacterial communities was higher between rivers than it was between samples from the same river. When evaluated using principal component analysis, samples collected during warmer months from any particular river tended to group together while cold-season samples generally clustered, suggesting significant seasonal impacts. Redundancy analysis was used to identify relationships between environmental factors and bacterial community composition in each individual river. Temperature, TDS, pH, TP and salt concentration were all identified as being related to bacterial community structure, with temperature being the most influential parameter in all three rivers. Our results indicated that bacterial community composition was different in the three different rivers. Even though the rivers were located in heavily disturbed urban ecosystems, temperature was the major driver of bacterial community composition, just as it is in natural systems.					; Zhang, Meiling/AEQ-4299-2022	Chen, Liqiao/0000-0003-0138-7828; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2012	74	1					113	120		10.1007/s00027-011-0201-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0201-z													WOS:000298750900009

Phragmites management in high water: cutting plants under water limits biomass production, carbohydrate storage, and rhizome viability	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Invasion of Phragmites australis (common reed) in wetlands throughout North America, and particularly the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin, poses significant ecological problems. The extended period of low Great Lakes water levels from 2000 to 2013 created conditions for large expansions of Phragmites in the Great Lakes coastal zone. The following extended period of high water in the Great Lakes during late 2010's, culminating in record high lake levels in 2020 allowed managers to take advantage of high water by using a cut-to-drown management strategy (i.e., cutting plants below the water surface to stop the flow of atmospheric gases) to control Phragmites populations. To examine the efficacy of a cut-to-drown control strategy, we conducted a controlled-greenhouse study that tested the effect of submergence and timing of cutting (early or late in growing season) on Phragmites growth and viability post treatment. To evaluate Phragmites growth and viability, we measured belowground biomass, rhizome non-structural carbohydrate content (NSC), and rhizome viability following a cut-to-drown treatment. Applying a cut-to-drown treatment reduced average belowground biomass production up to 99%, limited rhizome NSC content up to 83%, and inhibited rhizome viability, regardless of timing of cutting treatments. These results suggest that under high-water conditions, utilizing a cut-to-drown strategy has potential for being a useful control mechanism for Phragmites. However, further research is needed to determine to what extent these results will lead to sustained reductions in growth and viability under field conditions, where rhizome belowground biomass and storage capacity are much larger.

Which environmental variables better explain changes in anuran community composition? A case study in the Restinga of Mata de Sao Joao, Bahia, Brazil	HERPETOLOGICA												Most studies of amphibian communities are restricted to aquatic environments, which precludes sound descriptions of changes in composition throughout entire habitats. Moreover, few works focus on the environmental processes that shape the composition of these communities, particularly in tropical ecosystems. In this study, we investigated which environmental variables were able to predict the main changes in anuran community composition in a shrub-to-forest Restinga on the northeastern coastline of Bahia State, Brazil. In 30 plots (60 X 25 in) along a continuous Restinga area, we determined, over two consecutive rainy seasons, the abundances of anuran species and 20 primary environmental variables. We represented the main environmental gradients of the Restinga rising the first axes derived from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the matrix of environmental variables. We represented the main changes in community composition using a synthetic axis built by applying the nonmetric multidimensional scaling technique (NMS) on the matrix of species abundances. We then evaluated, using a multiple linear regression test, which environmental gradients, if any, were able to explain changes in community composition. We recorded 737 anurans, belonging to 8 families, 17 genera, and 30 species. Five orthogonal environmental gradients were extracted, representing ca. 80% of the variance of the matrix of environmental variables; the first PC represented the covariation among the amount of leaves in the stratum from 6 to 10 in high, percentage of leaf litter, percentage of terrestrial bromeliads with direct sunlight, number of terrestrial bromeliads, and soil moisture. The NMS axis explained 50% of the variance of the abundance matrix and ordered the plots through the sequence (I) beach zone, (2) arboreal vegetation with temporary ponds and/or permanent lakes, (3) arboreal vegetation with rivers or streams, and (4) arboreal vegetation without bodies of water. Only PC1, which represented a shrub-to-forest gradient, was significantly related to the NMS axis. The change on plant communities, allied to soil moisture and type of water body, was the most important environmental factor acting on the structure of the anuran community herein studied.

However, the unique combination of non-vegetational characteristics of a waterbody, i.e. its site identity, can be an influential factor in itself, shaping the measured parameters irrespective of the presence or absence of certain macrophyte species. In this situation, the relative strengths of all factors can be determined best in a study that explicitly accounts for differences in the identity of the waterbodies. Several functional macrophyte groups are known to provide a potent microinvertebrate refuge or permanent habitat. The objective of this study was to detect patterns in the zooplankton assemblages associated with different extensive habitats of macrophyte species and to relate these patterns to three major factors: the microhabitat, the pond identity and the seasonality in the warmer months of the year. Five ponds located in the Woluwe catchment of the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium) were studied monthly for macrophyte and zooplankton characteristics from July until October 2005. The vegetation in the clear ponds was characterized by extensive monospecific stands (Ceratophyllum, Chara, Nitella, Potamogeton, Nuphar and filamentous algae). Zooplankton could be analysed in seven different vegetation types and in the open water zones and contained a total of 17 cladoceran and 27 rotifer genera. Principal components analysis (PCA) ordination of zooplankton communities showed a seasonal gradient and a tendency to group within-pond habitats, although they differed in macrophyte species and habitat structure. Despite the absence of clustering of similar microhabitats across ponds, percent volume infested (PVI), vegetation biomass density and Daphnia length (used as a proxy for fish predation pressure) contributed significantly positive to the Shannon zooplankton biodiversity indices. Moreover, densities of most zooplankton subgroups and of total zooplankton were significantly and positively related to PVI. It is assumed that in eutrophic ponds, extensive, often monospecific macrophyte vegetations provide an ecological environment suitable for both macrophyte-associated species and migrating pelagic zooplankton, thereby maintaining a high microinvertebrate biodiversity.					; Van Onsem, Stijn/AAE-9572-2019	Triest, Ludwig/0000-0002-4946-9614; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2010	656	1					67	81		10.1007/s10750-010-0442-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0442-1													WOS:000282180300007

The results indicated that littoral zones were the "hotspots" of N2O emissions (-278 similar to 2 101 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)). While the littoral zone accounted for only 5.4% of the area of Meiliang Bay, the N2O emissions from the littoral zones were about 43.6% of total emissions from the bay. The importance of spatial variation on N2O emissions was demonstrated by dividing the lake into four unique zones through cluster analysis. The eulittoral zone was the key area of N2O emissions with an annual 5% trimmed mean 429.5 mu g N2O m(-2) h-1, following by supralittoral (138.8 mu g N2O m(2) h(-1)), infralittoral (98.9 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)), and pelagic zones (15.7 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)). Further, N2O emissions showed a seasonal trend. Excessive N2O emissions during algal bloom periods suggested that algae played a significant role in the emission of N2O. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Dissolved methane in Indian freshwater reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Emission of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, from tropical reservoirs is of interest because such reservoirs experience conducive conditions for CH4 production through anaerobic microbial activities. It has been suggested that Indian reservoirs have the potential to emit as much as 33.5 MT of CH4 per annum to the atmosphere. However, this estimate is based on assumptions rather than actual measurements. We present here the first data on dissolved CH4 concentrations from eight freshwater reservoirs in India, most of which experience seasonal anaerobic conditions and CH4 buildup in the hypolimnia. However, strong stratification prevents the CH4-rich subsurface layers to ventilate CH4 directly to the atmosphere, and surface water CH4 concentrations in these reservoirs are generally quite low (0.0028-0.305 mu M). Moreover, only in two small reservoirs substantial CH4 accumulation occurred at depths shallower than the level where water is used for power generation and irrigation, and in the only case where measurements were made in the outflowing water, CH4 concentrations were quite low. In conjunction with short periods of CH4 accumulation and generally lower concentrations than previously assumed, our study implies that CH4 emission from Indian reservoirs has been greatly overestimated.

Although the government and the community have devoted considerable time and energy over a long period to removing the invasive weed mechanically and manually, the weed has been increasing significantly. Accurate, reliable, and timely information on the spatiotemporal distribution and extent of water hyacinth is crucial to determine its evolution, propagation, and potentially vulnerable areas of the Lake. Therefore, comprehensive information on the spatial distribution of water hyacinths and their annual and seasonal variability is essential for Lake Tana's water resource planning, development, and management. This study aims to evaluate the spatiotemporal pattern of water hyacinth and its dynamics with seasonal climate variability and impact on evapotranspiration. Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel 2 and meteorological datasets were employed. Supervised and manual digitization image classification methods were applied to prepare Land-use/ Land-cover in the Lake. The Mann-Kendall trend test and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to evaluate the trend of water hyacinth and the impact of climate variability on water hyacinth distribution respectively. Besides, the evapotranspiration and water losses were estimated using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith method. The surface extent of the water hyacinth in Lake Tana has increased by 96% in 2019 from 2011. However, the surface area of the Lake has declined. That means 1603 ha of water surface area has been changed to land surface from 2011 to 2019. The average volume of water loss in Lake Tana was 0.21% of the volume of the Lake from September 2016 to December 2018.					; Abebe, Takele/MTF-9674-2025; Nega, Worku/AAR-7698-2021	Abebe, Takele/0000-0003-3980-0147; Nega, Worku/0000-0002-9774-5337; 													2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2023	13	9							170	10.1007/s13201-023-01975-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-023-01975-6													WOS:001048581400001
J	Blagrave, K; Sharma, S				Blagrave, Kevin; Sharma, Sapna			Projecting climate change impacts on ice phenology across Midwestern and Northeastern United States lakes	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Lakes are sensitive indicators of climate change as freshwater requires temperatures below 0 & DEG;C to freeze. Here, we used 34-year records for 74 lakes distributed across the Midwestern and Northeastern United States to ask the following: (i) Which physical factors affect lake ice phenology in the Northern United States?; (ii) Can an empirical statistical modelling approach be used to effectively predict ice phenology across the morphologically diverse lakes of the Northern United States?; and (iii) How much ice is forecasted to be lost in response to climate change? We find that our study lakes require 19 days with air temperatures below 0 & DEG;C to freeze, ranging from 4 days for small lakes to 53 days for larger lakes. To thaw, lakes require 22 days with air temperatures above 0 & DEG;C, ranging from 8 to 33 days. We find that 64% of the variation in ice-on dates is explained by air temperatures, and the remaining 36% of variation is explained by lake morphology, primarily mean depth. For ice-off dates, 80-90% of the variation is explained by air temperatures. By the end of the century in response to climate change, these lakes may lose 43 days of ice cover, although ranging from 12 days of less ice cover to no ice cover at all. Understanding the drivers of variability in ice phenology for lakes within regions found to be highly sensitive to climate change will promote our understanding of ice cover and ice loss, and also the widespread ecological ramifications associated with ice loss.

J	Meng, DH; Mao, JQ; Li, WF; Zhu, SJ; Gao, H				Meng, Dinghua; Mao, Jingqiao; Li, Weifeng; Zhu, Shijie; Gao, Huan			An Integrated Framework for Remote Sensing Assessment of the Trophic State of Large Lakes	REMOTE SENSING												The trophic state is an important factor reflecting the health state of lake ecosystems. To accurately assess the trophic state of large lakes, an integrated framework was developed by combining remote sensing data, field monitoring data, machine learning algorithms, and optimization algorithms. First, key meteorological and environmental factors from in situ monitoring were combined with remotely sensed reflectance data and statistical analysis was used to determine the main factors influencing the trophic state. Second, a trophic state index (TSI) inversion model was constructed using a machine learning algorithm, and this was then optimized using the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) based on a backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) to establish an SSA-BP-NN model. Third, a typical lake in China (Hongze Lake) was chosen as the case study. The application results show that, when the key environmental factors (pH, temperature, average wind speed, and sediment content) and the band combination data from Sentinel-2/MSI were used as input variables, the performance of the model was improved (R2 = 0.936, RMSE = 1.133, MAPE = 1.660%, MAD = 0.604). Compared with the performance prior to optimization (R2 = 0.834, RMSE = 1.790, MAPE = 2.679%, MAD = 1.030), the accuracy of the model was improved by 12.2%. It is worth noting that this framework could accurately identify water bodies in different trophic states. Finally, based on this framework, we mapped the spatial distribution of TSI in Hongze Lake in different seasons from 2019 to 2020 and analyzed its variation characteristics. The framework can combine regional special feature factors influenced by a complex environment with S-2/MSI data to achieve an assessment accuracy of over 90% for TSI in sensitive waters and has strong applicability and robustness.					; Zhu, Shijie/HTS-2152-2023; 孟, 定华/HKF-2844-2023	Gao, Huan/0009-0006-3404-1224; , weifeng/0000-0003-1212-4345; 														2072-4292				SEP	2023	15	17							4238	10.3390/rs15174238	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15174238													WOS:001060685000001

While turbidity is not a direct biochemical indicator of lake water quality, it is relatively easy to measure and indicates trophic status and lake health. Although ocean color satellites have been widely used to monitor water color parameters, their coarse spatial resolution makes it hard to capture the fine spatial variability of turbidity in lakes. The combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat provides an opportunity to monitor lake turbidity with high spatial and temporal resolution. This study aims to generate consistent turbidity products in Taihu Lake from 2018 to 2022 using the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on board Sentinel-2A/B and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on board Landsat-8/9. We first tested the performance of three atmospheric correction methods to retrieve consistent reflectance from MSI and OLI images. We found that the Rayleigh correction and a subtraction of the SWIR band from Rayleigh-corrected reflectance can generate the most consistent reflectance (the coefficient of determination (R2) > 0.84, the mean absolution percentage error (MAPE) < 7%, the median error (ME) < 0.0035, and slope > 0.92). Machine learning models outperformed an existing semi-analytical retrieval algorithm in retrieving turbidity (MSI: R2 = 0.92, MAPE = 18.78%, and OLI: R2 = 0.93, MAPE = 16.20%). The consistency of turbidity from the same-day MSI and OLI images was also satisfactory (N = 3110 and MAPE = 26.48%). The distribution of turbidity exhibited obvious spatial and seasonal variability in Taihu Lake from 2018 to 2022. The results show the potential of MSI and OLI when combined to monitor inland lake water quality.

The diet consists of a broad spectrum of prey items, including mollusca (Bellamya sp. and Physa sp.), aquatic insects (Odonata sp., Chironomidae sp., and Cirolanidae sp.), other macroinvertebrates (Nematoda sp. and Rhynchobdellida sp.), shrimp (Palaemon modestus and Gammarus sp.), fish (Rhinogobius giurinus and Tridentiger bifasciatus), fish eggs, and detritus. Dominant diets shifted from Rhynchobdellida sp. and unidentified digested food in July to P. modestus during September and November, and then shifted to both P. modestus and R. giurinus. Additionally, cannibalism was observed in March before spawning season of the goby, during which large males (SL > 70.0 mm) predated on small-sized ones. We suggest that broad spectrum of prey items and apparent seasonal shifting of dominant diets in the invasive goby fish, which might be an important mechanism favoring its successful invasion in water transfer system.

The results showed that Fe, Mn and Ni in water, As and Cd in sediment as well as As, Cd, Cr, Mn and Ni in O. vittatus muscle samples near the gold-copper mine exceeded standard values. Furthermore, the chromosome assessment in O. vittatus revealed seven types of chromosome aberrations, and the highest total number of chromosome aberrations was a centromere gap. The total number of chromosome aberrations, cell number with chromosome aberrations and percentage of chromosome aberrations in O. vittatus as well as serum liver enzymes between the studied areas were significantly different (p < 0.05). The liver histopathological alterations of the fish near the gold-copper mine revealed atypical cellular structures as nuclear membrane degeneration, rough endoplasmic reticulum disintegration and abnormal cytoplasmic mitochondria. The results of this study suggested that heavy metal and metalloid contaminations from the Sepon gold-copper mine area negatively affect O. vittatus fish in terms of chromosomal defects, serum biochemical changes and liver histopathological appearances.

Hence, in order to explore the possibility of the Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to monitor the water-induced crustal deformation, we use the Cryosat-2/SIRAL altimeter data to investigate the variations of Lake Qinghai level and its impacts on local crustal deformation from July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018. We apply the load Green's function method to model the loading deformation field around the Lake Qinghai region and compared it with GPS measurements. The results show that the Cryosat-2/SIRAL altimeter can effectively monitor the water level changes of Lake Qinghai, and the lake water level rises at a rate of 0.19 m/yr and exhibits obvious seasonality. The vertical deformation is more sensitive to changes in water level than the horizontal deformation. The apparent loading displacements induced by lake level change are mainly distributed within 25 km of the boundary of Lake Qinghai, with the horizontal and vertical displacements exceeding 1 and -3 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the accumulative vertical and horizontal displacements of -7 and 2 mm are found at the boundary of Lake Qinghai during the period from July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018 and the detected linear trend of displacements are about -0.70 mm/yr and 0.15 mm/yr, respectively. The modeled loading displacements and GPS measurements at QHGC station have good trend consistency in the vertical component, but the amplitude consistency and correlation coefficient are not satisfactory, which may be caused by the resolution of GPS data, the uncertainty of modeled loading displacement and the remote geographical location of QHGC station. The feasibility to monitor the local crustal deformation caused by Lake Qinghai level change with geodetic techniques such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) still needs further study.

This variation of surface-water delta(13)C-DIC among lakes is greater than the seasonal variation within most lakes. Several statistical models account for a large portion of the interlake variation and indicate that geochemical (e.g., DIC, pH, alkalinity) and morphometric (area) variables are important, whereas biological (e.g., gross primary productivity [GPP], respiration [R], chlorophyll a) variables are generally not significant. A process-based model including gas exchange with the atmosphere, inorganic carbon speciation, and ecosystem metabolism was also constructed. The model provides a reasonable fit to the data for lakes, in which respiration exceeded GPP (heterotrophic lakes; 75% of lakes sampled). Lakes for which GPP exceeded respiration (autotrophic) were not fit well by the process-based model. The data and models indicate that metabolism creates substantial variation in delta(13)C-DIC around the potential delta(13)C-DIC that is set by geochemical factors of the watershed.

J	Hahn, MW; Höfle, MG				Hahn, MW; Höfle, MG			Grazing of protozoa and its effect on populations of aquatic bacteria	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Predation by bactcrivorous protists in aquatic habitats can influence the morphological structure, taxonomic composition and physiological status of bacterial communities. The protistan grazing can result in bacterial responses at the community and the species level. At the community level, grazing-induced morphological shifts have been observed, which were directed towards either larger or smaller bacterial sizes or in both directions. Morphological changes have been accompanied by changes in taxonomic community structure and bacterial activity. Responses at the species level vary from species to species. Some taxa have shown a pronounced morphological plasticity and demonstrated complete or partial shifts in size distribution to larger growth forms (Filaments, microcolonies). However, other taxa with weak plasticity have shown no ability to reduce grazing mortality through changes in size. The impact of protistan grazing on bacterial communities is based on the complex interplay of several parameters. These include grazing selectivity (by size and other features), differences in sensitivity of bacterial species to grazing, differences in responses of single bacterial populations to grazing (size and physiology), as well as the direct and indirect influence of grazing on bacterial growth conditions (substrate supply) and bacterial competition (elimination of competitors).

The present study was designed to unravel the mechanisms for the frequent variations of intracellular toxins related to the differences in cyanobacterial colonies during bloom seasons in Lake Taihu, China. Monitoring of Microcystis colonies during warm seasons indicated that the variations in microcystins in both concentrations and toxin species were associated with the frequent alteration of Microcystis colonies in Lake Taihu. High concentration of microcystins in the blooms was always associated with two Microcystis colonies, Microcystis flos-aquae and Microcystis aeruginosa, whereas when Microcystis wesenbergii was the dominant colonial type, the toxin production of the blooms was low. Additionally, environmental factors such as temperature and nutrition were also shown to have an effect on the toxin production of the blooms, and may also potentially influence the Microcystis species present. The results of the present study provides insight into a new consideration for quick water quality monitoring, assessment and risk alert in cyanobacterium- and toxin-contaminated freshwaters, which will be beneficial not only for water agencies but also for public health.

Mean zooplankton species richness during the ice-free season was generally low at high latitudes and altitudes. Further, lower species richness was recorded in western lakes, possibly reflecting constraints on migration and dispersal. However, despite obvious spatial limitations, geographic boundaries were only weak predictors of mean zooplankton richness. Similarly, lake surface area did not contribute positively to mean richness such as seen in other ecosystem surveys. Rather, intrinsic factors such as primary production and fish community (planktivore) structure were identified by regression analysis as the major predictors of zooplankton diversity, while a positive correlation was observed between species richness and total zooplankton biomass. However, in spite of a large number of variables included in this study, the predictive power of multiple regression models was modest (< 50% variance explained), pointing to a major role for within-lake properties, as yet unidentified intrinsic forces, stochasticity, or dispersal as constraints on zooplankton diversity in these lakes.					; Hessen, Dag/AFI-5448-2022; Hessen, Dag Olav/AFI-5448-2022	Bakkestuen, Vegar/0000-0003-2573-6615; Hessen, Dag Olav/0000-0002-0154-7847													0012-9658	1939-9170				FEB	2006	87	2					433	443		10.1890/05-0352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/05-0352								16637368					WOS:000236215400019

Experimental conditions included two mollusc sizes (15 and 23 mm), and three water temperatures (15, 20 and 25 degreesC) covering the normal seasonal range in the lower Parana river and Rio de la Plata estuary. Filtration rates obtained were, for the larger mussels: 9.9, 13.1 and 17.7 ml mg tissue dry weight(-1) h(-1) at 15, 20 and 25 degreesC, respectively; and for the smaller ones: 17.7, 20.8 and 29.5 ml mg(-1) h(-1). Differences between sizes and between temperatures (except 15 vs. 20 degreesC) were statistically significant. In absolute terms larger animals have higher clearance rates, but as a function of body mass smaller individuals feed more actively. Within the range of experimental values used, filtration rates were positively associated with water temperature. These clearance rates (125-350 ml individual(-1) h(-1)) are among the highest reported for suspension feeding bivalves, including the invasive species Dreissena polymorpha, D. bugensis and Corbicula fluminea. High. filtration rates, associated with the very high densities of this mollusc in the Parana watershed (up to over 200,000 ind m(-2)) suggest that its environmental impact may be swiftly changing ecological conditions in the areas colonized.

Monitoring and experiments were performed from December 2003 to January 2005 in one of the widest (81 ha) freshwater wetlands in the Po river floodplain (Natural Reserve Paludi del Busatello, Italy). Intact sediment cores were sampled on a seasonal basis. Sediment-water fluxes of oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, methane, and inorganic nitrogen were determined under oxic and anoxic conditions. Oxic-anoxic transitions always resulted in enhanced ammonium, dissolved inorganic carbon, and methane effluxes. At high temperatures, the methane release from sediments was inversely related to both nitrate concentrations and uptake. Likely, nitrate can compensate for the oxygen deficiency while maintaining an oxidative metabolism, either supporting microbial decomposition as an electron acceptor or stimulating the oxidation of the byproducts of the anaerobic metabolism, e.g., methane. This is a key point as the number of temperate wetlands with concurrent nitrate pollution and oxygen shortage is increasing throughout the world.

Littoral fish community response to smallmouth bass removal from an Adirondack lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Large-scale observational studies in eastern Canada and the northeastern USA have concluded that introduced littoral predators are responsible for reductions in native fish diversity and abundance. To determine whether normative predator removal could increase native littoral fish abundance. we removed 47,682 smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu from a 271-ha Adirondack lake during a 6-year period. Two years after removal began, habitat-stratified snorkel surveys indicated a greater than 90% reduction in smallmouth bass abundance. The relative abundances of six native littoral species increased (4-90 miles preremoval abundances) within 2 years of smallmouth bass removal. Decreased relative predation risk during the experiment reflected the reduction in littoral predators and identified seasonal differences in nearshore predation risk. The smallmouth bass population was resilient to removal, producing strong year-classes throughout the experiment. Mechanical removal was successful at decreasing smallmouth bass abundance and increasing native fish abundance, but removal must be conducted on a yearly basis to maintain low smallmouth bass population abundance. Our results provide experimental evidence regarding the need to prevent littoral predator introductions in Adirondack waters and offer support for nonnative control wherever native fish species conservation is a management priority.

Evidence for earthquake triggering of large landslides in coastal Oregon, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Landslides are ubiquitous along the Oregon coast. Many are large, deep slides in sedimentary rock and are dormant or active only during the rainy season. Morphology, observed movement rates, and total movement suggest that many are at least several hundreds of years old. The offshore Cascadia subduction zone produces great earthquakes every 300-500 years that generate tsunami that inundate the coast within minutes. Many slides and slide-prone areas underlie tsunami evacuation and emergency response routes. We evaluated the likelihood of existing and future large rockslides being triggered by pore-water pressure increase or earthquake-induced ground motion using field observations and modeling of three typical slides. Monitoring for 2-9 years indicated that the rockslides reactivate when pore pressures exceed readily identifiable levels. Measurements of total movement and observed movement rates suggest that two of the rockslides are 296-336 years old (the third could not be dated). The most recent great Cascadia earthquake was M 9.0 and occurred during January 1700, while regional climatological conditions have been stable for at least the past 600 years. Hence, the estimated ages of the slides support earthquake ground motion as their triggering mechanism. Limit-equilibrium slope-stability modeling suggests that increased pore-water pressures could not trigger formation of the observed slides, even when accompanied by progressive strength loss. Modeling suggests that ground accelerations comparable to those recorded at geologically similar sites during the M 9.0, 11 March 2011 Japan Trench subduction-zone earthquake would trigger formation of the rockslides. Displacement modeling following the Newmark approach suggests that the rockslides would move only centimeters upon coseismic formation; however, coseismic reactivation of existing rockslides would involve meters of displacement. Our findings provide better understanding of the dynamic coastal bluff environment and hazards from future subduction-zone earthquakes.

The number of click trains detected by stereo acoustic data loggers (A-tag) was converted to an estimate of the density of porpoises. First, an automated off-line filter was developed to detect a click train among noise, and the detection and false-alarm rates were calculated. Second, a density estimation model was proposed. The cue-production rate was measured by biologging experiments. The probability of detecting a cue and the area size were calculated from the source level, beam patterns, and a sound-propagation model. The effect of group size on the cue-detection rate was examined. Third, the proposed model was applied to estimate the density of finless porpoises at four locations from the Yangtze River to the inside of Poyang Lake. The estimated mean density of porpoises in a day decreased from the main stream to the lake. Long-term monitoring during 466 days from June 2007 to May 2009 showed variation in the density 0-4.79. However, the density was fewer than 1 porpoise/km(2) during 94% of the period. These results suggest a potential gap and seasonal migration of the population in the bottleneck of Poyang Lake.

Cache a Killer: Cache Valley virus seropositivity and associated farm management risk factors in sheep in Ontario, Canada	PLOS ONE												Cache Valley virus (CVV) disease is a mosquito-borne zoonosis endemic to North America. CVV disease is reported most often in sheep, causing lethal congenital deformities. There are limited data on CVV in Ontario, which is the largest sheep producing province in Canada. This study aimed to determine CVV seroprevalence in Ontario sheep flocks and investigate farm management factors associated with CVV exposure. A cross-sectional study was performed including 364 mature ewes across 18 farms selected from the five largest sheep districts in the province. A questionnaire was administered at each farm to determine farm management practices pertinent to the flock and ewes specifically sampled. Mixed multivariable logistic regression with a random effect for farm was conducted to assess associations between CVV seropositivity (outcome variable) and farm management risk factors (predictor variables). CVV seroprevalence was 33.2% in individual ewes (95% CI: 28.4%-38.1%) as determined by a virus neutralization assay with a titre > 4. Sixteen of the eighteen flocks (88.9%) had at least one CVV seropositive ewe. Increased age, smaller flock size, and sheep housing near wetlands, lakes, or ponds were found to be significantly associated with higher odds of CVV seropositivity. These findings are valuable in guiding breeding practices and housing during mosquito season to minimize infection and, ultimately, CVV disease in the flock.					; Ludwig, Antoinette/OOK-8969-2025	Bergevin, Michele d./0000-0001-7835-8924; 													1932-6203					AUG 24	2023	18	8							e0290443	10.1371/journal.pone.0290443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290443								37616323					WOS:001067701100049
J	Gamito, S; Coelho, S; Pérez-Ruzafa, A				Gamito, Sofia; Coelho, Susana; Perez-Ruzafa, Angel			Phyto- and zooplankton dynamics in two ICOLLs from Southern Portugal	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE					7th European Coastal Lagoons Symposium	MAR 01-04, 2016	Murcia, SPAIN	Univ Murcia, Campus Mare Nostrum, Fundac Seneca, Reg Murcia				Foz do Almargem and Salgados are two small, intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) located in the Portuguese southern coast, both remaining isolated from the sea throughout great part of the year. Based on environmental and biotic parameters, the first lagoon was classified as mesotrophic, with a greater marine influence, while the second one was classified as hypereutrophic. The plankton relations and seasonal variation were examined in both lagoons aiming at understanding the biological patterns here present and relating them with the environmental conditions, as well as inferring possible top-down or bottom-up control in the communities, determining also in which alternative trophic state they are: a clean water lagoon, with submerged macrophyte vegetation; or a turbid water lagoon, with only phytoplankton as primary producer. The plankton community greatly differs in the two lagoons. Salgados lagoon presented extremely high concentrations of phytoplankton, which form blooms throughout the year, mostly composed by potential harmful organisms. This lagoon also had very high densities of zooplankton. Phytoplankton and zooplankton density was always lower in Foz do Almargem. Rotifera, Ostracoda and Cladocera dominated the Zooplankton community in Salgados. In Foz do Almargem, Rotifera also dominates, together with other groups, such as annelids, crustaceans and mollusks larvae, which denotes a stronger marine influence. In both lagoons, organisms with body size inferior to 100 urn mainly composed the zooplankton. In Salgados lagoon, excess nutrient load induced a high density of phytoplankton, which is utilized by a high density of zooplankton, following a bottom-up control model. The lagoon clearly showed a permanent turbid-water alternative state due to excess nutrients. On Foz do Almargem, the frequent openings of the inlet throughout the wet season caused strong physical disturbance, which prevented the development of a stable planktonic community.

R. nigromaculata were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nmol/L of MC-LR for 6 h. Results show that exposure to I nmol/L to 100 nmol/L of MC-LR decreased sperm motility and number of sperm cells and increased the sperm abnormality rate, whose values were significantly different from those of the control (P < 0.01). Moreover, the same dosage of MC-LR increased reactive oxygen species production and malondialdehyde content. At the same time, antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione S-transferase) activity and glutathione reduced content rapidly increased, whereas antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity significantly decreased. These results imply that the defense system of the testes quickly responds to oxidative stress. Ultrastructural observation shows distention of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus and changes in the mitochondrial matrix color, cristae number, and morphology. Moreover, using real-time PCR, increased relative expressions of P450 aromatase and SF-1 genes were observed. The results demonstrate for the first time that MC-LR could induce toxicity in the male reproductive system of R. nigromaculata. The findings in this research will provide more insights into the relationships between aquatic microcystins and amphibians. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the Mediterranean region they are among the most remarkable, but also the most threatened habitats; thus, effective management and conservation plans need to consider their special hydrological and ecological features and requirements. They are mainly fishless systems and so zooplankton is the driver of the trophic cascade. Our aim was to determine zooplankton communities' composition and biomass in seven temporary saline lakes of Cyprus and investigate their relation with environmental variables. Salinity ranged between <2 and 300 ppt and was a key factor shaping zooplankton community. In hyposaline conditions zooplankton communities exhibited higher species diversity than in meso- and hypersaline conditions. Hyposaline lakes were dominated by Arctodiaptomus salinus (Daday, 1885), Daphnia magna Straus, 1820 and Moina brachiata (Jurine, 1820) in terms of biomass, while meso- and hypersaline lakes by anostracans Artemia salina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Phallocryptus spinosus (Milne-Edwards, 1840) or M. brachiata and D. magna highlighting competition as another factor shaping the zooplankton community. We conclude that zooplankton reflects environmental pressures, such as salinity fluctuations which are closely related to water level fluctuations, in the mostly fishless Mediterranean temporary saline lakes. Moreover, salinity fluctuations should be considered a key factor for typological considerations in quality assessments, restoration and management plans in temporary saline systems since it can reflect the hydrological variations on the communities across different years and seasons by salinity gradient even for the same water body.					; Michaloudi, Evangelia/AAS-4574-2021	Dorflinger, Gerald/0000-0003-0209-4648; Stamou, Georgia/0000-0002-0709-3698; Michaloudi, Evangelia/0000-0001-8194-2865													0003-4088	2100-000X				APR 5	2018	54								14	10.1051/limn/2018007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2018007													WOS:000429643400002

Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria of the Kislo-Sladkoe stratified lake (White Sea, Kandalaksha Bay)	MICROBIOLOGY												The community of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APB) in the water column of the Kislo-Sladkoe stratified lake recently isolated from the sea (White Sea, Kandalaksha Bay) was investigated in September 2010. The water of the sulfide-rich zone was greenish-brown due to intense development of green sulfur bacteria (GSB). Nine APB strains were isolated from the water samples: three belonging to GSB, five, to purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), and one, to purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNB). GSB predominated in the phototrophic community of the chemocline. Unexpectedly, two morphologically different green-colored GSB strains were found to be phylogenetically identical and related to the brown-colored Chlorobium phaeovibrioides (99% similarity according to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing). Homology to the closest green-colored species (Chlorobium luteolum) was 98%. Two morphologically and physiologically similar PSB strains (TcrPS10 and AmPS10) had rounded cells containing okenone and gas vesicles. According to the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, these strains were most closely related (99%) to two different Thiocapsa species: Tca. marina (containing okenonee and no gas vesicles) and Tca. rosea (containing spirilloxanthin and gas vesicles). The remaining isolates of purple bacteria were similar to the already described APB species.

Planktonic foraminifera as indicators of oceanographic complexity on the southern Caribbean Sea continental shelf	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The southern Caribbean Sea over the northern South American continental shelf is oceanographically complex. It is subject to (1) widespread coastal upwelling, (2) wakes and eddies in the NW-flowing Guiana and Caribbean Currents to the lee of islands, and (3) the hypopycnal Orinoco River plume. Upwelled water is dispersed NW along high-productivity filaments. Offshore northern Trinidad, an intra-plume front separates higher-productivity Orinoco-derived water to the west from lower-productivity Amazon-derived water. This paper examines planktonic foraminiferal assemblages in surface sediment samples (a) below upwelling foci in the Gulf of Venezuela (GoV). North of Lake Maracaibo, and (b) at an upwelling focus in the North Coast Marine Area (NCMA) offshore northern Trinidad, near but west of the intra-plume front. The samples were collected for previous studies and only certain size fractions, which differed between the study areas, were available for current study. Samples from the GoV (> 250 mu m fraction; taken using an Alpine corer or a Petersen dredge) were assigned a priori to groups underlying upwelled and non-upwelled water. Discriminant analysis after cluster analysis confirmed these assignments. Total recovery was dominated by Neogloboquadrina dutertrei with lesser Globigerinoides ruber(pink) and the upwelling indicator Globigerina bulloides. All four non-upwelled samples, co-dominated by N. dutertrei and Gs. ruber(pink), reflect seasonal freshwater outflow from Lake Maracaibo. Five upwelled-area samples were dominated by G. bulloides with subdominant N. dutertrei or Giobigerinoides ruber Morphotype B. The remaining two upwelled samples (dominant N. dutertrei, subdominant Gs. ruber Morphotype A) apparently reflect the transition between upwelling and non-upwelling areas. The mean proportions of assemblages as Trilobatus sacculifer Morphotype A did not differ markedly between the upwelled and non-upwelled GoV clusters. This morphotype was absent from the Gulf proper but present to the north. NCMA total recovery (> 150 mu m fraction; samples taken using a van Veen grab) was dominated by Gs. ruber Morphotype B. Cluster analysis here indicated three clusters: Cluster 1, proximal to the intra-plume front; Cluster 2, distal to the intra-plume front; and Cluster 3, scattered throughout the NCMA. Upwelling was pervasive, canonical variate analysis (CVA) verifying that G. bulloides did not differentiate the clusters. Instead, these clusters were differentiated by Gs. ruber Morphotype B only, the proportional abundance of which was highest in Cluster I and lowest in Cluster 2. This pattern indicates that the influence of the Orinoco plume on assemblage composition is stronger than that of upwelling, Cluster 1 reflecting higher productivity near the front.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				NOV 15	2019	228								106359	10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106359													WOS:000496611500006
J	Höhn, A; Neumann, K				Hoehn, Alexa; Neumann, Katharina			THE PALAEOVEGETATION OF JANRUWA (NIGERIA) AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DECLINE OF THE NOK CULTURE	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGY												Settlement activities of the Nok Culture considerably decreased around 400 BCE and ended around the beginning of the Common Era. For a better understanding of the decline of the Nok Culture, we studied the charcoal assemblage of the post-Nok site Janruwa C, dating to the first centuries CE. Janruwa C differs from Middle Nok sites in ceramic inventory and a wider set of crops. 20 charcoal types were identified. Most taxa are characteristic of humid habitats such as riverine forests, while those savanna woodland charcoal types that had been dominant in Middle Nok samples are only weakly represented. The differences between the Middle Nok and post-Nok assemblages do not indicate vegetation change, but rather different human exploitation behaviors. It seems that the Nok people avoided forest environments while in the first centuries CE, other, possibly new populations settled closer to the forest and were more familiar with its resources. The new exploiting strategies might be explained as adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Our results, together with data from other palaeo-archives in the wider region, point to climatic change as a potential factor for the decline of the Nok Culture. We argue that erosion on the hill slopes, maybe due to stronger seasonality, was responsible for land degradation after 400 BCE and that the Nok people were not flexible enough to cope with this challenge through innovations.

Several studies based on qualitative comparisons of the amount of macrophytes were carried out to relate benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages to habitat conditions in shallow lakes. Our main aim was to analyze the effects of habitat type and trophic state on taxonomic composition and abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates in lowland shallow lakes based on quantitative classification of habitat types. The benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were investigated in eight shallow lakes of eastern China in four seasons. A total of 33 species was collected from these lakes, including four Oligochaeta, eight Chironomidae, eight Gastropoda, four Bivalvia and nine other miscellaneous species. According to the ratio of the dry weight of macrophytes to the dry weight of phytoplankton, the study lakes were separated into three lake types; macrophyte-dominated, transitional, and algae-dominated regions. The total abundance of macroinvertebrates was significantly higher in the group of algae-dominated regions than in the macrophyte-dominated regions. Scrapers had the highest abundance in the macrophyte-dominated regions. Univariate and multivariate analyses results showed that abundance, biomass and characteristic species of benthic macroinvertebrates were affected by their habitat types. The abundance and biomass of macroinvertebrates showed significant positive correlations with the trophic state index (TSI). TSI and turbidity were significantly correlated with DC1 (Axis 1 of detrended correspondence analysis), while Chlorophyll a and the ratio of the dry weight of macrophytes to the dry weight of phytoplankton were significantly correlated with DC2. The findings indicated that the habitat type and trophic state were the key factors determining the structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland shallow lakes. Our study was one of the few studies that had demonstrated the distinct influence of habitat type on macroinvertebrate assemblages in shallow lakes according to the ratio of the dry weight of macrophytes to the dry weight of phytoplankton.

Water storage change (WSC) is an important factor in water cycle. We used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to retrieve WSC in the Three-River Source Region and subregions. WSC in four types of permafrost (continuous, seasonal, island, and patchy permafrost) was analyzed during 2003-2010. Theresult showed that WSC had significant change; it increased by 9.06 +/- 0.01 mm/a (21.89 +/- 0.02x10(9)m(3)) over the Three-River Source Region during the study period. The most significant changes of WSC were in continuous permafrost zone, with a total amount of about 13.94 +/-+0.48x10(9)m(3). The spatial distribution of WSC was in state of gain in the continuous permafrost zone, whereas it was in a state of loss in the other permafrost zones. Little changes of precipitation and runoff occurred in study area, but the WSC increased significantly, according to water balance equation, the changes of runoff and water storage were subtracted from changes of precipitation, and the result showed that changes of evaporation is minus which means the evaporation decreased in the Three-River Source Region during 2003-2010.

In 1999, a binational study was initiated to examine the annual diet composition and fish consumption of cormorants at colonies in the upper river. Since 1999, 14,032 cormorant pellets, collected from May through September each year, have been examined from St Lawrence River colonies to estimate fish consumption and determine temporal and spatial variation in diet. Seasonal variation in diet composition within a colony was low. Prior to 2006 yellow perch was the primary fish consumed by cormorants in the upper St. Lawrence River. Round goby were first observed in cormorant diets in 2003 and by 2006 were the main fish consumed at two of the three colonies. The time interval it took from the first appearance of round goby in the diet at a colony to when goby were the dominant prey species varied by island, ranging from two to five years. Daily fish consumption at each cormorant colony increased significantly from the pre-round goby to post-round goby period. The mean annual biomass of yellow perch consumed decreased significantly during the post-round goby period at the three colonies. Reduced consumption of yellow perch by cormorants may alleviate suspected localized impacts on perch near some of the larger river colonies.

J	Chen, L; Fan, M; Wang, Q				Chen, Li; Fan, Min; Wang, Qing			Spatial priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat across the Upper Reaches of Min River located in Sichuan Province, China	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Considered as a hotspot for biodiversity in the upstream of Yangtze River, many vegetation habitats have been seriously damaged in Upper Reaches of Min River located in Sichuan Province, China due to the continuous deterioration of ecosystems. This work aims to define important protected areas with higher vegetation habitat suitability index. Through integrating the spatial distribution of vegetation habitat suitability (HS) index into systematic conservation planning, this study constructed spatial priority conservation areas of vegetation habitat under different protection targets in the Upper Reaches of Min River, China. In this regard, effective information regarding vegetation HS and its priority conservation planning responded to conservation target level changes and boundary length effect provide useful support for diverse stakeholders in vegetation habitat planning, management and policies. The southeastern places played an important role in the priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat, and there were more conservation areas located in east of study site than west. As increasing of target levels (ranged 10%-90% percentages of summing amount for vegetation HS index at watershed scale), the spatial priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat gradually extended from the south to the north. The spatial structure of priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat with boundary length effect was more compact than that without boundary length effect. The total priority conservation areas with boundary length effect were approximate to those without boundary length effect, but the total boundary length of former was far less than that of latter. It suggested that integrating boundary length effect to systematic conservation planning of vegetation habitat could produce more aggregated conservation patches and increase connectivity among patches. The total priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat were traded off against total boundary length of reserve networks. It indicated that this tradeoff information could help stakeholder to reasonably allocate investment to maintain reserve network under different target levels. The proposed approach could provide useful information to assess the responses of priority conservation areas for vegetation habitat to different protected targets and boundary length effect, and also guarantee ecosystem sustainability across watershed.

Groundwater geochemistry, hydrogeology and potash mineral potential of the Lake Woods region, Northern Territory, Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												We collected 38 groundwater and two surface-water samples in the semi-arid Lake Woods region of the Northern Territory to better understand the hydrogeochemistry of this system, which straddles the Wiso, Tennant Creek and Georgina geological regions. Lake Woods is presently a losing waterbody feeding the underlying groundwater system. The main aquifers comprise mainly carbonate (limestone and dolostone), siliciclastic (sandstone and siltstone) and evaporitic units. The water composition was determined in terms of bulk properties (pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, redox potential), 40 major, minor and trace elements, and six isotopes (O-18(water), H-2(water), C-13(DIC), S-34(SO4)2-, O-18(SO4)2-, Sr-87/Sr-86). The groundwater is recharged through infiltration in the catchment from monsoonal rainfall (annual average rainfall approximate to 600mm) and runoff. It evolves geochemically mainly through evapotranspiration and water-mineral interaction (dissolution of carbonates, silicates and to a lesser extent sulfates). The two surface waters (one from the main creek feeding the lake, the other from the lake itself) are extraordinarily enriched in O-18 and H-2 isotopes (O-18 of +10.9 and +16.4 parts per thousand VSMOW, and H-2 of +41 and +93 parts per thousand VSMOW, respectively), which is interpreted to reflect evaporation during the dry season (annual average evaporation approximate to 3000mm) under low humidity conditions (annual average relative humidity approximate to 40%). This interpretation is supported by modelling results. The potassium (K) relative enrichment (K/Cl- mass ratio over 50 times that of sea water) is similar to that observed in salt-lake systems worldwide that are prospective for potash resources. Potassium enrichment is believed to derive partly from dust during atmospheric transport/deposition, but mostly from weathering of K-silicates in the aquifer materials (and possibly underlying formations). Further studies of Australian salt-lake systems are required to reach evidence-based conclusions on their mineral potential for potash, lithium, boron and other low-temperature mineral system commodities such as uranium.					de+Caritat, Patrice/AAZ-2456-2020; Mernagh, Terry/P-6457-2019; Dulfer, Helen/V-2501-2018	, Evgeniy/0009-0002-5449-2584; Mernagh, Terrence/0000-0002-8555-0110; de Caritat, Patrice/0000-0002-4185-9124; Dulfer, Helen/0000-0002-7544-9940													0812-0099	1440-0952					2019	66	3					411	430		10.1080/08120099.2018.1543208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099.2018.1543208													WOS:000466535400004

This study aims to investigate why FGA has stronger growth advantage than that of submerged macrophytes in the co-culture system. Assimilation of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients, kinetics, and interspecific nutrient competition model were studied to determine the dynamic changes in nutrient assimilation between submerged macrophytes and FGA in a co-culture system with ion depletion technique. The results showed that differences were observed in the assimilation of nitrogen and phosphorus by Vallisneria natans, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Cladophora oligoclona. C. oligoclona was able to assimilate and accumulate much more nitrogen than V. natans and C. demersum, with the content of nitrogen of 5.75% (dry mass). The lower value of Michaelis-Menten constant K m (0.34 mg/L) of C. demersum indicated that C. demersum had a greater affinity for phosphate. The interspecific competition results confirmed that the coexistence of V. natans and C. oligoclona, and C. demersum and C. oligoclona were unstable. Moreover, C. demersum had a stronger competitive ability than V. natans, and it can be used as a pioneer species for the recovery of submerged vegetation in eutrophic lakes.					zhang, lu/GRO-2969-2022; Dong, Xu/AAO-8324-2020; LIU, Qi/I-4900-2017														1230-1485	2083-5906					2019	28	3					1483	1494		10.15244/pjoes/87097	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/87097													WOS:000461800200045

Understanding the seasonal changes in DOM composition and their reactivity in DBP formation could lead to a better treatment of drinking water and a more consistent water quality. DOM from the East-Lake, a reservoir in the south-China, was fractionated and characterized by XAD resin adsorption (RA) and ultrafiltration (UF) techniques during different seasons within a year. The properties of chemical fractions (isolated by RA) appeared more stable than those of physical fractions (separated by UF) throughout the sampling period. The relative contribution of each chemical fraction to the total dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV254 absorbance and trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) remained relatively constant across the sampling period. However, the physical (molecular weight) fractions of the DOM exhibited large seasonal changes in UV254 and THMFP. Compared to the parameter of DOC, the THMFP and specific THMFP (STHMFP) of either chemical or physical fractions were more variable. In terms of DOC concentration, the hydrophobic acids (HoA) and hydrophilic matter (HiM) dominated in the DOM in most of the seasons; while the components with molecular weight of 10-30 kDa and less than I kDa were the predominant physical fractions.

On the differences between Last Glacial Maximum and Mid-Holocene climates in southern South America simulated by PMIP3 models	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Differences between climate conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Mid-Holocene (MH) in southern South America inferred from the state-of-the-art PMIP3 paleoclimatic simulations are described for the first time in this paper. The aim is to expose characteristics of past climate changes occurred without human influence. In this context, numerical simulations are an indispensable tool for inferring changes in near-surface air temperature and precipitation in regions where proxy information is scarce or absent. The analyzed PMIP3 models describe MH temperatures significantly warmer than those of LGM with magnitudes of change depending on the season and the specific geographic region. In addition, models indicate that seasonal mean precipitation during MH increased with respect to LGM values in wide southern continental areas to the east of the Andes Cordillera whereas seasonal precipitation developed in areas to the w2est of Patagonian Andes reduced from LGM to MH.

However, knowledge of their distribution in Brazilian ecosystems is still incomplete and fragmented. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop an inventory of aquatic oligochaetes in the Extractive Reserve of Lake Cunia in the State of Rondania, Brazil. Collections of data were performed during the dry (August 2015) and rainy seasons (February 2016). The sediment samples were collected near the lakeside region using the kick sampling method and a kick-net sampler (mesh size of 0.25mm). This paper provides a catalog with 12 taxon from a total of 383 specimens, distributed into two families: Naididae (95.08%) and Opistocystidae (4.92%). The Pristininae subfamily was the most significant (85.68%), followed by subfamilies: Naidinae (8.36%), Tubificinae (0.52%) and Rhyacondrilinae (0.52%). In addition, some species such as Allonais inaequalis, Aulophorus furcatus, Dero nivea, Pristina synclites, Pristina menoni and Opistocysta serrata, were recorded for the first time in the Brazilian Amazon region. Therefore, the results of this study contribute to increase knowledge on the distribution of the Oligochaeta class in Brazil, particularly in the North of the country, which is so extensive and rich in water resources, but not extensively studied.					; Gorni, Guilherme/AAI-8148-2020; Gomes, Diego/AGJ-1271-2022	Gorni, Guilherme/0000-0002-9156-6864; Ferreira Gomes, Diego/0000-0003-4434-0683; 													1676-0603	1676-0611					2017	17	1							e20160232	10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2016-0232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2016-0232													WOS:000393679800006

Water samples from 20 sites in the main stream and tributaries were collected in the dry and wet seasons. The delta N-15-NO3- ranged from 0.97 to 8.60%, and was significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season, and significantly higher in tributaries than in the main stream. In the dry season, NO3- concentrations and delta N-15-NO3- were significantly negatively correlated with forest and grassland areas, and positively correlated with paddy field and residential area. However, most of the correlations were not significant in the wet season. The results showed that fertilizer was the main source of nitrate in the Ganjiang River, and domestic sewage was important in the dry season, but its contribution was lower than that in other rivers in the Yangtze Basin. In the wet season, the intensified nitrogen cycle caused by high temperature and the mixing effect caused by rainfall made it difficult to trace nitrate sources using delta N-15-NO3- and land use.																			1025-6016	1477-2639					2017	53	5					539	551		10.1080/10256016.2017.1328417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2017.1328417								28545304					WOS:000407467200008

Earning their Stripes: The Potential of Tiger Trout and Other Salmonids as Biological Controls of Forage Fishes in a Western Reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Maintaining a balance between predator and prey populations can be an ongoing challenge for fisheries managers, especially in managing artificial ecosystems such as reservoirs. In a high-elevation Utah reservoir, the unintentional introduction of the Utah Chub Gila atraria and its subsequent population expansion prompted managers to experimentally shift from exclusively stocking Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to also stocking tiger trout (female Brown Trout Salmo trutta x male Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis) and Bonneville Cutthroat Trout O. clarkii utah (hereafter, Cutthroat Trout) as potential biological control agents. We measured a combination of diet, growth, temperature, and abundance and used bioenergetic simulations to quantify predator demand versus prey supply. Utah Chub were the predominant prey type for tiger trout, contributing up to 80% of the diet depending on the season. Utah Chub represented up to 70% of the total diet consumed by Cutthroat Trout. Although Utah Chub dominated the fish biomass in the reservoir, we still estimated abundances of 238,000 tiger trout, 214,000 Cutthroat Trout, and 55,000 Rainbow Trout. Consequently, when expanded to the population level of each predator, tiger trout and Cutthroat Trout consumed large quantities of Utah Chub on an annual basis: tiger trout consumed 508,000 kg (2,660 g/predator) of the standing prey population, and Cutthroat Trout consumed an estimated 322,000 kg (1,820 g/predator). The estimated combined consumption by Cutthroat Trout and tiger trout exceeded the estimate of Utah Chub annual production. As such, our results suggest that the high rates of piscivory exhibited by Cutthroat Trout and tiger trout in artificial lentic ecosystems are likely sufficient to effectively reduce the overall abundance of forage fishes and to prevent forage fishes from dominating fish assemblages. Collectively, this research provides the first documented findings on tiger trout ecology and performance, which will aid managers in designing and implementing the best stocking strategy to optimize sport fish performance, control undesirable forage fish, and enhance and maintain angler satisfaction.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2017	37	2					380	394		10.1080/02755947.2016.1264509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1264509													WOS:000399562800013

APPARENT NEST ABANDONMENT AS EVIDENCE OF BREEDING-SEASON MORTALITY IN GREAT LAKES PIPING PLOVERS (CHARADRIUS MELODUS)	AUK												Abandonment was the most frequent cause of nesting failure in Great Lakes Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) during 1993-2007, and observations of color-banded adults suggested that most abandonments involved disappearance of attendant adults rather than behavioral decisions by adults to desert their nests. The purpose of our study was to integrate nest-monitoring histories with mark-resighting analyses to determine whether nest abandonment indicated adult mortality or nest desertion. Nesting Piping Plovers had extremely high within-year resighting probabilities (10-day mean p = 0.908 +/- 0.025 [SE]), and cumulative probabilities of being detected approached 1 for individuals that were present on the breeding grounds for >= 20 days post-abandonment. These observations suggested that desertion would be readily identified unless Piping Plovers left the monitoring areas immediately after deserting their nests. None of the 31 that disappeared (as indicated by nest-monitoring histories) was ever observed again, and an among-year mark resighting analysis suggested that all had died. From 2002 to 2007, annual mortality associated with disappearances averaged 5.7% of the marked population. Disappearances occurred primarily from 16 May to 19 June, were more common among females, involved individuals that were older than average, and were most frequently attributed to predation by Merlins (Falco columbarius). Our results reveal that most early-season nest abandonment in Piping Plovers was attributable to the death of attendant adults. We believe that this phenomenon may be widespread among other species of birds in which adults are vulnerable to mortality during nesting.

Determining algal assemblages in oligotrophic lakes and streams: comparing information from newly developed pigment/chlorophyll a ratios with direct microscopy	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Pigment analyses by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are commonly used for determining algal groups in marine and estuarine areas but are underdeveloped in freshwaters. In this study, 15 characteristic pelagic algal species (representing five algal groups) of oligo-/mesotrophic lakes were cultured and pigment/Chl a ratios determined at three light intensities. 2. With the exception of cyanophytes, light treatment had little effect on pigment/Chl a ratios. This justifies the use of the same pigment/Chl a ratios during seasonal studies where light conditions may change. 3. The determined pigment/Chl a ratios were tested on seasonal samples from five oligo-/mesotrophic lakes and three streams using CHEMTAX software. Pigment ratios of both pelagic and benthic algal communities from the lakes and streams were analysed to determine whether the pelagic algae-based ratios can be used for benthic algal communities. 4. HPLC combined with CHEMTAX was useful for identifying freshwater phytoplankton classes and for quantifying the abundance of phytoplankton groups. However, although correlations were significant for six of seven phytoplankton classes studied, they were weak and varied with season. 5. HPLC was valid for quantifying benthic diatom groups in stream samples, whereas for lakes more benthic algal groups were recorded with HPLC than with microscopy and correlations between the two methods were not significant. 6. The use of both HPLC and microscopy is recommended as a cost-efficient method for analysing many samples. It is crucial, however, that the CHEMTAX software is calibrated with the correct information, and the user is aware of the limitations.					; Lauridsen, Torben/JAX-3118-2023	Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2011	56	8					1638	1651		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02588.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02588.x													WOS:000292446700015

The limit of detection was below 0.1 ng L(-1) (210 fM), which was the lowest concentration tested. Intra- and interday coefficients of variation were between 0.3-11.6% and 4.8-9.8%, respectively, at 1 ng 3kPZS L(-1) and 5 ng 3kPZS L(-1). This assay was validated by repeat measurements of water samples from a stream spiked with synthesized 3kPZS to reach 4.74 ng L(-1) or 0.24 ng L(-1). We further verified the utility of this assay to detect spawning populations of lampreys; in the seven tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes sampled, 3kPZS concentrations were found to range between 0.15 and 2.85 ng L(-1) during the spawning season in known sea lamprey infested segments and were not detectable in uninfested segments. The 3kPZS assay may be useful for the integrated management of sea lamprey, an invasive species in the Great Lakes where pheromone-based control and assessment techniques are desired.

Sampling was conducted during 2006-2007, including both rainy and dry seasons, and T-Hg was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Distribution of T-Hg in sediments and the macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes showed that higher concentrations were found along the flooding pathway of the Cauca River. Hg has also polluted the food chain. Highest T-Hg concentrations in fish were detected for the carnivorous Pseudoplatystoma fasciatun (0.432 +/- 0.107g/g, fresh weight [fw]), and lowest in the non-carnivorous Prochilodus magdalenae (0.143 +/- 0.053g/g, fw), with differences between trophic levels. T-Hg for fish samples (0.298 +/- 0.148g/g, fw) did not exceed the limit consumption level (0.50g/g, fw). It is concluded that mercury-polluted sediments from the Cauca River, contribute to Hg deposition into the Ayapel Marsh. Accordingly, interventions must be conducted to decrease Hg accumulation in fish.

J	Wittenberg, H; Aksoy, H				Wittenberg, H.; Aksoy, H.			Groundwater intrusion into leaky sewer systems	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Vast volumes of groundwater are drained by urban sewer systems. This unwanted flow component intrudes into sewer systems through leaky joints or connected house drains. However, unlike urban storm drainage, it has a high seasonal variation corresponding to groundwater storage and long slow recessions similar to baseflow in rivers also fed by shallow groundwater exfiltrating into the surface waters. By applying the nonlinear reservoir algorithm as used for baseflow separation from total flow in a river, groundwater flow is separated from daily measured influents to treatment plants in Lower Saxony and Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany and in the Terkos Lake watershed near Istanbul, Turkey. While waste water flows vary only moderately within a year, separated intruded groundwater flows show recessions and seasonal variations correlated to baseflow in neighbouring rivers. It is possible to conclude that recession characteristics of treatment plant influents allow quantification and prediction of groundwater intrusion into sewer systems.

Arthur			Assessment of phytoplankton diversity, distribution, and environmental variables along the southeast coast of India	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Coastal waters are dynamic because of anthropogenic activities that contribute nutrients and contaminants. These changes have the potential to alter patterns of primary production and thus pelagic food webs. Here, we investigated the spatial variation of the phytoplankton community and its response to changing environmental variables at 84 stations along the five coastal districts of Tamil Nadu (TN). During the present study, 85 phytoplankton species were recorded, such as diatoms (64), dinoflagellates (18), silicoflagellates (1), and Cyanophyceae (2). The maximum phytoplankton abundance was recorded on the Thanjavur coast and gradually decreased towards the south coast of Tamil Nadu. Among the phytoplankton community, 50% was dominated by pennate diatoms, attributed to higher NO3 - concentrations in the coastal waters due to agricultural discharge. Cluster analysis revealed that Ramanathapuram and Tirunelveli formed a closed cluster, whereas Thanjavur and Pudukottai formed a separate closed cluster associated with higher nutrient and metal concentrations, highlighting the difference in physicochemical parameters between the northern and southern districts of the TN coast. Relatively high nutrient concentrations in the coastal waters of northern districts are of greater concern, which could impact the coastal ecosystem. Coastal eutrophication is becoming a widespread phenomenon, causing disruption in the food chain and ecosystem balances and hence requiring regular monitoring and management.

We emphasised studying the role of man in modifying the vegetation of the area and the dominant agricultural practices during the Imperial Persia period (2,500-1,299 cal bp; 550 bc-ad 651), particularly the Achaemenid Empire (2,500-2,280 cal bp; 550-330 bc). Scattered pistachio-almond scrub combined with Quercus brantii was the main vegetation type of the basin during the period studied. The present study depicts a significant increase in agriculture, suggesting urban development during the Late Antiquity and early Islamic Iranian dynasties. The inferred chronology of arboricultural activities is compatible with historical evidence showing that Fars Province witnessed economic and agricultural flourishing during these periods. The presence of the 'Persian gardens' is supported by the co-increase of cypress tree pollen frequencies with pollen of other cultivated trees, especially Platanus; both trees were cultivated for their shade and symbolic values. This study also provides pollen evidence of Punica granatum during the Achaemenid period and Phoenix dactylifera cultivation during the early post-Sasanian era. The variations in indicator pollen ratios among Poaceae, Artemisia, and Amaranthaceae appear compatible with the palaeohydrology of the basin and show periods of aridity followed by higher moisture availability. We suggest that anthropogenic activities played the leading role in vegetation change in the Maharlou Lake basin enhanced by climatic changes during the last similar to 4,000 years.					; Djamali, Morteza/J-6247-2014; Nelle, Oliver/G-8137-2012; Naderi Beni, Abdolmajid/AAQ-5777-2020; BRISSET, Elodie/M-9867-2013; Poschlod, Peter/AAF-7902-2019	NADERI BENI, ABDOLMAJID/0000-0002-0825-1539; Nelle, Oliver/0000-0002-1033-6419; Saeidi Ghavi andam, Sara/0000-0002-9959-7235; BRISSET, Elodie/0000-0001-8706-0505; 													0939-6314	1617-6278				SEP	2021	30	5					595	610		10.1007/s00334-020-00810-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-020-00810-1		NOV 2020											WOS:000589560900002

Top-down control from the bottom: Regulation of eutrophication in a large river by benthic grazing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We use a 15-yr record from a 100-km stretch of the tidal, freshwater Hudson River to examine the controls of phytoplankton biomass. Across years, seasonal mean chlorophyll a (Chl a) and maximum Chl a varied by approximately 15-fold, with mean growing-season Chl a as high as 24 mu g L-1 and maximum Chl a as high as 120 mu g L-1. For 3 of the 15 yr the river would be classified as eutrophic on the basis of lake standards for Chl a. Year-to-year variation in Chl a was not closely related to either nutrients (phosphorus or nitrogen concentrations) or hydrologic flow. Annual variation in grazing by the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) explained 90% of the variation in mean Chl a; however, the maximum Chl a reached during the growing season was not significantly related to grazing and, even with high grazing, blooms of phytoplankton that contained high proportions of potentially toxic cyanobacteria occurred. Further, zebra mussels decreased dissolved oxygen concentrations even while increasing production of submersed aquatic vegetation. The results from the Hudson add to a growing literature that suggests that ecosystem changes linked with high phytoplankton biomass depend on a diverse range of system characteristics as well as whether phytoplankton are controlled by top-down or bottom-up mechanisms.

Assessing nonpoint-source nitrogen loading and nitrogen fixation in lakes using δ15N and nutrient stoichiometry	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Runoff from human-dominated watersheds has greatly altered nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling in lakes. Nutrients from human sources are distinct from those from undisturbed ecosystems in several ways including lower N: P ratios, which can drive ecosystems to N-limited conditions, and enriched stable N isotope ratios. In this study, we used these distinct characteristics to estimate shifts in N sources to 27 lakes across a human density gradient in western Washington. We compared an N stable isotope two-source mixing model with a mixing model that coupled N stable isotopes to N: P stoichiometry and included N fixation. We found that a two-source mixing model (human and watershed sources) did not explain observed variation in delta N-15 of particulate organic matter (POM) and primary consumers (R-2 = 0.60) as well as a model that included a third N source (N fixation; R-2 = 0.72). When fixed N was facultatively added to the ecosystem below a critical N: P ratio, the more complex mixing model captured the observed patterns in POM and primary-consumer delta N-15 among lakes extremely well. In lakes with P concentrations > 20 mu g L-1 (N : P mass ratio < 15.3), N fixation became an increasingly important component of the N cycle, accounting for > 50% of lake N budgets. This model provides a novel way to estimate the contribution of nonpoint N sources and N fixation to lakes in watersheds subject to human nutrient inputs.					; Holtgrieve, Gordon/C-5371-2009	Jankowski, Kathi Jo/0000-0002-3292-4182; Holtgrieve, Gordon/0000-0002-4451-3567													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2012	57	3					671	683		10.4319/lo.2012.57.3.0671	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2012.57.3.0671													WOS:000306239300001

While terrestrial n-alkanes reflect the isotopic signal of the local precipitation, aquatic n-alkanes incorporate the isotopic signal of the lake's water, which can be strongly modulated by evaporative enrichment. So far, the spatial distribution of the terrestrial and aquatic delta H-2 signal within lakes have not systematically been investigated. Here, we present compound-specific delta H-2 results of terrestrial (delta H-2(C31)) and aquatic (delta H-2(C23)) n-alkanes of surface sediment samples from Lake Khar Nuur, a semi-arid and high-altitude lake in the Mongolian Altai, and additionally investigate the delta H-2 signal of topsoils from the catchment. Our results show that the majority of the n-alkane delta H-2 values from the catchment topsoils correspond well with modeled local growing season precipitation (JJAS). However, few samples in the northern catchment show more positive delta H-2 values possibly due to increased evapo(transpi)ration by southward exposition and shallower soils there. The only small variability of delta H-2(C31) in the surface sediments is in the range of most topsoils delta H-2 from the catchment, and thus, well reflects local growing season precipitation. delta H-2(C23) in surface sediment samples from the central and deepest parts of the lake, that is, the lake's sediment accumulation zones, shows distinctly more positive delta H-2(C23) values due to evaporative lake water enrichment. Consequently, Delta(aq-terr), which is the isotopic offset between delta H-2(C23) and delta H-2(C31), indicates distinct lake water enrichment in the lake's accumulation zones and is a valuable proxy to investigate past hydrological changes.

However, the lack of high-resolution precipitation records over this period hampered our ability to characterize and constrain the forcing mechanism(s) of the recent humidity variations. Here, we present the ratio of hematite to goethite (Hm/Gt) derived from the semiquantitative evaluation of the diffuse reflectance spectroscopic analysis as a reliable and effective precipitation proxy to reconstruct the humidity variations during the past 1400 years deduced from Tengchongqinghai Lake sediments, southwestern China. Hm/Gt varied synchronously with variations of Chinese temperature reconstructed from the historical documents and sunspot activity index over the past 1400 years. Critical periodicities of similar to 450 and similar to 250 years show that solar activity is the dominant control on precipitation change on centennial scales. However, the relationship determined from Hm/Gt in this study contradicts the stalagmite delta O-18 interpretations from different regions of China, which exhibit a more complex precipitation pattern that is influenced by the strength of westerly jet in addition to the Asian monsoon. The increased westerly jet during the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) caused a humid climate in southern China and dry conditions in northern and western China.					; Zhang, Tingwei/AAK-7302-2020; Toney, Jaime/I-5083-2012	Zhang, Tingwei/0000-0002-9839-4559; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2020	30	2					289	299	0959683619883026	10.1177/0959683619883026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619883026		NOV 2019											WOS:000496079200001
J	Rayne, S; Forest, K				Rayne, Sierra; Forest, Kaya			Rapidly changing climatic conditions for wine grape growing in the Okanagan Valley region of British Columbia, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A statistical analysis was conducted on long-term climate records for sites bordering Okanagan Lake in the Okanagan Valley viticultural region of British Columbia, Canada. Average wine grape growing season temperatures are increasing rapidly in the area over the post-1980 period at rates upwards of 7.0 +/- 1.3 degrees C/century. Similar increases in the average dormant season temperature are evident. These temperature changes are likely some of the most extreme observed among the world's wine producing areas during the past few decades. Growing degree day base 10 degrees C (GDD(10)) has increased by nearly 50% at some locations since the 1970s, resulting in major impacts on the corresponding climate classification for viticulture. If current climate trends continue, the southern and central portions of the region will likely enter Winkler region II within the next few decades, placing them in the same category as well-established warmer wine regions from France, Spain, Italy, and Australia. The large dormant season temperature increases over the last several decades have resulted in the area no longer being a cold season outlier when compared to most other cool-climate viticultural areas. Based on average growing season temperatures, the southern end of Okanagan Lake has moved out of the cool-climate viticultural classification and into the intermediate zone, while the central and northern regions are now at the cool/intermediate viticulture interface, similar to the historical positions of the Rhine Valley in Germany, northern Oregon in the United States, and the Loire Valley, Burgundy-Cote, Burgundy-Beaujolais, and Champagne appelations of France. The corresponding suitable grape species for the area have evolved into warmer region varietals during this time frame, having substantial economic impacts on producers. Increased temperatures are also expected to bring greater threats from agricultural pests, notably Pierce's disease from the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We isolated F. psychrophilum from various samples collected from the lower basin of a river flowing into Lake Biwa, as a model for bacterial survey, in Shiga Prefecture in June, September, and December from 2010 to 2013 and investigated their gyrA genotypes. All three types of F. psychrophilum were isolated in June when ayu went up the river from the lake. In September, ayu gathered in the lower river basin for spawning and became high in density, almost all of the isolates were of the G-C genotype and the A-T genotype was never isolated. In December, only the A-T type was isolated from the river samples, when Biwa trout Oncorhynchus masou rhodurus came to the river to spawn and were present in the sampling area. In accordance with the seasonal change of the host fish species in the river, the genotype of F. psychrophilum isolated from the environment seems to have changed as well.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				NOV	2019	85	6					913	923		10.1007/s12562-019-01355-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-019-01355-7													WOS:000496954700004

Effects of cladoceran-conditioned medium on the demography of brachionid rotifers (Rotifera: Brachionidae)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					15th International Rotifer Symposium (IRS)	JUN 03-09, 2018	Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX	Univ Texas El Paso, Coll Sci, Border Biomed Res Ctr, Off Res & Sponsored Projects, Dodson Funds	Univ Texas El Paso			Rotifers and cladocerans compete for resources in freshwater ecosystems. Cladocerans, due to their large size, are competitively superior to rotifers. Cladocerans also release secondary metabolites into the medium which may be allelopathic to rotifers. However, in many eutrophic water bodies, rotifers are competitively dominant to cladocerans. We therefore hypothesize that allelochemicals released by competing species of Cladocera have weak or no adverse effects on rotifers. To test this, we conducted cohort life table demography experiments of the three rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus, Brachionus havanaensis, and Plationus patulus with cladoceran-conditioned medium (CM) derived from Moina macrocopa, Ceriodaphnia dubia, and Daphnia pulex. All six zooplankton species were isolated at the same time from a shallow eutrophic water body in Central Mexico. We found that the following demographic variables of B. calyciflorus cultured in CM did not differ from controls: life expectancy at birth, gross and net reproductive rates, generation time and the rate of population increase. We further showed that B. havanaensis was most sensitive to the cladoceran-mediated chemicals and that M. macrocopa-CM caused varied demographic responses in rotifers. We conclude that cladoceran-conditioned medium had weak allelopathic effects on rotifers unlike the negative experience from direct physical contact with Cladocera.

Here, we assessed the species richness S and taxonomic distinctness Delta+ (used a proxy of phylogenetic diversity) of crustacean zooplankton assemblages from 40 ponds and small lakes located in Albania and North Macedonia and tested whether they could be predicted by waterbodies' landscape characteristics (area, perimeter, and altitude), together with local bioclimatic conditions that were derived from Wordclim and MODIS databases. The results showed that a minimum adequate model, including the positive effects of non-arboreal vegetation cover and temperature seasonality, together with the negative influence of the mean temperature of the wettest quarter, effectively predicted assemblages' variation in species richness. In contrast, taxonomic distinctness did not predictably respond to landscape or bioclimatic factors. Noticeably, waterbodies' area showed a generally low prediction power for both S and Delta+. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of assemblages' species composition indicated the occurrence of two distinct groups of waterbodies characterized by different species and different precipitation and temperature regimes. Our findings indicated that the classical species-area relationship hypothesis is inadequate in explaining the diversity of crustacean zooplankton assemblages characterizing the waterbodies under analysis. In contrast, local bioclimatic factors might affect the species richness and composition, but not their phylogenetic diversity, the latter likely to be influenced by long-term adaptation mechanisms.

J	Rühland, K; Smol, JP				Rühland, K; Smol, JP			Diatom shifts as evidence for recent Subarctic warming in a remote tundra lake, NWT, Canada	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Changes in diatom assemblage composition were examined from the sediments of Slipper Lake, an isolated tundra lake located similar to 50 km north of current treeline in Canada's Northwest Territories. Diatom shifts over the last ca. 5600 years were related to the response of this ecosystem to climatic and environmental change during the late Holocene, with particular emphasis on the last few hundred years. To date, a detailed diatom analysis for this recent time frame has not been undertaken for the central Canadian Subarctic. The first ca. 5400 years of the sediment record was marked by modest shifts between benthic, alkaliphilous diatom taxa (e.g., Fragilaria, Achnanthes, and Navicula species) and heavily silicified, tychoplanktonic Aulacoseira species. In the 19th century, abrupt changes were delineated by a marked shift to a diatom assemblage characteristic of more planktonic habitats consisting of the Cyclotella stelligera complex (C. stelligera, C. pseudostelligera), which was absent in earlier sediments. Several possible mechanisms for these recent changes are examined, including atmospheric deposition of acidifying compounds and anthropogenically derived nutrient enrichment, however we conclude that climatically induced limnological changes associated with shorter duration of ice cover and a longer growing season can best explain the direction and magnitude of changes in our diatom record.

At present, nearly half of the total population inhabits Poyang Lake. The hydrological seasonality of the lake significantly influences porpoise habitat configuration, which brings problems for conservation in the delineation of reserve design and the management of human activities. A hydrodynamic model was used to distinguish the different hydrological conditions between the flood and dry seasons. The MaxEnt model was used to investigate the major environmental variables affecting porpoise distribution and delineate likely habitats of the porpoise under different hydrological conditions. The effectiveness of the present nature reserve was evaluated based on these results. Flow velocity and distance to fish spawning grounds were the primary variables influencing porpoise distribution during the dry season. Water depth, flow velocity and the distance to bank were the major variables during the flood season. The likely habitats were distributed discontinuously along the main channel during the dry season, with a total area of 112 km(2). During the flood season, the habitats extended into the central areas of the lake and tributaries with a total area of 628 km(2). At present, the nature reserve covers 4% and 18% of the likely core habitats during dry and flood seasons. An ideal nature reserve should be designed as an integrative network with reference to the seasonality of likely habitat distribution and major environmental variables. The habitats in conditions of extreme low water should be strictly protected in the dry season. Enhanced survey efforts, long-term hydrodynamic modelling and species distribution modelling can greatly assist in understanding habitat configuration and changing processes for other freshwater cetaceans inhabiting river-lake systems. Future planning to improve protection should consider habitat characteristics under the shifting hydrological conditions caused by climate change or artificial flow alteration.

A total of 168 YFPs were sampled, 68 living in the semi-natural (Tian-E-Zhou Oxbow) and 98 living in the wild (Poyang Lake, PL) environment. The YFPs in the Tian-E-Zhou Oxbow were sampled from 2002 to 2015 and in the PL from 2009 to 2017. Each population was divided into Juvenile Male, Juvenile Female, Adult Male, Pregnant and Lactating Female life history categories. Overall, with location, 19/33 of the analytes and with season 18/33 of the analytes were significantly different. Similarly, within each location, 15/33 of the analytes changed with time in PL while only 8/33 changed with time in Tian-E-Zhou Oxbow, respectively. Finally, 15/33 of the analytes demonstrated significant differences between the different age and sex groups of animals. In our study, a significant variation, as well as an increasing and decreasing pattern of several parameters in both populations, suggest a worsening ecological environment of both habitats. This study will help in health assessment, improving conservation and management practices, a crucial requisite for biodiversity conservation.

The environments of the trackway-bearing beds have been investigated using sedimentological, palaeontological, geochemical and palaeomagnetic methods. The reconstructed tetrapod habitats comprised shallow-water lagoons separated from an open marine basin by sparsely vegetated islands and spits. The lagoonal waters were well-aerated and a few metres deep at most, undergoing periodic desiccation. The dolomitic sediments, primarily of microbial origin, formed in tropical waters of slightly modified marine composition. Oxygen isotope data obtained from the dolomicrites suggest water temperatures around 30 degrees C. The seasonal semi-arid to sub-humid climate, deduced from paleosol characteristics, was probably of a tropical monsoonal type. The degree of restriction of the lagoonal system evolved from relatively open, evaporation-dominated towards increasingly closed, freshwater influenced. The detailed observations of the footprint-bearing beds, as well as the characteristics of the tracks, indicate that they were formed mostly under subaqueous conditions, by wading, walking on the bottom or swimming animals. Lack of tidal indicators in the restricted Zachelmie lagoons argues against previous concept that tidal flats served as a food source for the early tetrapods. Nor is a hypothesis of flooded woodlands confirmed as a habitat promoting the "fish-to-tetrapod" transition. We propose that functional limbs emerged among aqueous animals that acquired their locomotional capabilities in a shallow lagoonal water before attempting longer excursions on land.

In temporary water bodies, seasonal progression can be rapid. The community response of aquatic littoral invertebrate communities to disturbance was measured across four temporary water bodies (turloughs) representing a hydroperiod gradient in the karst landscape of western Ireland. Three distinct turlough wet-phases were identified based on macroinvertebrate taxon richness and community composition: filling, aquatic and drying phase. Invertebrates able to recolonise the turlough environment quickly upon flooding from refugia (e.g. sink-holes or little puddles) or resting stages within the turlough basin demonstrated highest proportion in abundances during the initial filling phase. Over time, the number of actively dispersing invertebrates, generally occupying turloughs only for a part of their life-cycle, increased. Hydroperiod had a significant effect on macroinvertebrate taxon richness, with short hydroperiods supporting low faunal diversity. Influence of hydrological disturbance generally decreased with progression of the annual wet phase, indicated by a decrease in taxon richness variation and an increase of biodiversity with time. Our study highlights the importance of life-cycle strategies of species for the occurrence of fairly predictable and periodically occurring seasonal patterns, and emphasizes the importance of ecological disturbances for colonisation cycles.

Middle Miocene to Pleistocene sedimentary record of rift evolution in the southern Albert Rift (Uganda)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												This study presents an almost complete Middle Miocene to Pleistocene sequence of synrift sediments in the western branch of the East African Rift. The studied succession is exposed in several patches on an eastward tilted block between the northern tip of the Rwenzori Block and the eastern shoulder of the Albert Rift. In this position, it reaches a maximum thickness of 600 m of which 350 m have been logged systematically by analysing lithofacies and sediment architecture. Stratigraphic subdivision of the succession relies on published biostratigraphic data of endemic mollusc associations and their correlation across East Africa. The synrift sediments encountered are siliciclastics ranging from clay to coarse gravel with gypsum and ferrugineous interlayers or impregnations. Lithofacies and architectural analysis indicate alluvial plain, delta plain, nearshore, delta front, or lacustrine depositional environments. Based on the vertical stacking pattern, prograding and retrograding trends of the depositional environments, and climatic indicators (e.g. conservation of feldspar, gypsum, and/or iron hydroxide precipitation), four evolutionary phases can be distinguished: (i) a first phase between ca. 14.5 and 10.0 Ma is characterised by bedload-dominated fluvial environment with massive sandy to gravelly bedforms, feldspar-rich sands, rare iron impregnations and relatively low accommodation space. This phase is interpreted as pre- and early synrift sedimentation under a semiarid climate. (ii) From ca. 10.0 to 4.5 Ma predominantly fine-grained siliciclastics were deposited in a distal fluvial plain to lacustrine setting characterised by limited accommodation space. Fluctuation of thin beds, dominance of clay and frequent iron impregnations point to a more humid climate with seasonality and weak tectonic activity. (iii) During the third phase between 4.5 and 2.0 Ma delta plain and nearshore deposits with frequent ferrugineous impregnations and rich mollusc associations occurred, indicating a humid period with lake-level highstands and accelerated subsidence. (iv) During the final sedimentary interval between 2.0 and 1.5 Ma gravel units reoccurred with less iron- but more carbonate and gypsum impregnations, and arkosic sandstones. This phase recorded a general aridisation trend most probably caused by the upcoming rain barrier of the Rwenzori Mountains together with accelerated rift-flank uplift and strong subsidence of the rift floor. The results of this study are of particular importance for delineating key controls on sedimentation in the Albert Rift.

J	Bolson, J; Broad, K				Bolson, Jessica; Broad, Kenneth			Early Adoption of Climate Information: Lessons Learned from South Florida Water Resource Management	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY												Seasonal climate forecasting skill has improved over the past decades, accompanied by expectations that these forecasts, along with other climate information, will be increasingly used by water managers in certain regions of the United States. Most research efforts focus on why adoption does not occur; however, the important question of why adoption does occur has received little attention. Barriers to the use of climate information by this sector frequently identified include risk aversion, institutional constraints, and low forecast reliability. Relatively fewer researchers have focused on the identification and analysis of cases of adoption of climate information in the water management sector. Relying upon the results from observations and semistructured interviews conducted between 2006 and 2010 in South Florida, this research identifies the characteristics that enabled the early adoption of climate information by the South Florida Water Management District, one of the largest water management organizations in the United States. The findings herein are analyzed in relation to existing theories on technology transfer and innovation diffusion. Lessons from this specific case are situated in the context of the broader U.S. water management landscape. The research finds that the existence of in-house climate expertise, innovative agency culture, social networks linking water and climate science researchers, and serendipitous policy windows were critical factors enabling adoption. Additionally, models and information, including a long-range hydrologic model and a national government-issued seasonal climate forecast were readily available and could be incorporated into preexisting and trusted decision-support tools. Implications for climate services in the U.S. water sector are discussed.

Recently, the paleo-environment deposition factors of the P1f formation have become a popular research topic. This research was conducted using data from the F7 well of Mahu Sag, based on the geochemical analysis results of TOC (total organic carbon), REE (rare earth elements), and major and trace elements of 53 samples from P1f (Lower Permian Fengcheng formation), and some deposition factors are discussed. The P1f deposition process was classified into four stages based on paleo-environment elemental indicators. This research describes the deposition process of the evolution of alkaline lakes. The early and preliminary stages of alkali lake evolution are considered as late P1f1 to middle P1f2; the paleoclimate of this process was dry, the reduction conditions increased, and the paleo-productivity and lake salinity were enhanced. The terminal stage of alkali lake evolution is considered as late P1f2 to middle P1f3; in this period, the paleoclimate changed with seasonal cycles, resulting in a decrease in water salinity and an increase in oxidation; the paleo-productivity of the alkaline lake was at a medium level. Until the end of P1f3, the salinity of the lake decreased, and the water body became anoxic and weakly alkaline. Furthermore, the research on TOC and sedimentary parameters confirmed that the deposition of P1f organic matter is affected by multiple types of factors. A relatively warm climate, lack of oxygen, fresh water-brackish water, suitable debris flow, and high primary productivity conditions promoted organic matter deposition.																				2227-9717				AUG	2023	11	8							2483	10.3390/pr11082483	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr11082483													WOS:001057434800001

ASSESSING THE USE OF MULTISEASON QUICKBIRD IMAGERY FOR MAPPING INVASIVE SPECIES IN A LAKE ERIE COASTAL MARSH	WETLANDS												QuickBird multispectral satellite images taken in September 2002 (peak biomass) and April 2003 (pre-growing season) were used to map emergent wetland vegetation communities, particularly invasive Phragmites australis and Typha spp., within a diked wetland at the western end of Lake Eric. An unsupervised classification was performed on a nine-layer image stack consisting of all four spectral bands from both dates plus a September Normalized Difference Vegetation Index image. The resulting eight cover classes distinguished three monodominant genera (Phragmites australis, Typha spp.. Nelumbo lutea), three multigenera plant communities (wet meadow, other non persistent emergents. woody vegetation), and two unvegetated cover types (water, bare soil). Field validation at 196 data points yielded an overall classification accuracy of 62%, with producer's accuracy for the eight individual classes ranging from 41 to 91% and user's accuracy from 17 to 90%. Three-fourths of areas designated as Phragmites were correctly mapped, but 14% Were found to be cattail (Typha) during Field validation. Lotus (Nelumbo lutea) beds were accurately mapped on multiseason imagery (producer's accuracy = 91%); these beds had not yet emerged above water in April, but were full), developed in September. Other types of non persistent vegetation were confused with managed areas in which vegetation had been Cut and burned to control invasive Phragmites. Multiseason QuickBird imagery is promising for distinguishing certain wetland plant species, but Should be used with caution in highly managed areas where vegetation changes may reflect human alterations rather than phenological change.

Here, the climate-air quality-hydrological cycle affecting sulfate aerosols remains sparsely investigated, with their source origin(s) requiring further investigation. We tracked the evolution of sulfur mass-independent isotope fractionation [S-MIF i.e., Delta S-33 not equal 0]-as a potential source tracer-in springtime aerosol sulfate over the southern HTP. In a first, at the southern HTP high-altitude receptor site Qomolangma-Mt. Everest station, QOMS, similar to 4300 m a.s.l., elevated sulfate concentrations and S-MIF were both found to be associated with biomass burning aerosols (SO42- and Delta S-33 vs. K+: R-2 = 0.92 [P < 0.001] and 0.61[P < 0.005], respectively). This is in stark contrast to Delta S-33 aerosol records from the central HTP and a downwind mountainous site wherein anomalous sulfur has been linked to stratospheric intrusions in the past, and geological lake records from the region which link the origin of modern sulfate on the HTP to the influx of mineral dust, respectively. The findings suggest that there are yet unknown biomass combustion-related processes (e.g., crop-residue and waste burning, wildfires) plausibly generating positive MIF in sulfur, which could have implications for historical S-isotope records. Comparing the triple-S-isotope imprint in aerosol sulfate on the HTP and its surrounding regions reveals the existence of spatial heterogeneity in the dominance of competing sulfate transport and formation processes with implications for the regional tropospheric chemical and radiation budgets.					; Paris, Guillaume/ABA-3266-2020; Widory, David/AAF-5699-2021	Paris, Guillaume/0000-0001-8368-1224; DASARI, SANJEEV/0000-0001-7222-7982; Widory, David/0000-0003-0405-8819														2754-7000				JUL 31	2023	2	8					1110	1118		10.1039/d3va00085k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d3va00085k													WOS:001109208700001

Quantifying Predation on Galaxiids and Other Native Organisms by Introduced Rainbow Trout in an Ultraoligotrophic Lake in Northern Patagonia, Argentina: a Bioenergetics Modeling Approach	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Exotic rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss support an economically valuable recreational fishery in Patagonia but also create concern for impacts on native organisms. These concerns are intensified by the possibility of hatchery release programs in this region. We estimated losses of different prey from predation by rainbow trout in Lake Moreno, Rio Negro Province, Argentina, using a bioenergetics model combined with input data from directed sampling on growth, seasonal diet, distribution, and thermal experience. The fish community was sampled seasonally using gill nets, hydroacoustics, and ichthyoplankton nets. Pelagic galaxiid larvae and benthic juvenile and adult small puyen Galaxias maculatus were the most important components of the diet. Bioenergetics simulations showed that over a 6-year life span in the lake (ages 1-7), rainbow trout attained a body mass of 2.3 kg and consumed 74.7 kg of food, of which 20% consisted of galaxiid larvae and 16% consisted of adult small puyen. Based on an estimated abundance of 29,000 rainbow trout of ages 1-7, this predator exerted significant but sustainable mortality on the native prey populations, consuming 44 metric tons or an estimated 23% of the annual larval galaxiid production and 35 metric tons of adult small puyen, which represented an unknown fraction of the postlarval population. Galaxiids supported the estimated predation demand under current conditions. However, simulations of stocking strategies normally proposed for this region showed that consumption demands on prey would increase to unsustainable levels, reducing native fish populations and likely reducing growth of rainbow trout. It is also probable that the fish community composition would shift further in response to the increased demand for prey by stocked predators. This implies that in some cases, stocking could jeopardize sport fisheries; stocking strategies should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to be consistent with specific objectives for native fish conservation and sustainable food web interactions.					; ALONSO, MARCELO/AAY-2437-2021	Barriga, Juan Pablo/0000-0003-1646-4785; Milano, Daniela/0000-0002-0542-5863; Ciancio, Javier/0000-0003-1674-842X; Rechencq, Magali/0000-0002-1190-7279; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2009	138	6					1405	1419		10.1577/T08-067.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T08-067.1													WOS:000277124500016

Based on the laboratory experiment and field investigation, the flow-disturbance parameter ' was presented to improve the algae growth formula. By numerical simulation, the algae growth processes in a river-lake system were simulated, and the temporal and spatial distributions of Chl-a concentration in the area were analysed. Our results show the following: (1) Hydrodynamic conditions play an apparent effect on algae growth. A suitable turbulence is more beneficial for algal proliferation than the static or intense mixing. (2) In the studied area, the flow disturbances in the east-west rivers are generally stronger than that in the north-south rivers, while the Chl-a concentration is oppositely distributed in the river networks. (3) As a result of the different flow disturbance intensities during periods, the algae cell density in all investigated sections also alters evidently along with the seasons. The average Chl-a concentration in the dry seasons (November-April) increased by 9.22% than that in the flood seasons (May-October). (4) From the point of the whole river-lake system, the dynamic conditions in the lake inlet areas are more suitable for algae growth than that in the river networks. The Chl-a concentrations of S2 and S4 are averagely increased by 18.5% than that in the river networks. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Diurnal and seasonal variations of pCO2 and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in different polluted lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												This study aimed to assess pollution and daily-to-seasonal dynamics of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CO2 degassing flux concerning the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) from tropical lakes. A membrane-enclosed pCO(2) sensor and water quality multimeter analyzer was deployed to continuously record daily and seasonal variations in pCO(2) and CO2 degassing flux in three lakes in Savar, Dhaka. During both wet and dry seasons, all lake water was supersaturated with CO2 in contrast to the atmospheric equilibrium (similar to 400 mu atm). The pCO(2) values in the lake water during the dry season were relatively low in comparison, and the pCO(2) levels in the wet season were much higher due to external inputs of organic matter from watersheds and direct inputs of CO2 from soils or wetlands. The estimated water-to-air CO2 degassing flux in the different levels of polluted lakes varies with the pollution context. Study areas calculated the carbon flux and three lakes released respectively 86.75x10(7)g CO2 year(-1), 13.8x10(7)g CO2 year(-1), and 9.17x10(7)g CO2 year(-1). Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis was used to investigate the distributions of fluorescent components in DOM. EEM-PARAFAC analysis identified humic-like, fulvic-like, protein-like, and more tyrosine-like FDOM components and their environmental dynamics. Terrestrial DOM may provide inputs to the terrestrial humic-like component in the lake water. In contrast, the biological activity of plankton-derived FDOM is the most likely source for the autochthonous humic-like component.

J	Sun, TJ; Zhu, QY; Wang, ZZ				Sun, Tongjing; Zhu, Qingyu; Wang, Zhizhuan			Improved Extended Kalman Filter Tracking Method Based On Active Waveguide Invariant Distribution	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY												Objective The complex and variable nature of the underwater environment presents significant challenges for the field of underwater target tracking. Factors such as environmental noise, interference, and reverberation can severely distort and obscure the signals emitted or reflected by underwater targets, complicating accurate detection and tracking efforts. Additionally, advancements in weak target signal technology add further complexity, as they necessitate sophisticated methods to enhance and interpret signals that may be lost amidst background noise. The challenges associated with underwater target tracking are multifaceted. One major issue is the interference that can compromise the integrity and reliability of target information. Another critical challenge lies in the difficulty of extracting useful feature information from the often chaotic underwater environment. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on basic signal processing techniques, frequently fall short in addressing these complexities. Underwater tracking technology serves as a cornerstone in several key fields, including marine science, military strategy, and marine resource development. Notably, effective underwater tracking is essential for monitoring, sonar detection, and the deployment of underwater weapons within the military sector. Considering the significance of underwater tracking technology, there is an urgent need for innovative methods to address the existing challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified approach that views the target and environment as an integrated system, extracting coupled features- specifically, active waveguide invariants-and fusing these features into the motion model to enhance underwater tracking capabilities. Methods: This paper presents an enhanced extended Kalman filter tracking method, which is built upon the active waveguide invariant distribution. The mathematical model for active waveguide invariant representation is derived based on the foundational theory of target scattering characteristics in shallow water waveguides, with specific consideration of transmitter-receiver separation. This derivation establishes the constraint relationships among distance, frequency, and the active waveguide invariant distribution. These constraints are subsequently incorporated into the state vector of the extended Kalman filter to enhance the alignment between the target motion model and the actual trajectory, thereby improving tracking accuracy. The method includes image preprocessing steps such as filtering, edge detection, and edge smoothing, followed by the application of the Radon transform to extract essential parameters, including distance and frequency. The Radon transform is refined using threshold filtering to improve parameter extraction. The active waveguide invariant distribution is then computed, and the tracking performance of the method is validated through simulation experiments and real measurement data. The simulation setup involves a rigid ball as the target in a shallow water environment, modeled using a constant velocity assumption. Real measurement data is collected under similar conditions at the Xin'An River experimental site. For both simulations and real measurements, a steel ball model target and constant velocity model are employed, with equipment deployed on the same horizontal plane. Results and Discussions: First, the distribution of the constant of propagation within the active waveguide was obtained through simulation experiments. A comparison was made between the Invariant Distribution-Extended Kalman Filter (ID-EKF), the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and the Invariance Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF). In trajectory tracking, the ID-EKF demonstrated closer alignment to the true trajectory compared to both the EKF and IEKF. Additionally, in terms of the mean square error of the predicted posterior position, the ID-EKF exhibited a lower error rate. As indicated by the overall estimation accuracy, the ID-EKF achieved approximately 50% greater accuracy than the EKF and about 30% higher accuracy than the IEKF. Subsequently, the ID-EKF algorithm was validated in a real-world scenario using actual measurement data. The acoustic field interference stripes were obtained through the processing of received echo signals, and the distribution of the constant of propagation was extracted by manually selecting points and conducting a maximum search, followed by curve fitting using the joint edge curve fitting method. Results from Monte Carlo simulation experiments demonstrated a decreasing order of tracking accuracy for the ID-EKF, IEKF, and EKF, consistent with the simulation results. The overall estimation accuracy of the ID-EKF was approximately 60% higher than that of the EKF and about 40% superior to that of the IEKF. Conclusions: This paper presents a novel tracking method based on the extended Kalman filter, informed by the interference characteristics of target and environmental coupling in shallow water waveguides. The effectiveness of this method is substantiated through both theoretical simulation data and empirical lake measurement data. The active waveguide invariant distribution was derived using the Radon transform, which facilitated the implementation of the ID-EKF tracking. Results from both simulations and experiments reveal that the extracted active invariant value distribution manifests in two scenarios: either coinciding with 1 or exhibiting significant deviation from 1. When the extracted invariant value is markedly different from 1, the ID-EKF demonstrates a reduced tracking error and a more pronounced convergence relative to other tracking algorithms, highlighting the importance of precisely extracting this value to enhance the ID-EKF's performance. Conversely, when the extracted value is close to 1, the tracking error of the ID-EKF aligns more closely with that of the IEKF algorithm. In both cases, it is evident that the extracted invariant value is pivotal in enhancing the accuracy of the tracking algorithm. Future research will prioritize the extraction of more accurate invariant values to facilitate the development of higher-precision tracking algorithms.

To investigate the dynamics of mercury newly deposited onto a terrestrial ecosystem, an enriched stable isotope of mercury (Hg-202) was sprayed onto a Boreal forest subcatchment in an experiment that allowed us, for the first time, to monitor the fate of "new" mercury in deposition and to distinguish it from native mercury historically stored in the ecosystem. Newly deposited mercury was more reactive than the native mercury with respect to volatilization and methylation pathways. Mobility through runoff was very low and strongly decreased with time because of a rapid equilibration with the large native pool of "bound" mercury. Over one season, only similar to8% of the added Hg-202 volatilized to the atmosphere and less than 1% appeared in runoff. Within a few months, approximately 66% of the applied Hg-202 remained associated with above ground vegetation, with the rest being incorporated into soils. The fraction of 202Hg bound to vegetation was much higher than seen for native Hg (<5% vegetation), suggesting that atmospherically derived mercury enters the soil pool with a time delay, after plants senesce and decompose. The initial mobility of mercury received through small rain events or dry deposition decreased markedly in a relatively short time period, suggesting that mercury levels in terrestrial runoff may respond slowly to changes in mercury deposition rates.					; St. Louis, Vincent/G-6842-2011; Hintelmann, Holger/AEV-0466-2022; Hurley, James/A-9216-2010; Heyes, Andrew/E-5269-2012	Rudd, John/0000-0002-4805-4337; Hintelmann, Holger/0000-0002-5287-483X; Kelly, Carol/0000-0003-2473-7560; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 1	2002	36	23					5034	5040		10.1021/es025572t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es025572t								12523417					WOS:000179685000018

Photochemical degradation of dissolved organic matter from streams in the western Lake Superior watershed	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The input and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) can have important consequences for coastal zone productivity in large lakes and oceans. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM) is often delivered to coastal zones from rivers and streams and affects light penetration in a water column. CDOM can protect biota from damaging ultraviolet (UV) light by acting as sunscreen, resulting in increased ecosystem productivity. Alternatively, CDOM can decrease ecosystem productivity by absorbing light needed for photosynthesis and forming photoreaction products that are harmful to coastal zone biota. Increased urbanization of watersheds and seasonal differences in weather patterns change the delivery pathways, reactivity, input, and energy flow of DOM (and its CDOM component) into aquatic systems. This study investigated the effects of watershed and season on the concentrations and potential photodegradation of stream-derived DOM in Lake Superior tributaries, chosen to be geographically and geologically similar but differing in land use. Organic carbon analysis, UV-Visible spectrophotometry, and terrestrial (land use) analysis were used to investigate differences among samples and sample treatments. The major differences in DOM concentration and photochemical response appeared seasonal rather than site specific, with snow-melt samples showing stronger and more consistent changes in UV-Visible parameters while base-flow samples showed stronger and more consistent losses in DOC.

J	Pimentel, JSM; Giani, A				Pimentel, Juliana S. M.; Giani, Alessandra			Estimating toxic cyanobacteria in a Brazilian reservoir by quantitative real-time PCR, based on the microcystin synthetase D gene	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												The production of microcystin toxins by cyanobacteria is an intrapopulation feature and the toxic and nontoxic genotypes can be separated only through molecular analyses targeting the mcy markers. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a procedure that has been established, not only to detect but to specifically quantify these genotypes. In the present work, primers were designed for the mcyD region to estimate the number of cyanobacteria that are potential microcystin producers. Laboratory tests to verify the efficiency and the specificity of the primers were performed. The methodology was first established for single strain cultures and thereafter was applied in environmental water samples, from a reservoir located in the Brazilian savannah ("cerrado"). The results were very satisfactory, demonstrating the high efficiency and the specificity of the primers used, and their ability to detect different cyanobacteria genera. Of particular interest were the results showing a high proportion of toxic strains (as high as 100 %) in the environmental samples, as previously reported in another tropical system. Furthermore, the occurrence of a smaller fraction of toxic strains at high cyanobacteria densities, and of more toxic populations when fewer cyanobacteria were present, deserves further investigation. Although records of cyanobacteria blooms are very common in the tropics and suggest an increasing incidence of toxic populations, the present research is one of the few applying qPCR in a tropical environment. The results obtained here, by a technique that allows a more precise quantification and in situ follow-up of changes in toxicity, will make possible new observations of seasonal and spatial dynamics in these environments.

ALNs are pleomorphic, with three dominant morphotypes which do not fit into any previously defined environmental entities [i.e., ultramicro-prokaryotes, controversed nanobes, and non-living particles (biomimetic mineralo-organic particles, natural nanoparticles or viruses)] of similar size. Elemental composition and selected-area electron diffraction patterns suggested that the organic nature of ALNs may prevail over the possibility of crystal structures. Likewise, recorded changes in ALN numbers in the absence of cells are at odds with an affiliation to until now described viral particles. ALN abundances showed marked seasonal dynamics in the lakewater, with maximal values (up to 9.0 +/- 0.5 x 10(7) particles.mL(-1)) reaching eight times those obtained for prokaryotes, and representing up to about 40% of the abundances of virus-like particles. We conclude that (i) aquatic ecosystems are reservoirs of novel, abundant, and dynamic aster-like nanoparticles, (ii) not all virus-like particles observed in aquatic systems are necessarily viruses, and (iii) there may be several types of other ultra-small particles in natural waters that are currently unknown but potentially ecologically important.

Late Quaternary paleoenvironmental changes in tropical eastern Africa revealed by multi-proxy records from the Cherangani Hills, Kenya	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												There is paucity in the proxy records available for the reconstruction of vegetation and climate histories of tropical eastern Africa, especially north of the equator. Here, we present a new paleoenvironmental record based on a 3.5-m sediment core from the Kapkanyar mire, Cherangani Hills, Kenya. Using analyses of pollen, microscopic charcoal, and loss-on-ignition data, we examine the vegetation and climate history of tropical eastern Africa over the past similar to 23 Kyrs. Our findings show that high levels of dry montane forest vegetation and high frequencies of Poaceae and Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (Cheno/Am) pollen types dominate the LGM period (similar to 23.5-18 Kyrs). The last deglaciation (similar to 18-12 Kyrs) is marked by a decrease in Afromontane vegetation such as Ulmaceae, Combretaceae, and Podocarpus and resurgence in Cheno/Am pollen with a minimal representation of Olen pollen. The presence of Combretaceae pollen alongside increased percentages of Cheno/Am pollen indicates that cold and dry climate likely prevailed during the last deglaciation period. The record shows that the eastern African region was generally wet over most of the Holocene, albeit with increased frequency of drought episodes. The first imprints of anthropogenic activities in the record appear between similar to 4 and 3.5 Kyrs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These fishes have colonised several freshwater ecosystems in Europe, as well as in North America. As knowledge on their habitat utilisation in their native range remains limited, the seasonal habitat uses of Western tubenose goby, Proterorhinus semilunaris and monkey goby Neogobius fluviatilis were studied in four natural lakes in the Marmara Region (NW Turkey). Habitat use of both species was highly variable between the lakes and seasons, with P. semilunaris showing higher plasticity. In general, the main habitats used by P. semilunaris were shallow waters in littoral areas that had vegetation cover, whereas N. fluviatilis consistently used sandy substratum in deeper waters that lacked vegetation. These results suggested there was high plasticity in the habitat utilisation of these two gobiids, especially in P. semilunaris, which potentially facilitates their ability to establish and invade novel environments. The habitats that are especially vulnerable to P. semilunaris invasion are medium size substrates which provide individuals with sufficient interstitial space for refuge. Waters providing differing habitats, such as sandy substrata, might inhibit their colonisation, but are potentially more vulnerable to N. fluviatilis invasion.

Distributed and dynamic modelling of hydrology, phosphorus and ecology in the Hampshire Avon and Blashford Lakes: Evaluating alternative strategies to meet WFD standards	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The issues of diffuse and point source phosphorus (P) pollution in the Hampshire Avon and Blashford Lakes are explored using a catchment model of the river system. A multibranch, process based, dynamic water quality model (INCA-P) has been applied to the whole river system to simulate water fluxes, total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations and ecology. The model has been used to assess impacts of both agricultural runoff and point sources from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) on water quality. The results show that agriculture contributes approximately 40% of the phosphorus load and point sources the other 60% of the load in this catchment. A set of scenarios have been investigated to assess the impacts of alternative phosphorus reduction strategies and it is shown that a combined strategy of agricultural phosphorus reduction through either fertiliser reductions or better phosphorus management together with improved treatment at WWTPs would reduce the SRP concentrations in the river to acceptable levels to meet the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements. A seasonal strategy for WVVTP phosphorus reductions would achieve significant benefits at reduced cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Fish were sampled on seasonal basis, and superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase activities and levels of glutathione and malondialdehyde in gills were determined. Significant variations of oxidative stress biomarkers were observed between seasons and sites. The results of this study show that seasonal variations of oxidative stress responses and lipid peroxidation in gills of C. umbla are sensitive to the contaminants present in water of Uzuncayir Dam Lake and selected parameters are in valuable biomarkers for monitoring of water systems, since they give an early warning signal of effects of xenobiotics on aquatic organisms at molecular levels which help to prevent their effects at organismal level.

Phytoplankton community relationship to environmental variables in three Kenyan Rift Valley saline-alkaline lakes	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Temporal changes in total alkalinity, ionic composition and nutrient concentrations were studied in the saline, alkaline endorheic Kenyan Rift Valley Lakes Bogoria, Nakuru and Elmentaita to understand the association of these variables with phytoplankton community structure. In total, 24 taxa were found, with L. Bogoria having the fewest species. Although the cyanobacterium Arthrospira fusiformis dominated the phytoplankton biomass, especially in L. Bogoria, other groups came into play especially during high water levels in L. Nakuru and L. Elmentaita. Cluster analysis based on species biomass resulted in four groups, characterised by 13 indicator taxa. Most of the variation in these groups appeared to be associated with hydrological stability and perhaps biological factors rather than water chemistry, which only explained 44% of the variance in taxa composition on the first four axes derived from redundancy analysis. Species numbers decreased with elevated conductivity and water temperature. Synechocystis sp. occurrence coincided with phosphorus, water temperature and conductivity increase, whereas the distributions of Arthrospira fusiformis and Arthrospira platensis were mainly influenced by both light attenuation and elevated nitrate concentrations. Increases in silica and ammonium and declines in conductivity, total phosphorus and water temperature enhanced diatom abundances. Not only do the results of the present study indicate the unexpectedly high variability of phytoplankton community composition and water chemistry in these three alkaline tropical lakes, but also the data assist our understanding of the factors influencing flamingo populations on these lakes, which are significant conservation reserves and tourist attractions.

To study factors that contribute to microbial community assembly, we examined the temporal dynamics of genes in five aquatic metagenome time-series, originating from marine offshore or coastal sites and one lake. With this trait-based approach we expected to find gene-specific patterns of temporal allele variability that depended on the seasonal metacommunity size of carrier-taxa and the variability of the milieu and the substrates to which the resulting proteins were exposed. In more detail, we hypothesized that a larger seasonal metacommunity size would result in increased temporal variability of functional units (i.e., gene alleles), as shown previously for taxonomic units. We further hypothesized that multicopy genes would feature higher temporal variability than single-copy genes, as gene multiplication can result from high variability in substrate quality and quantity. Finally, we hypothesized that direct exposure of proteins to the extracellular environment would result in increased temporal variability of the respective gene compared to intracellular proteins that are less exposed to environmental fluctuations. The first two hypotheses were confirmed in all data sets, while significant effects of the subcellular location of gene products was only seen in three of the five time-series. The gene with the highest allele variability throughout all data sets was an iron transporter, also representing a target for phage infection. Previous work has emphasized the role of phage-prokaryote interactions as a major driver of microbial diversity.

By designing a laboratory experiment simulating historical water levels of low, normal and high wetland plant submersion, this study aimed to elucidate the effects of different levels of flooding on growth and antioxidant enzyme activity for V. spiralis. The results showed that the plant crown light intensity of the treated group and control group (CG) first decreased and then increased along with the seasonal variation of the water level. The maximum and minimum values of the plant crown light intensity were observed in April and July, respectively. Similar to the CG, V. spiralis from the normal and low water level (LWL) groups was measured and had higher plant height growth in the flooding period from May to June, and the entire plant biomass also showed a steady growth trend in the same period. However, the plant growth of the high water level (LWL) group was lower during the whole simulation period, with negative growth in July. Antioxidant enzyme activities changed with the seasonal temperature, and the activity of the CC showed a rising trend. Compared with those of the CC, the antioxidant enzyme activities of the HWL group showed a 'bell shaped' trend, which was first significantly induced and then significantly inhibited. In addition, the peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities from the LWL group in April were also significantly induced. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) index showed that a comprehensive biological index could well reflect the effects of seasonal water levels in Poyang Lake on the growth of the wetland plant V. spiralis. This study indicated that high flooding levels had the strongest negative effect on the growth and enzyme activity of the submerged plant V. spiralis.					张, 洁/GXZ-7743-2022; Zhang, Yan/K-2043-2012; zhang, Shifeng/HPH-0217-2023	JI, YONG/0000-0002-4604-4258; 													2054-5703					DEC	2018	5	12							180729	10.1098/rsos.180729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.180729								30662717					WOS:000456566500006

The straight indurated linear dunes are elongated downwind of dome dunes and barchans under a unimodal wind regime, providing a novel research opportunity for geomorphologists to investigate the coexistence of transverse and longitudinal dunes and the effect of sediment induration on dune morphology. The linear dunes around the Chaerhan salt lake in the Qaidam Basin are good analogs for the Chasma Boreale linear dunes because of the similarities in dune morphology and evolution process. Further, the effects of the indurating agents (salt and ice) on the formation of the linear dunes are similar in both locations. In this paper, we have contrasted and analyzed their dune patterns, the influence of cohesive sediment, and wind regimes in the two areas. The formation process and underlying mechanisms that create the linear dunes are analyzed through geomorphological evidence and dune flow simulation experiments. The results show that there is a remarkable morphological resemblance between the two areas. Cohesive sediments, especially the interbedded frozen laminae on Mars, increase dune stability, and thus allow the formation of linear dunes under a small divergence-angle in a bidirectional wind regime. The proto-linear dune facilitates the deposition of sediment along the major axis of the dune, and the lateral wind maintains and promotes the development of linear dunes. We also discuss how cohesive sediment influences dune morphology and leads to a transition from barchans to linear dunes, and we examine the feedback between dune form and airflow. The different effects of sediment induration on dune morphology make the determination of aeolian patterns less certain, which has implications for the development of climate models of Mars and Titan.

Seasonal timing of reproductive migrations in adfluvial bull trout: an assessment of sex, spawning experience, population density, and environmental factors	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Using individual tags combined with a fish fence operated at the mouth of Smith-Dorrien Creek, the primary spawning habitat for Lower Kananaskis Lake bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), we approximated a complete census of the spawning population from 1996 to 2000 to assess whether timing of upstream and downstream spawning migrations varied with extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The timing of both upstream and downstream migrations varied with sex, previous spawning experience, density, and temperature. Inferred spawning duration based on the predicted upstream and downstream migration dates indicated that experienced female spawners spent the least amount of time upstream and first-time spawners spent the most time upstream. No consistent differences in upstream migration timing were observed between non-repetitive and repetitive spawners. We suggest that variations in spawning migration timing observed in Lower Kananaskis Lake may be linked to environmental factors that influence upstream swimming ability and acquisition and expenditure of energy with respect to reproduction.

Initial soil respiration response to biomass harvesting and green-tree retention in aspen-dominated forests of the Great Lakes region	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Contemporary forest management practices are increasingly designed to optimize novel objectives, such as maximizing biomass feedstocks and/or maintaining ecological legacies, but many uncertainties exist regarding how these practices influence forest carbon (C) cycling. We examined the responses of soil respiration (R-s) to biomass harvesting and green-tree retention in an effort to empirically assess their impacts on C cycling. We measured R-s and soil microclimatic variables over four growing seasons following implementation of these management practices using a fully replicated, operational-scale experiment in aspen-dominated forests in northern Minnesota. Treatments included three levels of biomass removal within harvested areas: whole-tree harvest (no slash deliberately retained), 20% slash retained, and stem-only harvest (all slash retained), and two levels of green-tree retention: 0.1 ha aggregate or none. The relative amount of biomass removed had a negligible effect on R-s in harvested areas, but treatment effects were probably obscured by heterogeneous slash configurations and rapid post-harvest regeneration of aspen in all of the treatments. Discrete measurements of R-s and soil temperature within green-tree aggregates were not discernible from surrounding harvested areas or unharvested control stands until the fourth year following harvest, when R-s was higher in unharvested controls than in aggregates and harvested stands. Growing season estimates of R-s showed that unharvested control stands had higher R-s than both harvested stands and aggregates in the first and third years following harvest. Our results suggest that retention of larger forest aggregates may be necessary to maintain ecosystem-level responses similar to those in unharvested stands. Moreover, they highlight the innate complexity of operational-scale research and suggest that the initial impacts of biomass harvest on R-s may be indiscernible from traditional harvest in systems where incidental breakage is high.

Plant Community Diversity and Tree Growth Following Single and Repeated Glyphosate Herbicide Applications to a White Spruce Plantation	FORESTS												Glyphosate herbicide is widely used to control bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) Beauv.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), and other competing species in regenerating white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) plantations in Alberta, Canada. In 2004, we initiated a study to examine the effects of the aerial application of glyphosate herbicide on plant community diversity and tree growth near Calling Lake, Alberta. Four treatments were applied: (a) no treatment (control); (b) herbicide application in the first growing season after harvesting; (c) herbicide application in the third growing season after harvesting; and (d) herbicide application in the second and fourth growing seasons after harvesting (two treatments). After 11 growing seasons, species richness was not significantly affected by treatment, while Shannon and Simpson index values were highest in areas treated with herbicide in the first growing season. Herbicide treatment did not have a significant effect on the cover of bluejoint reedgrass after 11 growing seasons, but did significantly reduce trembling aspen and paper birch cover and height. Application of glyphosate in the second and fourth growing seasons resulted in the greatest reductions to aspen cover and height, as well as significant increases in spruce diameter at age 11. Simulations with the Mixedwood Growth Model indicate that all tested herbicide treatments will reduce aspen volume while increasing spruce volume at age 90, with the largest impacts evident where two treatments were applied.					; Comeau, Phil/AAB-6481-2020	Comeau, Philip/0000-0003-2578-4289; 													1999-4907					MAR	2018	9	3							107	10.3390/f9030107	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f9030107													WOS:000428508200010

Lakeshore residential development and growth of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides): a cross-lakes comparison	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Lakeshore residential development is associated with changes in littoral habitat, riparian habitat, and ecosystem function with potential impacts ramifying through aquatic food webs. Effects of these changes on economically important game fishes may vary with fish size. We investigated largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) size-specific growth rates across 16 lakes spanning the range of lakeshore residential development in Wisconsin's Northern Highland Lake District using a longitudinal multilevel model. Growth rates of small fish had a strong positive relationship with lakeshore residential development. The strength of the relationship decreased with length and became increasingly negative for fish longer than 210 mm. This pattern may be driven by a release from density-dependent growth, shifts in available prey sources, reduced macrophyte cover, or angling-induced selection pressures. Regardless of the mechanism, our results indicate, relative to undeveloped lakes, largemouth bass in highly developed lakes take 1.5 growing seasons longer to enter the fishery (356 mm).

The lesser of two evils: seasonal migrations of Amazonian manatees in the Western Amazon	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												We investigated the paradox of why Amazonian manatees Trichechus inunguis undergo seasonal migrations to a habitat where they apparently fast. Ten males were tracked using VHF telemetry between 1994 and 2006 in the Mamiraua and Amana Sustainable Development Reserves, constituting the only long-term dataset on Amazonian manatee movements in the wild. Their habitat was characterized by analysing aquatic space and macrophyte coverage dynamics associated with the annual flood-pulse cycle of the River Solimoes. Habitat information came from fieldwork, two hydrographs, a three-dimensional model of the water bodies and classifications of Landsat-TM/ETM+ images. We show that during high-water season (mid-May to end-June), males stay in varzea lakes in association with macrophytes, which they select. We then show that, during low-water (October-November), the drastic reduction in aquatic space in the varzea leads to the risk of their habitat drying out and increases the manatees' vulnerability to predators such as caimans, jaguars and humans. This explains why males migrate to Ria Amana. Based on data on illegal hunting, we argue that this habitat variability influences females to migrate too. We then use published knowledge of the environment's dynamics to argue that when water levels are high, the habitats that can support the largest manatee populations are the varzeas of white-water rivers, and we conjecture that rias are the species' main low-water refuges throughout Western Amazonia. Finally, we warn that the species may be at greater risk than previously thought, because migration and low-water levels make manatees particularly vulnerable to hunters. Moreover, because the flooding regime of Amazonian rivers is strongly related to large-scale climatic phenomena, there might be a perilous connection between climate change and the future prospects for the species. Our experience reveals that the success of research and conservation of wild Amazonian manatees depends on close working relationships with local inhabitants.

Evolutionary ecology of endocrine-mediated life-history variation in the garter snake Thamnophis elegans	ECOLOGY												The endocrine system plays an integral role in the regulation of key life-history traits. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a hormone that promotes growth and reproduction, and it has been implicated in the reduction of lifespan. IGF-1 is also capable of responding plastically to environmental stimuli such as resource availability and temperature. Thus pleiotropic control of life-history traits by IGF-1 could provide a mechanism for the evolution of correlated life-history traits in a new or changing environment. An ideal system in which to investigate the role of IGF-1 in life-history evolution exists in two ecotypes of the garter snake Thamnophis elegans, which derive from a single recent ancestral source but have evolved genetically divergent life-history characteristics. Snakes from meadow populations near Eagle Lake, California ( USA) exhibit slower growth rates, lower annual reproductive output, and longer median adult lifespans relative to populations along the lakeshore. We hypothesized that the IGF-1 system has differentiated between these ecotypes and can account for increased growth and reproduction and reduced survival in lakeshore vs. meadow snakes. We tested for a difference in plasma IGF-1 levels in free-ranging snakes from replicate populations of each ecotype over three years. IGF-1 levels were significantly associated with adult body size, reproductive output, and season in a manner that reflects established differences in prey ecology and age/size-specific reproduction between the ecotypes. These. findings are discussed in the context of theoretical expectations for a trade-off between reproduction and lifespan that is mediated by pleiotropic endocrine mechanisms.

J	Kufel, L; Kufel, I				Kufel, L; Kufel, I			Chara beds acting as nutrient sinks in shallow lakes -: a review	AQUATIC BOTANY												The capability of Chara beds to act as nutrient sinks in shallow lakes is reviewed. Under favorable conditions charophytes form dense meadows. Biomass and nutrient content in such beds are comparable or even higher than in beds of vascular aquatic macrophytes. As some Chara species are capable of overwintering, the nutrient storage in plant biomass may extend beyond the growing season. Some commonly observed phenomena in vascular plants (nutrient uptake and mobilization of nutrients from the sediment) appear to be unlikely or negligible in Characeae. Charophytes have been reported to decompose slower than their vascular counterparts prolonging nutrient storage in plant biomass. Charophytes may also indirectly affect nutrient cycling in lakes. Utilization of bicarbonate is accompanied by precipitation of calcite during periods of intensive photosynthesis, favoring immobilization of P by binding in the crystal structure or sorption on sedimenting mineral particles. Charophytes are able to deliver oxygen to the sediment, thus potentially enhancing nitrification/denitrification processes and preventing iron-bound sediment phosphorus from being released to the overlying water. Furthermore, dense Chara meadows restrict sediment resuspension, consequently blocking an important internal source of nutrients to planktonic algae. We conclude that Chara meadows probably are an efficient nutrient trap in shallow lakes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cunha, DGF; Calijuri, MD				Fernandes Cunha, Davi Gasparini; Calijuri, Maria do Carmo			Limiting factors for phytoplankton growth in subtropical reservoirs: the effect of light and nutrient availability in different longitudinal compartments	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Limited information is available on the interactions between environmental factors and algal growth in tropical and subtropical aquatic systems. We investigated the relationships between algal biomass (measured as chlorophyll, Chl-a) and light, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in longitudinal zones of subtropical reservoirs. We studied the seasonal variation of water variables in Itupararanga Reservoir (Brazil) and compared the results with 16 other subtropical lakes and reservoirs. The longitudinal zones in Itupararanga Reservoir were considered statistically different (p 0.05, MANOVA). From the riverine zone to the dam region of the reservoir, Spearman Correlation Test suggested that light limitation and TP limitation tended to decrease and increase, respectively. Although nitrate concentrations were high (400 g/L), the Spearman coefficients between Chl-a and TN and the TN:TP ratios (11:1 TN:TP 35:1) indicated that nitrogen may be co-limiting algal growth in the studied water body. Putting Itupararanga in a regional context allowed assessment of potential influences of land use on trophic state. Within the subtropical dataset, TP explained a greater percentage of variance in Chl-a (R2 = 0.70) than TN (R2 = 0.17). The main land use type within the reservoirs drainage area significantly influenced the concentrations of TP, TN, and Chl-a (p 0.05, MANOVA), with different relationships between nutrients and chlorophyll in forested (R2 = 0.12-0.33), agricultural (R2 = 0.50-0.68) and urban (R2 = 0.09-0.64) watersheds. Comparisons with literature values and those from reservoirs with less altered watersheds indicated that Itupararanga Reservoir is reaching the mesotrophic-eutrophic boundary, and further nutrient enrichment could cause water quality degradation.

New ecological models of malaria that are based on both parasite prevalence and disease have been described. In this study, we examined district level data collected from paediatric BL cases in Kenya from 1988 through 1997 and assessed whether the distribution of district level incidence rates could be explained by new ecologic estimates of malaria risk. Chi- square tests and log- linear regression models were used to evaluate these associations. An association with tribe of origin as a factor also was examined. The 10- year average annual incidence rate ( IR) for Kenya was 0.61 per 100 000 children. Incidence rates varied by malaria transmission intensity as follows: low malaria risk ( BL IR = 0.39), arid / seasonal ( 0.25), highland ( 0.66), endemic coast ( 0.68), and endemic lake ( 1.23) ( v 2 = 11.32, P = 0.002). In a log- linear model, BL rates were 3.5 times greater in regions with chronic and intense malaria transmission intensity than in regions with no or sporadic malaria transmission ( odds ratio = 3.47, 95% confidence interval = 1.30 - 9.30), regardless of tribe. Although crude tribe- specific incidence rates ranged between 0.0 and 3.26, tribe was not associated with BL after controlling for malaria. These findings support the aetiologic role of intense malaria transmission intensity in BL.

However, some regions remain poorly documented. This is the case in the Beni basin and in particular in one of its main sub-basins, the Tuichi, an Andean foothills rivers flowing through the Madidi National Park in the Bolivian Amazonia. The knowledge of its ichthyological diversity is, however, essential for the management and protection of aquatic ecosystems, which are threatened by the development of infrastructures (dams, factories and cities), mining and deforestation. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has been relatively little used so far in the Amazon basin. We sampled eDNA from water in 34 sites in lakes and rivers in the Beni basin including 22 sites in the Tuichi sub-basin, during the dry season. To assess the biogeographical patterns of the amazonian ichthyofauna, we implemented a metabarcoding approach using two pairs of specific primers designed and developed in our laboratory to amplify two partially overlapping CO1 fragments, one of 185bp and another of 285bp. We detected 252 fish taxa (207 at species level) among which 57 are newly identified for the Beni watershed. Species compositions are significantly different between lakes and rivers but also between rivers according to their hydrographic rank and altitude. Furthermore, the diversity patterns are related to the different hydro-ecoregions through which the Tuichi flows. The eDNA approach makes it possible to identify and complete the inventory of the ichthyofauna in this still poorly documented Amazon basin. However, taxonomic identification remains constrained by the lack of reference barcodes in public databases and does not allow the assignment of all OTUs. Our results can be taken into account in conservation and management strategies and could serve as a baseline for future studies, including on other Andean tributaries.

We examined the diet of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritas) prior to, and immediately after, round goby population expansion at two colonies, Pigeon and Snake Islands, in eastern Lake Ontario from 1999 to 2007. Cormorant diet was determined from the examination of 10,167 pellets collected over the nine-year period. By the second year round gobies were found in the diet (2002 at Snake Island and 2003 at Pigeon Island) they were the main species consumed by cormorants at each colony. The dominance of round goby in cormorant diets had a significant effect on both daily fish consumption and seasonal trends in fish consumption compared to the pre-goby years. Seasonal differences that were observed during the pre-goby years were lost once gobies became the main diet component of cormorants. The rapid switch to a benthic prey such as round goby, from a largely limnetic fish diet demonstrates the adaptive foraging ability of cormorants. Round goby may act as a buffer for yellow perch and smallmouth bass, two sport fish impacted by cormorant predation in eastern Lake Ontario.

Genetic variation in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene of the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Acari: Ixodidae)	JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY												Genetic variation in the mitochondrial (mt) 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was examined for the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Say, 1821). Nine different haplotypes were detected among 369 adult D. variabilis collected from four localities in Canada. There were eight variable nucleotide positions in the 404 bp sequence alignment. Individuals of haplotype 1 occurred at frequency of > 75% at all localities. Five haplotypes were detected at only one of the four localities. High haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity, combined with significantly negative F-s values for ticks at three localities, suggest a recent population expansion. Genetic differences were found between populations at different localities, but a Mantel regression analysis revealed no association between genetic differences and geographical distances. There was also no association between tick haplotype and the prevalence of the bacterium, Rickettsia montanensis Weiss and Moulder, 1984, in D. variabilis among localities or on opposite sides of Blackstrap Lake (Saskatchewan). The 16S rDNA haplotypes from Canadian populations of D. variabilis formed a clade with those from the eastern and central U.S.A., to the exclusion of D. variabilis from geographically isolated populations in the western U.S.A. Although sample sizes for D. variabilis in the eastern U.S.A. are small, there may be genetic divergence between populations in Canada and those in the eastern U.S.A., which may have implications for studies on the pathogenic agents transmitted by D. variabilis to its hosts.

The occurring species, Planktothrix rubescens and P. agardhii had similar depth distributions and seasonal dynamics, both forming metalimnetic blooms in 10-14 in depth. By comparing the resource availability and temperature in Lake Steinsfiorden with demands determined in laboratory studies, temperature and light were identified as the most important factors controlling growth and depth distribution of Planklothlix spp. In addition, macronutrients, especially nitrogen, may have limited growth in periods. A lowering of nutrient supplies over time could in addition to the prevailing suboptimal temperature and light conditions prevent the population of Planktothrix spp. from forming blooms. On two occasions, a major decrease in Planktothrix spp. abundance in the open water could be linked to a transport towards the banks of Lake Steinsfiorden with subsequent decomposition in the littoral zone. Our results show that the depth distribution and seasonal dynamics of Planktothrix spp. in Lake Steinfjorden. is controlled by environmental factors in a similar way as in. other Nordic, Central European and North American lakes.

The concentrations of NP2EO, NP1EO, 4-NP, BPA, 4-CP and 4-t-OP were up to 295.14, 448.48, 45.28, 530.33, 8.96 and 21.37 ng L-1 in water, and up to 297.11, 809.63, 4.58, 166.87, 3.62 and 40.69 ng g(-1) dry weight in surface sediment, respectively. Except BPA in water, concentrations of all the other phenolic compounds in both of the matrices were higher in January than in July, 2011. The concentrations decreased significantly with an increase in distance from the sampling locations which were adjacent to the urban areas (Kunming City, Chenggong City and Jinning City). The pollution of phenolic EDCs came mainly from industry, agriculture and daily life. The relationships between the concentrations of target compounds and the six water quality parameters were evaluated. There were significant positive correlations between concentrations of phenolic compounds in water and in surface sediment. For sediment cores, three clearly separated maxima occurred in segments 0-5 cm (the late 2000s), 5-10 cm (the early and mid of 2000s) and 20-25 cm (the mid of 1980s), respectively. NP2EO, NP1EO and BPA were the three dominant compounds in the lake.					pan, xue/KVV-2495-2024; farong, li/GZK-5313-2022	Pan, Xuejun/0000-0003-3772-6908; Li, FARONG/0000-0002-2386-9134													1464-0325	1464-0333				APR	2012	14	4					1275	1282		10.1039/c2em10856a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em10856a								22421980					WOS:000302017700019

Water samples were collected at 5 and 30 in below the surface; when the lake was stratified, these depths corresponded to the epilimnion and hypolimnion. Changes in small-eukaryote structure were analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and cloning and sequencing of the 18S rRNA genes. Terminal restriction fragments from clones were used to reveal the dominant taxa in T-RFLP profiles of the environmental samples. Spumella-like cells (Chrysophyceae) did not dominate the small eukaryote community identified by molecular techniques in lacustrine ecosystems. Small eukaryotes appeared to be dominated by heterotrophic cells, particularly Cercozoa, which represented nearly half of the identified phylotypes, followed by the Fungi-LKM11 group (25%), choanoflagellates (10.3%) and Chrysophyceae (8.9%). Bicosoecida, Cryptophyta, and ciliates represented less than 9% of the community studied. No seasonal reproducibility in temporal evolution of the small-eukaryote community was observed from I year to the next. The T-RFLP patterns were related to bottom-tip (resources) and top-down (grazing) variables using canonical correspondence analysis. The results showed a strong top-down regulation of small eukaryotes by zooplankton, more exactly, by cladocerans at 5 in and copepods at 30 m. Among bottom-up factors, temperature had a significant effect at both depths. The concentrations of nitrogenous nutrients and total phosphorus also had an effect on small-eukaryote dynamics at 5 m, whereas bacterial abundance and dissolved oxygen played a more important structuring role in the deeper zone.

In ice-affected rivers, this includes the interaction of bridge infrastructure with river ice. Advancements in river-ice science and modelling of ice processes in ice-covered rivers have enhanced the abilities of civil/hydrotechnical engineers to plan, design, and construct bridges in and along rivers with seasonal ice covers. In this paper, an overview is presented of ice-related considerations with respect to bridges. The bottom-chord elevation of the bridge superstructure with respect to water and ice levels, pier design to withstand ice forces, the waterway opening for ice passage, ice-induced scour, and research needs are discussed. However, as outlined in the paper, research on ice loads and passage at bridge sites and on hydroclimatic and ice conditions that led to bridge damage and failure remains needed.

With that in mind, this study aimed to map spatio-temporal variation of macrophyte cover using Landsat 5, 7 and 8 images between 1984-2021 at Jupia reservoir, in south east of Brazil, besides determining curves and maps of macrophyte cover permanence. The identification of these organisms in the images, and their distinction from other vegetations, was made through spectral indices (NDVI, GNDVI and GSAVI) and the determination of the characteristic range of each of these classes, which was given by probability distributions. Interannual variations were observed in the spatial arrangement of macrophytes and the area's growth trend, possibly being caused by the implantation of an upstream reservoir. Although the number of images without interference was a limitation, the construction of a historical series of macrophytes occupation and the determination of permanence curves and maps proved to be satisfactory and could help on the decision-making processes for the management of these organisms.					; Bleninger, Tobias/H-3269-2012	Lipski, Bernardo/0000-0003-1168-8528; 													1414-381X	2318-0331					2022	27						1	17		10.1590/2318-0331.272220220074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/2318-0331.272220220074													WOS:000891294000001

Structure of the ichthyoplankton community in a Neotropical floodplain lake affected by environmental degradation	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												Many Amazonian fish' reproduction is associated to seasonality and to the conditions of habitat integrity. In a Neotropical floodplain lake of the Amazon region, the temporal structure of ichthyoplankton was investigated and the hypothesis that the density of fish eggs and larvae and the diversity of species vary between two areas with different levels of environmental changes occurred was tested. The sampling occurred monthly between September 2017 and August 2018. Six sampling stations were used, distributed in locations close to and far from the altered area. 195 eggs and 1,785 larvae from nine orders and 27 species were captured. The eggs were from nonmigratory fish species and occurred during two moments. The larvae presented different abundance peaks during the sample months and all the initial stages of development occurred. Clupeiformes was the most abundant and Characiformes the species richest. The density of the ichthyoplankton and the diversity of species presented temporal variation. However, only the larval density varied between the areas of the lake. The Lake Jua is a spawning area for resident fish and is a nursery and growth area for larvae of species with different ecological categories and socioeconomic importance during different periods of the year.

In order to know the diversity patterns of these fish in whitewater rivers of the Central Amazon, we used data from the main channel benthic fish assemblage of the Japur??, Purus and Madeira rivers and tested the hypothesis that there are marked spatial and seasonal differences in the composition of the fish community among them. For this, we used a multivariate dispersion test, total 3 diversity and its decomposition into local (LCBD) and species contribution to 3 diversity (SCBD). Additionally, we tested for relationships between LCBD values and richness, total abundance, and environmental variables. We categorized species with higher SCBD values into resident or migratory to investigate the potential importance of floodplains to benthic fish assemblage of the main channel of whitewater rivers. Our results corroborate the proposed hypothesis, showing that there are seasonal and inter-river differences in benthic ichthyofauna, being more evident for the Purus River. LCBD showed strong negative relationships with species richness and total abundance, particularly in the Japur?? and Madeira rivers in rising season, indicating that rivers and season with high uniqueness in their composition also had low richness and abundance. LCBD was negatively correlated with conductivity and pH, which increased with declining these environmental variables, as observed mainly in Japur?? River in both seasons. Approximately one third of the species had higher than average SCBD values and were considered major contributors to 3 diversity, as well as classified as migratory. This demonstrates the importance of conducting studies that use spatial and seasonal variables, in addition to including the background fish fauna in conservation studies, expanding the protected area and taking into account the different patterns of diversity between rivers. Furthermore, these differences in assemblage composition might be explained by the asymmetrical spatial use of habitats during different seasons, strongly suggesting the importance of the flood-pulse cycle for maintaining diversity in this environment.

We analyzed changes in occurrence, taxa richness and relative abundance of diatom and invertebrate assemblages in four saline wetlands located at the same altitude (approx. 3,330 mast), in the Salar de Antofalla (Catamarca, Argentina). Biological samples were taken seasonally during a 1-year period, together with water variables, which were used in ordination techniques to characterize the sites. Water ionic content and biological variables, such as microcrustacean abundance and diatom richness, were evaluated as possible factors affecting the assemblages' distribution. The wetlands ranged from meso- to hyperhaline habitats and showed distinctive morphological, physical and chemical characteristics. Diatoms (42 taxa) and invertebrates (15 taxa) were collected from all sites, and diatom taxa richness was negatively correlated with water conductivity. According to multivariate analysis, the distribution of both communities was significantly explained by water hardness, whereas copepod abundance also influenced the diatom flora. We conclude that, at the same altitude and, consequently, UV radiation exposure, variables related to ionic content and/or biological parameters of the aquatic habitat may act as determinants of the biota distribution in these extreme environments.

Both expanding wildlife populations and the development of urbanised areas reduce the potential contact distance between wildlife species and vehicles. Many recent studies have been conducted to better understand the factors that influence wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) and provide mitigation methods. Most of these studies examined road density, traffic volume, seasonal fluctuations, etc. However, in analysing the distribution of WVC, few studies have considered a spatial and significant distance geostatistical analysis approach that includes how different land-use categories are associated with the distance to WVCs. Our study investigated the spatial distribution of agricultural land, meadows and pastures, forests, built-up areas, rivers, lakes, and ponds, to highlight the most dangerous sections of roadways where WVCs occur. We examined six potential 'hot spot' distances (5-10-25-50-100-200 m) to evaluate the role different landscape elements play in the occurrence of WVC. The near analysis tool showed that a distance of 10-25 m to different landscape elements provided the most sensitive results. Hot spots associated with agricultural land, forests, as well as meadows and pastures, peaked on roadways in close proximity (10 m), while hot spots associated with built-up areas, rivers, lakes, and ponds peaked on roadways farther (200 m) from these land-use types. We found that the order of habitat importance in WVC hot spots was agricultural land < forests < meadows and pastures < built-up areas < rivers < lakes and ponds. This methodological approach includes general hot-spot analysis as well as differentiated distance analysis which helps to better reveal the influence of landscape structure on WVCs.					; Ignatavicius, Gytautas/A-9978-2017	Galinskaite, Lina/0009-0002-7496-9423; 														2220-9964				JAN	2022	11	1							63	10.3390/ijgi11010063	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11010063													WOS:000746009300001

Few studies regarding status and distribution of Vulnerable Mugger have been conducted in Nepal. However, studies on ecology and other aspects of the species are limited. The goal of this study was to determine the Mugger crocodile's population status, habitat occupancy, and conservation threats in the Ghodaghodi lake complex, located in the western lowlands of Nepal. A detailed survey was conducted on 18 lakes of the lake complex in February, 2021. The population status of the Mugger was surveyed by walking along the entire boundary line of each lake. For habitat survey, perimeter of all the lakes of the complex was divided into the number of stations spaced at 500 m intervals. Habitat factors associated with the presence and absence of the Mugger were analyzed using Generalized Linear Model under binary logistic regression and likelihood ratio test was performed to test predictors for statistical significance. During the survey, 26 muggers were recorded. The probability of sighting Mugger in the lake complex was significantly differ by distance to settlement, distance to river, and human disturbances, among the nine habitat variables examined. Similarly, habitat modification and illegal fishing were ranked as most severe threats to Mugger crocodile in the lake complex. The concerned authorities, responsible for managing the lake complex shall pay attention on controlling the major identified threats like habitat modification, illegal fishing, unmanaged infrastructure development, and pollution in the lake complex in order to support future conservation of Vulnerable Mugger population in the area. Furthermore, a detailed and extensive study is suggested to investigate the movement of Muggers between different lakes of the complex as well as from Ghodaghodi lake complex to the nearby rivers during breeding season in order to support effective planning and execution of habitat management activities of this Vulnerable species.					; Gautam, Ambika/AFU-8086-2022; Mahat, Niraj/IAQ-5118-2023; Bhattarai, Dharmagat/AFK-8286-2022	Mahat, Niraj/0000-0001-7666-037X; Pandeya, Pratik/0000-0002-2710-1309; Lamichhane, Saurav/0000-0002-5204-3067; Bhattarai, Divya/0000-0002-3498-8024; 														2351-9894				JAN	2022	33								e01977	10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01977	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01977													WOS:000734887900010

Space use of juvenile and subadult yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in the Detroit River using acoustic telemetry: incorporating variable detection ranges in vegetated areas	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Understanding the space use of fishes in early life stages provides information that can contribute to effective fisheries management; however, it can be difficult to track fish in shallow, densely vegetated areas. Using acoustic telemetry, 60 subadult yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were tagged and monitored in a vegetated area of the Detroit River (May-November 2018). Variable detection range from submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) was incorporated in estimates by applying a spatiotemporal correction to aid with interpretation of seasonal changes in activity space. Although subadult yellow perch were commonly detected in the array, demonstrating the importance of SAV habitat (mean detection residency index: 0.85), 60% of individuals were not detected following August, the period with highest activity space estimates, likely due to seasonal movements and predation. Individuals were more commonly detected during the daylight hours compared to night, but activity peaked at crepuscular periods.

Here, we investigate the nursing areas of L. miodon, the timing of reproductive activities of littoral and pelagic L. miodon, and the timing of reproductive activities of pelagic S. tanganicae in the Congolese waters of the northern end of Lake Tanganyika (Bujumbura sub-basin). Nursing areas were determined year-round (2009-2010) based on the presence of clupeid larvae at two sandy and two stony beaches. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the proportion of fish having ripe gonads were used to study variation in reproductive indices in space (littoral vs. pelagic zones) during one year (2013-2014), as well as in time (dry vs. rainy season) during three years (2013-2016). Larvae of L. miodon were more frequently encountered on sandy than on stony beaches. Mature L. miodon females were more abundant in the littoral than in the pelagic zone, while the proportion of mature males in both habitats was similar. Irregular, low amplitude peaks could be distinguished in the GSI and proportion of mature males and females, but averages only differed between the dry and the rainy season in males. In contrast, GSI and proportions of mature males and females in S. tanganicae were higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. The reproductive effort of males and females of S. tanganicae and littoral L. miodon, but not pelagic L. miodon, was strongly synchronized. Interestingly, reproductive investment was also synchronised between pelagic male L. miodon, and pelagic S. tanganicae. Our time series strongly supports the view that L. miodon reproduces year-round in the littoral zone, while reproduction in S. tanganicae is seasonal. For fisheries management, we recommend year-round protection of sandy beaches, which are the main breeding grounds for L. miodon.

Carbon dioxide emission from drawdown areas of a Mediterranean reservoir	LIMNETICA												Sediment beds from drawdown areas of reservoirs constitute a relevant hotspot for carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to the atmosphere. This CO2 source is especially relevant in the case of Mediterranean reservoirs, where hydrological variability favors the exposure of large sediment areas to air. In spite of this, the role of dry sediments as CO2 emitters has been typically neglected in lakes and reservoirs greenhouse gas emission assessments, and there is also a lack of research on the spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from drawdown sediments. In this study we contribute to this knowledge by combining drone-based aero-photogrammetry techniques with in situ infrarred gas analyzer measurements to assess the magnitude and spatial variability of CO2 fluxes from the drawdown area of a Mediterranean reservoir (El Gergal, Southwestern Spain) during one dry season. Our results show that during survey dry sediments in El Gergal were a relevant net CO2 source to the atmosphere, with a mean emission of 0.36 +/- 0.38 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1). In addition, CO2 fluxes from El Gergal drawdown depict a marked spatial variability, with maximum values measured in areas influenced by river or intermittent streams discharges. Distance to the shore, sediment particle size, pH and temperature also have a significant effect on CO2 emissions from the reservoir dry banks. The expected strengthening of droughts intensity and frequency in the Mediterranean region could enhance the role of exposed sediments from the drawdown of reservoirs as CO2 source to the atmosphere.					; Marcé, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Sammartino, Simone/T-5530-2017; Escot, Carmelo/ABH-8609-2020; Obrador, Biel/A-1856-2009; Montes-Pérez, Jorge/HKO-6043-2023; Moreno-Ostos, Enrique/R-6782-2019; Marce, Rafael/H-5147-2012	Moreno Ostos, Enrique/0000-0001-9471-3922; Sammartino, Simone/0000-0001-7052-5468; Pozzo-Pirotta, Leonardo Jose/0000-0003-4444-006X; Escot, Carmelo/0000-0002-5589-0579; Obrador, Biel/0000-0003-4050-0491; Montes-Perez, Jorge Juan/0000-0002-0257-4062; Marce, Rafael/0000-0002-7416-4652													0213-8409	1989-1806					2022	41	1					61	72		10.23818/limn.41.05	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.41.05													WOS:000823988700005

Pre-copulatory bite wounds as evidence of aggressive competition for mating in the neotropical freshwater stingray Potamotrygon motoro	ACTA AMAZONICA												Reproductive aspects of Amazonian freshwater stingrays are still poorly studied, however, it is known that the copulatory behavior in some species is related to the hydrometric seasons (high and low water). In order to assess the reproductive activity prior to copulation, we examined bite wounds in Potamotrygon motoro of Catalao Lake, in Amazonas state, Brazil. Specimens of both sexes showed wounds on the pectoral fins. Males presented a large amount of bite wounds, distributed randomly throughout the body, while females had more bite wounds on the posterior region. The higher number of wounds in males is assumed to indicate aggressive interactions among males in competition for females, caused by attempts to prevent other males from mating with the target female. The behavior is likely owed to the confinement of the stingrays in the lake during the low-water period.					; PAXIÚBA DUNCAN, WALLICE LUIZ/AAG-1184-2020; Shibuya, Akemi/C-9204-2012	PAXIUBA DUNCAN, WALLICE LUIZ/0000-0002-1279-7163; Shibuya, Akemi/0000-0002-7172-9742													0044-5967	1809-4392					2022	52	1					45	48		10.1590/1809-4392202101762	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1809-4392202101762													WOS:000771754800007
J	Parkes, SM; Duggan, IC				Parkes, Samantha M.; Duggan, Ian C.			Are zooplankton invasions in constructed waters facilitated by simple communities?	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Constructed water bodies (e.g. water supply and hydroelectricity dams, ornamental ponds) are invaded at faster rates than natural waters, but the mechanisms that lead to this pattern are uncertain. We aimed to determine whether constructed lakes have lower zooplankton species richness or differ in species composition relative to natural waters, which might allow them to be invaded more readily. Location North Island, New Zealand. Methods Sediment cores were collected from 23 natural and 23 constructed lakes, ponds and reservoirs. Zooplankton diapausing eggs were hatched from sediments to assess species composition and richness. Results Average species richness between natural and constructed water bodies was not significantly different. Stepwise linear regression indicated latitude and maximum depth were significant predictors of species richness in natural waters (P = 0.002 and 0.016, respectively). No significant predictors were elucidated for constructed waters. Species in natural waters consisted mainly of planktonic species, while assemblages in constructed waters were more varied, comprising of more littoral and benthic species, and included many species recorded from only single water bodies. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that trophic state explained the greatest proportion of variation in species composition of natural waters (P = 0.002). Distance to nearest water body and number of water bodies within a 20 km radius (i.e. opportunity) explained the greatest proportion in constructed waters (P = 0.040 and 0.038, respectively). Main conclusions Natural and constructed waters had similar species richness per water body, but community composition varied between them. The core group of species found in natural waters are better adapted to pelagic conditions, and may therefore be better at reducing establishment rates of new arrivals than assemblages in constructed water bodies, which had more varied assemblages. Our study suggests that manipulating new water bodies, so that they develop mature communities faster, may reduce establishment rates of non-indigenous species.

CDOM fluorescence yield is, however, affected by water temperature at the time of measurement, a factor which varies on both diel and seasonal timescales. A temperature correction must therefore be applied to these data. We present data on temporal and site-specific variability in temperature quenching of CDOM fluorescence for water from a humic lake and one of its main inflows in the west of Ireland. In addition, we present a temperature compensation equation and show that this equation is an improvement on methods previously proposed.

J	Zhang, YD; Sun, YG; Chen, JP				Zhang, Yongdong; Sun, Yongge; Chen, Jianping			Geochemical evidence of lake environments favorable for the formation of excellent source rocks: A case study from the third member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation in the Qikou Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Lacustrine hydrocarbon source rocks with high quantity and quality of organic matter (OM) are developed within the third member of the Eocene Shahejie formation (Es-3) in the Qikou Sag of the Huanghua Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, Eastern China. However, the paleolake environments associated with deposition of these rocks remain relatively undescribed, restricting our understanding of the biogeochemical processes which contributed to the development of excellent source rocks and inhibiting efforts for exploration of lacustrine hydrocarbon deposits. In this study, 18 core samples from the Es-3 interval of Well Gangshen 4 in Qikou Sag were subject to a detailed analysis of bulk OM, biomarkers, molecular carbon isotopes, trace elements, and phosphorus (P) to investigate the environment and ecosystem of the ancient lake in which the rocks were deposited. High values of gammacerane index (ay. 0.35) recorded in the samples reveals the oxic-anoxic stratification in the water column that persisted for the majority of the year due to the hot climate and great depth of the lake during this period. Meanwhile C-13-depleted hopanes (lower than -63.2 parts per thousand) indicate an input of OM from chemoautotrophic and methanotrophic bacteria, supported by the production of CO2 and CH4 due to the anaerobic respiration of OM in the hypolimnion or sediments. The abundances of total organic carbon (TOC) relative to total P (TOC/P, mole ratio, ay. 289.9) indicates the preferential release of P from sediments in an anoxic environment. However, the low (<2.0) Ni/Co and V/Cr ratios and moderate (ay. 1.48) pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios suggest periodic oxidation of the hypolimnion, which may be a result of replenishment of oxygen during the short-term mixing of the water column driven by seasonal cooling and wind disturbance. Excess P was introduced into the epilimnion via mixing, which initiated high algal productivity after further stratification of the water column. Algal OM produced in this early stratification phase was crucial for the formation of excellent source rocks. The large variation of delta C-13 in TOC, n-alkanes, and isoprenoids reflects changes in CO2 concentrations or carbon isotopes in the photic zone, which may be attributable to increased inputs of terrestrial OM in response to a changing climate.																			0264-8172	1873-4073				FEB	2022	136								105435	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2021.105435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2021.105435		DEC 2021											WOS:000753385800002

The Effects of Tropical Cyclone-Generated Deposition on the Sustainability of the Pearl River Marsh, Louisiana: The Importance of the Geologic Framework	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Shoreline retreat is a tremendously important issue along the coast of the northern Gulf of Mexico, especially in Louisiana. Although this marine transgression results from a variety of causes, the crucial factor is the difference between marsh surface elevation and rising sea levels. In most cases, the primary cause of a marsh's inability to keep up with sea level is the lack of input of inorganic material. Although tropical cyclones provide an important source of such sediment, little effort has been made to determine the point of origin of the deposited material. In this study we use sedimentary, geochemical and biogeochemical data to identify the bed of the Pearl River and/or Lake Borgne as the source of a similar to 5 cm thick clastic layer deposited on the surface of the Pearl River marsh on the Louisiana/Mississippi border. Radiochemical chronologies and sedimentary evidence indicate that this layer was associated with the passage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. As this material would otherwise have been lost to the system, this deposition indicates a net gain to marsh surface elevation. Accretion rates, determined from 137Cs and 14C profiles and the use of the Katrina layer as a stratigraphic marker, indicate that short-term (similar to 50 years) rates are as much as an order of magnitude higher than the long-term (1000s of years) rates. We suggest that the marsh's geologic setting in an incised river valley with steep vertical constraints and a large fluvial discharge, promotes rapid accretion rates, with rates accelerating as the sea moves inland, due to extended hydroperiods and the input of clastic material from both the marine and terrestrial sides. These rates are especially large when compared to accretion occurring in the more common open marshes fringing the Gulf that lack fluvial input. The difference is particularly large when related to marsh recovery/regrowth following the deposition of thick hurricane-generated clastic layers. Given the number of similar incised river valleys along the Gulf Coast, we believe that understanding the processes controlling marsh accretion in such environments is essential in evaluating marsh sustainability on a regional basis.

As a climate-sensitive region, the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB) has experienced extensive land-use transitions. A three-year manipulative experiment was conducted in two grassland types around the QLB, including a natural alpine grassland (NG) and its adjacent restored grassland (RG), to examine the responses of soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content to nutrient application with land-use. N addition continuously increased soil NO3--N (SAN) content of NG in the whole experiment period, while displaying no detectable effect on SAN content of RG in the first experiment year. Nutrient addition presented no direct effects on soil total N (STN) content. However, N addition potentially promoted STN content indirectly by increasing SAN content, both in NG and RG. P addition significantly increased soil available P (SAP) content during the whole study period for both grasslands. Nevertheless, P addition significantly increased soil total P (STP) content of NG in the last two experiment years, while only elevating STP content of RG in the last experiment year. The results revealed that soil N and P content presented convergent and divergent responses to nutrient addition between NG and RG. STN and STP content were both positively related to growing season precipitation (GSP). SAN content was positively associated with growing season temperature in NG, and RG in N addition treatment. SAP content was consistently positively related to GSP in P addition treatment, but negatively related to GSP in the treatment without P addition, both in NG and RG. These findings highlight the importance of precipitation for soil nutrient accumulation, and imply that warming and increasing precipitation will be beneficial for the mineralization of soil N and P, respectively, in this semi-arid grassland ecosystem.					; Li, Qi/H-4374-2011; Zhao, Liang/T-9147-2019	Li, Qi/0000-0001-5168-2492; zhao, liang/0000-0002-2571-3475													0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 1	2019	282						1	12		10.1016/j.agee.2019.05.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.05.010													WOS:000500209500001

First, restricted transport capacity limits individual equipment items to a volume and mass that can be slung by small helicopters. Second, low atmospheric oxygen and pressure reduces the effectiveness of combustion, limiting a system's ability to pump and heat water. Third, thick supraglacial debris, which is both highly uneven and unstable, inhibits direct access to the ice surface, hinders the manoeuvring of equipment and limits secure sites for equipment placement. Fourth, englacial debris can slow the drilling rate such that continued drilling becomes impracticable and/or boreholes deviate substantially from vertical. Because of these challenges, field-based englacial and subglacial data required to calibrate numerical models of high-elevation debris-covered glaciers are scarce or absent. Here, we summarise our experiences of hot-water drilling over two field seasons (2017-2018) at the debris-covered Khumbu Glacier, Nepal, where we melted 27 boreholes up to 192 m length, at elevations between 4900 and 5200 m a.s.l.

Optimum timing of propiconazole to manage narrow brown leaf spot in the main and ratoon rice crops in Texas	CROP PROTECTION												Narrow brown leaf spot (NBLS) is a foliar disease of rice caused by Cercospora janseana. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of frequency and timing of propiconazole (PropiMax) applications on rice NBLS severity and grain yield in the main and ratoon (second) crops. Field experiments were established at Eagle Lake and Beaumont, Texas in the years 2010-2012 and 2014 to 2016 respectively. The Eagle Lake trials evaluated two rates of propiconazole (0.16 and 0.32 kg a.i. ha(-1)) at two application timings (boot and heading growth stages) on the main crop, in combination with or without a single application at the boot stage on the ratoon crop. The Beaumont trials evaluated four main crop application timings (7 days after panicle differentiation, boot, heading, and 7 days after heading) at 0.32 kg a.i. ha(-1) in combination with a single application at boot stage on the ratoon crop. Fungicide application frequency of up to three main-crop applications with a single ratoon-crop application was also evaluated in the Beaumont trials. NBLS severity on the rice flag leaves was visually evaluated prior to harvest in the main and ratoon crops. At both locations, fungicide treatments significantly reduced NBLS severity in the main and ratoon crops compared to the non-sprayed control in each of year evaluated. Among the single fungicide application treatments, NBLS severity in the main crop was consistently lower when the fungicide was applied at the heading stage than at any other application stages. Fungicide application at any stage of the main crop significantly reduced NBLS severity in the ratoon crop. An additional fungicide application at the boot stage of the ratoon crop further reduced NBLS severity in four of the six seasons tested. In the Eagle Lake trials, both rates of the fungicide evaluated were comparable in their efficacy in reducing NBLS severity. In Beaumont trials, where multiple fungicide applications were evaluated, main-crop NBLS severity decreased as the number of applications increased. At these low to moderate NBLS severity levels, rice grain yields were not significantly affected, at either of the locations.																			0261-2194	1873-6904				OCT	2019	124								104854	10.1016/j.cropro.2019.104854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.104854													WOS:000481560000020

We studied the dynamics of DOM in a Mediterranean lagoon dominated by seasonal submerged vegetation and receiving torrential freshwater inputs. In order to trace changes in DOM quality throughout the year in relation with potential DOM sources, we used spectroscopic techniques including UV-visible absorbance and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. The quality of the lagoon DOM fluctuates on a seasonal basis between the characteristics of torrential inputs and macrophytes. Humification and aromaticity of DOM increased markedly after the torrential inputs of materials derived from terrestrial vegetation and soils in the catchment. The macrophytes in the lagoon contributed with less humified materials and protein-like compounds. Other minor processes such as seawater entrances, photodegradation or temporary bottom hypoxia translated into sporadic DOM quality changes. These results highlight the need of a whole ecosystem approach to understand changes in DOM quality due to ecosystem processes that might otherwise be exclusively attributed to DOM reactivity.					; Catalán, Núria/I-3262-2018; Obrador, Biel/A-1856-2009; Catalan, Nuria/I-3262-2018	Pretus, Joan Lluis/0000-0002-4375-8626; Obrador, Biel/0000-0003-4050-0491; Catalan, Nuria/0000-0002-2433-4190													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2014	728	1					111	124		10.1007/s10750-014-1811-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1811-y													WOS:000332745800008

The leaf flora is characterised by microphyllous and notophyllous entire margined leaves that are suggested to be related to the Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae, although many cannot be firmly placed in modern families. The wood is the oldest member of Cynometroxylon and confirms that the Detarieae were diverse by the early Paleogene. The palynoflora is dominated by Ailanthipites daedaleus and Triporopollenites mwaduiensis with lesser amounts of small tricolpate (Tricolpites) and monosulcate (Lilliacidites) grains together with spores (Cyathidites spp., Triporoletes laevigatus) and freshwater algal cysts. Other components of the palynoresidue include abundant charcoalified tracheids and fungal hyphae. The low diversity and sparse palynoflora suggests a restricted catchment with little input from the regional vegetation. The sediments accumulated in a freshwater lacustrine environment with palynological input from the crater walls that were covered bylaw diversity vegetation. This is supported by the leaf floras. Although the leaf floras are more diverse with nine morphotypes identified, the small leaves (microphyll to notophyll) suggest a water-limited palaeoenvironment This is supported by the low diversity and abundance of fern and bryophyte spores. The presence of a single wood taxon not only indicates that there were large trees around the crater-lake but that the aboreal component was of low diversity. These observations suggest an open woodland-like setting, while the taxonomic affinities of the wood (Cynometra) suggest a humid microclimate possibly with marked wetdry seasonal contrasts.

Using paleolimnology to track the impacts of early Arctic peoples on freshwater ecosystems from southern Baffin Island, Nunavut	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Paleolimnological approaches can be used to determine the ways in which past Arctic peoples have affected the ecosystems in which they live, and simultaneously to reconstruct the climate and other aspects of the environment that may have influenced local populations. Here we analyze sediment cores from seven ponds on the south-western coast of Baffin Island, Nunavut, in order to assess the impacts of early Arctic peoples on freshwater ecosystems. Prior to the historic Inuit occupation, the study area was extensively inhabited by Thule culture Inuit (ca 1200-1600 AD) and by an earlier Arctic group, the Dorset culture Palaeo-Eskimos (ca 500 BC-1500 AD) and their predecessors from as early as 2500 BC. The study ponds were selected to cover a gradient of the intensity of human activity in their catchments. The ecological impacts of early hunting societies can be detected using paleolimnology because the butchering of marine mammals released nutrients that eutrophied nearby ponds and left distinct geochemical signals in the sediments. The degree of eutrophication in the small freshwater ponds depended on the length of the occupation, as well as the amount and type of marine mammals taken as primary prey items (eg, whales, walrus, or seals). All sediment cores were AMS C-14 dated to establish their chronologies, and analyzed for diatoms and stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15). Both diatoms and sedimentary delta N-15 have been previously demonstrated to respond sensitively to nutrient enrichment from Inuit whalers. Our delta N-15 and diatom data record nutrient enrichment in lakes surrounded by either long-term Thule or Dorset settlements. The Dorset sites that were the locations of periodic seasonal gatherings did not register any evidence of eutrophication in the nearby ponds, reflecting the shorter, less intensive nature of these occupations. Similarly, nearby control ponds with no evidence of significant human activity in their catchments showed little-to-no changes in delta N-15 profiles and diatom assemblages. Due to slow rates of decomposition, nutrients from butchered marine animal bones continue to influence the freshwater sites into which they drain, as evidenced by higher than typical nutrient and production-related water chemistry variables.

A total of 192 quadrats were randomly placed in the littoral region of 12 similar ponds containing varying degrees of A. philoxeroides infestation to estimate A. philoxeroides 'cover (%)' and number of associated macrophyte species in each quadrat. Overall, 20 associated macrophyte species, including 16 aquatic/littoral-associated, 2 non-aquatic species, and grasses and sedges, were found to be present. A. philoxeroides infestation was categorized into 4 cover grades (Grade I-IV) from lowest (no/negligible: <10% cover) to highest (>60% cover). For each season, significant differences in the total number of associated macrophyte species across the 4 A. philoxeroides cover grades were found. A Poisson-regression model showed that for each season, even when the effect of other invasive species was adjusted, the number of associated native macrophyte species in a quadrat decreases significantly with increase in A. philoxeroides cover. A comparison of the quadrat communities between the lowest grade (Grade I) and highest grade (Grade IV) of A. philoxeroides infestation showed a significant reduction of species richness, diversity and evenness from the lowest to the highest infestation grades. Again, Mann-Whitney U tests further revealed that the number of native macrophyte species was significantly lower at highest (Grade IV) A. philoxeroides infestation than that at lowest infestation (Grade I). The presence of multiple invaders in A. philoxeroides infested aquatic ecosystems is also reported, indicating probable facilitative interactions between A. philoxeroides and other invasive species. The socio-economic valuation of some important native plants, which were found to be significantly reduced at high infestation levels of A. philoxeroides, has also been highlighted.

Seasonal variability of secondary production of cladocerans and rotifers, and their trophic role in Lake Tana, Ethiopia, a large, turbid, tropical highland lake	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Daily and annual production rates of eight cladoceran and two rotifer species, and their seasonal variation and trophic role in the large, turbid, tropical Lake Tana, Ethiopia, were assessed in 2003-2005. Laboratory cultures were used to infer cladoceran development times, and secondary production was estimated using the growth increment summation and recruitment methods. Production for both taxa was highest in October-November, after the rainy season, and lowest in January-April during the dry season. Cladocerans and rotifers comprised 24% of the metazoan zooplankton biomass of 45.1 mg DW m(-3), but comprised 53% of its production. Daily production for cladocerans and rotifers, respectively, was 1.23 and 0.94 mg DW m(-3) d(-1), and annual production was 447.9 and 353.5 mg DW m(-3) y(-1). Energy transfer efficiency from producers to zooplankton was 1.3% and 4.4% from zooplankton to planktivores. Herbivores consumed 3.4% of primary production and planktivores 36% of zooplankton production. High biomass turnover rates of cladocerans and rotifers sustain planktivores and, after a month's delay, decomposed Microcystis provides their main food source during the pre-and post-rainy months in Lake Tana.

Short-term changes in-stream macroinvertebrate communities following a severe fire in the Lake Tahoe basin, California	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Large and severe wildfires can dramatically alter terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We documented changes in benthic macroinvertebrate communities and physical habitat at two sites along Angora Creek, CA, USA for 2 years following a severe fire. Although post-fire years had low precipitation, canopy cover and bank stability declined dramatically following the wildfire (canopy cover: 88% pre-fire, 22% post-fire; stable bank: 93% pre-fire, 11% post-fire). Substrate also changed substantially, with fine sediment 8x more abundant post-fire and cobble 7x less abundant post-fire. We found no consistent changes in taxonomic richness or diversity following the fire, but post-fire densities and percentage of sensitive taxa were significantly reduced. We observed large reductions in relative abundances of shredder and scraper taxa, while collector-gatherer abundances increased. Community composition shifted away from pre-fire configurations, and continued to diverge in the second year following the fire. Scores from a regionally derived index of biotic integrity (IBI) were variable but overall much lower in post-fire samples and did not show recovery after 2 years. Overall, our study demonstrated substantial post-fire effects to aquatic ecosystems even in the absence of large flooding or scouring events, and showed that these effects can be transmitted downstream into unburned reaches.

Quantitative reconstruction of climatic variations during the Bronze and early Iron ages based on pollen and lake-level data in the NW Alps, France	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Session on Rhythms and Causalities of the Anthropisation Dynamics in Europe between 8500 and 2500 cal BP	SEP, 2006	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	UISPP				Vegetation and lake-level data from the archaeological site of Tresserve, on the eastern shore of Lake Le Bourget (Savoie, France), are used to provide quantitative estimates of climatic variables over the period 4000-2300 cal BP in the northern French Pre-Alps, and to examine the possible impact of climatic changes on societies of the Bronze and early Iron Ages. The results obtained indicate that phases of higher lake level at 3500-3100 and 2750-2350 cal BP coincided with major climate reversals in the North Atlantic area. In west-central Europe, they were marked by cooler and wetter conditions. These two successive events may have affected ancient agricultural communities in west-central Europe by provoking harvest failures, more particularly due to increasing precipitation during the growing season. However, archaeological data in the region of Franche-Comte (Jura Mountains, eastern France) show a general expansion of population density from the middle Bronze Age to the early Iron Age. This suggests a relative emancipation of proto-historic societies from climatic conditions, probably in relation to the spread of new modes of social and economic organisation.

Examination of Factors Contributing to the Decline of the Yellow Perch Population and Fishery in Les Cheneaux Islands, Lake Huron, with Emphasis on the Role of Double-crested Cormorants	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Double-crested cormorants increased exponentially in the Les Cheneaux Islands area during the 1980s and 1990s. The yellow perch fishery and population declined by the late 1990s and finally collapsed in 2000. Previous research confirmed that cormorants fed seasonally on perch. This analysis sought to use creel survey data, and data from an annual gillnet collection to characterize the perch fishery and population during this time so as to explore if declines were a result of declining recruitment or increased mortality or both. Regression analysis explored six possible independent variables to account for yellow perch trends. Yellow perch abundance and its fishery declined throughout the Les Cheneaux Islands. Mean age declined which was consistent with a high mortality rate explanation. Yellow perch recruitment, as indicated by gillnet catch rate of age-2 perch, continued during this time including one very strong year class. Total annual mortality rates determined by the cohort method were as high as 85% during much of this time and increased over the time series. Cormorant abundance accounted for a total of five significant relationships with the yellow perch data, more than any other independent variable. From this, it is apparent that cormorant predation is at least one factor affecting the perch population and fishery and may be the most influential force, among those examined, during this time series.																			0380-1330					SEP	2008	34	3					506	523		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[506:EOFCTT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[506:EOFCTT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000259885100011
J	Behnke, JM				Behnke, J. M.			Structure in parasite component communities in wild rodents: predictability, stability, associations and interactions .... or pure randomness?	PARASITOLOGY												Experimental data establish that interactions exist between species of intestinal helminths during concurrent infections in rodents, the strongest effects being mediated through the host's immune responses. Detecting immune-mediated relationships in wild rodent populations has been fraught with problems and published data do not support a major role for interactions in structuring helminth communities. Helminths in wild rodents show predictable patterns of seasonal, host age-dependent and spatial variation in species richness and in abundance of core species. When these are controlled for, patterns of co-infection compatible with synergistic interactions can be demonstrated. At least one of these, the positive relationship between Heligmosomoides polygyrus and species richness of other helminths has been demonstrated in three totally independent data-sets. Collectively, they explain only a small percentage of the variance/deviance in abundance data and at this level are unlikely to play a major role in structuring helminth communities, although they may be important in the more heavily infected wood mice. Current worm burdens underestimate the possibility that earlier interactions through the immune system have taken place, and therefore interactions may have a greater role to play than is immediately evident from current worm burdens. Longitudinal studies are proposed to resolve this issue.

J	Barathan, BP; Chen, WT; Su, YP; Wang, X; Chen, YX				Barathan, Balaji-Prasath; Chen, Wenting; Su, Yuping; Wang, Xue; Chen, Yinxing			The effects of nutrient loading from different sources on eutrophication in a large shallow lake in Southeast China	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH												Lake water eutrophication has become one of the leading obstacles to sustainable economic development in China. Research on the effects of mainstream currents on reservoirs has been relatively underdeveloped compared with research on tributaries, though changes in the water-sediment transport regime in a downstream river may affect nutrient transport behavior in a lake connected to that river. This is particularly problematic because certain wastewater sources, including runoff from agricultural wastes and industrial discharges, adversely affect lake water. Our study focused on Sanshiliujiao Lake, a significant drinking water source in Fujian, Southeast China, that has suffered considerably from eutrophication over the past few decades. This study aimed to estimate the phosphorus and nitrogen loads to the lake, exploring their sources and their ecologic effects using in situ observation and the export coefficient model. Our results showed that the pollution loads of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were 2.390 and 46.040 t/year, respectively, most of which were derived from the water diversion (TP 45.7%, TN 29.2%) and non-point source (TP 30.2%, TN 41.6%). The TN input was the highest in East river (3.557 kg/d), followed by Red river (2.524 kg/d). During the wet season, the input of TP and TN increased by 14.6 and 18.7 times, respectively, but produced only slight variations in concentration. Water diversion enriched the nutrients inputs and altered the structure and abundance of phytoplankton communities. In addition, when water flows from the main river directly to Sanshiliujiao Lake, algal blooms in river-connected lakes are significantly exacerbated, so our study may also serve as a theoretical basis to regulate eutrophication in Sanshiliujiao Lake.

A series of satellite imagery-based environmental data archives including variations in snow cover, vegetation phenology and lake level were mapped in the Nam Co Lake Basin for the period 2000-2009. Results of the synthesis indicate that throughout this period, the average annual snow cover was 19.87% of the total basin, and there is an obvious relation between the elevation and a clear decreasing southeast-northwest trend in snow-cover persistence. Snow mainly happens from October to May. The multi-year mean water storage of Nam Co Lake is 86.40 x 10(9) m(3), with a lake level increase of approximately 2.06 m during the study period. Vegetation phenology showed obvious variation with advanced start of season (SOS) and slightly extended duration of season (DOS). The mean DOS for the Nam Co Lake Basin was 154 days from 2000 to 2009. Affected by air temperature, the SOS dates coincided with snowmelt. The seasonal-variability of climate factors was also studied. The satellite-derived continuous and multiple datasets offer the advantage of monitoring the temporal and spatial trends of each of these metrics and mapping extensive, remote in mountainous areas with no in-situ data such as represented by the Tibetan Plateau.

Differences in structure and dynamics of Polynucleobacter communities in a temperate and a subtropical lake, revealed at three phylogenetic levels	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The results of ecological studies investigating bacteria by cultivation-independent methods are expected to be influenced by the phylogenetic resolution of the applied molecular tools. This potential influence was investigated in a comparative community study on Polynucleobacter cluster bacteria (Betaproteobacteria) inhabiting the pelagic of the large, shallow, partially hypertrophic Taihu Lake located in subtropical East Asia, and the deep oligo-mesotrophic Lake Mondsee located in temperate Central Europe. The two contrasting habitats were sampled over the same period of 12 months. The community dynamics were investigated at three phylogenetic levels by fluorescent in situ hybridizations with a set of nested probes specific for the beta II clade (including the Polynucleobacter cluster), the genus-like monophyletic Polynucleobacter cluster, and four species-like subclusters. Subcluster B was the numerically dominating subcluster in both lakes over the investigation periods, but demonstrated different population dynamics in the two habitats. Interhabitat comparisons of the Polynucleobacter community structure in the two lakes in the study, and a previously investigated acidic pond indicated ecological diversification within the phylogenetically narrow Polynucleobacter cluster. These results could be obtained by help of the subcluster-specific probes, but would have been missed with probes of a lower phylogenetic resolution.

J	Burbridge, RE; Mayle, FE; Killeen, TJ				Burbridge, RE; Mayle, FE; Killeen, TJ			Fifty-thousand-year vegetation and climate history of Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, Bolivian Amazon	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen and charcoal records from two large, shallow lakes reveal that throughout most of the past 50,000 yr Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, in northeastern lowland Bolivia (southwestern Amazon Basin), was predominantly covered by savannas and seasonally dry semideciduous forests. Lowered atmospheric CO2 concentrations, in combination with a longer dry season, caused expansion of dry forests and savannas during the last glacial period, especially at the last glacial maximum. These ecosystems persisted until the mid-Holocene, although they under-went significant species reassortment. Forest communities containing a mixture of evergreen and semideciduous species began to expand between 6000 and 3000 C-14 yr B.P. Humid evergreen rain forests expanded to cover most of the area within the past 2000 14C yr B.P., coincident with a reduction in fire frequencies. Comparisons between modem pollen spectra and vegetation reveal that the Moraceae-dominated rain forest pollen spectra likely have a regional source area at least 2-3 km beyond the lake shore, whereas the grass and sedge-dominated savanna pollen spectra likely have a predominantly local source area. The Holocene vegetation changes are consistent with independent paleoprecipitation records from the Bolivian Altiplano and paleovegetation records from other parts of southwestern Amazonia. The progressive expansion in rain forests through the Holocene can be largely attributed to enhanced convective activity over Amazonia, due to greater seasonality of insolation in the Southern Hemisphere tropics driven by the precession cycle according to the Milankovitch Astronomical Theory.

Recently, abundant silicified wood specimens were found in the central Sichuan Basin, but no plant foliage fossils have been recorded from the same strata. Here, we report the first leafy shoot fossils collected from the red beds of the Upper Jurassic Penglaizhen Formation in Shehong City, central Sichuan Basin. Based on careful comparisons with potential Mesozoic conifer fossils, they were assigned to Pagiophyllum, an extinct conifer taxon of the family Cheirolepidicaceae. The generic classification agreed with the palaeovegetation features of the Penglaizhen Formation which were represented by gymnosperms of Araucariaceae (Agathoxylon-type wood) and Cheirolepidiaceae (Brachyoxylon-type wood). The non-coexistence between the leafy shoot fossil and the petrified wood depicted a unique process of fossil preservation, which may be related to the palaeo-flood events in this area. The palaeoclimate background during the Late Jurassic of Shehong was suggested to be a hot and semi-arid or arid condition, supported by the Classopollis-dominated (75-90%) pollen assemblage from the Penglaizhen Formation. The fossil foliage was collected from lacustrine or fluvial sediments. This suggests that the rainy season is a key factor in the development of regional lakes or rivers and flood events, which offered a suitable local environment for plant growth and helped construct a more complex ecological system, allowing a variety of creatures to survive in the central Sichuan Basin area.					; Tian, Ning/OML-5576-2025; Zhang, Li/KEJ-3247-2024; Cui, Yiming/AAZ-1438-2021; Xie, Xiaoping/HHY-7662-2022	Zhang, Li/0000-0002-7335-4980; 													0072-1050	1099-1034				APR	2022	57	4					1628	1637		10.1002/gj.4364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gj.4364		DEC 2021											WOS:000733712800001

This study aimed at identifying and evaluating macroinvertebrate community-based metrics that best respond to degradation due to urban pollution in riverine systems of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Data (physicochemical variables and macroinvertebrate specimens) were collected from 17 sites over 3 seasons. The sites were selected across an impairment gradient comprising less impacted, moderately impacted and heavily impacted sites. Heavily impacted sites had the highest levels of total dissolved solids, conductivity, salinity, turbidity, total phosphates, total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand and sedimentary zinc. Dissolved oxygen was significantly highest in less impacted sites. Sensitivity of 24 macroinvertebrate metrics to this impairment gradient were assessed. A total of 5 metrics were identified as sensitive to modifications in water quality due to urban pollution.

The evaporation level changes that occur in middle-large-sized lakes (surface area > 50 km(2)) in the area directly influence the regional mass and energy balance values, atmospheric boundary layer heat and humidity structures, and weather processes occurring in the lower-reach areas. The studies conducted in the literature at present, concerning lake evaporation processes, generally overlook the differences in lake heat storage behavior due to the reduced amount of data in the literature concerning lake bathymetry. According to the in situ bathymetric data obtained for 68 middle-large-sized lakes in the inner basin of the TP, in this study, we calculated their heat storage (G) change values by using the different vertical-depth water-temperature-change integral method, and we established a regression equation for the heat storage and lake surface net radiation values for 68 lakes. The evaporation rates of 134 middle-large-sized lakes larger than 50 km(2) in the inland are of the TP were calculated by obtaining the G regression result and adopting it into the Penman model, as well as estimating the evaporation losses of theses 134 lakes from 2002 to 2018. The result shows that the annual average evaporation rate for these lakes is 927.39 mm/year, with an insignificant upward trend (0.10 mm/year). This method achieved good accuracy compared with the Bowen ratio method, which estimates the evaporation rate during the ice-free season, with a high correlation coefficient (R) value of 0.95 and least root mean square error (RMSE) value of 61 mm. The annual mean evaporation rate can be divided into the southern and northern lake groups along a 34 & DEG;N line with a difference of 314.41 mm/year. The annual average evaporation volume of these lakes was 25.02 km(3) and showed an upward trend of 0.35 km(3)/year. Among them, the annual average evaporation volume contribution ratio of level-1 lakes (50 km(2) & LE; lake's area < 100 km(2), 61 lakes) was 14.04%, showing an upward trend, and the contribution of level-3 lakes (lake's area & GE; 500 km(2), 10 lakes) was 41.50%, showing a downward trend. There were no obvious changes in the level-2 lakes (100 km(2) & LE; lake's area < 500 km(2), 63 lakes), which maintained at the same level in approximately 44.46%. Air temperature is the most important factor affecting the evaporation rate of lakes, while the lake surface area is the main factor affecting lake evaporation volume. Our study, considering the actual lake heat storage value, provides a useful reference for further improving lake water budget balance values and watershed hydrologic features in the inland closed lakes located in the TP.

J	Fayne, JV; Smith, LC				Fayne, Jessica V.; Smith, Laurence C.			How Does Wind Influence Near-Nadir and Low-Incidence Ka-Band Radar Backscatter and Coherence from Small Inland Water Bodies?	REMOTE SENSING												While many studies have been conducted regarding wind-driven Ka-band scattering on the ocean and sea surfaces, few have identified the impacts of Ka-band scattering on small inland water bodies, and fewer have identified the influence of wind on coherence over water. These previous studies have been limited in spatial scale, covering only large water bodies >25 km(2). The recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission is the first Ka-band InSAR satellite designed for mapping water surface elevations and open water areas for rivers as narrow as 100 m and lakes as small as 0.0625 km(2). Because measurements of these types are novel, there remains some uncertainty about expected backscatter amplitudes given wind-driven water surface roughness variability. A previous study using the airborne complement to SWOT, AirSWOT, found that low backscatter and low coherence values were indicative of higher errors in the water surface elevation products, recommending minimum thresholds for backscatter and coherence for filtering the data to increase the accuracy of averaged data for lakes and rivers. We determined that the global average wind speed over lakes is 4 m/s, and after comparing AirSWOT backscatter and coherence data with ERA-5 wind speeds, we found that the minimum required speed to retrieve high backscatter and coherence is 3 m/s. We examined 11,072 lakes across Canada and Alaska, with sizes ranging from 350 m(2) to 156 km(2), significantly smaller than what could be measured with previous Ka-band instruments in orbit. We found that small lakes (0.0625-0.25 km(2)) have significantly lower backscatter (3-5 dB) and 0.20-0.25 lower coherence than larger lakes (>1 km(2)). These results suggest that approximately 75% of SWOT observable lake areas around the globe will have consistently high-accuracy water surface elevations, though seasonal wind variability should remain an important consideration. Despite very small lakes presenting lower average backscatter and coherence, this study asserts that SWOT will be able to accurately resolve the water surface elevations and water surface extents for significantly smaller water bodies than have been previously recorded from satellite altimeters. This study additionally lays the foundation for future high-resolution inland water wind speed studies using SWOT data, when the data become available, as the relationships between wind speed and Ka-band backscatter reflect those of traditional scatterometers designed for oceanic studies.

Characteristics of the soil macropore and root architecture of alpine meadows during the seasonal freezing-thawing process and their impact on water transport in the Qinghai Lake watershed, northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Low temperatures, freezing-thawing cycles, and short growing seasons character-ize alpine soils. The mattic epipedon, a special diagnostic surface horizon with an intensive root network, is widely distributed in alpine ecosystems. Studies on the soil macropores and roots of the mattic epipedon layer in response to seasonal freezing-thawing processes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are lacking. This study characterized the soil macropores and roots of alpine meadows during the seasonal freezing-thawing process using X-ray computed tomog-raphy and revealed the influence of soil macropores and roots structure on water transport in the mattic epipedon layer of the alpine meadows. The results showed that the soil pore distri-bution was more uniform during the unstable freezing stage (UFP) and the unstable thawing stage (UTP), whereas there was a clear mattic epipedon layer during the completely thawed stage (TP) and the completely frozen stage (FP). Soils in the TP stage had a higher total sur-face area density (0.1898 mm2 mm-3), length density (225.28 mm mm-3), node density (1,592 no. mm-3), and connectivity (0.3144) of soil macropores than those in the UFP, UTP, and FP stages. In the TP stages, the density, surface area density, branch density, length density, and node density of roots had significant correlations with the macroporosity, surface area density, length density, node density, and tortuosity of soil macropores. In the FP stage, there were no correlations between the root and soil macropore characteristics. Vertical water is expected to move more readily through the mattic epipedon in the TP stage than in the UFP and UTP stages. Roots were the preferential pathways for water transport into the soil layer of the alpine meadow. Therefore, the mattic epipedon is a key layer for water and nutrient storage and plays an important role in the water-holding function of the Tibetan Plateau due to its greater root development.

A recently established Kelp Gull colony in a freshwater environment supported by an inland refuse dump in Patagonia	EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY												Populations of several species of gull are increasing worldwide as a result of a plentiful supply of anthropogenic food in urbanised environments. In light of this, we decided to examine the importance of anthropogenic food in the diet of a recently established colony of Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus). Wecollected 241 regurgitated pellets of the Kelp Gull during the 2008-09 breeding season at the colony in the De La Guardia Islands, Nahuel Huapi Lake, Argentina. In terms of percentage frequency of occurrence in pellets, human refuse (65.6%) was the most frequently recorded item, followed by insects (42.3%; mostly coleopterans) and fish (21.2%). In terms of the percentage number of total prey items, insects (62.1%) and human refuse (21.3%) were the most abundant items. The consumption of insects decreased and that of human refuse increased during chick-rearing. Human refuse was recorded in samples from most nests (97.3%). We compare our results with those obtained for other localities and discuss the consequences of the management of urban refuse. Our results suggest that the Kelp Gull breeding colony in the De La Guardia Islands is sustained by the availability of food from the rubbish tip of Villa la Angostura. This is the first dietary study of the Kelp Gull in a continental freshwater ecosystem and one more example of a gull colony supported by anthropogenic sources of food.					; Frixione, Martín/ABK-3732-2022	Villanueva, Cecilia/0000-0001-9694-3131; Alarcon, Pablo A.

These changes on decadal timescales have been well documented. Here we identify how the glacier responds to forcings on shorter timescales, such as from variations in surface melt, the drainage of supraglacial lakes and seasonal fluctuations in terminus position. Ice motion and surface melt were monitored intermittently from 2006 to 2008. Dual-frequency GPS were deployed 20-50 km upstream of the terminus along the glacier center line. Gaps in surface melt measurements were filled using a temperature-index model of ablation driven by surface air temperatures recorded during the same time period. Our results corroborate the premise that the primary factors controlling speeds on Jakobshavn Isbrae are terminus position and geometry. We also observe that surface speeds demonstrate a complex relationship with meltwater input: on diurnal timescales, velocities closely match changes in water input; however, on seasonal timescales a longer, more intense melt season was observed to effectively reduce the overall ice flow of the glacier for the whole year.					; Fahnestock, Mark/N-2678-2013; Joughin, Ian/A-2998-2008; Cassotto, Ryan/HJI-4741-2023	Cassotto, Ryan/0000-0003-3206-6744; Truffer, Martin/0000-0001-8251-7043; Joughin, Ian/0000-0001-6229-679X; 													0022-1430						2012	58	212					1212	1226		10.3189/2012JoG12J065	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2012JoG12J065													WOS:000312479400016

The results obtained were complemented by published data from 13 other Chinese lakes. These lakes are located across large temperature and precipitation gradients, therefore allowing for an assessment of the distribution pattern of LCK and their temperature dependency. Different distribution patterns of LCK (C-37 predominant pattern and C-38 predominant pattern) were detected in the surface sediment samples. The ratio of C-37:4 methyl ketone to the sum of C-37 alkenones observed in the different lakes is highly variable (5%-96%, with mean value of 55%), and more than that seen in marine systems. The finding that some of the ocean LCK precursor algae (Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Coccolithus pelagicus) were also present in the limnic systems suggested that both systems might have similar biosynthetic sources. Empirical relationships between the alkenone unsaturation index U-37(k') and different temperature sets (mean annual air temperature, mean annual air temperature in different seasons, and lake surface water temperature of July) were tested. The best correlation between U-37(k') and temperature was obtained using mean annual air temperature. A general linear regression of U-37(k') and MAAT can be expressed as U-37(k') = 0.0328 x T + 0.126 (n = 38, r(2) = 0.83). Although questions such as species-uncertainty and other unknown factors for U-37(k') temperature dependence still remain, the equation might be representative of the average contribution of LCK to sediments for these data over a wide range of surface temperatures, water chemistry and different alkenones-producer algal populations. The general relationship of U-37(k'), and mean annual air temperature is consistent with that in marine systems. It supports the suggestion that the biosynthetic pathway of alkenones and the mechanism of their temperature signal may be similar in both marine and limnic systems. LCK might be used as an important paleotemperalure proxy in limnic environment.

The history of subaquatic volcanism recorded in the sediments of Lake Kivu; East Africa	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Subaquatic volcanic activity has been ongoing in Lake Kivu since the early Holocene and has a dynamic effect on the biological productivity in the surface water, and the preservation of carbonate in the deep anoxic water. Groundwater discharge into the lake's deepwater propels the upward advection of the water column that ultimately supplies nutrients to the surface water for biological production. The amount of nutrients supplied from the deepwater can be increased suddenly by (1) a cold meteorological event that drives deep seasonal mixing resulting in increased nutrients from below and oxygen from above, or (2) subaquatic volcanic activity that induces a buoyant hydrothermal plume, which entrains nutrients from the deepwater and results in anoxia or suboxic conditions in the surface water. Previous sedimentological studies in Lake Kivu have hypothesized that regional climatic changes are responsible for sudden changes in the preservation of carbonates in the Main Basin. Here we reveal that sublacustrine volcanic events most likely induce the abrupt changes to the geochemistry in the sediment in Lake Kivu. An unprecedented look into the sediment stratigraphy and geochemistry from high-resolution seismic-reflection, and -isotope analyses was conducted in the Main Basin. The results reveal that buoyant hydrothermal plumes caused by subaquatic volcanic activity are a possible trigger for increased biological productivity and organic matter preservation, and that ongoing hydrothermal activity increases the alkalinity in the deepwater, leading to carbonate preservation. The onset of carbonate preservation since the 1970s that is currently observed in the sediment could indicate that hydrothermal discharge has recently increased in the lake.

People living around Lake Chilwa rely on the lake for their water supply. From May 2009 to May 2010, a cholera outbreak occurred in fishing communities around Lake Chilwa. This paper describes the outbreak response and lessons learned for prevention and management of future outbreaks. Methods Starting in January 2010, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) helped District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) to distribute educational materials, water disinfectant and hygiene supplies, and oral rehydration solution (ORS) in fishing communities. MSF also supported case management by mentoring health workers and providing equipment and supplies. Results A total of 1,171 cholera cases and 21 deaths were reported in the districts around the lake, with cases also being reported on the Mozambican side of the lake. The attack rate was highest among people living on or around the lake, particularly among fishermen. Samples of lake water had high turbidity conducive to the propagation of Vibrio cholerae. Conclusion A number of practical measures could be taken to prevent future outbreaks and to manage outbreaks more effectively. These measures should address surveillance, environmental management, outbreak preparedness, and case management.																			1995-7262					JUN	2012	24	2					29	33											23638267					WOS:000306601700003

We measured NDVI across long-term experimental treatments in wet sedge tundra at the Toolik Lake LTER site, in northern Alaska. Over 13 years, N and P were applied in factorial experiments (N, P and N + P), air temperature was increased using greenhouses with and without N + P fertilizer, and light intensity (photosynthetically active photon flux density) was reduced by 50% using shade cloth. Within each treatment plot, NDVI, aboveground biomass and whole-system CO,! flux measurements were made at the same sampling points during the peak-growing season of 2001. We, found that across all treatments, NDVI is correlated with aboveground biomass (r(2)=0.84), GEP (r(2)=0.75) and ER (r(2)=0.71), providing a basis for linking remotely sensed NDVI to aboveground biomass and ecosystem carbon flux.					; Gamon, John/A-2641-2014; Gamon, John/AHB-1738-2022; Griffin, Kevin/B-2629-2013; boelman, natalie/K-9789-2015	Boelman, Natalie/0000-0003-3716-2372; Griffin, Kevin/0000-0003-4124-3757; Gamon, John/0000-0002-8269-7723; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				MAY	2003	135	3					414	421		10.1007/s00442-003-1198-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-003-1198-3								12721832					WOS:000183198000013

An organic carbon budget for an Amazon floodplain lake	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 30, PT 8, PROCEEDINGS: NOW: INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF LIMNOLOGY	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY - PROCEEDINGS				30th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	AUG 12-18, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol				Examination of carbon dynamics in lakes has a long and rich history (RIEMANN & SONDERGAARD 1986, WETZEL 2001). As concerns about climate change have intensified, the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle has received renewed attention and has been found to be disproportionately important relative to the area occupied (COLE et al. 2007). While ALIN & JOHNSON (2007) provide a useful summary of production, burial, and lake-atmosphere exchange for large lakes, the number of small lakes in many geographic settings and their cumulative area indicates the necessity of similar analyses for these waters (DOWNING et al. 2006). The fringing floodplain along the 2600 km reach of the Amazon River in Brazil contains about 6500 lakes; this seasonally inundated area includes up to about 80 000 km(2) of flooded forests, open water, and floating macrophytes (SIPPEL et al. 1991, 1998, HESS et al. 2003). These habitats out-gas significant amounts of carbon dioxide and methane as a result of carbon fixation on the floodplain and inputs from neighboring uplands (RICHEY et al. 2002, MELACK et al. 2004). However, the relative importance of aquatic versus terrestrial sources of carbon has significant implications for the regional carbon balance and remains uncertain. Based on our measurements and those of others, we have assembled sufficient data to characterize most of the fluxes and transformations of carbon in a representative central Amazon flood-plain lake (Fig. 1). These results allow quantitative evaluation of the relative importance of aquatic and terrestrial sources of carbon to flood-plain emission of greenhouse gases.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54079-2				2009	30		8				1179	1182																WOS:000274244900004

Support of benthic invertebrates by detrital resources and current autochthonous primary production:: results from a whole-lake 13C addition	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Secondary production of benthic invertebrates in lakes is supported by current autochthonous primary production, and by detritus derived from a combination of terrestrial inputs and old autochthonous production from prior seasons. We quantified the importance of these two resources for the dominant benthic insects in Crampton Lake, a 26 ha, clear-water system. 2. Daily additions of (NaHCO3)-C-13 to the lake caused an increase in the stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) of the current primary production of phytoplankton and periphyton. We measured the response of four insect groups (taxon-depth combinations) to this manipulation, quantifying their current autochthony (% reliance on current autochthonous primary production) by fitting dynamic mixing models to time series of insect delta C-13. 3. The delta C-13 of all four groups increased in response to the manipulation, although the magnitude of response differed by taxon and by depth, indicating differences in current autochthony. Odonate larvae (Libellulidae and Corduliidae) collected at 1.5 m depth derived 75% of their C from current autochthonous primary production. Chironomid larvae collected at 1.5, 3.5 and 10 m depths derived, respectively, 43%, 39% and 17% of their C from current autochthonous primary production. 4. Both taxon-specific diet preferences and depth-specific differences in resource availability may contribute to differences in current autochthony. Our results demonstrate significant but incomplete support of insect production by current autochthony, and indicate that allochthonous inputs and old autochthonous detritus support a substantial fraction (25-83%) of insect production.

Stochastic simulation model for nonstationary time series using an autoregressive wavelet decomposition: Applications to rainfall and temperature	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												[1] A time series simulation scheme based on wavelet decomposition coupled to an autoregressive model is presented for hydroclimatic series that exhibit band-limited low-frequency variability. Many nonlinear dynamical systems generate time series that appear to have amplitude- and frequency-modulated oscillations that may correspond to the recurrence of different solution regimes. The use of wavelet decomposition followed by an autoregressive model of each leading component is explored as a model for such time series. The first example considered is the Lorenz-84 low-order model of extratropical circulation, which has been used to illustrate how chaos and intransitivity ( multiple stable solutions) can lead to low-frequency variability. The central England temperature (CET) time series, the NINO3.4 series that is a surrogate for El Nino - Southern Oscillation, and seasonal rainfall from Everglades National Park, Florida, are then modeled with this approach. The proposed simulation model yields better results than a traditional linear autoregressive (AR) time series model in terms of reproducing the time-frequency properties of the observed rainfall, while preserving the statistics usually reproduced by the AR models.

In response to elevated water levels, barrier beach-ridges located on the eastern shore of the Point Pelee foreland, in the Lake Erie's central basin, experienced accelerated erosion including overwash and breaching, removal or burial of vegetation, and damage to infrastructure and sensitive habitat. Historical aerial imagery between 1931 and 2020 and annual average lake levels between 1920 and 2020 were examined to characterize barrier retreat and breach initiation, expansion, and closure. Results indicate that the barriers have transgressed at a rate of >1 m y-1, but the rate of transgression and progradation, overwash, and breaching are dependent on decadal-scale variations in water level. Ephemeral breaches and delta deposits were found to be a significant source of landward sediment transport if breaches remained open for multiple years. This may represent a self-reinforcing cycle that promotes breach fill-in processes, even during high lake levels, and increases the barrier width and resiliency in response to further lake level fluctuations. While common patterns of barrier dynamics were found throughout the time series, human impacts may modify historic barrier transgression rates and breach and recovery processes.

J	Gessesse, GD; Mansberger, R; Klik, A				Gessesse, Gizaw Desta; Mansberger, Reinfried; Klik, Andreas			Assessment of Rill Erosion Development during Erosive Storms at Angereb Watershed, Lake Tana Sub-basin in Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Application of simple and locally based erosion assessment methods that fit to the local condition is necessary to improve the performance and efficiency of soil conservation practices. In this study, rill erosion formation and development was investigated on the topo-sequence of three catchments (300-500 m slope length); and on agricultural fields (6 m and 14 m slope lengths) with different crop-tillage surfaces during erosive storms. Rill density and rill erosion rates were measured using rill cross section survey and close range digital photogrammetry. Rill formation and development was commonly observed on conditions where there is wider terrace spacing, concave slope shapes and unstable stone terraces on steep slopes. At field plot level, rill development was controlled by the distribution and abrupt change in the soil surface roughness and extent of slope length. At catchment scale, however, rill formation and development was controlled by landscape structures, and concavity and convexity of the slope. Greater rill cross sections and many small local rills were associated to the rougher soil surfaces. For instance, relative comparison of crop tillage practices have showed that faba-bean tillage management was more susceptible to seasonal rill erosion followed by Teff and wheat tillage surfaces under no cover condition. Surface roughness and landscape structures played a net decreasing effect on the parallel rill network development. This implies that spatial and temporal variability of the rill prone areas was strongly associated with the nature and initial size of surface micro-topography or tillage roughness. Thus, it is necessary to account land management practices, detail micro-topographic surfaces and landscape structures for improved prediction of rill prone areas under complex topographic conditions. Application of both direct rill cross section survey and close range digital photogrammetric techniques could enhance field erosion assessment for practical soil conservation improvement.

The Lake Chad area population is increasing, resulting in competition for scarce land and water resources. For the first time, the density of people and animals from mobile and sedentary populations was assessed using randomly defined sampling areas. Four sampling rounds were conducted over two years in the same areas to show population density dynamics. We identified 42 villages of sedentary communities in the sampling zones; 11 (in 2010) and 16 (in 2011) mobile pastoralist camps at the beginning of the dry season and 34 (in 2011) and 30 (in 2012) camps at the end of the dry season. A mean of 64.0 people per km(2) (95% confidence interval, 20.3-107.8) were estimated to live in sedentary villages. In the mobile communities, we found 5.9 people per km(2) at the beginning and 17.5 people per km(2) at the end of the dry season. We recorded per km(2) on average 21.0 cattle and 31.6 small ruminants in the sedentary villages and 66.1 cattle and 102.5 small ruminants in the mobile communities, which amounts to a mean of 86.6 tropical livestock units during the dry season. These numbers exceed, by up to five times, the published carrying capacities for similar Sahelian zones. Our results underline the need for a new institutional framework. Improved land use management must equally consider the needs of mobile communities and sedentary populations.					; Mahamat, Abdraman/NES-1473-2025; Schelling, Esther/K-7990-2015; Zinsstag, Jakob/A-8317-2008	Crump, Lisa/0000-0002-4406-0238; Eckert, Sandra/0000-0002-9579-5680; Zinsstag, Jakob/0000-0002-8899-6097; 													1827-1987	1970-7096					2015	10	1					6	12		10.4081/gh.2015.307	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/gh.2015.307								26054513					WOS:000356615300002

Both wetlands are formed by the evaporitic remnant basins of paleolakes which occupied an extensive area of what today is known as the Altiplano. These systems have a negative hydrological balance, receiving their water from groundwater, snow melt and limited seasonal rains. An ongoing negative water balance and the sediment characteristics in the region have accelerated the salinization process in these systems, as shown by their present physicochemical characteristics. Nutrient values were typical of mesotrophic to eutrophic systems. The ionic content classifies Lirima as a sodium sulfated wetland and Caya as a calcium chloride one. Conductivity values ranged between 778 mu S/cm at Lirima to 2100 mu S/cm at Caya, and were reflected in the differences in biodiversity found in these systems. The Lirima wetland supports a population of the endemic fish Orestias aff. agassii found in several Evolutionary Significant Units (ESU) across the region. Microbial diversity in the water column was characterized by the presence of 5 bacterial phyla and related genera (e.g. Psychrobacter, Bacillus, Eiyhtobacter, Halomonas). We present information on several key ecosystem components including macrophytes, plankton, benthos, fish and birds. This descriptive paper highlights the unusual limnological and biological characteristics of high altitude wetlands and highlights the importance of describing their biological communities across levels of organisation (e.g. microbial through to higher vertebrates) as well as their functional role, interactions and sensitivity to changes in water availability.

We conducted a lab experiment to examine the influence of a late-season temperature increase on growth, biomass allocation, and acclimation of 2 submerged macrophyte species, Elodea canadensis and Potamogeton crispus. We also ran competitive interaction experiments between the 2 species with mono-and mixed-species cultures in pots placed in outdoor heated mesocosms (5 years at ambient temperature and a higher temperature following the IPCC A2 scenario downscaled to local conditions but enhanced by 50%). In the lab, macrophytes collected in the 2 types of mesocosms were grown at ambient temperatures (12 degrees C in September and 8 degrees C in October) and 4 degrees C higher. Warming had an overall stronger effect on E. candensis than P. crispus, particularly within the low temperature range studied. Hence, the relative growth rate (RGR) of E. canadensis acclimated to ambient mesocosm conditions increased 6-fold from low (8 degrees C) to high (16 degrees C) temperature, whereas the RGR of P. crispus increased <2-fold. In the competitive interaction experiment, warming increased the biomass and RGR of E. canadensis in the monoculture. In addition, warming increased shoot elongation of the plant in both the monoculture and mixed culture. P. crispus was generally unaffected by warming when grown in both monoculture and mixed culture, but competition decreased the elongation of shoots pre-adapted to ambient conditions and grown in the warmer mesocosms. The decomposition rate of E. canadensis accelerated with warming but was unaffected in P. crispus. We conclude that E. canadensis is a stronger competitor than P. crispus under warmer late-season conditions; however, it may have a higher demand for oxygen due to the increased decomposition rates at higher temperatures, particularly in the peripheral growing season, with potential profound effects on lake ecosystems. Although acclimatisation was evident, we suggested that temperature changes will affect the growth pattern of the 2 plant species and thereby perhaps induce a switch in macrophyte species dominance.

When this glacier advances through the waters Lago Argentino and reaches the Peninsula de Magallanes (PM), it has been regularly producing an ice-dam between the Brazo Rico (BR) and Canal de los Tempanos (CT-LA) since the early twentieth century; the last registered episode was in February 2016. Using the Advance-Close-Open-Retreat (ACOR) concept, we analyze the oscillation cycle of GPM, the feedback mechanism. From limnimetric scales observations during the 1994-2015 time period, it can be demonstrated that GPM exhibits different behaviors during the charge and discharge processes, classified by three types of outburst: sudden, progressive, and minor. The maximum discharge rate of a sudden event goes up to 8000 m(3) s(-1), while a minor event may be as low as 123 m(3) s(-1). To obtain detailed shape information of ice-dam formation at high temporal resolution, daily time-lapse images were acquired by two professional DSLR cameras from April 2012 to April 2013. The daily data allows for accurate estimation of the position and its rate of change in the terminus area of the glacier where the ice-dam develops, including the estimation of the height and width of the drainage tunnel forming at the base of the icedam. The glacier is advancing between June and December, and retreating between December and April. Based on the time-lapse image measurements, the forward and retreat motion of the glacier was estimated to be 0.53 m day(-1) and - 1.1 m day(-1) with an estimation error of +/- 0.04 m day(-1) between April to October (2012) and January and April (2013), respectively. The seasonal variation in the position of the glacier was found to be +/- 65 m in this period. The results obtained by the methods and techniques implemented have clearly demonstrate that the annual advance of the glacier front typically leads to an ice-dam formation, which is a complex process, and there is a feedback mechanism between GPM and LA that primarily controls the oscillations of the glacier front around the otherwise quite stable position.					; Falaschi, Daniel/JKH-6520-2023	Lenzano, Maria Gabriela/0000-0001-8033-9183; Lo Vecchio, Andres/0000-0002-3606-9160; Falaschi, Daniel/0000-0001-9232-2813													0165-232X	1872-7441				FEB	2018	146						155	166		10.1016/j.coldregions.2017.11.015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2017.11.015													WOS:000423963300017

Star Carr is arguably the richest, most studied and re-interpreted Mesolithic site in Europe but the lack of fish remains has continued to vex scholars. Judging from other materials, the preservation conditions at the site in the late 1940s/early 1950s should have been good enough to permit the survival of fish remains, and particularly dentaries of the northern pike (Esox lucius L., 1758) as found on other European sites of this age. The lack of evidence has therefore been attributed to a paucity of fish in the lake. However, new research has provided multiple lines of evidence, which not only demonstrate the presence of fish, but also provide evidence for the species present, data on how and where fish were being processed on site, and interpretations for the fishing methods that might have been used. This study demonstrates that an integrated approach using a range of methods at landscape, site and microscopic scales of analysis can elucidate such questions. In addition, it demonstrates that in future studies, even in cases where physical remains are lacking, forensic techniques hold significant potential. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abrupt changes were detected by the heuristic segmentation method. Possible causes of the hydrological changes were investigated considering climate changes and human activities (especially the reservoir operation and irrigation extension). The Mann-Kendall method was applied to estimate whether the temperature and precipitation were changed. The increased temperature and the decreased precipitation in the flood season may decrease the runoff. At the middle reaches, the impact of the reservoir is significant and may be the main factor leading to the abrupt decreases in annual runoff and its intra-annual variability and concentration. The increased water surface area of the reservoir aggravates the evaporation and leads to annual runoff reduction. The reservoir regulates runoff by storing water in the flood season and releasing water in the dry season.

Airborne hyper-spectral scanners offer higher potential than satellite sensors for wetland monitoring and assessment. However, application in remote areas is often limited by national restrictions, time and high costs compared to satellite data. In this study, we tested the potential of the commercial, high-resolution multi-spectral satellite QuickBird for monitoring littoral zones of Lake Sevan (Armenia). We present a classification procedure that uses a physics-based image processing system (MIP) and GIS tools for calculating spatial metrics. We focused on classification of littoral sediment coverage over three consecutive years (2006-2008) to document changes in vegetation structure associated with a rise in water levels. We describe a spectral unmixing algorithm for basic classification and a supervised algorithm for mapping vegetation types. Atmospheric aerosol retrieval, lake-specific parameterisation and validation of classifications were supported by underwater spectral measurements in the respective seasons. Results revealed accurate classification of submersed aquatic vegetation and sediment structures in the littoral zone, documenting spatial vegetation dynamics induced by water level fluctuations and inter-annual variations in phytoplankton blooms. The data prove the cost-effective applicability of satellite remote-sensing approaches for high-resolution mapping in space and time of lake littoral zones playing a major role in lake ecosystem functioning. Such approaches could be used for monitoring wetlands anywhere in the world.

The water samples and benthic macroinvertebrates were collected in 22 sampling sites during the rainy and dry seasons. In each lagoon DO, DTS, EC, temperature and pH were determined in situ. The results revealed that the physicochemical parameters comply with the environmental quality standards for water, except COD and BOD5. In the PCA of the physicochemical parameters, the first two axes explained 73% of the total variation. The gradual analysis in pairs showed significant differences. The SIMPER analysis determined an average of four families of benthic macroinvertebrates per lagoon that showed more than 70% contribution. The ANOSIM revealed that Tragadero lagoon differs significantly from the others. The DistLM showed a value of 0.46 of coefficient of determination. Therefore, the quality of the environment of high Andean lagoons evaluated by means of multivariate statistical methods presents important differences or dissimilarities not only in the physicochemical characteristics of the water, but also in the composition of the benthic macroinvertebrate communities.					; Peñaloza-Fernandez, Richard/AAZ-5988-2021; YARANGA CANO, Raul/AEA-5374-2022; Custodio, Maria/E-3906-2019; Custodio, María/E-3906-2019	Yaranga, Raul/0000-0001-8903-6293; CHANAME ZAPATA, FERNAN COSME/0000-0002-2059-8308; Penaloza, Richard/0000-0001-9848-1815; Penaloza, Richard/0000-0003-3160-9268; Custodio, Maria/0000-0003-1994-010X; 													2299-8993					NOV	2018	19	6					24	33		10.12911/22998993/92677	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/92677													WOS:000446231500003
J	Serur, AB; Sarma, AK				Serur, Abdulkerim Bedewi; Sarma, Arup Kumar			Climate change impacts analysis on hydrological processes in the Weyib River basin in Ethiopia	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The study aims to examine the variation of hydrological processes (in terms of mean annual, seasonal, and monthly) under changing climate within the Weyib River basin in Ethiopia at both basin and sub-basin level using ArcSWAT hydrologic model. The climate change impacts on temperature and precipitation characteristics within the basin have been studied using GFDL-ESM2M, CanESM2, and GFDL-ESM2G models for RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 scenarios from coupled model inter-comparison project 5 (CMIP5) which have been downscaled by SDSM. The results revealed that the mean annual temperature and precipitation reveal a statistically significant (at 5% significant level) increasing trend in the nine ESM-RCP scenarios for all the future time slices. The mean annual actual evapotranspiration, baseflow, soil water content, percolation, and water availability in the stream exhibit a rise for all the ESMs-RCP scenarios in the entire basin and in all the sub-basins. However, surface runoff and potential evapotranspiration show a decreasing trend. The mean annual water availability increases between 9.18 and 27.97% (RCP8.5), 3.98 and 19.61% (RCP4.5), and 11.82 and 17.06% (RCP2.6) in the entire basin. The sub-basin level analysis reveals that the annual, seasonal, and monthly variations of hydrological processes in all the sub-basins are similar regarding direction but different in magnitude as compared to that of the entire basin analysis. In addition, it is observed that there is a larger monthly and seasonal variation in hydrological processes as compared to the variation in annual scale. The net water availability tends to decline in the dry season; this might cause water shortage in the lowland region and greater increases in an intermediate and rainy seasons; this might cause flooding to some flood prone region of the basin. Since the variation of water availability among the sub-basins in upcoming period is high, there is a scope of meeting agriculture water demand through water transfer from sub-basin having more available water in small area to the sub-basin having less available water in a larger agricultural area.

J	Zhao, R; Reckhow, DA; Becker, WC; Schindler, S				Zhao, Ran; Reckhow, David A.; Becker, William C.; Schindler, Steven			Seasonal Variation of Disinfection Byproduct Precursors in a Large Water Supply	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION												Disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors originate in large reservoirs from at least three types of sources: (1) watershed or allochthonous, (2) algal or autochthonous, and (3) bottom sediments or benthic. The properties of the bulk natural organic matter (NOM) and the DBP precursor content of that NOM are unique to each source. Knowledge about the relative importance of these three sources would be valuable in understanding the natural variability in DBP precursor occurrence and in managing source waters for the purpose of minimizing DBP precursors. In this study, we used temporal and spatial water quality data from a drinking water reservoir to shed light on autochthonous and benthic sources of NOM and DBP precursors. The Cannonsville Reservoir (New York) was chosen for this work because of its well-documented water quality. To assist in the data analysis, we developed a series of two-dimensional contour plots that bring clarity to benthic and near-surface (algal) processes on water quality. Combining conventional water quality parameters with DBP precursor analysis can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of limnological factors that define DBP precursor levels. These data were compared with known properties of NOM and related natural biochemical parameters. From this analysis, we conclude that algal-dominated NOM contributes disproportionately to dihaloacetonitrile formation, whereas watershed-dominated NOM is especially rich in trihaloacetic acid and trihalomethane precursors as well as ultraviolet-absorbing substances.

Development of an NDVI-Based Nitrogen Rate Calculator for Cotton	CROP SCIENCE												The use and adoption of optical sensors to determine midseason nitrogen (N) application rates in cereal grain production has gained increasing acceptance by producers in the past decade; however, the technology has yet to impact mainstream cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production. Overapplication of N in cotton leads to excessive growth and can result in a dramatic yield decrease. This study was designed to develop a sensor-based cotton yield prediction model using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) readings from an optical sensor, incorporate the model into an algorithm used to determine midseason N rates, and determine if N response can be predicted using NDVI values collected midseason. A GreenSeeker hand held sensor was used to measure NDVI from seven studies at Lake Carl Blackwell (LCB), Stillwater, OK, and Southwest Research Station (SWR), Altus, OK, from 2006 to 2010. Normalized difference vegetation index readings taken at white flower stage had a good correlation with final yield. Final yield prediction was improved when NDVI was normalized using cumulative growing degree day (CumGDD) measured between planting and sensing. Sorting NDVI by CumGDD to 940 to 1200 and 1400 to 1500 at LCB and SWR sites, respectively, extended the critical sensing window from match-head square to white flower stages. This study showed that yield potential in cotton could be predicted within the season using NDVI, which confirms the potential for using sensor-based N rate recommendations in cotton.

Water, quality assessment of Kavvayi Lake of northern Kerala, India using CCME water quality index and biological water quality criteria	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Assessment of water quality status of 7 sites of Kavvayi Wetland in northern Kerala (India) was carried out. The physico-chemical, bacteriological and biological parameters were monitored during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) water quality index of the Kavvayi Lake samples ranged from 43.99-44.77; indicating that water quality was threatened or impaired. The poor water quality status might be due to dumping of wastes from municipal and domestic sources and agricultural runoff. Biological water quality criteria (BWQC) determined for wetland revealed that stations such as mixing point of Kariangode River into Kavvayi Lake and Kottikkadavu was moderately polluted in pre monsoon and post- monsoon seasons. Mixing point of Nileswar River into Kavvayi Lake was moderately polluted in pre-monsoon season. Both calculated indices suggest that quality of lake was found to be influenced by anthropogenic activities such as unscientific tourism and infrastructure development, land encroachment, sand mining, pollution etc. The study was carried out as part of a programme, which aimed to conserve Kavvayi wetland because of its unique ecological and environmental characteristics.

J	Viana, DS; Cid, B; Figuerola, J; Santamaría, L				Viana, Duarte S.; Cid, Bertha; Figuerola, Jordi; Santamaria, Luis			Disentangling the roles of diversity resistance and priority effects in community assembly	OECOLOGIA												The assembly of many biological communities is constrained by the resistance exerted by resident species to immigration (biotic resistance). Two important mechanisms contribute to the generation of biotic resistance: diversity resistance and priority effects. These mechanisms have been explored through theoretical models and laboratory experiments, but the importance of their interplay in the assembly of natural communities remains untested. We used a mesocosm experiment with communities of aquatic plants and zooplankton assembled from natural propagule banks to test whether and how diversity resistance, mediated by the diversity of the resident community, and priority effects, mediated by the timing of immigrants' arrival, affect the establishment of immigrant species and community diversity. In plant communities, immigration success decreased with increasing resident-species richness (diversity resistance) and arrival time (priority effects). Further, diversity resistance was stronger in communities colonized later in the season, indicating that these mechanisms interacted to reinforce biotic resistance. This interaction ultimately determined species richness and beta-diversity in plant communities. For zooplankton, in contrast, neither the diversity of resident communities nor the time of arrival affected the establishment of immigrant species. In these communities, beta-diversity was explained by species sorting, namely biotic effects mediated by plant assemblages. Our results show that the progressive buildup of communities generates an interaction between diversity resistance and priority effects that eventually determines community diversity, unless species sorting mediated by environmental filtering supersedes the effect of biotic resistance. Therefore, disentangling the mechanisms underlying biotic resistance contributes to understand how species diversity is ultimately determined.

J	Gigante, D; Venanzoni, R; Zuccarello, V				Gigante, Daniela; Venanzoni, Roberto; Zuccarello, Vincenzo			Reed die-back in southern Europe? A case study from Central Italy	COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES												Common reed die-back is a widely investigated phenomenon in Central Europe, not frequently recorded in S-European areas and almost unknown in the Mediterranean Basin. Symptoms of reed decline recently observed in the Italian Peninsula provided the starting point for a detailed investigation on a reed population in one of the largest freshwater ecosystems in Central Italy. The analyses were conducted over two vegetative seasons in 19 plots at seven locations. A set of 13 morphologic and phenologic reed traits were screened, monitored and statistically analysed. The data indicated the presence of the reed die-back syndrome in a wet Mediterranean ecosystem and enabled us to highlight a set of usable traits to detect the condition of decline. Among them, the stem height and diameter, the number of nodes, the relative growth rate and the lateral root diameter resulted the most significant factors highlighting the declining condition. Some environmental characteristics of the reed stands were also taken into account. The period of submersion and the presence of standing litter emerged as important features of the stands, strictly related to the degree of decline in the population. The results draw attention to the risk, in southern Europe too, of the loss of an ecosystem which plays an important role in biodiversity conservation. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences.

Virus morphological diversity and relationship to bacteria and chlorophyll across a freshwater trophic gradient in the Lake Michigan watershed	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The critical roles of viruses in nutrient cycling are well established for marine ecosystems, but less is known for freshwater viruses about diversity, seasonality, and relationships with productivity and ecosystem trophic status. This study aimed to examine virus morphotypes and abundance in relation to prokaryotic cell abundance and chlorophyll a concentrations in three seasonal temperate freshwater sites representing eutrophic, mesotrophic, and oligotrophic status in Lake Michigan watershed. We found strong correlations between virus-like particle abundance (VLPA) and prokaryote abundance (PA) and chlorophyll concentration across the trophic gradient (r = 0.744, P < 0.001, n = 123), but without consistent seasonal patterns. TEM showed Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and non-tailed virus morphotypes. The eutrophic site was distinct with one- to two-fold higher PA and VLPA than mesotrophic and oligotrophic sites. But the eutrophic and mesotrophic sites had more similar VLPA:PA ratios (eutrophic 26, mesotrophic 25.5, oligotrophic 4.1). The oligotrophic site also had a lower proportion of Podoviridae and more Siphoviridae than the other sites. The similarity between eutrophic and mesotrophic sites, but a distinctive oligotrophic site, suggests that the effects of terrestrial runoff as sources of viruses and hosts may be important, along with P limitation and trophic status, in determining virus-host relationships in freshwaters.

Robert			Life history traits of an equatorial common carp Cyprinus carpio population in relation to thermal influences on invasive populations	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Marginal increment ratio analysis of scales collected from the exploited common carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) population of Lake Naivasha between June 2008 and November 2009 revealed they were valid for ageing purposes, with an annual growth check formed. Individuals were fast growing and only present to the age of 4 years. Growth was sexually dimorphic (females being faster growing) and the temporal pattern in the gonadosomatic index suggested reproduction was asynchronous and occurred throughout the sampling period. A meta-analysis of traits of carp from across their range revealed that temperature was a major determinant of their growth parameters (L-infinity and the K of the von Bertalanffy growth model). Populations in more seasonal climates (as described by increased differences between the minimum and maximum monthly mean temperature in a year) were slower growing but had increased potential for attaining larger sizes. This helped explain the expression of their traits in Lake Naivasha where the mean monthly temperatures of between 20 and 23 degrees C were aseasonal. The life history traits of carp in Lake Naivasha provided their population with resilience to fishery exploitation with increased catches being independent of fishing effort. The influence of temperature on this globally invasive fish is in line with the findings for other invasive fishes and provides insights into their invasion patterns and processes.

Visualizing social-ecological intensities for management of recreation visitors in a multiuse system	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Accounting for the variation of visitor conflicts and ecological disturbance of outdoor recreation activities across space and time can cause difficulty for managers seeking to make decisions in social-ecological systems (SESs). We develop a method to quantify and visualize social and ecological intensities resulting from outdoor recreation. We demonstrate the utility of our method at Valentine National Wildlife Refuge, where we conducted onsite surveys for an entire year of recreationists participating in consumptive (i.e., hunting), intermediate consumptive (i.e., fishing) and nonconsumptive (e.g., hiking) activities. We use survey results and combine them with expert consensus by engaging refuge managers and scientists (i.e., Delphi method) to chart patterns in social (e.g., visitor conflicts) and ecological (e.g., damages to natural resources) intensities across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We highlight unexpected patterns that are revealed by collectively considering multi activity groups through space and time and combining different survey methods (onsite, Delphi method). Based on the consensus reached using the Delphi method, the consumptive group had the greatest potential for social conflicts and ecological disturbances. Social and ecological intensities (i.e., hotspots) of recreation varied across lake types and seasons, highlighting high-intensity areas and periods on the refuge. Accounting for diverse outdoor recreation activities and coinciding social and ecological intensities will allow managers of SESs the ability to concomitantly preserve ecological resources, prioritize conservation efforts, and minimize visitor conflicts. We demonstrate the utility and ease of use of this technique, which can be implemented by managers and scientists within their respective SES of interest.					; Kaemingk, Mark/Q-2191-2019; Chizinski, Christopher/G-6306-2011; Pope, Kevin/D-8096-2011; Powell, Larkin/G-4570-2010	Kaemingk, Mark/0000-0001-9588-4563; Chizinski, Christopher/0000-0001-9294-2588; Powell, Larkin/0000-0003-0570-4210													0301-4797	1095-8630				FEB 15	2022	304								114224	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114224		DEC 2021						34883436					WOS:000733008300006

A special rigged beach seine (with 6 mm codend mesh size) was used in the sampling process. Fishing trials were carried out 4 different stations of lake between March-2014 and February-2015 with monthly period so as to generating of the length frequency (LFQ) data. TropFishR package was used for analyzing of the LFQ data with bootstrapped ELEFAN I process in the VPA. A total of 2938 fish were measured in the study. A 21-year-old official catch data was used in CMSY analysis. Growth parameters L-infinity, K, and t(o) were estimated as 14.21 cm, 0.52 yr(-), -0.3 for female; 13.82 cm, 0.55 yr(-), -0.37 for male and 14.26 cm, 0.52 yr(-), -0.39 for both sexes respectively. Total mortality coefficient (Z), natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) were estimated as 3.57 yr(-), 1.04 yr(-) and 2.53 yr(-) respectively. VPA based biological reference points F-max, F-05, F-01, and SPR were estimated as 1.09, 0.48, 0.67 and 0.11 respectively. CMSY based reference points F-MSY, MSY, B-MSY, F were computed as 0.382, 1.987, 5.079 and 0.511 respectively. Overexploitation was determined on the A. boyeri stock using of the both VPA (F/F-max > 1) and CMSY (F/F-MSY > 1).

J	Lindström, S; Erlström, M				Lindstrom, Sofie; Erlstrom, Mikael			The Jurassic-Cretaceous transition of the Fararp-1 core, southern Sweden: Sedimentological and phytological indications of climate change	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The 116m deep Fararp-1 core drilled in the Vomb Trough in southernmost Sweden is dated by integrated terrestrial and marine palynostratigraphy. The lower part of the succession (ca 84 m) encompasses uppermost Jurassic to lowermost Cretaceous (uppermost Tithonian to Valanginian) strata. An unconformity separates the Valanginian strata from an overlying ca 1 m thick interval of upper Albian to Cenomanian Arnager Greensand Formation. The uppermost part of the core is a repetitive succession of lowermost Cretaceous sediments. During the Jurassic-Cretaceous U/K) transition NW Europe was located in mid latitudes, and comprised an archipelago of large and small islands separated by deeper grabens and epicontinental seaways that connected the Boreal Sea to the north with the warmer Tethys Ocean to the south. Boundary strata in England, France, the Netherlands and Germany are characterised by relatively prominent climatic change from arid/semi arid to subhumid/humid conditions. Southernmost Sweden was located on the margin of a large landmass comprising most of the Fennoscandian Shield bordering a large epicontinental sea to the west. By combining sedimentology, clay mineralogy and palynofacies the Tithonian to Valanginian cored succession of the Fararp-1 core provides complementary information on how marginal deposits from the eastern part of the epicontinental sea reflect the climatological and environmental changes observed in other parts of NW Europe. The Fararp-1 core shows that during the Tithonian to earliest Berriasian deposition took place in a terrestrial but near-marine depositional setting, in coastal lakes or lagoons with little marine influence. A dry climatic regime favoured stagnant water conditions with common algal blooms of primarily Bonyococcus and zygnemataceae. Palynofacies and sedimentology indicate limited transport of freshwater and material to the basin. The stagnant depositional environment was terminated by a marine flooding in the early Berriasian. During the remaining Berriasian and the early Valanginian conditions shifted between near marine and marine settings in a dynamic coastal environment, similar to contemporaneous assemblages reported from the Danish Island of Bornholm. A shift in clay mineralogy, from a dominance of 10 A minerals to increasing amounts of mixed layer and kaolinite indicates a change to more humid conditions in the latest Tithonian. Cheirolepidacean pollen (Classopollis) are present but never common in the cored succession, and a similar conspicuous decrease of these pollen, as previously reported from England, Germany and France, is not evident in the Fararp-1 core. Instead a subsequent shift in both palynofacies and palynoflora, marked by an increase in abundance of heavy terrigenous material, i.e. wood and coal particles, upland pollen grains and reworked palynomorphs is also observed in the uppermost Tithonian-lowermost Berriasian interval. At the same level spores and pollen classified as warmer/drier elements decrease in abundance. This is interpreted as representing a shift to more humid climatic conditions with increased runoff from the hinterland. Thus, the combined sedimentological and palynological data from the Fararp-1 core suggest that climatic conditions in the area changed from more seasonally dry (semi-arid) to more humid (semi-humid) across the J/K boundary (latest Tithonian to earliest Berriasian) and hence earlier than the mid-Berriasian climatic shift recorded from e.g. England and the Netherlands.

J	Duffy, MA				Duffy, Meghan A.			Ecological consequences of intraspecific variation in lake Daphnia	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Although populations harbour considerable diversity, most ecological studies still assume they are homogeneous. However, mounting evidence suggests that intraspecific diversity is not only common, but also important for interactions with community members. Here, intraspecific variation in Daphnia dentifera in haemoglobin content is shown to be a marker of hypolimnion use. 2. Hypolimnion use differed substantially within and among D. dentifera populations. Daphnia dentifera with haemoglobin resided primarily in the hypolimnion, while D. dentifera lacking haemoglobin migrated vertically. These 'deep' and 'migratory' D. dentifera had different seasonal phenologies and dynamics. 3. Deep and migratory D. dentifera had qualitatively different relationships with an important competitor, Daphnia pulicaria. Deep D. dentifera density was negatively correlated with D. pulicaria density, whereas migratory density was not correlated with D. pulicaria density. 4. Given that D. pulicaria tends to reside in the hypolimnion, this negative correlation probably reflects competition between D. pulicaria and the deep D. dentifera. This pattern would have been missed if only the relationship between the overall lake populations of D. dentifera and D. pulicaria had been studied. 5. Abundances of deep D. dentifera and D. pulicaria were both correlated with the size of the hypolimnetic refuge from fish predation, but in opposite directions. Lakes with large refuges generally had high D. pulicaria and low deep D. dentifera densities.					; Duffy, Meghan/E-6867-2016	Duffy, Meghan/0000-0002-8142-0802; 													0046-5070					MAY	2010	55	5					995	1004		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02336.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02336.x													WOS:000276655200006

Factors controlling accumulation of organic carbon in a rift-lake, Oligocene Vietnam	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Understanding of the processes of petroleum source rock (SR) accumulation in lacustrine rift basins and the behavior of lake systems as long-term carbon sinks is fragmentary. Investigation of an 800 m thick (500 m core and similar to 300 m outcrop), deep-lacustrine, Oligocene section in Vietnam, provides a rare insight into the controls and deposition of organic carbon (OC) and SR formation in continental rift basins. A multidisciplinary dataset, combining elemental data, inorganic and organic geochemistry with sedimentology, shows that the richest alginite-prone, sapropelic SR developed during periods of relative tectonic quiescence characterized by moderate primary productivity in a mainly dysoxic lacustrine basin. Increased rift activity and further development of graben morphology intensified water column stratification and anoxia, which hindered nutrient recycling. Sapropelic organic matter (OM) continued to accumulate, but with increasing amorphous OM content and decreasing total OC values. Periods of increased seasonality were characterized by thermocline weakening, enhanced mixing of water columns, increased primary productivity and diatom blooming. The results suggest that a change from dysoxia towards anoxia or extreme primary productivity does not necessarily enhance OC burial and SR quality. External nutrient input from a phosphate-rich hinterland is sufficient for sapropel formation, whereas the main limiting factor is methanogenesis.

To define the sources and controlling processes for river water chemistry within the Lake Qinghai catchment, high precision ICP-MS trace element concentrations were measured in water samples collected from the Buha River weekly in 2007, and from other major rivers in the post-monsoon (late October 2006) and monsoon (late July 2007) seasons. The distributions of trace elements vary in time and space with distinct seasonal patterns. The primary flux in the Buha River is higher TDS and dissolved Al, B, Cr, Li, Mo, Rb, Sr and U during springtime than those during other seasons and is attributed to the inputs derived from both rock weathering and atmospheric processes. Among these elements, the fluxes of dissolved Cr, B and Rb are strongly influenced by eolian dust input. The fluxes of dissolved Li, Mo, Sr and U are also influenced by weathering processes, reflecting the sensitivity of chemical weathering to monsoon conditions. The anthropogenic sources appear to be the dominant contribution to potentially harmful metals (Ni, Cu, Co. Zn and Pb), with high fluxes at onset of the main discharge pulses due, at least partially, to a runoff washout effect. For other major rivers, except for Ba, concentrations of trace elements are higher in the monsoon than in the post-monsoon season. A total of 38.5 +/- 3.1 tons of potentially harmful elements are transported into the lake annually, despite human activities within the catchment being limited. Nearly all river water samples contain dissolved trace elements below the World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water, with the exception of As and B in the Daotang River water samples collected in late July probably mobilized from underlying lacustrine sediments.

While a strong advance in ice monitoring worldwide has been provided by the recent development of remote sensing methods, quantification of seasonal ice cover is impossible without on-site autonomous measurements of the mass and heat budget. In the present study, we propose an autonomous monitoring system for continuous in situ measuring of vertical temperature distribution in the near-ice air, the ice strata and the under-ice water layer for several months with simultaneous records of solar radiation incoming at the lake surface and passing through the snow and ice covers as well as snow and ice thicknesses. The use of modern miniature analog and digital sensors made it possible to make a compact, energy efficient measurement system with high precision and spatial resolution and characterized by easy deployment and transportation. In particular, the high resolution of the ice thickness probe of 0.05 mm allows to resolve the fine-scale processes occurring in low-flow environments, such as freshwater lakes. Several systems were tested in numerous studies in Lake Baikal and demonstrated a high reliability in deriving the ice heat balance components during ice-covered periods.

An artificial lake system established in the core zone of the Al Marmoom Desert Conservation Reserve, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, primarily intended for recreational purposes, assists wildlife to cope with water shortages and the extreme hot climate of the Arabian Desert. This area potentially opens up conflicts between recreational use and wildlife welfare. The Red-wattled Lapwing (Vanellus indicus aigneri) is a spreading Asian shorebird tightly linked to water resources and tolerant of human disturbance. We analyzed the habitat use and reproductive success of this species, following 361 nests and 373 chicks in 2018 and 2019 to reveal the breeding potential of the Reserve. The occurrence of lapwings dropped sharply at a distance of 500 m from the lakes, regardless of vegetation cover and desert type. In addition, nest site choice strongly reflected the proximity of water within the core lakes area. The Lapwings bred preferentially on islands built in the centers of the lakes, where they started breeding earlier in the season. They had a lower nest predation rate on islands than on the surrounding mainland, but the chicks grew slightly more slowly on islands, probably due to lower food availability. However, survival of island and mainland chicks was similar. We conclude that the shallow shores of lakes with islands make the area suitable for breeding of the Lapwing in the Arabian desert, despite extensive recreational use and constant human disturbance. This study shows an example of combining appropriate landscape design with benefits for humans and current support for wildlife conservation.					; Šálek, Miroslav/K-1934-2016; Chajma, Petr/JLM-6721-2023; Pešková, Lucie/KDN-6903-2024	Elhassan, Esmat/0000-0001-6018-0099; Sladecek, Martin/0000-0003-4043-4471; Chajma, Petr/0000-0002-5278-1561; Brynychova, Katerina/0000-0001-7307-7998; 													1712-6568					DEC	2021	16	2							20	10.5751/ACE-01978-160220	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-01978-160220													WOS:000739877700024

Coupling Mineralogy and Oxygen Isotopes to Seasonal Environmental Shifts Recorded in Modern Freshwater Pearl Nacre From Kentucky Lake	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Biominerals that accrete shell or skeleton are commonly used as windows to past geochemical environments. Using biominerals as paleoproxies depends on the assumption that biominerals faithfully and predictably record environmental parameters, yet little has been done from a mineralogical perspective to understand how various environmental shifts impact shell and skeleton mineralogy and how mineralogy influences proxy calibrations. In this study, we correlate a suite of environmental data from the Kentucky Lake Long-Term Monitoring Program with mineralogical and chemical signatures of modern cultured pearl nacre. Six transects were measured across three pearls from nucleus to edge for oxygen isotope ratio (delta O-18) using SIMS (10-mu m spots) and for mineralogy via nacre tablet thickness using SEM and via carbonate bonding environments using Raman spectroscopy. After confirming a strong seasonal correlation between delta O-18 and temperature, we extend delta O-18 correlations to relative nacre OH/O ratios, lake dissolved oxygen, and lake light levels at 1 m depth. Although nacre tablet thicknesses are not clearly correlated with temperature, we observe correlative trends with lake conductivity and relative nacre OH/O ratios. For the Raman spectroscopy measurements, there was a modest inverse correlation between increasing carbonate nu(1) and nu(4) vibrational mode peak heights with delta O-18 and lake dissolved oxygen levels. Standard deviations in Raman T:L peak area ratios, as an estimation of angle spread of tablet crystallographic orientation, correlate with lake reduction potential. This approach of combining geochemical, isotopic, mineralogical, and environmental data lends a more holistic view to biomineralization in natural systems and to the decoding of environmental mineral signatures.					; Valley, John/B-3466-2011	Orland, Ian/0000-0002-4853-4111; Valley, John/0000-0003-3530-2722; Farfan, Gabriela/0000-0001-5204-7044														1525-2027				DEC	2021	22	12							e2021GC009995	10.1029/2021GC009995	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021GC009995													WOS:000735891600017

GPS-tracking of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis reveals sex-specific differences in foraging behaviour	ARDEA												Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis are considered generalist predators feeding in a variety of marine and freshwater habitats on many different prey species. Recently however, there is increasing evidence that even seemingly generalist species can often be regarded as a diverse group of individual specialists sometimes induced by sex-specific foraging behaviour. To test whether this also holds true for Great Cormorants, the present study characterised the at-sea distribution and examined the time budgets of provisioning Great Cormorants by deploying GPS-loggers on 11 nesting males and females during the breeding season of 2012. Additionally, pellets were collected from underneath the nests of these tagged birds for detailed diet analysis, based on the otoliths and fish bones recorded within them. Diverse foraging patterns were recorded, ranging from exclusively freshwater feeding, to offshore foraging, with the furthest recorded distance from the colony being 28 km at sea. Time budgets during foraging trips revealed relatively long periods of resting ashore (55% of the trip +/- 23%), followed by foraging (31 +/- 18%), and time spent in flight (15 +/- 11%). Flatfishes dominated in the diets of these Great Cormorants, indicating benthic-foraging strategies when foraging in saltwater (feeding on discards could be ruled out). The males in this study avoided freshwater foraging habitat and preferred offshore waters with a sandy bottom or nearshore waters along-side rocky breakwaters and within harbours. Females foraged in all habitat types, but proportionally more in inland freshwater bodies. Females spent more time on foraging than did males, particularly in marine habitats, whilst males rested more. It is proposed that these differences might have been caused by sex-specific foraging strategies, possibly resulting from competition at foraging sites.

We investigated the relative importance of the structural complexity of macrophytes and environmental variables on the abundance and richness of the macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with aquatic plants across the Esteros del Ibera. This protected wetland system located in Corrientes (Argentina) is fed by rain. Macrophyte habitat complexity was quantified by measuring fractal geometry dimensions of area and perimeter and plant biomass. We sampled macroinvertebrates associated with five species of macrophyte (Egeria najas, Cabomba caroliniana, Potamogeton gayi, Eichhornia azurea and Salvinia biloba) in five shallow lakes during two different seasons (dry and rainy) between 2007 and 2008. Regression analyses revealed that macrophyte structural complexity was an important factor on macroinvertebrate assemblages, whereas explanatory power of environmental variables was low. In both seasons, the fractal dimension of area was the variable with the highest explanatory power on richness, and plant biomass was in the case of macroinvertebrate abundance. To conserve macroinvertebrate diversity in Esteros del Ibera, it would be necessary to maintain the natural heterogeneity indicated by the different structural complexities of the macrophytes across the wetland.					; Ubeda, Barbara/AAT-6839-2020	Ubeda Sanchez, Barbara/0000-0001-8165-2091; Sabater, Lara Milena/0000-0001-7102-9087; Casco, Sylvina/0000-0001-8326-8931; Gallardo, Luciana/0000-0001-6410-9273													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2021	41	8							105	10.1007/s13157-021-01508-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01508-4													WOS:000713113900001
J	van der Molen, JS; Perissinotto, R				van der Molen, Johan S.; Perissinotto, Renzo			Microalgal productivity in an estuarine lake during a drought cycle: The St. Lucia Estuary, South Africa	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The St. Lucia estuarine lake on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is one of the largest estuarine systems in Africa and of unique importance for the adjacent marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The area regularly experiences periods of drought, resulting in hypersaline conditions in its shallow lakes and the closure of the estuarine mouth. This study aimed to assess the primary production rates of phytoplankton and microphytobenthos throughout an annual cycle of this drought phase. Primary production rates were assessed at representative sites, namely the Mouth, Narrows, South and North Lakes from June 2006 to May 2007. Because of the drought, the salinity gradient from the mouth to the head of the estuary was reversed by comparison to estuarine systems with a steady freshwater inflow and regular marine exchange. In March 2007, during the study, the mouth opened as a result of rough seas, and the marine influence broke the existing reversed gradient, producing a marine salinity throughout the system. Microphytobenthic primary productivity varied between 0 and 34 mg C m(-2) h(-1) and showed strong correlations with salinity. DIN:DIP ratios and irradiance. Benthic productivity was high across the system after breaching of the mouth. Pelagic primary productivity (between 0 and 180 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), showed a correlation with temperature and irradiance and was highest across the system in February 2007 when the mouth was still closed. There was no significant correlation between production rates and biomass (chl-a) in either the benthic or pelagic habitats. The negative correlation between DIN:DIP ratio and benthic primary productivity indicated that phosphorus was the limiting nutrient. This study shows that salinity, along with seasonally dependent parameters such as temperature and irradiance, correlates with the rate of microalgal production. Hence, in these shallow lakes, the largest primary productivity can occur in either the pelagic or benthic subsystems, depending on prevailing conditions at the time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Douglas			ECOLOGICAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO VARIABILITY OF PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANT BIOACCUMULATION WITHIN FORAGE FISH COMMUNITIES OF THE DETROIT RIVER, ONTARIO, CANADA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Understanding variability of contaminant bioaccumulation within and among fish populations is critical for distinguishing between the chemical and biological mechanisms that contribute to food web biomagnification and quantifying contaminant exposure risks in aquatic ecosystems. The present study examined the relative contributions of chemical hydrophobicity (octanol-water partition coefficient [K-OW]) and habitat use as factors regulating variability in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener bioaccumulation in 3 lower trophic level cyprinid species across spatial and temporal scales. Bluntnose minnows (Pimephales notatus), spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius), and emerald shiners (Notropis atherinoides) were sampled at 3 locations in the Detroit River, Ontario, Canada. Variability in PCB concentration was evaluated with respect to several factors, including chemical hydrophobicity, site, season, species, and weight using sum of squares and Levene's test of homogeneity of variance. Individual variability in bioaccumulated congener-specific residues depended on chemical hydrophobicity with mid-and high-range K-OW congeners (logK(OW)>6.0), demonstrating the highest amount of variance compared with low K-OW congeners. Different feeding strategies also contributed to the variance observed for mid-range K-OW congeners among species. In the present study, benthic feeding specialists exhibited lower variance in PCB concentrations compared with the 2 generalist species. The results indicate that chemical hydrophobicity and feeding ecology not only contribute to differences in the biomagnification potentials of fish, but also regulate between-individual variation in PCB concentrations both across and within fish species.

For this purpose, we investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the RFAI with the objectives of testing the effects of the unit measure (catch in numbers or individual weight) of abundance and trophic metrics categories on the index response and, to identify the best sampling season for a bio-assessment program. We located seventy-two sampling sites in three different reservoir zones( fluvial, transition, and lacustrine) and collected samples by habitats -lateral (L), tributary mouth (M) and central (C) - inside each reservoir zone. We recorded the fish assemblages and several physicochemical and habitat variables in the dry and rainy seasons. We tested candidate metrics for range, responsiveness, and redundancy and selected nine for inclusion in the final indices (RFAI(N), the index calculated when we expressed fish in number of individuals, per species, and RFAI(W), calculated when we expressed fishes in weight, per species). We used a discrete scoring criterion (1,3,5), and the final indices varied from 9 to 45. RFAI(N) and RFAI(W) were highly correlated and able to detect a clear spatial variability among the five reservoirs. RFAI(N) showed a higher temporal variability especially in the smaller reservoirs of the system (Bariri, Ibitinga and Nova Avanhandava), allowing us to consider the dry season as the preferable sampling period for the development of bio-assessment programs. RFAI(W) appeared to be more responsive than RFAIN, and was in agreement with the environmental gradients observed when analyzing the physico chemical and habitat variables collected in the present study. These findings indicate that the fish multimetric approach is a suitable tool for the assessment of the biological conditions of these reservoirs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The lake is monomictic, with a seasonal thermocline located at a depth of approximately 20 m. Field data show the presence of basin-scale internal waves that are forced by daily winds and affected by Coriolis acceleration. A modal linear and nonlinear analysis of internal waves has been used, assuming a two-layer system. The numerical simulations show good agreement with the internal wave field observations. The obtained modes were used to study the energy dissipation within the system, which is necessary to control the amplitude growth. Field data and numerical simulations identify (1) the occurrence of a horizontal mode 1 Kelvin wave, with a period of about a day that coincides with the frequency of daily winds, suggesting that this mode of the Kelvin waves is in a resonant state (subject to damping and controlled by frictional effects in the field) and (2) the presence of higher-frequency internal waves, which are excited by non-linear interactions between basin-scale internal waves. The non-linear simulation indicates that only 10% of the dissipation rate of the Kelvin wave is because of bottom friction, while the rest 90% represents the energy that is radiated from the Kelvin wave to other modes. Also, this study shows that modes with periods between 5 and 8 h are excited by non-linear interactions between the fundamental Kelvin wave and horizontal Poincare-type waves. A laboratory study of the resonant interaction between a periodic forcing and the internal wave field response has also been performed, confirming the resonance for the horizontal mode 1 Kelvin wave.					; Nino, Yarko/H-1436-2016; Ulloa, Hugo N./HOA-7472-2023; Davies, Peter/KLZ-9236-2024; Niño, Yarko/H-1436-2016; de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/G-7018-2016	Ulloa, Hugo N./0000-0002-1995-6630; Nino, Yarko/0000-0002-0108-2656; de la Fuente Stranger, Alberto/0000-0001-5415-9816													1567-7419	1573-1510				AUG	2014	14	4					849	871		10.1007/s10652-013-9329-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-013-9329-9													WOS:000340845000006

Post-hatch dispersal of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens, Rafinesque, 1817) yolk-sac larvae in relation to substrate in an artificial stream	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Knowledge of the effects of environment and genotype on behavior during early ontogenetic stages of many fish species including lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) is generally lacking. Understanding these effects is particularly important at a time when human activities are fundamentally altering habitats and seasonal and diel physical and biotic stream features. Artificial stream channels were used in a controlled experiment to quantify lake sturgeon yolk-sac larvae dispersal distance and stream substrate preference from different females (N=2) whose eggs were incubated at different temperatures (10 and 18 degrees C) that simulated stream conditions during early and late spawning and incubation periods in the Black River, Michigan. Data revealed that yolk-sac larvae exhibited considerable variability in dispersal distance as a function of family (genotype), temperature experienced during previous (embryonic) ontogenetic stages, and environmental grain'. Yolk-sac larvae dispersal distance varied as a function of the juxtaposition of substrate to location of egg hatch. Lake sturgeon yolk-sac larvae dispersed from mesh screens attached to bricks and settled exclusively in gravel substrate. Dispersal distance also varied as a function of family and egg incubation temperatures, reflecting differences in offspring body size and levels of endogenous yolk reserves (yolk sac area) at hatch. Expression of plasticity in dispersal behavior may be particularly important to individual survival and population levels of recruitment contingent upon the location, size, and degree of fragmentation of suitable (gravel) habitats between adult spawning and yolk-sac larvae rearing areas.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				DEC	2013	29	6					1208	1213		10.1111/jai.12273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12273													WOS:000327212000003

However, sources of semi-labile DOC in lakes remain unclear. This study used a carbon stable isotope approach to examine relative contributions of autochthonous and allochthonous sources to semi-labile DOC. Vertical and seasonal variations in the concentration and carbon stable isotope ratio (delta C-13) of DOC were determined in large (surface area 674 km(2); maximum depth 104 m), monomictic Lake Biwa. A sharp vertical gradient of delta C-13 of DOC (delta C-13-DOC) during the stratification period [mean +/- A standard error (SE) -25.5 +/- A 0.1 and -26.0 +/- A 0.0aEuro degrees in the epi- and hypolimnion, respectively] indicated the accumulation of C-13-rich DOC in the epilimnion. Vertical mixing explained the intermediate values of delta C-13-DOC (-25.7 +/- A 0.0aEuro degrees) measured throughout the water column during the overturn period. Both DOC concentration and delta C-13-DOC decreased in the hypolimnion during stratification, indicating selective remineralization of C-13-rich DOC. Using a two-component mixing model, we estimated the delta C-13 value of semi-labile DOC to be -22.2 +/- A 0.3aEuro degrees, which was close to the delta C-13 of particulate organic carbon collected in the epilimnion during productive seasons (-22.7 +/- A 0.7aEuro degrees) but much higher than the delta C-13-DOC in river waters (-26.5 +/- A 0.1aEuro degrees). Semi-labile DOC appeared to be mainly autochthonous in origin, produced by planktonic communities during productive seasons. The spatiotemporal uncoupling between production and remineralization of semi-labile DOC implies that hypolimnetic oxygen consumption may be affected by pelagic primary production during productive seasons of the preceding year.					; Tayasu, Ichiro/A-9924-2009	Yoshimizu, Chikage/0000-0002-4535-8976; Tayasu, Ichiro/0000-0002-3006-7973													1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2010	11	2					143	153		10.1007/s10201-009-0299-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0299-z													WOS:000278932000006

Neil			Interpreting lake isotope records of Holocene environmental change in the Eastern Mediterranean	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Meeting on the Last 15ka of Environmental Change in Mediterranean Regions	NOV 17-19, 2005	Baeza, SPAIN					Oxygen isotope records from lake sediment archives are becoming an increasingly common tool for palacoenvironmental reconstruction. We discuss their interpretation in the Eastern Mediterranean region with particular reference to three records, Zeribar, Van and Eski Acigol during the Holocene. The latter two records have been interpreted as controlled by changes in the precipitation to evaporation ratio, and the first due to changes in precipitation seasonality. In light of recent isotope work in the region and comparison with other proxy data from the same lakes, we show both of these initial interpretations to be oversimplified. Careful interpretations of complex lake isotope systems are therefore required in order that palaeoclimatic inferences are drawn correctly. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Such a bloom was observed in the north of the lake in September 2018. Phytoplankton species composition during this bloom is compared to a documented bloom in 1955, and to the composition in September 2011-2013. Meteorological observations suggest hydrodynamics could explain the occurrence of the 2018 bloom. Material and methods - Phytoplankton net samples were taken in the pelagic and littoral zone near Uvira during five consecutive days of the bloom in 2018. For the period 2011-2013, quantitative phytoplankton samples were obtained during a weekly sampling at the same sites. Samples were analysed with an inverted microscope and relative abundances of the algal species were compared. Key results - Dolichospermum flosaquae (Cyanobacteria) initially dominated the bloom followed by high relative abundance of Limnococcus limneticus (Cyanobacteria) on the third sampling day in September 2018. In the pelagic zone an increase of Nitzschia asterionelloides (Bacillariophyta), and Dictyosphaerium and Lobocystis (Chlorophyta) was observed while in the littoral zone increasing abundances of dinophytes were noted. Dolichospermum flosaquae was also responsible for the bloom reported in 1955, but was only sporadically observed in the 2011-2013 samples. Although Limnococcus limneticus was present in 2011-2013, it never reached relative abundances as high as during the 2018 bloom. Meteorological data indicate that 2018 experienced different conditions compared to previous years: strong south-east winds from May to September with a more eastern direction of the wind, and a well-marked drop in atmospheric pressure between August and September. Conclusion - After a very windy season, the combination of strong hydrodynamics, calmer lake conditions, and high solar radiation and air temperature in September 2018 was favourable for a massive Cyanobacteria bloom in the north of Lake Tanganyika.					; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020	Cocquyt, Christine/0000-0002-0047-4180; 													2032-3913	2032-3921				NOV 23	2021	154	3					351	361		10.5091/plecevo.2021.1890	http://dx.doi.org/10.5091/plecevo.2021.1890													WOS:000729080600004

Sediment quality indices (Cf, Cd, Er, and RI) were applied to achieve the research objectives based on the concentration of toxic metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn). The probably effective level is based on the concentration of As, Cr, and Ni observed. The coastal zone and the urban sector of the river have experienced a moderate ecological risk since 1975, especially during wet seasons (1988-1997) with a mean sedimentation rate of 2 cm/year. A significant correlation (r=0.439-0.633, p-values < 0.0001) between the toxic metal concentration and the Caspian Sea level fluctuation was obtained. The lowest concentration of toxic metals coincided with the high stand water level. Management practices recommend controlling toxic metals (As, Cd, Ni, Cr, Pb) from the sources and dredging of retention pounds along the Tajan River.

Modelled and satellite-derived surface albedo of lake ice - part II: evaluation of MODIS albedo products	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)	JUN 04-06, 2013	Huntsville, CANADA					Albedo products (MOD10A1, MYD10A1, and MCD43A3) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) have the potential to be integrated directly into lake ice models such as the Canadian lake ice model (CLIMo) to improve the simulation of freshwater break-up (ice-off). The high albedo of snow and lake ice has been shown to affect the timing of break-up. Therefore, the surface energy balance parameterization of CLIMo requires accurate estimates of albedo when modelling phenology. MOD10A1, MYD10A1, and MCD43A3 were evaluated against in situ snow and ice albedo observations taken over a partially snow-covered freshwater lake (Malcolm Ramsay Lake) near Churchill, Manitoba, during the ice growth period (15 February 2012 to 25 April 2012). The MODIS albedo products were then compared with the CLIMo's albedo parameterization during the ice break-up period. The MODIS albedo products MOD10A1, MYD10A1, and MCD43A3 retrieved snow and ice albedo with root mean square error values of 0.07, 0.08, and 0.06, respectively, compared with spatially averaged in situ albedo measurements during ice growth. MODIS albedo products compared with CLIMo's melting ice parameterization during the melt season indicate that CLIMo's albedo estimates have a mean difference of at least 0.14 compared with the MODIS retrievals during melt. The quality of the albedo retrievals over lake ice from MODIS and the need for more accurate albedo simulations during the melt season suggest that the assimilation of MODIS albedo products into CLIMo could be beneficial for the determination of break-up (ice-off) dates.

This study aimed at determining suitable phytoplankton bioindicators of water quality for biomonitoring of freshwater streams in the monomodal agroecological zone of Cameroon. Water physicochemical and hydrological parameters, together with phytoplankton abundance and diversity, were measured from June 2016 to May 2017 along the Benoe Stream. Principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were used to determine phytoplankton spatial and temporal distribution and identify indicator species. The Shannon-Wiener diversity and Pielou's evenness indices indicated a clean to mildly polluted stream with a diverse phytoplankton community consisting of 84 genera belonging to 51 families that was dominated by the Bacillariophyta (64%), followed by Chlorophyta (13%) and Cyanophyta (10%). The total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, stream water velocity, and discharge were the most important stream characteristics affecting the abundance of the dominant phytoplankton genera. Seasonal variations in the stream characteristics as well as spatial community distribution along an urban-small-scale farming - large-scale farming gradient were unveiled and their influence on the phytoplankton relative abundances. Increased abundance of Synedra ulna was indicative of low TDS and EC, which was the contrary for Gyrosigma baltium dominance. High Pleurosira laevis abundance was associated with the urban zone while high Diatoma sp. and Oscillatoria sp. abundances were related to the large-scale farming zone of the stream. These phytoplankton species have good potential for use as bioindicators for stream water quality monitoring in the monomodal agroecological zone.					; Riegert, Jan/D-9070-2016; Fai, Patricia/AAO-7532-2021; Kenko, Daniel/ABA-9800-2022	Nkontcheu Kenko, Daniel Brice/0000-0003-3981-3140; Korejs, Krystof/0000-0002-5028-4887; Riegert, Jan/0000-0003-4195-1278; Fai, Patricia/0000-0002-3666-3362; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2023	195	6							788	10.1007/s10661-023-11390-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11390-8								37261624					WOS:001000394800009

Results indicated lake water backflowing would affect the relative distribution of nitrogen species and increase the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate, especially in the outlets of municipal sewage and agricultural drainage. For backflowing areas, more frequent water exchange could lower the seasonal fluctuation of the abundance and diversity of microbial community. RDA results showed crucial water quality parameters that greatly influence bacterial community were total organic carbon (TOC), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity (SAL), ammonia, nitrate, TN for backflowing areas, and TOC, TDS, SAL, ammonia, TN without nitrate for unbackflowing areas. Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, Microcystis, and Arcobacter were dominant with 27.7%, 15.7%, 30.5%, and 25.7% contribution to the overall water quality in backflowing areas. Chloroflexi, Verrucomicrobia, Flavobacterium, and Nostocaceae were dominant with 25.0%, 18.4%, 22.3%, and 11.4% contribution to the overall water quality in unbackflowing areas. And lake water backflowing might mainly affect the amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism based on the metabolism function prediction. A better understanding of the spatiotemporal changes in water quality parameters and microbial community was obtained from this research to comprehensively assess the effect of lake water backflowing on the estuarine ecosystem.					zhang, yajie/GVT-3956-2022														0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2023	195	6							642	10.1007/s10661-023-11190-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11190-0								37145346					WOS:000982936200003
J	Ridgway, MS				Ridgway, Mark S.			A review of estimates of daily energy expenditure and food intake in cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Daily energy expenditure (DEE) and daily food intake (DFI) are key parameters in estimating population level consumption by cormorants. A number of different methods are still employed in estimating these parameters along with different estimates for assimilation efficiency (if used) and prey energy density. The pellet/fish size reconstruction and percent adult body weight methods underestimate DFI for a number of reasons including an implied underestimation of DEE. In the absence of study-specific data, an assimilation efficiency of 0.80 and prey energy density of 5.42 kJ.g(-1) are recommended. The bioenergetic model for field metabolic rate from Ellis and Gabrielsen (2002) is recommended for adults during the nesting season and their model for basal metabolic rate (BMR x 2.5) is recommended for adults or sub-adults outside the nesting season. Comparisons between empirical and bioenergetic models for chick DFI are also made with recommendations on estimating DFI. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Lorke, A				Lorke, Andreas			Boundary mixing in the thermocline of a large lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												High-resolution measurements of near-bottom temperature stratification and current velocity were performed on the sloping boundary of a large lake at the depth of the seasonal thermocline. The measurements cover nearly the entire stratified period and reveal the periodic occurrence of strong temperature and current velocity fluctuations, which can be attributed to shoaling high-frequency internal waves with periods between 5 and 20 min. Two different techniques are applied to obtain a long-term record of dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy from the current velocity measurements. Shoaling of high-frequency internal waves is associated with a strong and rapid increase of turbulent dissipation rates of up to four orders of magnitude. Since the occurrence of high-frequency internal waves on the slope is correlated with the passage of the dominant basin-scale internal Kelvin wave with a period of four days, energy dissipation rates on the slope vary with the same period. Diapycnal diffusivities, estimated by combining the dissipation estimates with simultaneously measured density stratification, follow a similar dynamics and a comparison with a basin-scale diffusivity estimate based on tracer measurements reveal the importance of boundary mixing, which, at this particular site, is mainly driven by the interaction of high-frequency internal waves with the sloping boundary.

Microcystins (MCs) were quantitatively determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with a qualitative analysis by a Finnigan LC-MS system. On the average of the study period, hepatopancreas was the highest in MC contents (mean 4.14 and range 1.06-7.42 mug g(-1) DW), followed by digestive tracts (mean 1.69 and range 0.8-4.54 mug g(-1) DW) and gonad (mean 0.715 and range 0-2.62 mug g(-1) DW), whereas foot was the least (mean 0.01 and range 0-0.06 mug g(-1) DW). There was a positive correlation in MC contents between digestive tracts and hepatopancreas. A constantly higher MC content in hepatopancreas than in digestive tracts indicates a substantial bioaccumulation of MCs in the hepatopancreas of the snail. The average ratio of MC-LR/MC-RR showed a steady increase from digestive tracts (0.44) to hepatopancreas (0.63) and to gonad (0.96), suggesting that MC-LR was more resistant to degradation in the snail. Since most MCs were present in the hepatopancreas, digestive tracts and gonad with only a very small amount in the edible foot, the risk to human health may not be significant if these toxic parts are removed prior to snail consumption. However, the possible transference of toxins along food chains should not be a negligible concern. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We estimated in situ NEP using three independent approaches (net CO2 gas flux, net O-2 gas flux, and continuous diel O-2 measurements) over a 4-7 yr period in a series of small lakes in which food webs were manipulated and nutrient loadings were experimentally varied. In the absence of manipulation, these lakes were net heterotrophic according to all three approaches. NEP (NEP = GPP-R) was consistently negative and averaged -35.5 +/- 3.7 (standard error) mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Nutrient enrichment, in the absence of strong planktivory, tended to cause increases in estimates of both GPP and R (estimated from the continuous O-2 data) but resulted in little change in the GPP/R ratio, which remained <1, or NEP, which remained negative. When planktivorous fish dominated the food web, large zooplankton were rare and nutrient enrichment produced positive values of NEP by all three methods. Among lakes and years, daily values of NEP ranged from -241 to +175 mmol m(-2) d(-1); mean seasonal NEP was positive only under a combination of high nutrient loading and a planktivore-dominated food web. Community R is significantly subsidized by allochthonous sources of organic matter in these lakes. Combining all lakes and years, we estimate that <similar to>26 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) of allochthonous origin is respired on average. This respiration of allochthonous organic matter represents 13 to 43% of total R, and this fraction declines with increasing GPP.

Are cladoceran fossils in lake sediment samples a biased reflection of the communities from which they are derived?	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A study on the taphonomy of Cladocera was carried out in a small (9 ha), oligotrophic mountain loch, Loch Coire Fionnaraich (LCFR) in northwest Scotland. Four approaches were used. First, the fossil assemblage of Cladocera in the core-top sample taken from the deepest basin (14 m) of the loch were compared with the fossil assemblages of Cladocera in surface sediments along eight depth transects with samples taken at 2, 5, 8 and 11 m, respectively. The results of the deposition of remains of individual Cladocera and of the PCA ordination showed that littoral Cladocera were dominant in the 2 m-depth samples, while the planktonic Cladocera dominated the deeper water (8, 11 m and core-top) samples. Second, the fossil assemblages of Cladocera in the core-top sample were compared with the assemblages in a sediment trap sample. The core-top sample showed a better representation of the cladoceran taxa present in the loch than the trap sample, but rare taxa were missing in the core sample. Third, the fossil assemblages of Cladocera in the core sample were compared with the contemporary assemblages in the source samples derived from seasonal sampling across all habitats (macrophyte, sand, boulder) over 2 years. Only a small proportion of Cladocera in the source samples was represented by the fossil assemblages in the core sample. Finally, 'integrated' approach samples (spatial, trap, source and core together) were compared using PCA. The Cladocera in the core-top sample were closely related to the trap and surface sediment samples, but weakly related to the source samples. The overall results indicate that biases may occur whilst reconstructing the past environmental change based on the fossil assemblages of Cladocera in the core sample taken from the deepest basin of the lake.

Seasonal variations in the biochemical composition of the crayfish Parastacus defossus (Crustacea, Decapoda) in its natural environment	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												The crayfish Parastacus defossus occurs in Uruguay and the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. It lives in swamps and lakes, where it digs sloped subterranean tunnels that are used as burrows. Because there is little information about the biology, physiology and ecology of this species, the aim of this study was to identify the seasonal variations of its carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Crayfish were collected monthly (from November 2002 to February 2004) in the Lami region, Porto Alegre municipality (30 degrees 11'41 '' S - 51 degrees 06'00 '' W). Haemolymph samples, used for determination of glucose, total proteins, triglycerides, total cholesterol and total lipids, were collected in the field using potassium oxalate as an anti-clotting agent. The animals and haemolymph samples were immediately frozen in the field. In the laboratory, the hepatopancreas, gills and abdominal muscles were removed for determination of glycogen, triglycerides, total cholesterol and total lipids. The findings suggest that in P. defossus, lipids are an important reserve of energy used during reproduction in both males and females; whereas glycogen may be used during periods of intense activity or environmental stress.

J	Reynolds, CS				Reynolds, Colin S.			A Changing Paradigm of Pelagic Food Webs	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												The paper catalogues the development of knowledge that has increasingly challenged the conventional understanding (the paradigm) that the predominant pathway of energy flow in pelagic systems is founded on the primary production of phytoplankton, its consumption by herbivorous zooplankton and, in turn, the feeding of larger carnivorous animals, including fish of commercial value. Aquatic food webs are now recognised to be more diverse in their carbon sources, more complex in structure and more versatile in their function. Adjacent terrestrial catchments supply nutrients and, crucially, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon. Pivotal roles in the processing of autochthonous organic carbon are often fulfilled by pelagic microbes and bacterivorous nanoplankton and microplankton. Mesozooplankton consumes algae directly if sufficiently concentrated but is itself a limiting resource to pelagic fish, which either must be specially adapted to gather sufficient zooplankton or must switch to benthic or littoral foods. Opportunistic feeding by such fish, though primarily nourished in the inshore, continues to control abundant zooplankton. Mobility and dietary electivity of adult fish integrate the pelagic food web into that of the benthos.

The effect of reservoirs on the climatology of warm-season thunderstorms in Southeast Texas, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Although ample research suggests that urban environments and their associated land use/land cover modify convective precipitation patterns, little research has explored the role of human-made bodies of water - artificial reservoirs - on thunderstorm climatology. This study provides the first radar-derived climatological analysis of the impact of artificial reservoirs on warm-season convective initiation (CI) and associated thunderstorms. An area centred on three large reservoirs in Southeast Texas is examined to explore how the artificial bodies of water influence the spatiotemporal nature of deep, moist convection. A thunderstorm day and CI climatology for the study domain is constructed utilizing composite radar reflectivity data from 1997 to 2013. The results illustrate enhanced (reduced) convective activity on the edges of (atop) the reservoirs. The presence of the reservoirs also induced increased variability in thunderstorm occurrence compared to areas with no reservoirs. In addition, spatial analytical testing yields statistically significant higher densities of CI events on the southern shores of the reservoirs. Evidence that relatively small bodies of water can influence regional convective patterns and modify the risk of thunderstorm hazards is presented.

Diffusive emission of methane and carbon dioxide from two hydropower reservoirs in Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The role of greenhouse gas emissions from freshwater reservoirs and their contribution to increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere is currently under discussion in many parts of the world. We studied CO2 and CH4 diffusive fluxes from two large neotropical hydropower reservoirs with different climate conditions. We used floating closed-chambers to estimate diffusive fluxes of these gaseous species. Sampling campaigns showed that the reservoirs studied were sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In the Serra da Mesa Reservoir, the CH4 emissions ranged from 0.530 to 396.96 mg.m(-2).d(-1) and CO2 emissions ranged from -1,738.33 to 11,166.61 mg.m(-2).d(-1) and in Tres Marias Reservoir the CH4 fluxes ranged 0.720 to 2,578.03 mg.m(-2).d(-1) and CO2 emission ranged from -3,037.80 to 11,516.64 to mg.m(-2).d(-1). There were no statistically significant differences of CH4 fluxes between the reservoirs, but CO2 fluxes from the two reservoirs studied were significantly different. The CO2 emissions measured over the periods studied in Serra da Mesa showed some seasonality with distinctions between the wet and dry transition season. In Tres Marias Reservoir the CO2 fluxes showed no seasonal variability. In both reservoirs, CH4 emissions showed a tendency to increase during the study periods but this was not statistically significant. These results contributed to increase knowledge about the magnitude of CO2 and CH4 emission in hydroelectric reservoirs, however due to natural variability of the data future sampling campaigns will be needed to better elucidate the seasonal influences on the fluxes of greenhouse gases.					; Santos, Marco/HGF-1439-2022; Layter Xavier, Vinicius/HNI-9676-2023	dos Santos, Marco Aurelio/0000-0002-2422-3765; Xavier, Vinicius Layter/0000-0002-7290-0652; 													1519-6984	1678-4375				MAY	2015	75	2					331	338		10.1590/1519-6984.12313	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.12313								26132015					WOS:000357522100011
J	Fetahi, T; Mengistou, S; Schagerl, M				Fetahi, Tadesse; Mengistou, Seyoum; Schagerl, Michael			Zooplankton community structure and ecology of the tropical-highland Lake Hayq, Ethiopia	LIMNOLOGICA												Lake Hayq, a highland lake in Ethiopia, was stocked with Tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) in late 1970s, offering an opportunity to study the effect of fish predation in a natural lake. Since 1930s, some limnological surveys have been done sporadically documenting a change in zooplankton composition including the disappearance of cladocerans, hypothesizing the stocked planktivorous fish could be a cause. Nevertheless, no detailed research was conducted to identify potential effects of fish stocking predominantly due to its remote location. The article presents data about zooplankton composition, abundance and biomass done between October 2007 and January 2009 on short-time intervals including the underlying limnological variables. The zooplankton community was depauperate comprising two copepods, three cladocerans, and six rotifers taxa, as typical for tropical lakes. Total mean standing biomass of all crustacean zooplankton was 237 mg dry mass m(-3), which gave Lake Hayq an intermediate position when compared with other tropical lakes. Of copepods, Thermocyclops ethiopiensis was almost an exclusive species, and its temporal variation was influenced by food supply and water temperature. We refute the hypothesis that Tilapia was the cause for the seasonal disappearance of cladocerans, and attribute it to the adverse effect of episodic mixing. Nevertheless, the planktivorous fish probably plays a key role in structuring the cladocerans in particular the large-sized Daphnia magna. In January 2008, we observed a massive planktivorous fish mortality that triggered high algal biomass, which was later grazed by large-sized D. magna demonstrating the trophic cascade hypothesis in a natural ecosystem.

Impact assessment of heavy metal pollution of Shahpura lake, Bhopal, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Monitoring and Assessment of water has become environmental concern due to the contamination by man kind. One of the most important crises of the 21(st) century is the availability of drinking water, a resource basic to our survival and growth. Most of the fresh water bodies all over the world are getting polluted thus decreasing the suitability of the fresh water. The area of the study, selected to estimate the levels of water pollution is the Shahpura lake of Bhopal, the state capital of Madhya Pradesh Province of India. The area under study receives domestic raw sewage from surrounding habitation; so also the activities like cattle washing, cloth washing, bathing, religious activities like idol immersion etc paves the way for high concentration of harmful chemicals in the lake water. Parameters like water temperature, concentration of heavy metals like lead, copper, cadmium, manganese, chromium were studied every month for a period of six months and seasonal variations were observed in each of them using standard methods. It was found that the concentration of the heavy metals in the lake water substantially increased after the religious activities like idol immersion around August and September. These heavy metals have a marked effect on the aquatic flora and fauna which through bio magnification enter the food chain and ultimately affect the human beings as well.

Evaluation of spatio-temporal variations in chlorophyll-a in Lake Naivasha, Kenya: remote-sensing approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Restoration of the ecosystem services and functions of lakes requires an understanding of the turbidity dynamics in order to arrive at informed environmental management decisions. The understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of turbidity requires frequent monitoring of the turbidity components such as chlorophyll-a concentration. In this study, we explored the use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS-Aqua) satellite data in studying the spatio-temporal changes in chlorophyll-a concentration in Lake Naivasha, a turbid tropical system. The temporal trend of chlorophyll-a concentration over the study period in the lake was also evaluated. The temporal trend assessment was achieved through the removal of periodic seasonal interference using Seasonal-Trend decomposition based on the LOESS (Local Regression) procedure. The resultant chlorophyll-a concentration maps derived from MODIS-Aqua satellite data give an indication of the monthly spatial variation in chlorophyll-a concentration from 2002 to 2012. The results of regression analyses between satellite-derived chlorophyll-a and in situ measurements reveal a high level of precision, but with a measureable bias with the satellite underestimating actual in situ measurements (R-2=0.65, P<0.001). Although the actual values of the chlorophyll-a concentrations are underestimated, the significant relationship between satellite-derived chlorophyll-a and in situ measurements provides reliable information for studying spatial variations and temporal trends. In 2009 and 2010, it was difficult to detect chlorophyll-a from the MODIS-Aqua imagery, and this coincided with a period of the lowest water levels in Lake Naivasha. An inverse relationship between de-seasoned water level and chlorophyll-a concentration was evident. This study shows that MODIS-Aqua satellite data provide useful information on the spatio-temporal variations in Lake Naivasha, which is useful in establishing general trends that are more difficult to determine through routine ground measurements.					; Ndungu, Jane/H-4592-2019	Ndungu, Jane/0000-0002-8004-6118; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				NOV 20	2013	34	22					8142	8155		10.1080/01431161.2013.833359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.833359													WOS:000324672800014

Due to the lack of up-to-date and detailed channel topographic/bathymetric data, a simplified flow model based on rating curves was developed to simulate discharges in the river system, and to further quantify and differentiate the contributions of river erosion and flow regulation of the TGR at a seasonal scale. The results indicate that the effect of channel alteration counteracts the effect of reservoir regulation in the high-flow periods. The impacts of TGR regulation on water diversions for both pre- and post-flood seasons were significant, but no obvious changes in the discharge diversion ratios were observed on an annual time scale.					; Chu, Xuefeng/H-7285-2012; xiang, fxiang/KHC-4997-2024	Chu, Xuefeng/0000-0003-0322-0271; Sun, Zhaohua/0000-0002-2410-3309													0262-6667	2150-3435				SEP 10	2019	64	12					1488	1503		10.1080/02626667.2019.1649410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.1649410		AUG 2019											WOS:000480756400001

Cyanobacterial bloom detection based on coherence between ferrybox observations	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Cyanobacterial bloom detection from flow-through optical sensors on ships-of-opportunity ('ferryboxes') is challenging in periods of strong stratification and due to varying cell physiology and phytoplankton community composition. Wavelet coherence analysis between ferrybox parameters (chlorophyll-a fluorescence, phycocyanin fluorescence, turbidity) was used to delineate blooms in a dataset of ten fenybox transects, recorded during the 2005 cyanobacterial bloom season in the Baltic Sea. Independent wind speed and sea-surface temperature data were used to classify areas of cyanobacterial dominance as mixed, stratified, or surfacing bloom. These classified subsets of fenybox observations were compared against remotely sensed chlorophyll-a concentrations, which resulted in a scheme for the interpretation of surface water phytoplankton biomass from multi-source observations. Ferryhox optical signals were significantly coherent from the onset until the end of the cyanobacterial bloom period under both stratified and mixed conditions. This suggests that the coherence analysis is sensitive to high-level community composition. Strongly stratified and suspected surfacing bloom was associated with unrealistically high remotely sensed chlorophyll-a estimates, indicating the need to flag stratified bloom areas when interpreting remote sensing imageiy. The ferrybox fluorescence and turbidity signals at the 5-m sampling depth were, paradoxically, low under these conditions, suggesting that direct comparison between remote sensing and flow-through observations is not useful for stratified blooms. Correlations between ferrybox measurements and remotely sensed observations improved consistently when stratified or surfacing cyanobacterial bloom was excluded from the regression. It is discussed how coherence analysis of fenybox observations can aid the interpretation of remotely sensed data in situations where meteorological observations suggest incomplete vertical mixing.

The water quality indices has been promoted with the aim of contribute with water condition reports to society, while multivariate techniques, such as discriminant analysis (DA) are tools that enable the analysis of large number of samples and factors that allow the identification of sources of pollution affecting the water characteristics and offer a valuable and reliable tool for the management of water resources. This study is the result of water quality evaluations corresponding to two periods (2005 and 2009-2010), and aims to compare the water quality of Yuriria lake before and after the actions taken for restoration; for this, 21 parameters were analyzed including a water quality index and DA to determine the spatial and temporal variation of water quality. Our results show that the lake has a high level of eutrophication, with organic matter and fecal pollution; temporal variations in water quality were found, that manifest the effect of drought and rainy seasons. A severe drought in the second period was detected, which contributed to the concentration of nutrients and other parameters like total suspended solids provided by the tributaries. It was detected that La Cinta channel provides water of low quality and that the existence of villages are a determinant factor in space water quality variations. No recovery was observed in water quality between the study periods. The effects of drought can mask the effects of the strategies, actions and measures taken for the preservation and restoration of Yuriria lake, so different management actions at the basin level are suggested to allow a faster and efficient recovery of the aquatic environment.

Evaluation of different strategies for management of reservoir sedimentation in semi-arid regions: a case study (Dez Reservoir)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Emamgholizadeh S, Bateni SM, Nielson JR. 2018. Evaluation of different strategies for management of reservoir sedimentation in semi-arid regions: a case study (Dez Reservoir). Lake Reserv Manage. 00:00-00.Reservoir sedimentation is a major concern, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, such as Iran. Dez Reservoir, with a primary storage capacity of 3315 x 10(6) m(3), located on the Dez River, is an important dam in Iran that suffers from sedimentation problems. Large volumes of sediments are impounded every year in this reservoir, particularly during hyper-concentrated floods. The accumulation of sediments in the Dez Reservoir has negatively impacted its utilities, such as power generation, flood control, and water supply. In this study, several different strategies of sedimentation management were assessed, including watershed management, sluicing, flushing, density current venting, and bypass. The results show that sedimentation in the Dez Reservoir can be reduced by 11-15% by venting density currents, which entails discharging incoming density currents through irrigation gates before they get impounded in the reservoir. Sedimentation can be reduced by approximately 2% by pressure flushing, which would decrease sediment depositions near the power plant intake. By construction of a submerged dam 9km upstream of Dez Dam Reservoir, the bypass technique can be used to release 10.8 x 10(6) m(3) of sediments per year and discharge turbid flow during the flood season. Finally, implementing watershed management strategies in the Sezar catchment could reduce the inflowing sediment to Dez Reservoir by 15%. Dez Reservoir does not have sluice gates and, therefore, the free flushing and sluicing methods cannot be used as mitigation strategies.					; Emamgholizadeh, Samad/GQQ-9160-2022	Emamgholizadeh, Samad/0000-0002-1681-9454; Bateni, Sayed/0000-0002-7134-0067													1040-2381	2151-5530					2018	34	3					270	282		10.1080/10402381.2018.1436624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2018.1436624													WOS:000445258100005

The potential of Earth Observation in modelling nutrient loading and water quality in lakes of southern Quebec, Canada	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Phosphorus and nitrogen are key nutrients that affect abundance and growth of aquatic primary producers but cannot be directly remotely sensed as their dissolved or organic forms do not interact with the remote sensing signal. In addition, other lake water quality variables such as chlorophyll a and Secchi disk depth, have been previously successfully estimated with remote sensing, but the retrieval algorithms are site-, season-, and/or scene-specific. Such algorithms do not take into account lake typological features, which can affect the sensitivity of lake to change, or catchment characteristics, for example, land cover that is a major driver of lake water quality change. Here we propose a novel approach that utilises remotely sensed land cover information in the catchment to estimate phosphorus, nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations in lake waters. We use land cover type-specific nutrient export coefficients and the NASA MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Land Cover Type product showing that nutrient loading based on remote sensing can explain up to 75% of variability in lake nutrient concentrations and 58% of variability in lake chlorophyll a concentrations. In addition, we show that land cover information, supplemented by satellite measurements and lake morphometry data are good predictors of chlorophyll a (R-2 = 0.77) and Secchi disk depth (R-2 = 0.87) in lakes with different trophic statuses and in different months and years.

The aim here is to assess the ecological status of three lakes and six reservoirs in the western Mediterranean Basin of Turkey using a multivariate approach and phytoplankton indices. Water and phytoplankton samples were collected seasonally from June 2014 to August 2015. The environmental variables, e.g., pH, total phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen (N-NO3), orthophosphate (P-PO4), and conductivity have a significant effect on the distribution of phytoplankton. The relationship between the phyto-plankton community composition and environmental variables was investigated using a canonical correspondence analysis, which shows a 93.2 % correspondence between species-environmental correlations, and 13.6 % of the cumulative percentage variance of species data. The phytoplankton trophic index (PTI) changed from 2.48 in Lake Golhisar to 1.96 in the Cavdir reservoir, while values of the Mediterranean phytoplankton trophic index (Med-PTO ranged from 2.05 in the Toptas reservoir to 0.80 in Lake Yazir. The ecological quality ratio (EQR) based on the PTI indicates that the studied lakes and reservoirs were at the medium ecological status, except the Caybogazi and Yaprakh reservoirs, which had a good status. In contrast, the EQR based on the Med-PTI indicates that the Lakes Golhisar, Avlan and Yazir had a high, good and medium status, respectively. From these results, both indices seem to be appropriate metrics for assessing the ecological status of reservoirs and lakes in the western Mediterranean Basin.					; Çetin, Tolga/HLP-9596-2023; LEKESIZ, Omer/AAK-4391-2021; Çelekli, Abuzer/P-9845-2015	Toudjani, Assane Anabi/0000-0002-6101-4284; LEKESIZ, H.Omer/0000-0003-2982-0136; Celekli, Abuzer/0000-0002-2448-4957													1863-9135					JAN	2018	191	2					155	167		10.1127/fal/2018/1092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2018/1092													WOS:000431859000006

In terms of river-lake system connectivity, the natural connectivity between rivers and lakes ensures the smooth flow of water and water between rivers and lakes, and maintains the minimum water storage capacity of lakes and the exchange of nutrients between rivers and lakes. In terms of connectivity between the river and the floodplain, the connection between the river channel and the beach zone allows the flood season to overflow the main channel and flood the beach area, transport nutrients for the beach, and promote the growth of the beach vegetation. River and lake connectivity is one of the important reasons that affect ecological carrying capacity and ecological security. Rivers and lakes are divided into structural connectivity and material-energy connectivity. This paper establishes a vertical, horizontal and vertical structure connectivity index system based on ecological carrying capacity and ecological security Through the hydrological and geomorphological, water quality and river biological indicators system, the importance of the material-energy connectivity of rivers and lakes to ecological carrying capacity and ecological security is analyzed. The following conclusions have been drawn: The assessment of the connectivity of rivers and lakes is an important aspect of assessing ecological carrying capacity and ecological security The construction of a complete evaluation system for rivers and lakes connectivity is of great significance in evaluating ecological carrying capacity and ecological security.

In this study, we made spatial and temporal measurements of CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) along the Three Gorges Dam system. The pCO(2) ranged from 619 to 2383 mu atm and was supersaturated relative to atmospheric CO2. Further,pCO(2) showed obvious spatial and temporal variations: pCO(2) at the high-flow season was much lower than that at the low-flow season near the upstream part of the reservoir, whereas pCO(2) in the reservoir water and after the dam showed an opposite seasonal trend. Organic matter mineralization produced more CO2 in the surface water of the reservoir area at the high-flow season and should be responsible for the delta C-13-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DE)). In addition, organic carbon mineralization is sensitive to temperature variability, which is expected to be an important driver of the dissolved CO2 over-saturation in the reservoir. This study suggested that the construction of Three Gorges Reservoir increased the water transit time and accelerated the organic carbon mineralization in the Changjiang River. The results indicate that carbon cycling changes markedly in large impounded rivers.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) specific for Actinobacteria was used to investigate phylogenetic diversity and seasonal dynamics of actinobacterial communities in the epilimnion of all lakes (inter-lake variability) and to assess differences between Actinobacteria communities of the epi-, meta- and hypolimnion of a single lake (intra-lake variability) respectively. DGGE analyses showed significant inter- and intra-lake differences between Actinobacteria communities of all lakes and water layers as well as between free-living and particle-associated Actinobacteria. Phylogenetic inferences of 16S rRNA gene sequences suggest that particular members of particle-associated Actinobacteria were exclusively affiliated to certain actinobacterial lineages. The phylogenetic comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences of all lakes and water layer, however, indicated the occurrence of almost similar phylogenetic lineages in all studied habitats and suggest high intracluster diversity within already known actinobacterial lineages. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination analyses and Pearson's product moment correlations revealed several strong correlations between the investigated Actinobacteria communities and various limnological parameters, such as conductivity, total phosphorous, alkalinity or primary production. However, no uniform correlation patterns were found between lakes, water layers and bacterial fractions. These heterogeneous correlation patterns together with the phylogenetic similarities of Actinobacteria communities from different lakes indicate that particular Actinobacteria represent various ecotypes or exhibit a pronounced ecophysiological plasticity.

The provenance of Kul Tepe obsidian artifacts: Syunik and the highlands of Armenia as possible seasonal pastureland	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												Excavations at the site of Kul Tepe in the Jolfa region in north-western Iran have unearthed various archaeological materials from Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic to Achaemenid periods (end of 6th millennium to 3rd century BC). During the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age most lithic tools used in Kul Tepe were made of obsidian. From the first and second excavation seasons, 53 and 32 obsidian samples were selected and analyzed by pXRF. According to the results, the main source of obsidian for the workshops in Kul Tepe was Syunik, but other sources in the Lake Sevan Basin like Ghegam, Bazenk, Choraphor and Gutansar and the Lake Van region (Nemrut Dag and Meydan Dag) were utilized also.

The present study on the physico-chemical parameters of water quality of sacred lake Nachiketa Tal of Garhwal Himalaya was undertaken. During the period from May 2015 to April 2016 at four sampling stations, seasonal variations in air temperature, water temperature, electrical conductivity, turbidity, salinity, TDS, dissolved oxygen, free CO2, hardness, alkalinity, nitrates, phosphates, chlorides, calcium and magnesium were recorded. The statistical correlation and cluster analysis between the various physico-chemical parameters of Nachiketa Tal were computed. The results of this study revealed that the concentration of the nutrients, turbidity, electrical conductivity, TDS increased with a decreasing trend of dissolved oxygen in all the sampling stations during the monsoon season. Thus, degradation in the water quality of the lake was resulted in the monsoon season.																			2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2018	8	6							164	10.1007/s13201-018-0802-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-018-0802-y													WOS:000445184100003

Microcystin concentrations in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) caught from Murchison Bay, Lake Victoria and Lake Mburo: Uganda	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Catches of the economically important Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) from two eutrophic tropical lakes in Uganda, Lake Mburo and Murchison Bay, Lake Victoria, were examined to determine the presence of microcystins (MCs) in gut, liver and muscle of the fish. Analysis for MCs (RR, LR and YR) in both fish and water samples was by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) method. Physico-chemical parameters were also measured to establish the status of both lakes. MC-RR was the most prominent MC detected in Lake Mburo and Murchison Bay samples, there was no evidence of significant seasonal variation in the concentration of MCs in fish tissue. MCs were detected in all water samples from both study lakes. The mean concentration of MCs in water was found higher in dry times for Lake Mburo (P < 0.05) and higher in wet times for Murchison Bay (P < 0.05). MC concentrations in the fish guts were positively related with MC concentrations in water samples from Murchison bay (P < 0.05), no such correlation was found in Lake Mburo. In eutrophic tropical lakes, fish seem to have a high tolerance to the toxicity of cyanotoxins including MCs. However, there is a possibility of accumulating these toxins in their tissue with the threat of transferring them higher up in the food chain. Due to a low sample size and short sampling period, the results can only serve to highlight the potential risk of MC accumulation in Nile tilapia in these lakes. Further studies are needed for the purpose of risk assessment.					; Nyakairu, George/MXM-2008-2025	NYAKAIRU, George William Atwoki/0000-0002-1314-608X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2010	638	1					235	244		10.1007/s10750-009-0047-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-0047-8													WOS:000273244000019

A relatively long-term dataset of biotic and abiotic parameters of water quality in the river was subjected to correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA). The results indicate that water temperature and TN/TP (total nitrogen divided by total phosphates) are key regulatory factors for phytoplankton abundance. The results of the correlation analysis and RDA suggest that temperature is a key regulatory factor for phytoplankton community composition and algae-bloom dominance in flood season; TN/TP and TN play governing roles in phytoplankton dynamics during the normal season; and transparency, TP and dissolved oxygen contributed significantly to phytoplankton community composition during the dry season.

Different P forms were related to chemical and physical properties of the sediments and the chemistry of pore water and near-bottom water. Sediment P composition varied among the sampling sites located in the Archipelago Sea (AS) and along the northern coast of the Gulf of Finland (GoF): the organic rich sites were high in organic P (OP), while apatite-P dominated in the area affected by sediment transportation. Although the near-bottom water was oxic, the sediments released P. Release of P was most pronounced at the site with high sediment OP and reduced conditions in the sediment-water interface, indicating that P had its origins in organic sources as well as in reducible iron (Fe) oxyhydroxides. The results suggest that even though these coastal areas are shallow enough to lack salinity stratification typical for the brackish BS, they are vulnerable to seasonal oxygen (O-2) depletion and P release because of their patchy bottom topography, which restricts mixing of water. Furthermore, coastal basins accumulate organic matter (OM) and OP, degradation of which further diminishes O-2 and creates the potential for P release from the sediment. In these conditions, an abundance of labile OP may cause marked efflux of P from sediment reserves in the long-term.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				JUN	2009	94	2					141	162		10.1007/s10533-009-9315-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9315-y													WOS:000266644300004

Variability of phytoplankton pigment ratios across aquatic environments	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The majority of phytoplankton pigment studies are from marine, estuarine and oceanic waters, and commonly use estimates of the ratio between marker pigments and chlorophyll a (chl a) for calculating the contribution of phytoplankton groups to total chl a. In this study, we examined pigment ratios obtained with CHEMTAX processing of field data from a range of tropical and temperate freshwater bodies with contrasting water transparency, depth of the mixed layer, and trophic state. The pigment ratios obtained from processing data from fresh waters corresponded quite well with existing values from pure cultures, and were compared with the marine marker pigment: chl a ratio calculated with CHEMTAX using identical procedures. In deep, stratifying lakes a large variation of some pigment ratios with depth was observed, as well as seasonal variation relating to changes in water column structure. There was considerable variation of average phytoplankton pigment ratios among the freshwater bodies studied. Pigment ratios were significantly correlated to indicators of nutrient availability, to depth of the euphotic zone, or to a proxy of light availability. The substantial variation in marker pigment: chl a ratio confirms that algorithms which account for natural variation of pigments in phytoplankton groups are required for accurate assessment of phytoplankton groups based on marker pigment concentration alone.

AQUATIC SCIENCES												Global warming is expected to influence lake gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R) by increasing water temperature and terrestrial export of organic material and inorganic nutrients from the catchment. We experimentally tested the effects of warming (3 A degrees C) and natural humic river runoff, separately and in combination, on habitat-specific and whole ecosystem net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP - R) in replicated large scale (136 m(3)) experimental pond ecosystems over one open water season. Pelagic NEP was reduced by warming and increased with humic river water addition. Littoral NEP (benthos, macrophytes, periphyton) showed an opposite pattern with increasing NEP following warming and decreasing NEP following humic river water addition. These changes were a result of changes in GPP with warming (negative in pelagic, positive in littoral) and with humic water addition (positive in pelagic, negative in littoral), while no effects were observed on pelagic respiration. As a result of the counteracting effects on NEP in pelagic and littoral habitats, whole ecosystem NEP was not affected by the treatments. The study suggests that climate mediated changes in temperature and river runoff have relatively small effects on the overall metabolic balance of shallow aquatic ecosystems but there may be large habitat-specific effects.					de Vasconcelos, Francisco/C-1642-2014	Rivera de Vasconcelos, Francisco/0000-0002-2327-9716; Rodriguez, Patricia/0000-0002-7134-8966													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2016	78	4					717	725		10.1007/s00027-015-0463-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-015-0463-y													WOS:000382681000008

Model Results of Deposition and Incorporation Processes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In previous work, Alpine glaciers have been identified as a secondary source of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). However, detailed understanding of the processes organic chemicals undergo in a glacial system was missing. Here, we present results from a chemical fate model describing deposition and incorporation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into an Alpine glacier (Fiescherhorn, Switzerland) and an Arctic glacier (Lomonosovfonna, Norway). To understand PCB fate and dynamics, we investigate the interaction of deposition, sorption to ice and particles in the atmosphere and within the glacier, revolatilization, diffusion and degradation, and discuss the effects of these processes on the fate of individual PCB congeners. The model is able to reproduce measured absolute concentrations in the two glaciers for most PCB congeners. While the model generally predicts concentration profiles peaking in the 1970s, in the measurements, this behavior can only be seen for higher-chlorinated PCB congeners on Fiescherhorn glacier. We suspect seasonal melt processes are disturbing the concentration profiles of the lower-chlorinated PCB congeners. While a lower-chlorinated PCB congener is mainly deposited by dry deposition and almost completely revolatilized after deposition, a higher-chlorinated PCB congener is predominantly transferred to the glacier surface by wet deposition and then is incorporated into the glacier ice. The incorporated amounts of PCBs are higher on the Alpine glacier than on the Arctic glacier due to the higher precipitation rate and aerosol particle concentration on the former. Future studies should include the effects of seasonal melt processes, calculate the quantities of PCBs incorporated into the entire glacier surface, and estimate the quantity of chemicals released from glaciers to determine the importance of glaciers as a secondary source of organic chemicals to remote aquatic ecosystems.					; Steinlin, Christine/HGA-3424-2022	Schwikowski, Margit/0000-0002-0856-5183; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 15	2014	48	14					7849	7857		10.1021/es501793h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es501793h								24999726					WOS:000339227500023

Under the agreement, cities and counties served by the agency would have their water supply demands met unequivocally and share the cost of delivery and/or development of new supplies based on their consumption, allowing a more holistic approach to manage resources in the region. Consequently, the agency was able to plan and execute several components of its Long-Term Master Water Plan to meet the region's demand, as well as diversify its sources of water supply. Today, the agency manages a diverse and regionally interconnected water supply system that includes 13 wellfields, two surface water supply sources, off-site reservoir storage, a sea water desalination plant, a surface water treatment plant, and 14 pumping/booster stations. It delivers water through 390 km of large diameter pipe to 19 potable water connections. It uses state-of-the-practice computer tools to manage short and long-term operations and planning. As a result, after the agency's inception, groundwater pumpage was reduced by more than half in less than a decade-by far one of the largest cutback and smaller groundwater utilization rate compared to other utilities in Florida or elsewhere. The region was able to witness a remarkable recovery in lake and wetland water levels through the agency's use of this diverse mix of supply sources. For example, in the last three years, 45-65% of water supply came from groundwater sources, 35-45% from surface water sources and 1-9% from desalinated seawater-very different from 100% groundwater only supply just few years ago. As an "on demand" wholesale water provider, the agency forecasts water supply availability and expected water demands from seasonal to decadal time frames using a suite of forecasting tools and a structured decision-making process. This paper presents a case study of the approach taken by Tampa Bay Water to meet the region's growing water demands while satisfying other competing objectives in a sustainable fashion and documents the remarkable environmental improvement observed in the area.

Growth response of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to catch-and-release angling: a 27-year mark-recapture study	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Catch-and-release angling is gaining popularity worldwide and plays an increasingly important role in both fisheries management and conservation. Mortality from catch-and-release angling is well documented across species, but the sublethal effects have not been evaluated in a natural setting. Laboratory studies have yielded mixed results regarding catch-and-release impacts on fish growth. These studies do not adequately capture the scales of stress and variability of a natural system. We used a 27-year mark-recapture study of 1050 individually tagged largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to determine the effects of catch-and-release angling on the growth in a natural setting. Individual bass were angled one to six times per season. Recapture intervals ranged from 1 to 98 days. Largemouth bass exhibited a post-release period (similar to 6 days) of weight loss. Following this weight loss, we observed a subsequent period of compensatory growth facilitating recovery to normal weight. We found that catch-and-release angling had little impact on the overall seasonal growth patterns of largemouth bass and therefore should have limited adverse effects on growth-dependent ecological functions.

This paper focuses on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport and its delta C-13 isotopic signature. The delta(13) C-DIC values vary between -12.8 and -1.8% and allow one to distinguish two river groups: (i) the Colorado, Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, which display the highest values and the lowest seasonal variations; (ii) the Deseado, Coyle, Chico and Gallegos, which show the lowest values and the highest seasonal variations. For the first group, delta C-13(DIC) is mainly controlled by important exchanges between the river waters and atmospheric CO2, due to the presence of lakes and dams. For the second group, delta(13) C-DIC also appears to be controlled by the oxidation of organic carbon, showing a negative relationship between delta 13 C-DIC and the dissolved organic carbon. These biogeochemical processes interfere with the contribution of carbonate and silicate weathering to the riverine DIC and do not allow use of delta(13) C-DIC alone to distinguish these contributions. The annual DIC flux exported by Patagonian Rivers to the South Atlantic Ocean averages 621 x 10(9) g. of C, i.e. a specific yield of 2-7 g m(-2) year(-1). The mean delta C-13(DIC) can be estimated to -4.9%, which is high compared with other rivers of the world. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A large knowledge gap on diet and seasonal changes in forage availability limits the ability to develop informed local management plans for the African manatee in much of its range. This research took place in the Sanaga River Watershed, which includes two protected areas in the Littoral Region of Cameroon: the Douala-Edea National Park and the Lake Ossa Wildlife Reserve. We analyzed 113 manatee fecal samples and surveyed shoreline emergent and submerged vegetation within the Sanaga River Watershed. We used microhistological analyses to determine the relative contribution of each plant species to African manatee diets and compared across locations and across seasons (wet vs. dry season). We found that the shoreline vegetation is diverse with over 160 plant species, unevenly distributed across space and season, and dominated by emergent vegetation mostly represented by the antelope grass (Echinochloa pyramidalis). We recorded a total of 36 plant species from fecal samples with a spatial and temporal distribution mostly reflecting that of the corresponding shoreline vegetation. African manatees appear to be primarily opportunistically feeding on available vegetation across the seasons and habitat. This work documents the current, but changing, state of plant availability in the Sanaga River Watershed and reports the African manatee diet in Cameroon for the first time. This information can play a critical role in successfully managing the species and these protected areas. If we wish to protect the African manatee and the aquatic ecosystems within the Sanaga River Watershed, we must understand how forage availability changes over time, especially as its waters become nutrient enriched, eutrophic, and exposed to invasive species of plants in a changing world.

Increasing irrigation and domestic water use, change in the local climate and changes in the surrounding land cover are believed to be the causes of Lake Alemaya's demise. Expansion of major irrigated crops in particular chat (Catha Edulis), potato and vegetables and non-judicious use of irrigation water in the Lake Alemaya watershed led to presumption that irrigation is partly responsible for the withdrawal of large quantity of water from the lake. Thus, water balance study of Lake Alemaya was carried out under presumed scenarios in order to study the possible trends and fluctuations of the lake water level in response to proposed scenarios. Further, it is essential to study the irrigation performance for developing optimal irrigation schedules in the study area to make the best use of available water for long term sustainability of the water resources of Lake Alemaya. It was identified that expansion of the irrigated area in general and chat cultivation in particular in the study area have been the key to sustainable management of lake water, hence its expansion during the past 37 years (1965-2002) was studied through interpretation of satellite data. Subsequently, performance evaluation of the small-scale irrigation practices for major irrigated crops was carried out. Optimal irrigation schedules for different crop seasons were also developed for these irrigated crops using CROPWAT software. It was found that chat area increased from 190 ha in 1996 to nearly 330 ha in 2002. Further, it was observed that 43% surface area of the lake has reduced within a span of 37 years. Overall, maximum irrigation intensity of chat, potato and vegetables is observed during the first irrigation season of the crop calendar. Particularly, in case of chat, irrigation performance indicators such as Relative Water Supply (RWS), Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS), Depleted Fraction (DF) and Overall Consumed Ratio (OCR) values indicated poor performance of irrigation practices. From the analysis, it was found that the application of a fixed irrigation depth and fixed irrigation interval combinations of (25 mm-25 day), (20 mm-20 day), or (20 mm-25 day) are recommended for chat in the study area. Optimal irrigation schedules were decided on the basis of combination of irrigation interval and depth that results in low loss of irrigation water with reasonable yield reduction. Thus, determination of appropriate water management strategy can ensure proper utilization of the available water resources and improve the water application efficiency of the small-scale irrigation practices around Lake Alemaya, Ethiopia.

Numerous studies have quantified the load of dissolved solids in rivers that drain volcanic regions to determine chemical weathering rates and atmospheric CO2 consumption rates. However, the balance between thermal and non-thermal components to riverine fluxes in these areas remains poorly constrained, hindering accurate estimates of atmospheric CO2 consumption rates. Here we use the Ge/Si ratio and the stable silicon isotopes (delta Si-30) as tracers for quantifying non-thermal silicon contributions in rivers draining the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field, USA. The Ge/Si ratio (mu mol.mol(-1)) was determined for seven thermal water samples (183 +/- 22), eight rivers (35 +/- 23) and six creeks flowing into Yellowstone Lake (5 +/- 3) during base flow and during peak water discharge following snowmelt. The delta Si-30 value (parts per thousand) was determined for thermal waters (-0.09 +/- 0.04), Yellowstone River at Yellowstone Lake outlet (1.91 +/- 0.23) and creek samples (0.82 +/- 0.29). The calculated atmospheric CO2 consumption associated with non-thermal waters flowing through Yellowstone's rivers during peak discharge is similar to 3.03 ton.km(-2).yr(-1), which is similar to 2% of the annual mean atmospheric CO2 consumption in other volcanic regions. This study highlights the significance of quantifying seasonal variations in chemical weathering rates for improving estimates of atmospheric CO2 consumption rates in active volcanic regions.					; Zahajska, Petra/S-3983-2017; Zahajská, Petra/S-3983-2017; McCleskey, Richard/AAZ-3320-2020; Opfergelt, Sophie/L-2107-2015	Delmelle, Pierre/0000-0001-8606-829X; Zahajska, Petra/0000-0001-5858-0616; McCleskey, Richard/0000-0002-2521-8052; Opfergelt, Sophie/0000-0002-1773-4823; Gaspard, Francois/0000-0002-0046-4142														1525-2027				NOV	2021	22	11							e2021GC009904	10.1029/2021GC009904	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021GC009904													WOS:000723103400022

The major source of kinetic energy is wind forcing at the water surface. Although a small portion of the vertical wind energy flux in the atmosphere is transferred to water, it is crucial for physical, biogeochemical and ecological processes in lentic ecosystems. To examine energy fluxes and energy content in surface and internal waves, we analyze extensive datasets of air- and water-side measurements collected at two small water bodies (<10 km(2)). For the first time we use directly measured atmospheric momentum fluxes. The estimated energy fluxes and content agree well with results reported for larger lakes, suggesting that the energetics governing water motions in enclosed basins is similar, independent of basin size. The largest fraction of wind energy flux is transferred to surface waves and increases strongly nonlinearly for wind speeds exceeding 3 m s(-1). The energy content is largest in basin-scale and high-frequency internal waves but shows seasonal variability and varies among aquatic systems. At one of the study sites, energy dissipation rates varied diurnally, suggesting biogenic turbulence, which appears to be a widespread phenomenon in lakes and reservoirs.

In the present study, we assessed occurrence, composition, and risk assessment of PAHs in Wei River Basin. It was found that the total concentration ( n-ary sumation (16)PAHs) of selected PAHs in sediments for the main stream of Wei River and its tributaries ranged from n.d. (not detectable) to 577.25 ng g(-1) and 36.35 to 2348.77 ng g(-1), respectively. The PAHs were mostly dominated by PHE and FLT. Based on the diagnostic ratios of FLT/(FLT + PYR), BaA/(BaA + CHR), and PCA analysis, we deducted that diesel emissions and incomplete combustion of petroleum fuels were predominant in the selected area. For sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), adverse effects of three PAHs (ACE, PHE, and BgP) in sediment were occasionally observed, while the other 9 PAHs were considered to occur rarely. The total carcinogenicity of PAHs assessed by TEQ(BaP) ranged from n.d. to 138.84 ng g(-1), and BaP played the dominant role. The ecological risk of individual PAHs (ACE, FLU, PHE, FLT, PYR, BaA, BbF, BaP) were moderate, while other compounds were negligible. Total ecological risk of n-ary sumation (16)PAHs posed low to moderate ecological risk in Wei River Basin.					liu, zhineng/HKZ-3999-2023; fang, lin chuan/K-4923-2013; Lu, Yuehan/M-8803-2015; Fang, Lin/HTN-5779-2023; Zhang, Yucheng/A-4523-2013; Shi, Yongfeng/KLC-6603-2024	fang, lin chuan/0000-0003-1923-7908; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				NOV	2021	232	11							476	10.1007/s11270-021-05403-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05403-w													WOS:000718086900001

The effects of trahira density (treatment groups: addition, removal, and reference) in two habitat categories (open and macrophyte-covered areas) on attributes of the fish assemblage structure were evaluated (using rm-ANOVA) over 120 days. Reductions in species richness were recorded in all assemblages and were more pronounced at the end of the experiment within macrophyte-covered areas of the lakes where H. aff. malabaricus was removed. In these lakes, the number of fish was also significantly smaller and evenness was significantly higher than in those in which trahira were added or maintained at natural densities. The increase of the relative abundance of all size classes over the first 60 days on the assemblages where trahira was present, and the decrease of the small-sized fish where trahira was absent contributed to the lack of pronounced alterations in total biomass. The absence of the predator from its preferred habitat was found to negatively affect the less abundant species, which seemed to be highly sensitive to the effects of interspecific competition among prey species. In addition to the well-known effects of hydrological seasonality, the role played by native predators might be important in determining the persistence of local species in the fish assemblages of Neotropical floodplains.					; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/D-5888-2013; Petry, Ana/J-6851-2012; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Agostinho, Angelo/S-1538-2019; Petry, Ana Cristina/J-6851-2012	gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444; Piana, Pitagoras Augusto/0000-0002-4666-6663; Petry, Ana Cristina/0000-0001-9039-2738													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2010	651	1					115	126		10.1007/s10750-010-0281-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0281-0													WOS:000278923600009

Rising river levels can create backwater effects, which substantially increase urban flood risks. Traditional water management approaches are limited by delayed monitoring data updates, slow flood forecasting processes, and inadequate decision support, making it difficult to address the complex, multi-objective demands of flood control. These limitations exacerbate flooding threats and hamper effective urban flood management. To address these challenges, a digital twin experimental platform for river and lake water systems was developed to enhance the comprehensive management of urban flood control and drainage. The platform integrates an engineering entity, a backend system, and a digital twin component. Real-time data acquisition and virtual-real interactions between physical facilities and the digital twin were achieved using Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technology, while the Unity3D engine enabled advanced visualization and data rendering. Furthermore, a novel model incorporating deep learning and a multi-objective optimization algorithm was proposed to optimize drainage pump scheduling rules. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate flood risks and operation and maintenance costs before and after optimization. The results demonstrated that the platform was well-designed for comprehensive flood protection and drainage management. The NSE coefficients for river and lake water levels exceeded 95.18 %, and the relative error in pump operation times remained below 4.11 % across various scenarios involving river inflows and drainage operations. The backwater effect at drainage outlets was primarily driven by river flow and downstream lake levels. The optimization strategy effectively balanced water level control and operational objectives, reducing water level targets by 24.99 %, 40.36 %, and 51.61 % under different scenarios. This framework not only offers innovative solutions for urban flood management but also provides strong technical support for optimizing flood control and drainage system operations.

The Menengai Caldera in the Kenya Great Rift Valley is one of the largest explored geothermal fields in the country. This paper presents a hydrochemical investigation of the Menengai Caldera geothermal field and the ground and surface waters of the surrounding Nakuru County. Our results demonstrated a similar, sodium-alkaline dominated, ionic composition across all water types. Geothermal wells return the highest cation/anion concentrations and largely demonstrate a meteoric source from their delta O-18 and delta H-2 signature. Wells MW-09 (central part of the caldera), MW-18 (eastern part) and MW-20 (central part) showed a more evaporitic signature, closely matching with our own calculated Lake Evaporation Line, suggesting an increased mixing influence of Lake Nakuru waters. MW-09 also showed evidence of high-temperature oxygen isotopic exchange and significant water-rock interaction. Lake samples largely demonstrated seasonal shifts in ionic and isotopic values. Lake Nakuru ionic composition and isotopic values increased throughout the 12-month wet-dry-wet season sampling period. This correlated with a decrease in area which suggests a lessening of water inflow and facilitates increased evaporation. Groundwaters demonstrated clear evidence of mixing between meteoric, irrigation and lake waters. These observations enhanced the understanding of the hydrological system surrounding the Menengai Caldera and, when combined with future studies, will provide a powerful tool to assess the sustainability and impact of soon-to-be completed geothermal power production operations.

Differential evolution of lifespan and fecundity between asexual and sexual females in a benign environment	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Here we report one of the first investigations of evolvability of lifespan and reproduction in metazoans, examining both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. We tested effects on senescence of an environmental variable (simulated lake hydroperiod, the length of time an aquatic habitat is inundated), female reproductive physiology (asexual females that reproduce by ameiosis, vs. sexual females reproducing by meiosis), and time in a benign culture environment (minimal, if any, external mortality factors). To do this we established chemostat cultures of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis s.s., and maintained the cultures for 385 days. Hydroperiod alone, or in interaction with the effects of reproductive physiology and time in the benign environment, had no significant effect on the rate of aging. Yet combining animals from both ephemeral and permanent hydroperiods revealed a 26% increase in asexual female lifespan across seasons (23% decrease in the rate of aging) and a 56% increase in asexual fecundity, suggesting that maintenance in benign laboratory conditions leads to slower aging. The relative stasis of traits for sexual in contrast to asexual females implies a role of reproductive physiology on evolvability. In addition we found a positive correlation between fecundity and lifespan, suggesting an absence of trade-offs in these life history traits in the benign laboratory environment.																			1434-2944	1522-2632				MAR	2014	99	1-2			SI		117	124		10.1002/iroh.201301711	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201301711								24795527					WOS:000333163800012

Application of continuous turbidity sensors to supplement estimates of total phosphorus concentrations in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Accurate estimates of total phosphorus (TP) loadings to eastern Lake Erie are critical for developing load reduction targets and for determining if commitments are being met under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, 2012 (GLWQA). Currently, loading calculations from Canadian priority tributaries are supported by year-round event-focused water quality sampling using automated samplers and laboratory water quality measurements. Here we evaluate the suitability of continuously-measured parameters, namely turbidity and flow, to supplement or enhance knowledge about TP concentrations in the Grand River, ON, by providing continuous data alongside event-focused sample measurements. A series of simple and multiple linear regression models were evaluated and compared with respect to their ability to predict TP water concentrations as a function of different combinations of explanatory variables. Explanatory variables included turbidity, flow, season and flow condition (i.e. hysteresis). The models that performed best explained 63-65% of the variation of TP which is comparable to surrogate model applications in the U.S and elsewhere. Additional model calibration work is needed due to gaps in turbidity data particularly during high flow events. We emphasize the need for continued automated, event focused water quality sampling. However, provided that operational challenges are overcome, our results indicate that sensor-derived water quality parameters to predict TP concentrations is a promising technique that may supplement and improve nutrient loading estimates in the Grand River into the future and provides guidance for the utilization of this method in other tributaries.

During the past nearly 50 years, remarkable morphodynamic evolution occurred in the Jianli reach of the Middle Yangtze River owing to the combined effects of an artificial cutoff, the upstream operation of the Three Gorges Project (TGP), and the downstream confluence of the Dongting Lake. To better understand the characteristics of morphodynamic changes in the whole study reach, variations in thalweg shifting and bankfull channel geometry were quantified using a reach-averaged approach, and the effects of upstream and downstream controls were investigated on channel geometry adjustments. Calculated results indicate that: (i) events of an artificial cutoff and high flows caused the average rate of reach-scale thalweg migration to be greater than 35 m/yr, but there was a 22% reduction in the mean migration rate after the TGP operation; (ii) channel geometry adjusted mostly in the aspect of bankfull depth under various river regulation engineering, with the reach-scale bankfull depth increasing by 0.95 m from 2002 to 2016; (iii) the reach-scale bankfull dimensions are closely associated with these accumulated effects of both the altered flow-sediment regime because of upstream dam construction, and the local base-level variation owing to the downstream confluence of the Dongting Lake. Furthermore, these bankfull variables were expressed by power functions of two key parameters, covering the previous five-year average fluvial erosion intensity during flood seasons at Jianli (upstream control), and the corresponding water level difference between Jianli and Lianhuatang (downstream control). The proposed relations were calibrated by the observed data in 2002-2014, and were further verified by measurements in 2015-2016. The proposed methodology can also be applicable to estimate channel geometry adjustments of other similar alluvial rivers controlled by both upstream and downstream boundary conditions.

In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in water-surface temperature (WST) and surface heat fluxes for the period between January 2001 and December 2010 in Lake Mirim, a large (surface area ca. 4000 km(2)) shallow lake on the Brazil-Uruguay border. The aquatic ecosystem was examined using in-situ WST measurements, MODIS land surface temperature (M*D11A1 LST) products, and a coupling between a large-scale hydrologic model (MGB-IPH) and a hydrodynamic/water quality model (IPH-ECO). The WST values estimated by the hydrodynamic model were consistent with measured in-situ data and MODIS-derived WST, using both daytime and nighttime time series (R-2 = 0.88; Bias = 1.45 degrees C; RMSE = 2.16 degrees C; ENS = 0.77). Our findings also revealed that the dominant heat fluxes in the lake are the atmospheric longwave radiation (annual mean = 303.38 W m(-2)), water longwave radiation (annual mean = 336.01 W m(-2)), and the latent heat flux (annual mean = 51.14 W m(-2)). Additionally, the heat flux from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget in the lake, being the Cebollati river the main contributor (annual average = 4.63 W m(-2)). Coupled large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic models will benefit future modeling efforts by providing an effective management tool to study the effect of case scenarios (e.g., climate change) on temperature dynamics, heat fluxes, and physical and ecological processes in these ecosystems.					; Júnior, Carlos/I-8538-2019	da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053; Bravo, Juan Martin/0000-0001-5585-1257; Munar, Andres Mauricio/0000-0003-2056-7234; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	2019	575						244	256		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.025													WOS:000488143000020

In the time domain, the stable oxygen isotopic ratio of the lake water (delta O-18(L)) exhibited substantial seasonal and interannual variations, but the isotope variations between different precipitation events substantially exceeded seasonal and interannual variations. Compared with the stable isotopes in precipitation, delta O-18(L) was substantially positive and d(L) was negative. In the space domains, the lake water was homogeneously mixed. Indicated by statistic analyses, precipitation plays a dominant role in dynamic of the lake stable isotope during precipitation events of relatively large magnitude, whereas the effect of evaporation is dominant during smaller precipitation events. Results advance our understanding of the stable isotope change rule in the process of lake water evaporation, and it is helpful to identify the climatic significance recorded in stable isotopic compositions of lake bottom sediments.

Cholera outbreaks have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the 1970s. They have been ravaging the shore of Lake Kivu in the east of the country repeatedly during the last decades. Here we employ a spatially explicit, inhomogeneous Markov chain model to describe cholera incidence in eight health zones on the shore of the lake. Remotely sensed data sets of chlorophyll a concentration in the lake, precipitation and indices of global climate anomalies are used as environmental drivers in addition to baseline seasonality. The effect of human mobility is also modelled mechanistically. We test several models on a multiyear data set of reported cholera cases. The best fourteen models, accounting for different environmental drivers, and selected using the Akaike information criterion, are formally compared via proper cross validation. Among these, the one accounting for seasonality, El Nino Southern Oscillation, precipitation and human mobility outperforms the others in cross validation. Some drivers (such as human mobility and rainfall) are retained only by a few models, possibly indicating that the mechanisms through which they influence cholera dynamics in the area will have to be investigated further.

J	Montañez, IP; Cecil, CB				Montanez, Isabel P.; Cecil, C. Blaine			Paleoenvironmental clues archived in non-marine Pennsylvanian-lower Permian limestones of the Central Appalachian Basin, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												Nonmarine limestones are a key component of the upper Middle Pennsylvanian through lower Permian succession in the Appalachian Basin. Previous interpretations of their environments of deposition range from brackish coastal mudflats to hydrologically open freshwater lake complexes with peat-forming vegetated marshes to semi-closed or closed, possibly saline, shallow lakes developed on a distal alluvial plain. Ostracode wackestones/packstones, some exhibiting laminations, and with fish debris, articulated ostracode shells and phosphatic clasts define the lower portions of limestone beds or benches, passing upward into ostracode-peloidal wackestones/packstones and intraclastic-skeletal-peloidal pacicstones/grainstones. Desiccation features and rooting structures, which are developed in the upper portions of the limestones, record subaerial exposure, pedogenic alteration and desiccation. Pseudomicrokarst and caliche-like vadose and early diagenetic phreatic cements suggest a seasonally dry subhumid to semi-arid regional climate. Many of the sedimentologic and diagenetic features of the limestones are characteristic of palustrine carbonates, which coupled with their stratigraphic relation to paleo-Vertisols, siliciclastics, and coals, indicate that they formed in broad seasonal wetland-pond complexes that developed on distal regions of a low-gradient, distal alluvial plain under seasonally dry subhumid to semi-arid climates. Integration of Sr isotopic compositions of shark teeth with previously published stable isotope compositions of the limestones suggests that these purely continental environments were hydrologically semi-closed to closed systems. Repeated stacking of these features at the bed- to limestone bench-scale defines repeated shallowing upward, drying cycles at the 10(3) to 10(4) yr-scale, which were likely climate-driven.

Principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA), correlation analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were utilised to determine the accumulation profiles of each element over four seasons. The greatest element accumulation was found to occur in the gills. All elements in exoskeletal tissue displayed positive correlations with each other, a similar trend was also observed in the hepatopancreas samples. Strong (r=0.868) and very strong (r=0.960) positive correlations were found between the accumulations of Al and Fe in gills and the exoskeleton, respectively. Correlations in tissue accumulation rates are discussed in the context of metabolic roles and impacts associated with the elements tested. Elemental compositions of Yenicaa water and sediment samples were also investigated to determine whether the composition of the surrounding environment matches the metal accumulation trends of tissue samples. We demonstrate that, by the criteria set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Lake Yenicaa is heavily polluted in terms of As and Ni.

J	Saunders, DL; Kalff, J				Saunders, DL; Kalff, J			Nitrogen retention in wetlands, lakes and rivers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												As human activities continue to alter the global nitrogen cycle, the ability to predict the impact of increased nitrogen loading to freshwater systems is becoming more and more important. Nitrogen retention is of particular interest because it is through its combined processes (denitrification, nitrogen sedimentation and uptake by aquatic plants) that local and downstream nitrogen concentrations are reduced. Here, we compare the magnitude of nitrogen retention and its components in wetlands, lakes and rivers. We show that wetlands retain the highest proportion of total nitrogen loading, followed by lakes and then rivers. The differences in the proportion of N retained among systems is explained almost entirely by differences in water discharge. Denitrification is the primary mechanism of nitrogen retention, followed by nitrogen sedimentation and uptake by aquatic plants.																			0018-8158					JAN	2001	443	1-3					205	212		10.1023/A:1017506914063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017506914063													WOS:000168065900018

Climate change has the potential to modify habitat characteristics and, consequently, induce species responses to ongoing environmental changes. Functional traits determine both if a species can persist and maintain stable population sizes in particular ecological conditions, and its capacity to disperse to more favourable habitats. 2. Given that functional traits evolve over time, one could expect closely related species to show similar responses to climate change, which should identify vulnerable lineages. Alternatively, species-specific functional traits may anticipate species responses to climate change, and therefore, trait composition should be a strong predictor. 3. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of functional traits of 84 Iberian and Moroccan odonates species and built a phylogenetic tree to determine if dissimilarity of traits and phylogenetic relatedness are relevant to better discriminate species range-shift responses to climate change. 4. Modelling results for 66 species showed clear impacts of the increase in temperature and drought events on their potential distribution. The traits that best-discriminated species that expanded their ranges were multivoltinism, short-life cycles and preference for temporary habitats, whereas species with a reduced and displaced potential distribution were mostly semivoltine, with a short flying season, oviposition on gravel and restricted to permanent streams, small rivers or oligotrophic lakes. Trait conservatism was rejected and phylogenetic relatedness was a poor predictor of range shifts. 5. Considering odonates as model organisms, traits such as voltinism, beginning and prolongation of flight period and preference of temporal habitats should be examined to anticipate range-shift responses of freshwater insects to climate change.

J	Xiang, J; Chen, HG; Ishikawa, H				Xiang, Jian; Chen, Honggen; Ishikawa, Hirofumi			A mathematical model for the transmission of Schistosoma japonicum in consideration of seasonal water level fluctuations of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi, China	PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL												Background: Poyang Lake, the largest fresh water lake in China, is the major transmission site of Schistosoma japonicum in China. Epidemics of schistosomiasis japonica have threatened the health of residents and stunted social-economic development there. Objective: This article aims at evaluating the effect of various control measures against schistosomiasis: selective mass treatment (ST), targeted mass treatment (TO, mass treatment for animal reservoirs (MT), and health education (HE), on reduction of the prevalence through simulations based on a mathematical model. Methods: We proposed a mathematical model, which is a system of ordinary differential equations for the transmission of S. japonicum among humans, bovines, and snails. The model takes into account the seasonal variation of the water level of Poyang Lake that is caused by the backflow of the Yangtze River and inflow from five small rivers, which influences the transmission of S. japonicum. For the purpose of dealing with the age-specific prevalence and intensity of infection, the human population was classified into four age categories in the model. We carried out several simulations resulting from the execution of ST and for elementary school children (E Sch), and combinations of ST, MT, and HE. Results: The simulations indicated that all of the control measures only for humans had a trend of revival after interruption, and a combination of ST and MT has a significant effect on reducing human infection. Although and HE had a significant effect on the prevalence in the E Sch group, it had little effect on the overall human population. Conclusion: The simulations indicate that measures targeted to bovines such as chemotherapy besides humans will be vital to eliminate the transmission of S. japonicum in the Poyang Lake region. Moreover, it is desirable to improve health education for fishermen and herdsmen. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Fonseca, BM; Bicudo, CED				Fonseca, Barbara M.; Bicudo, Carlos E. de M.			Phytoplankton seasonal variation in a shallow stratified eutrophic reservoir (Garcas Pond, Brazil)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study aimed at describing the phytoplankton dynamics and structure in a shallow eutrophic reservoir, the Garcas Pond, located in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (23 degrees 38'40.6 '' S, 46 degrees 37'28.0 '' W), in the Municipality of Sauo Paulo, southeast Brazil. Samples were collected monthly from January to December 1997 in five depths (subsurface, 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, and 20 cm above the bottom) in the pelagic zone (Z(max) = 4.7 m). Abiotic variables studied were: water temperature, turbidity, transparency, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, inorganic carbon, and N and P dissolved and total forms. Altogether 236 phytoplankton taxa distributed among 10 classes were identified. Phytoplankton seasonal and vertical variation was related to shifts in the water chemical features as a consequence of a warm-wet season with stratified water column (phase 1, January-March and September-December) alternating with a cool-dry season with mixed water column (phase 2, April-August). There were shifts in cyanobacterial dominance over the entire year. During phase 1, Raphidiopsis/Cylindrospermopsis was one of the most important taxon. During phase 2, Raphidiopsis/Cylindrospermopsis biomass decreased, whereas richness and diversity increased and diatoms were relatively abundant. In September, when the water column was markedly stratified, a cyanobacterial bloom (Sphaerocavum brasiliense) occurred. Changes in water chemical variables caused by the bloom allowed recognition of a phase 3, in which pH and chlorophyll a, TP and CO32- concentration reached their highest values. According to Reynolds and collaborators' functional groups approach, phase 1 was marked by groups S/W1/W2/H1/Y, phase 2 by groups K/L-M/L-O/D/P/X1/F, and phase 3 by group M. This sequence was corroborated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) results.					; Fonseca, Barbara/AAD-9760-2019; Bicudo, Carlos/D-2302-2015	Fonseca, Barbara/0000-0002-7898-771X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2008	600						267	282		10.1007/s10750-007-9240-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9240-9													WOS:000253765200024

Transgenerational effects may be important in modulating adaptation of future generations and buffering negative impacts of temperature changes. The potential for these effects may be important in freshwater fish species, as temperature is a key abiotic component of their environment. Yet, still, relatively few studies have assessed the presence and importance of transgenerational effects under natural conditions. The purpose of this study was to test how parental thermal conditions influenced offspring growth and survival following stocking in Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis). To do so, part of the breeders were exposed to a "cold" treatment while others were exposed to a "warm" treatment during the final steps of gonad maturation (constant 2? difference between treatments along the seasonal temperature decrease). The impact on offspring of a selection treatment targeting production traits of interest (absence of sexual maturation at 1+, combined with increased growth) in breeders was also evaluated. After 7-8 months of growth in captivity, offspring were stocked in natural lakes. Their growth and survival were assessed about a year later. Offspring from "cold" breeders showed lower survival than those from "warm" breeders and the selection treatment had no effect on survival. However, the selection treatment was linked to lower Fulton's condition index, which, in turn, was positively correlated to survival in lakes. This study highlights the importance of working in ecological/industrial context to fully assess the different impacts of transgenerational effects on traits and survival. Our results also have important implications for stocking practices used to support the sport fishing industry.

The present study aimed to explore the relationship between riverine runoff and phytoplankton community structure in Koka Reservoir, Ethiopia. Onsite measurements and collection of water samples and phytoplankton were performed at monthly intervals from January to August 2016 at three sampling sites along a stretch of the reservoir running from the river mouth to center and the outlet (dam). The results showed the decline in phytoplankton biomass at the river mouth site. The decline was particularly noticeable during the period of high rainfall and runoff compared to that of the low water period. This was associated with the hydrodynamics-induced high turbidity and reduced euphotic depth. Our results implied that phytoplankton community structure was strongly influenced by flood pulse. The results suggest that river flow and watershed management have the potential to be used more widely as an aquatic resources management option in small and medium-sized lakes and reservoirs.

Aiming to provide new observations about optical properties of water in two distinct reservoirs situated along the cascade system of Tiete River: Barra Bonita (BB) and Nova Avanhandava (Nav), this study described and discussed their inherent optical properties (IOPs) in terms of the absorption contribution. BB showed a dominance in the phytoplankton fraction at all visible wavelengths, and Nav by nonalgal particle absorption (a(NAP)), mainly at the blue and green wavelengths. The mass-specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 nm observed in Nav and BB corroborated with the assumption that the trophic state decreases from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic. The a(NAP) (lambda) did not show a seasonal pattern between field campaigns and reservoirs. The absorption coefficient of particulate enhanced the strong influence of phytoplankton pigments along the visible spectrum in BB, whereas Nav only displayed the peak at 675 nm represented by chlorophyll a absorption and high contribution of non-algal particle and colored dissolved organic matter in the blue region. These findings recommend the use of different modelling approaches to estimate water quality parameters from both sites when the inputs of the models consider the specific information about the IOPs and their relation with the in-water constituents.

Biometric parameters, percent meat and intervalval fluid contents, Condition Index, proximate composition and lipid profile of mussels were studied. The low meat content and Condition Index values registered in December, in mussels from the Adriatic site (142.0 +/- 9.9), and in September, in mussels from the Tyrrhenian sea lake (126.0 +/- 2.3) were coincident with the depletion of glycogen and lipid reserves. Gas chromatographic analysis of total lipids showed the prevalence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (37-48% of total fatty acids) over the saturated (26-38%) and monounsaturated (16-29%) ones throughout the year. Seasonal fluctuations of vitamin A, vitamin E, cholesterol, phytosterols and carotenes levels, in mussels from either site, were detected by high performance liquid chromatography.

Hydrologic Controls on Individual Ostracode Stable Isotopes in a Desert Lake: A Modern Baseline for Lake Turkana	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Stable carbon (d(13)C) and oxygen (d(18)O) isotope measurements in lacustrine ostracodes are widely used as paleolimnological indicators of past climate change. Previous work has used individual ostracode valves to resolve seasonal and subdecadal paleohydrological signals, yet replicated assessments of co-occurring specimens from modern samples are rare. Here we focus on ostracodes from sediments collected in 1979 from Lake Turkana, an alkaline desert lake in tropical eastern Africa. Sourced from the Ethiopian highlands, the Omo River is the dominant inflow into this lake. We present individual ostracode valve analyses (IOVA) of delta C-13 and delta O-18 measurements (n = 329) of the extant benthic ostracode Sclerocypris clavularis from 17 sites spanning the entire lake (n(avg) = similar to 19 specimens/site). We demonstrate that the pooled statistics of individual valve measurements at each site are shaped by lake hydrology, superimposed over inter-individual isotopic variations. Within-site variance in IOVA-delta C-13 is larger (similar to 60%) than that of IOVA-delta O-18. Yet, site-based averages exhibit a systematic pattern, with higher d values toward the southern part of the lake, away from Omo River inflow. We suggest that the latitudinal delta C-13 gradient may arise from low riverine delta C-13 and low organic matter delta C-13 as a productivity response to nutrient-rich Omo River inflow toward the north. The delta O-18 pattern may be explained by the diminishing influence of Omo River inflows and more evaporation driving higher IOVA-delta O-18 values toward the windier, southern basin. We conclude that pooled IOVA statistics in Omo-Turkana sediments can aid interpretations of past regional paleohydrology and its variability in this basin. Plain Language Summary Ostracodes are microscopic, aquatic crustaceans that deposit shells ("valves") made of calcium carbonate. Retrieved from sediment cores, these valves are widely used to estimate past water conditions using their shell chemistry. Here we focus on stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in numerous individual valves in modern sediments taken from multiple sites across Lake Turkana, Kenya. This lake is located in a hot and arid region in tropical eastern Africa. The Omo River, which is sourced from rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands region, is the major river that flows into Lake Turkana. We find that ostracode stable isotopes are useful recorders of lake hydrology in this basin and reveal a strong fingerprint of Omo River inflow as well as evaporation toward the windier southern part of Lake Turkana. Analyzing numerous individual valves at each site can help produce better estimates of average changes in past lakewater conditions versus changes arising from seasonal variations. Our results provide a modern baseline of ostracode stable isotopes at Lake Turkana. We suggest that both the average of, and variations within individual-valve measurements of ostracode geochemistry can help characterize past hydrological variability and lake water conditions.

Hence, sustainable management of water reservoirs, along with constant monitoring of water quality and quantity through effective and low-cost technologies, such as remote sensing, is vital to avoid hydrological stress and prevent water crises. However, monitoring longterm time series of reservoir parameters can be limited by data availability and the computing power of the available machinery. Therefore, the present study proposes a method that combines the use of a digital elevation model (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission [SRTM]) and Landsat images with the Google Earth Engine cloud processing platform to monitor multiple reservoir metrics (surface area, water level, and useful storage). The method was applied to study these metrics between 2009 and 2020 for the Corumba IV water dam, Goias, Brazil, where 24 mosaic images, one for each 6-month period, were obtained by filtering cloudy pixels and selecting pixels of better quality. Composite RGB images of short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and red (SWIR1/NIR/R) bands were transformed to HSV to classify the water pixels and estimate the surface area of the reservoir. Area estimates were then 1) used to assess water level and useful storage through linear fitting (regression method [RM]); and 2) combined with SRTM elevation to obtain water level and useful storage (elevation method [EM]). Metrics of rainy and dry seasons that were calculated using linear RM of surface area estimates produced good results, with a coefficient of determination of 0.74 and 0.78 for determining water level and useful storage, respectively. However, the use of SRTM elevation information (EM) provided an even more efficient estimation method, with coefficients of determination of 0.84 and 0.95 for water level and useful storage estimates, respectively.

One hundred submerged woody substrates were collected from this lake every three months and examined for fungi to investigate seasonal variation. A total of 97 fungi were recorded, including 56 ascomycetes and 41 anamorphic fungi. The occurrence of these fungi was recorded and the Shannon-Weiner index (H) was used to evaluate the fungal diversity. The results showed that the variation among the four seasonal collections were insignificant. The diversity indices (H) at the four season collections varied from 3.155 to 3.681. The fungal community on woody substrates from Lake Dianchi is compared with that from Lake Fuxian during the same season and differences were apparent (similarity index=0.337). The diversity was higher in Lake Fuxian (H'=3.808) than in Lake Dianchi (H'=3.368) and this may be related to riparian vegetation and pollution. The effects of pollution on freshwater fungal communities are discussed. One hundred submerged samples each of three monocotyledon species (Phragmites australis, Pennisetum purpurreum and a bamboo species) were collected from Lake Dianchi and examined for fungi. The communities on each grass species are compared and discussed in relation to host-specificity.

J	Langhans, SD; Schallenberg, M				Langhans, Simone Daniela; Schallenberg, Marc			Accounting for diverse cultural values in freshwater management plans by using a transparent and collaborative decision support system based on multi-criteria decision analysis	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The inadequate success of decades-long attempts to restore aquatic biodiversity casts doubt on the effectiveness of common top-down driven approaches that focus on ecological and socio-economic objectives alone. A way forward is engaging with the public with the aim of accounting for cultural values and local knowledge and building community buy-in to restoration and management plans. We demonstrate a values-based framework based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to develop a management plan for the Lake Wanaka catchment, making use of the fact that Aotearoa/New Zealand mandates action plans to consider community values. The MCDA-framework successfully wove together cultural, ecological, and socio-economic values. Clearly translating values into objectives and structuring them hierarchically allowed the identification of current system deficits and management scenarios to address them. Combining the estimated effects of potential actions with the process participants' subjective preferences for high-level objectives led to a clear prioritisation of management scenarios. The elicited preferences highlighted the community's collective perspective on the relative importance of local objectives, which is an optimal basis upon which to agree on a management plan. We recommend values-based approaches such as MCDA as a way forward for inclusive freshwater co-management not only in Aotearoa/New Zealand, but elsewhere as well.

The calibrated model simulated seasonal dynamics of phosphorus concentrations in major components of the lake's ecological network before and after 1997, the year when an invasive allochthonous crustacean, the Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), was introduced into the lake. The shift from clean to turbid phase, due to grazing by crayfish on submerged vegetation, caused a gradual decrease in eco-exergy, reflecting an increase in entropy, related to breakdown of ecosystem internal equilibria. This case study verifies the hypothesis of Marchi et al. (2010) that, after an initial relatively stable state, the allochthonous species may cause an increase in entropy indicating perturbation of the ecosystem. Published by Elsevier B.V.

MC-LR, MC-LR-GSH, and MC-LR-Cys were determined by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrum (LC-ESI-MS). The mean MC-LR concentrations in the hepatopancreas of snail and shrimp and liver of silver carp were 6.61, 0.24, and 0.027 mu g g(-1) dry weight (DW), respectively: while the average MC-LR-Cys concentrations were 0.50, 0.97, and 5.72 mu g g(-1) DW, respectively. MC-LR-GSH was usually not detectable in these samples. The above results suggest that: (1) in aquatic animals, especially fish, the main excretion form of MC-LR could be MC-LR-Cys, but not MC-LR-GSH, whereas MC-LR-Cys might play an important role in detoxication of MC-LR and (2) that efficiency of MC-LR-Cys formation differs among species. The main detoxication pathway of MC-LR in aquatic animals is suggested as follows: when MC-LR enters into liver/hepatopancreas, it firstly conjugates with polypeptide or protein (including GSH, PP-1 and 2A) containing Cys residues, perhaps also some free cysteine; subsequently, MC-LR-Cys is degraded from these polypeptide or protein; and finally is excreted from animals by the compound of MC-LR-Cys.

J	Vincens, A; Garcin, Y; Buchet, G				Vincens, Annie; Garcin, Yannick; Buchet, Guillaume			Influence of rainfall seasonality on African lowland vegetation during the Late Quaternary: pollen evidence from Lake Masoko, Tanzania	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim To determine if changes in the key bioclimatic parameters associated with rainfall seasonality can be quantified from fossil sequences and to distinguish them from changes in the total annual rainfall. Location Lake Masoko, southern Tanzania (9 degrees 20' S, 33 degrees 45' E, 840 m a.s.l.). Methods Fossil pollen was extracted from a long and well-dated sedimentary sequence spanning the period 45,000-4400 cal. yr BP. The modern habitat, geographical distribution and climatic range (mean annual rainfall and temperature, and length of the dry season) of selected East African plants were used to infer past rainfall attributes for the most characteristic fossil pollen taxa identified from the sediments of Lake Masoko. Results In the Masoko pollen sequence it has been possible to identify changes in the length/severity of the dry season during the last 45,000 cal. yr BP, which are interpreted to reflect shifts in the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the southern tropics. We suggest that this bioclimatic parameter has been the main driver of the vegetation dynamics in this area. The major inferred change occurred at the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition c. 11,800 cal. yr BP, when semi-deciduous forest disappeared, being replaced in the lake catchment by woodland, which persists to the present day in spite of locally high rainfall. Main conclusions In tropical regions under the influence of the ITCZ, the position and strength of which determine the distribution of rainfall through the year, more attention must be paid to the impact of the length and intensity of the dry season on the modern and past distribution and dynamics of the vegetation. This climatic parameter is as important as the total annual amount of rainfall, and probably one of the most relevant in lowland areas.

A regression model was constructed to describe the relationship between lake area or lake shoreline length and total macrophyte or total emergent macrophyte coverage. Phragmites australis and Equisetum fluviatile were by far the most widely distributed emergent macrophytes in the area with a proportion of 40% of all zone-forming macrophytes. The zone-forming floating-leaved species Nuphar lutea, Potamogeton natans and Sparganium spp. covered 44% of all vegetated littoral areas. The strong temperature dependence of the emission rates was taken into consideration in the emission estimations for P. australis and E. fluviatile. The regional efflux, estimated for the growing seasons 1998-2002, varied between 0.8 X 10(5) and 1.1 X 10(5) kg CH4 and between 1.6 x 10(5) and 2.4 x 10(5) kg CH4, respectively. The emissions from the stands of floating-leaved species were negligible compared to the emissions from stands of P. australis and E. fluviatile. This indicates that species specific emission rates and areal coverage of the dominating species, as well as ambient temperature, should all be carefully considered when estimating the total regional emissions of CH4 from lake littorals. The natural open ombrogenous bogs and minerogenous fens in the study region covered a 2.5-fold larger area than P. australis and E fluviatile littoral, but their emissions were estimated to be only 78% of the emissions of P. australis and E. fluviatile, indicating that vegetated lake littoral is an important natural CH4 source in the region.

J	Jahren, AH				Jahren, A. Hope			The Arctic Forest of the Middle Eocene	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES	Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences											Lush forests, dominated by deciduous conifers, existed well north of the Arctic Circle during the middle Eocene (similar to 45 Ma). The Fossil Forest site, located on Axel Heiberg Island, Canada, has yielded a particularly rich assemblage of plant macro- and microfossils, as well as palcosols-all exquisitely preserved. Methods ranging from classical paleobotany, to stable-isotope geochemistry, have been applied to materials excavated from the Fossil Forest and have revealed layers of diverse conifer forests with a rich angiosperm understory that successfully endured three months of continuous light and three months of continuous darkness. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions suggest a warm, ice-free environment, with high growing-season-relative humidity, and high rates of soil methanogenesis. Methods to evaluate intraseasonal variability highlight the switchover from stored to actively fixed carbon during the short annual growing season.						Jahren, A.

The heterotrophic Bacteria Associated with Cyanobacterial Aggregates (BACA) are known to provide adaptative support to cyanobacterial species which outcompete the microorganisms during the period of bloom formation. In this study, diversity, seasonal succession, spatial, and host specificity of BACA were explored by analyzing their diversity in time-series samples from a eutrophic freshwater lake, Lake Taihu. Diversity analysis using high-throughput sequencing of the samples investigated here revealed that four Microcystis species including Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis wesenbergii, Microcystis panniformis, and Microcystis flos-aquae tend to exhibit host specificity. However, no obvious differences between the BACA of floating and sinking samples were observed in this study. Water temperature was found as a key factor driving the succession of BACA in Taihu Lake. BACA was not only observed, exhibiting long term seasonal succession but intra-seasonal succession in response to steep environmental changes was also observed. This study provides detailed insights into the diversity, seasonal succession, spatial and host specificity of BACA in Lake Taihu. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigating the differences in evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning and crop coefficients (K-c) between DSR and TPR is essential in understanding how agricultural water demand is affected by crop rotation. In this study, the water fluxes of two-year (2017-2018) growing seasons were collected from a pair of eddy covariance (EC) towers for DSR and TPR in the Poyang Lake Basin, Southern China. This study aims to compare the seasonal characteristics of the ET components (evaporation, E, and transpiration, T) and dual crop coefficients (basal crop coefficient, K-s center dot K-cb, and soil/water crop coefficient, K-e) of DSR with those of TPR. The ET values for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons were 374 mm and 436 mm for the DSR, respectively, and 309 mm and 342 mm for the TPR. The seasonal T/ET values in 2017 and 2018 were 0.40 and 0.46 for the DSR, respectively, and 0.49 and 0.52 for the TPR, indicating that the higher ET values for the DSR can be mostly attributed to E. The DSR had overall higher K-c values than the TPR because of free water evaporation during the initial stage and a higher plant density. Our results enrich the K-c dataset for DSR and have great implications for the sustainable irrigation of the Poyang Lake Basin in the future.					; Shi, Lijie/KDM-9399-2024	Liu, Bo/0009-0004-0993-7657; 														2073-4395				APR 25	2023	13	5							1218	10.3390/agronomy13051218	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051218													WOS:000995477400001

The palaeoenvironment of the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Turonian) portion of the Winton Formation, Queensland, Australia	PEERJ												The Winton Formation is increasingly recognised as an important source of information about the Cretaceous of Australia, and, more broadly, the palaeobiogeographic history of eastern Gondwana. With more precise dating and stratigraphic controls starting to provide temporal context to the geological and palaeontological understanding of this formation, it is timely to reassess the palaeoenvironment in which it was deposited. This new understanding helps to further differentiate the upper, most-studied portion of the formation (Cenomanian-Turonian) from the lower portions (Albian-Cenomanian), allowing a coherent picture of the ecosystem to emerge. Temperatures during the deposition of the Upper Cretaceous portion of the Winton Formation were warm, with high, seasonal rainfall, but not as extreme as the modern monsoon. The landscape was heterogeneous, a freshwater alluvial plain bestrode by low energy, meandering rivers, minor lakes and mires. Infrequent, scouring flood events were part of a multi-year cycle of drier and wetter years. The heavily vegetated flood plains supported abundant large herbivores. This was the final infilling of the great Eromanga Basin.					; Fletcher, Tamara/I-3107-2019; Moss, Patrick/AFM-9408-2022; Salisbury, Steven/A-7518-2011	Moss, Patrick/0000-0003-1546-9242; Fletcher, Tamara/0000-0001-9066-7834; 													2167-8359					SEP 7	2018	6								e5513	10.7717/peerj.5513	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5513								30210941					WOS:000444048900004

FEMALE SITE FAMILIARITY INCREASES FLEDGING SUCCESS IN PIPING PLOVERS (CHARADRIUS MELODUS)	AUK												Reproductive success commonly improves with age in birds. However, it is difficult to determine whether this phenomenon is due to breeding experience or other age-related factors because most potential explanatory factors are positively correlated. Using a 17-year database, we investigated how age, breeding experience, location experience, and pair-bond experience influenced Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) reproductive success in the Great Lakes region. Reproductive success was measured as number of offspring fledged per pair for 415 successful nests during 1993-2009. We controlled for individual and site variation with random effects and tested for increased reproductive success associated with age, prior breeding experience, prior location experience, and prior pair-bond experience using generalized linear mixed models. Reproductive success increased with location-specific breeding experience of females and declined when females moved to a new location. After statistically controlling for these effects, we found no additional effect of male age, male experience, or pair experience. Additionally, fledging success declined with later hatching dates, so we examined the relative influence of age and experience on hatch date and determined that older females and males bred earlier. Our results indicate that improvement in reproductive success with age in Piping Plovers has two components: a direct effect of female location experience on fledging success, and an indirect effect of timing of breeding, which leads to greater reproductive success through earlier nesting by older males and females. Actions by resource managers to promote breeding philopatry and successful early nesting attempts may enhance reproductive success of this federally endangered population.

Such washes, interspersed with vast dunes, are typical of Titan's tropical landscape. Yet, Cassini-Huygens measurements reveal a highly stable tropical atmosphere devoid of deep convective storms, and the formation of washes in dune fields is not understood. Here we examine the effects of seasonal variations in humidity, surface heating, and dynamical forcing on the stability of Titan's troposphere. We find that during the probe landing, the middle troposphere was weakly unstable to convection, consistent with the tenuous cloud detected at 21 km. Yet the tropical atmosphere, at any season, is too stable to produce deep convective storms. Convection in the tropics remains weak and confined to altitudes below similar to 30 km, unless the humidity is increased below 9 km altitude. Solar heating is insufficient to significantly humidify the tropical atmosphere. The large polar lakes are seasonably stable, and the methane column abundance measured by Huygens typical of the tropical atmosphere. Our study indicates the presence of distinct polar and equatorial climates. It also suggests that fluvial features in the tropics do not result from recent seasonal rainstorms, and thereby supports other origins such as geological seepage, cryovolcanism, or a wetter climate in the past.

J	Birks, HJB				Birks, HJB			D.G.!Frey & E.S.!Deevey review #1 - Numerical tools in palaeolimnology - Progress, potentialities, and problems	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												In the last decade, palaeolimnology has shifted emphasis from being a predominantly qualitative, descriptive subject to being a quantitative, analytical science with the potential to address critical hypotheses concerning the impacts of environmental changes on limnic systems. This change has occurred because of (1) major developments in applied statistics, some of which have only become possible because of the extraordinary developments in computer technology, (2) increased concern about problem definition, research hypotheses, and project design, (3) the building up of high quality modem calibration data-sets, and (4) the narrowing of temporal resolution in palaeolimnological studies from centuries to decades or even single years or individual seasons. The most significant development in quantitative palaeolimnology has been the creation of many modern calibration data-sets of biotic assemblages and associated environmental data. Such calibration sets, when analysed by appropriate numerical procedures, have the potential to transform fossil biostratigraphical data into quantitative estimates of the past environment. The relevant numerical techniques are now well developed, widely tested, and perform remarkably well. The properties of these techniques are becoming better known as a result of simulation studies. The advantages and disadvantages of the preferred technique (weighted averaging partial least squares) are reviewed and the problems in model selection are discussed. The need for evaluation and validation of reconstructions is emphasised. Several statistical surprises have emerged from calibration studies. Outstanding problems remain the need for a detailed and consistent taxonomy in the calibration sets, the quality, representativeness, and inherent variability of the environmental variables of interest, and the inherent bias in the calibration models. Besides biological-environmental calibration sets, there is the potential to develop modern sediment-environment calibration sets to link sedimentary properties to catchment parameters. The adoption of a 'dynamic calibration set' approach may help to minimise the inherent bias in current calibration models. Modern regression techniques are available to explore the vast amount of unique ecological information about taxon-environment relationships in calibration data-sets. Hypothesis testing in palaeolimnology can be attempted directly by careful project design to take account of 'natural experiments' or indirectly by means of statistical testing, often involving computer-intensive permutation tests to evaluate specific null hypotheses. The validity of such tests depends on the type of permutation used in relation to the particular data-set being analysed, the sampling design, and the research questions being asked. Stratigraphical data require specific permutation tests. Several problems remain unsolved in devising permutation designs for fine-resolution stratigraphical data and for combined spatial and temporal data. Constrained linear or non-linear reduced rank regression techniques (e.g. redundancy analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and their partial counterparts) provide powerful tools for testing hypotheses in palaeolimnology. Work is needed, however, to extend their use to investigate and test for lag responses between biological assemblages and their environment. Having developed modern calibration data-sets, many palaeolimnologists are returning to the sedimentary record and are studying stratigraphical changes. In contrast to much palynological data, palaeolimnological data are often fine-resolution and as a result are often noisy, large, and diverse. Recent developments for detecting and summarising patterns in such data are reviewed, including statistical evaluation of zones, summarisation by detrended correspondence analysis, and non-parametric regression (e.g. LOESS). Techniques of time-series analysis that are free of many of the assumptions of conventional time-series analysis due to the development of permutation tests to assess statistical significance are of considerable potential in analysing fine-resolution palaeolimnological data. Such data also contain a wealth of palaeopopulation information. Robust statistical techniques are needed to help identify non-linear deterministic dynamics (chaos) from noise or random effects in fine-resolution palaeolimnological data.					Birks, H.

Expansion and settlement of ticks in new localizations depend on the presence of suitable hosts, for both adult and juvenile ticks. Methods: The current study was planned to complement our previous studies on questing adult ticks and was focused on a collection of juvenile D. reticulatus ticks from rodents from three regions in Poland, defined by the presence/absence of adult ticks (regions of the Western and Eastern tick population and the gap area between them) to confirm the existence of stable populations. Rodent trapping was conducted in open habitats (fallow lands, wasteland and submerged meadows) in 2016-2018 in June, July and/or August to encompass seasonal peaks of larvae and nymph activity. Results: Altogether, three tick species were collected, 2866 D. reticulatus, 2141 Ixodes ricinus and 427 Haemaphysalis concinna. Dermacentor reticulatus was the most common (72.3%) and abundant (mean 17.94 +/- 2.62 ticks/rodent) tick species on rodents from the Eastern region; in the Western region infestation of rodents was only 6.8%. Ixodes ricinus was found in all three regions and was the only tick species collected from rodents from the gap area. Haemaphysalis concinna was noted only in the Western region. The highest infestation of juvenile D. reticulatus was recorded on voles (Myodes and Microtus spp.), infestation of I. ricinus was the highest on Apodemus mice, and the majority of H. concinna ticks were collected from root voles Alexandromys oeconomus. Conclusions: Our study confirmed a stable population of D. reticulatus in Eastern and Central Poland and a lower prevalence and mean abundance of this tick species among rodents from the Western region. A lack of juvenile D. reticulatus on rodents in Niewiadow confirmed the existence of the gap area, free of D. reticulatus ticks.					; Dwużnik-Szarek, Dorota/JXY-8581-2024	Dwuznik-Szarek, Dorota/0000-0003-2264-8345; 													1756-3305					OCT 14	2021	14	1							536	10.1186/s13071-021-05039-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05039-z								34649613					WOS:000707362100004
J	Nagy, C; Ng, C; Veverka, N; Weckel, M				Nagy, Christopher; Ng, Chloe; Veverka, Norman; Weckel, Mark			Assessment of a 15-year white-tailed deer management program and woody recovery in a suburban forest preserve	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Overbrowsing by highly abundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) negatively impacts the regeneration of the forest understory throughout the eastern United States. Deer management programs are often used by land managers to reduce deer densities and promote forest regeneration. This study examines the impact of a 15 -yearlong archery-based deer management program on the understory of a nature preserve in southern NY consisting of an old-growth hemlock and second-growth mixed hardwood forest. Vegetation plots were sampled every 3-5 years between 2004 and 2019, while deer density was estimated using camera trap survey data annually since 2009. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to determine the influence of deer density, forest type, canopy cover, and time on species richness, native stem density and total stem density. The most predictive models showed an increase in richness as time went on. Additionally, stem density had a negative relationship with deer density (i.e., stem density and species richness increased as deer density declined over time). For both native and total stem density, the highest-ranked model included only deer density as a predictor. Generally, woody species richness and stem density increased in the seedling ( 0.3 m tall) and sapling (0.3-0.9 m tall) size classes but remained relatively constant for the transgressive ( 0.9 m) size class over time and as deer density decreased. Many native species exhibited density increases in the smallest size classes, but black birch (Betula lenta), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and mapleleaf viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium) were the only native species to increase in the transgressive (>0.9 m tall) class. Several non-native species, however, did increase in the transgressive size class since 2004. These results indicate that the forest has improved as a result of the DMP, but long-term recruitment of native species is still uncertain. The DMP has shown the potential to help restore woody regeneration but monitoring should continue to ultimately determine whether deer management can allow for true recruitment of native seedlings into the forest understory and canopy.						nagy, christopher/0000-0002-2835-2150													0378-1127	1872-7042				JAN 1	2022	503								119748	10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119748		OCT 2021											WOS:000710431600006
J	Wondie, A; Mengistu, S; Vijverberg, J; Dejen, E				Wondie, Ayalew; Mengistu, Seyoum; Vijverberg, Jacobus; Dejen, Eshete			Seasonal variation in primary production of a large high altitude tropical lake (Lake Tana, Ethiopia): effects of nutrient availability and water transparency	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Primary production rates, chlorophyll and phytoplankton biovolume were measured monthly from April 2003 to November 2004 in Lake Tana, a large tropical lake in the highlands of Ethiopia. The lake is characterised by low nutrient concentrations, and a low water transparency due to high silt load of the inflowing rivers during the rainy seasons (May-November) and daily resuspension of sediments in the inshore zone. The mean chlorophyll-a concentrations varied seasonally and ranged from 2.6 mg m(-3) to 8.5 mg m(-3) (mean: 4.5 mg m(-3)) in the offshore zone. Primary production was measured using the light-dark bottles technique. We incubated only at three depths, i.e. 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 m. Therefore, we may have missed a substantial part of the depth production profile and probably also frequently missed P-max. Gross primary production in the openwater averaged 2.43 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and ranged between 0.03 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and 10.2 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1); production was significantly higher in the inshore zone. The highest production rates were observed in the post-rainy season (Oct-Nov), which coincided with a bloom of Microcystis and higher chlorophyll levels. This seasonal high production is probably caused by a relatively high nutrient availability in combination with favourable light conditions. The gross primary production rates of L. Tana are among the lowest compared with other tropical lakes. This will be partly the result of our underestimation of gross primary production by often missing P-max. Another cause is the oligotrophic nature of the lake in combination with its relatively low water transparency. The gross primary production per unit chlorophyll in the openwater zone was in the same range as in 30 other tropical lakes and reservoirs. The higher primary production in the inshore zone is probably the result of the daily water column mixing (Z(mix) >= Z(t)) in this area, enhancing nutrient recycling. A large proportion of the annual primary production is realised in one of the four seasons only. This productive post-rainy season is relatively short (2 months) and therefore efficiency of transfer of matter between the first and second trophic level of the Lake ecosystem will be poor.																			1386-2588					JUN	2007	41	2					195	207		10.1007/s10452-007-9080-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-007-9080-8													WOS:000248109100006

The increased use of consumer products with nanosilver (nanoAg) may result in its release into the environment, and may particularly affect aquatic systems. The mechanisms of the harmful effects of nanoAg against aquatic organisms are unclear. Therefore, in the present study we investigate the pro-oxidative potential of these nanoparticles in experimentally exposed crayfish Orconectes limosus. Markers of oxidative stress and parameters of the antioxidant cell defense system such as total glutathione, glutathione reductase and the level of sulfhydryl groups were examined in the hepatopancreas of both sexes of O. limosus collected seasonally from Biale Lake (Poland) and subsequently exposed to nanoAg particles for 2 weeks. Exposure to nanoAg led to a high concentration-dependent increase in the rate of lipid peroxidation and a decrease of protein-bound SH groups which indicates protein oxidation. These markers of oxidative stress were accompanied by decreased levels of thiols and reduced activity of glutathione reductase. These results indicate a deficiency of reduced glutathione and suggest that the exposed organisms have less efficient antioxidative mechanisms available to counter ROS-mediated cellular stress. Furthermore, we find that confocal microscopy is of limited utility in monitoring the presence of silver nanoparticles in tissues of exposed crayfish.

A multicorer was successful in sampling the sediment-water interface, with 4 deployments retrieving 10 cores between 0.3 and 0.4 m in length. Gravity coring was also successful, retrieving cores of 0.97 and 1.78 m in glacial diamict. However, sediment cores retrieved by the gravity cores were shorter than the core barrel penetration (as measured by mud streaks on the outside of the coring system), indicating that the system can likely be improved.

Analysis of fish remains investigates fluctuations in the fish communities that are markers of changes in the paleoenvironment. The 8112 taxonomically identified remains document diagnostic taxa that are drought-tolerant (armoured catfishes, swamp-eels and tiger fishes) and from swampy environments, indicating probable occupation during low-waters periods. The results from Monte Castelo contrasts with the use of shell mounds as refuges from high-water season floods, a dominant hypothesis. A considerable shift in the nature of the fish spectrum occurred around 4000 BP with increased diversity; the number of taxa jumps from 18 to 48. The Middle Holocene occupations, from 6000 to 4000 BP, reflect long-term stability in drought-tolerant taxa collaborating with paleoecological evidence of dryer conditions. The post 4000 BP introduction of small-sized cichlids and characins suggests an initial exploitation of flooded forests. Archeological fish remains corroborate paleoenvironmental records of increased precipitation between the Middle and Late-Holocene. The probable replacement of some savanna areas by forest vegetation, and the accompanying alteration of aquatic landscapes, is documented through the presence/absence of certain taxa in Monte Castelo's occupations. This suggests new economic strategies and the exploitation of new ecological niches, as the fish remains correspond to approximately 80% of the vertebrate fauna throughout the archeological sequence.					; Pugliese, Francisco/ABH-6980-2020; Pugliese, Francisco/I-8631-2017; Zimpel, Carlos/N-9101-2013; Shock, Myrtle/LBI-3244-2024; Béarez, Philippe/D-2383-2012	Bearez, Philippe/0000-0003-0397-2393; Prestes-Carneiro, Gabriela/0000-0003-2958-5797; Pugliese, Francisco/0000-0002-2087-3875; Zimpel, Carlos/0000-0001-9876-9130; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2020	30	11					1606	1621	0959683620941108	10.1177/0959683620941108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620941108		JUL 2020											WOS:000550737800001
J	da Silva, ALL; Petrucio, MM				Lemes da Silva, Aurea Luiza; Petrucio, Mauricio Mello			Relationships between aquatic invertebrate communities, water-level fluctuations and different habitats in a subtropical lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In lakes, the littoral habitat and its invertebrate communities are often exposed to water-level fluctuations. We examined the effects of seasonal changes on water level, substrata availability and benthic fauna in the littoral zone of Pen Lake, a shallow lake that has experienced a strong reduction in water level due to changes in rainfall. In this study, we also examined whether the abundance and composition of aquatic invertebrates differed among the four substrata. Our main objective was to assess the effect of seasonal changes on water level and benthic invertebrates inhabiting the different types of substrata. Benthic invertebrates were sampled four different substrata (Schoenoplectus californicus, sand and stones, allochthonous leaf litter, and macrophyte stands), and we also measured meteorological, physical and chemical variables. We found that complex habitats, such as allochthonous leaf litter and aquatic macrophyte, stand to be colonised by a larger number of macroinveitebrates because they provide more habitats or potential niches for colonisation by different species. In addition, we observed that during periods of low water level, the presence of substrata in the littoral zone decreased, as did the associated biota. Therefore, our results suggest that water level changes have a major functional impact on the littoral zone of the lake, and can affect substratum availability, which also impacts invertebrate communities.					; Petrucio, Mauricio/AAC-6232-2019	Lemes da Silva, Aurea Luiza/0000-0001-8176-8983; Petrucio, Mauricio/0000-0002-7242-9426													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2018	190	9							548	10.1007/s10661-018-6929-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6929-3								30143869					WOS:000442776500001
J	Nayek, S; Gupta, S; Pobi, KK				Nayek, S.; Gupta, S.; Pobi, K. K.			Physicochemical characteristics and trophic state evaluation of post glacial mountain lake using multivariate analysis	GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM												The current study deals with the physicochemical characterization, temporal variability and trophic state evaluation of a post glacial mountain lake in eastern Himalaya during the period of 2014-2016. Notable seasonal variations are recorded for physicochemical parameters of lake water. The values for electrical conductivity, total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, total alkalinity and Chloride are higher during the rainy season. Concentrations of total phosphorous (136.78 +/- 29.14 mu g/L), total nitrogen (7177.78 +/- 1346.70 mu g/L) and Chlorophyll-a (38.54 +/- 21.67 mu g/L) in lake water are distinctly higher than the recommended standards for eutrophic condition of lake/surface water. Application of multivariate tools such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis reveals that ionic constituents of lake water are majorly associated to the geogenic and exogenic factors, with minor seasonal influences. Trophic state indices based on water transparency (3.15 +/- 1.57), total phosphorous (74.72 +/- 3.39), total nitrogen (82.64 +/- 2.83) exhibit hypertrophic nature of lake water; while trophic state index for chlorophyll-a indicate eutrophic condition. Deviations between Trophic state indices (TSIcHLa-TSIsp: -14 +/- 7.88, TSIcHLa-TSITp: -9.17 +/- 3.33, and TSIcHLa-TSITN : -17.56 +/- 5.29) infer that the nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) are not limiting factors for the algal biomass, and non-algal components such as suspended solids soil/sediment particles affects the light attenuation in the monitored lake. The observations reveal that trophic condition of monitored lake is in alarming stage. Therefore, measures should be taken on urgent basis in order to intercept the increasing trend in eutrophication, and for the restoration of water quality and integrated lake ecosystem.					; Gupta, Srimanta/AAD-6756-2021	Nayek, Sumanta/0000-0002-1164-4210; Gupta, Srimanta/0000-0001-8426-5388; 													2383-3572					FAL	2018	4	4					451	464		10.22034/gjesm.2018.04.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.22034/gjesm.2018.04.006													WOS:000446522500006

Genetic features of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses A(H5N8), isolated from the European part of the Russian Federation	INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION												Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) A(H5N8) of group B (Gochang1-like) have emerged in the Tyva Republic of eastern Russia in May 2016. Since November 2016, HPAIV A(H5N8) has spread throughout the European part of Russia. Thirty-one outbreaks were reported in domestic, wild and zoo birds in 2017. The present study aimed to perform a comparative analysis of new HPAIV A(H5N8) strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four genetically distinct subgroups in HPAIV A(H5N8) from the 2016-2017 season. Russian strains consisted of three subgroups with differences between isolates from Tyva, Siberia (Chany Lake), and the European part of Russia. Strains from the European part of Russia showed the beginnings of divergent evolution. Slight differences of the Voronezh strains were suggested by sensitivity to antiviral compounds. Testing for host-specific mutations in sequenced strains revealed the absence of mutations associated with possible increased tropism/virulence in mammalian species, including humans. Only one residue of polymerase basic-1, 13P, is discussed, because the L13P mutation increased complementary RNA synthesis in mammalian cells. We concluded that the evolution of HPAIV A(H5N8) is continuous. Surveillance in Russia revealed new cases of HPAIV A(H5N8) and led to the elaboration of prevention strategies, which should be implemented.					; Aksenova, Ekaterina/AAC-5727-2020; Borisevich, Sergey/Y-3925-2019; Kunda, Marina/F-4059-2018; Logunov, Denis/E-8300-2014; Ryzhova, Natalia/AAC-5948-2020; Voronina, Olga/F-4959-2018	Gintsburg, Alexander/0000-0003-1769-5059; Ryzhova, Natalya/0000-0001-5361-870X; Logunov, Denis/0000-0003-4035-6581; Chvala, Ilya/0000-0002-1659-3256; Kunda, Marina/0000-0003-1945-0397; Borisevich, Sergey/0000-0002-6742-3919; Voronina, Olga/0000-0001-7206-3594													1567-1348	1567-7257				SEP	2018	63						144	150		10.1016/j.meegid.2018.05.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.05.022								29852294					WOS:000442167600020

Reconciling diverse lacustrine and terrestrial system response to penultimate deglacial warming in southern Europe	GEOLOGY												Unlike the most recent deglaciation, the regional expression of climate changes during the penultimate deglaciation remains understudied, even though it led into a period of excess warmth with estimates of global average temperature 1-2 degrees C, and sea level similar to 6 m, above pre-industrial values. We present the first complete high-resolution southern European diatom record capturing the penultimate glacial-interglacial transition, from Lake Ioannina (northwest Greece). It forms part of a suite of proxies selected to assess the character and phase relationships of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem response to rapid climate warming, and to resolve apparent conflicts in proxy evidence for regional paleohydrology. The diatom data suggest a complex penultimate deglaciation driven primarily by multiple oscillations in lake level, and provide firm evidence for the regional influence of abrupt changes in North Atlantic conditions. There is diachroneity in lake and terrestrial ecosystem response to warming at the onset of the last interglacial, with an abrupt increase in lake level occurring similar to 2.7 k.y. prior to sustained forest expansion with peak precipitation. We identify the potentially important role of direct input of snow melt and glacial meltwater transfer to the subterranean karst system in response to warming, which would cause rising regional groundwater levels. This explanation, and the greater sensitivity of diatoms to subtle changes in temperature, reconciles the divergent lacustrine and terrestrial proxy evidence and highlights the sensitivity of lakes situated in mountainous karstic environments to past climate warming.					; Wilson, Graham/E-7901-2012; Frogley, Michael/H-2956-2016; Tzedakis, Polychronis/J-1894-2012	Hughes, Philip/0000-0002-8284-0219; Tzedakis, Polychronis/0000-0001-6072-1166; WILSON, GRAHAM/0000-0003-1252-4496; Frogley, Michael/0000-0003-4273-0901; 													0091-7613	1943-2682				SEP	2015	43	9					819	822		10.1130/G36807.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G36807.1													WOS:000360017400017

Home range and seasonal movement of taimen, Hucho taimen, in Mongolia	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Taimen, Hucho taimen, is the world's largest salmonid and a prized sport fish. We used radio and acoustic telemetry to characterise movements of adult taimen in an extensive river system, the Eg-Uur, in north-central Mongolia. Forty-six taimen were tagged with transmitters (27 radio, 17 acoustic and 2 radio-acoustic combined) and tracked from 2004 to 2008 using mobile surveys and fixed receivers. The mean home range of individual taimen tracked for an average of 2.4 years was 23 km (N = 41, range = 0.5-93.2 km). Of the fish with over 10 relocations (N = 16), 90% remained within a range of 38 km. Four distinct movement patterns were observed: (i) restricted core home range, (ii) core range with seasonal departures, (iii) core range with separate seasonal range and (iv) home range transfer. Movement was greatest in May and June (spawning and postspawning period) with another peak period of movement in September and October (water temperature cooling).

HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Several parts of the globe including Southeast North America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Australia, and China are often hit by hurricanes and tropical storms (HTSs), which can deliver a large amount of rainfall within a period of a few days. Although HTSs are mostly studied as disaster agents, considering that they occur during the period when water supply systems are generally depleted, it is important to ascertain their potential contributions toward sustaining water supply. Using the Lake Michie-Little River reservoir system that supplies water to the city of Durham (North Carolina) as a representative test case, we implemented an integrated watershed and reservoir management model, supported by publicly available observations, to evaluate the extent to which HTSs impact water storages. Results indicate that HTSs can have a significant impact on reservoir water storage, with their effects being felt for more than a year for some storms. The impact on reservoir water storage is identified to be primarily controlled by 3 factors, namely, streamflow response size from HTSs, storage in the reservoir right before the event, and streamflow succeeding the event response to HTS (henceforth referred as postevent streamflow). Although the impact of streamflow response size on water storage is generally proportional to its magnitude, initial water storage in the reservoir and postevent streamflow have a nonmonotonic influence on water storage. As all the 3 identified controls are a function of antecedent hydrologic conditions and meteorological forcings, these 2 factors indirectly influence the impact of HTS on water storage in a reservoir. The identification of controlling factors and assessment of their influence on reservoir response will further facilitate implementation of more accurate estimation and prediction frameworks for within-year reservoir operations.					; Marani, Marco/F-9451-2016; Kumar, Mukesh/AGO-6535-2022	Marani, Marco/0000-0002-1493-6913; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV 30	2017	31	24					4414	4428		10.1002/hyp.11371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11371													WOS:000416149500012

In this study, we found that the abundance of gas vesicles in Microcystis species, in parallel to the buoyancy of cells, increased in response to elevation of the extracellular pH. Within 48 h after pH upshift, gas vesicle protein genes (gvp) were upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels due to reduced decay of gvp transcripts. The effect of pH on GvpC level was basically unaffected by inorganic carbon availability. This is the first report that long-term pH range plays a role in controlling gas vesicle formation in certain Microcystis species.

Morphometry and mixing regime of a tropical lake: Lake Nova (Southeastern Brazil)	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												Lake Nova (15.5 km(2)) is the second largest lake in the Lower Doce River Valley (Southeastern Brazil). A better understanding of ecosystem structure and functioning requires knowledge about lake morphometry, given that lake basin form influences water column stratification. The present study aims to contribute to the understanding of relationship between morphometry and mixing patterns of deep tropical lakes in Brazil. Water column profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen were taken on four sampling sites along the lake major axis during 2011, 2012 and 2013. The bathymetric survey was carried out in July 2011, along 131.7 km of hydrographic tracks yield 51,692 depth points. Morphometric features of lake size and form factors describe the relative deep subrectangular elongated basin with maximum length of 15.7 km, shoreline development index 5.0, volume of 0.23 km(3), volume development of 1.3, and maximum, mean and relative depths of 33.9 m, 14.7 m and 0.7 %, respectively. The deep basin induces a monomictic pattern, with thermal stratification during the wet/warm season associated with anoxic bottom waters (1/3 of lake volume), and mixing during dry and cool season. Based on in situ measurements of tributary river discharges, theoretical retention time (RT) has been estimated in 13.4 years. The morphometry of Lake Nova promote long water RT and the warm monomictic mixing pattern, which is in accordance to the deep tropical lakes in Brazil.

A small marine lake (Rogoznica Lake, Croatia), which fluctuates between stably stratified and holomictic euxinic conditions, was used as a model to study the phytoplankton responses to environmental perturbations, in particular the anoxic stress, caused by periodic holomixia. The epilimnion showed significant temporal and vertical variability with a chlorophyll a subsurface maximum with the highest biomass near the chemocline. Fucoxanthin-containing biomass (diatoms) dominated in the epilimnion in colder seasons and was first to recover after holomictic euxinic events. The shift towards the smaller groups prevailed during highly stratified water column conditions in warmer seasons. Results for the hypolimnion were more enigmatic, with high concentrations of alloxanthin, zeaxanthin, and violaxanthin indicating the presence of a viable small-size mixotrophic community under extreme conditions.					; Čanković, Milan/AAE-8702-2020; ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013	Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN	2023	191								114931	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114931	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114931		APR 2023						37075558					WOS:000988045200001

Phytoplankton response to long-term wind dynamics at large shallow Lake Taihu (shallow lake phytoplankton response to long-term wind dynamics)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Shallow lakes are highly sensitive to respond wind dynamics. The phytoplankton biomass production and distribution scenarios vary annually and seasonally in shallow lakes. The present study investigated the impact of long-term wind dynamics to phytoplankton biomass at Lake Taihu. The response of phytoplankton taxonomic groups to annual and seasonal wind dynamics using generalized additive model showed significant correlation. The critical annual and seasonal wind speed was 2.2 m/s showing the highest correlation with phytoplankton biomass whereas, wind speed declined by 0.02 m/s annually from Jan 2000 to Dec 2016 at Lake Taihu. The lower to medium wind speeds with frequent directional switching toward shore areas developed higher mixing scenarios which helped in reduction of water temperatures, distribution and colony formation of phytoplankton near the Meiliang Bay. The onshore winds were most frequent winds with low wind speeds whereas, offshore winds have been observed with medium to higher wind speeds. The results of generalized additive model well described the wind impacts on phytoplankton biomass and successfully modeled the response of phytoplankton to wind speed. Therefore, it has been concluded that long-term wind dynamic control the movement, mixing and colony formation processes of phytoplankton at Lake Taihu. The fundamental mechanism found in the present study was the long-term higher variations (annual and seasonal) of the wind-induced phytoplankton biomass changes which has been considered as the major physical factor regulating the phytoplankton blooms formation in the large shallow lake Taihu.

There are many natural and artificial stagnant water habitats in the region that are used for irrigation and drinking water supply. This study is intended to determine the spatial-temporal variability and probabilistic health risk of fluoride exposure in the water of stagnant water bodies in the Thrace region. A total of 33 stagnant water bodies were selected, and water samples were collected during the dry and wet seasons of 2021-2022. The fluoride levels were measured using a spectrophotometric method (wavelength is 588 nm). The fluoride accumulations varied from 0.16-0.64 mg/L for the natural lakes, 0.04-0.74 mg/L for the reservoirs, and 0.01-0.53 mg/L for the artificial ponds. The World Health Organization (WHO) suggested a level of fluoride in drinking water of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L. The study area had a fluoride deficiency of less than 0.5 mg/L in natural water bodies during the wet season (87.87%) and the dry season (93.93%), which might be a potential threat to dental health. Estimation Daily Intake (EDI) and Hazard Quotient (HQ) widely used health risk assessment methods were applied to the data in the current research to describe the non-carcinogenic risk of fluoride. All the calculated hazard quotient (HQ) values, both in the dry and wet seasons and in all age groups, were recorded as below 1. Both teenagers and children living in the central part of the study area are at higher risk than infants and adults. To evaluate model uncertainty, Monte Carlo simulations were employed. The outcome of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the major risks to the health of the inhabitants are the high content of fluoride and their daily intake of water.					; Malafaia, Guilherme/G-6510-2013; Büyükgöze Dindar, Mediha/AAA-9038-2021; Onur, Şirin/AAL-3712-2021; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021; Muhammad, Said/AAD-4554-2021; Towfiqul Islam, Abu Reza Md./N-4022-2014; Islam, Abu Reza Md.

J	Roux, N; Costard, F; Grenier, C				Roux, Nicolas; Costard, Francois; Grenier, Christophe			Laboratory and Numerical Simulation of the Evolution of a River's Talik	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Experiments simulating the evolution of a river talik were performed in a cold room where a small channel carried flowing water through frozen saturated porous soil in a hydraulic flume. The sensitivity of thaw propagation to water temperature and velocity was determined to indicate the relative importance of these controlling parameters. Two types of soils were investigated (sand and silty clay), corresponding to contrasting hydrological, thermal and mechanical behaviours. The experimental results show that the sensitivity to water temperature was much higher than that to water velocity for the ranges considered. The experiments were compared with results from one-dimensional numerical simulations to identify the thermal boundary conditions of the riverbed and to evaluate the capacity of the numerical code to represent the propagation of heat at depth. The results showed that the proper boundary conditions are of the Neumann type, where flux is expressed as a coefficient multiplied by the temperature difference between water and the soil surface. The value of this coefficient is evaluated as a function of flow velocity based on these experiments. As a first-order approximation, this coefficient is assumed to be constant when considering seasonal flow variations.

J	Yechieli, Y; Wood, WW				Yechieli, Y; Wood, WW			Hydrogeologic processes in saline systems: playas, sabkhas, and saline lakes	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Pans, playas, sabkhas, Salinas, saline lakes, and salt flats are hydrologically similar, varying only in their boundary conditions. Thus, in evaluating geochemical processes in these systems, a generic water and solute mass-balance approach can be utilized. A conceptual model of a coastal sabkha near the Arabian Gulf is used as an example to illustrate the various water and solute fluxes. Analysis of this model suggests that upward flux of ground water from underlying formations could be a major source of solutes in the sabkha, but contribute only a small volume of the water. Local rainfall is the main source of water in the modeled sabkha system with a surprisingly large recharge-to-rainfall ratio of more than 50%. The contribution of seawater to the solute budget depends on the ratio of the width of the supratidal zone to the total width and is generally confined to a narrow zone near the shoreline of a typical coastal sabkha. Because of a short residence time of water, steady-state flow is expected within a short time (<100 years), while steady state for solutes may take much longer (>50,000 years). The solute composition of the brine in a closed saline system depends largely on the original composition of the input water. The high total ion content in the brine limits the efficiency of water-rock interaction and absorption. Because most natural systems are hydrologically open, the chemistry of the brines and the associated evaporite deposits may be significantly different than that predicted for hydrologically closed systems. Seasonal changes in temperature of the unsaturated zone cause precipitation of minerals in saline systems undergoing evaporation. Thus, during the hot dry season months, minerals exhibit retrograde solubility so that gypsum, anhydrite and calcite precipitate. Evaporation near the surface is also a major process that causes mineral precipitation in the upper portion of the unsaturated zone (e.g. halite and carnallite), provided that the relative humidity of the atmosphere is less, than the activity of water. The slope of the fresh/brine-water interface in saline lake systems is shallower than in fresh/seawater interface because of the greater density difference between the fresh/brine-water bodies. The interface between sabkha brines and seawater slopes seaward, unlike normal marine-fresh water systems that slope landward. Moreover, the brine/seawater interface does not achieve steady state because it is pushed toward the sea by the sabkha's brine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Determining their relative importance is necessary, since waves are capable of coordinated systematic momentum transport accompanying the wave propagation, and associated wind forcing, in ways that 2-D turbulence is not. This can impact weather forecasting. Using a network of ten windprofiler radars in eastern Ontario and western Quebec in Canada, plus an additional one in the Arctic, the relative roles of internal gravity (buoyancy) waves and two-dimensional turbulence are examined at temporal scales from about 3-4 hrs to several tens of hours (horizontal spatial scales of typically one or two hundred kilometres to a few thousand kilometres), with the purpose of investigating the respective roles of these two distinct characteristic fluid motions as functions of location, season and year. The emphasis is on studies of spectral slope variability, rather than absolute spectral magnitudes, giving a perspective not previously substantially presented. In particular, we have found a frequency band in which gravity-wave Doppler shifting produces distinctly different spectral slopes than those predicted for 2-D turbulence, and these differences are employed to distinguish the flow fields. The network used (excluding the Arctic site) covers an area of similar to 10(6) km(2) and includes a variety of different terrains. Radial velocities have been recorded on time scales of minutes for data lengths covering durations of up to 12 years. Altitude coverage is from 1 km to typically 14 km, at 500 m resolution. Results suggest a region from similar to 2 to similar to 5 km altitude (deeper for some radars) where waves are weaker and 2-D turbulence appears to be generally more significant, but where occasional bursts of gravity-wave activity can occur, while above typically 6-8 km, gravity waves increase in significance. There are distinct site-to-site variations.

Diet Patterns and Niche Overlap of Muskellunge and Co-Occurring Piscivores in Minnesota Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, Northern Pike E. lucius, Walleye Sander vitreus, and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides are popular sport fish that often co-occur in aquatic systems. Although numerous studies have investigated interactions among these species, the simultaneous evaluation of diet patterns and niche overlap among all four species has not been conducted. Our experimental design aimed to quantify diet overlap among Muskellunge and the other piscivores, while lakes without Muskellunge were also sampled to compare the diets of the other piscivores in their presence or absence. Diets of piscivores from 10 Minnesota lakes were collected via gastric lavage and quantified using an index of relative importance. Diets of individual species were compared among seasons and predator length categories, and among-species comparisons were also conducted by season and relative to Muskellunge presence using permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA). Muskellunge consumed a wide range of prey, whereas Northern Pike and Walleye diets consisted primarily of Yellow Perch Perca flavescens and centrarchids. Largemouth Bass consumed more invertebrates, especially crayfish Faxonius spp. No species exhibited seasonal diet shifts, but diets were different among length categories for all species except Walleye. Although nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations indicated shared prey use, PERMANOVA results indicated that the diets of Muskellunge and Largemouth Bass were most different from each other and the other piscivores' diets across all seasons. Conversely, Northern Pike and Walleye diets were similar regardless of season or Muskellunge presence. Finally, lake-scale habitat variables were correlated with piscivore diets, and Yellow Perch abundance was correlated with Walleye diets. Our results indicate that while Muskellunge, Northern Pike, Walleye, and Largemouth Bass can coexist in a variety of lakes, populations of important prey and habitat variables should be examined before management actions (e.g., stocking) are implemented to ensure adequate prey availability and to ensure that competition among these piscivores is not increased to the detriment of existing fisheries.					; Glade, Kamden/GYR-1143-2022	Glade, Kamden/0000-0002-0185-656X; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2023	43	3					656	676		10.1002/nafm.10880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10880		APR 2023											WOS:000971090500001

Contrary to this viewpoint, fungal ectoparasites assume a great importance since they are integral components in shaping community, ecosystem structure, and energy flow, Here we described the fungal species co-occurrence patterns (species segregation/aggregation) using null models comparing the occurrence frequencies of ectosymbiots through host individuals with those expected by chance. Non-indigenous crayfish species like Procambarus clarkii allow to observe phenomena of competitive exclusion (segregation) or mutualism (aggregation) amongst fungi. We analyzed the fungal species occurrence on 86 host crayfish monthly collected from June 2007 to June 2008 in the Lake Trasimeno (Central Italy). A total of 29 fungal taxa were detected. Taxa showed a particular fungal assemblage with a great species variation depending on sampling month and crayfish sex, size, and body region. In particular fungal species showed different occurrence patterns in both richness and segregation/aggregation. The fungal community shows a non-random structure not in all cases, with the majority of tests indicating segregation, not aggregation of ectosymbiontic species on hosts. The non-random patterns of fungal co-occurrence in some cases suggest that some temporally or spatially variable factors are responsible for the establishment of the mycoflora community assemblage. We also detected temporal differences in fungal co-occurrences patterns. Regarding seasonal samples, the Same analyses showed a competitive structure only in the sub-communities found on pleopodal coxae. In addition, analyses considering crayfish dimension evidenced non-random co-occurrence patterns only in crayfish hosts with a cephalothorax length larger than 45 mm. Our results demonstrated that, depending on sampling month and crayfish sex, size, and body region, well structured fungal assemblages on crayfish hosts can alternate with random fungal assemblages. Whenever non-randomness of fungal co-occurrence was detected, it hinted segregation, suggesting the lack of co-evolutive phenomena of mutualism, and favoring a competitive exclusion among the mycoflora species.					; Elia, Antonia/F-4646-2014; D'Amen, Manuela/L-8272-2016; Elia, Antonia Concetta/F-4646-2014; Doerr, Ambrosius/G-9915-2014; Garzoli, Laura/AAX-8010-2020	SCALICI, Massimiliano/0000-0002-5677-8837; RODOLFI, Marinella/0000-0003-4745-3288; D'Amen, Manuela/0000-0001-5910-4267; Elia, Antonia Concetta/0000-0002-7750-6339; Doerr, Ambrosius/0000-0002-2768-3783; Garzoli, Laura/0000-0003-1353-9120													1129-5767	1723-8633					2012	71	1					135	143		10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e14	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e14													WOS:000303943400014

However, there is evidence that grazing by protozoans exerts top-down controls on biomass. Here, we investigate top-down control by phage on soil microbes using an experimental site near Barrow, Alaska (71 degrees N, 157 degrees W) during the 2007 growing season. Soil measurements were taken from sites that covered a range of microtopographical features within a drained and thawed lake basin including high- and low-centred ice-wedge polygons to estimate the availability of carbon and nitrogen for microbes. Using both field and laboratory experiments, we successfully increased both microbial biomass and respiration by decreasing phage populations. The addition of carbon and nutrients to soils had no significant effects on biomass or respiration, indicating a lack of bottom-up controls. Additionally, we present the first use of tea extracts as a potent anti-phage agent in soils. Our results suggest that top-down controls, such as phage predation, are critical to regulation of microbial activities in Arctic soils.

Both hazard quotients of individual metals and HI of total non-carcinogenic risk in each TWTP were lower than 1.0, suggesting that these pollutants posed negligible hazards to public health of local residents. Temporal and spatial comparisons showed that high HIs occurred more frequently in low water seasons, and the three TWTPs located along Huaihe River (Dongtai, Jinhu and Yishuichang) had relatively higher HIs.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2011	177	1-4					449	456		10.1007/s10661-010-1646-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1646-6								20706795					WOS:000290732300033
J	Rokitnicki-Wojcik, D; Wei, AH; Chow-Fraser, P				Rokitnicki-Wojcik, Daniel; Wei, Anhua; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Transferability of object-based rule sets for mapping coastal high marsh habitat among different regions in Georgian Bay, Canada	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Coastal wetlands of eastern and northern Georgian Bay, Canada provide critical habitat for a variety of biota yet few have been delineated and mapped because of their widespread distribution and remoteness. This is an impediment to conservation efforts aimed at identifying significant habitat in the Laurentian Great Lakes. We propose to address this deficiency by developing an approach that relies on use of high-resolution remote sensing imagery to map wetland habitat. In this study, we use IKONOS satellite imagery to classify coastal high marsh vegetation (seasonally inundated) and assess the transferability of object-based rule sets among different regions in eastern Georgian Bay. We classified 24 wetlands in three separate satellite scenes and developed an object-based approach to map four habitat classes: emergent, meadow/shrub, senescent vegetation and rock. Independent rule sets were created for each scene and applied to the other images to empirically examine transferability at broad spatial scales. For a given habitat feature, the internally derived rule sets based on field data collected from the same scene provided significantly greater accuracy than those derived from a different scene (80.0 and 74.3%, respectively). Although we present a significant effect of ruleset origin on accuracy, the difference in accuracy is minimal at 5.7%. We argue that this should not detract from its transferability on a regional scale. We conclude that locally derived and object-based rule sets developed from IKONOS imagery can successfully classify complex vegetation classes and be applied to different regions without much loss of accuracy. This indicates that large-scale mapping automation may be feasible with images with similar spectral, spatial, contextual, and textural properties.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				JUN	2011	19	3					223	236		10.1007/s11273-011-9213-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-011-9213-7													WOS:000292967000002
J	Li, Q; Huang, JC; Zhang, J; Gao, JF				Li, Qi; Huang, Jiacong; Zhang, Jing; Gao, Junfeng			A raster-based estimation of watershed phosphorus load and its impacts on surrounding rivers based on process-based modelling	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Quantifying phosphorus (P) load from watersheds at a fine scale is crucial for studying P sources in lake or river ecosystems; however, it is particularly challenging for mountain-lowland mixed watersheds. To address this challenge, we proposed a framework to estimate the P load at the grid scale and assessed its risk to surrounding rivers in a typical mountain-lowland mixed watershed (Huxi Region in Lake Taihu Basin, China). The framework coupled three models: the Phosphorus Dynamic model for lowland Polder systems (PDP), the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and the Export Coefficient Model (ECM). The coupled model performed satisfactory for both hydrological and water quality variables (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >0.5). Our modelling practice revealed that polder, non-polder, and mountainous areas had P load of 211.4, 437.2, and 149.9 t yr- 1, respectively. P load intensity in lowlands and mountains was 1.75 and 0.60 kg ha-1 yr- 1, respectively. A higher P load intensity (>3 kg ha-1 yr- 1) was mainly observed in the non-polder area. In lowland areas, irrigated cropland, aquaculture ponds and impervious surfaces contributed 36.7%, 24.8%, and 25.8% of the P load, respectively. In mountainous areas, irrigated croplands, aquaculture ponds, and impervious surfaces contributed 28.6%, 27.0%, and 16.4% of the P load, respectively. Rivers with relatively high P load risks were mainly observed around big cities during rice season, owing to a large contribution of P load from the non-point source pollution of urban and agricultural activities. This study demonstrated a raster-based estimation of watershed P load and their impacts on surrounding rivers using coupled process-based models. It would be useful to identify the hotspots and hot moments of P load at the grid scale.

We conducted this study in a large drinking water reservoir for 11 years (2010-2020). The variabilities of ambient nutrients and total suspended solids (TSS) throughout the seasonal monsoon-mediated flow regime influenced algal chlorophyll (Chl-a) levels. The study determined the role of the monsoon-mediated flow regime on reservoir water chemistry. The reservoir conditions were mesotrophic to eutrophic based on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. An occasional total coliform bacteria (TCB) count of 16,000 MPN per 100 mL was recorded in the reservoir, presenting a significant risk of waterborne diseases among children. A Mann-Kendall test identified a consistent increase in water temperature, conductivity, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) over the study period, limiting a sustainable water supply. The drought and flood regime mediated by the monsoon resulted in large heterogeneities in Chl-a, TCB, TSS, and nutrients (N, P), indicating its role as a key regulator of the ecological functioning of the reservoir. The ambient N:P ratio is a reliable predictor of sestonic Chl-a productivity, and the reservoir was P-limited. Total phosphorus (TP) had a strong negative correlation (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.05) with the outflow from the dam, while both the TSS (R-2 = 0.50) and Chl-a (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.05) had a strong positive correlation with the outflow. A seasonal trophic state index revealed oligo-mesotrophic conditions, indicating a limited risk of eutrophication and a positive outcome for long-term management. In conclusion, the Asian monsoon largely controlled the flood and drought conditions and manipulated the flow regime. Exceedingly intensive crop farming in the basin may lead to oligotrophic nutrient enrichment. Although the reservoir water quality was good, we strongly recommend stringent action to alleviate sewage, nutrient, and pollutant inflows to the reservoir.</p>					; Atique, Usman/Q-1454-2018; Mamun, Md/ABD-5980-2021	Kim, Ji Yoon/0000-0001-8884-2576; Atique, Usman/0000-0001-9178-8443; 														1660-4601				OCT	2021	18	20							10714	10.3390/ijerph182010714	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010714								34682459					WOS:000715087800001

Here, we measured water balance and limnological variables (water chemistry, suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a) at 20 ponds near Churchill (Manitoba) three times during the ice-free season of 2010 to explore relations among hydrological connectivity, basin morphometry, and water-chemistry variations. Using principal components analysis, we identified that the ponds followed one of four distinctive "seasonal water chemistry trajectories" (SWCT1-4). Most of the ponds that lacked apparent hydrologic connectivity displayed SWCT1, characterized by rising alkalinity and ionic content between early June and late July due to evaporative concentration. In contrast, most ponds with apparent hydrological connectivity displayed SWCT2 or SWCT3, characterized by marked changes in suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations due to inflow that transferred allochthonous materials from the catchment. Ponds in SWCT2 likely possessed temporary hydrological connections during periods of relatively high water supply and exhibited marked decline of suspended sediment and total nitrogen content when hydrological connection was lost. Most ponds in SWCT3 maintained active hydrological connections during all or most of the ice-free season and possessed relatively high suspended sediment and total nitrogen concentrations throughout the season. Ponds in SWCT4 possessed relatively stable water chemistry due to greater water depth and local features that reduced wind-induced sediment resuspension. We conclude that hydrological connectivity and basin morphometry exert important influence on seasonal pond water-chemistry dynamics.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019; Macrae, Merrin/KPB-7902-2024	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; Macrae, Merrin/0000-0003-3296-3103													1523-0430	1938-4246				FEB	2014	46	1			SI		218	235		10.1657/1938-4246-46.1.218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-46.1.218													WOS:000333866100016

Comparing seasonal dynamics of the Lake Huron zooplankton community between 1983-1984 and 2007 and revisiting the impact of Bythotrephes planktivory	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Zooplankton community composition can be influenced by lake productivity as well as planktivory by fish or invertebrates. Previous analyses based on long-term Lake Huron zooplankton data from August reported a shift in community composition between the 1980s and 2000s: proportional biomass of calanoid copepods increased while that of cyclopoid copepods and herbivorous cladocerans decreased. Herein, we used seasonally collected data from Lake Huron in 1983-1984 and 2007 and reported similar shifts in proportional biomass. We also used a series of generalized additive models to explore differences in seasonal abundance by species and found that all three cyclopoid copepod species (Diacyclops thomasi, Mesocylops edax, Tropocyclops prasinus mexicanus) exhibited higher abundance in 1983-1984 than in 2007. Surprisingly, only one (Epischura lacustris) of seven calanoid species exhibited higher abundance in 2007. The results for cladocerans were also mixed with Bosmina spp. exhibiting higher abundance in 1983-1984, while Daphnia galeata mendotae reached a higher level of abundance in 2007. We used a subset of the 2007 data to estimate not only the vertical distribution of Bythotrephes longimanus and their prey, but also the consumption by Bythotrephes in the top 20 m of water. This epilimnetic layer was dominated by copepod copepodites and nauplii, and consumption either exceeded (Hammond Bay site) or equaled 65% (Detour site) of epilimnetic zooplankton production. The lack of spatial overlap between Bythotrephes and herbivorous cladocerans and cyclopoid copepod prey casts doubt on the hypothesis that Bythotrephes planktivory was the primary driver underlying the community composition changes in the 2000s.

The 'b' value was higher in lake having the lowest nutrient enrichment level, showing that water quality may influence the growth of a fish. The results showed positive allometric growth (b>3.0; heavy group) in Manasbal and Anchar Lakes and isometric growth of equal increment of both parameters of length and weight in the Dal Lake. The correlation between length-weight relationships showed significant (P<0.05) positive trend. Females showed 'b' value more than males in two lakes (Anchar and Manasbal lakes), whereas 'b' value was high in males (b = 2.8) in Dal Lake. Data showed significant (P<0.05) differences in 'b' value between male and female sexes in two lakes and insignificant (P>0.05) relationship in Anchar Lake. Multiple comparisons also showed significant (P<0.05) differences in 'b' values among different seasons in Dal Lake. In addition, 'b' value showed significant (P<0.05) difference with some physico-chemical features in Dal lake. Finally, we concluded that length-weight relationship in case of Crucian carp showed significant variation in three lakes with respect to water quality, season and sex.					zargar, ummer/AAT-2979-2021; Mushtaq, Basharat/AAU-3955-2020														1303-2712					SEP	2012	12	3					683	689		10.4194/1303-2712-v12_3_17	http://dx.doi.org/10.4194/1303-2712-v12_3_17													WOS:000314625500017

The 2001 mortality of anadromous brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) in the Sutton River in the Hudson Bay Lowlands may be the first documented case of an increasing number of such events, as climate warming affects north latitude systems. Warm air temperatures (daily maximums > 30A degrees C) combined with unusual thermal stratification conditions in the upstream lake appeared to have created the lethal conditions, but changing marine environments likely triggered the event. This highly productive brook charr population depends heavily on the local marine environment, not only for food, but also to moderate the continental climate of the region. The steadily shortening ice season in Hudson Bay appears to be greatly increasing the vulnerability of anadromous stocks to warming events.					; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012	Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2010	650	1					79	84		10.1007/s10750-010-0201-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0201-3													WOS:000278938600008

Temporal Patterns in Glycolate-Utilizing Bacterial Community Composition Correlate with Phytoplankton Population Dynamics in Humic Lakes	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Previous observations of correlated community dynamics between phytoplankton and bacteria in lakes indicate that phytoplankton populations may influence bacterial community structure. To investigate the possibility that bacterial use of phytoplankton exudates contributes to observed patterns of community change, we characterized the diversity and dynamics of heterotrophic bacterioplankton with genetic potential to use glycolate, a photorespiration-specific exudate, in five lakes over a 15-week period. Culture-independent approaches were used to track different bacterial phylotypes represented by DNA sequence variation in the functional gene glycolate oxidase subunit D (glcD). glcD gene sequences from freshwater bacteria exhibited broad phylogenetic diversity, including sequences representing the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia. The majority of glcD gene sequences were betaproteobacterial, with 48% of the sequences clustering with the glcD gene from the cosmopolitan freshwater species Polynucleobacter necessarius. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the glcD gene revealed changes in glycolate-utilizing assemblages over time. An average of 39% of within-lake temporal variation in glycolate-utilizing assemblages across five lakes was explained by phytoplankton community composition and dynamics. The interaction between phytoplankton populations and the environment explained an additional 17% of variation on average. These observations offer new insight into the diversity and temporal dynamics of freshwater bacteria with genetic potential to use glycolate and support the hypothesis that algal exudates influence the structure of bacterial communities.

We tested the interference of the macrophyte coverage in taxonomic and functional structure of phytoplankton community. Twelve small reservoirs were visited in September 2015 and May 2016 in semiarid regions of Brazilian northeast. Water samples were collected and abiotic variables were measured using a probe. Macrophyte coverage was recorded using the dot method. The microalgae were classified using taxonomic classification (taxa), morphological functional classification (MBFG) and functional groups (FG). We found 242 taxa, 22 FG and the seven MBFG. Phytoplankton presented an average biomass of 3.8 mg L-1 and a richness average of 38 species in dry period, while during the rainy season the biomass value was 6.2 mg L-1 and the richness, 33 species. The macrophytes had the highest average cover during the rainy season (63%) than the dry season (32%). Spearman analyses showed no correlation between total macrophyte coverage and biomass and richness (taxonomic and functional) of phytoplankton (P>0.05). However, the growth form of emergent and free-floating macrophytes were selected as explanatory variables in the CCA model performed with the MBFG classification. This model presented greatest explanatory power (57%) when compared to FG classification (21%) and taxonomy (20%). Considering our results, using the MBFG classification is recommended for studies with similar sampling design, because it presents greater explanatory power and expresses the relationship between phytoplankton and aquatic macrophytes.

Climate and intraspecific competition control the growth and life history of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Iliamna Lake, Alaska	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Recent climate changes have had marked effects oil the ice-free season and thermal conditions in marly high-latitude lakes, but their ecological effects combine with density-dependent processes to affect fish growth and life history. To better understand the relative roles of climate and intraspecific density, we applied Gaussian state-space models to long-term data (1962-2006) oil growth of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in Iliamna Lake, Alaska, USA. Both temperature and density influenced fry size at the end of their first growing season, but the positive effect of temperature exceeded the negative effects of density. Fry growth was affected by the magnitude of their own cohort more strongly than by the previous brood (i.e., yearlings). In contrast, density was more important (hall temperature in Lake Aleknagik, also in Bristol Bay, over the same period of record. probably because Iliamna Lake is cooler and has generally lower densities of juvenile sockeye salmon than Lake Aleknagik. In both lakes, the size of the fish at the end of the first growing season affects smolt size and m,e at seaward migration, hence survival at sea and age at Maturity, so the relative effects of climate and density depend oil the ecological context.

Riverine particulate 0.5 N HCl leachable trace metal concentrations are mainly controlled by Fe-oxides. Complexation of Fe by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) appears to be an important determinant of the phases transporting trace metals in Patagonian rivers. In contrast, aeolian trace elements have a combined crustal and anthropogenic origin. Aeolian materials have Fe, Mn, and Al contents similar to that found in regional topsoils. However, seasonal concentrations of some metals (e.g., Co, Ph, Cu, and Zn) are much higher than expected from normal crustal weathering and are likely pollutant derived. We estimate that Patagonian sediments are supplied to the South Atlantic shelf in approximately equivalent amounts from the atmosphere (similar to30 X 10(6) T yr(-1)) and coastal erosion (similar to40 X 10(6) T yr(-1)) with much less coming from the rivers (similar to2.0 X 10(6) T yr(-1)). Low trace metal riverine fluxes are linked to the low suspended particulate load of Patagonian rivers, inasmuch most of it is retained in pro-glacial lakes as well as in downstream reservoirs. Based on our estimation of aeolian dust fluxes at the Patagonian coastline, the high nutrient-low chlorophyll sub Antarctic South Atlantic could receive 1.0 to 4.0 mg m(-2) yr(-1) of leachable (0.5 N HCl) Fe. Past and present volcanic activity in the southern Andes-through the ejection of tephra-must be highlighted as another important source of Fe to the South Atlantic Ocean. Based on the 1991 Hudson volcano eruption, it appears that volcanic events can contribute several thousand-fold the mass of "leachable" Fe to the ocean as is introduced by annual Patagonian dust fallout.

Trophic state resilience to hurricane disturbance of Lake Yojoa, Honduras	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Cyclones are a poorly described disturbance in tropical lakes, with the potential to alter ecosystems and compromise the services they provide. In November 2020, Hurricanes Eta and Iota made landfall near the Nicaragua-Honduras border, inundating the region with a large amount of late-season precipitation. To understand the impact of these storms on Lake Yojoa, Honduras, we compared 2020 and 2021 conditions using continuous (every 16 days) data collected from five pelagic locations. The storms resulted in increased Secchi depth and decreased algal abundance in December 2020, and January and February 2021, and lower-than-average accumulation of hypolimnetic nutrients from the onset of stratification (April 2021) until mixus in November 2021. Despite the reduced hypolimnetic nutrient concentrations, epilimnetic nutrient concentrations returned to (and in some cases exceeded) pre-hurricane levels following annual water column turnover in 2021. This response suggests that Lake Yojoa's trophic state had only an ephemeral response to the disturbance imposed by the two hurricanes, likely due to internal input of sediment derived nutrients. These aseasonal storms acted as a large-scale experiment that resulted in nutrient dilution and demonstrated the resilience of Lake Yojoa's trophic state to temporary nutrient reductions.					; Fadum, Jemma/C-4715-2018	Waters, Matthew/0000-0003-1702-3973; Fadum, Jemma/0000-0002-3206-4338													2045-2322					APR 7	2023	13	1							5681	10.1038/s41598-023-32712-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32712-3								37029170					WOS:000983833600021

Rothwell to Biodiversity and Evolution	JUL 25, 2018	Rochester, MN	Botan Soc Amer				Premise of research.Recent classifications of Anacardiaceae recognize two subfamilies, Anacardioideae and Spondioideae. Most genera within Spondioideae are still recognized for having drupes with sclerified stones that vary in locule number and germination mechanisms. Spondioid fruits have been recognized in the Cenozoic fossil record of Europe, Asia, and North America. However, they have remained elusive in the Neotropics, where today they are an important component of tropical rain forests and seasonally dry tropical forests. Here, we describe three new species of fossil endocarps related to Spondias, Dracontomelon, and Antrocaryon.Methodology.Fossil endocarps were collected from the 19-18.5 Ma (early Miocene) Cucaracha Formation, Panama Canal. The fossils were studied by physical sections, acetate peels, and X-ray microtomography. The fossil endocarps were exhaustively compared with all extant genera of Spondioideae.Pivotal results.Spondias rothwellii sp. nov. and Antrocaryon panamaensis sp. nov. are so far the earliest and best evidence of these genera in the Neotropics. Dracontomelon montesii sp. nov. extends the occurrence of this genus to the early Miocene in Central America.Conclusions.The new Cucaracha fossils reveal that Spondioideae were a significant part of the early Miocene forests in Panama. The extant natural habitats and occurrences of the newly recognized genera suggest multistratified rain forests and active biogeographical patterns for Spondioideae approximately 19 million years ago in southern Central America.

Within- and between-lakes differences in water-particulate phase partition coefficient (K-p) were not related to total suspended matter, phytoplankton biomass, or taxonomic composition. Yet, a seasonal relationship between K-p and K-ow was detected for both lakes, revealing equilibrium of PCBs partition when lakes were ice covered. On the contrary, PCBs partitioning between particles and water appeared kinetically limited during the open water season. Partition is therefore mainly governed by thermodynamic laws during the ice-covered period, while none of the tested physical or biological parameters seemed to explain the distribution of these particle-reactive contaminants in the open water period. PCBs were always mainly associated with particulate matter, but partitioning within different particulate size-fractions varied between seasons and between years during open water periods. When ice cover is absent, PCBs were mainly adsorbed on microplankton, the largest phytoplanktonic size fraction, which is the least likely to get grazed by pelagic microconsumers.

We examine MODIS-derived grassland vegetation and snow cover of the Qinghai Lake basin and their relations with climate parameters during 2001 to 2010. Results show: (1) temperature and precipitation of the Qinghai Lake basin increased while evaporation decreased; (2) most of the grassland areas improved due to increased temperature and growing season precipitation; (3) weak relations between snow cover and precipitation/vegetation; (4) a significantly negative correlation between lake area and temperature (r = -0.9, p < 0.05); and (5) a positive relation between lake level (lake-level difference) and temperature (precipitation). Compared with Namco Lake (located in the inner Tibetan Plateau) where the primary water source of lake level increases was the accelerated melt of glacier/perennial snow cover in the lake basin, for the Qinghai Lake, however, it was the increased precipitation. Increased precipitation explained the improvement of vegetation cover in the Qinghai Lake basin, while accelerated melt of glacier/perennial snow cover was responsible for the degradation of vegetation cover in Namco Lake basin. These results suggest different responses to the similar warming climate: improved (degraded) ecological condition and productive capacity of the Qinghai Lake basin (Namco Lake basin).

Temporal and spatial trends in water quality of Lake Taihu, China: analysis from a north to mid-lake transect, 1991-2011	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Interpretations of state and trends in lake water quality are generally based on measurements from one or more stations that are considered representative of the response of the lake ecosystem. The objective of this study is to examine how these interpretations may be influenced by station location in a large lake. We addressed this by analyzing trends in water quality variables collected monthly from eight monitoring stations along a transect from the central lake to the north in Lake Taihu (area about 2,338 km(2)), China, from October 1991 to December 2011. The parameters examined included chlorophyll a (Chl a), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, and Secchi disk depth (SD). The individual variables were increasingly poorly correlated among stations along the transect from the central lake to the north, particularly for Chl a and TP. The timing of peaks in individual variables was also dependent on station location, with spectral analysis revealing a peak at annual frequency for the central lake station but absence of, or much reduced signal, at this frequency for the near-shore northern station. Percentage annual change values for each of the four variables also varied with station and indicated general improvement in water quality at northern stations, particularly for TN, but little change or decline at central lake stations. Sediment resuspension and tributary nutrient loads were considered to be responsible for some of the variability among stations. Our results indicate that temporal trends in water quality may be station specific in large lakes and that calculated whole-lake trophic status trends or responses to management actions may be specific to the station(s) selected for monitoring and analysis. These results have important implications for efficient design of monitoring programs that are intended to integrate the natural spatial variability of large lakes.

J	Yamamoto, KC; Freitas, CED; Zuanon, J; Hurd, LE				Yamamoto, Kedma Cristine; de Carvalho Freitas, Carlos Edwar; Zuanon, Jansen; Hurd, Lawrence Edward			Fish diversity and species composition in small-scale artificial reefs in Amazonian floodplain lakes: Refugia for rare species?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												We designed a controlled experiment to evaluate the effects of introducing small-scale artificial reefs on fish species composition and diversity in four black water lakes located on islands in the Anavilhanas National Park in the Rio Negro, Amazonas, Brazil. We built eight 37.5 m(3) artificial reefs consisting of frames enclosing wooden branches to provide habitat complexity, and placed two of them in each lake approximately 60 m from the margins, one situated close to a forest that abuts the lake directly, and one close to a sand/clay beach between the edge of the lake and the forest. Controls consisted of open water areas 100 m from the reefs and the same distance from the lake margins as the reefs. We collected fish with gill nets in 2009 and 2010 in each of these lakes, during the four main phases of the hydrologic cycle (flooding, high water, receding, and low water). Rarefaction curves indicated that we had sampled sufficiently to represent the species diversity at these sites. ANOSIM indicated no difference the two types of lake margin, and only season of the hydrologic cycle was a statistically significant response variable. Shannon's diversity index (H') and Pielou's evenness (J') did not allow us to reject the null hypothesis that reefs do not enhance overall diversity, but we did reject this hypothesis on the basis of substantial differences in community composition: of the 107 species collected, 69 were found at both reefs and control sites, but 26 were only found at reefs and 12 only at control sites. The unique species at reef sites were mainly those of low abundance, and which therefore had relatively little effect on the composite diversity indices. These were mainly species that do not migrate out of the lake as part of the life cycle and use the flooded forest as refuge from predators, so the seasonal unavailability of the flooded forest habitat during the dry hydrologic phase probably keeps their populations at low density. Artificial reefs may therefore function to buffer rare and non-migratory species from local extinction in times of drought, and should be considered in efforts to preserve aquatic biodiversity.

A plant-based index of biological integrity in permanent marsh wetlands yields consistent scores in dry and wet years	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Plant-based assessments can contribute to wetland conservation and management by providing a standardized method to monitor biological communities in relation to human activity. One major challenge, however, is that their measurements must be fairly insensitive to temporal variation in community composition, which can be difficult since marsh plant communities are known to be influenced by natural climatic cycles. Variation in the scores for an index of biological integrity (IBI) was evaluated in relation to plant community changes that occurred between years with differing precipitation inputs throughout the growing season (dry: 240mm in 2008, 198mm in 2009; wet: 324mm in 2010, 329mm in 2011). Species composition and IBI scores were measured by sampling macrophytes in the centre of the wet meadow zone at 47 semi-permanent to permanent natural and constructed marshes. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordinations revealed that although plant community composition shifted between dry and wet years, IBI scores were sensitive to only 21% of the total inter-annual variation in species composition. The first NMS axis was positively correlated with IBI scores (r=0.85) as well as several environmental parameters (r(2)>0.2), including dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, potassium, shoreline slope, and salinity. The wet meadow IBI also yielded consistent scores between dry and wet years (Spearman's rho=0.82; Wilcoxon z-score=0.53, P-value=0.60) and was able to distinguish a change in biological condition among sites against a backdrop of natural variation (F-test=3.0, P<0.001). These findings provide support for the continued use of plants as indicators of wetland condition in permanent northern prairie marshes, providing that the range in water levels is moderate.

Holocene climate change and carbon cycling in a groundwater-fed, boreal forest lake: Dune Lake, Alaska	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Opal, organic C and N contents, and organic delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes were analyzed on a sedimentary sequence spanning the past similar to 12,000 years from Dune Lake, a shallow groundwater-fed lake in the boreal forest region of central interior Alaska. The chronology, based on Pb-210 and 15 AMS radiocarbon dates on terrestrial materials, indicates that 5 m of biogenic sediment accumulated following dune stabilization at similar to 10,000 cal yr BP. Previous studies on lake level and pollen were synthesized with these data to assess Holocene changes in hydrogeology and climate. Variability in groundwater level and flux has a strong control on lake level and are negatively correlated with the delta C-13 of organic matter produced within the lake. This relationship results from the input of groundwater with high pCO(2) and with dissolved inorganic carbon depleted in C-13, which subsequently affects lake phytoplankton delta C-13 signatures. A rapid rise in lake level between ca. 11,000 and 9,500 cal yr BP coincided with stabilization of the dune field adjacent to the lake and expansion of vegetation around the lake, including white spruce. Organic delta C-13 values are relatively low and constant between about 10,000 and 6,000 cal yr BP, and then steadily increase until about 2,000 cal yr BP, suggesting a pattern of high followed by dropping lake levels generally consistent with results from core-transect studies. Higher-frequency fluctuations of 2-3 aEuro degrees in delta C-13 are common, and suggest variability in aspects of the lake-carbon cycle over multi-decadal timescales. Recent trends in groundwater and lake level, river discharge, and precipitation suggest an important role for wintertime precipitation in the regional groundwater system. The unusual hydrology of this system relative to most other lakes studied for paleoclimate in this region provides a novel insight into different seasonal aspects of Alaskan paleoclimatology. The record is consistent with a general long-term decrease in wintertime precipitation, possibly accompanied by an increase in permafrost extent, over the Holocene.

Playa-lake sedimentation and organic matter accumulation in an Andean piggyback basin: the recent record from the Cuenca de Pozuelos, North-west Argentina	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Expansive playa-lake systems situated in high-altitude piggyback basins are important and conspicuous components of both modern and ancient cordilleran orogenic systems. Extant playa lakes provide vital habitat for numerous endemic species, whereas sediments from these deposystems may record signals of climate change or develop natural resources over geological time. Laguna de los Pozuelos (North-west Argentina) provides the opportunity for an actualistic sedimentological and geochemical assessment of a piggyback basin playa lake in an area of critical interest for understanding Quaternary palaeoclimate dynamics. Silty clays and diatom ooze are the dominant playa-lake centre microfacies, with concentrations of total organic carbon and biogenic silica commonly exceeding 1.5 wt% in this sub-environment. Elemental and stable isotopic analyses point to a mixed organic matter composition in the playa-lake centre, with substantial contributions from algae and transported aquatic macrophytes. Bulk sediment and organic mass accumulation rates in the southern playa-lake centre approach 0.22 g cm(-2) year(-1) and 2.89 mg cm(-2) year(-1), respectively, indicating moderately rapid deposition with negligible deflation over historic time. Playa margin facies contain higher percentages of fragmented biogenic carbonate (ostracods and charophytes) and inorganically precipitated aragonite crusts due to seasonal pumping and evaporation of ground water. Organic matter accumulation is limited along these heavily bioturbated wet and dry mud flats. Fluviallacustrine transitional environments, which are key waterbird habitats, are either silty terminal splay (northern axis) or sandy deltas (southern axis) containing highly oxidized and partially allochthonous organic matter. Modern analogue data from Laguna de los Pozuelos provide key insights for: (i) environmental reconstructions of ancient lake sequences; and (ii) improving facies models for piggyback basins.

Coexistence of the native benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. and exotic dreissenid mussels in the New York Finger Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Populations of the benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. have sharply declined since the early 1990s in all North America's Great Lakes except Lake Superior. The onset and continued decline coincides with the invasion of these lakes by zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) mussels and the spread of quagga mussels to deep habitats. The six deepest Finger Lakes of central New York (Seneca, Cayuga, Skaneateles, Canandaigua, Keuka, and Owasco) have historically been Diporeia habitat and have had dreissenids for more than a decade. These lakes represent a wide range of trophic state, maximum depth, and dreissenid invasion history. We hypothesized that Diporeia abundance would be negatively impacted by dreissenid mussel expansion in the Finger Lakes. During 2006-2010, we sampled Diporeia and mussel populations in these six lakes. Diporeia was present in all six lakes, and was abundant (2000/m(2)) in Owasco Lake that has only zebra mussels and in Cayuga and Seneca Lakes that have had zebra and quagga mussels since 1994. Diporeia abundance was lowest (1000/m(2)) in Skaneateles, Canandaigua, and Keuka Lakes where quagga mussels have recently expanded. Productivity indicators explained much of the variability of Diporeia abundance. The persistence of Diporeia with quagga mussels in these lakes may be because of available alternative food resources. Fatty acid tracers indicate that Diporeia from Owasco Lake, the lake without quagga mussels, utilize diatoms, but Diporeia from Cayuga Lake that coexist with abundant quagga mussels also use food resources associated with terrestrial detritus that cannot be intercepted by dreissenids.

The glaciers, despite their cold and lifeless appearance, offer functioning habitats for life. The major objective of this study was to examine biogeochemical characteristics of miniecosystems present in cryoconite holes and to determine links to other components (soils, streams, and lakes) of the dry valley landscape. We examined cryoconite holes from 5 glaciers spanning the length of Taylor Valley, one of many valleys in the MCM. Cryoconite biotic communities were composed of the same species observed in streams and takes, namely, cyanobacteria (Chlorococcus, Chroococcus, Crinalium, Oscillatoria, Nostoc, and Sprirulina), rotifers (Philodina gregaria and Cephalodella catellina), tardigrades (Acutuncus antarcticus and Hypsibius spp.), and ciliates. Biotic communities did not reflect the composition of the immediately surrounding environments, suggesting the effects of eolian mixing and transport of sediments and biota across the valley. Gradients of chemistry and biotic abundance in cryoconite holes reflected the position of each glacier in the valley. Nitrogen and organic carbon concentration patterns across glaciers potentially resulted from biological activities in cryoconite holes. Properties of holes were stable from one to the next sampling season, suggesting that changes of cryoconite, hole properties develop on longer than yearly time scales.

J	Liger, E; Charlet, L; Van Cappellen, P				Liger, E; Charlet, L; Van Cappellen, P			Surface catalysis of uranium(VI) reduction by iron(II)	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Colloidal hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) is used as model solid to investigate the kinetic effect of specific adsorption interactions on the chemical reduction of uranyl ((UO22+)-O-VI) by ferrous iron. Acid-base titrations and Fe(II) and uranyl adsorption experiments are performed on hematite suspensions, under O-2- and CO2-free conditions. The results are explained in terms of a constant capacitance surface complexation model of the hematite-aqueous solution interface. Two distinct Fe(II) surface complexes are required to reproduce the data: (equivalent to (FeOFeII)-O-III)(+) (or equivalent to (FeOFeII)-O-III(OH2)(n)(+)) and equivalent to (FeOFeOH0)-O-III-O-II (or equivalent to (FeOFeII)-O-III(OH2)(n-1)OH0). The latter complex represents a significant fraction of total adsorbed Fe(II) at pH > 6.5. Uranyl binding to the hematite particles is characterized by a sharp adsorption edge between pH 4 and pH 5.5. Because of the absence of competing aqueous carbonate complexes, uranyl remains completely adsorbed at pH > 7. A single mononuclear surface complex accounts for the adsorption of uranyl over the entire range of experimental conditions. Although thermodynamically feasible, no reaction between uranyl and Fe(II) is observed in homogeneous solution at pH 7.5, for periods of up to three days. In hematite suspensions, however, surface-bound uranyl reacts on a time scale of hours. Based on Fourier Transformed Infrared spectra, chemical reduction of U(VI) is inferred to be the mechanism responsible for the disappearance of uranyl. The kinetics of uranyl reduction are quantified by measuring the decrease with time of the concentration of U(VI) extractable from the hematite particles by NaHCO3. In the presence of excess Fe(II), the initial rate of U(VI) reduction exhibits a first-order dependence on the concentration of adsorbed uranyl. The pseudo-first-order rate constant varies with pH (range, 6-7.5) and the total (dissolved + adsorbed) concentration of Fe(II) (range, 2-160 mu M) When analyzing the rate data in terms of the calculated surface speciation, the variability of the rate constant can be accounted for entirely by changes in the concentration of the Fe(II) monohydroxo surface complex equivalent to (FeOFeOH0)-O-III-O-II. Therefore, the following rate law is derived for the hematite-catalyzed reduction of uranyl by Fe(II), d[U(VI)]/dt = -k[equivalent to (FeOFeOH0)-O-III-O-II][U(VI)](ads) where the bimolecular rate constant k has a value of 399 +/- 25 M-1 min-l at 25 degrees C. The hydroxo surface complex is the rate-controlling reductant species, because it provides the most favorable coordination environment in which electrons are removed from Fe(II). Natural particulate matter collected in the hypolimnion of a seasonally stratified lake also causes the rapid reduction of uranyl by Fe(II). Ferrihydrite, identified in the particulate matter by X-ray diffraction, is one possible mineral phase accelerating the reaction between U(VI) and Fe(II). At near-neutral pH and total Fe(II) levels less than 1 mM, the pseudo-first-order rate constants of chemical U(VI) reduction, measured in the presence of the hematite and lake particles, are of the same order of magnitude as the highest corresponding rate coefficients for enzymatic U(VI) reduction in bacterial cultures. Hence, based on the results of this study, surface-catalyzed U(VI) reduction by Fe(II) is expected to be a major pathway of uranium immobilization in a wide range of redox-stratified environments.

J	Ehleringer, JR; Cerling, TE; Helliker, BR				Ehleringer, JR; Cerling, TE; Helliker, BR			C-4 photosynthesis, atmospheric CO2 and climate	OECOLOGIA												The objectives of this synthesis are (1) to review the factors that influence the ecological, geographical, and palaeoecological distributions of plants possessing C-4 photosynthesis and (2) to propose a hypothesis/model to explain both the distribution of C-4 plants with respect to temperature and CO2 and why C-4 photosynthesis is relatively uncommon in dicotyledonous plants (hereafter dicots), especially in comparison with its widespread distribution in monocotyledonous species (hereafter monocots). Our goal is to stimulate discussion of the factors controlling distributions of C-4 plants today, historically, and under future elevated CO2 environments. Understanding the distributions of C-3/C-4 plants impacts not only primary productivity, but also the distribution, evolution, and migration of both invertebrates and vertebrates that graze on these plants. Sixteen separate studies all indicate that the current distributions of C-4 monocots are tightly correlated with temperature: elevated temperatures during the growing season favor C-4 monocots. In contrast, the seven studies on C-4 dicot distributions suggest that a different environmental parameter, such as aridity (combination of temperature and evaporative potential), more closely describes their distributions. Differences in the temperature dependence of the quantum yield for CO2 uptake (light-use efficiency) of C-3 and C-4 species relate well to observed plant distributions and light-use efficiency is the only mechanism that has been proposed to explain distributional differences in C-3/C-4 monocots. Modeling of C-3 and C-4 light-use efficiencies under different combinations of atmospheric CO2 and temperature predicts that C-4-dominated ecosystems should not have expanded until atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached the lower levels that are thought to have existed beginning near the end of the Miocene. At that time, palaeocarbonate and fossil data indicate a simultaneous, global expansion of C-4-dominated grasslands. The C-4 monocots generally have a higher quantum yield than C-4 dicots and it is proposed that leaf venation patterns play a role in increasing the light-use efficiency of most C-4 monocots. The reduced quantum yield of most C-4 dicots is consistent with their rarity, and it is suggested that C-4 dicots may not have been selected until CO2 concentrations reached their lowest levels during glacial maxima in the Quaternary. Given the intrinsic light-use efficiency advantage of C-4 monocots, C-4 dicots may have been limited in their distributions to the warmest ecosystems, saline ecosystems, and/or to highly disturbed ecosystems. All C-4 plants have a significant advantage over C-3 plants under low atmospheric CO2 conditions and are predicted to have expanded significantly on a global scale during full-glacial periods, especially in tropical regions. Bog and lake sediment cores as well as pedogenic carbonates support the hypothesis that C-4 ecosystems were more extensive during the last glacial maximum and then decreased in abundance following deglaciation as atmospheric CO2 levels increased.					; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010	Cerling, Thure/0000-0002-3590-294X; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				NOV	1997	112	3					285	299		10.1007/s004420050311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050311								28307475					WOS:A1997YF42100001

To determine whether atmospheric nutrient inputs would increase phytoplankton growth and catchment dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flushing to constrain benthic algae, we analyzed NO3 (-) and PO (4) (-3) in atmospheric deposits; nutrients and DOC in runoff and lake water and standing crop biomass of phytoplankton and periphyton at Jaisamand Lake of Rajasthan, India. Atmospheric deposition of NO3 (-) (7.18-29.95 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and PO (4) (-3) (0.56-2.15 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) showed a consistently rising trend across the year. Microbial biomass and activity in catchment increased in response to atmospheric deposition. Lake DOC and nutrients showed strong coherence with their terrestrial and atmospheric fluxes. Phytoplankton development showed significant linearity with atmospheric input of nutrients. Air-driven input appeared to have compensated the nutrient constraints to phytoplankton during drought. The N:P stoichiometry of deposition and that of lake water indicated that, although there was a seasonal switchover to N- or P-limitation, phytoplankton were mainly co-limited by N and P due probably to the synergistic effects of combined N + P enrichment in the pelagic zone of the lake. Periphyton standing crop showed inverse relationship with phytoplankton and lake DOC. The study indicated that enhanced phytoplankton development and terrestrial DOC flushing in response to atmospheric nutrient input attenuated light penetration to constrain algal periphyton. We suggests that data on these issues may be considered in developing aquatic ecosystem models to establish future links between changing air-water-land interactions and associated shifts in lake ecosystem functioning for more accurately predicting climate change drivers and designing integrated lake basin management strategies.

V.			King rail (Rallus elegans) home range and microhabitat characteristics in western Lake Erie coastal marshes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The king rail (Rallus elegans) is a secretive marsh bird that is threatened or endangered in eight of nine states and provinces in the Laurentian Great Lakes (Great Lakes) region. Available survey data suggests that this species has undergone population declines across this region and these are believed to have been driven by habitat loss and degradation. An improved understanding of the amount and type of habitat king rails require during the breeding season at sites within the Great Lakes region would inform and improve progress toward conservation goals. During 2019-2021, we caught and radio-tagged 14 king rails in northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan within impounded coastal wetlands of western Lake Erie. We used radio telemetry to identify breeding season (May-August) home-range characteristics and third order habitat selection within home ranges (hereafter microhabitat). For the birds whose home range stabilized (N = 10), we found a mean home-range size of 8.8 ha (+/- 1.63 [SE]; range = 1.9 to 15.8). We generated a classification tree to determine which habitat characteristics were associated with king rail presence within home ranges in our study. We found that vegetative density within home ranges was particularly associated with king rail presence. Phragmites australis was also associated with king rail presence, despite its invasiveness and negative ecological impacts in the region, and could be selectively maintained to benefit king rails. Our results suggest that managers may be able to provide microhabitat for king rails by maintaining water depths of 6 to 17 cm and by promoting native, robust vegetation in the genera Carex and Juncus. Our findings could help inform wetland managers and conservation planners in the Great Lakes region, particularly in western Lake Erie coastal marshes, of patch sizes, water depths, plant communities, and vegetative structure preferred by king rails.

In this study, we combined isotopic, geochemical and hydrometric measurements to investigate hydrological characteristics and water quality changes during the interactions between surface water and groundwater in mountain river valley. Our results showed that the stable isotope values in most of the groundwater and river water samples were located above the middle of the local meteoric water line in a mountain river valley. The hydrochemical types of most of the groundwater and river water samples were Ca-Mg-HCO3 and were primarily dominated by rock weathering. The hydrochemical compositions of groundwater and river water were mainly affected by carbonate dissolution and cation exchange, but influences of saltwater intrusion and human activity were found at the lakeside. Precipitation was the main factor affecting the changes in hydrological processes at these groundwater and river water sites and they were also affected by meltwater, soil water and the interaction between groundwater and surface water. The water level of the river increased, and the recharge of the groundwater by river water increased in river valley during the rainy season, which led to an increase runoff path in groundwater. The interaction between the river water and groundwater was affected by the rainfall frequency and intensity, the recharge time of the soil water and the pressure of the river on both sides of the river channels. Additionally, our results indicated that the flow of groundwater into the river will lead to water quality deterioration. The increasing pressure of the river on the groundwater will cause the deterioration of groundwater quality, which will also be affected by saltwater intrusion and human activity. Our results detailed the hydrological characteristics, water quality changes and main influencing factors of the interaction between surface water and groundwater of river valley in mountain, which will be beneficial to promote the reasonable protection of water resources under climate change in the future.

The importance of time and space in biogeochemical heterogeneity and processing along the reservoir ecosystem continuum	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Globally significant quantities of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) enter freshwater reservoirs each year. These inputs can be buried in sediments, respired, taken up by organisms, emitted to the atmosphere, or exported downstream. While much is known about reservoir-scale biogeochemical processing, less is known about spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemistry within a reservoir along the continuum from inflowing streams to the dam. To address this gap, we examined longitudinal variability in surface water biogeochemistry (C, N, and P) in two small reservoirs throughout a thermally stratified season. We sampled total and dissolved fractions of C, N, and P, as well as chlorophyll-a from each reservoir's major inflows to the dam. We found that heterogeneity in biogeochemical concentrations was greater over time than space. However, dissolved nutrient and organic carbon concentrations had high site-to-site variability within both reservoirs, potentially as a result of shifting biological activity or environmental conditions. When considering spatially explicit processing, we found that certain locations within the reservoir, most often the stream-reservoir interface, acted as "hotspots" of change in biogeochemical concentrations. Our study suggests that spatially explicit metrics of biogeochemical processing could help constrain the role of reservoirs in C, N, and P cycles in the landscape. Ultimately, our results highlight that biogeochemical heterogeneity in small reservoirs may be more variable over time than space, and that some sites within reservoirs play critically important roles in whole-ecosystem biogeochemical processing.					; Woelmer, Whitney/JVO-2007-2024; Lewis, Abby/GLT-1176-2022	Lewis, Abigail/0000-0001-9933-4542; Wander, Heather/0000-0002-3762-6045													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2023	85	2							66	10.1007/s00027-023-00959-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-023-00959-7													WOS:000966123500001

This study was conducted from March to July 2021. The tracer data of delta H-2, delta O-18 (n=121), Rn-222 (n=522), Cl (n=151), TDS (n=155) in lake water, shallow groundwater (7-10 m), deep groundwater (25-40 m), and an improved single-well radon model were applied in 3 (A, B and C) typical areas (similar to 1 km(2)) of the Hongze lake. The results show that during the water transfer period (March to May) the rising lake level from normal water level (13 m asl) to the storage level (13.5 m asl), caused the exchange rate to increase from -6.3x10(-7) to 33.2x10(-7) m/s. All tracers in groundwater of A and C were continuously diluted by lake water, but shown a better mixing of the lake water, shallow and deep groundwater in area B with a water transfer channel/river (similar to-100 m(3)/s). In rainstorm season (June and July), the exchange rate changed from 3.4x10(-7) to -44.8x10(-7) m/s due to the high groundwater table (13-15 m asl) caused by flood and rainstorm. The rainstorm imposed the inflow of both shallow and deep groundwater into lake in river areas (A and B), but only shallow groundwater recharged lake in non-river area (C). Additionally, the exchange rate of the whole lake was estimated by the water balance equation, which varied between -1011 and 458 m(3)/s with an average of -26 m(3)/s. Finally, a conceptual model of exchange rate among lake, shallow and deep groundwater under spatio-temporal heterogeneity is proposed. The findings offer better understanding of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of lake-groundwater interaction and the effects on lake water balance and recharge systems.					xiong, ling/JQI-1433-2023; LI, Kai/JYO-4263-2024	Chen, Xuegao/0000-0001-8396-1605; Xiong, Ling/0000-0003-3724-5493													0885-6087	1099-1085				APR	2023	37	4							e14867	10.1002/hyp.14867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14867													WOS:001143701600001
J	Abera, B				Abera, Bayeh			The epidemiology of Schistosoma mansoni in the Lake Tana Basin (Ethiopia): Review with retrospective data analyses	HELIYON												Schistosoma mansoni is one of the major waterborne diseases grouped underwater based Neglected Tropical Diseases in Africa. In Ethiopia, the Lake Tana Basin has favorable environment (temperature and water) for S. mansoni transmission. The prevalence of S. mansoni varies among regions based on environmental conditions and human water contact. Therefore, this review was conducted to identify hot spots districts and determine the prevailing S. mansoni prevalence in the Lake Tana Basin. Research articles published in English in the last 65 years were searched from Google scholar, PubMed, and Web of science. In addition, four-year S. mansoni data that were reported in health care facilities were extracted from health management information system in 61 districts of the Lake Tana Basin. In total, 43 research articles on S. mansoni that met the inclusion criteria and were published between 1957 and 2022. Over 98% of the articles were crosssectional studies, while five articles addressed malacological studies. Among 61 districts, 19 (31%) were identified as hotspot districts for S. mansoni infection in the Lake Tana Basin. S. mansoni prevalence and the abundance of its host snail showed spatial and seasonal variations. On average 2000 school children/year attended health care facilities for S. mansoni infection. Swimming habits [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.2, p = 0.030], irrigation practice (AOR = 3:09, p <= 0.001), fishing (AOR = 2:43, p = 0.005) and being male (AOR = 1.74, p = 0.002) were risk factors for contributing to S. mansoni infection. This study showed the spatial and seasonal variations of S. mansoni prevalence and its endemicity in the hottest lowland areas of the Lake Tana Basin. The research articles on S. mansoni had poor geographical coverage. Malacological studies on water bodies, assessments on knowledge and attitude in the community towards S. mansoni transmission are areas of future studies.

The results showed that the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of SPM obviously changed with water levels. In the flowing period, the SPM showed the most negative delta C-13 (-35.4 to -30.8 parts per thousand), delta N-15 (+4.2 to +7.6 parts per thousand) and C/N > 8, suggesting that SPM in the period was mainly derived from C-13-depleted land C-3 plants. The highest delta C-13 and C/N ratios of SPM appeared in the flooding period because the lake and river were connected and the soil organic matter and the river-derived SPM were input to the lake. In the lowering period, the relatively lower delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of SPM were almost consistent with those of the decayed aquatic plants, meaning that aquatic plants were the main components of the SPM. In the lentic period, the delta C-13 and C/N ratios of SPM were similar to those of SOM due to the re-suspended SOM in the shallow lake. The SOM in the lentic period (delta C-13: -30.4 to -25.5 parts per thousand) mainly came from the decline of aquatic plants. With water level rising, the delta C-13 of SOM turned to be higher (-26.1 to 24.3 parts per thousand), while the C/N ratios changed small. It may be the result of that fast water flow scoured and suspended the surface of sediment. The delta C-13 and C/N ratios of aquatic plants changed obviously with water levels, which was mainly due to the seasonal variation of photosynthesis and respiration. The delta N-15 values of aquatic plants were dependent on that of water-soluble N at different water levels. These results indicated that the sources of the organic matter in the lake were obviously influenced by the water levels.

How metazooplankters, especially copepods, regulate ciliate community structure in shallow eutrophic waters is not completely clear. We carried out mesocosm experiments with different cyclopoid copepod enrichments in a shallow eutrophic lake to examine the responses of ciliate community structure and abundance to changes in cyclopoid copepod biomass and to detect any cascading effects on bacterioplankton and edible phytoplankton. Our results indicate that an increase in copepod zooplankton biomass favours the development of small-sized bacterivorous ciliates. This effect is unleashed by the decline of predaceous ciliate abundance, which would otherwise graze effectively on the small-sized ciliates. The inverse relationship between crustacean zooplankton and large predaceous ciliates is an important feature adjusting not only the structure of the ciliate community but also the energy transfer between meta- and protozooplankton. Still we could not detect any cascading effects on bacterio- or phytoplankton that would be caused by the structural changes in the ciliate community. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Using these techniques, we collected a new species of gordiid as cysts in aquatic snails (Biomphalaria pfeifferi) from the Lake Victoria Basin, western Kenya, Africa and cultured them in the laboratory. We describe the adult free-living male and female worms using morphological (light and scanning electron microscopy) and molecular data as well as the life cycle, mating and oviposition behavior, egg strings, eggs, larvae, and cysts of this new species. Chordodes kenyaensis n. sp. belongs to a large group of African Chordodes in which simple areoles are smooth or superficially structured less so than "blackberry" areoles but contain filamentous projections. Present among the simple areoles are clusters of bulging areoles, crowned and circumcluster areoles along with thorn and tubercle areoles. In the laboratory, worms developed and emerged within 53-78 days from three species of laboratory-reared crickets exposed to cysts of this species. Adult male and female C. kenyaensis n. sp. initiated typical Gordian knots within hours to days of being placed together and males deposited masses of sperm on the cloacal region of females. Females began oviposition within a week of copulating and attached egg strings in a continuous zigzag pattern on small branches or air-hoses but never free in the water column. Larvae hatched within two to three weeks, and cysts developed in laboratory-reared and exposed snails within 14-24 days. Morphological characteristics of egg strings, eggs, larvae and cysts of C. kenyaensis were most similar to other gordiids in the genus Chordodes but differed morphologically from other gordiid genera for which similar information is available.					; Hanelt, Ben/JNR-9325-2023	Hanelt, Ben/0000-0001-9298-7356; 													1175-5326	1175-5334				SEP 26	2013	3717	1					23	38											26176092					WOS:000324801900002

Floating leaf blades of the three plant species were tagged and numbered within established replicate plots and the leaf length, percentages and types of damage and decay of all tagged leaves were recorded weekly during the growing season. Microbial decay, infection by phytopathogenic fungi (Colletotrichum nymphaeae) and oomycetes (Pythium sp.), consumption by pond snails, and mechanical factors were the most important causes of leaf damage. Several types of succession comprising different causes of damage were distinguished during the season. For example, young floating leaves are affected by more or less specialized invertebrate species consuming leaf tissue, followed by non-specialized invertebrate species feeding on the damaged floating leaves. In the two investigated hardwater lakes the seasonal patterns of initial decomposition differed between Nymphaea and Nuphar.					van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011; Klok, Peter/AAF-7393-2019														2167-8359					JUN 21	2019	7								e7158	10.7717/peerj.7158	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7158								31275754					WOS:000472466000012

This study investigates seasonal variations of sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics and their relationship with ARGs in three urban reservoirs in Nanjing, China: Pingshan Forest Park, Shanhu Lake Wetland Park, and Zhaoqiao Reservoir. Sampling was conducted in May and September 2023 to assess water quality, antibiotic concentrations, and ARG abundance. A total of 30 water samples were analyzed in regard to their physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and antibiotics. A quantitative PCR assay was used to measure the ARG abundance relative to the 16S rRNA gene. Sulfonamide concentrations ranged from 30 to 120 ng/L, while the concentrations of tetracyclines were 50-160 ng/L. Notably, sulfamethazine decreased significantly in two reservoirs (Shanhu and Zhaoqiao, p < 0.05), while other antibiotics showed minimal variation, indicating persistent contamination from agricultural runoff and wastewater discharge. ARG abundance was lower in May than in September, with sulfonamide resistance genes being lower cumulatively than tetracycline resistance genes. Strong correlations (r > 0.7) were observed between ARGs and parameters like dissolved oxygen and pH. High antibiotic levels were observed in areas without nearby hospitals or pharmaceutical companies, implicating agriculture as a major pollution source. By analyzing sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics and their resistance genes across three eutrophic reservoirs in Nanjing, China, we highlight critical environmental drivers of ARG proliferation and propose targeted mitigation strategies.

J	Zhang, Q; Jin, X; Li, SM				Zhang, Qi; Jin, Xin; Li, Simin			Heavy metal pollution in slow-moving river: highlight the high risks posed by suspended particulate matter	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												The heavy metal risks posed by suspended particulate matter (SPM) in fluvial system have long been ignored. In this paper, we characterized the heavy metal pollution within SPM sampled from a typical slow-moving river-Ziya River Mainstream (ZRM). The concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb were determined by ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Measurements indicated that all seven heavy metal contents in SPM were higher than their contents in sediments and those from rivers and lakes elsewhere in China (except for Cd and Pb). Indices and multivariate statistics were calculated to identify sources, assess ecological risks, and to highlight the role of SPM in heavy metal transport. We found that industrial discharges were the dominant sources of heavy metals within SPM. Cd likely posed a higher risk than other heavy metals. Higher heavy metal risk within SPM was found in S5, S12, and S13, suggesting that more attention needs to be focused on these sites to protect the fluvial system. We found that the properties of SPM strongly impact the Cu, Pb, and Zn transport. Given that special characteristics and motion behavior of SPM in ZRM and higher risks of heavy metals posed by SPM than sediment, we deemed that conducting source identification and risk assessment of heavy metals in SPM in slow-moving rivers may be more accurate and reasonable.					jin, xin/KWU-0198-2024														1532-0383	1549-7887				NOV 16	2020	29	8					914	928		10.1080/15320383.2020.1783509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2020.1783509		JUN 2020											WOS:000547266900001

Nutrient excretion by crustacean zooplankton in the deep chlorophyll layer of Lake Superior	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We hypothesized that the resident and migrating cold-water zooplankton in Lake Superior concentrate beneath the thermocline and elevate nutrient availability via mineralization in the deep chlorophyll layer (DCL). In August 2010 and 2011, diel vertical net tows and incubation experiments were conducted in the western arm of Lake Superior to measure zooplankton distribution and excretion of dissolved nutrients. Limnocalanus macrurus showed the strongest spatial overlap with the DCL, and the broader crustacean community excreted P at 0.145 mu g.mg(-1).h(-1) and N at 0.617 mu g.mg(-1).h(-1) as soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonia, respectively. Mysis diluviana displayed strong diel vertical migration into the DCL and excreted P at 0.013 mu g.mg(-1).h(-1) and N at 0.116 mu g.mg(-1).h(-1) as SRP and ammonia, respectively. Based on primary productivity estimates, the zooplankton community has the potential to meet the daily phosphorus demand by phytoplankton in the DCL during late-season stratification. Our excretion estimates indicate a possible coupling between the cold-water zooplankton community and production in the DCL of Lake Superior.					; Hrabik, Thomas/GYA-2566-2022	Oliver, Samantha/0000-0001-5668-1165; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2015	72	3					390	399		10.1139/cjfas-2014-0209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0209													WOS:000351773700006

Changing nitrogen deposition with low δ15N-NH4+ and δ15N-NO3- values at the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, Canada	FACETS												Ammonium deposition at the International Institute for Sustainable Development Experimental Lakes Area (IISD-ELA), in northwestern Ontario, Canada, has doubled in the last 45 years and thus is no longer among the low nitrogen (N) deposition sites in North America. This may be related to the concurrent intensification of Manitoba agriculture to the west and upwind of the ELA. Large increases in ammonium deposition at the ELA were important in driving the observed trend and increased the NH4+ to NO3- ratio of input to aquatic and terrestrial systems. Stable isotope analyses of two years of bulk (wet and dry) atmospheric deposition revealed very large ranges in delta N-15-NH4+ (22% range), delta N-15-NO3-(18%), and delta O-18-NO3- (19%). Few other delta N-15-NH4+, delta N-15-NO3-, and delta O-18-NO3- values have been published for Canadian precipitation. Increases in delta N-15 of NH4+ and NO3- in July occurred with increases in total N deposition. The wide range and seasonal trends of delta N-15 and delta O-18 values in ELA precipitation mean that studies characterizing N inputs to watersheds and lakes require an ongoing and comprehensive annual sampling regime. Global trends of declining delta N-15 of N deposition evident in lake sediment records may be a result of increases in NH4+ deposition with lower delta N-15-NH4+ values. Similarly, the relationship in Lake Superior between increasing NO3- and lower delta N-15-NO3- values may be explained by increased atmospheric deposition of N with low delta N-15 values.

Understanding the seasonal changes in NOM composition and their reactivity in DBP formation could lead to a better treatment of drinking water and a more consistent water quality. NOM from the Terkos Lake was fractionated and characterized by XAD resin adsorption and ultrafiltration (UF) techniques during four different seasons within a year. XAD fraction analysis indicates that the HPI (38%) and the TPI (21%) were the dominant chemical fractions as DOC masses across the sampling period. Moreover, the fractions contributing to the most UV254 absorbance were HPO, which accounted for more than 72% of total UV254. It was found that the percentages of UV254 of HPI and TPI showed significant amount of variation with coefficients of variation of 48% (HPI) and 35% (TPI), respectively. Moreover, it was concluded that the HPO fraction was the primary THM precursor, which contributed more than 48%, and while the primary fraction of HAA precursors was found to be TPI, accounting for more than 47% of total HAAFP with exceptions in January 2011. As obviously seen in this study, the hydrophobic constituents in Terkos Lake water are on the low end of the spectrum in terms of their reactivity to form HAAs. In the context of THM reactivity, the physical properties (i.e., moleculer size) of Terkos Lake NOM are more important than their chemical properties (i.e., aromaticity). On the other hand, the predominant fraction as the source of HAAs precursors was found to be with the TPI and HPI chemical fractions.

In contrast, these anomalies appear to be either absent, or less well-defined, in high-latitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Here, we inferred environmental changes during the past two millennia from proxies in a sediment core from Mago Ike, an East Antarctic lake in Skarvsnes (Lutzow Holm Bay). Variations in lake primary production were inferred from fossil pigments, sedimentological and geochemical proxies and combined with absolute diatom counts to infer past diatom productivity and community changes. Three distinct stratigraphic zones were recognized, resulting from a shift from marine to lacustrine conditions with a clear transition zone in between. The presence of open-watermarine diatoms indicates a coastal zone seasonally free of sea ice between c. 2120-1500 cal yr BP. Subsequently, the lake became isolated from the ocean due to isostatic uplift. Freshwater conditions were established from c. 1120 cal yr BP onwards after which the proxies are considered highly sensitive to temperature changes. There is no evidence for a Medieval Climate Anomaly, Little Ice Age or twentieth century warming in our lake sediment record suggesting that studies that have imposed Northern Hemisphere climate anomalies onto Southern Hemisphere palaeoclimate records should be treated with caution.					; De Batist, Marc/F-5722-2012	Roberts, Stephen/0000-0003-3407-9127; Heirman, Katrien/0000-0001-6832-8385; De Batist, Marc/0000-0002-1625-2080													0954-1020	1365-2079				OCT	2014	26	5					585	598		10.1017/S0954102014000029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102014000029													WOS:000344735300014

A full understanding of these systems must include the role of groundwater, but this is poorly understood, especially for high-elevation lakes. This study addresses the role of groundwater in an alpine watershed, located at the continental divide of North America, with a focus on quantifying the groundwater exchange with Lake O'Hara in British Columbia, Canada. This is facilitated using a water balance approach and measurements of electrical conductivity in inflowing streams. The water balance indicates that groundwater inflow is substantial, as it was equivalent to at least 30 - 67% and 35 - 74% of the total outflow for the 2004 and 2005 field seasons, respectively. Hydrological and chemical data also suggest contributions from both deep and shallow groundwater flow paths.					; Hayashi, Masaki/E-2600-2012	Roy, James/0000-0002-1804-2917; Hayashi, Masaki/0000-0003-4890-3113													0094-8276					JUL 8	2006	33	13							L13405	10.1029/2006GL026611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006GL026611													WOS:000238952400006
J	Coe, MT; Birkett, CM				Coe, MT; Birkett, CM			Calculation of river discharge and prediction of lake height from satellite radar altimetry: Example for the Lake Chad basin - art. no. W10205	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The application of satellite radar altimetry to the determination of lake and river elevations has been used in numerous projects, and is well validated. Here we show that with the aid of ground-based information, this technique can be extended to determine river discharge and predict downstream lake and marsh height. The Lake Chad basin provides an ideal case study due to its well-known hydrology and complex lake and marsh morphology and because prediction of lake and marsh height has been identified as potentially useful to people living in the region. Altimetric stage measurements from the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite, at the Chari/Ouham confluence, estimate river discharge about 500 km downstream at N'Djamena 10 days in advance (r(2) = 0.9562). Via simple linear correlation methods, the stage measurements successfully estimate the height of the permanent waters of the lake (600 km downstream) 39 days in advance (r(2) = 0.9297). Predicting the water height on the western marshes of the lake bed is poorer (r(2) = 0.7958) due to a change in response time of the local stage to the seasonal floods coincident with an observed increase in mean water level in the latter half of the 1990s. Before 1997 a 96-day phase lag results in the best fit (r(2) = 0.6463). After 1997 the best fit is obtained with a 66-day phase lag (r(2) = 0.8139). The excellent river discharge and lake height predictions show that altimetry is a useful tool where ground-based data are difficult to obtain and where rapid water resource assessment is desirable.

J	Kebede, S; Admasu, G; Travi, Y				Kebede, Seifu; Admasu, Girum; Travi, Yves			Estimating ungauged catchment flows from Lake Tana floodplains, Ethiopia: an isotope hydrological approach	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												The isotope balance approach, which used 18O content of waters, has been used as an independent tool to estimate inflow to Lake Tana of surface water flows from ungauged catchment of Lake Tana (50% of the total area) and evaporative water loss in the vast plains adjoining the lake. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted to investigate the effects of changes in the input parameters on the estimated flux. Surface water inflow from ungauged catchment is determined to be in the order of 1.698x109m3a-1. Unaccounted water loss from the lake has been estimated at 454x106m3a-1 (equivalent to 5% of the total via surface water). Since the lake is water tight to groundwater outflow, the major error introduced into the water balance computation is related to evaporative water loss in water from the flood plains. If drained, the water which is lost to evaporation can be used as an additional water resource for socio-economic development in the region (tourism, agriculture, hydropower, and navigation). Hydrological processes taking place in the vast flood plains of Lake Tana (origin of salinity, groundwater surface water interaction, origin of flood plain waters) have been investigated using isotopes of water and geochemistry as tracers. The salinity of shallow groundwaters in the flood plains is related to dissolution of salts accumulated in sediments covering former evaporation pools and migration of trace salt during recharge. The waters in the flood plains originate from local rainfall and river overflows and the effect of backwater flow from the lake is excluded. Minimum linkage exists between the surface waters in the flood plains and shallow groundwaters in alluvio lacustrine sediments suggesting the disappearance of flood waters following the rainy season, which is related to complete evaporation or drainage than seepage to the subsurface. There is no groundwater outflow from the lake. Inflow of groundwater cannot be ruled out. Discharge of groundwater to the lake is presumed to take place along rocky bottom in southern sector from Quaternary volcanics covering the southern sector of the catchment.

Modelling water-level options for ecosystem services and assessment of climate change: Loktak Lake, northeast India	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Water levels within Loktak Lake, an internationally important wetland, are regulated to prioritize hydropower over other ecosystem services. High water levels have impacted ecological conditions, in particular floating vegetated islands. Barrage operation options prioritizing hydropower, agriculture and the lake ecosystem are developed using a lake water balance model. Current hydropower abstractions can be maintained without ecologically damaging high water levels. Enhanced agricultural abstractions reduce levels to meet ecological requirements. The latter could be satisfied without compromising current hydropower and agricultural abstractions. An integrated option shows it is largely possible to balance hydropower and agricultural abstractions with wetland water-level requirements. Sustainability of barrage operation options is assessed under climate change scenarios. Higher monsoon precipitation and river flow can be accommodated. Larger dry-season drawdowns impact most barrage operation options, especially the integrated option. Results demonstrate the requirement to consider current and potential future climatic conditions when developing wetland water-level management plans.

J	Chen, MF; Deng, JY; Fan, SY; Li, YT				Chen Mofei; Deng Jinyun; Fan Shaoying; Li Yitian			Applying energy theory to understand the relationship between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												The complex relationship between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake controls the exchange of water and sediment between the two, and exerts effects on water resources, flooding, shipping, and the ecological environment. The theory of energy is applied in this paper to investigate the physical mechanisms that determine the nature of the contact between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake and to establish an energy difference (F (e) ) index to quantify the interactions between the two systems. Data show that F (e) values for this interaction have increased since the 1950s, indicating a weakening in the river effect while the lake effect has been enhanced. Enclosure of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has also significantly influenced the relationship between the river and the lake by further reducing the impacts of the Yangtze River. The river effect also increases slightly during the dry season, and decreases significantly at the end of the flooding period, while interactions between the two to some extent influence the development of droughts and floods within the lake area. Data show that when the flow of the five rivers within this area is significant and a blocking effect due to the Yangtze River is also clearly apparent, floods occur easily; in contrast, when the opposite is true and the flow of the five rivers is small, and the Yangtze River can accommodate the flow, droughts occur frequently. Construction and enclosure of the TGR also means that the lake area is prone to droughts during September and October.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				AUG	2018	28	8					1059	1071		10.1007/s11442-018-1541-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-018-1541-6													WOS:000440115800002

Estimation of the width of the nearshore zone in Lake Michigan using eleven years of MODIS satellite imagery	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The nearshore zone, that region of water directly influenced by its proximity to the coast, has received increasing attention in recent years. The extent of the nearshore zone has been defined by some constant descriptive feature: e.g., a specific depth or a particular distance offshore. This type of definition does not allow for the dynamic nature of the relationship between the land and water and how it may be influenced by local, seasonal, or transient effects. Here satellite observations examined evaluate how the width of the nearshore zone in Lake Michigan varies with position along the coastline and with time. Satellite-derived estimates of chlorophyll concentration along seventy-one shore-normal transects spaced approximately 10 km apart around the lake were used to determine the width of the nearshore zone, defined as the point at which the estimated chlorophyll concentration close to the shore approaches the more-uniform offshore concentration. Of a total of 23,807 transects extracted from MODIS observations made between 2003 and 2013, we successfully fit a bi-linear model relating chlorophyll concentration to distance offshore to 15,996. We found that the width of the nearshore zone is variable, both seasonally and spatially. Although the overall median width of 45 km (mean width 53 km) closely corresponds to the 5 km value used in a number of Great Lakes studies including Lake Michigan, 10% of the estimates are >8.9 km, likely representing times of enhanced mixing and transport of nearshore waters into the offshore.

These valuable effects originate from omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the fish oil. In this study, fatty acid composition of the muscle lipids of Salmo trutta macrostigma (wild brown trout) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (cultured rainbow trout) in Gezende Dam Lake were determined by gas chromatographic technique. In both species, palmitic acid (16.26-18.94%), oleic acid (17.88-20.49%) and DHA (14.08-18.49%) were identified as major saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), respectively. Wild fish contained significantly more linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, total omega 3 fatty acids and has higher omega 3/omega 6 ratio than cultured fish.

L.; Moulatlet, Gabriel M.; de Oliveira Cordeiro, Carlos Leandro; Ferreira Rodrigues, Erika do Socorro			Late Holocene tectonic influence on hydrology and vegetation patterns in a northern Amazonian megafan	CATENA												The factors that control the heterogeneous canopy of the Amazonian rainforest have long been a topic of interest for research. Among all hypotheses, changes in landscape due to geological processes have been increasingly defended. Large areas of open vegetation in the northern Amazonian lowlands are confined to paleolandforms created by the abandoning of megafan depositional systems. Previous investigations related the megafan sedimentation in this region to Late Pleistocene-Holocene tectonic reactivations. However, the influence of neotectonics on both the Amazonian megafans and associated vegetation cover remains to be further investigated. We studied a depression preliminarily noticed in the south-central sector of one Amazonian megafan (i.e., Virua megafan) aiming to determine if its genesis was due to recent tectonic subsidence after the megafan abandoning. The investigation combined morphostructural, hydrological and remote sensing reflectance analyses, as well as characterization of floristic communities in the modern and ancient environments based respectively on field inventories and palynological data. The results indicated a neatly 10-km long and rectangular-shaped area having straight margins paralleling NNE/SSW-trending regional structural lineaments. Hydrological analysis suggests that this area experiences the largest floods during wet seasons, a condition compatible with the topographic data that revealed a smoother gradient of similar to 3 m comparing this area with others from the megafan plain. In the studied depression, numerous forest patches are arranged as sets of parallel straight lines trending consistently in the NE/SW direction. The patches have spectral values that differ significantly from other forest patches over the megafan surface, being compared to those of seazonally-flooded forests, such as igapos and varzeas, that surround the megafan paleolandform. In addition, a forest patch within the depression revealed trees physiologically adapted to tolerate submersion 6 to 7 months per year, which is also a characteristic of the inundated forests external to the megafan. These data altogether led us to conclude that the studied depression consists of a shallow subsiding basin formed by tectonic reactivations in the mid/late Holocene. Tectonic instability at around 2 cal kyr BP further disturbed this system by creating NE/SW-trending lakes and leading to the replacement of seazonally-flooded forests by grasslands. Thus, tectonic activity in a relatively recent geological time must be accounted when analyzing plant distribution in the Amazonian wetlands.

Nile perch distribution in south-east Lake Victoria is more strongly driven by abiotic factors, than by prey densities	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied the effects of environmental driving factors (maximum depth, visibility, oxygen, temperature, and prey densities) on the distribution and diet composition of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) in south-east Lake Victoria from 2009 to 2011. We tested the hypotheses that (i) Nile perch distribution is regulated by the same environmental factors on a local scale (Mwanza Gulf) and on a regional scale (Mwanza Gulf, Speke Gulf and the open lake in Sengerema district), and (ii) driving factors act differently on different Nile perch size classes. Fish were sampled with gillnets. Nile perch densities were highest in the shallow part of the Mwanza Gulf and during the wet seasons, mainly caused by high densities of juveniles. The environmental driving factors explained Nile perch distributions on both regional and local scales in a similar way, often showing non-linear relationships. Maximum depth and temperature were the best predictors of Nile perch densities. Prey densities of shrimp and haplochromines did not strongly affect Nile perch distributions, but did explain Nile perch diet on a local and regional scale. We conclude that abiotic variables drive Nile perch distributions more strongly than prey densities and that feeding takes place opportunistically.					van Zwieten, Paul A.M./C-4759-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; van Zwieten, P.A.M./C-4759-2008; Nagelkerke, Leopold/C-4758-2008	van Zwieten, Paul A.M./0000-0003-2627-2373; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; Nagelkerke, Leopold/0000-0003-1130-749X													0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2015	755	1					239	255		10.1007/s10750-015-2237-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2237-x													WOS:000356039300017
J	Baumgärtner, D; Mörtl, M; Rothhaupt, KO				Baumgaertner, Daniel; Moertl, Martin; Rothhaupt, Karl-Otto			Effects of water-depth and water-level fluctuations on the macroinvertebrate community structure in the littoral zone of Lake Constance	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In a 2-year field study, abundance, biomass and community structure of benthic macroinvertebrates and their seasonal dynamics were assessed along the depth gradient in the stony littoral zone of Lake Constance, Central Europe. The macroinvertebrate community patterns differed significantly between the depth zones, partly because of species turnover, but mostly as a result of different dominance structures. These distinct differences should be considered when designing surveys of benthic invertebrates also for applied purposes, since sources of variation should be kept small and particularly on hard substrates, extensive efforts are required to obtain sufficient data for a powerful statistical analysis. A large seasonal variability in the macroinvertebrate communities of the eulittoral zone indicates a strong influence of physical disturbances, particularly of water-level fluctuations. The community pattern of the drift line samples was influenced by the previous development of the water level. The cumulated water-level fluctuations and their net tendency accounted for three quarters of the variation in a PCA. Since Lake Constance is the only large pre-alpine lake whose water level is not extensively regulated, the uniqueness of the littoral community should have implications for nature conservation measures.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2008	613						97	107		10.1007/s10750-008-9475-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9475-0													WOS:000258401000010

Influences of potential evapotranspiration estimation methods on SWAT's hydrologic simulation in a northwestern Minnesota watershed	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a widely used watershed hydrology and water quality model, provides three different methods (Hargreaves, Priestley-Taylor, and Penman-Monteith) for estimating potential evapotranspiration (PET) and the corresponding actual evapotranspiration (AET). Although these methods have been extensively tested, the effects of using them within SWAT's framework are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to test the three PET methods within SWAT's framework using data collected in the Wild Rice River watershed, located in northwestern Minnesota. The performance of the SWAT models was measured using three statistics: the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E-j(2)), coefficient of determination (R-2), and performance virtue (PVk). The three models were independently calibrated and validated using the observed daily stream flows at two USGS gauging stations. The simulated stream discharges were compared with the corresponding observed values and the estimated evapotranspiration examined in accordance with the wet-environment areal evapotranspiration (E-TW) derived from the evaporation data for Williams Lake, located about 100 km southeast of the study watershed. The use of the three PET methods resulted in different values for two calibration parameters, namely the soil evaporation compensation factor and SCS curve number At the lower station, which is near the watershed outlet, the observed annual mean discharge (8.33 m(3)/s) during the model validation period was predicted to be 10.25, 10.87, and 9.69 m(3)/s by SWAT-Penman, SWAT-Priestley, and SWAT Hargreaves, respectively. The annual mean discharge (10.83 m(3)/s) was more accurately predicted during the model calibration period, with an absolute error of less than 0.5 m(3)/s. The prediction errors for the upper station were comparable with those for the lower station. In addition, all three models exhibited good performance when simulating the monthly, seasonal, and annual mean discharges (E-j(2) > 0.75 and PVk > 0.80) and satisfactory performance when predicting the daily stream flows (E-j(2) > 0.36 and PVk > 0.70). In estimating evapotranspiration for the study watershed, SWAT-Hargreaves seemed to be slightly superior to the other two models, while SWAT-Priestley might be more appropriate for an E-TW value greater than 8.0 mm/d. Nevertheless, the AET values estimated by the three models shared a concurrent spatial pattern and temporal trend, and were insignificantly different from each other at a 5% significance level (p-values > 0.05). The results indicated that after calibration, using the three ET methods within SWAT produced very similar hydrologic (AET and discharge) predictions for the study watershed.

Biogeochemical and microbial seasonal dynamics between water column and sediment processes in a productive mountain lake: Georgetown Lake, MT, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												This manuscript details investigations of a productive, mountain freshwater lake and examines the dynamic relationship between the chemical and stable isotopes and microbial composition of lake bed sediments with the geochemistry of the lake water column. A multidisciplinary approach was used in order to better understand the lake water- sediment interactions including quantification and sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA genes in a sediment core as well as stable isotope analysis of C, S, and N. One visit included the use of a pore water sampler to gain insight into the composition of dissolved solutes within the sediment matrix. Sediment cores showed a general decrease in total C with depth which included a decrease in the fraction of organic C combined with an increase in the fraction of inorganic C. One sediment core showed a maximum concentration of dissolved organic C, dissolved inorganic C, and dissolved methane in pore water at 4 cm depth which corresponded with a sharp increase in the abundance of 16S rRNA templates as a proxy for the microbial population size as well as the peak abundance of a sequence affiliated with a putative methanotroph. The isotopic separation between dissolved inorganic and dissolved organic carbon is consistent with largely aerobic microbial processes dominating the upper water column, while anaerobic microbial activity dominates the sediment bed. Using sediment core carbon concentrations, predictions were made regarding the breakdown and return of stored carbon per year from this temperate climate lake with as much as 1.3 Gg C yr(-1) being released in the form of CO2 and CH4.

However, most existing deep learning models have overlooked the physical relationship between DO and other parameters during simulation, leading to simulated values that deviate from the actual physical laws. Moreover, the inherent opacity of deep learning models restricts their applicability. Here, we propose the prior knowledge-constrained bidirectional long shortterm memory network (PKBiLSTM) model to simulate DO levels in the Dianchi Lake basin. Our results show that the PKBiLSTM model achieves an average Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE) of 0.926, which represents a 3.35% and 2.38% increase compared to the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and categorical boosting (CatBoost) models, respectively. The experiments reveal that pH has the greatest effect on DO concentration within the range of 6.5-10. Furthermore, the primary factors affecting DO exhibit seasonal differences. The findings underscore the potential of our method to enhance the scientific management of watersheds.

This study revealed rDNA-based abundances strongly affected the relative activities of microbial taxa within Microcystis aggregates, as well as trade-off effects between microbial abundances and activities. Cyanobacterial aggregates (CAs) comprised of photosynthetic and phycospheric microorganisms are often the cause of cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic freshwater lakes. Although phylogenetic diversity in CAs has been extensively studied, much less was understood about the activity status of microorganisms inside CAs and determinants of their activities. In this study, the 16S rRNA gene (rDNA)-based total communities within CAs in Lake Taihu of China were analyzed over a period of 6 months during the bloom season; the 16S rRNA-based active communities during daytime, nighttime, and under anoxic conditions were also profiled. Synchronous turnover of both cyanobacterial and phycospheric communities was observed, suggesting the presence of close interactions. The rRNA/rDNA ratio-based relative activities of individual taxa were predominantly determined by their rDNA-based relative abundances. In particular, high-abundance taxa demonstrated comparatively lower activities, whereas low-abundance taxa were generally more active. In comparison, hydrophysicochemical factors as well as diurnal and redox conditions showed much less impact on relative activities of microbial taxa within CAs. Nonetheless, total and active communities exhibited differences in community assembly processes, the former of which were almost exclusively controlled by homogeneous selection during daytime and under anoxia. Taken together, the results from this study provide novel insights into the relationships among microbial activities, community structure, and environmental conditions and highlight the importance of further exploring the regulatory mechanisms of microbial activities at the community level.IMPORTANCE Cyanobacterial aggregates are important mediators of biogeochemical cycles in eutrophic lakes during cyanobacterial blooms, yet regulators of microbial activities within them are not well understood. This study revealed rDNA-based abundances strongly affected the relative activities of microbial taxa within Microcystis aggregates, as well as trade-off effects between microbial abundances and activities. Environmental conditions further improved the levels of relative activities and affected community assembly mechanisms in phycospheric communities.

J	Khosravi, R; Zarei, M; Sracek, O				Khosravi, Roghayeh; Zarei, Mehdi; Sracek, Ondra			Hydraulic and geochemical interactions between surface water and sediment pore water in seasonal hypersaline Maharlu Lake, Iran	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Study of interactions between surface-water and pore-water in lakes is complicated due to spatio-temporal heterogeneities in flow condition across the sediment-water interface. In this study, seasonal hypersaline Maharlu Lake was investigated by collecting surface-water and pore-water samples from four nests of multilevel piezometers installed at different distances from the inflow of rivers to the lake. The hydraulic heads in the piezometers as well as vertical profiles of Mg+2, Na/Cl, and Br/Cl were used to investigate both hydraulic and geochemical interactions between surface-water and pore-water in the lake. Depletion of lake surface water and pore water with respect to B, Br, Li+, K+, Mg(2+)and the absence of Mg-K chlorides and sulphates in the lake bed sediments is probably due to leakage of highly evaporated residual brine from the lake. Hydraulic gradients in the multilevel piezometric nests indicate that a general downward flow from surface-water to pore-water occurs across sediment-water interface. Vertical profiles of Br/Cl, Mg2+, and Na/Cl showed that the maximum flow rate was more than 1 m/yr close to the mouth of the inflowing rivers. The downward vertical flow was limited in the area far from the inflowing rivers due to the presence of an impermeable confining halite layer which interrupts the hydraulic connection between shallow pore water (less than 50 cm deep) and deeper zones. The hydraulic and geochemical interactions between surface-water and pore-water across sediment-water interface in the Maharlu Lake are of interest to find out the fate of pollutants and their distribution in the lake.					; Savadjani, Roghayeh/AAD-9616-2020; Sracek, Ondra/AAK-4593-2020	Zarei, Mehdi/0000-0002-7909-3371; Sracek, Ondra/0000-0002-3085-6358; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL 15	2020	34	15					3358	3369		10.1002/hyp.13797	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13797		JUN 2020											WOS:000544226800001

Inorganic geochemistry of El'gygytgyn Lake sediments (northeastern Russia) as an indicator of paleoclimatic change for the last 250 kyr	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The inorganic geochemistry of sediments from El'gygytgyn Lake shift in phase with interpreted paleoclimatic fluctuations seen in the record over the past 250 ka. Warm periods, when the lake was seasonally ice free and fully mixed, are characterized by increased concentrations of SiO2, CaO, Na2O, K2O, and Rb, by decreased contents of TiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3, and MgO, and by a lower chemical index of alteration (CIA). Increased levels of SiO2 reflect increases in limnic productivity whereas many of the other elements and the CIA likely reflect increased hydrological activity coincident with an increase in coarser sand and silt content and a decrease in clay mineral content. For cold/cooler periods when perennial lake ice cover lead to a stratifed water column and anoxic bottom waters, the opposite is generally observed suggesting a decrease in hydrological activity and an increase in post-depositional chemical alteration. Peaks in P2O3 and MnO, coincident with an increased abundance of vivianite, suggest possible linkages to the paleoproductivity of local fish fauna regardless of climate change across the region surrounding Lake El'gygytgyn. Strontium is high in concentration during warmer intervals and may also be linked to paleoproductivity. Enrichment of the post-Eemian portion of the sediment record in niobium, and yttrium appears independent of glacial-interglacial change; rather it may reflect a gradual shift in the geomorphology of the catchment, particularly the hydrology of large alluvial fans along the western side of the lake. In contrast to some lake records, changes in Zr concentration over time suggests only a weak, if any, increase in eolian sediment supply during colder periods.

J	Gibert, L; Orti, F; Rosell, L				Gibert, Lluis; Orti, Federico; Rosell, Laura			Plio-Pleistocene lacustrine evaporites of the Baza Basin (Betic Chain, SE Spain)	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Baza Basin (the eastern part of the Guadix-Baza Basin, in SE Spain) underwent a significant evaporitic sedimentation in non-marine settings during the Plio-Pleistocene. The largest of these settings developed in the central part of the basin as a shallow, saline lake system, where abundant gypsum deposits occur (Benamaurel and Galera Gypsum units). This paper studies these deposits from the cartographic, stratigraphic, sedimentologic, petrographic and isotopic points of view. All the gypsum has been preserved as primary enabling a good characterization of the environmental conditions of the original precipitates. Three interconnected subenvironments or zones -inner, intermediate and marginal- are differentiated in this saline lake system. In the inner zone (shallow to relatively deeper central lake), a regular alternation of gypsum and carbonate laminae accumulated suggesting a seasonal regime. Many of the gypsum laminae display size-gradation (both reverse and symmetrical) indicating free precipitation in a stable brine body. In the intermediate zone (mosaic of shallow lakes), carbonate (dolomitic) beds formed in association with dark lutite levels, gypsum beds, and gypsum nodules and micronodules. Moreover, anoxic conditions developed in this zone, which resulted in the formation of native sulphur occurrences of economic value. In the marginal zone, the evaporitic deposits are developed only locally (the Galera Gypsum unit, in particular). The various gypsum lithofacies in these marginal deposits suggest the presence of a number of shallow to exposed settings (saline mudflat, saline marsh and gypsiferous pond). The isotopic composition (delta S-34, delta O-18) of the gypsum samples is consistent with a Triassic origin of the sulphate as a result of chemical recycling. These data also suggest that a similar recycling mechanism operated in the saline lake system, where the gypsum sediments from the margins were coevally recycled towards the inner part. Both the evaporitic mineralogy and the gypsum and carbonate lithofacies suggest that semiarid conditions prevailed in this basin during the accumulation of the evaporite units. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The most apparent taxonomic shift was toward a higher relative abundance of the planktonic Cyclotella stelligera complex and a lower relative abundance of benthic Fragilaria taxa (F. pinnata, F. construens var. venter, F. construens, and F. brevistriata) in the modem versus the older sediments. Diatom assemblage composition in Slipper Lake recorded a marked change in the top 5.0 cm (ca. mid-1800s) of the core with a clear shift to a more planktonic diatom assemblage characterized by higher percentages of the Cyclotella stelligera complex. Possible causative factors, such as recent anthropogenic acidification, nutrient enrichment, or atmospheric deposition of contaminants, do not appear sufficient to explain these species changes. Instead, these recent assemblage shifts are consistent with limnological changes occurring with climatic warming, such as a shorter duration of ice cover, a longer growing season, and/or stronger thermal stratification patterns.

Hydrologic conditions in the river determine whether oxbows are isolated or connected with the river. They also determine the time and duration of both phases. The studied oxbow lake, located in the floodplain of the lower Vistula, was created as the result of river regulation in the 19th century. Observations were conducted during growing seasons in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2013, during limnophase and potamophase. The study was aimed at evaluating the impact of changes in the river level on the oxbow lake. Potamophase brought greater zooplankton diversity. We recorded a higher number of species and a higher Shannon diversity index (H'). During limnophase, higher water temperature led to greater zooplankton density. However, its diversity decreased. In recent years, probably due to climate change, the amount of precipitation has decreased. As a result, water levels in rivers are lower and potamophase is rare, while periods of isolation are longer. Low water levels in oxbows increase their primary productivity and decrease zooplankton biodiversity.

J	Kezer, K; Matsuyama, H				Kezer, K; Matsuyama, H			Decrease of river runoff in the Lake Balkhash basin in Central Asia	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					4th World Water Forum	MAR, 2006	Mexico City, MEXICO	UNESCO				The decrease of river runoff draining into Lake Balkhash in Central Asia was investigated using hydrological and meteorological data over a long-term period. The data from the difference integral curves of the annual runoff from 1911 to 1986 suggested that a low-flow period began in 1970 in the River Ili, and in 1973 in the east rivers, continuing until 1986. Compared with the runoff before 1969, the decrease of runoff in the upper reaches of the River Ili was less than those in the middle and lower reaches. The decrease in the upper reaches resulted from natural variability, whereas those of the middle and lower reaches were due to a combination of the effects of climate and human activity. There are two reasons for this. First, after 1970, precipitation did not decrease uniformly across the entire basin. Second, in 1970, the Kapchagay dam started operating. As a result, the annual inflow into Lake Balkhash from the River Ili after 1970 decreased to 77% of the pre- 1969 mean. Similarly, after 1973, the inflow from the east rivers was 75% of the pre-1972 mean. The characteristics of the runoff in the growing season (April to September) and those in the non-growing season (October to March) were investigated for the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the River Ili. In all reaches, the runoff in the non-growing season remained unchanged both before and after 1969. However, from 1970 to 1986, decreases of river flow in the growing season were 2.0 to 2.5 times greater in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reaches. This was primarily due to the impacts of human activity. In conclusion, it can be deduced that the decrease in runoff after 1970 in the middle and lower reaches was the result of human activity during the low-flow period.

Monitoring and risk assessment of heavy metals surficial sediments using the 5-step sequential extraction process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Behaviour of heavy metals in the environment is widely acknowledged to be assessed by different physicochemical forms of presence rather than their overall concentration. In this study, Tessier 5-step sequential extraction technique was used to measure the trace metal (Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe, Pb, Co, Cd) fractions in surficial sediments in different seasons, in turn, analyse the risk posed by different fractions to the aquatic ecosystem. The findings reveal that residual fraction (F5) is in highest proportion (similar to 44%) among the trace metals analysed. However, the proportion of carbonate and exchangeable fractions was comparatively higher (similar to 24%), posing amajor risk to the aquatic ecosystem. Particle size v/s metal fraction scatter-plots showed that in the case of Cu, Fe and Mn, there is some form of both anthropogenic and natural pollution during the studied period, whereas, in rest of the metals, pollution is due to natural sources. Principal component analysis (PCA) led to the generation of 2 principal components (PCs), which accounted for approximately 80% of the total variance. PC1 and PC2 accounted for 45% and 35% of the total variance, respectively, which helped identify the pollution source as anthropogenic Then, risk assessment code (RAC) revealed, Zn (41%), Mn (35%), Cu (35%), and Pb (27%) posed ahigher threat in drier months. In contrast, Co (40%) and Cd (48%) pose a higher threat with monsoon onset, showing variation of mobility of different metals in different seasons. Fe is the least mobile among the metals analysed, posing very little to the aquatic environment. Then, comparison with sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) reveals, although their potential hazard is high, they never surpass the SQGs. Thus, trace metal sediment contamination does not pose any risk to the river's aquatic environment in the present study but calls for stringent measures employment in river pollution abatement.

During this study, we explored the possibility that alternative host plants have a central role in the survival of common bean viruses. We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques to sequence virus-derived small interfering RNAs together with conventional reverse-transcription PCRs (RT-PCRs) to detect viruses in wild plants. Leaf samples for RNA extraction and NGS were collected from 1,430 wild plants around and within common bean fields in four agricultural zones in Tanzania. At least partial genome sequences of viruses potentially belonging to 25 genera were detected. The greatest virus diversity was detected in the eastern and northern zones, whereas wild plants in the Lake zone and especially in the southern highlands zone showed only a few viruses. The RT-PCR analysis of all collected plant samples confirmed the presence of yam bean mosaic virus and peanut mottle virus in wild legume plants. Of all viruses detected, only two viruses, cucumber mosaic virus and a novel bromovirus related to cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and brome mosaic virus, were mechanically transmitted from wild plants to common bean plants. The data generated during this study are crucial for the development of viral disease management strategies and predicting crop viral disease outbreaks in different agricultural regions in Tanzania and beyond.

Among other stressors, urban streams often are host to elevated concentrations of nutrients, salts, and heavy metals. The pollutants, coupled with high temperatures, are drivers of ecosystem degradation in urban streams. The installation of artificial floating wetlands (AFWs) has been successful in mitigating the effects of urbanization in lakes and wastewater treatment ponds, but rarely have they been tested in streams. This pilot-study examined the ability of an AFW to improve water quality in an urban stream. The small, 90 m(2) AFW was installed to improve the aquatic habitat and aesthetics of a small section of the Chicago River, Chicago, IL USA. Water samples and in-situ measurements were collected from the surface and at 0.3 m depth of upstream and downstream of the AFW. Samples were analyzed for nitrate-as-nitrogen, phosphate, chloride, and heavy metals. Comparison of upstream and downstream waters showed that the AFW lowered the concentrations of nitrate-as-nitrogen and phosphate during the growing season by 6.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Nitrate was also removed during the dormant season; however, phosphate was not removed during that time. Plant or microbial uptake of the nutrients are believed to be the dominant mechanisms in the growing season with denitrification serving as the primary pathway in the dormant season. Despite not having a measurable effect on the water temperature, the AFW was an effective means to reduce concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus, decreasing the potential for eutrophication.

Successful invasions depend on the interplay of multiple abiotic and biotic factors, however, the process of the invasion itself is often overlooked. The temporal variation of environmental factors suggests that a 'window of opportunity' for successful invasions exists. Especially aquatic habitats, like temperate lakes, undergo pronounced seasonal fluctuations and show temporally varying environmental conditions in e.g. nutrient availability, temperature and the composition of the resident community including competitors and consumers. We experimentally tested if an invasion window for the globally invasive cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii exists. From May to September, we determined the invasion success of C. raciborskii in laboratory mesocosms with natural lake water. Although the invasion success was generally low, the invasiveness varied among months and differed in total invasive biomass, net development and final share of C. raciborskii in the community. During the first days, C. raciborskii strongly declined and this initial, short-term decline was independent of the ambient consumptive pressure. These results are in contrast to laboratory studies in which C. raciborskii successfully invaded, suggesting that a complex natural system develops a resistance to invasions.

Factors Controlling Methane in Arctic Lakes of Southwest Greenland	PLOS ONE												We surveyed 15 lakes during the growing season of 2014 in Arctic lakes of southwest Greenland to determine which factors influence methane concentrations in these systems. Methane averaged 2.5 mu mol L-1 in lakes, but varied a great deal across the landscape with lakes on older landscapes farther from the ice sheet margin having some of the highest values of methane reported in lakes in the northern hemisphere (125 mu mol L-1). The most important factors influencing methane in Greenland lakes included ionic composition (SO4, Na, Cl) and chlorophyll a in the water column. DOC concentrations were also related to methane, but the short length of the study likely underestimated the influence and timing of DOC on methane concentrations in the region. Atmospheric methane concentrations are increasing globally, with freshwater ecosystems in northern latitudes continuing to serve as potentially large sources in the future. Much less is known about how freshwater lakes in Greenland fit in the global methane budget compared to other, more well-studied areas of the Arctic, hence our work provides essential data for a more complete view of this rapidly changing region.

Coal mine drainage generally contains a variety of organic matter and heavy metals due to coal mining activities. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the physicochemical and biological processes of many aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the investigations were carried out in the dry and wet seasons in 2021 to assess the characteristics of DOM compounds in coal mine drainage and the CMD-affected river. The results indicated that the pH of CMD-affected river pressed close to coal mine drainage. Besides, coal mine drainage lowered DO by 36% and increased total dissolved solids by 19% in the CMD-affected river. Coal mine drainage decreased absorption coefficient a(350) and absorption spectral slope S275-295 of DOM in the CMD-affected river; hence, DOM molecular size increased with decreasing S275-295. Three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis identified humic-like C1, tryptophan-like C2, and tyrosine-like C3 in the CMD-affected river and coal mine drainage. DOM in the CMD-affected river mainly originated from microbial and terrestrial sources, with strong endogenous characteristics. The ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry analysis revealed that coal mine drainage had a higher relative abundance of CHO (44.79%), with a higher unsaturation degree of DOM. Coal mine drainage decreased the AI(mod,wa), DBEwa (double bond equivalents), O-wa, N-wa, and S-wa values and increased the relative abundance of the O3S1 species with DBE of 3 and carbons number range of 15-17 at the CMD inlet to the river channel. Moreover, coal mine drainage with the higher protein content increased the protein content of water at the CMD inlet to the river channel and the downstream river. DOM compositions and proprieties in coal mine drainage were investigated to further understand the influence of organic matter on heavy metals in future study.

C.; Couture, Patrice			Evidence for metabolic imbalance of vitamin A2 in wild fish chronically exposed to metals	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												In a recent study on indigenous yellow perch chronically exposed to metals, we reported a negative correlation between liver metal concentration and liver transcription levels of genes encoding for enzymes involved in the metabolism of retinoids. We therefore speculated that metals, and especially the non-essential metal Cd, could alter the metabolism of retinoids in wild fish. Thus the present field study investigates the impact of in situ metal exposure on retinoid storage. A total of 55 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were sampled in six lakes representing a metal contamination gradient (8 <= N <= 10 per lake). Our results show that yellow perch from Cd-contaminated lakes had significantly higher concentrations of liver dehydroretinol and dehydroretinyl esters than did fish from reference lakes. However, the increase in retinyl ester stores with increasing Cd concentrations was quantitatively much more important than the increase in free dehydroretinol. As a result, a significant decrease in the percentage of hepatic free dehydroretinol with increasing renal Cd concentrations was observed. These results suggest that the enzymes and the binding proteins involved in vitamin A homeostasis are inhibited by the presence of Cd. Alternatively, the increase in tissue vitamin A (antioxidant) levels could serve to better counteract the oxidative stress engendered by Cd exposure. Overall our findings illustrate that vitamin A(2) homeostasis can be altered as a consequence of chronic exposure to low Cd concentrations. Thus, in the context of environmental risk assessment, the percentage of liver free dehydroretinol can be considered as a biomarker of for in situ Cd exposure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

J	Border, S; Sawyer, L				Border, S.; Sawyer, L.			Evaporites and brines - geological, hydrological and chemical aspects of resource estimation	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF MINING AND METALLURGY SECTION B-APPLIED EARTH SCIENCE												Modern salt lakes are complex systems which are exploited for a variety of minerals, including solid and dissolved phases (brines). Phases commonly exploited include lithium, potassium and boron minerals, mainly from brines, and solid minerals including halite and gypsum. Resource estimation and successful exploitation of either solid minerals or brines require good understanding of the complex interactions within these systems. This includes careful definition of climate, geology, hydrogeology (hydrology), fluid flow dynamics and lastly chemical ion concentrations. Therefore estimation involves multidisciplinary team work. Brines are mobile resources which change through time, sometimes seasonally, so estimators must understand the climatic, hydrological and geological factors governing flows of both water and salts into and out of the system. Commercial extraction of brines involves brine collection (usually by pumping from wells) at rates that make the extraction economic, so brine resources should include only extractable brines, which are those in accessible aquifers available for pumping. Estimators must take into account potential limits on sustainable extraction rates when assessing the prospects for eventual economic extraction to determine whether a resource is present. Drilling on salt lakes can present significant challenges in safe access, and in recovery of uncontaminated samples of host rocks, which are often unconsolidated, and of brines. The merits of various methods of drilling and sampling are discussed. We recommend a combination of different sampling methods and the use of downhole geophysics to assist in detailed geological interpretation. Well-designed pump testing will provide hydrogeological parameters and enable derivation of the specific yields of all targeted aquifers, which are required to estimate total extractable brine resources. Reliable repeatable chemical analyses of brine samples are hard to achieve, and filtering, minimising storage times, and the choice of a reliable laboratory experienced in brine analyses will all assist in this objective. Stringent quality control is required, and this should include check analyses at one or more independent laboratories. Resampling of the same sample sites will measure seasonal and other fluctuations. Resource reporting must include discussion of all material factors and assumptions, and include discussion of limiting extraction rates, and risks to the sustainable extraction of the resource, which may include climatic risks and risk from neighbouring production. All resources need to have reasonable prospects for economic extraction, so the estimator must be familiar with potential exploitation methods (which include dredging or conventional mining for solid minerals, and for brines pumping from wells, brine recovery via ditches, evaporation and chemical separation) and the factors that affect the cost or feasibility of these methods. The potential for extraction to affect the remaining resource (e.g. by brine pressure reduction, increasingly dilute inflows into a brine resource, dissolution or enhanced crystallisation of solid minerals) must be considered. Resource classification must take into account the definitions of the higher confidence (Indicated and Measured) resources to be able to support mine planning, and we consider these classifications require a hydrological model, based on at least preliminary field testing for indicated, and a geological model and knowledge of chemistry across the resource volume.																			0371-7453	1743-2758					2014	123	2			SI		95	106		10.1179/1743275814Y.0000000053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1743275814Y.0000000053													WOS:000210831900004

Hydrological dynamics of water sources in a Mediterranean lagoon	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lagoons are important ecosystems occupying large coastal areas worldwide. Lagoons contain various mixtures of marine and freshwater sources which are highly dynamic in time. However, it often remains a challenge to identify and quantify dynamic changes of water sources, particularly in heterogeneous lagoon systems like the Koycegiz-Dalyan lagoon (KDL), which is located at the south-west of Turkey on the Mediterranean Sea coast. The objective of this study was to quantify different contributions of potential water sources i.e. surface water, groundwater and seawater in the lagoon and how these water sources changed over time and space. In the wet-and dry-season stable isotopes of water, chloride concentration (Cl-) and salinity were measured in two depths in the lagoon and surrounding water bodies (sea, lake, groundwater). Different components of water sources were quantified with a three component endmember mixing analysis. Differences in Cl- and stable isotopes over time indicated the dynamic behaviour of the system. Generally, none of the groundwater samples was impacted by water of the Mediterranean Sea. During the wet season, most of the lagoon water (> 95 %) was influenced by freshwater and vertically well mixed. During the dry season, high Cl- in the deeper sampling locations indicated a high contribution of marine water throughout the entire lagoon system due to saltwater intrusion. However, a distinct layering in the lagoon was obvious from low Cl- and depleted isotope contents close to the surface supporting freshwater inflow into the system even during the dry season. Besides temporal dynamics also spatial heterogeneities were identified. Changes in water sources were most evident in the main lagoon channel compared to more isolate lagoon lakes, which were influenced by marine water even in the wet season, and compared to side branches indicating slower turnover times. We found that environmental tracers helped to quantify highly dynamic and heterogeneous contributions of different water sources in the Koycegiz-Dalyan lagoon.

Flow regime change in an endorheic basin in southern Ethiopia	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Endorheic basins, often found in semi-arid and arid climates, are particularly sensitive to variation in fluxes such as precipitation, evaporation and runoff, resulting in variability of river flows as well as of water levels in end-point lakes that are often present. In this paper we apply the indicators of hydrological alteration (IHA) to characterise change to the natural flow regime of the Omo-Ghibe Basin in southern Ethiopia. Little water resource infrastructure has been developed in the basin to date, and it is considered pristine. The basin is endorheic and is the main source of flow to Lake Turkana in the East African Rift Valley. The water level in Lake Turkana shows significant fluctuation, but increase of its level can be observed over the past 20 years. The reasons are currently not well understood. Of the five groups of hydrological characteristics in the IHA (magnitude, timing, duration, frequency and variability), only those related to magnitude were found to show significant trends, with the main trend being the increase of flow during the dry season. This trend was not reflected in climatological drivers such as rainfall, evaporation and temperature (which shows a positive trend), but rather is attributed to the substantial changes in land use and land cover in the basin. The change in the basin hydrology is apparent mainly in the more humid part of the basin. The significant shift from forest and woodland to grassland and cropland results in a decrease of actual evaporation and subsequent increase in (dry season) runoff. The long-term trend of the increasing levels in Lake Turkana are related to these trends in dry season flows, while shorter-term fluctuations of the lake levels are attributed primarily to anomalies in consecutive wet and dry season rainfall.					van der Zaag, Pieter/B-8247-2008; Wright, Nigel/B-3846-2009; Wright, Nigel/ABO-7247-2022; Werner, Micha/C-8144-2009	van der Zaag, Pieter/0000-0002-1215-2656; Wright, Nigel/0000-0002-1289-2830; Werner, Micha/0000-0003-4198-5638													1027-5606	1607-7938					2014	18	9					3837	3853		10.5194/hess-18-3837-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-18-3837-2014													WOS:000343118500032

Virus-like particle (VLP) concentrations varied between 4.16 x 10(7) (January) and 2.08 x 10(8) part mL(-1) (May) in Lake Bourget and between 2.7 x 10(7) (June) and 8.39 x 10(7) part mL(-1) (November) in Lake Annecy. Our flow cytometry analysis revealed at least three viral groups (referred to as virus-like particles 1, 2, and 3) that exhibited distinctive dynamics suggestive of different host types. Phage-induced bacterial mortality varied between 6.1 % (June) and 33.2 % (October) in Lake Bourget and between 7.4 % (June) and 52.6 % (November) in Lake Annecy, suggesting that viral lysis may be a key cause of mortality of the bacterioplankton. Virioplankton genome size ranged from 27 to 486 kb in Lake Bourget, while it reached 620 kb in Lake Annecy for which larger genome sizes were recorded. Our analysis of pulsed field gel electrophoresis bands using different PCR primers targeting both cyanophages and algal viruses showed that (1) dsDNA viruses infecting phytoplankton may range from 65 to 486 kb, and (2) both cyanophage and algal "diversity" were higher in Lake Annecy. Lakes Annecy and Bourget also differed regarding the proportions of both viral families (with the dominance of myoviruses vs. podoviruses) and infected bacterial morphotypes (short rods vs. elongated rods), in each of these lakes, respectively. Overall, our results reveal that (1) viruses displayed distinct temporal and vertical distribution, dynamics, community structure in terms of genome size and morphology, and viral activity in the two lakes; (2) the Myoviridae seemed to be the main cause of bacterial mortality in both lakes and this group seemed to be related to VLP2; and (3) phytoplankton viruses may have a broader range of genome size than previously thought. This study adds to growing evidence that viruses are diverse and play a significant role in freshwater microbial dynamics and more globally lake functioning. It highlights the importance of further considering this biological compartment for a better understanding of plankton ecology in peri-alpine lakes.

J	Andrade, CA; Barton, ED				Andrade, CA; Barton, ED			The Guajira upwelling system	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The coastal upwelled waters of the Guajira coast, the most northerly peninsula of South America, were studied on the basis of historical data bases, remotely sensed data, and three oceanographic cruises. The Guajira Peninsula is the locus of particularly strong upwelling because it protrudes into the Caribbean Low-Level Wind Jet and its west coast parallels the direction of the strongest winds. The year-round upwelling varies with the wind forcing: strongest in December-March and July, and weakest in the October-November rainy season. The east-west temperature, salinity and density front that delimits the upwelling lies over the shelf edge in the east of the peninsula but separates from the south-westward trending topography to the west. A coastal westward surface jet geostrophically adjusted to the upwelling flows along the front, and an eastward sub-surface counterflow is trapped against the Guajira continental slope. The undercurrent shoals toward the western limit of the upwelling, Santa Marta, beyond which point it extends to the surface. Some of the westward jet re-circulates inshore with the counterflow but part continues directly west to form an upwelling filament. Much of the mesoscale variation is associated with upwelling filaments, which expel cooler, chlorophyll- rich coastal upwelling waters westward and northward into the Caribbean Sea. Freshwater plumes from the Magdalena and Orinoco rivers influence the area strongly, and outflow from Lake Maracaibo interacts directly with upwelled waters off Guajira. Another important factor is the Aeolian input of dust from the Guajira desert by episodes of offshore winds. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Timothy			Annual-scale assessment of mid-20th century anthropogenic impacts on the algal ecology of Crawford Lake, Ontario, Canada	PEERJ												Meromictic Crawford Lake, located in SW Ontario, Canada is characterized by varved sediments, making it suitable for high-resolution paleoecological studies. Freeze cores, the only coring method available that reliably preserves the fragile laminations representative of seasonal deposition in the lake, were used to document siliceous diatom and chrysophyte community structure at an annual resolution from 1930- 1990CE. Stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis identified major assemblage changes that are believed to have been caused by local, regional and possibly global anthropogenic impacts. The assemblage changes within the siliceous algae are attributed to regional weather and increased industrial emissions and related effects of acid deposition on the lake's catchment associated with the Great Acceleration -the massive economic, industrial, and demographic expansion beginning in the mid-20th century. Observed increases in spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) in varved lake sediment dating to the early 1950s record rapidly expanding steel production without emission controls around 30 km upwind of the lake. The findings reported here reflect major changes in earth systems that the Anthropocene Working Group recommends for a proposed epoch to be termed the Anthropocene, providing support for the laminated sediments from Crawford Lake as a potential Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP).

Sinninghe			Diversity of Archaea and detection of crenarchaeotal amoA genes in the rivers Rhine and Tet	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Pelagic archaeal phylogenetic diversity and the potential for crenarchaeotal nitrification of Group 1.1a were determined in the rivers Rhine and Tet by 16S rRNA sequencing, catalyzed reported deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) and quantification of 16S rRNA and functional genes. Euryarchaeota were, for the first time, detected in temperate river water even though a net predominance of crenarchaeotal phylotypes was found. Differences in phylogenic distribution were observed between rivers and seasons. Our data suggest that a few archaeal phylotypes (Euryarchaeota Groups RC-V and LDS, Crenarchaeota Group 1.1a) are widely distributed in pelagic riverine environments whilst others (Euryarchaeota Cluster Sagma-1) may only occur seasonally in river water. Crenarchaeota Group 1.1a has recently been identified as a major nitrifier in the marine environment and phylotypes of this group were also present in both rivers, where they represented 0.3% of the total pelagic microbial community. Interestingly, a generally higher abundance of Crenarchaeota Group 1.1a was found in the Rhine than in the Tet, and crenarchaeotal ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA) was also detected in the Rhine, with higher amoA copy numbers measured in February than in September. This suggests that some of the Crenarchaeota present in river waters have the ability to oxidize ammonia and that riverine crenarchaeotal nitrification of Group 1.1a may vary seasonally.

Phosphatase activity and organic phosphorus turnover on a high Arctic glacier	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Arctic glacier surfaces harbour abundant microbial communities consisting mainly of heterotrophic and photoautotrophic bacteria. The microbes must cope with low concentrations of nutrients and with the fact that both the dissolved and debris-bound nutrient pools are dominated by organic phases. Here we provide evidence that phosphorus (P) is deficient in the supraglacial environment on a Svalbard glacier, we quantify the enzymatic activity of phosphatases in the system and we estimate the contribution of the microbes to the cycling of the dominant organic P in the supraglacial environment. Incubation of cryoconite debris revealed significant phosphatase activity in the samples (19-67 nmol MUP g(-1) h(-1)). It was inhibited by inorganic P during incubations and had its optimum at around 30 degrees C. The phosphatase activity measured at near-in situ temperature and substrate concentration suggests that the available dissolved organic P can be turned over by microbes within similar to 3-11 h on the glacier surface. By contrast, the amount of potentially bioavailable debris-bound organic P is sufficient for a whole ablation season. However, it is apparent that some of this potentially bioavailable debris-bound P is not accessible to the microbes.					; Anesio, Alexandre/A-7597-2008; Stibal, Marek/I-3852-2016; Tranter, Martyn/E-3722-2010	Stibal, Marek/0000-0002-9998-5086; Anesio, Alexandre/0000-0003-2990-4014; Tranter, Martyn/0000-0003-2071-3094													1726-4170						2009	6	5					913	922		10.5194/bg-6-913-2009	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-6-913-2009													WOS:000266556300014

Customization and Validation of a Regional Climate Model Using Satellite Data Over East Africa	ATMOSPHERE												This study focused on the customization of the fourth generation International Center for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model version 4.4 and its ability to reproduce the mean climate and most dominant modes of variability over East Africa. The simulations were performed at a spatial resolution of 25 km for the period 1998-2013. The model was driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis. The customization focus was on cumulus and microphysics schemes during the Short Rains for the year 2000. The best physics combinations were then utilized for the validation studies. The East Africa region and Lake Victoria Basin region are adapted to carry out empirical orthogonal function analysis, during the Short and Long Rains. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data was utilized in the validation of the model. The first mode of variability from the model and observational data during the Short Rains was associated with the warming of the Pacific Ocean and the sea surface temperature gradients over the Indian Ocean. During the Long rains, the inter-annual rainfall variability over the Lake Victoria region was associated with the sea surface temperature anomaly over the Indian Ocean and for the East Africa region the associations were weak. The drivers during the Long Rains over East Africa region were then further investigated by splitting the season to the March-April and May periods. The March-April period was positively correlated to the West Pacific and Indian Ocean dipole index, while May was associated with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. In conclusion, although the model can reproduce the dominant modes of variability as in the observational data sets during the Short Rains, skill was lower during the Long Rains.

Best predictors for postflre mortality of ponderosa pine trees in the intermountain west	FOREST SCIENCE												Numerous wildfires in recent years have highlighted managers' needs for reliable tools to predict postfire mortality of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) trees. General applicability of existing mortality models is uncertain, as researchers have used different sets of variables. We quantified tree attributes, crown and bole fire damage, ground fire severity, and insect presence from a total of 5,083 trees in four 2000 wildfires in four Intermountain states. Crown scorch (percentage) and consumption (percentage) volume collectively accounted for the majority of predictive capacity in all four individual models and in the pooled four-site model. The addition of tree diameter and presence of 1ps beetles in the pooled model slightly improved predictive power. Four other statistically significant variables added little to the pooled model's predictive ability. The pooled model correctly classified 3-year postfire mortality of 89.9% of the trees and had a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) score of 0.96. In the external validation step, the model correctly classified 3-year postfire mortality of 96% of 1,361 trees in a 2001 wildfire. Our results and a number of previous studies suggest that a two-variable model using percentage crown scorch volume and crown consumed volume will have applicability beyond the Intermountain West.					negron, jose/AAE-1935-2020														0015-749X	1938-3738				DEC	2006	52	6					718	728																WOS:000242812500010

Investigation of water quality on Gokcekaya dam lake using multivariate statistical analysis, in EskiAYehir, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Gok double dagger ekaya Dam is one of the dams located on the Sakarya River (EskiAYehir) in Turkey and is approximately 38 years old. No study regarding to the water quality of the dam lake has been hitherto made. This study aimed at determining the seasonal variations with physical, chemical, and biological parameters of the water quality of the dam lake. Depth-wise water samples were taken from five selected stations, in seasonal periods during 2005-2008, and anlayzed. The quality of water was classified in accordance with the results and taking into consideration many parameters. At the same time, number and type diversities of dissolved heavy metals and algae population were analyzed. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and classification analysis (CA) methods, differences between these parameters and samples from stations have been determined . The analysis showed that Gok double dagger ekaya dam lake, formerly an oligotrophic lake, has become a mesotrophic lake. And according to the results thereof the Lake has mezotrophic characteristics due to the sudden changes (including household waste water inflow and opening the SarA +/- yar dam lake shutters) in certain periods and in some stations. Hierarchical clustering analysis, revealed no significant difference between the measured parameters. And according to the Water Pollution Control Regulations in Turkey (WPCR) Gok double dagger ekaya dam lake is in the first class quality in terms of anions, cations, heavy metals, temperature, and pH values. However, the is of first class quality presence of nitrite reduces the water quality in the lake and causes this lake to be classified in the fourth class quality.					; ATICI, Tahir/AAB-8966-2021; Katırcıoğlu, Hikmet/AHE-2104-2022	ATICI, Tahir/0000-0002-3396-3407; Katircioglu, Hikmet/0000-0002-4866-6106; Akin, Beril/0000-0003-1730-154X													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2011	63	6					1251	1261		10.1007/s12665-010-0798-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-010-0798-6													WOS:000292043100009

The modelled environment, consisting of up to 19 compartments, includes the forest, soils and fresh water bodies of the drainage basin, and a variable number of sequentially arranged marine water units, representing estuarine, coastal, open and deep water environments. Two sediment compartments in each water basin allow to account for the possibility of the simultaneous occurrence of eroding and accumulating bottoms in a water basin. As the movement of POPs in the environment is closely associated with the movement of air, water and organic matter, the model constructs complete steady state mass budgets for air, water and particulate organic carbon (POC) between the model compartments from the environmental parameters supplied by the user. This assures that these input parameters, which can be stored in a database, are all mutually compatible and internally consistent. The CoZMo-POP 2 model takes into account seasonably variable wind speeds, temperatures, canopy developments and OH radical concentrations, and allows for the definition of time-variant emission scenarios. CoZMo-POP 2 is a flexible, dynamic MFTM that can be used for detailed investigation of a particular fate process using a generic environmental scenario, as well as for simulations of the behaviour of a particular POP in a particular environment. All of the model equations, which are expressed in fugacity notation, are provided. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An assessment of the factors determining rotifer assemblage in river-lake systems: the effects of seasonality and habitat	ZOOLOGIA												Zooplankton exhibit several trends of variation in space and time, and these trends can be more evident in natural environments without anthropic perturbations. Examples of anthropic factors are climate change, eutrophication and construction of reservoirs. This study evaluated the influence of three factors - seasonality, type of environment and the presence of aquatic macrophytes - on various ecological attributes of rotifers in a river-lake system located in the Parana River floodplain. Monthly samplings were conducted during 1993 and 1994. The mean species richness per sample was 60 species. The seasonality and the type of environment influenced the ecological attributes of rotifer assemblages, while the presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes did not. Species richness was highest in the lake system and during the months when water levels were low. Multivariate analysis indicates a small group of species associated with the low water-level phase. In contrast, many species were associated with high water levels or increasing water levels. The seasonal variation of hydrological cycle and the type of environment are the most important factors for rotifer structure in natural conditions.					; Lansac-Toha, Fábio/I-3556-2016; Neves, Gilmar/AAU-9172-2020	Perbiche Neves, Gilmar/0000-0002-5025-2703; Lansac-Toha, Fabio/0000-0001-6746-8052													1984-4689					MAY 28	2019	36								e24191	10.3897/zoologia.36.e24191	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zoologia.36.e24191													WOS:000469273300001

This article analyzed periods of the medium-term EASWJ variation, wave packet distribution and energy propagation of Rossby waves along the EASWJ during Meiyu season, and investigated their possible influence on abnormal Meiyu rain. The results showed that during the medium-term scale atmospheric dynamic process, the evolution of the EASWJ in Meiyu season was mainly characterized by the changes of 3-8 d synoptic-scale and 10-15 d low-frequency Rossby waves. The strong perturbation wave packet and energy propagation of the 3-8 d synoptic-scale and 10 15 d low-frequency Rossby waves are mostly concentrated in the East Asian region of 90 degrees-150 degrees E, where the two wave trains of perturbation wave packets and wave-activity flux divergence coexist in zonal and meridional directions, and converge on the EASWJ. Besides, the wave trains of perturbation wave packet and wave-activity flux divergence in wet Meiyu years are more systematically westward than those in dry Meiyu years, and they are shown in the inverse phases between each other. In wet (dry) Meiyu year, the perturbation wave packet high-value area of the 10-15 d low-frequency variability is located between the Aral Sea and the Lake Balkhash (in the northeastern part of China), while over eastern China the wave-activity flux is convergent and strong (divergent and weak), and the high-level jets are strong and southward (weak and northward). Because of the coupling of high and low level atmosphere and high-level strong (weak) divergence on the south side of the jet over the Yangtze-Huaihe River Basin, the low-level southwest wind and vertically ascending motion are strengthened (weakened), which is (is not) conducive to precipitation increase in the Yangtze-Huaihe River Basin. These findings would help to better understand the impact mechanisms of the EASWJ activities on abnormal Meiyu from the perspective of medium-term scale Rossby wave energy propagation.					yang, ning/GZA-6635-2022														1006-8775					JUN	2020	26	2					125	136		10.46267/j.1006-8775.2020.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.46267/j.1006-8775.2020.012													WOS:000541063300001

The results showed that: (1) In the classification of first-level landscape elements, water patches accounted for 63.879% of the total area and had a high degree of aggregation; the number of green space patches was the largest and the average patch density was the largest; the construction land area was the smallest, the aggregation degree was the lowest; Shannon diversity index (SHDI) was 0.872, Shannon evenness index (SHEI) was 0.794. (2) In the classification of second-level landscape elements, the area of water surface was 2.256 times of wetland, the area of multi-layer green space was 2.19 times of grassland. The area of building was the largest in construction land. The shape index (LSI) of road was the largest. The SHDI was 1.538, and the SHEI was 0.791. (3) The ecotourism carrying capacity of Pan'an Lake Wetland Park was 23,226-35,240 persons/day, 8,477.49-12,862.6 thousand persons/year, watching-birds capacity was the limiting factor of ecological capacity, while catering facilities were the limiting factor of facility capacity. (4) Landscape pattern has a certain impact on the carrying capacity of ecotourism. The higher evenness index increased the possibility of tourists' diversion in different scenic spots in peak season and the bird watching capacity should be improved by increasing the LSI of the roads in Pan'an Lake Wetland Park. Ecotourism carrying capacity may be increased by increasing construction land area, but the ecological effect of wetland park may be reduced.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2020	188						288	296		10.5004/dwt.2020.25281	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2020.25281													WOS:000545027300025

L. M.			The need for advancing algal bloom forecasting using remote sensing and modeling: Progress and future directions	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Algal blooms are often major drivers of environmental and economic challenges. As these blooms increase in frequency and size, there is an increasing need for forecasting models to accurately predict their occurrence and progression. Such algal bloom forecast systems can provide early warnings to mitigate the harmful impacts on ecosystems and public health. This study presents an overview of the current progress for algal bloom forecasting (i.e., predicting the future occurrence, distribution, frequency, and intensity of algal blooms in water bodies) and emphasizes the need for research initiatives and future directions on this topic. Remote sensing, particularly ocean-color products, has emerged as a foundation for algal bloom monitoring and forecasting, providing critical spatial-temporal data to address the limitations of in situ measurements. Machine learning and deep learning models dominate recent developments, demonstrating their capabilities in capturing non-linear and complex dynamics and enhancing accuracy in forecasting. Forecast intervals used vary, ranging from daily forecasts to weeks, monthly, seasonal, and annual predictions. A relevant aspect of algal bloom forecasting is the input variables, and we identified the key inputs, including surface temperature, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, wind patterns, and previous/current bloom information. However, most studies are geographically concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, specifically North America, Europe, and Asia, focusing on lakes and coastal waters, leaving tropical regions, rivers, reservoirs, and open oceans underexplored. Despite the advancement in this field, operational algal bloom forecasting systems are still scarce, particularly when compared to other environmental fields, such as meteorology and air quality forecasting. With new hyperspectral capabilities being developed, integrating these emerging technologies offers unprecedented opportunities to refine predictions, particularly for phytoplankton community composition and functional types. This study emphasizes the need to expand forecasting research to underrepresented regions and water body types, such as reservoirs and estuaries. Under current climate change scenarios, algal blooms may become more frequent and intense, and it is crucial to continuously develop and advance algal bloom research to support coastal and inland water management.

Research on the spatiotemporal variations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in lacustrine systems is typically plagued, however, by a lack of long-term, spatially continuous monitoring data. This paper assembled a 30-year (1989-2018) data set of water quality in 586 lakes and reservoirs in China, along with basin characteristics and climate conditions, forming the comprehensive data set available. These data were then used in a stacking model (based on random forest, support vector regression, and K-nearest neighbor models) to identify the relationships between nutrient concentrations and their influencing factors, including net anthropogenic N/P inputs, geographical position, climate, land use pattern, and soil type. The stacking models were developed using data collected over multiple time scales (annual, seasonal, and monthly), which were then applied to reconstruct TN and TP concentrations during the periods of 1980-2018 and 2020s-2050s under the climate scenarios of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The accuracy of the stacking models was 99.1% and 98.3% for TN and TP concentrations using ensembled data, respectively. The interannual variations in TN and TP contents in the 586 lakes and reservoirs during 1980-2018 exhibited a non-monotonic pattern with a peak of 1.12 and 0.049 mg/L in 2007, respectively. This study demonstrates that stacking machine learning models represent a new effective approach for estimating nutrient concentrations in unmonitored lakes and reservoirs across broad spatiotemporal scales.

Lake stratification in the Brazilian Amazon: Types and the first description of permanent meromixia	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												An investigation into the physical and chemical stratification processes of the waters of 45 lakes in Central Amazonian was carried out, based on data from 1995 to 2022. Stratification profile and behavior; partial and total circulation trends; seasonality; classification and typology of the lakes of the Amazon plain were considered. The purpose of this study was to identify the limnological, hydrological and geomorphological factors most relevant to the stratification processes. Monitoring data were obtained from daily and seasonal samplings. Among the analyzed parameters are temperature; density; transparency; euphotic zone; attenuation coefficient; incident and refracted radiation profile; dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, salinity, suspended material and turbidity concentrations; climatic and hydrological factors; level of protection of the shores; topography of shore and bottom; shape and geometric pattern of lakes. PCA, Cluster and Pearson's analysis and numerical models were applied to the results. Lakes with total circulation patterns, multiple layered circulations, varying degrees of polymixy, and lakes with seasonal and permanent meromixy were identified. The concentration of total solids, depth, morphometry, intensity of the refracted radiation and the action of the winds were the factors considered preponderant for the identification of the stratification processes. Hydrological models were established based on the classification and typology of the lakes studied. The simulation results allowed the following conclusions: a) coefficients t1 and t2 < 0 suggest increase; b) 0< t1 and t2 < 1 is equivalent to a curve with linear trend; c) t1 and t2 > 1 is equivalent to a curve with a tendency to stratification; d) the higher the numerical value of t1,2, means resistant stratification (permanent meromixia).

The continuing degradation of Lake Victoria's ecological functions has serious long-term consequences for the ecosystem services it provides, and may threaten social welfare in the countries bordering its shores. Evaluation of recent ecological changes in the context of aquatic food-web alterations, catchment disturbance and natural ecosystem variability has been hampered by the scarcity of historical monitoring data. Here, we present high-resolution palaeolimnological data, which show that increases in phytoplankton production developed from the 1930s onwards, which parallels human-population growth and agricultural activity in the Lake Victoria drainage basin. Dominance of bloom-forming cyanobacteria since the late 1980s coincided with a relative decline in diatom growth, which can be attributed to the seasonal depletion of dissolved silica resulting from 50 years of enhanced diatom growth and burial. Eutrophication-induced loss of deep-water oxygen started in the early 1960s, and may have contributed to the 1980s collapse of indigenous fish stocks by eliminating suitable habitat for certain deep-water cichlids. Conservation of Lake Victoria as a functioning ecosystem is contingent upon large-scale implementation of improved land-use practices.

Ecological risk assessment approaches, including hazard quotient and overlapping areas of probability density curves, were performed to evaluate the combined ecological risks of PAHs to the aquatic organisms. The result from hazard quotient indicated that risk quotient of mollusks and zooplankton surpassed 0.1, suggesting potential risks. The potentially affected fractions of PAHs obtained from overlapping areas of probability density curve varied from 11.2% (dry season) to 5.1% (rainy season), which implied that PAHs had been posing pressures on the ecosystem. Health risk based on the incremental lifetime risk for PAHs was conducted to evaluate human cancer risk and noncarcinogenic hazard in the studied area. The results indicated that health risks mainly came from ingestion exposure pathway. The total cancer risks were in the range of 10(-8) to 10(-7), lower than the baseline value of acceptable risk (10(-6)). Moreover, non-carcinogenic hazard indices of PAHs ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-5) were much lower than the threshold values (1.0). These results indicated that the water from middle and lower reaches of Yellow River might pose no health risk on local residents as a source of drinking water.					; LIU, SHUHUI/IYS-9738-2023; Li, Xiaoying/LIA-8834-2024; Sun, Jianhui/K-8521-2014	Li, Xiaoying/0000-0002-6005-4620; 													1040-6638	1563-5333					2016	36	5					656	670		10.1080/10406638.2015.1042552	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10406638.2015.1042552													WOS:000387296000006

Interactive effects of sex and body size on the movement ecology of adfluvial bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Animal movement occurs as a function of many factors including changing environmental conditions (e. g., seasonality) and the internal state (e. g., phenotypic traits) of the focal organism. Identifying how these factors interact can reveal behavioral patterns that would otherwise go undiscovered. Given a large sample size of individuals (n = 187), we used acoustic biotelemetry to examine the spatial ecology of adfluvial bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus (Suckley, 1859)) in a large hydropower reservoir in British Columbia, Canada. Dependent variables, including home-range size and lateral movement, were analysed as a function of interactive relationships among seasons (over a 2-year period) and phenotypic traits. Mixed models indicated relationships between home-range size and season, whereas variation in lateral movement was explained by month and a two-way interaction between sex and body size. Large females (765 mm total length) were estimated to move laterally up to five times greater than females half their length, whereas movements between large and small males were not significantly different. This study shows how body size and sex can have a profound and possible interactive effect on animal movement. In addition, the results offer new information on the spatial ecology and conservation of adfluvial bull trout.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Gutowsky, Lee/0000-0003-1244-9465; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0008-4301	1480-3283				JAN	2016	94	1					31	40		10.1139/cjz-2015-0104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2015-0104													WOS:000370053700005

Canadian Coastal Seas and Great Lakes Sea Surface Temperature Climatology and Recent Trends	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												28years of satellite data were used to calculate sea surface temperature (SST) climatologies covering Canada's 3 surrounding oceans and the Great Lakes. Results show the imprint of major circulation features on the spatial distribution of the SST. Together with the Gulf Stream, the Labrador Current generates a strong spatial variability of SST on the east coast. Most of the Canadian Arctic, with the exception of Hudson Bay and the coastal Beaufort Sea region, is characterized by very small seasonal SST amplitude. Lake Erie is the water body having the largest seasonal SST amplitude, but for the oceanic regions, it is the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence and the adjacent Scotian Shelf.A trend analysis showed that many regions are undergoing rapid warming of the sea surface. However, warming is not spatially uniform. The strongest warming was detected in Baffin Bay and appears to result from the decreasing ice cover. Lake Superior is also showing a strong warming trend.These results have important implications for fisheries management because SST affects many species. Regions with small yearly amplitudes and warming trends might act as future cool water oases for some species.

In this study, the human and bovine schistosomiasis variations in the Dongting Lake region were studied from 1996 to 2010, and the relationships between schistosomiasis and water level were examined. Furthermore, based on these results, the potential effects of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on schistosomiasis were investigated. Results showed an increase in human schistosomiasis and in the scope of seriously affected regions, along with a decrease in bovine schistosomiasis. Human schistosomiasis was negatively correlated with water level during wet season (from May to October), particularly the average water level in October. This finding indicated that the decreasing water level may be highly related to the increasing of human schistosomiasis in the Dongting Lake region. Based on this result and the variation of schistosomiasis before and after the construction and operation of TGD, the impoundment of the Three Gorges reservoir is believed to decrease the water level and increase the contact between people and schistosomiasis. Therefore, the TGD, which is operated by regulating water and scheduling water operations, is not good for the control of human schistosomiasis in the Dongting Lake region. Although the extent of the influence of the TGD on schistosomiasis remains unclear, the influence of the TGD on preventing and controlling schistosomiasis should not be ignored.

SMUDGE PITS AND STONE "DRILLS": THE USE OF CHIPPED STONE TOOLS AT BURRELL ORCHARD	LITHIC TECHNOLOGY												Recent investigations by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History (CMNH) identified an extensive Late Archaic occupation at Burrell Orchard (33LN15), located on a promontory overlooking the Black River in northern Ohio. CMNH excavations have documented widespread midden deposits, prepared clay floors, post molds, and pit features including numerous smudge pits. The formal chipped stone tool assemblage is dominated by lanceolate projectile points and bifacial "drills." High-powered lithic microwear analysis was performed on.. formal chipped stone tools recovered from the 2008 and 2014 CMNH field seasons. Tool types examined included complete and fragmentary lanceolate points, drills, and other bifaces. The results indicate that many "drills" were actually used to perforate dry hide and, thus, may have held a unique place in the hide-processing activities conducted at the site.																			0197-7261	2051-6185					2016	41	2					164	178		10.1080/01977261.2016.1168145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01977261.2016.1168145													WOS:000376566700006

Quaternary Vegetation Changes in the Bonneville Basin	LAKE BONNEVILLE: A SCIENTIFIC UPDATE	Developments in Earth Surface Processes											Lake history and vegetation history complement each other in identifying key climate drivers of these interacting systems; for that reason comparing the two histories in the Bonneville basin has long held considerable research interest. Vegetation and constituent taxa respond to fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, seasonality, and other factors in a complex and mutually interactive interplay. Further complicating the interpretation of past vegetation patterns in relation to climatic factors are elements of considerable local climatic heterogeneity, differences in responses and spatiotemporal averaging of different proxy paleovegetation data sources, and chronometric uncertainties. Given these potential pitfalls, the fact that paleolake history-vegetation history comparisons work as well as they do is rather remarkable. Accommodating for complicating factors, long-term vegetation and hydrologic histories line up quite well through much of the Quaternary, and during the last glacial cycle in particular, on both orbital and millennial scales of climatic flux.																			0928-2025		978-0-444-63594-5; 978-0-444-63590-7				2016	20						420	441		10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00015-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63590-7.00015-9													WOS:000409050100017

This lake is located in a tropical region at high altitude and shows considerable seasonal variations (i.e., rainy and dry seasons). It has an area of 2.3 km(2) and a mean depth of 40.9 m. Alchichica is a warm monomictic lake, which annually becomes isothermal near the end of December or early January at the onset of the dry season and remains stratified for the rest of the year (from late March or early April to early December) during the warm-rainy season. Mathematical models of the spatial and temporal variation of passive substances in lakes and oceans require a quantitative formulation of the vertical transport. Vertical mixing is generally a function of the density profile, which, in lakes, can be directly related to the temperature profile. A widely used method to estimate the vertical diffusion coefficients in lakes from temperature data is the flux-gradient method. In the present study, we applied a simple approach to calculate the eddy diffusivity coefficient (K-z) based on the solution of the vertical component of the modeled temperature equation. We characterized the eddy diffusivity coefficient (Kz) in Lake Alchichica as a dynamic coefficient that changes during the year, between years, and with depth, ranging from 10(-10) to 10(-6) m(2) s(-1), whereas typical values of Kz in thermally stratified lakes range from 10(-9) to 10(-2) m(2) s(-1). As expected, we found the lowest values in the deeper regions of the lake, and that the temporal variation of temperature with depth showed a quasi-bimodal shape from one year to the next. We also found a structure of alternating peaks and troughs in the vertical Kz, which indicates a response to oscillating vertical mixing. We concluded that the solution of the vertical component of the temperature equation could be a useful tool to estimate the eddy diffusivity in lakes. The major advantage of this method is its simplicity. We also conclude that the differences observed in the estimations of eddy diffusivity coefficients in other lakes are attributable to the differences in local characteristics of the thermal conditions in each lake.

J	Ball, BA; Levy, J				Ball, Becky A.; Levy, Joseph			The role of water tracks in altering biotic and abiotic soil properties and processes in a polar desert in Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Groundwater discharge via water tracks is a largely unexplored passageway routing salts and moisture from high elevations to valley floors in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica. Given the influence that water tracks have on the distribution of liquid water in seasonally thawed Antarctic soils, it is surprising how little is known about their role in structuring biotic and abiotic processes this cold desert ecosystem. Particularly, it is unclear how soil biota will respond to the activation of new water tracks resulting from enhanced active layer thickening or enhanced regional snowmelt. In the MDV, water tracks are both wetter and more saline than the surrounding soils, constituting a change in soil habitat suitability for soil biology and therefore the ecological processes they carry out. To investigate the net impact that water tracks have on Dry Valley soil biology, and therefore the ecosystem processes for which they are responsible, we analyzed microbial biomass and activity in soils inside and outside of three water tracks and relate this to the physical soil characteristics. Overall, our results suggest that water tracks can significantly influence soil properties, which can further impact biological biovolume and both biotic and abiotic fluxes of CO2. However, the nature of its impact differs with water track, further suggesting that not all water tracks can be regarded the same.

J	Iverson, N; Person, M				Iverson, N.; Person, M.			Glacier-bed geomorphic processes and hydrologic conditions relevant to nuclear waste disposal	GEOFLUIDS												Characterizing glaciotectonic deformation, glacial erosion and sedimentation, and basal hydrologic conditions of ice sheets is vital for selecting sites for nuclear waste repositories at high latitudes. Glaciotectonic deformation is enhanced by excess pore pressures that commonly persist near ice sheet margins. Depths of such deformation can extend locally to a few tens of meters, with depths up to approximately 300 m in exceptional cases. Rates of glacial erosion are highly variable (0.0515 mm a-1), but rates <1 mm a-1 are expected in tectonically quiescent regions. Total erosion probably not exceeding several tens of meters is expected during a glacial cycle, although locally erosion could be greater. Consolidation of glacial sediments that is less than expected from independent estimates of glacier thickness indicates that heads at the bases of past ice sheets were usually within 30% of the floatation value. This conclusion is reinforced by direct measurements of water pressure beneath portions of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which indicate average heads <7 m below floatation. Landforms of the Laurentide and Scandinavian ice sheets and recent observations in Greenland indicate that high seasonal discharges of surface water are conducted to the bed, despite thick ice at subfreezing temperatures. Therefore, in models of subglacial groundwater flow used to assess sites for nuclear waste repositories, a flux upper boundary condition based on water input from only basal melting will be far more uncertain than applying a hydraulic head at the upper boundary set equal to a large fraction of the floatation value.																			1468-8115	1468-8123				FEB	2012	12	1			SI					10.1111/j.1468-8123.2011.00355.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-8123.2011.00355.x													WOS:000300687000004
J	Demko, TM; Currie, BS; Nicoll, KA				Demko, TM; Currie, BS; Nicoll, KA			Regional paleoclimatic and stratigraphic implications of paleosols and fluvial/overbank architecture in the Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic), Western Interior, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Paleosols in the Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic) from the Western Interior and Colorado Plateau regions occur in fluvial/overbank and marginal-lacustrine depositional facies associated with aggradational settings, and at sequence-bounding unconformities that mark divisions between major aggradational and degradational successions. Pedogenic features within these horizons preserve important contextual information about the local and regional paleoclimate and paleoenvironment in which the soils formed. Floodplain and lake-margin paleosols show evidence that most of the Morrison basin was characterized by a semi-arid to tropical wet-dry paleoclimate with fluctuating groundwater conditions, a low precipitation to evaporation ratio, and weak to moderately seasonal precipitation. Paleosol ichnofauna show evidence of a diverse and opportunistic flora and fauna that exploited changing conditions and existing nutrient and moisture regimes. Changes in paleosol type and degree of development over the basin indicate the overall regional paleoclimate was drier in the western and southern portions of the basin. Vertical trends indicate paleoclimatic conditions over the basin became steadily more humid through time. Laterally continuous, well-developed, deeply weathered paleosols formed during times of little or no deposition and mark regional unconformities. The paleosols at these sequence-bounding unconformities serve as useful regional stratigraphic markers to trace genetic packages across the Morrison depositional basin and to determine regional accommodation trends.

A 14,300-year-long record of fire-vegetation-climate linkages at Battle Ground Lake, southwestern Washington	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												High-resolution macroscopic charcoal analysis was used to reconstruct a 14,300-year-long Fire history record from the lower Columbia River Valley in southwestern Washington, which was compared to a previous vegetation reconstruction for the site. In the late-glacial period (ca. 14,300-13,100 cal yr BP), Pinus/Picea-dominated parkland supported little to no fire activity. From the late-glacial to the early Holocene (ca. 13,100-10,800 cal yr BP), Pseudotsuga/Abies-dominated forest featured more frequent fire episodes that burned mostly woody vegetation. In the early to middle Holocene (ca. 10,800-5200 cal yr BP), Quercus-dominated savanna was associated with frequent fire episodes of low-to-moderate severity, with art increased herbaceous (i.e., grass) charcoal content. From the middle to late Holocene (ca. 5200 cal yr BP to present), forest dominated by Pseudotsuga, Thuja-type, and Tsuga heterophylla supported less frequent, but mostly large or high-severity fire episodes. Fire episodes were least frequent, but were largest or most severe, after ca. 2500 cal yr BP. The fire history at Battle Ground Lake was apparently driven by climate, directly through the length and severity of the fire season, and indirectly through climate-driven vegetation shifts, which affected available fuel biomass.

We show the synergy using active and passive microwave observations available from the recent satellite altimetry missions (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, ENVISAT and Geosat Follow-On), cornplemented by the SSM/I passive data. We assess the applicability of altimetric and radiometric data for ice/water discrimination, and discuss the drawbacks and benefits of each type of sensor. An ice discrimination method, based on the combined use of the data from the four altimetric missions and SSM/I, is proposed and validated using available in situ observations and MODIS imagery. The method is applied to the entire satellite data set and used to define specific dates of ice events (first appearance of ice, formation of stable ice cover, first appearance of open water, complete disappearance of ice) and associated uncertainties. Using these satellite-derived estimates, we can extend the existing time series of ice events in the Southern Baikal up to 2004 and provide new information on the Middle and Northern Baikal, regions where no recent in situ ice cover observations are available. Our data show that over the last 10-15 years, trends towards earlier ice formation and later ice break-up result in a tendency for longer fast ice duration over the whole Lake Baikal. The methods proposed here have been tested for Lake Baikal, but they are applicable for other lakes and water bodies with seasonal ice cover. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A detailed point-based (n = 87) underwater vegetation survey was undertaken in the middle of the plant-growing season in July 2000. Then following plant die-back in November 2000, surface sediment samples (upper 1.5 cm) were collected from 30 of these plant survey points and analysed for plant macro-remains (all 30 samples), and pollen (4 evenly spaced samples). All data were stored as separate layers in a geographical information system and spatial relationships between the aquatic vegetation and plant remains were explored. In contrast to pollen types, plant macrofossils were not evenly dispersed across all parts of the lake and, with the exception of Chara oospores, higher concentrations of remains (particularly for Potamogeton) were found close to areas of source-plant dominance. The spatial pattern of macrophyte-macrofossil relationships revealed that vegetative remains (particularly leaf fragments) were probably deposited at source, whereas seeds were recovered close to the shore suggesting slightly wider dispersal. Overall, however, macro-remains best represented local 'Cypatch-scale' vegetation within 20-30 m of the core site. The macro-remains effectively recorded the dominant plants in the lake with 63% of samples containing a combination of remains of Chara, Elodea, and Potamogeton. However, relationships between macrophytes and fossils were complex. Some species were significantly over-represented by macrofossils (e.g., Chara spp., Nitella flexilis agg., and Zannichellia palustris), while others were either under-represented (e.g., Potamogeton spp.), or not represented at all (e.g., Lemna trisulca). Pollen represented macrophyte diversity poorly, but some taxa were found (e.g., Myriophyllum spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum) that were not recorded by macro-remains. We conclude that macrofossil analysis may be very usefully employed to determine the dominant taxa in past aquatic plant communities of shallow, productive lakes and that the addition of pollen analysis provides further information on former species richness.

To reconstruct Yedoma IC formation in Central Yakutia, we analyzed the geochemistry, sedimentology, and stratigraphy of thawed and frozen deposits below two thermokarst lakes in different evolutionary stages (a mature alas lake and a initial Yedoma lake) from the Yukechi site in the Lena-Aldan interfluve. We focused on inorganic geochemical characteristics and mineral weathering in two similar to 17 m long sediment cores to trace syngenetic permafrost aggradation and degradation over time. Geochemical properties, element ratios, and specific weathering indices reflect varying sedimentation processes and seasonal thaw depths under variable environmental conditions. Deeper thaw during the interstadial Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 enabled increasing mineral weathering and initial thermokarst processes. Sedimentological proxies reflect high transport energy and short transport paths and mainly terrestrial sediment supply. The Yedoma formation resulted from fluvial, alluvial and aeolian processes. Low mean TOC contents in both cores contrast with Yedoma deposits elsewhere. Likely, this is a result of the very low organic matter content of the source material of the Yukechi Yedoma. Pronounced cryostructures and strongly depleted pore water stable isotopes show a perennially frozen state and preserved organic matter for the lower part of the Yedoma lake core, while changing permafrost conditions, conditions promoting weathering, and strong organic matter decomposition are suggested by our proxies for its middle and upper parts. For the alas lake core, less depleted water stable isotopes reflect the influence of recent precipitation, i.e. the infiltration of rain and lake water into the unfrozen ground. The FENG, MIA(R), and ICV weathering indices have proven to be promising proxies for the identification of conditions that promote mineral weathering to different degrees in the stratigraphy of the thawed and frozen Yedoma deposits, for which we assume a rather homogeneous chemical composition of the parent material.

J	Cho, JH; Lee, JH				Cho, Jae Heon; Lee, Jong Ho			Stormwater Runoff Characteristics and Effective Management of Nonpoint Source Pollutants from a Highland Agricultural Region in the Lake Soyang Watershed	WATER												The dense highland field area in the upstream region of the Lake Soyang watershed is subject to excessive soil erosion during the wet season. In this study, stormwater runoff from the Lake Soyang watershed was monitored during four rainfall events at 10 locations throughout 2016. The maximum SS concentration at Naedongcheon, which is located in the upper part of the Soyang River, reached 4598 mg/L. The event mean concentration (EMC) of SS loads in Naedongcheon ranged from 82.2 mg/L to 926.3 mg/L. We found that, although the first flush events were usually concentrated in highly paved urban areas, a first flush occurred in the agricultural area of the dense highland field region. The first flush phenomenon was identified by a dimensionless cumulative runoff mass and volume curve (M(V) curve), and the intensity of the first flush was analyzed by the coefficient of the nonlinear regression model and the FF30 and FF25 values (the fraction of pollution load transported by the first 30% and 25% of runoff, respectively). Nonlinear regression models using the power function were applied to fit the M(V) curve, the FF30 values were inversely proportional to the coefficient a of the regression model. A long-term seasonal trend decomposition for monthly turbidity and precipitation was performed for the Lake Soyang. Long-term turbidity trend was approximately coincident with the trend in long-term precipitation. In addition, the present status of the best management practices (BMPs) in the upper part of the Soyang River basin was investigated, and a survey of the management and operation of the BMPs was conducted for selected farmers.																			2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							784	10.3390/w9100784	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9100784													WOS:000414707500061

The ostracod assemblage of this basin includes 10 species belonging to 5 genera: Cypridea cf. changluensis, C. cf. subprognata, C. sp., Mongolocypris sp. 1, M. sp. 2, Candona cf. arcinaeformis, C. sp. 1, C. sp. 2, Mantelliana sp. and Timiriasevia sp. Among these, genera Mantelliana and Timiriasevia are the first records in South Korea. Also, the occurrence of the genus Timiriasevia suggests that the paleoenvironment of the lake in the Hampyeong Basin was influenced by seasonal changes. Based on the ostracod assemblage, the age of this basin is considered as Aptian-Albian stages.

With the combined drivers of climate change and human activities, eutrophication has expanded from warm shallow lakes to cold-water lakes in relatively high latitude regions and has raised greater concerns over lake aquatic ecosystem health. A two-year field study was carried out to investigate water quality, phytoplankton characteristics and eutrophication status in a typical alpine glacial lake of Tianchi, a scenic area and an important drinking water source in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, in 2014 and 2015. Clear seasonal and annual variations of nutrients and organic pollutants were found especially during rainy seasons. For the phytoplankton community, Bacillariophyta held the dominant position in terms of both species and biomass throughout the year, suggesting the dominant characteristics of diatoms in the phytoplankton structure in such a high-altitude cold-water lake. This was quite different from plain and warm lakes troubled with cyanobacterial blooming. Moreover, the dominant abundance of Cyclotella sp. in Tianchi might suggest regional warming caused by climate change, which might have profound effects on the local ecosystems and hydrological cycle. Based on water quality parameters, a comprehensive trophic level index TLI (Sigma) was calculated to estimate the current status of eutrophication, and the results inferred emerging eutrophication in Tianchi. Results from Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and correlation analysis of phytoplankton genera and physico-chemical variables of water indicated that abiotic factors significantly influenced the phytoplankton community and its succession in Tianchi Lake. These abiotic factors could explain 77.82% of the total variance, and ammonium was identified as the most discriminant variable, which could explain 41% of the total variance followed by TP (29%). An estimation of annual nutrient loadings to Tianchi was made, and the results indicated that about 212.97 t of total nitrogen and 32.14 t of total phosphorus were transported into Tianchi Lake annually. Human socio-economic activities (runoff caused by historical overgrazing and increasing tourism) were identified as the most important contributors to Tianchi nutrient loadings.

The results indicate that the physical characteristics of the water (temperature and salinity) were quite similar over the years. Nutrients, which were concentrated in pond A1, decreased with increases in salt concentration. The composition of the phytoplankton community showed strong seasonality. Diatoms dominated in the first ponds A1, A16 and C2-1, followed by dinoflagellates. Chlorophyceae dominated the phytoplankton community in the hypersaline ponds M2 and TS. Cyanobacteriae were relatively abundant in ponds M2 and TS. The highest phytoplankton density and biomass were found in the ponds with the highest salinity due to the proliferation of Dunaliella salina (Chlorophyta: Volvocales). The inter-annual study of phytoplankton succession in the Sfax solar salterns showed slight differences among the years of study due to the stability of the environmental conditions. Phytoplankton communities were permanently primitive, stage 1 structured as they failed to build complexity because of salt stress which operates for longer and above any other variables. This reduced frequency of disturbance to the existing course of regulation, allowed the community to "mature" from its "primitive" state, rather than experience frequent structural setbacks.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Shallow lentic aquatic ecosystems, such as ponds, are important repositories of carbon (C) and hotspots of C cycling and greenhouse gas emission. Tube-dwelling benthic invertebrates, such as chironomids, may be key players in C dynamics in these water bodies, yet their role in the C-budget at ecosystem level remains unclear. We tested whether a 41 % reduction in chironomid abundance after application of the mosquito control biocide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) had implications for the C-fluxes to the atmosphere, C-pools, and C-transformation (i.e. organic matter decomposition) in ponds. Data were collected over one year in the shallow, deep and riparian zones of 12 experimental floodplain pond mesocosms (FPMs), half of them treated with Bti. C-fluxes were measured as CO2 and CH4 emissions, atmospheric deposition, and emerging insects. C-pools were measured as dissolved inorganic and organic C in surface and porewater, sediment organic C, C in plant and in macroinvertebrate biomass. Despite seasonal variability, treated FPMs, for which higher CH4 emissions have been reported, showed a trend towards less dissolved organic C in porewater, while no effect was observed for all remaining components of the C-budget. We attribute the effect of Bti on the C-budget to the reduction in macroinvertebrates biomass, the increase in CH4 emissions, and the input of C from the Bti excipients. This finding suggests that changes in tube-dwelling macroinvertebrates have a weak influence on C cycling in ponds and confirms the existence of long-lasting effects of Bti on specific components of C-budgets.

Species compositions and seasonal variations of TCB in reservoirs depend on interactions between physical and chemical factors. This study was conducted to evaluate the water quality in the Aha Reservoir, Southwest China, focusing on cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. Water samples were collected weekly or biweekly from May to September of 2015 and used to delineate temporal variations in density and distribution of toxic cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in the reservoir. Toxic cyanobacteria identified consisted of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Pseudanabaena limnetica, Cylindrospermopsis sp., and Microcystis sp., with Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Pseudanabaena limnetica being the most common and significant toxic genera. The total biomass of cyanobacteria was 17.0 mg/L. Identification and quantification of microcystin variants were conducted by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a system equipped with a photodiode array detector. Microcystin levels were between 0-3.0 mu g/L, MC-RR was around 0-3.0 mu g/L and MC-LR was approximately 0-0.9 mu g/L. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the investigated reservoirs should be monitored regularly to minimize potential health risks to the human population.					jiang, fan/KHV-8640-2024														2096-5508					JUL	2018	36	4					1126	1131		10.1007/s00343-018-7178-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-018-7178-6													WOS:000441231100010
J	Means, MM; Ahn, C; Noe, GB				Means, Mary M.; Ahn, Changwoo; Noe, Gregory B.			Planting richness affects the recovery of vegetation and soil processes in constructed wetlands following disturbance	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The resilience of constructed wetland ecosystems to severe disturbance, such as a mass herbivory eat-out or soil disturbance, remains poorly understood. In this study, we use a controlled mesocosm experiment to examine how original planting diversity affects the ability of constructed freshwater wetlands to recover structurally and functionally after a disturbance (i.e., aboveground harvesting and soil coring). We assessed if the planting richness of macrophyte species influences recovery of constructed wetlands one year after a disturbance. Mesocosms were planted in richness groups with various combinations of either 1, 2, 3, or 4 species (RG 1-4) to create a gradient of richness. Structural wetland traits measured include morphological regrowth of macro-phytes, soil bulk density, soil moisture, soil %C, and soil %N. Functional wetland traits measured include above ground biomass production, soil potential denitrification, and soil potential microbial respiration. Total mesocosm cover increased along the gradient of plant richness (43.5% in RG 1 to 84.5% in RG 4) in the growing season after the disturbance, although not all planted individuals recovered. This was largely attributed to the dominance of the obligate annual species. The morphology of each species was affected negatively by the disturbance, producing shorter, and fewer stems than in the years prior to the disturbance, suggesting that the communities had not fully recovered one year after the disturbance. Soil characteristics were almost uniform across the planting richness gradient, but for a few exceptions (%C, C: N, and non-growing season soil moisture were higher slightly in RG 2). Denitrification potential (DEA) increased with increasing planting richness and was influenced by the abundance and quality of soil C. Increased open space in unplanted mesocosms and mesocosms with lower species richness increased labile C, leading to higher C mineralization rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Burnt bones by Europe's largest lake: Zooarchaeology of the Stone Age and Early Metal period hunter-gatherers at Lake Ladoga, NW Russia	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												Lake Ladoga, Europe's largest lake, is situated in northwest Russia east of the Baltic Sea. This article is the first compilation of all the zooarchaeological material recovered from the Stone Age and Early Metal Period hunter-gatherer sites in the area analysed and published up to 2014. All the faunal remains preserved in the acidic soils are small pieces of calcined bone, except for two sites where anaerobic conditions have also preserved un-burnt bones. An overview of the analysed assemblages, including identified species and carcass treatment is presented, and the chronological trends briefly summarised. Based on the zooarchaeological material the prehistoric subsistence base was aquatically oriented throughout the Stone Age and Early Metal Period. Day-to-day subsistence seems based on fishing near the campsites, supplemented with seasonal food sources. Prehistoric inhabitants of Lake Ladoga were also committed to invest technology, time, and human resources in the specialised, risky sealing forays. The abundant lake resources offered a stable, self-renewing resource base for the area's population and, for example, fishing maintained its importance in subsistence even after the introduction of cultivation - in places into the 20th century.

However, relevant molecular evidences are still lacking. Fas-signaling pathway plays a key role in toxicant-induced germ cell apoptosis. This study was to evaluate the responses of Fas/FasL system related genes and proteins in testes of rats injected intravenously with MCs. Enhanced apoptosis of germ cells in the testes of MCs-treated rats was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxy-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) associated with up-regulation of the Fas/FasL system. Both Fas and FasL protein expression were induced evidently from I h post-injection, and this high expression level maintained throughout the experiment. In addition, the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 protein was also observed, which were indicators of apoptosis. These results suggested the likely involvement of Fas/FasL system in the MCs-induced germ cell apoptosis. It is also suggested that MCs can cause damage to Sertoli cells directly.

For this purpose, from April to August 2005, T. natans production, dissolved O-2, CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the water column and CO2 and CH4 fluxes across the water-atmosphere interface were measured in an oxbow lake (Lanca di Po, Northern Italy) where a monospecific floating mat of water chestnut develops. Net primary production by T. natans was determined via biomass harvesting while gas fluxes were determined via short-term incubations of light and dark floating chambers. From July onwards, when the water surface of the oxbow lake was entirely colonized by the plant, the dense canopy resulted in a physical barrier for light and water reareation. As a consequence of sediment and plant respiration, persistent hypoxia and often anoxia, and CO2 and CH4 supersaturation occurred in the water column. Net primary production of T. natans, calculated at peak biomass, was 13.05 +/- 0.32 mol CO2 m(-2). The T. natans mat was,a net sink for atmospheric CO2 from mid June to mid August, with an uptake peak measured at the beginning of July (229 mmol m(-2) d(-1)): estimated net ecosystem metabolism was <= 10.09 +/- 1.90 mol CO2 m(-2). Contextually, during the vegetative period of T. natans, the oxbow lake was a net source of methane (9.52 +/- 2.10 mol m(-2)), and the resulting CH4 to CO2 flux ratio across the water-atmosphere interface was >= 0.94. The large methane release was probably due to the persistent hypoxia and anoxia induced by the T. natans meadow, which uncoupled methane production from methane oxidation.					bartoli, marco/E-5321-2017; Viaroli, Pierluigi/M-3762-2014; Bartoli, Marco/E-5321-2017; Bolpagni, Rossano/Q-7053-2018	bartoli, marco/0000-0002-5022-6206; Viaroli, Pierluigi/0000-0002-6396-2894; Bolpagni, Rossano/0000-0001-9283-2821													1129-5767	1723-8633					2010	69	2					225	234		10.4081/jlimnol.2010.225	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2010.225													WOS:000282859700005

We found a 2-phase (warm season, >25 degrees C [June to October] and cold season, < 25 degrees C [November to May]) seasonal cycle with a 10-fold variation in the growth of bacteria (heterotrophic bacteria only) and picophytoplankton, primarily coccoid cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.), and nanoflagellate grazing rates upon them. Growth rate in bacteria and Synechococcus spp. appeared to be affected by changes in temperature, and the nanoflagellate grazing rate was controlled by concentrations of bacteria and Synechococcus spp. The seasonal cycles of abundance in bacteria and Synechococcus spp. were a reflection of their changing net growth rates (i.e. picoplankton growth rates - nanoflagellate grazing rates), which were highest at the beginning of the warm season. During the warm season, nanoflagellates consumed an equal amount of bacteria and Synechococcus spp.; therefore, growth in both groups was affected equally by grazing in the warm season. However, during the cold season, bacteria contributed more to nanoflagellate carbon consumed than did Synechococcus spp. because the growth rate of Synechococcus spp. was low. We conclude that during the warm season a significant part of bacteria and Synechococcus spp. carbon is channeled through the microbial loop, possibly making it an important link between primary production and higher trophic levels.

Beyond macronutrients: element variability and multielement stoichiometry in freshwater invertebrates	ECOLOGY LETTERS												We contrasted concentrations of macronutrients (C, N and P), essential (As, Cu, Zn and Se) and non-essential metals (Pb, Hg and Cd) in invertebrates across five lakes and June to October in one lake. We predicted that somatic concentrations of tightly regulated elements would be less variable than weakly and unregulated elements. Within each taxon, variation was lowest in macronutrients, intermediate in essential micronutrients, and highest in non-essential metals, which corresponded in rank to homeostatic regulation strength for the same elements calculated from the literature. Hence, homeostatic regulation may strongly influence variation in element concentrations of biota in situ. Of the individual elements, only taxonomic differences in C and N were consistent across lakes and over a season. Nevertheless, canonical discriminant analyses successfully discriminated among taxa based on taxonomic multielement composition. Thus, relative taxonomic differences in multielement composition appear more informative than absolute stoichiometric formulae when considering the role of inherently variable trace elements in ecological investigations.

In this study, we compared the effects of a simulated territory intrusion (a method for testing the Challenge Hypothesis) Oil males and Females of the fish, Neolamprologus pulcher This cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika is a particularly useful species to examine sex differences in the behavioral mediation of hormones as breeding pairs remain in a territory year round and both sexes defend this territory against conspecific and heterospecific intruders. In our study, both sexes indeed aggressively defended their territory against a simulated territory intruder. In response to intruders, both males and females displayed elevated levels of circulating 11-ketotestosterone, but only females exhibited increases in testosterone. Neither aggressing male nor female fish showed changes in estradiol levels compared to Control (nonaggressing) fish. Residents were more aggressive than the intruders and won most of the interactions. However, residents (or winners) did not show higher hormone levels than intruders (or losers). We suggest that aggression commonly modulates androgen levels in both male and female teleost fish.

Morphology, Formation, and Activity of Three Different Pockmark Systems in Peri-Alpine Lake Thun, Switzerland	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Pockmarks are crater-like depressions formed by upward fluid flow (gas and/or liquid) through the unconsolidated sediment column on the floor of oceans and lakes. While pockmarks are well described in the marine realm, they have essentially been overlooked in lacustrine settings, likely due to a lack in economic interest to apply high-resolution hydroacoustic techniques in lakes. A swath-bathymetry survey on Lake Thun, Switzerland, revealed the existence of three pockmark systems. One pockmark (110 m in diameter) was discovered near a big karst system at Beatenberg at a water depth of similar to 217 m. Its activity is probably associated with episodic groundwater seepage induced by earthquakes, floods and snowmelt. At another site, Daerligen, we detected at similar to 60 m water depth the presence of multiple smaller pockmarks (similar to 1.5 to 10 m in diameter) that seem to be active, continuously liberating CH4 gas by bubble ebullition. The CH4 displayed a biogenic carbon isotopic signature, however, the exact origin of the gas remains unknown. The third site, Tannmoos (similar to 35 m water depth), comprises two large pockmarks (20-43 m in diameter) connected to a karst system in gypsum-carrying bedrock. One of these pockmarks is constituted of several unit pockmarks (e.g., sub-pockmarks; 0.3 to 0.8 m in diameter). While strong evidence is still lacking, we suggest that groundwater discharge occasionally occurs through these unit pockmarks during periods of intense precipitation. Hence, this study reveals the existence of three pockmark systems of variable morphology and mechanisms of formation within the same lake, reflecting different hydrological and biogeochemical regimes. Moreover, it underscores the potential importance of pockmarks in influencing hydrological and CH4 budgets in lakes. Clearly more work on quantifying seasonal fluxes of groundwater and CH4 release via lacustrine pockmarks is required, and it needs to be seen whether the observations made in Lake Thun are universal and apply also to many other lacustrine environments worldwide.

Recent PMs increase due to the drying of Urmia Lake remains a major health challenge in the west of Iran. This study was conducted to assess the correlation of the exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 on respiratory hospitalization in Urmia, Iran. Daily hospital admissions and air pollutants data were collected during the study period. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the risks of hospitalization in exposure to PMs. There was a significant adverse effect between PM10 and asthma hospitalization based on the adjusted and unadjusted models. In the adjusted model, an interquartile range (IQR) increment of PM10 and PM2.5 increased the risk of admissions for asthma by [1.124 (1.062-1.191)] and [1.117 (1.055-1.184)], respectively. The estimated odds ratio for females was 1.5 times higher than males. A comparison of the associated risks of PM2.5 indicates a significant increase in the group aged 18-60 and >60 years. Not including asthma, a significant correlation was found between all causes of hospitalization and exposure to PM2.5 during cold seasons. Taken together, the results provide important insights into that exposure to ambient PMs were associated with an increased risk of respiratory hospitalization.					; Benis, Khaled/AAM-1241-2021; Jafarabadi, Mohammmad/A-7478-2017; Asghari Jafarabadi, Mohammmad/A-7478-2017; , Mohammad/E-1108-2017	Sabeti, Zahra/0000-0003-1651-6100; Zoroufchi benis, Khaled/0000-0003-3532-6839; Asghari Jafarabadi, Mohammmad/0000-0003-3284-9749; 													1080-7039	1549-7860				SEP 10	2021	27	8					2184	2201		10.1080/10807039.2021.1964064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2021.1964064		AUG 2021											WOS:000685328300001

Behavioural and population responses to changing availability of Artemia prey by moulting black-necked grebes, Podiceps nigricollis	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We examined how availability of brine shrimps, Artemia parthenogenetica, influenced temporal aspects of foraging behaviour and population dynamics of moulting black-necked grebes, Podiceps nigricollis, from late August to early December in four salt ponds in the Odiel marshes, southern Spain, in 2008 and 2009. The moulting grebe population was higher in 2009, coinciding with an increase in shrimp biomass, with a peak of 2,500 birds in October. Grebes increased their time spent foraging as the season progressed, coinciding with decreases in shrimp biomass and water temperature. Foraging activity was lower in 2009, when shrimp biomass was greater. Diving was the most frequent feeding method, especially as the season progressed. Brine shrimps at the bottom of the water column were larger than those near the surface. Differences between years in grebe body mass suggest that changing shrimp availability and water temperature had an influence on body condition. The grebe population consumed an estimated 0.2-2.0% of the standing crop of Artemia per day, with this fraction increasing as the season progresses, thus contributing to the decline in the Artemia population. Our results suggest that moulting grebes are probably only able to adjust foraging effort within certain limits, especially at the end of moulting period when thermal stress is greatest and food supply is lowest. They may leave the study area when they can no longer meet their energy requirements.

Sediment heavy metal pollution status and potential health risk assessment of the Akyatan Lagoon were determined from the seasonally obtained sediment samples between January 2022 and October 2022. The heavy metal concentrations in surface sediments of the Akyatan Lagoon ranged between 25.73 and 70.87 g/kg for Al, 10.28-31.03 mg/kg for Co, 0.11-1.42 mg/kg for Cd, 56.22-181.64 mg/kg for Cr, 10.06-34.16 mg/kg for Cu, 13.94-43.39 g/kg for Fe, 361.45-1118.82 mg/kg for Mn, 61.53-209.42 mg/kg for Ni, 9.46-34.43 mg/kg for Pb, and 19.57-117.42 mg/kg for Zn, respectively. The calculated ecological risk indices showed moderate Co, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb contamination for surface sediments of the Akyatan Lagoon. Additionally, the study results indicated that the calculated hazard index (HI) values ranged from 1.32E-04-1.87E+ 00 whilst the calculated Total Lifetime Cancer Risk (TLCR) values ranged between 1.19E-07 and 3.26E-03 for the adults and children with the higher values calculated for the children, showing a higher potential health hazards for the children. Our study also indicated significant health hazards for children and adults from the carcinogenic Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Pb in the Akyatan Lagoon.

Estuarine freshwater wetlands face unique challenges from fluctuating water levels, which influence water quality, vegetation, and carbon cycling. However, the response of CH4 fluxes and their drivers to altered hydrology and vegetation remains unclear, hindering mechanistic modeling. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied an estuarine freshwater wetland in the Great Lakes region, where rising water levels led to a vegetation shift from emergent Typha dominance in 2015-2016 to floating-leaved species in 2020-2022. Using eddy covariance flux measurements during the peak growing season (June-September) of both periods, we observed a 60% decrease in CH4 emissions, from 81 +/- 4 g C m-2 in 2015-2016 to 31 +/- 3 g C m-2 in 2020-2022. This decline was driven by two main factors: (1) higher water levels, which suppressed ebullitive fluxes via increased hydrostatic pressure and extended CH4 residence time, enhancing oxidation potential in the water column; and (2) reduced CH4 conductance through plants. Net carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake decreased by 90%, from -267 +/- 26 g C m-2 in 2015-2016 to -27 +/- 49 g C m-2 in 2020-2022. Additionally, diel CH4 flux patterns shifted, with a distinct morning peak observed in 2015-2016 but absent in 2020-2022, suggesting changes in plant-mediated transport and a potential decoupling from photosynthesis. The dominant factors influencing CH4 fluxes shifted from water temperature and gross primary productivity in 2015-2016 to atmospheric pressure in 2020-2022, suggesting an increased role of ebullition as a primary transport pathway. Our results demonstrate that changes in water levels and vegetation can substantially alter CH4 and CO2 fluxes in coastal freshwater wetlands, underscoring the critical role of hydrological shifts in driving carbon dynamics in these ecosystems.

Reinforcement Learning of Multi-Timescale Forecast Information for Designing Operating Policies of Multi-Purpose Reservoirs	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hydrological forecasts have significantly improved in skill over recent years, encouraging their systematic exploitation in multipurpose reservoir operations to improve reliability and resilience to extreme events. Despite the growing availability of multi-timescale forecasts, there is still a lack of transparent and integrated methods for selecting the most suitable forecast products, variables, and lead times for specific operational challenges. In this work, we propose a holistic approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to design multipurpose dam operating policies informed by available multi-timescale forecast products. Our approach extends the traditional Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search method by parametrizing both the operating policy and the forecast information extraction process. We compare our RL approach with a state-of-the-art two-step procedure in which the forecast selection and processing are performed before the policy optimization. We demonstrate the value of the method for the multipurpose operation of Lake Como (Italy) by considering multi-timescale forecasts from short to seasonal lead times to manage flood- and drought-related operational objectives. Our approach identifies solutions achieving an 18% improvement in hypervolume indicator compared to policies not informed by forecasts and a 6% improvement over those designed using the two-step reference methodology. These improvements are accompanied by increased flexibility in policy design and trade-off analysis by directly extracting forecast information within the multi-objective optimization. This study demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of integrating policy design with forecast information extraction, particularly when multiple operational forecasts are available.					; Ficchi, Andrea/GVS-7781-2022; Castelletti, Annalisa/MCJ-2389-2025	Ficchi, Andrea/0000-0001-5630-7069; Giuliani, Matteo/0000-0002-4780-9347; Castelletti, Andrea/0000-0002-7923-1498; Zanutto, Dennis/0000-0002-1997-3350													0043-1397	1944-7973				FEB	2025	61	2							e2023WR036724	10.1029/2023WR036724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR036724													WOS:001418138700001

However, the occurrence of antibiotics and ARGs under different modes and stages of aquaculture has rarely been systematically studied.Methods This paper uses qPCR, LC-MS, and High-Throughput sequencing across different culture modes and stages to investigate antibiotics, resistance genes, and microbial communities in the water bodies, and analyze contamination differences between these modes.Results The quinolone and chloramphenicol were the main antibiotics, and the highest absolute abundance genes were quinolone resistance genes (qnrB) and quinolone resistance genes (sul1), with the mobile genetic element (MGE) intI1, both of which exhibited a gradual seasonal increase. Microbial diversity also varies seasonally, especially with a gradual increase in the abundance of some pathogenic bacteria (Flavobacterium). Antibiotics and resistance genes were found at higher levels in fish ponds compared to shrimp and crab ponds, while they were lower in shrimp and crab ponds that utilized the ecological mode ponds than in the traditional culture mode ponds.Conclusion Our study presents a comprehensive characterization of antibiotics and ARGs in aquaculture waters from various perspectives. Ecological aquaculture modes contribute to reducing antibiotic and resistance gene pollution in water bodies. These findings will support the optimization of aquaculture mode and antibiotic usage to the green and sustainable development of aquaculture finally.

Ecological successions throughout the desiccation of Tirez lagoon (Spain) as an astrobiological time-analog for wet-to-dry transitions on Mars	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Tirez was a small and seasonal endorheic athalassohaline lagoon that was located in central Spain. In recent years, the lagoon has totally dried out, offering for the first time the opportunity to analyze its desiccation process as a "time-analog" to similar events occurred in paleolakes with varying salinity during the wet-to-dry transition on early Mars. On the martian cratered highlands, an early period of water ponding within enclosed basins evolved to a complete desiccation of the lakes, leading to deposition of evaporitic sequences during the Noachian and into the Late Hesperian. As Tirez also underwent a process of desiccation, here we describe (i) the microbial ecology of Tirez when the lagoon was still active 20 years ago, with prokaryotes adapted to extreme saline conditions; (ii) the composition of the microbial community in the dried lake sediments today, in many case groups that thrive in sediments of extreme environments; and (iii) the molecular and isotopic analysis of the lipid biomarkers that can be recovered from the sediments today. We discuss the implications of these results to better understanding the ecology of possible Martian microbial communities during the wet-to-dry transition at the end of the Hesperian, and how they may inform about research strategies to search for possible biomarkers in Mars after all the water was lost.

Settling techniques have some potential ability to remove pollutants from Lake water. To assess its performance potential, pilot modified settling techniques (PMSTs) were built and monitored seasonally in triplicate to estimate changes in physicochemical properties and microbial community for influent water from Marriott Lake in Egypt. The experimental design included units with different operating conditions of settling techniques, namely, Control, (combination tank), (Air + gravel), (No air + gravel), and (Air). Each unit represents one operational condition. The PMSTs were operated under seasonal variation and hydraulic retention time (HRT 1-9 days). The concentration variations and removal rates of different pollutants including; Turbidity, DO, BOD5, NH4-N, NO3-N, NO2, TN, and TP were measured in different settling units. To obtain optimum operating conditions of PMSTs, the average removal percent of the studied pollutants in different settling units was measured. The maximum performance was achieved by (No air + Gravel) unit. PMSTs have significant potential and could be widely used as a pre-treatment step for other water treatment techniques or directly for other purposes.					; Aboagye, Dominic/AAA-1524-2021; barakat, khouloud/AAC-9770-2020; Gaballah, Mohamed S./A-9579-2019; Gaballah, Mohamed/IUQ-6313-2023	Abdelwahab, Ola/0000-0001-8451-7987; Aboagye, Dominic/0000-0003-1504-9010; Gaballah, Mohamed S./0000-0002-6064-5631; barakat, khouloud/0000-0002-4133-2058													2214-7144					AUG	2021	42								101985	10.1016/j.jwpe.2021.101985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2021.101985													WOS:000681176400006

Assessment of Different Water Use Efficiency Calculations for Dominant Forage Crops in the Great Lakes Basin	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Water use efficiency (WUE) can be calculated using a range of methods differing in carbon uptake and water use variable selection. Consequently, inconsistencies arise between WUE calculations due to complex physical and physiological interactions. The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare WUE estimates (harvest or flux-based) for alfalfa (C-3 plant) and maize (C-4 plant) and determine effects of input variables, plant physiology and farming practices on estimates. Four WUE calculations were investigated: two "harvest-based" methods, using above ground carbon content and either precipitation or evapotranspiration (ET), and two "flux-based" methods, using gross primary productivity (GPP) and either ET or transpiration. WUE estimates differed based on method used at both half-hourly and seasonal scales. Input variables used in calculations affected WUE estimates, and plant physiology led to different responses in carbon assimilation and water use variables. WUE estimates were also impacted by different plant physiological responses and processing methods, even when the same carbon assimilation and water use variables were considered. This study highlights a need to develop a metric of measuring cropland carbon-water coupling that accounts for all water use components, plant carbon responses, and biomass production.					de Haan, Kevin/AAG-6766-2021; Macrae, Merrin/KPB-7902-2024	Helgason, Warren/0000-0002-7068-5717; Macrae, Merrin/0000-0003-3296-3103														2077-0472				AUG	2021	11	8							739	10.3390/agriculture11080739	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11080739													WOS:000688733000001

A bog-poor fen-upland system was instrumented near Mariana Lakes (ML) (55.899 degrees N, 112.090 degrees W) and a rich fen-upland system was instrumented at JPH (57.122 degrees N, 111.444 degrees W), 100 km south and 45 km north of Fort McMurray, Alberta respectively. LiDAR surveys were initially conducted to delineate the watershed boundaries and topography and to select a range of specific locations for the installation of water table wells and groundwater piezometers. Field work, which included a range of physical measurements as well as water sampling for geochemical and isotopic characterization, was carried out mainly during the thaw seasons of 2011 to 2015. From analysis of the runoff response and nitrogen species abundances we estimate that nitrogen exchange between the wetlands and adjacent terrain units ranged between 2.2 and -3.1 kg/ha/year for rich fens, 0.6 to -1.1 kg/ha/year for poor fens, and between 0.6 and -2.5 kg/ha/year for bogs, predominantly via surface pathways and in the form of dissolved nitrate. A significant storage of dissolved ammonium (and also dissolved organic nitrogen) was found within the pore water of the bog-fen complex at Mariana Lakes, which we attribute to decomposition, although it is likely immobile under current hydrologic conditions, as suggested by tritium distributions. In comparison with the experimental loads of between 5 and 25 kg/ha/year, the potential nitrogen exchange with adjacent terrain units is expected to have only a minor or negligible influence, and is therefore of secondary importance for defining critical loads across the regional landscape. Climate change and development impacts may lead to significant mobilization of nitrogen storages, although more research is required to quantify the potential effects on local ecosystems.					; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009	Cherry, Mikaela/0000-0003-1081-0296; Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228; Birks, Sandra/0000-0003-0970-682X; 														2073-4441				AUG	2021	13	16							2204	10.3390/w13162204	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13162204													WOS:000690047600001

Results show that the evolution of vertical ground deformation is modulated elastically by the reservoir operation, whereas the horizontal displacement measured near the reservoir exhibits a time lag of similar to 65 days with respect to the vertical displacements and water-level variations. The delayed deformation transients indicate that the reservoir loading/unloading cycles affect the near-surface hydrology in its neighborhood. The broader distribution and higher amplitude of ground deformation during the loading periods revealed by the InSAR time series can be explained by water-rock interactions, which cause a decrease in the effective Young's modulus within the top 300-m crustal layer. Our results demonstrate the potential of using space geodetic data to ensure a better understanding of the solid Earth response to regional hydrological changes. Plain Language Summary The seasonal variations of water storage in the reservoir alter the stress state and hydrologic loadings in the neighboring region thereby may bring measurable crust deformation at the lakeshore. Recent studies have worked to capture the long-term deformation signals near the reservoirs and lakes, but seldom of them has considered the localized crust behavior on a seasonal scale. To better understand crust deformation processes from this anthropogenic source, we used multiple space geodetic observations, in-situ data, elastic and poroelastic models to study the Tehri reservoir, India. The results show that the similar to 80 m water loading cycles modulate the elastic deformation close to the reservoir. An asymmetric crustal deformation with higher amplitude and broader impacted area in the loading scenario, providing a possible weakening effect in the fractured shallow crustal medium from the water-rock interaction. While the elastic deformation in the vertical direction is well explained, more complicated horizontal motions may be connected to the local hydrologic conditions.					; Gahalaut, Vineet/AGK-5873-2022; Ding, Xiaoli/K-4596-2013; Xie, Lei/HJY-6928-2023; Xu, Wenbin/E-8492-2017; Burgmann, Roland/AAE-5138-2022; Xu, Wenbin/AAQ-2672-2021	Burgmann, Roland/0000-0002-3560-044X; Ding, Xiaoli/0000-0002-5733-3629; Gahalaut, Vineet/0000-0003-2514-4644; Xie, Lei/0000-0003-0398-1476; Xu, Wenbin/0000-0001-7294-8229; 													2169-9313	2169-9356				AUG	2021	126	8							e2020JB021122	10.1029/2020JB021122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB021122													WOS:000691015100032

North Atlantic marine sediment cores show comparable variability in sea surface temperature and the deposition of ice-rafted debris(3-5). In contrast, very few continental records of this time period provide the temporal resolution and environmental sensitivity necessary to reveal the extent and effects of these environmental fluctuations on the continents. Here we present high-resolution geochemical, physical and pollen data from lake sediments in Italy and from a Mediterranean sediment core, linked by a common tephrochronology. Our lacustrine sequence extends to the past 102,000 years. Many of its features correlate well with the Greenland ice-core records, demonstrating that the closely coupled ocean-atmosphere system of the Northern Hemisphere during the last glacial(4) extended its influence at least as far as the central Mediterranean region. Numerous vegetation changes were rapid, frequently occurring in less than 200 years, showing that the terrestrial biosphere participated fully in last-glacial climate variability. Earlier than 65,000 years ago, our record shows more climate fluctuations than are apparent in the Greenland ice cores. Together, the multi-proxy data from the continental and marine records reveal differences in the seasonal character of climate during successive interstadials, and provide a step towards determining the underlying mechanisms of the centennial-millennial-scale variability.					; brandt, urs steiner/GZL-6844-2022; Mackensen, Andreas/J-8600-2013; Zolitschka, Bernd/P-1487-2019; Wulf, Sabine/C-7777-2013	Wulf, Sabine/0000-0003-0229-7656; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Zolitschka, Bernd/0000-0001-8256-0420; Mackensen, Andreas/0000-0002-5024-4455; 													0028-0836					AUG 19	1999	400	6746					740	743		10.1038/23432	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/23432													WOS:000082131100043

Effluents of some CWs were, however, still with high N and P concentrations and remained to be pollution sources. Widely distributed paddy fields can be exploited to alleviate this concern. We were the first to investigate a combination system of three-level CWs with wetland paddy fields in a full scale to remove N and P from rural unregulated non-point sources. The removal efficiencies (REs) of CWs reached 57.3 % (37.4-75.1 %) for N and 76.3 % (62.0-98.4 %) for P. The CWs retained about 1,278 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 121 kg P ha(-1) year(-1). There was a notable seasonal change in REs of N and P, and the REs were different in different processing components of CWs. The removal rates of wetland paddy fields adopt "zero-drainage" water management according to local rainfall forecast and physiological water demand of crop growth reached 93.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 5.4 kg P ha(-1) year(-1). The rice season had higher potential in removing N and P than that in the wheat season. The whole combined system (0.56 ha CWs and 5.5 ha wetland paddy fields) removed 1,790 kg N year(-1) and 151 kg P year(-1), which were higher than those from CWs functioned alone. However, another 4.7-ha paddy fields were needed to fully remove the N and P in the effluents of CWs. The combination of CWs and paddy fields proved to be a more efficient nutrient removal system.					; Sun, Haijun/AAL-3611-2020; Li, Xiaoran/OGO-0799-2025	zhang, hailin/0000-0002-8545-1032; Sun, Haijun/0000-0003-2177-469X													0269-4042	1573-2983				DEC	2013	35	6			SI		801	809		10.1007/s10653-013-9536-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-013-9536-9								23703587					WOS:000326055000010

In this study, we present a comprehensive assessment of GLOF risk in the Poiqu-Bhotekoshi and Gyirong-Trishuli transboundary basins, which span between China and Nepal. We employed Machine Learning (ML) models, initially trained in the Himalayas, to evaluate GLOF susceptibility in these basins. Also, we conducted hydrodynamic modeling of two representative glacial lakes for multi-dam break scenarios (high, medium, and low). These outcomes were intersected with publicly available physical infrastructure data to assess exposure and risk. Our findings identify 28 glacial lakes (>= 0.01 km2) as highly susceptible to GLOFs. In extreme scenarios, modeled lakes could release peak discharges ranging from 7532 to 38,220 m3/s and inundate up to 60 m depth, surpassing seasonal high-flow floods by up to ten times. Our analysis indicates that over 3000 buildings, about 50 bridges, nine hydropower sites, and around 50 km of the road could be at risk from anticipated GLOFs. Specifically, six sub-districts in Nepal and two counties in China have been identified as high risk. This study is expected to help authorities and policymakers in both countries in developing joint-ventured holistic disaster risk reduction strategies, thereby mitigating the GLOF risk in these vulnerable transboundary basins.

However, the presence of point or non-point pollution sources in watersheds may lead to increased levels of DBP precursors which in turn form DBPs in the drinking water treatment plant upon chlorination or chloramination. In this study, water samples were collected from a lake used to obtain drinking water for Istanbul as well as its tributaries to investigate the presence of the precursors of two disinfection by-products, trihalomethanes (THM) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). In addition, the effect of seasons and the possible relationships between these precursors and water quality parameters were evaluated. The concentrations of THM and NDMA precursors measured as total THM formation potential (TTHMFP) and NDMA formation potential (NDMAFP) ranged between 126 and 1523 mu g/L THM and <2 and 1648 ng/L NDMA, respectively. Such wide ranges imply that some of the tributaries are affected by anthropogenic pollution sources, which is also supported by high DOC, Cl- and NH3 concentrations. No significant correlation was found between the water quality parameters and DBP formation potential, except for a weak correlation between NDMAFP and DOC concentrations. The effect of the sampling location was more pronounced than the seasonal variation due to anthropogenic pollution in some tributaries and no significant correlation was obtained between the seasons and water quality parameters.

Several lakes have been disturbed mainly because urbanization causes eutrophication due to the illegal discharge of wastewater. We compared 22 metrics based on the structural attributes of macro-invertebrates associated with Egeria najas across seasons between five lakes with different human disturbance levels. Sixty-six samples of E. najas and associated invertebrates were collected seasonally using a net with an area of 962cm(2). A total of 17,737 macro-invertebrates of eight major groups, 35 families and 30 genera were recorded. The total macro-invertebrate abundance (number of individuals per plant dry weigh) and the family richness were significantly higher in less disturbed lakes than those under human disturbance, but the differences between seasons were not significant. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis differentiated the macro-invertebrate abundances between the more and less disturbed lakes; instead, the diversity indices were not useful for measuring the changes in the studied lakes. Besides, total number of taxa, number of EOT (Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Trichoptera) taxa, abundance and proportion of Trichoptera and abundance of Chironomidae reflected significant differences between the more and less disturbed lakes. Our results suggest that seven invertebrate metrics respond to urbanization, and they could be used to assess biological integrity of the studied lakes in complement of chemical monitoring of water quality. Management efforts should focus on the maintenance of macrophyte stands that provide high invertebrate diversity, which serve as food for a wide variety of fish.

Understanding the details of the surface water quality of the lake, and the effect of seasons on the quality, is important. In our previous studies, we conducted fuzzy regression analysis of remote sensing data and direct measurements of water quality. The results showed that estimation maps of water quality were well created, using only five data points of the water quality parameters. To obtain maps that are in good agreement with the experimental data, remote sensing data and water quality values should be acquired simultaneously. However, performing such simultaneous observations can affect the preparation of the water quality estimation maps. We overcame this obstacle by using fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), and considered the effect of specific disturbances and uncertainties on the remote sensing data. Furthermore, FCM using only remote sensing data creates estimation maps in which relative water surface conditions are classified. Therefore, determining the relationship between FCM results and water quality facilitates the creation of low-cost, high-frequency water quality estimation maps. Our results indicated that FCM was particularly effective in determining the presence of suspended solids (SS) during water quality analysis. However, the relationship between FCM results and water quality has not been determined in detail. In this study, we analyzed the water quality conditions of Lake Hachiroko with FCM using the data collected by the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer on Terra and, the Operational Land Imager on Landsat-8. In addition, FCM results were compared with the maps created by fuzzy regression analysis and the actual conditions of water pollution. The results indicated that (i) the maps created using FCM are effective in determining the water surface conditions, (ii) the FCM maps using data obtained during August and September have a strong relationship with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and SS, and (iii) the FCM maps using data obtained during May and June have a strong relationship with chemical oxygen demand (COD), SS, and total nitrogen (T-N).

Yang, C. Yin, W. Li, and X. Xu, J. Bacteriol. 190:1554-1560, 2008). Hypothetically, certain factors induced during preconditioning are involved in acquisition of chill-light tolerance. In this study, Rbp1 (RNA-binding protein 1) rather than Rbp2 was found to be accumulated during preconditioning, and the accumulation of Rbp1 was correlated with the increase of chill-light tolerance. Inactivation of its encoding gene rbp1 led to a great reduction in the acquired chill-light tolerance, while ectopic expression of rbp1 enabled the cyanobacterium to survive the chill-light stress without preconditioning. Microarray analyses suggested that the Rbp1-dependent chill-light tolerance may not be based on its influence on mRNA abundance of certain genes. Similarly to that in Synechocystis, the Rbp1 homologue(s) can be accumulated in Microcystis cells collected from a subtropic lake in low-temperature seasons. Rbp1 is the first factor shown to be both accumulated early during preconditioning and directly involved in development of chill-light tolerance in Synechocystis. Its accumulation may greatly enhance the overwintering capability in certain groups of cyanobacteria.					yin, chuntao/C-8503-2012; Tan, Xiaoming/E-6571-2013; Zhu, Tao/JEF-1129-2023	Tan, Xiaoming/0000-0002-7375-3674; 													0021-9193	1098-5530				JUN	2011	193	11					2675	2683		10.1128/JB.01454-10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.01454-10								21460086					WOS:000290527900001

Local-scale impacts of water hyacinth on water quality in a hypereutrophic lake	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Increased nutrient concentrations have been linked to water quality impairments across the world. In Lake Victoria, the second largest freshwater lake in the world, decades of eutrophication have challenged water quality management and led to conditions with compromising levels of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. Our study focuses on Winam Gulf, where a resurgence of water hyacinth has led to renewed challenges with navigation and anoxia, but also may present a local-scale opportunity for water quality improvements. Over the course of 1.5 years, we conducted three, in situ experiments to vary levels of water hyacinth density and determined its effects on lake water nutrient composition, biochemical parameters (chlorophyll a, cyanotoxins), and fecal indicators (fecal coliforms and Escherchia coli). While our study did not show overwhelming improvements in water quality with increasing water hyacinth density, we did find that small-scale removal of water hyacinth led to decreases in coliforms (F-1,F- 11 = 11.14, p < 0.01), E. coli (F-1,F- 11 = 22.95, p < 0.001), and total microcystins (F-1,F- 9 = 3.47, p = 0.095). Throughout the experiment, the majority of samples collected had both E. coli and microcystin concentrations, notably exceeding World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water. Our data suggest that magnitude of scale, as well as season considerations such as rainfall and background level of water hyacinth, will strongly influence the phytoremediation potential of water hyacinth. The data encourages further exploration of remediation potential of native and introduced macrophytes.

We took advantage of two exceptionally dry years in northern Ethiopia to study the effect of a dry period and the associated fish kills on reservoir ecology and water quality. We studied 13 reservoirs, seven of which dried up in 2009. Four of the latter dried up again in 2010. We monitored the ecology of these reservoirs from 2009 to 2011, hypothesising that the pattern of reservoir drying would explain ecological differences among them. Reservoirs that refilled after drying had a significantly lower fish biomass, lower biomass of phytoplankton (expressed as chlorophyll-a) and cyanobacteria (Microcystis), clearer water, greater macrophyte cover and lower nutrient concentrations than reservoirs that did not dry. Although the differences in water quality were most striking in the wet season after a drying event, there were persistent effects on reservoir ecology. The three categories of reservoirs we distinguished, based on their behaviour in 2009 and 2010, also showed differences in 2004, a year during which none of the reservoirs dried out. While drying evidently results in better water quality, we could not disentangle the effects of drying per se from that of reductions in fish biomass. The total combined effect was highly significant in all 3years, whereas the separate effects of drying and loss of fish were only significant in 2004. Our results suggest that differences in water quality and ecology among reservoirs depend on their propensity to dry out. Drying might be used as a restoration measure to reduce potentially harmful cyanobacterial blooms in reservoirs.					; Declerck, Steven/E-4338-2010; Gebremichael, Anwar/D-2388-2016; Dejene, Tsehaye/KVB-8699-2024; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015	Bauer, Hans/0000-0001-5031-5842; Lemmens, Pieter/0000-0002-3135-9724; Declerck, Steven/0000-0001-6179-667X; Asgedom, Abraha Gebrekidan/0000-0002-6996-7426; Teferi, Mekonen/0000-0002-1868-3319; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Dejene, Tsehaye Asmelash/0000-0002-6182-6223													0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2014	59	4					870	884		10.1111/fwb.12312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12312													WOS:000332220100018

Distribution, relative abundance and size composition of the threatened serranid Epinephelus daemelii in New South Wales, Australia	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The aim of this study was to undertake baseline surveys on the distribution, relative abundance and total lengths (LT) of a threatened epinephelid species, black cod Epinephelus daemelii, in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, their westernmost distribution. Diving surveys at 83 sites where E. daemelii were expected to occur were undertaken from 2009 to 2011 using 45min roving diver counts. Sites were spread through northern NSW, including Lord Howe Island (LHI). Individual fish were measured using stereo-video, enabling accurate length measurement. Surveys were repeated at a sub-set of sites to assess temporal variation across days, seasons and years. A total of 117 E. daemelii were recorded during baseline surveys, occurring at 42% of the surveyed sites. Across all surveys, the highest numbers recorded (14-18 individuals at a site) were at the outer Solitary Islands and Fish Rock (Smoky Cape). Fewer E. daemelii were found southwards, but two sites in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park had consistent numbers (three to six) over four annual surveys. Only 12 E. daemelii were recorded from eight of the 18 sites at LHI. The numbers observed at re-surveyed sites were generally stable over years. There were latitudinal and cross-shelf differences in LT. Individuals in the north were found to be significantly larger than those further south, and fish offshore were significantly larger than those inshore. The largest measured fish was 135 cm, smaller than the maximum LT(c. 170 cm) recorded for this species. The smallest fish was 26 cm. Overall, it is considered that the abundance of E. daemelii is low compared to anecdotal data even though they have been protected for c. 30 years in NSW. These findings provide an essential benchmark to assess ongoing status and response to protective management.

Assessment of metal status in drainage canal water and their bioaccumulation in Oreochromis niloticus fish in relation to human health	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The purpose of this study was to assess metal concentrations (Al, Cd, Pb, Hg and Ni) in Sabal drainage canal (Al-Menoufiya Province, River Nile Delta, Egypt) water as well as their accumulation in some selected organs (skin, muscles and kidneys) of Oreochromis niloticus fish to evaluate their hazard levels in relation to the maximum residual limits for human consumption. Drainage canal water was found to be heavily polluted with metals which far exceeded the permissible limits. It was found that metals accumulated in organs of O. niloticus in concentrations higher than those of canal water. Kidneys of O. niloticus contained the highest concentrations of the detected metals, while skin appeared to be the least preferred site for the bioaccumulation of metals as the lowest metals concentrations were detected in this tissue. The present study shows that fish organs contained high levels of metals exceeding the permissible limits values. Metals in muscle of fish were higher than the maximum permissible concentrations for human consumption. Thus, consuming fish caught from drainage canals is harmful to the consumers.

We established multiple monitoring stations (9 flow and 24 water quality stations) from headwaters to near the outflow that were operated for 2 field seasons, complementing longer term data from a flow monitoring site and water chemistry monitoring site. We applied the Branched-INCA-P model, which allows fully distributed simulations supported by highly distributed monitoring data. Using spatially distributed data helped better understand variable P and sediment dynamics across the catchment and identify key model uncertainties and uncertainties related to catchment P management. Measured and modelled total P concentrations often exceeded provisional water quality thresholds in many areas of the catchment and highlight the value of studying water quality across multiple subcatchments rather than at a single site. Total P export coefficients differed widely among subcatchments, ranging from 2.1-21.4 kg km(-2) y(-1) over a single year. Export coefficients were most strongly (negatively) related to the proportion of wetland cover in subcatchments. The INCA-P model captured spatial variation in P concentrations relatively well, but short-term temporal variability in the observed data was not well simulated across sites, in part due to unmodelled hydrological phenomena including beaver activity and unknown drivers of P peaks that were not associated with hydrological events.					; whitehead, paul/K-8689-2012; Futter, Martyn/G-6238-2011; Oni, Stephen/J-6748-2012; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Crossman, Jill/0000-0003-2679-5991; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Futter, Martyn/0000-0002-9789-7138; Oni, Stephen/0000-0002-7345-9344; 													2044-2041						2013	3	2					187	206		10.5268/IW-3.2.530	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-3.2.530													WOS:000318267500007

However, the seasonal variations and the key water quality variables connected with these cyanobacterial metabolites are relatively unknown. In this study, eight odorous compounds and water quality variables in Lake Taihu were evaluated monthly from January to December 2009. Dissolved odorous compounds were found at very low levels throughout the year whereas higher values were detected in the particulate fractions, with the peak values 242.4 ng/L for dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), 395.6 ng/L for 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), 47.3 ng/L for 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) and 11 ng/L for 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP), 2072 ng/L for beta-cyclocital, 573 ng/L for beta-ionone, respectively, far exceeding their respective odor thresholds. Microcystis biomass, TP, chl-a, and PO4-P contributed significantly to the variations of T&O compounds. Microcysitis biomass explained most of the variations of T&O compounds, with a proportion of 87.4 % and were positively correlated with DMS (r=0.26, p <0.01), MIB (r=0.24, p <0.01), geosmin (r=0.31, p <0.01), beta-cyclocitral (r=0.76, p <0.01) and beta-ionone (r=0.74, p <0.01). This study indicates that particulate compounds should be taken into account as a potential source of odorants and that the concentrations of taste and odor compounds could be predicted by Microcysitis biomass in Lake Taihu.

The Triple S Method of Producing Sweet Potato Planting Material for Areas in Africa with Long Dry Seasons	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT												Ugandan farmers preferred vine cuttings from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L) Lam.) plants maintained during the dry season in a swamp or by irrigation as planting material rather than cuttings from volunteer plants growing from unharvested roots. The latter were late and weevil-infested, though readily available. To improve their earliness, roots planted 5, 10, 15, or 25 cm below ground at the start of the dry season were watered from 5 or 10 weeks before the start of the rains. Only those planted 10 cm deep emerged satisfactorily; those watered for 10 weeks produced more vines. To improve survival, roots were stored under various conditions before planting and watering: roots stored in dry sand in a roofed building survived especially well and sprouted prolifically, producing many cuttings. This method of producing vine cuttings, called the Triple S method, was validated by farmers in the Lake Zone of Tanzania, which has a harsher climate than Uganda. In addition to providing farmers with ample early and healthy planting material for little and infrequent watering, it provided convenience and ownership.																			1542-7528	1542-7536					2013	27	1					67	84		10.1080/15427528.2012.727376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15427528.2012.727376													WOS:000452719900004

High dispersal is suggested to constrain local optimization of communities and to result in strong synchrony of temporal dynamics at different sites. However, spatio-temporal dynamics of plankton are rarely analysed in lakes mainly due to the sampling effort involved. Here, we present a long-term (14 years) data set of zooplankton abundance sampled fortnightly at five stations simultaneously in a large lake. This unique data set allows us to distinguish instantaneous from persistent horizontal pattern. As expected, population dynamics were highly synchronized among stations, whereas synchrony declined with distance between sites. Synchronization varied strongly among taxa but also between sites. Despite the observed synchrony, coherency distinct spatial variations were found in community structure, abundance, life history traits (clutch size) and life cycle strategies (diapause). Spatial differences varied among taxa, sites and season and could be large with spatial differences in mean abundances of the same taxon of two orders of magnitude. Spatial patterns persisted throughout the whole study period and cannot be fully explained by passive transport due to wind-induced water currents. Hence, local optimization of communities is indeed possible in lakes. We relate our findings to metacommunity theory since the observed patterns suggest a community structured by species sorting.

Knowledge of this new predator's trophic ecology is essential to identify threats, plan control strategies and conserve native fauna. We studied seasonal mink diet in TDF in different habitats. We identified undigested remains from 493 scats collected between May 2005 and March 2009 along marine coasts and freshwater shores (rivers and lakes). Small mammals and fish were the main mink prey in TDF (over 65% of diet items). Seasonal variations were not detected, but diet did vary significantly between marine and freshwater habitats, where more terrestrial items were consumed. Among mammals, mink consumed more small native rodents than exotic species. Native fish consumption was also important with greater representation of species from the families Nototheniidae and Galaxiidae in marine and freshwater habitats respectively. Birds were the third item in importance, but did not constitute a particularly large part of the mink's diet on TDF. Overall, differences found in mink diet between habitats reflected their generalist/opportunistic feeding behaviour and did not differ greatly from observations in its native range or in other areas where it has been introduced. Our results establish the interactions between this novel predator and its prey and also illustrate the need to continue research on native prey populations to quantify mink impact on them and understand the ecological context of this biotic assemblage.

J	Bryant, LD; Little, JC; Bürgmann, H				Bryant, Lee D.; Little, John C.; Buergmann, Helmut			Response of sediment microbial community structure in a freshwater reservoir to manipulations in oxygen availability	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Hypolimnetic oxygenation systems (HOx) are being increasingly used in freshwater reservoirs to elevate dissolved oxygen levels in the hypolimnion and suppress sedimentwater fluxes of soluble metals (e.g. Fe and Mn) which are often microbially mediated. We assessed changes in sediment microbial community structure and corresponding biogeochemical cycling on a reservoir-wide scale as a function of HOx operations. Sediment microbial biomass as quantified by DNA concentration was increased in regions most influenced by the HOx. Following an initial decrease in biomass in the upper sediment while oxygen concentrations were low, biomass typically increased at all depths as the 4-month-long oxygenation season progressed. A distinct shift in microbial community structure was only observed at the end of the season in the upper sediment near the HOx. While this shift was correlated to HOx-enhanced oxygen availability, increased TOC levels and precipitation of Fe- and Mn-oxides, abiotic controls on Fe and Mn cycling, and/or the adaptability of many bacteria to variations in prevailing electron acceptors may explain the delayed response and the comparatively limited changes at other locations. While the sediment microbial community proved remarkably resistant to relatively short-term changes in HOx operations, HOx-induced variation in microbial structure, biomass, and activity was observed after a full season of oxygenation.					; Little, John/B-4154-2009; Burgmann, Helmut/E-8804-2011	Little, John/0000-0003-2965-9557; Bryant, Lee/0000-0002-1783-6942; Burgmann, Helmut/0000-0002-5651-5906; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				APR	2012	80	1					248	263		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01290.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01290.x								22224595					WOS:000301051600021
J	Owusu, K; Waylen, P; Qiu, YL				Owusu, Kwadwo; Waylen, Peter; Qiu, Youliang			Changing rainfall inputs in the Volta basin: implications for water sharing in Ghana	GEOJOURNAL												We present evidence from the analysis of gridded annual rainfall data that, increased variability and declining rainfall totals are the main cause of declining lake levels in the Volta basin above the Akosombo Dam. West Africa has undergone a period of diminished rainfall, punctuated by a series of severe droughts and marked by a shift in rainfall regime. As a result, lake levels behind the hydroelectric impoundment have fluctuated so widely at times that, power has had to be rationed. The trends in the spatial and temporal variability of annual rainfall in the riparian nations explain the low impoundment levels frequent in recent decades. The drying of Burkina Faso and Mali is particularly marked and synchronous to an apparent shift in the rainfall regime in Ghana towards a longer dry season and vanishing short dry spell, the effects which tend to negate each other. The various regional and temporal associations between El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO) are investigated as a possible cause of variation across the basin. The strengths of these associations and low frequency shifts suggest an unfortunate correspondence between national and climatological boundaries which may serve to heighten regional political tensions resulting from ENSO effects. Lack of re-investment in the Akosombo Dam as a result of management policies, political and pre-construction contractual agreements have all conspired in recent decades to make these hydro-climatological changes more devastating.

In this study, the Fuhe River watershed in South China was selected as the study area to analyze physicochemical characteristics and heavy metal (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd and Cr) concentrations in river water in the dry and rainy seasons, in 2019, with the purpose of exploring their spatial-temporal variations and main influences and assessing the potential health risks of heavy metals. The pH value of river water varied from 5.82 to 7.97, and it fluctuated less overall in the dry season, but it oscillated greatly in the rainy season and was lower, especially in the lower reach of the Fuhe River. The electrical conductivity (EC) value changed between 33 mu S/cm and 128 mu S/cm and increased and fluctuated along the river flow in the two periods. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn in river water showed obvious differences between the two periods. The concentrations of Cd and Cu were lower with the ranges from 0.001 mu g/L to 0.67 mu g/L and from 1 mu g/L to 12 mu g/L, respectively, in the dry season than in the rainy season, while there were inverse cases for other heavy metals. Along the river flow, the Cr concentration was stable, whereas other heavy metals showed increasing trends. It was noted that the concentrations of heavy metals in the Fuhe River were, on average, lower than the Chinese drinking standard values, with the concentration of Pb in the dry season significantly higher than the drinking standard value of the World Health Organization (WHO). Principal component analysis and correlation analysis showed that rock weathering and anthropogenic inputs were the main controlling factors of Cu and Zn in the Fuhe River, and human activities were mainly responsible for Pb, Cr, and Cd concentrations. The health risk assessment results showed that the non-carcinogenic risk (HQ(ingestion)) value of Pb was greater than 1 in most sampling points in the middle and lower reaches in the dry season, suggesting a significant non-carcinogenic risk for adults and children by direct ingestion. The minimum carcinogenic risk (CRingestion) value of Cr was more than 10(-4) in the rainy and dry seasons, and the CRingestion value of Cd in some sampling points was more than 10(-4) in the rainy season, indicating significant cancer risks to adults and children. For areas with significant pollution and health risks in the Fuhe River watershed, it is urgent to strengthen the controls of industrial, agricultural, and urban wastewater discharge.

It has been shrinking since the Little Ice Age (LIA) period, with increasing rates in recent years. An uplift of crustal deformation in response to this deglaciation process has been expected. The goal of this investigation is to analyze the crustal deformation caused by ice retreat using time-series data from continuous GPS stations (2015-2020) in the northern area of the SPI. For this purpose, we installed two continuous GPS stations on rocky nunataks of the SPI (the GRCS near Greve glacier and the GBCS close by Cerro Gorra Blanca). In addition, ice elevation changes (2000-2019) were analyzed by the co-registration of the SRTM digital elevation model and ICESat elevation data points. The results of the vertical components are positive (36.55 +/- 2.58 mm a(-1)), with a maximum at GBCS, indicating the highest rate of crustal uplift ever continuously recorded in Patagonia; in addition, the mean horizontal velocities reached 11.7 mm a(-1) with an azimuth of 43(?). The negative ice elevation changes detected in the region have also accelerated in the recent two decades, with a median delta h (elevation change) of -3.36 +/- 0.01 m a(-1) in the ablation zone. The seasonality of the GPS signals was contrasted with the water levels of the main Patagonian lakes around the SPI, detecting a complex interplay between them. Hence, the study sheds light on the knowledge of the crustal uplift as evidence of the wastage experienced by the SPI glaciers.					; Gende, Mauricio/G-3811-2013	Vacaflor, Paulina/0000-0003-4563-9986; Gende, Mauricio/0000-0003-2600-4969; Lenzano, Maria Gabriela/0000-0001-8033-9183; Rivera, Andres/0000-0002-2779-4192														2072-4292				FEB	2023	15	3							584	10.3390/rs15030584	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15030584													WOS:000935703300001

Each transect was sampled for fish using throw traps and gillnets during the flood period of 2006. Multivariate multiple regression analysis and multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that depth was the only variable that affected the structure of the fish assemblage, both for quantitative data (abundance) and qualitative data (presence-absence). Species such as Neofundulus parvipinnis and Laetacara dorsigera were more abundant in shallower sites (below 25 cm), while Serrasalmus maculatus and Metynnis mola were found mostly in the deepest areas (over 55 cm). However, species such as Hoplias malabaricus and Hoplerythrinus unitaeniatus occurred at all sampled depths. Although the distribution of most species was restricted to a few sites, there was a positive relationship between species richness and depth of the water body. Surprisingly, the replacement of native vegetation by exotic pasture did not affect the fish assemblage in the area, at the probability level considered.					; Penha, Jerry/D-6238-2013; Fernandes, Izaias/H-8000-2015	Fernandes, Izaias/0000-0003-0402-2891; Penha, Jerry/0000-0003-4437-092X; 													1679-6225					APR-JUN	2010	8	2					289	298		10.1590/S1679-62252010000200007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1679-62252010000200007													WOS:000280203100007

The regionalization process has three main components: (i) delineation of regions using clustering algorithms, (ii) determining the optimal number of regions using cluster validity indices (CVIs), and (iii) validation of regions for homogeneity using L-moments ratio test. The identification of the optimal number of clusters will significantly affect the homogeneity of the regions. The objective of this study is to investigate the performance of the various CVIs in identifying the optimal number of clusters, which maximizes the homogeneity of the precipitation regions. The k-means clustering algorithm is adopted to delineate the regions using location-based attributes for two large areas from Canada, namely, the Prairies and the Great Lakes-St Lawrence lowlands (GL-SL) region. The seasonal precipitation data for 55 years (1951-2005) is derived using high-resolution ANUSPLIN gridded point data for Canada. The results indicate that the optimal number of clusters and the regional homogeneity depends on the CVI adopted. Among 42 cluster indices considered, 15 of them outperform in identifying the homogeneous precipitation regions. The Dunn, Det_ratio and Trace(W-1B) indices found to be the best for all seasons in both the regions.

Continuous observations collected between 2011 and 2014 in the Milne Fiord epishelf lake, in the Canadian Arctic, showed that the depth of the halocline varied seasonally by up to 3.3m, which was comparable to interannual variability. The seasonal depth variation was controlled by the magnitude of surface meltwater inflow and the hydraulics of the inferred outflow pathway, a narrow basal channel in the Milne Ice Shelf. When seasonal variation and an episodic mixing of the halocline were accounted for, long-term records of depth indicated there was no significant change in thickness of ice along the basal channel from 1983 to 2004, followed by a period of steady thinning at 0.50 m a(-1) between 2004 and 2011. Rapid thinning at 1.15 m a(-1) then occurred from 2011 to 2014, corresponding to a period of warming regional air temperatures. Continued warming is expected to lead to the breakup of the ice shelf and the imminent loss of the last known epishelf lake in the Arctic.					; Laval, Bernard/J-9861-2012; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Mueller, Derek/0000-0003-1974-319X; Laval, Bernard Edmond/0000-0002-4810-9246; Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Hamilton, Andrew/0000-0002-2286-1472													1994-0416	1994-0424				SEP 12	2017	11	5					2189	2211		10.5194/tc-11-2189-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-11-2189-2017													WOS:000410512200002

The DO values decreased approximately by 1.5 times and turbidity ten times, while COD and NH4-N values increased by approximately 1.5 times, SO4 2.5 times, and temperature, NO2-N, and PO4-P 3.5 times in the dry season. The ULB was evaluated for water quality index (WQI), organic pollution index (OPI), eutrophication index (EI), nutrient pollution index (NPI), hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), Pearson's correlation index (PCI), principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA) and Geographic Information System (GIS) to show the comprehensive holistic quality characteristics for ecotoxicological, statistical and visual perspectives. Results revealed the contamination of the investigated habitats as follows: OS > UL > MS > ES. The health risk assessment was under the acceptable level (HI < 1) for the studied habitats. The PCA noted two influential factors ("agriculture factor" and "sewage factor"), and CA established three groups such as "relatively less contaminated zone", "relatively moderate contaminated zone" and "relatively more contaminated zone".

Influence of ecological factors and of land use on mercury levels in fish in the Tapajos River basin, Amazon	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Mercury (Hg) contamination of riparian communities and of environmental compartments of the Amazon can be directly related to the occupation of the territory. The objective of this study was to identify the characteristics of aquatic environments that are associated with high levels of Hg in ichthyofauna. Our research aimed at determining the influence of variables related to fish ecology, types of aquatic environment, fishing activities by local riparian populations, and watershed use on the levels of contamination of ichthyofauna. Six sites were sampled during two distinct periods of the hydrological cycle: at the beginning of descending waters and during low waters. We focused on ten dominant fish species representing four trophic levels: Curimata inornata, Geophagus proximus, Schizodon vittatum, Leporinus fasciatus, Anostomoides laticeps, Hemiodus unimaculatus, Caenotropus labyrinthicus, Hoplias malabaricus, Plagioscion squamosissimus, Acestrorhynchus falcirostris. The study sites, which included lotic and lentic habitats, are exploited year-round by local riparian communities. Spatial variations in Hg contamination in ichthyofauna were determined by factorial analysis of variance taking into account fish diets, seasons, and sampling sites. Multiple regressions were used to check the influence of ecological and anthropogenic variables and variables related to watershed uses, on Hg levels in key species representing the four trophic groups. Each variable was checked independently. Next, multiple regressions were used to verify the concomitant influence of selected variables. Independently of the study site and the phase of the hydrologic cycle, fish Hg contamination followed the trend piscivores > omnivores > herbivores > detritivores. In all the aquatic study sites, Hg levels measured in predatory species were often higher than the 500 ng/g fresh weight threshold. Mean Hg levels in key species were significantly higher during descending waters in lotic environments, and during low waters in lentic environments. Data from this study demonstrated that simple models based on watershed use and on easily obtained variables such as the suspended particulate matter (SPM) load and SPM Hg concentrations, number of inhabitants, habitat types, and the stage in the hydrological cycle enable very good prediction of Hg levels in fish. Our cartographical data clearly showed that the watershed site with the highest aquatic vegetation cover (6% of the open water body) and with the lowest forest cover (62% of the land) corresponded to the highest Hg concentrations in fish. Conversely, the watershed site with 94% forest cover and 1% aquatic vegetation corresponded to the lowest levels Hg concentrations in fish. These results suggest that land uses of watersheds play a key role in the level of Hg contamination of local ichthyofauna. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Rimet, F; Druart, JC; Anneville, O				Rimet, Frederic; Druart, Jean-Claude; Anneville, Orlane			Exploring the dynamics of plankton diatom communities in Lake Geneva using emergent self-organizing maps (1974-2007)	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Lake Geneva, situated between France and Switzerland, is a large lake of major importance for the regional economy. As a result, its ecological quality has been monitored using several parameters since 1974. Phytoplankton was one of the items monitored. Diatoms were among the most diverse algae in this compartment. In order to characterize their dynamics, diatoms were explored and Clustered using an emergent self-organizing map. Eight different communities were defined on the basis of the U-matrix. Most of them displayed a clear seasonal pattern, some communities were present during the water stratification phase, and others were present during the mixing phase. These communities also displayed a clear interannual dynamic pattern. Some were on the decrease, some even disappearing altogether; whereas others tended to increase or to appear. These dynamic patterns were related to the re-oligotrophication of the lake; Lake Geneva was eutrophic in the 70s to mid 80s, and has been meso-eutrophic since the late 90s. A discriminant analysis showed that phosphorus was the determining parameter for diatom communities. These findings confirmed the effectiveness of diatoms for use as a trophic indicator, and their suitability for use in paleolimnological studies on Lake Geneva. Compared to multivariate analyses which only ordinate and had quite undecipherable graphs when data are numerous, e-SOM showed the advantage to cluster and ordinate data in a single analysis and to present a self-evident and intuitive visualization output.

Landscape sensitivity and ecological change in western Zambia: The long-term perspective from dambo cut-and-fill sediments	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A series of small, shallow seasonally, or interannually, waterlogged depressions (dambos) in the upper Zambezi Valley in western Zambia hold shallow peat deposits and are bounded on their western margin by sandy lunette dunes. Using luminescence dating of sands, fossil pollen analyses and the macrocharcoal record from cored peat, the long-term stability of these landforms and the vegetation they now support is investigated at a site east of the upper Zambezi. Although the upper lunette dune sediments accumulated between 14 +/- 2 and 6 +/- 1 ka, the onset of peat accumulation and preservation within the dambo did not occur until 2800cal a BP, suggesting that only from this point onwards were conditions stable and wet enough year-round to allow the formation and preservation of peat during this time. Results from this study indicate that the long-term behaviour of the dambo conforms to a cut-and-fill dynamic, where under more arid conditions the dambo becomes a dry pan, providing a sediment source for the adjacent lunette dune. In contrast, during wetter times, when the dambo holds surface water year-round, it becomes an organic-rich sediment repository preserving a fossil pollen record of long-term vegetation change.					, Sallie/AAE-5889-2020; Orijemie, Emuobosa/KDO-7527-2024	Burrough, Sallie/0000-0003-1043-0998; Willis, Katherine/0000-0002-6763-2489; Thomas, David/0000-0001-6867-5504; 													0267-8179	1099-1417				JAN	2015	30	1					44	58		10.1002/jqs.2757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.2757													WOS:000348721100006

Previous empirical tests have found significant spatial and environmental effects in pond and lake communities, but this has not yet been clearly established for stream networks. We conducted a multi-season survey of mountain streams in the Iberian Peninsula. We recorded GIS and in situ environmental data and collected biological samples to determine ostracods and macroinvertebrates and identified 41 ostracod species, the most common belonging to genera Herpetocypris, Sarscypridopsis, and Ilyocypris. A generalized linear model analysis showed that thermal range, alkalinity, slope, and the Iberian Average Score Per Taxon (IASPT) macroinvertebrate biotic index negatively influenced ostracod presence, whereas the Iberian Bio-Monitoring Working Party (IBMWP) biotic index and nitrite concentration had a positive effect. Conductivity, mean air temperature, slope, and IBMWP were the most statistically significant environmental factors affecting ostracod species distribution according to a canonical correspondence analysis, together with large-scale spatial factors identified with a principal coordinates neighbour matrix (PCNM) analysis. Both environment and space, although markedly overlapping, contributed significantly to the explanation of ostracod metacommunity structure. We conclude that both colonisation histories and environmental adaptations affect the patterns of distribution of aquatic organisms in riverine environments, extending beyond intra-basin connectivity.

In this study, the persistence of OCPs at Manzala Lake in Egypt was determined. Four different sites were investigated: the El-Gamel, El-Kowar, El-Rasoah, and Janb El-Timsah regions. Among these, the El-Kowar region had the highest concentration of total OCPs in the sediment samples when compared to other regions during both 2012 and 2013. In fact, generally, the residues of OCPs in the sediment samples were significantly higher in all tested sites in comparison with other compartments. Conversely, OCP residues were undetectable in water samples at both the El-Gamel region and the El-Rasoah site in the studied seasons. The data proved that the sediment layer plays a sourcing role in OCP persistence in the aquatic ecosystem. Data analysis also indicated that there was an external source for OCP contamination in the Manzala Lake ecosystem that most likely comes from Nile Basin countries and which extends the expected half-life of these compounds. It could be exemplified by DDT, the half-life of which increased from 30 to approximately 47 years.

J	Mehner, T				Mehner, Thomas			Partial diel vertical migration of sympatric vendace (Coregonus albula) and Fontane cisco (Coregonus fontanae) is driven by density dependence	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Recent studies have indicated that in fish populations performing diel vertical migrations (DVM), some individuals do not migrate but reflect a resident phenotype, a pattern named as partial DVM. I present data on fish densities and the proportion of residents in Lake Stechlin (Germany) as obtained by annual midwater trawling over four discrete depths during nighttime over 8 years. The lake is inhabited by the sympatric vendace (Coregonus albula) and Fontane cisco (Coregonus fontanae). The proportion of vendace residents increased with the density of vendace, whereas the proportion of Fontane cisco residents declined with increasing density, indicating that density plays a role in the migration patterns for both species, but in opposite directions. There were almost no differences in mean size, size-frequency distributions, or Fulton condition factor between resident or migrant parts of the populations in both species. However, the proportion of dry mass in wet mass, which indicates individual nutritional status, had a tendency to be lower in migrants than in residents in both species in the years 2011, 2012, and 2013. These data suggest that density dependence may be an important factor that modifies the proportion of residents in vertically migrating fish populations. In contrast, length-dependent predation vulnerability or systematic individual differences in nutritional status were not strongly supported as potential predictors of the proportion of residents. It needs to be discussed whether partial DVM is conceptually similar to partial seasonal migrations of fish, or whether DVM reflects variants of the ideal free distribution, which are inherently density-dependent.

Taxon-specific hydrogen isotope signals in cultures and mesocosms facilitate ecosystem and hydroclimate reconstruction	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Phytoplankton play a key role in biogeochemical cycles, impacting atmospheric and aquatic chemistry, food webs, and water quality. However, it remains challenging to reconstruct changes in algal community composition throughout the geologic past, as existing proxies are suitable only for a subset of taxa and/or influenced by degradation. Here, we investigate if compound-specific hydrogen isotope ratios (S2H values) of common algal lipids can serve as (paleo)ecologicalindicators. First, we grew 20 species of algae - representing cyanobacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae, and cryptomonads - in batch cultures under identical conditions and measured S2H values of their lipids. Despite identical source water S2H values, lipid S2H values ranged from-455 %o to-52 %o, incorporating variability associated with chemical compound classes and taxonomic groups. In particular, green algae synthesized fatty acids with higher S2H values than other taxa, cyanobacteria synthesized phytol with relatively low S2H values, and diatoms synthesized sterols with higher S2H values than other eukaryotes. Second, we assessed how changes in algal community composition can affect net S2H values of common algal lipids in 20 experimental outdoor ponds, which were manipulated via nutrient loading, and the addition of macrophytes and mussels. High algal biomass in the ponds, which was mainly caused by cyanobacterial and green algal blooms, was associated with higher S2H values for generic fatty acids, relatively stable S2H values for phytol and the dinoflagellate biomarker dinostanol, and lower S2H values for the more cosmopolitan sterol stigmasterol. These results are consistent with expectations from our culture-based analyses, with both datasets indicating large taxon-specific changes that are unlikely to be driven by bacterial heterotrophy. This suggests that measuring S2H values of multiple lipids from sediment and calculating 2 H-offsets between them can resolve changes in algal community composition from changes in source water isotopes. With an appropriate availability of sedimentary lipids, this approach could permit the reconstruction of both taxonomic variability and hydroclimate from diverse sedimentary systems.					; Matthews, Blake/B-5608-2009; Schubert, Carsten/GQQ-1673-2022; Ladd, S.

J	Padial, AA; Thomaz, SM				Padial, Andre Andrian; Thomaz, Sidinei Magela			Prediction of the light attenuation coefficient through the Secchi disk depth: empirical modeling in two large Neotropical ecosystems	LIMNOLOGY												The easiest way to evaluate water transparency is from the Secchi disk depth (SD). The behavior of radiation passing through water can also be quantified by the light attenuation coefficient (k) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), measured using quanta meters. Due to the high costs of quanta meters, k is usually predicted from SD. This prediction can be made using the index SD x k or using nonlinear models that correlate these variables. The aims of this study were to generate models predicting k through SD in two large Neotropical ecosystems (a reservoir and a floodplain) and to test whether 1.7, the index used worldwide, is adequate for predicting k in these ecosystems. The current paper also tested the effects of time (between seasons and among years) and space (between ecosystems and inside each ecosystem) upon such predictions. A standard 30-cm Secchi disk was used to measure SD. Simultaneously, PAR was measured at two depths to estimate k. A total data set of 2,136 measurements taken from 2001 to 2005 was used. The index generated, 2.26, was significantly different from 1.7 (t test, p < 0.01). This suggests that 1.7 is not adequate for Neotropical ecosystems. In general, both the index and the models generated differed across ecosystems and over time. In addition, the analysis showed that a nonlinear model (k = 2.00 x SD-0.76, N = 2,136) was more reliable for predictions.

Over the course of one year (2018/19), the distributions of these compounds were analyzed in the inflow, the lake water, and the topmost sediments (0-2 cm) to assess their origin and transfer into the lake deposits. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to cluster the studied biomarkers into 5 groups with similar characteristics. These groups were comprised of (i) compounds delivered from external sources via the inflow, (ii) autochthonous compounds formed in the lake by eukaryotes or (iii) bacteria, (iv) compounds accumulating in the surface sediment, and (v) C27 to C29 stenols together with their degradation products, C27 to C29 5 alpha(H)-stanols. Their seasonal partition clearly revealed that C27 stenols mainly derived from autochthonous sources within the lake, whereas C29 stenols largely reflect allochthonous material reaching the lake via the inflow. Analysis of stenol plus stanol concentrations with depth in two lake sediment cores (approximate to 30 and 50 cm) found highest C27 to C29 ratios in surface sediments with lowest ratios at depth. These signals are interpreted to reflect the increasing trend of eutrophication of Lake Seeburg and, thus, enhanced autochthonous organic matter production in the lake over the last decades. The abundances of C27 vs. C29 stenols, summed with their respective degradation products, 5 alpha(H)-stanols, are considered as suitable molecular in-dicators to qualitatively reconstruct historical eutrophication trends.

PEERJ												The Negro River currently has seven floating houses where tourists can feed and interact with botos, each with its own history of how these aggregations were formed. Some keepers say these groups are familial, even reporting individuals being born into the group. However, behavioral studies have shown that botos are solitary, only forming groups at feeding areas and during the mating season. In the present study we used 12 microsatellite and molecular sex markers to characterize relationships within and between two boto aggregations (ten and seven botos each) in the lower Negro River. Molecular sexing revealed that all botos sampled from both aggregations were males. This may be explained by habitat preference, as male botos are primarily found in the main channels of large rivers, whereas females prefer more protected areas, such as flooded forests and its channels and lakes. Most of the animals were unrelated within each aggregation, demonstrating that these aggregations are not normally formed due to kinship bonds, but are exclusively for feeding, as botos learn that these places provide easy access to food. This study provides important information that helps us understand how human interaction is affecting the social structure and behavior of these animals.					da Silva, Vera/AAE-8126-2021; Gravena, Waleska/AAJ-2875-2020; Farias, Izeni/J-3069-2014; Hrbek, Tomas/J-6988-2012	Gravena, Waleska/0000-0002-1102-971X; Farias, Izeni/0000-0002-1416-4351; Hrbek, Tomas/0000-0003-3239-7068													2167-8359					APR 17	2019	7								e6692	10.7717/peerj.6692	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6692								31024759					WOS:000464918100003

Impact of Pesticide Contamination on Aquatic Microorganism Populations in the Littoral Zone	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The effect of pesticide contamination of the littoral zone on the population of bacteria and fungi was analyzed using the example of a eutrophic water reservoir exposed for > 30 years to the influence of expired crop-protection chemicals, mainly DDT. For three consecutive years, quantity analyses of bacteria and fungi were conducted and the composition of the microorganism population analyzed against seasonal dynamics. Mold and yeast-like fungi were also isolated and identified. Within the Bacteria domain, in addition to the large groups of microorganisms (Alphaprotobacteria, Betaprobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacterium), the analysis also involved the presence of bacteria predisposed to degraded pesticides in natural environments: Pseudomonas spp. and Alcaligenes spp. The quantity dynamics of aquatic microorganisms indicated that bacteria and fungi under the influence of long-term exposure to DDT can adapt to the presence of this pesticide in water. No modifying effect of DDT was observed on the quantity of microorganisms or the pattern of seasonal relationships in the eutrophic lake. Changes were shown in the percentage share of large groups of bacteria in the community of microorganisms as was an effect of contamination on the species diversity of fungi. The data show the effectiveness of aquatic microorganism-community analyses as a tool for indicating changes in the water environment caused by pesticide contamination.

A late-Holocene vegetation history from the Maya lowlands, Lamanai, Northern Belize	HOLOCENE												A 3 m core from the New River Lagoon, adjacent to the Maya city of Lamanai, Northern Belize, contains a continuous record of vegetation change between c. 1500 BC and AD 1500. Inferred changes in forest abundance and plant community assemblage build on previous palaeolimnological analysis of the same core reported by Metcalfe et al. (2009). A near-complete, abundant record of Zea mays grains provides a detailed account of field-based agriculture local to Lamanai, in the context of a regional record obtained from a large lake (13.5 km(2)) with a substantial catchment. Three periods (c. 170 BC-AD 150, c. AD 600-980 and c. AD 1500) of extraction of Pinus from pine savannas adjacent to the east of the New River Lagoon, can be distinguished from clearance of seasonal broadleaf forest for agriculture. An increased palm signal is observed during c. 1630-1150 BC and 100 BC-AD 1100 and may be indicative of Maya cultivation. This record shows that during the late Classic period the Maya actively managed the vegetation resources using a combination of field-based agriculture, arboreal resources and perhaps, palm cultivation. There is no evidence from the vegetation history of drying during the late Classic coincident with the Maya 'collapse' and this is consistent with the palaeolimnological and archaeological records of continuous occupation of the Maya at Lamanai. Both the decline in palms c. AD 1400 and the increase in Pinus extraction c. AD 1500 are consistent with changes in vegetation associated with European arrival, however further analysis of material from the last 1000 years will enable a better understanding of vegetation change pre- and post-European encounter.

Relating NDVI to ecosystem CO2 exchange patterns in response to season length and soil warming manipulations in arctic Alaska	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Climate change in the Arctic will differentially affect physiological rates, leaf phenology, and species composition of tundra, resulting in changing patterns and magnitudes of ecosystem CO2 flux. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) provides a potential means to infer changes in CO2 flux, but whether relationships developed between NDVI and flux components can be generalized across the entire growing season and in response to changes induced by climate warming is uncertain. To investigate how well such changes might be assessed using inultispectral digital images, ecosystem CO2 fluxes and NDVI were compared throughout the 2002 growing season on experimental plots with increased growing season length and soil temperature at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Season length was increased by snow removal early in the season and soil terriperatures were increased using heating cables. Carbon dioxide fluxes were measured using static chamber techniques and corresponding NDVI images were taken with an agricultural digital camera. The seasonal patterns of NDVI in all treatments showed an increase to a peak in early August followed by an abrupt decline, with the snow removal plots phenologically advanced compared to the controls. Net ecosystem production (NEP) showed uptake of CO2 early in the season leveling out to a Slight loss Of CO2 at peak season for both control and extended season plots. Gross primary productivity (GPP) closely followed the pattern of NDVI and the pattern of ecosystem respiration (R,) mirrored that of GPP. NDVI was significantly correlated to GPP and ecosystem respiration (R-2 =0.50 and 0.36 respectively) across plots, dates, and treatments combined. However, most of the covariation was across dates. After accounting for seasonal variation, NDVI never accounted for more than 25% of the remaining variation in flux measures. Analysis of covariance showed that a given NDVI value corresponded to different flux rates on different dates and to different R-e among treatments after correcting for date. The slopes of the NDVI-GPP and NDVI-Re relationships were much steeper across dates than across plots. These plot-scale results suggest that NDVI alone is not sufficient to estimate carbon flux rate responses to climate change across space or years. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Griffin, DL				Griffin, DL			Aridity and humidity: two aspects of the late Miocene climate of North Africa and the Mediterranean	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					Symposium on Palaeoclimate Reconstructions Using Fossils	APR, 2000	UNIV MANCHESTER, MANCHESTER, ENGLAND	Palaeontol Assoc, Geol Soc London	UNIV MANCHESTER			The physiography of North Africa is not greatly changed from that of the Messinian. With the drawdown of the Mediterranean in the late Messinian the then existing river systems were incised into the landscape and emptied into Lake Cyrenaica, which occupied the substantially drained Eastern Mediterranean Basin. The record of incision provides a record of the magnitude of the Messinian river systems. An analysis of these river systems demonstrates that Messinian rainfall, a consequence of the Zeit Wet Phase, was greatest in cast and south-central North Africa, in keeping with the derivation of the water mainly from the Indian Ocean. In central North Africa the Eosahabi River flowed from Messinian Lake Chad eroding the East Tibesti Valley and cutting a channel which is especially well preserved near the coast of the Gulf of Sirt. The penetrated sediments of Lake Cyrenaica and the marginal basins of the Messinian transgression are known as the Upper Evaporites and are generally fine clastics, gypsarenites and gypsum/anhydrite. They were rapidly deposited. Underlying them is the halite of the Lower Evaporites. This sequence of Upper and Lower Evaporites is much like the lower halite of the Tortonian South Gharib Formation and the overlying clastics and anhydrite of the Messinian Zeit Formation in the Gulf of Suez/Red Sea area. This type of sequence is termed an evaporitic couplet and, as has been demonstrated for the Gulf of Suez/Red Sea, is a consequence of a transition from a dry to a more humid climate in a restricted or semirestricted basin. This transition occurred at about 7.5 Ma in the Gulf of Suez/Red Sea and at about 5.8 Ma in the Mediterranean. The Zeit Wet Phase manifest in the above events developed in association with the initiation and development of the Asian monsoon and the drying of the Mediterranean. It can be understood in terms of the development of an evolving monsoon/desert system. The Asian monsoon was initiated 8-7 Ma in association with the uplift of Tibet; at this time the North African desert zone was displaced northwards to be over the Mediterranean and central and eastern North Africa became seasonally humid. A concept is advanced in which the early stage of the development of the Asian monsoon is seen as having two phases alternating at the precessional ca 21 ka cycle. One phase transferred moisture from the Indian Ocean mainly to southern Asia, the other phase transferred moisture mainly to North Africa. With the drawdown of the Mediterranean at about 5.8 Ma the Zeit Wet Phase intensified. A further northward movement of the humid and desert zones occurred at the time of drawdown. With the Messinian and early Pliocene transgressions the wet phase ameliorated but a substantial river system still crossed central North Africa. At about 4.6 Ma North Africa became drier probably in response to the developing dominance of the features of the monsoon that transferred moisture mainly to southern Asia, features of the monsoon that are well recognised today.

The study was done from October 2020 to September 2021 and physicochemical parameters such as water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, turbidity, alkalinity, Secchi-depth, nitrate, ammonium, silicon dioxide, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total phosphorus were measured using standard methods. ANOVA results indicated that all physicochemical parameters except turbidity had significant variation (p < 0.05) in all seasons. A total of 66 phytoplankton species grouped into seven phyla, including Bacillariophyta (23 taxa), Chlorophyta (21 taxa), Cyanophyta (14 taxa), Euglenophyta (3 taxa), Charophyta (2 taxa), Dinophyta (2 taxa) and Cryptophyta (1 taxon) were identified. Phytoplankton biomass showed significant spatial and seasonal variation with maximum cell density during the pre-rainy season, and low density in the main rainy season. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that nutrients had a positive affinity with the phytoplankton community, whereas electrical conductivity, water temperature, and pH showed a negative relationship with phytoplankton abundance. Temporal rather that abiotic factors far influenced phytoplankton dynamics in this deep tropical lake. The analysis postulates that partial atelomixis during the pre-rainy months favors higher phytoplankton biomass with functional groups such as desmids and heavy diatoms contributing most during this mixing period, while wet season mixing depressed algal biomass due to increased turbidity with nutrients not being limiting during these times.

Relationships between the biomass production of invasive Ludwigia species and physical properties of habitats in France	HYDROBIOLOGIA					12th International Symposium on Aquatic Weeds	AUG 24-28, 2009	Jyvaskyla, FINLAND	European Weed Res Soc				Ludwigia grandiflora ssp. hexapetala and L. peploides ssp. montevidensis have invaded many types of fresh water ecosystem in France leading to serious problems of management of these macrophytes. The prediction of extracted plant biomass quantities for every control method could considerably help in plant removal and selecting management choices. The paper presents results of the research program "Biological Invasions" granted by the French Environmental Agency concerning the Ludwigia species (2003-2006): "Characterization of the relations between biotopes, plant populations and human activities: Implications for management". The objective of this work is: (1) to compare environmental variables in the western part of France where colonised water bodies are widespread, (2) to link these parameters with the evaluation of standing crops and (3) to propose implications for management planning and control methods. Measured dry biomass of Ludwigia spp. varied from 200 g DM m(-2) in shallow lakes to 4,500 g DM m(-2) in a meander of a eutrophicated river. Results depend on the scale of the analysis: within sites, between-sites, at different seasons or years. In sunny conditions, optimal for these plants and in nutrient rich areas, biomass is high. In general, exposure to wind, waves and currents reduces the standing crop. For plant production as well as removal work, the status of plant development and water level, are key factors.					, AGROCAMPUS OUEST/O-6651-2016	, AGROCAMPUS OUEST/0000-0002-1800-4558													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2010	656	1					173	186		10.1007/s10750-010-0440-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0440-3													WOS:000282180300017
J	Schilder, J; van Roij, L; Reichart, GJ; Sluijs, A; Heiri, O				Schilder, Jos; van Roij, Linda; Reichart, Gert-Jan; Sluijs, Appy; Heiri, Oliver			Variability in δ13C values between individual Daphnia ephippia: Implications for palaeo-studies	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The stable carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13 value) of Daphnia spp. resting egg shells (ephippia) provides information on past changes in Daphnia diet. Measurements are typically performed on samples of >= 20 ephippia, which obscures the range of values associated with individual ephippia. Using a recently developed laser ablation-based technique, we perform multiple delta C-13 analyses on individual ephippia, which show a high degree of reproducibility (standard deviations 0.1-0.5 parts per thousand). We further measured delta C-13 values of 13 ephippia from surface sediments of three Swiss lakes. In the well-oxygenated lake with low methane concentrations, delta C-13 values are close to values typical for algae (-31.4 parts per thousand) and the range in values is relatively small (5.8 parts per thousand). This variability is likely driven by seasonal (or inter-annual) variability in algae delta C-13 values. In two seasonally anoxic lakes with higher methane concentrations, average values were lower (-41.4 and 43.9 parts per thousand, respectively) and the ranges much larger (10.7 and 20.0 parts per thousand). We attribute this variability to seasonal variation in incorporation of methane-derived carbon. In one lake we identify two statistically distinct isotopic populations, which may reflect separate production peaks. The potentially large within-sample variability should be considered when interpreting small-amplitude, short-lived isotope excursions based on samples consisting of few ephippia. We show that measurements on single ephippia can be performed using laser ablation, which allows for refined assessments of past Daphnia diet and carbon cycling in lake food webs. Furthermore, our study provides a basis for similar measurements on other chitinous remains (e.g. from chironomids, bryozoans). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to achieve this goal, we established a hydrological regime assessment method based on a set of hydrological indicators for lakes with heavy seasonal water level fluctuations. The results suggest that time-sensitive hydrological indicators and specific time scales for various water security aspects must be considered. We discovered that it is more practical and meaningful to combine the water level classification derived from statistical analyses with characteristic hydrological values linked to water security. The case study of Poyang Lake results show that there are no discernable trends of Poyang Lake water regime status over the last 35 years, and the two periods of poor status are in accordance with climate variation in the lake basin area. Scholars and policy makers should focus on both floods and droughts, which are the main water security problems for Poyang Lake. It is hoped that this multi-scale and multi-element hydrological regime assessment method will provide new guidelines and methods for other international scholars of river and lake water assessment.					dai, xue/KFB-3128-2024														1002-0063	1993-064X				JUN	2018	28	3					456	469		10.1007/s11769-018-0958-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-018-0958-2													WOS:000431266700009

The large pulses of Lathyrus or Vicia sp. recovered from this shallow cave in the southwest of Iran may, for instance, represent food collected from wild stands already in the early Upper Palaeolithic. The seeds of barley (Hordeum sp.), although not all clearly domesticated, are without doubt signs of disturbance or bioturbation since the historic era. Analysis of cave deposits over 30,000 years old raise a number of methodological and interpretive challenges. Human, taphonomic, or biomechanical disturbances impact the deposition of plant remains, as well as affect the composition of the assemblages, undermining spatial and ecological examination of the data set. Comprehension of provenance of the samples, site genesis, and matrix development, through detailed micromorphological and stratigraphical studies, is thus suggested in conjunction with the archaeobotanical analyses, to identify disturbances, define their cause, and treat them appropriately. Numerical studies and ecological interpretations of climate, vegetation composition, or indications of human activity therefore follow specific criteria discussed here. Despite signs of disturbance in the plant assemblages, archaeobotanic research can lead to recognition of environmental conditions, plausible human subsistence, site use and seasonality, and sound vegetation description.					; Conard, Nicholas/IAN-0808-2023; Riehl, Simone/AAI-5815-2020	Zeidi, Mohsen/0000-0002-4718-9555; Conard, Nicholas/0000-0002-4633-0385; Riehl, Simone/0000-0002-1744-0032; 													1866-9557	1866-9565				JUN	2015	7	2					245	256		10.1007/s12520-014-0191-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12520-014-0191-6													WOS:000355337600006
J	Pikosz, M; Messyasz, B				Pikosz, Marta; Messyasz, Beata			Composition and seasonal changes in filamentous algae in floating mats	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The occurrence of algal-cyanobacterial metaphyton mats in field (Konojad village) and artificial ponds (Poznan city) was investigated in the Wielkopolska region. The surface area of algal mats ranged between ca. 45% (natural pond) and 10% (artificial pond) of the total water surface, and the mats occurred from the water surface to the bottom; the algal diversity was similar in both types of ponds, i.e. about 10 taxa. The most frequently recorded and dominant taxa in small water bodies were: Spirogyra spp., Cladophora fracta in the artificial pond and Oedogonium spp., Cladophora rivularis in the natural pond. The dynamics of macroalgae demonstrated a pattern comprising different phases of taxa dominance. For example, April regarded as the first phase was characterized by a small amount of metaphyton, represented by Tribonema and Ulothrix taxa. In May, these species disappeared and were replaced by: Oedogonium spp. and Cladophora spp. which formed large aggregations in the field pond, and Spirogyra spp. which abundantly proliferated in the artificial pond. From June, however, Oedogonium and/or Cladophora significantly dominated in the mat structure and at the same time covered a large area of the water surface. The algal community was dominated by common algal taxa, among which single filaments of other taxa could also occur.

Spatial and temporal variability of turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, and fluorescence in the lower Mekong River-Tonle Sap system identified using continuous monitoring	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												Continuous monitoring of turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, temperature, and fluorescence was done at five locations on the Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong-Bassac Rivers near Phnom Penh, Cambodia, between 2004 and 2010 using autonomous datasondes. Seasonal, daily, and spatial trends were clearly identified in the data and were related to the annual monsoon rainy season-dry season cycle, system metabolism, system hydraulics, and in some cases, localized phenomena such as waste discharges. The datasondes were particularly useful to track the oxygenation of anoxic black water areas in the flooded forest fringe of the Tonle Sap that occurred during the rainy season freshwater pulse. A strongly developed vertical variation of turbidity, DO, and conductivity in the flooded forest fringe may be related to a combination of factors, including dissolved material release from bed sediment and a floating organic-rich particulate layer near the bottom of the lake. Grab samples for total suspended solids (TSS) were collected at the Preak Leap (PL) site (Mekong River) in 2009 and 2010. An excellent relationship was established between daily mean turbidity and TSS concentration for the PL site, with r(2) = 0.95. Autoregressive, integrated, moving average models adequately forecast water level and water quality data one month ahead.

GIS-Based Study on the Environmental Sensitivity to Pollution and Susceptibility to Eutrophication in Burullus Lake, Egypt	MARINE GEODESY												Sensitivity to pollution in Burullus Lake was estimated based on the proximity analysis. The category of sensitivity was based on six factors including: agricultural areas, industrial areas, drains, Elboughaz, urban areas and fish farms. A statistical model was developed to estimate trophic state index (TSI) based on laboratory measurements of water samples at two different periods of time (Mach 2020 and June 2020) (R-2 = 0.96 and 0.94, respectively). The important factors that were considered at the first period were chlorophyll, phosphate PO4 and oxidizable organic matter OOM. In the second period, the considered factors were ammonia NH4, silicates SiO4, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The category of TSI varied from oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic conditions in March 2020, whereas it varied from eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic in June 2020. The eutrophication condition was higher in June than in March. This may be attributed to the huge amount of wastewaters, their contaminant load and season. The compatibility between sensitivity model and the obtained results in March 2020 was about 54.5%, whereas it was about 27.3% in June 2020. This reveals that the lake is highly sensitive to pollution and therefore it needs to be monitored regularly.

Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the Selenga river delta were modelled based on LandSat images data. The seasonal variability in suspended sediment retention during the period 1989 to 2015 was calculated. The results suggest that sediment storage in the Selenga delta is observed during high discharges (> 1500 m(3) s(-1)), whereas sediment export increases under lower flow conditions (< 1500 m(3) s(-1)). The changes in seasonal SSC patterns are explained by wetland inundation during floods and channel erosion or Baikal wind surge during low flow periods.

However, in addition to the negative effects that dams have on the water quality of rivers, other practices such as discharge of untreated wastewater, intensive crop fertilization and fish farming have been contributing to water quality deterioration. Climate change may be another driver of water quality decrease. Increases in precipitation and drought intensities as well as temperature increase may redefine the dynamics of planktonic communities and favour species more adapted to the new environment. Water samples were collected in two reservoirs selected based on the recurrence of positive results for saxitoxins, Acarape do Meio (AM) and Sitios Novos (SN). In general, diversity in SN (1.08) was higher than in the AM (0.60). Phytoplankton dynamics in these reservoirs differ from other reservoirs in the same region of Brazil, in the sense that filamentous cyanobacteria are dominant. Furthermore, lower diversity, concentration and richness of chlorophyceae and bacillariophyceae were found in both reservoirs. Increase in diversity was observed during the intense rainy season of 2011, suggesting a slight improvement of water quality. A close inverse correlation between Cylindrospermopsis sp and other cyanobacteria was found in SN (R-2=-0.862) and in AM (R-2=-0.997) and the data collected demonstrates that a season with intensive rainfall may lead to lower cyanobacteria concentrations probably due to water dilution and higher flushing rates.					; Capelo-Neto, Jose/AAG-7439-2020	Barros, Mario/0000-0001-5763-8951; Capelo-Neto, Jose/0000-0002-7669-7153; 													1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								e6	10.1590/2318-0331.011716072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/2318-0331.011716072													WOS:000424560900007

Genetic divergence of the mitochondrial COI and ND2 genes and nuclear S7 gene support the distinction of the new species from its closest known relative, N. rosenstocki and confirms its position in the N. brieni species group.					; Cotterill, Fenton/A-1326-2009	Nagy, Bela/0000-0003-4718-0822; Bellstedt, Dirk/0000-0002-6376-4855; van der Merwe, Pieter De Wet/0000-0001-9315-599X; 													1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	3					201	218		10.2989/16085914.2017.1372270	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2017.1372270													WOS:000416745200001

However, a regional perspective, such as the one employed in this paper, allows us to identify trends and patterns during the Late Holocene (last 2,500 years) that could remain in the shadows if a microregional scale alone were used. Climatic changes occurred during the Late Holocene and specifically during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), ca. 900 BP that were very different from the preceding times. It was proposed that lower lacustrine basins (lowlands) were residentially used by hunter-gatherer populations while the high basaltic plateaus (highlands) show an archaeological signal related to a seasonal logistic strategy. Consequently, it is expected that regional archaeozoological records obtained in different type of basins should follow these archaeological patterns. Spatial distribution of the zooarchaeological record present important differences between the Middle and Late Holocene in terms of skeletal part frequencies and processing evidence that is in agreement with the proposal.

Mixed stock analysis of Lake Michigan's Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis commercial fishery	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) support the primary commercial fishery in Lake Michigan. Discrete genetic stocks of lake whitefish have been identified and tagging data suggest stocks are mixed throughout much of the year. Our objectives were to determine if (1) differential stock harvest occurs in the commercial catch, (2) spatial differences in genetic composition of harvested fish were present, and (3) seasonal differences were present in the harvest by commercial fisheries that operate in management zones WI-2 and WFM-01 (Green Bay, Lake Michigan). Mixed stock analysis was conducted on 17 commercial harvest samples (n = 78-145/sample) collected from various ports lake-wide during 2009-2010. Results showed significant mixing with variability in stock composition across most samples. Samples consisted of two to four genetic stocks each accounting for >= 10% the catch. In 10 of 17 samples, the stock contributing the largest proportion made up <60% of the harvest. In general, seasonal and annual differences existed in the proportional stock contribution at a single capture location. Samples from Wisconsin's primary commercial fishing management zone (WI-2) were composed predominately of fish from the Big Bay de Noc (Michigan) stock as opposed to the geographically proximate, North-Moonlight Bay (Wisconsin) stock. These findings have implications for management and allocation of fish to various quotas. Specifically, geographic location of harvest, the current means of allocating harvest quotas, is not the best predictor of genetic stock harvest.

Casting your network wide: a plea to scale-up phenological research	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Accumulating scientific evidence has demonstrated widespread shifts in the biological seasons. These shifts may modify seasonal interspecific interactions, with consequent impacts upon reproductive success and survival. However, current understanding of these impacts is based upon a limited number of studies that adopt a simplified 'bottom-up' food-chain paradigm, at a local scale. I argue that there is much insight to be gained by widening the scope of phenological studies to incorporate food-web interactions and landscape-scale processes across a diversity of ecosystem types, with the ultimate goal of developing a generic understanding of the systems most vulnerable to synchrony effects in the future. I propose that co-location of predator and prey phenological monitoring at sentinel sites, acting as research platforms for detailed food-web studies, experimentation and match-up with earth observation data, would be an important first step in this endeavour.

Synoptic-Scale Forcing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Synoptic typing is a method of classifying atmospheric conditions (i.e., pressure, temperature, wind direction) and can be used to relate those conditions to terrestrial processes. In this study, a daily synoptic calendar was developed for the northeastern United States to assess the atmospheric controls on variations in stream chemistry across three forested watersheds in Vermont, Rhode Island, and Maryland. Stream discharge along with dissolved organic carbon and nitrate concentrations were monitored in situ from March to November for 3 years (2014-2016) and then compared to the regional daily synoptic calendar to assess (a) which atmospheric patterns exported the greatest flux of water and solutes, (b) whether all three watersheds responded similarly to the regional atmospheric patterns, and (c) how these fluxes changed seasonally. Seven broad categories of atmospheric patterns were identified. In general, low pressure systems situated over the Great Lakes region produced the most rainfall which resulted in the highest peak streamflow by event along with daily fluxes of DOC and NO3--N across the watersheds. In contrast, southwest flow regimes and Northwest Flow regimes occurred the most frequently (36% and 14% of study days, respectively) and resulted in the largest overall export (+50% of total) of water and solutes from the three watersheds. Regardless of watershed size or location, streamflow dynamics were similar when classified using synoptic typing. As such, valuable insight into the meteorological mechanisms behind temporal variation in carbon and nitrate stream export in forested watersheds can be gained by employing regional synoptic weather analyses. Key Points Synoptic-scale weather patterns are associated with terrestrial stream dynamics at the regional scale Regardless of watershed size or location within the study region, water and solute fluxes were similarly classified using synoptic typing Storms from more frequent synoptic types dominated water and solute fluxes compared to storms from larger, infrequent synoptic types					; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Addy, Kelly/0000-0002-5590-3616; Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; Siegert, Courtney/0000-0001-9804-3858; Suriano, Zachary/0000-0001-7574-0191; Schroth, Andrew/0000-0001-5553-3208; Inamdar, Shreeram/0000-0001-5958-7684; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 8	2021	126	13							e2020JD033413	10.1029/2020JD033413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD033413													WOS:000704189400019

Functional diversity approaches have been an efficient tool in gaining a better understanding of how environmental conditions selected species in a given environment and how they share resources, linking ecological processes to biodiversity patterns. Although most of the protist ciliates are not highly specialized, functional feeding groups with species which ingest similar food can be identified. Thus, this study aimed to compare the abundance of different Functional Feeding Groups (FFG) of ciliates in environments with different hydrodynamic conditions (lotic and lentic) in different hydrological periods (high and low water) in a neotropical flood plain. The samples for analysis of the community of ciliates were taken in March and September of 2010 and 2011, at the subsurface of 12 different hydrodynamic environments. The results of an RDA showed a spatial and temporal segregation of the sampling units, based on the abundance and occurrence of the FFG. In addition, a clear influence of food resources on the structuring of functional ciliate guilds was evidenced. Thus, there were both temporal (hydrological periods) and spatial (different hydrodynamic environments) differences in the distribution of the FFG, with a clear separation of the FFGs between the years studied. In summary, the results of the categorization of species of ciliates in FFG responded satisfactorily suggesting fluctuations in different food resources, which reinforces the idea that the grouping of species by functional characteristics can be a good indicator of the responses of organisms to environmental fluctuations.					; Velho, Luiz Felipe/I-9130-2016; PROGENIO, MELISSA/LSI-9247-2024; Rodrigues, Luzia/B-7856-2017; Lansac-Toha, Fábio/I-3556-2016; Guimarães, Carolina/LBH-9458-2024; Lansac-Toha, Fernando/E-8817-2018; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide/B-7856-2017; Velho, Luiz Felipe Machado/I-9130-2016	Meira, Bianca/0000-0003-4961-038X; Lansac-Toha, Fabio/0000-0001-6746-8052; Duran, Carolina/0000-0001-6464-5260; Correa Leite, Edilaine/0000-0001-8071-4166; Progenio, Melissa/0000-0002-0083-3358; Rodrigues, Luzia Cleide/0000-0002-0593-0931; Velho, Luiz Felipe Machado/0000-0001-8111-4955													0003-4088	2100-000X				JUL 6	2021	57								13	10.1051/limn/2021009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2021009													WOS:000670038800001
J	Apolinarska, K; Hammarlund, D				Apolinarska, Karina; Hammarlund, Dan			Multi-component stable isotope records from Late Weichselian and early Holocene lake sediments at Imiolki, Poland: palaeoclimatic and methodological implications	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Late Weichselian and early Holocene climatic and environmental changes are inferred from stable carbon and oxygen isotope records obtained on bulk and biogenic carbonates from the sediment sequence of Lake Lednica, western Poland. Along with sediment and pollen stratigraphic data, a wide range of carbonate components occurring in the sediments was analysed for delta C-13 and delta O-18, including shells of several gastropod species and the bivalve genus Pisidium, carapaces of the ostracod subfamily Candoninae and oogonia of the aquatic macrophyte genus Chara. The development of catchment soils and the onset of authigenic carbonate production in response to the climatic amelioration during the Late Weichselian are clearly reflected by rising carbonate content, distinct isotopic shifts in bulk carbonates and decreasing delta C-13 values of bulk organic matter in the sediments. The GI-1/GS-1 (the Bolling-Allerod Interstadial complex/Younger Dryas Stadial) and the GS-1/Preboreal transitions are marked by significant shifts in delta O-18 values of 2-3 parts per thousand, as well as by distinct changes in carbonate content, indicative of a decrease and a subsequent increase in mean annual temperature. Corresponding delta C-13 records reflect primarily changes in aquatic productivity, with favourable conditions for phytoplankton and macrophytes during GI-1 and the Preboreal resulting in persistent C-13 enrichment. The Younger Dryas Stadial is characterised by depletions in C-13 and O-18, with indications of a climatic tripartition. Consistent offsets in delta C-13 and delta O-18 between records obtained on specific carbonate components reflect vital effects in combination with seasonal characteristics and habitat preferences of the respective carbonate-precipitating biota. Largely parallel first-order variations in delta C-13 and delta O-18 of the different carbonate components demonstrate that individual isotope records may provide important palaeoclimatic information, although more detailed reconstructions can be obtained from multi-component analysis.

PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION OF WETLANDS WITHIN AN UPLAND FOREST	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Though often overlooked, small wetlands in an upland matrix can support diverse plant communities that increase both local and regional species richness. Here we characterize the full range of wetland vegetation within an upland forest landscape and compare the diversity and composition of different wetland plant communities. In an old-growth forest reserve in southern Quebec, Canada, we sampled wet habitats including lakeshores, permanent and seasonal ponds, swamps, glades, and streamsides. We used clustering, indicator species analysis, and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination to identify and compare vegetation types. The wetlands contained 280 species of vascular plants, 45% of the reserve's flora, in only 1.1% of its area. Local diversity averaged 24 +/- 0.7 species per 7 m(2), much higher than in the surrounding upland forests. Plant communities sorted into five types, whose strongest indicator species were Osmunda regalis, Glyceria striata, O.cinnamomea, Deparia acrostichoides, and Matteuccia struthiopteris, respectively. Both local species, richness and compositional variation among sites differed among the vegetation types. By combining species representative of the region's major wetlands with species from the upland forest matrix, the plant assemblages of these wetlands make disproportionately important contributions to landscape-level diversity.

J	Vallet-Coulomb, C; Gasse, F; Sonzogni, C				Vallet-Coulomb, Christine; Gasse, Francoise; Sonzogni, Corinne			Seasonal evolution of the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour above a tropical lake: Deuterium excess and implication for water recycling	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We present an analysis of the rainfall-evaporation-atmospheric moisture cycle in a semi-arid tropical zone (southwestern Madagascar) to quantify the recycling and mixing processes that occur above an endorheic lake system (Lake Ihotry) during an annual cycle. The study combines an isotope mass balance with a detailed field investigation of the lake system and a previously established daily time-step lake water balance model. The mass balance and Craig-Gordon equations are used to calculate the isotopic composition of the evaporative flux from the take surface (delta(E)) and to derive a daily time series of the ambient atmospheric water vapour composition above the lake (delta(AL)) during a 8-month dry season. Calculated delta(AL) results from a mixing between regional moisture (delta(AR)) and locally evaporated water (delta(E)), the latter representing 50% of delta(AL) at the end of the dry season. The contribution of recycled moisture to on-take precipitation during the wet season is estimated to >= 16%. We show that, as expected, the deuterium excess is high in recycled precipitation and low in evaporated precipitation, but also that the recycled moisture in an endorheic system may have a low deuterium excess resulting from the low deuterium excess in regional precipitation. In case of a long evaporative season, the atmospheric moisture is not in isotopic equilibrium with the annual composition of precipitation because of the contribution of the recycled vapour to the local atmospheric pool. Our approach demonstrates the importance of water recycling on the atmospheric moisture cycle and precipitation in a tropical semi-arid system, and can be applied to other natural systems, enlarging the potential range of investigation of the atmospheric vapour cycle and rainfall sources in tropical lands. It may also represent a valuable complement to direct water vapour sampling, in yielding the long-term evolution of the atmospheric vapour composition with spatially averaged values and smoothed temporal variations.

Passive water sampling and air-water diffusive exchange of long-range transported semi-volatile organic pollutants in high-mountain lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The concentrations of legacy and currently emitted organic pollutants were determined in the freely dissolved phase of water from six high-mountain lakes in the Pyrenees (1619-2453 m) by passive water sampling. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and silicone rubber (SR) sheets were exposed for three consecutive periods lasting each one year between 2017 and 2020 for the study of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organophosphate esters (OPEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other organochlorine compounds (e.g., hexachlorobenzene, HCB). HCB concentrations (1.0-14 pg L-1) remained essentially the same as those measured with pumping systems over two decades ago in the same area. Sigma PAHs (35-920 pg L-1) were around half of those observed in the past, which agrees with reductions in European atmospheric emissions. Sigma PCB concentrations (1.2-2.2 pg L-1) were substantially lower, although unexpectedly large differences could be due to comparing yearly averages from the present study to seasonally variable (i.e., affected by snowmelt, stratification, and colloidal organic matter) episodic pumping measurements from previous studies. Sigma OPEs (139-2849 pg L-1) were measured for the first time in this area and were found at high concentrations in some sites. Concentrations of most compounds obtained with LDPE and SR samplers agreed with each other by ratios generally lower than three or four times, except for a few PAHs and OPEs. Diffusive exchange flux calculations between the atmospheric gas phase and the freely dissolved water phase revealed net deposition of pollutants from air to water, except for some OPEs and PCBs presenting equilibrium conditions, and HCB with volatilization fluxes. Atmospheric degradation fluxes of PAHs and OPEs pointed at competing removal mechanisms that support the air-to-water direction of their diffusive exchange, while PCBs and organochlorines were not affected by photodegradation. In their current state, these remote lakes accumulate many emerging and legacy pollutants subject to long-range atmospheric transport.					; van Drooge, Barend/AAZ-9084-2021; Grimalt, Joan/E-2073-2011; Fernandez, Pilar/E-6182-2010	Prats, Raimon M./0000-0002-4312-3540; van Drooge, Barend L./0000-0002-6434-3390; Fernandez, Pilar/0000-0002-4535-5214													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 20	2023	860								160509	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160509		JAN 2023						36436648					WOS:000921798100001

The drivers of anguillid eel movement in lentic water bodies: a systematic map	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Anguillid eels are near globally distributed catadromous fishes with marine spawning areas and inshore and inland growth areas in both lotic (rivers, estuaries) and lentic (lakes, ponds, lagoons) water bodies. As predators, anguillid eels play an important ecological role in both marine and freshwater systems, and several species are harvested commercially for food. However, some of the more widely distributed species have undergone severe declines in recruitment and their population status is now of significant concern. Given the multiple and lengthy migrations undertaken by anguillid eels, understanding of the drivers of movement is fundamental for species conservation and management. Yet, despite the importance of lentic systems to their ecology, most studies on anguillid eel movement have been conducted in lotic systems. Given that key influences on eel migration in lotic water bodies, such as fluctuations in flow and water temperature, may be minimised in lentic environments, the transferability of findings between lotic and lentic systems cannot be assumed. A systematic map was constructed to synthesise current knowledge on the extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of anguillid eel movement in lentic systems. The current state of knowledge of the drivers of eel movement in lentic systems is presented and compared to the relatively well-understood drivers of movement in lotic systems. We also discuss current knowledge gaps and limitations, and identify key future research requirements to inform the management and conservation of anguillid eels in understudied lentic systems.= [GRAPHICS]					; Williamson, Michael/GRR-3031-2022	Piper, Adam/0000-0002-9027-3066; Williamson, Michael/0000-0001-9681-8920; Jacoby, David/0000-0003-2729-3811													0960-3166	1573-5184				MAR	2023	33	1					147	174		10.1007/s11160-022-09751-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-022-09751-6		JAN 2023											WOS:000911001400001

The spatiotemporal characteristics of the net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation are explored from the perspective of the city's functional position, providing important insights for the city to achieve the dual-carbon target and green development. The study evaluates the spatiotemporal variations in NPP from 2003 to 2022 in the eco-urban agglomeration around Poyang Lake, using the CASA model. Its variation characteristics were explored in detail from a completely new perspective and scope using indicators such as cycle amplitudes, CV coefficients, Hurst indices, and others. Results indicate seasonal fluctuations and significant variations between urban areas and vegetation, with implications for sustainable development. The annual NPP ranged from 200 to 800 gC/(m2<middle dot>a), with a change rate of 0.58 gC/(m2<middle dot>a) and evident seasonal fluctuations in the study area. Notably, urban core cities like Jiujiang and Nanchang exhibit lower NPP and decreasing trends. Scenic areas showed high forest cover and vigorous NPP changes, highlighting the need for targeted urban ecological management to enhance green development. Additionally, the seasonal fluctuations in NPP were notably influenced by specific land use types and local economic conditions. In areas with high vegetation cover, the seasonal characteristics of NPP are pronounced, while they are less evident in regions with strong urban economic conditions.

We investigate how climatic factors influence seasonal baseflow in 7138 global catchments across five major climate regions. Our analysis identifies precipitation as the primary driver, affecting 58.3% of catchments, though its impact varies significantly across different climates. In temperate regions, precipitation dominates (61.9% of catchments), while in tropical regions, evaporative demand is the leading factor (47.3%). Snow fraction is particularly crucial in both snow-dominated (20.8%) and polar regions (48.5%). Negative baseflow trends generally emerge where the effects of evaporative demand or snow fraction outweigh those of precipitation. Specifically, in northern regions and the Rocky Mountains, where snow fraction predominantly controls baseflow changes, a negative trend is evident. Similarly, in tropical catchments, where evaporative demand drives baseflow changes, this also leads to a negative trend. Additionally, our findings indicate that baseflow changes are closely linked to hydrologic drought severity, with concurrent trends observed in 69% of catchments. These findings highlight the relationship between baseflow changes, the severity of hydrologic drought and shifts in precipitation, evaporative demand, and snow dynamics. This study provides crucial insights for sustainable water resource planning and climate change adaptation, emphasizing the importance of managing groundwater-fed river flows to mitigate drought impacts.					; Simões Ballarin, André/JHU-4867-2023; Papalexiou, Simon Michael/HZM-4788-2023	Hatami, Shadi/0000-0002-0048-8144; Simoes Ballarin, Andre/0000-0001-6997-8662; Zaerpour, Masoud/0000-0002-5986-1628													1748-9326					JAN 1	2025	20	1							014035	10.1088/1748-9326/ad975a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad975a													WOS:001379289100001

Similarly, glaciers in the Astore Basin are melting, causing glacial lakes to expand faster, new lakes to form, and increasing the risk of glacial lakes outburst floods (GLOFs). The present study uses Landsat data from 1993 to 2021 to explore seasonal and decadal changes in glacier lakes, which are validated using an in situ differential Global Positioning System (dGPS). During the ablation period (June - October) of 2021, we observed a five-fold increase (18 to 100) in the number of glacier lakes, as well as a six-fold increase (0.62 to 3.86 km2) in lakes larger than 0.01 km2. Over the last decade, from 2011 to 2020, the number of potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs) has doubled. GLOF risk must be reduced through continual monitoring of these lakes. Prioritizing the deployment of GLOF monitoring and early warning systems, as well as sustainable water management practices, is critical for mitigation and adaptation measures in mountainous regions.

Lake Ekoln is located south of Uppsala and is the basin of Lake Ma<spacing diaeresis>laren; Lake Ma<spacing diaeresis>laren is the third largest lake in Sweden and is the drinking water source for more than two million people. The aim of this study was to simulate the fate and transport of PFAS in Lake Ekoln during the period 2017-2020 using three-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling. The simulated water temperatures were in agreement with the observed water temperatures. The simulated PFAS concentrations were generally in agreement with the available measurements, but the lack of measurements made the comparison uncertain. The modelling results described the seasonal variations of PFAS in Lake Ekoln informing the operation of the drinking water treatment plants located downstream. The modelling results confirmed that the main inflow to the lake - the river Fyris & aring;n - is the main source of PFAS to Lake Ekoln, highlighting the importance of mitigating this source in the context of ensuring safe drinking water supply in the Stockholm region. Regular monitoring of PFAS in the river Fyris & aring;n is needed, and additional measurements in Lake Ekoln would facilitate further model development.					; Ahrens, Lutz/S-6266-2019	Ahrens, Lutz/0000-0002-5430-6764; Sokolova, Ekaterina/0000-0002-5715-8007; Prajapati, Prajwol/0009-0005-2686-9606; Bondelind, Mia/0000-0002-8782-1789													0269-7491	1873-6424				FEB 15	2025	367								125581	10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125581		DEC 2024						39725198					WOS:001421373300001

Correlation and spatial cluster analysis of residuals of linear fits through cumulative velocity time series, revealed that velocity variations were controlled by the intra-annual outer tropical seasonality and inter-annual variation in Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies (SSTA), related to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The seasonal signal was dominant, where it was sensitive to altitude, aspect, and slope. The measured velocity variations are related to the spatial and temporal variability of the glacier's surface energy and mass balance, meltwater production, and subglacial water pressures. Evaluation of potential ice avalanche initiation areas, using deviations from linear long-term velocity trends, which were not related to intra- or inter-annual velocities, showed no evidence of imminent avalanching ice instabilities for the observation period.

Intraguild predation between spawning smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and nest-raiding crayfish (Orconectes rusticus): implications for bass nesting success	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Predation on eggs is often assumed to be a primary factor influencing the reproductive success of fish. However, complex interactions between nesting fish and their egg predators may influence reproductive success in unexpected ways. The invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) engage in reciprocal predation during the bass spawning season; the net impact on bass reproduction is poorly understood. We hypothesise that the rates of nest abandonment and bass guarding behaviour will be positively related to crayfish abundance and that bass consumption of crayfish will mitigate energy loss due to nest guarding against crayfish. We tracked 62 bass nests throughout a spawning season in a north temperate lake with an established population of O. rusticus. Using video surveillance, we observed bass nest-guarding behaviour and crayfish predation on bass nests, reconstructed bass diets using faecal remains and made repeated measurements of mass and length for a subset of the parental bass. Results were consistent with all hypotheses. Nest abandonment rate and guarding activity were higher in areas with higher crayfish density. More than 95% of bass consumed crayfish while on the nest and bass condition factor increased during nesting, suggesting that energy consumed exceeded energy expended in defending the nest. The lakewide rate of smallmouth bass nest abandonment was 13%, which is lower than most published observations for this species. While high densities of nest-raiding crayfish can reduce nesting success, our limited observations indicate that consumption of crayfish may mitigate rates of nest abandonment by bass. Unexpected outcomes of complex interactions, such as reciprocal predation, should be considered when predicting population trajectories of native and invasive species.					; Lodge, David/AAX-1781-2021	Elgin, Ashley/0000-0001-5728-9843; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2013	58	11					2355	2365		10.1111/fwb.12215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12215													WOS:000325156400013

Cholera incidence was highest in the eastern provinces bordering lakes and epidemics primarily originated in this region. Along with a strong seasonal component, our data suggest a potential Vibrio cholerae reservoir in the Rift Valley lakes and the possible contribution of the lakes' fishing industry to the spread of cholera. The National Ministry of Health has committed to the elimination-rather than control-of cholera in DRC and has adopted a new national policy built on improved alert, response, case management, and prevention. To achieve this goal and implement all these measures it will require strong partners in the international community with a similar vision.																			0022-1899	1537-6613				NOV 1	2013	208			1			S86	S91		10.1093/infdis/jit204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jit204								24101651					WOS:000325766800013
J	Matori, A; Basith, A; Harahap, ISH				Matori, Abd Nasir; Basith, Abdul; Harahap, Indra Sati Hamonangan			Study of regional monsoonal effects on landslide hazard zonation in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												In general, landslides in Malaysia mostly occurred during northeast and southwest periods, two monsoonal systems that bring heavy rain. As the consequence, most landslide occurrences were induced by rainfall. This paper reports the effect of monsoonal-related geospatial data in landslide hazard modeling in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia, using Geographic Information System (GIS). Land surface temperature (LST) data was selected as the monsoonal rainfall footprints on the land surface. Four LST maps were derived from Landsat 7 thermal band acquired at peaks of dry and rainy seasons in 2001. The landslide factors chosen from topography map were slope, slope aspect, curvature, elevation, land use, proximity to road, and river/lake; while from geology map were lithology and proximity to lineament. Landslide characteristics were extracted by crossing between the landslide sites of Cameron Highlands and landslide factors. Using which, the weighting system was derived. Each landslide factors were divided into five subcategories. The highest weight values were assigned to those having the highest number of landslide occurrences. Weighted overlay was used as GIS operator to generate landslide hazard maps. GIS analysis was performed in two modes: (1) static mode, using all factors except LST data; (2) dynamic mode, using all factors including multi-temporal LST data. The effect of addition of LST maps was evaluated. The final landslide hazard maps were divided into five categories: very high risk, high risk, moderate, low risk, and very low risk. From verification process using landslide map, the landslide model can predict back about 13-16% very high risk sites and 70-93% of very high risk and high risk combined together. It was observed however that inclusion of LST maps does not necessarily increase the accuracy of the landslide model to predict landslide sites.

J	Lee, CC				Lee, Cameron C.			Utilizing synoptic climatological methods to assess the impacts of climate change on future tornado-favorable environments	NATURAL HAZARDS												Previous research into the impacts of climate change on severe mid-latitude weather has been limited by the spatial resolution of many important variables in global climate model output. By utilizing synoptic climatological methods, however, this research takes an entirely different approach. Using a six-step process that includes principal components analysis, cluster analysis, and discriminant function analysis, this study first creates a continental-scale map pattern classification at three levels of the atmosphere, from geopotential height and temperature fields. These patterns are then associated to historic F2 and stronger United States' tornado days using binary logistic regression. Using output data from two GCMs, spanning five different model emissions scenarios, this synoptic climatology of tornadoes is then utilized in order to project the changes in the frequency and seasonality of tornadic environments due to a changing climate. Results indicate that F2 and stronger US tornado days will increase anywhere from 3.8 to 12.7% by the 2090s. The majority of this increase is likely to be manifested in the earlier part of the tornado season. In addition to the shift in seasonality, a broadening of the peak tornado season is also noticed under some scenarios. Geographically, portions of the Northern and Central Plains, the High Plains, the Lower Great Lakes, the Mid-Atlantic States, and the Southeast are projected to experience an increase in tornado days under some future scenarios. The Upper Great Lakes states and the Southern Plains are projected to experience a decrease in tornado days.					; Lee, Cameron/GPP-3918-2022	Lee, Cameron/0000-0002-5380-6601; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				JUN	2012	62	2					325	343		10.1007/s11069-011-9998-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-011-9998-y													WOS:000304112700011

Despite their importance, little is known about the structure of the zooplankton communities of subtropic, large, shallow, eutrophic freshwater lakes. Our investigation of zooplankton communities in Lake Taihu, a subtropic, shallow, eutrophic lake and the third largest lake in China provides new information on this subject. Zooplankton, phytoplankton, and water chemistry samples were collected monthly from July 2006 to June 2007 in Meiliang and Gonghu Bays of Lake Taihu. Thirty zooplankton species were identified in Meiliang Bay with small-bodied cladocerans Bosmina coregoni and Ceriodaphnia cornuta contributing 21% and 11%, respectively to total zooplankton abundance which averaged 459 ind/L. Thirty-five species were identified in Gonghu Bay with the rotifers Polyarthra trigla and Brachionus calyciflorus the dominant species, contributing 21% and 11% respectively to total zooplankton abundance which averaged 467 ind/L. Predation by lake anchovy (Coilia ectenes taihuensis) and ice fish (Neosalanx tangkahkeii taihuensis) likely accounted for the dominance of both bays by small-bodied species. Community structure and community patterns were correlated with differences in Microcystis blooms and organic matter levels (chemical oxygen demand) in the two bays. Based on canonical correspondence analyses dissolved total nitrogen, orthophosphate, Cyclotella and Pinnularia, also contributed to variability in zooplankton community composition.

Residual circulation due to internal waves shoaling on a slope	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We describe the residual circulation induced in a two-layer system when internal waves, with a wave length equal to or longer than the slope length, propagate over a sloping bottom and either reflect or break. For the case of no wave breaking, scaling is used to derive Boussinesq-type equations, the solution of which leads to an expression for the residual circulation adjacent to the sloping bottom. This residual circulation is maintained by a weak slope on the density interface. For breaking waves, laboratory experiments and numerical modeling were used to ascertain the details of the residual circulation arising from the formation of gravitational intrusions. Results from these three investigative tools were used to determine, as a function of bottom slope and incident wave amplitude, the internal wave reflection coefficient and the strength of the residual circulation pattern with and without wave breaking.

Study of the microbial diversity of Oreochromis niloticus of three lakes of Cameroon by PCR-DGGE: Application to the determination of the geographical origin	FOOD CONTROL												The new European regulation 178/2002 imposes the determination of the geographical origin in the traceability process of the foodstuffs at the moment of commercial transactions. In practice, it is difficult to determine with accuracy the geographical origin of foodstuffs. For this purpose, the total analysis of the bacterial communities in samples is used. In the present Study the molecular technique using 16S rDNA profiles generated by PCR-DGGE Was used in order to detect the variation in bacterial community structures of Tilapia fish from three different lakes of the north of Cameroon and the effect of the season and fish species on these bacteria profiles. The V3 region of bacterial rDNA from fish was amplified by PCR and was analyzed by DGGE. When the 16S rDNA profiles were analysed by multivariate analysis, distinct microbial Communities were detected. The hands profiles obtained from different lakes were different and specific for each location and Could be used as a bar code to certify the origin of the fish. The fish specie did not have an influence on microbial profiles of fish contrarily to the season. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Certain environmental variables, such as turbidity, suspended solids, and water level, formed seasonal spatial gradients in Itapeva Lake, southern Brazil, in response to wind action. Physical variables formed gradients more easily than did most of the plankton community, although the densities of certain species did respond to wind-driven oscillations. The results of this analysis indicate that the spatial and temporal gradients experienced by the physical, chemical, and biological descriptors displayed a characteristic property of this type of wind-driven environment.

The responses of plankton communities and food consumption of silver and bighead carp were studied. Crustacean zooplankton were significantly suppressed in the fish pens. Total phytoplankton biomass, Microcystis biomass and microcystin concentration were lower in the fish pens than in the surrounding lake water, but the difference was not statistically significant. The present stocking density of silver plus bighead carp (about 40 g/m(3) in July) was likely too low to achieve an adequate control of Microcystis. Silver carp fed mainly on phytoplankton but bighead carp mainly on zooplankton: mean zooplankton contribution in the gut was 31.5% for silver carp and 64.7% for bighead carp. Compared with previous studies, both carp species preyed upon more zooplankton because of the abundant food resource. Daily rations of silver and bighead carp were estimated by Egger's model in the main growing season. Filtration rate was calculated from the daily ration and the density of plankton in the lake. During May-October, filtration rates of silver and bighead carp for phytoplankton were 0.22-1.53 L g(-1) h(-1) and 0.02-0.68 L g(-1) h(-1), respectively, and filtration rates for zooplankton were 0.24-0.44 L g(-1) h(-1) and 0.08-1.41 L g(-1) h(-1), respectively. Silver carp had a stronger ability of eliminating phytoplankton than bighead carp. To achieve a successful bioniampulation with a minimum effect of ichthyoeutrophication, the stocking proportion of bighead carp should be controlled in the future practice.

Effects of short-term experimental manipulation of captive social environment on uropygial gland microbiome and preen oil volatile composition	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												IntroductionAvian preen oil, secreted by the uropygial gland, is an important source of volatile compounds that convey information about the sender's identity and quality, making preen oil useful for the recognition and assessment of potential mates and rivals. Although intrinsic factors such as hormone levels, genetic background, and diet can affect preen oil volatile compound composition, many of these compounds are not the products of the animal's own metabolic processes, but rather those of odor-producing symbiotic microbes. Social behavior affects the composition of uropygial microbial communities, as physical contact results in microbe sharing. We experimentally manipulated social interactions in captive dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) to assess the relative influence of social interactions, subspecies, and sex on uropygial gland microbial composition and the resulting preen oil odor profiles. MethodsWe captured 24 birds at Mountain Lake Biological Station in Virginia, USA, including birds from two seasonally sympatric subspecies - one resident, one migratory. We housed them in an outdoor aviary in three phases of social configurations: first in same-sex, same-subspecies flocks, then in male-female pairs, and finally in the original flocks. Using samples taken every four days of the experiment, we characterized their uropygial gland microbiome through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and their preen oil volatile compounds via GC-MS. ResultsWe predicted that if social environment was the primary driver of uropygial gland microbiome composition, and if microbiome composition in turn affected preen oil volatile profiles, then birds housed together would become more similar over time. Our results did not support this hypothesis, instead showing that sex and subspecies were stronger predictors of microbiome composition. We observed changes in volatile compounds after the birds had been housed in pairs, which disappeared after they were moved back into flocks, suggesting that hormonal changes related to breeding condition were the most important factor in these patterns. DiscussionAlthough early life social environment of nestlings and long-term social relationships have been shown to be important in shaping uropygial gland microbial communities, our study suggests that shorter-term changes in social environment do not have a strong effect on uropygial microbiomes and the resulting preen oil volatile compounds.					; Van Laar, Tricia A./H-8177-2019; Hagey, Travis/H-5140-2019; Whittaker, Danielle/I-7294-2013; Van Laar, Tricia/H-8177-2019; Soini, Helena/ABC-2420-2020	Slade, Joel/0000-0002-4587-5033; Van Laar, Tricia A./0000-0002-4654-8501; Whittaker, Danielle/0000-0002-3491-5642; Hagey, Travis/0000-0002-3960-6814; 													2296-701X					JAN 6	2023	10								1027399	10.3389/fevo.2022.1027399	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.1027399													WOS:000916160400001
J	Li, Y; Liu, L; Cui, SZ; Chen, FZ				Li, Yun; Liu, Le; Cui, Suzhen; Chen, Feizhou			Long-term effects of nutrient changes on rotifer communities in a subtropical lake	LIMNOLOGY												External nutrient loading has a major influence on the abundance, composition and diversity of zooplankton communities. To clarify how the reduction of nutrient loading during lake restoration interacts with other abiotic and biotic factors and how the interactive factors affect long-term changes in rotifer communities, we analyzed the relationships between the rotifer communities and environmental factors using a 17-year dataset. After the reduction of nutrients, both the abundance and biomass of rotifers declined, and the dominant rotifers changed from eutrophic-tolerant species to less tolerant ones. The lower TN:TP ratio that was caused by the imbalanced decrease in TN and TP after restoration promoted cyanobacteria, which negatively related to the resource-use efficiency of rotifers. Moreover, seasonal differences in the Shannon-Wiener index-TN relationships and the decrease in the Pielou index with the increase in water temperature implied there were interactive effects of water temperature and nutrients on species diversity. The study concluded that changes in rotifer abundance and community composition were mainly related to TN, but the changes in species diversity were mainly related to the interactive effects of the TN:TP ratio, water temperature and food quality. Our findings highlighted the effects caused by imbalanced nutrient changes on species diversity.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2019	20	2					191	201		10.1007/s10201-018-0567-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0567-x													WOS:000462932600007

Behavior of 3-Isobutyl-2-hydroxypyrazine (IBHP), a Key Intermediate in 3-Isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) Metabolism, in Ripening Wine Grapes	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY												3-Isobutyl-2-hydroxypyrazine (IBHP) is thought to be a key intermediate in both the biosynthesis and degradation of the herbaceous smelling 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP), but its behavior during the growing season is not well understood. First, an improved method for IBHP quantification was developed. A deuterated IBHP standard was added to samples prior to isolation by mixed-mode cation exchange solid phase extraction. Extracts were silylated prior to quantification by GC-MS. A limit of detection of ca. 20 ng/L could be achieved for a 100 mL juice sample. This method was used to quantify IBHP during the 2010 growing season in berries of two clones of Cabernet franc in the Finger Lakes region of New York and of Merlot grown in the California Central Valley. For all three sources, IBHP was detectable at the earliest sampling point, and its concentration per berry increased to a maximum around veraison, 208-477 pg/berry. On a per berry basis, IBHP peaked and began to decline 1-2 weelcs after IBMP, indicating that previous studies that sampled preveraison fruit have missed the true maximum value of IBHP. The highest per berry concentration of IBHP observed was in the California Merlot. However, after veraison, IBHP declined more rapidly in the California Merlot than in the New York Cabernet franc, such that the Merlot had the lowest IBHP concentration at harvest. Thus, IBHP at harvest cannot be used as a proxy for IBMP at veraison as was previously suggested.

J	Bruch, RM; Binkowski, FP				Bruch, RM; Binkowski, FP			Spawning behavior of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					4th International Symposium on Sturgeon	JUL 08-13, 2001	OSHKOSH, WI					The spawning behavior of lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, was observed and characterized over a 16-year period on the Wolf and upper Fox rivers of the Winnebago system in East Central Wisconsin. Lake sturgeon display an intricate set of sexual behavior responses to water temperature during their spawning period. When water temperatures rise to 6.6-16.0 degreesC sturgeon begin exhibiting a porpoising behavior in the vicinity of the spawning grounds. As the water continues to warm, this behavior increases in intensity and continues until slightly past the peak of spawning activity. In the range of 8.8-16.0 degreesC males move onto the spawning grounds and begin cruising, apparently searching for signs of ovulating females. Individual females will move onto a site at water temperatures of 8.8-19.1 degreesC with the maximum number of females and heaviest spawning activity on a site occurring generally within 11.5-16.0 degreesC. Lake sturgeon were observed spawning both during the day and night at wide temperature ranges, 8.8-21.1 degreesC. Whereas males arrive first at the spawning site, females ultimately determine the duration of spawning through the timing and intensity of their use of that site. During the spawning act, activity also keys of the females, with the males responding to cues from the female to participate in 2-4 s spawning bouts during which a relatively small number of eggs (estimated 947-1444 eggs per bout) are released by the female into a cloud of sperm ( estimated 200 800 billion sperm) from two to eight males. The males beat the abdomen of the female with their tails and caudal peduncles while ejaculating. While ejaculating, males emit a dull, thunderous vibrating sound which attracts other males to the area. The female initiates a spawning bout at approximately 1.5 min intervals and will continue oviposition for 8 -12 h, even if the water temperature decreases or increases outside the optimal range (11.5-16.0 degreesC). Spawning typically occurs for 2 4 days on each site, depending on the number of females utilizing the site. At cessation of the spawning season, Wolf River sturgeon quickly move back into the main river channel. While water temperature is a key environmental signal affecting the onset and duration of the spawning period, the rate of water temperature increase prior to spawning appears to influence the actual temperature at which spawning begins. Sturgeon exhibit complex polygamous mating behavior whereby several males may fertilize the eggs of a single female, and each male may participate in spawning with several females while on the spawning grounds. The breeding system is both polyandrous and polygynous, thereby maximizing the opportunities for mating with numerous individuals and subsequently maximizing the genetic diversity of the offspring.																			0175-8659					DEC	2002	18	4-6					570	579		10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00421.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00421.x													WOS:000179913400054

Importance of internal dissolved organic nitrogen loading and cycling in a small and heavily modified coastal lagoon	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Estuaries are productive ecosystems that provide important ecosystem functions such as the storage and cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nutrients. Intermittently closed/open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) can significantly impact biogeochemical processing and release of terrestrial nitrogen and carbon into the coastal environment due to longer residence times that can extend nutrient processing within the ICOLL. Pulses of nutrient release then occur when there is connectivity between the catchment and coastal waters. It remains unclear how modifications to estuaries and their catchments impact internal processes. To better understand the balance between autochthonous and allochthonous nutrients in a heavily modified ICOLL, multiple stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) of dissolved nutrients were used to evaluate seasonal and spatial changes to nitrogen sources and sinks in a southwest Australian ICOLL. The eutrophic status of water bodies has traditionally been based on concentrations of inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (particularly NH4+ and NOx) due to its presumed higher bioavailability and association with anthropogenic pollution. However, both NH4+ and NOx concentrations were low (0 - 12.5 mu M) throughout the study area in both wet and dry seasons. Despite low surface water DIN concentrations, the system suffers from eutrophication issues such as algal blooms, low dissolved oxygen, and fish kills. The differences between the surface and porewater dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and carbon (DOC) pools decreased in the wet season (high connectivity), suggesting that internal DOM turnover sustains eutrophication. This work demonstrates that including DON and its isotopic signature can be an effective way to study N in waterbodies with low DIN concentrations. It also highlights the need for DON, as a major constituent of total dissolved nitrogen, to be included in N studies and ultimately may have significant impact on the current understanding of the global N budget.

An appraisal of carbon capture and sequestration in few selected wetlands of West Bengal	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Wetlands provide numerous ecological and economic services to mankind. The soils of wetlands are one of the largest sinks of carbon (C) among the terrestrial ecosystems and can play an important role in offsetting the emission of C as a greenhouse gas (GHG) to the atmosphere. India is bestowed with enriched wetland ecosystems that support diverse and unique habitats. The potential of the wetlands in terms of C capture and sequestration has not been quantified. Therefore, in the present paper, an assessment of C capture from different sources and its ultimate deposition in soils leading to sequestration has been done in three different types of wetlands, one created sewage-fed and two natural floodplain oxbow lakes, in the West Bengal state of India. Multiple seasonal sampling of water, macrophytes, and soil was done to assess the primary productivity, dissolved C, and deposition of C in soils of the wetlands in comparison to reference upland sites. All these wetlands are productive ecosystems as indicated by the physicochemical parameters of water and soil. The quantity of C accumulated up to 0.3 m depth in the oxbow lakes was to the tune of 144-166 Mg/ha, which was 3.43-4.78 times higher than that in the corresponding reference upland sites. In the sewage-fed wetland, the C accumulation estimated as 50 Mg/ha was 1.27 times higher than its corresponding upland site. So, the wetland ecosystems, particularly the floodplains, are highly efficient in accumulating C in their soils and thus can somewhat negate the GHG emission.					; SARKAR, UTTAM/K-3247-2019	Nag, Subir/0000-0003-3929-503X; 													1387-585X	1573-2975				FEB	2024	26	2					4229	4244		10.1007/s10668-022-02881-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-022-02881-8		JAN 2023											WOS:000907071200002

Fire disturbance and forest structure in old-growth mixed conifer forests in the northern Sierra Nevada, California	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: This study evaluates how fire regimes influence stand structure and dynamics in old-growth mixed conifer forests across a range of environmental settings. Location: A 2000-ha area of mixed conifer forest on the west shore of Lake Tahoe in the northern Sierra Nevada, California. Methods: We quantified the age, size, and spatial structure of trees in 12 mixed conifer stands distributed across major topographic gradients. Fire history was reconstructed in each stand using fire scar dendrochronology. The influence of fire on stand structure was assessed by comparing the fire history with the age, size, and spatial structure of trees in a stand. Results: There was significant variation in species composition among stands, but not in the size, age and spatial patterning of trees. Stands had multiple size and age classes with clusters of similar aged trees occurring at scales of 113-254 m(2). The frequency and severity of fires was also similar, and stands burned with low to moderate severity in the dormant season on average every 9 - 17 years. Most fires were not synchronized among stands except in very dry years. No fires have burned since ca. 1880. Conclusions: Fire and forest structure interact to perpetuate similar stand characteristics across a range of environmental settings. Fire occurrence is controlled primarily by spatial variation in fuel mosaics (e.g. patterns of abundance, fuel moisture, forest structure), but regional drought synchronizes fire in some years. Fire exclusion over the last 120 years has caused compositional and structural shifts in these mixed conifer forests.

Long-term periodic structure and seasonal-trend decomposition of water level in Lake Baiyangdian, Northern China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water level, as an intuitive factor of hydrologic conditions, is of great importance for lake management. In this study, periodic structures of water level and its fluctuations in Lake Baiyangdian are analyzed based on wavelet analysis and seasonal-trend decomposition using local error sum of squares (STL). Data of monthly time series are divided into three types with emphasis on anthropogenic influence from water allocation. It is found that intra-annual characteristics of water level fluctuations are the common periodic structures. Water allocation alters the periodic structures by decreasing and weakening the oscillations of water level, compared with the slight effects of natural hydrologic water supplies and short-term climate changes. An irregular water level decline and short-term oscillation with irregular periodicity are deduced from seasonal-trend decomposition analysis using STL. With seasonality depicted monthly, the influence of water allocation implies irregular oscillations with high-frequency components, especially for monthly changes. The water level fluctuations are influenced by seasonal changes, as demonstrated by three types of time series. The impacts of water allocation on seasonality show the differences with continuous single-peak oscillations representing no influences and continuous double-peak oscillations representing frequent influences. Furthermore, the accumulation of water allocation shows a slight rising trend in average monthly level fluctuations over the last several years. The study helps understand periodic structures and long-term trend changes of water level fluctuations, which will facilitate lake management of Lake Baiyangdian.					wang, xuan/JBJ-6948-2023														1735-1472	1735-2630				MAR	2014	11	2					327	338		10.1007/s13762-013-0362-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-013-0362-5													WOS:000331804300009

Periphyton, dominated by algae and cyanobacteria, is frequently a key component of newly established aquatic ecosystems. Periphyton and its response to abiotic factors were studied in the littoral zone of three post-mining lakes with different ages of foundation situated in the Czech Republic. The microbial diversity of phototrophs as a major component of periphyton is largely unknown in such localities. The studied habitat proved to harbour a huge periphytic diversity-25% of diatom species found in the respective watershed (similar to 5500 km(2)) inhabited exlusively the studied lakes. Species composition of phototrophic microorganisms varied significantly (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) among the studied lakes, seasons, and sampling years. However, the sampling depths and sampling site of the studied lake have not shown a significant impact on the diversity, indicating the homogeneous composition of the littoral periphyton within a particular lake and growing season. The seasonal dynamics of periphyton were unique for each lake, documenting three distinct successional patterns. The proportion of diatoms in the periphytic community decreases with the higher trophic state and flooding age of the post-mining lakes. Cyanobacteria and mobile diatom forms prevailed later in the growing season, suggesting that they could utilise nutrients released from the accumulated periphyton biomass. Calcium ions were one of the best correlates of species data among other abiotic variables tested, offering the intriguing question of the role of calcium in the formation of periphytic mats for future research.

However, these reservoirs are subject to variables that impact the volume and quality of the stored water, with the contribution of such nutrients as Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) being one of the main factors in intensifying the eutrophication process. The aim of this study was to quantify the principal inputs and outputs of nutrients (N and P) and calculate the nutrient balance, in order to verify the influence of seasonality on the import and export of these nutrients in surface reservoirs of the semi-arid region of Brazil. Seven campaigns were carried out between 2015 and 2016, with water samples collected at five points in the Pereira de Miranda reservoir and four in the General Sampaio reservoir. The inflow of nutrients was greater when the inflow rate of the water was higher. The balance showed the accumulation of 22.8 tons of TN and 2.8 tons of TP in the Pereira de Miranda reservoir, and 13 tons of TN and 1.5 tons of TP in the General Sampaio. These reservoirs are therefore retaining nutrients, acting as a storage site for nutrients transported by surface runoff in the basin of the Curu River. This increase in storage occurred mainly during the rainy season, when nutrient retention by the reservoirs impaired water quality, resulting in eutrophication, and making it diffi cult to meet the uses for which the reservoirs were intended.					; Becker, Helena/AAZ-3269-2020; Lopes, Fernando/AAS-1586-2021; Andrade, Eunice/N-1464-2019; ANDRADE, EUNICE/N-1464-2019	Bezerra Lopes, Fernando/0000-0001-8285-2925; Andrade, Eunice/0000-0002-9750-0364; 													0045-6888	1806-6690					2023	54								e20228421	10.5935/1806-6690.20230057	http://dx.doi.org/10.5935/1806-6690.20230057													WOS:001052160500001

Combining Artificial Neural Network and Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response Approach for Evaluating a Mediterranean Lake	WATER												The main objective of this research was to evaluate the surface water system of Lake Vegoritida (Region of Central Macedonia, Greece). The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) methodological approach was used. The analysis includes data from three (3) stations monitoring point source pollution and recording the most critical water quality measurement parameters in a time series data analysis from 1983 to 1997. The data will contribute to the analysis and was used to investigate, identify, and evaluate possible sources of chemical and ecological changes recorded in the lake. The artificial neural network (ANN) is a valuable tool for making predictions based on the water quality data set. The findings highlighted the increased concentration of nutrients that contribute to the presence of eutrophic conditions, while their seasonal variability is mainly due to factors, such as water level fluctuations and biological processes in the lake. The above, combined with the critical biotic indicators and factors alongside the reduction in biodiversity, indicated that only the most resistant species survive, confirming the previous finding. In Greece, systematic monitoring and reporting programs have recently been implemented, such as the ECOFRAME scheme and the guidelines proposed by the "Intercalibration Group for Mediterranean Lakes". The water quality status could be classified as "High", "High to Good", and "High to Poor", respectively, while the overall ecological assessment tends to change to poor conditions. The actions required at an early stage concern the planning of programs and actions that contribute to the sustainable management of land uses and the reduction in point sources of pollution, as well as the reduction of the applied quantities of agrochemicals on the cultivated land in the study area.					; Alexakis, Dimitrios/I-1114-2016; Alexakis, Dimitriοs/I-1114-2016; MOUSTRIS, KONSTANTINOS/AAA-3136-2021	MOUSTRIS, KONSTANTINOS/0000-0002-7717-9649; Alexakis, Dimitrios/0000-0002-4495-5330; Tsitsis, Christos/0000-0002-9158-3541														2073-4441				JAN	2023	15	2							266	10.3390/w15020266	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15020266													WOS:000918831400001

However, compared to large lakes, ponds are difficult to identify by satellite, and they have not been adequately studied. Here, we observed methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in the growing season at three sites along the water table gradient from the pelagic zone, littoral zone and bog across a shallow pond in a boreal peatland landscape in Northeastern China. The results showed that the littoral zone, dominated by herb Carex, was the hotspot for CH4 emissions. CH4 fluxes in littoral zone averaged 78.98 +/- 19.00 mg m(-2) h(-1). The adjacent bog was a weak source of CH4 emissions, with an average flux of 0.07 +/- 0.05 mg m(-2) h(-1). Within the pond, CH4 was mainly emitted through ebullition, accounting for 88.56% of the total CH4 fluxes, and the ebullition fluxes were negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). CO2 fluxes were highest in the pelagic zone, with an average of 419.76 +/- 47.25 mg m(-2) h(-1). Wind and strong sediment respiration were key factors that led to the high fluxes. The observed three sites were all atmospheric N2O sinks ranging from -0.92 to -10.90 mu g m(-2) h(-1). This study highlights the spatial variation in greenhouse gas fluxes from the pond and its adjacent bog, ignoring the ecotone area may underestimate CH4 fluxes. Although ponds are a hotspot for CH4 and CO2 emissions, they can also be a sink for N2O, which provides a reference for the quantification of global pond GHG fluxes. Therefore, finer-scale in situ observations are necessary to better understand the feedback of permafrost peatland ponds to global warming.

A field experiment was conducted, using irrigation of RW plus urea fertilization under equal nitrogen (N) rate, namely, black water (BW), domestic wastewater (DW), gray water (GW), SW, and SW without any N application as a control (CK), to elucidate N removal by the paddy wetland system during the rice growing season of 2007. Materials and methods SW, GW, DW, and BW were collected from the village of Liangzhu in subtropical China. Water samples were stored in darkness at 4 degrees C in an icebox prior to analysis. Total nitrogen (TN) was analyzed by the spectrophotometric method with a continuous-flow automated analyzer. For the soil analyses, pH was measured using a pH meter with soil/distilled water - 1: 5; cation exchange capacity was determined with an unbuffered salt extraction method. Redox potential (Eh) was obtained using a pH meter with a platinum electrode, whereas organic carbon (C) was determined using the Walkley and Black method. TN was calculated by acid-alkali neutralization, after the soil samples were digested with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), distilled and then absorbed by diluted boric acid (H3BO3), and available N was determined by alkaline-proliferation law, after the samples were hydrolyzed, reduced, and absorbed by H3BO3. Available P was determined with the colorimetric method at the wave length of 660 nm, after the samples were extracted with NaHCO3, and available K was extracted by unbuffered NH4Cl and then determined by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The rice plant samples were digested with H2SO4-H2O2, and N contents were analyzed by the atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results Yield for the CK was significantly less (P <= 0.05) than those of SW, GW, DW, and BW, with the yield of BW significantly greater (P <= 0.05) than all the other treatments. The TN concentration of the floodwater in the paddy wetland system decreased rapidly after transplanting, rose significantly (P <= 0.05) after two N topdressings, and then decreased gradually as the following sequences: SW>GW>DW>BW>CK, but tended to be stable until 15 October. Meanwhile, TN removal rates from the wastewater were significantly higher (P <= 0.05) than those from the urea fertilizer. Total N load (TNL) increased significantly after two topdressings and reached the maximum value just after the first topdressing on 22 July: SW, 21.0 kg ha(-1); GW, 19.1 kg ha(-1); BW, 15.3 kg ha(-1); DW, 14.3 kg ha(-1); and CK, 0.57 kg ha(-1). Subsequently, TNL declined gradually and reached stability on 15 October. Just after the rice seedlings were transplanted, the soil released a large amount of inorganic N (26.3%-40.4%); however, after the topdressing, the soil adsorbed a lot of N and TNL originating from the RW, which had decreased, ranging from 34.5% to 47.8%. Discussion A reasonable N rate would be necessary for normal rice production in the Tai Lake region, which is different from those studies of other systems. Irrigation with RW for the paddy field could not only reduce the amount of commercial N fertilizer usage and irrigation water but also increase rice grain yield. Meanwhile, N use efficiency was improved by the combination of both N fertilizer and RW. The more N fertilizer was used, the higher the TN concentration in the flooded water would be, and the more potential risk of N to the surface water body. However, the N in RW could be removed more easily than that of the fertilizer by the paddy wetland system, which may be related to the existing form and concentration of N in the RW and urea fertilizer. The TNL in the floodwater had a positive correlation with the urea application rate, implying that appreciable amounts of N input might be lost, either by a heavy rainfall event or floodwater drainage using improper water management methods closely subsequent to the urea application. This revealed that using GW, DW, or BW instead of SW as irrigation water could decrease the loss of N applied and reduce the environmental pollution risk for the surface water. Conclusions Supplemental N was necessary in this area for normal rice production, and the rice grain yield of CK (without any N fertilizer applied) was significantly lower than the other treatments; however, the yield of SW (with N fertilizer applied) was not significantly different from those of GW and DW. However, irrigation with RW in the paddy rice field could reduce costs of fertilizer and irrigation water. In addition, using BW would significantly increase rice yield revenues. The paddy wetland system also removed large quantities of N due to the irrigation with RW and applied N fertilizer, with the TN removal rates for RW significantly higher than that for the N fertilizer. Thus, application of RW instead of N fertilizer alone could greatly decrease the discharge of N into water bodies; thus, paddy wetland system can be considered as a new method for the RW treatment, especially in the Tai Lake region of China. Recommendations and perspectives Based on this study, it would be strongly recommended to use RW irrigation after had been disinfected for reducing part of commercial N fertilizer rate and saving some irrigation water in rice production with the paddy wetland system as a cost-effective way to remove the N from the RW and mitigate the non-point pollution.. Future work should pay attention to the largest removal capacity of the paddy wetland system per unit and effect on the rice grain quality irrigated with the RW.

The objective of the study was to evaluate changes of ice indices (duration, thickness and breakup dates) of this lagoon and to assess their possible tendencies in the 21st century. A methodology was developed combining the assessment of past changes (1960-2017) of ice indices and their projections in the near (2021-2040) and far (2081-2100) future periods using a hydrometeorological database, statistical methods and regression analysis as well as regional climate models and RCP scenarios. Climate change has a considerable impact on ice conditions in the Curonian Lagoon. During the historical period of 1960-2017, the Curonian Lagoon was covered with ice for 72 days a year, ice thickness reached 23 cm, whereas ice breakup was observed in the middle of March on average. According to the different scenarios, in the near and far future periods, ice duration will last 35-45 and 3-34 days, respectively. Ice thickness is projected to be 13-15 cm in the near future, whereas, at the end of the century, it is expected to decline to 0-13 cm. In the past, the lagoon ice cover remained until the middle of the third decade of February. At the end of the 21st century, RCP8.5 scenario projects the most drastic shifts: the permanent ice cover might be absent, whereas short-term ice cover is expected to melt already in the beginning of January.

Shallow groundwater chemical evolution, isotopic hyperfiltration, and salt pan formation in a hypersaline endorheic basin: Pilot Valley, Great Basin, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Endorheic basin brines are of economic significance as sources of boron, iodine, magnesium, potassium, sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate, and tungsten, and they are a major source of the critical metal lithium. Although evaporation is the primary hypersalinization driver for evaporative water bodies, recent investigations have proposed more novel mechanisms for some subsurface brine. This investigation explores shallow groundwater hypersalinization. The chemical evolution and isotopic fractionation of shallow hypersaline groundwater in the clay-rich arid endorheic basin sediments of Pilot Valley, Great Basin (USA), were investigated. Groundwater evolves from fresh in the mountain bedrock and alluvial fans, to brackish and saline at the alluvial fan-playa interface, and to hypersaline in the upper 12 m of basin sediments. Alluvial fan systems are isolated from each other and have varying groundwater H-3 and C-14 travel times. Nonevaporative in-situ isotopic fractionation of up to -8 parts per thousand in delta O-18 is attributed to clay sequence hyperfiltration. Groundwater flow-path sulfate and chloride mineral dissolution is the primary driving mechanism for both interface and basin groundwater evolution. Evaporation only impacts the groundwater quality in a small portion of the basin where the groundwater is within similar to 1 m of the ground surface. Here capillary action carries dissolved soluble salts to the land surface. Episodic flooding redissolves and carries the precipitated salt to the annually flooded salt pan where it accumulates as a salt crust during the dry season. The Pilot Valley model may help explain the buildup accumulative layers of soluble salt that when remobilized becomes subsurface brine.						, Alan/0000-0002-8091-9337													1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2021	29	6					2219	2243		10.1007/s10040-021-02371-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-021-02371-7		JUN 2021											WOS:000664013800001

Water and sediment samples were taken seasonally from six sites exposed to different anthropogenic impacts. The most enriched elements in the Dam Lake were As, Cd, Mo, and Pb. In all sampling sites, the average heavy metal concentrations indicated low risk except for Cd and Pb which were classified in the moderate ecological risk class. Overall, the ecological risk was low for one site (S3) because of the far distance from the residential areas, while the ecological risk of the other stations was moderate. According to water analysis results, the aquatic life criteria could not be met for Zn, Cu, Cr, and Hg in Sureyyabey Dam Lake. Although the dam lake is used only for irrigation purposes, the Sureyyabey Dam Lake water is not suitable for drinking according to the metal limit values of the World Health Organisation. The results of the current study will contribute to the awareness of local authorities by using several indices on taking the necessary precautions.

Impact of abiotic factors on microbialite growth (Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA): a tank experiment	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Microbialites are microbial communities that create a carbonate structure. They are abundant in the Great Salt Lake, a hypersaline lake in the arid Great Basin of the USA, where they contribute to overall primary production, seasonally up to 55%. While the microbial diversity of microbialites has been investigated, how abiotic factors affect the abundance of their primary constituents is not well understood. We examined how microbialite primary producers respond to varying levels of temperature, salinity, and nitrogen within ranges observed in the Great Salt Lake. All abiotic factors and their interactions significantly affected the maximum chlorophyll-a abundance, suggesting that these factors co-limit microbialite primary producers in the Great Salt Lake. Maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations increased with nitrogen additions and showed a parabolic relationship with salinity and temperature with peaks around 60 ppt and 20 degrees C, respectively. While salinity had a strong effect on microbialite primary producers, we found that temperature and nitrogen were more impactful, accounting for 40 and 30% of the variance in maximum abundance, respectively, while salinity contributed just 15%. Our results show the importance of the interplay of abiotic factors on Great Salt Lake microbialites and highlight the need for increased study of benthic communities in inland saline lakes.					; Anderson, Nick/R-2337-2019; Jones, Shannon/GXV-9288-2022; Belovsky, Gary/C-1255-2014	Barrett, Katherine/0000-0002-5981-133X; Anderson, Nicholas/0000-0002-4043-6162; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2020	847	9					2113	2122		10.1007/s10750-020-04235-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04235-9		MAR 2020											WOS:000522862300001

Distributed conceptual modelling and different field data were used in the modelling process. Three different model representations with varying model complexity were employed to test the appropriate model structure. Parameters were conditioned within the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) framework using both discharge and environmental isotope information indicating the ratio of new and old water during the wet season. It was demonstrated that the two catchments cannot be modelled equally well with the same model structure due to differences in the rainfall-runoff processes caused by different amounts of wetlands leading to different hydrological responses. Hence, a single model structure for the entire Abay/Upper Blue Nile cannot do justice to all the dominant hydrological processes in the various sub-catchments in the basin.

However, the impact of GW-SW interaction on lake development and evolution remains indistinct. In this study, 101 water samples were collected from groundwater and lake water in a floodplain lake region from 2022 to 2023. Statistical analysis, hydrogeochemical analysis, stable isotope mass-balance modeling, in-situ hydraulic tests, lake water budget and remote sensing method were employed to investigate the groundwater-lake water interaction and lake development in Poyang Lake area. Results showed that the hydraulic connectivity in the southern and northern part of the lake was relatively high while was relatively low in the middle part. The hydraulic conductivity varied from 0.0016 m/d to 1.8557 m/d and the transform intensity between GW and SW ranged from 1.28 x 10-6 m/d to 1.71 x 10-2 m/d across the sampling points. GW-SW interaction patterns exhibited spatial and temporal variabilities. Geology and geomorphology affected the GW-SW hydraulic connectivity. Hydrology, meteorology and anthropogenic activities affected the GW-SW transform relationship. The evaporation and inflow ratios (E/I) of the lake changed from 0.0016 to 0.6747 calculated by 518O and from 0.0002 to 0.0197 by 52H over the study period. E/I had negative correlation with GW-SW transform intensity. Lake area depended on groundwater recharge in the dry season while this effect was small in the wet season. The results will provide crucial references of understanding regional hydrological cycle, water body evolution and their response to the changing environment to international large fresh water lake areas.					; Wang, Xihua/GQG-9119-2022; Xu, Y./A-7681-2014	Wang, Xihua/0000-0002-4795-304X; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2025	650								132557	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132557		DEC 2024											WOS:001392508600001

A total of 15 TEs were analysed and the results revealed that Arsenic (As), Chromium (Cr), and Nickel (Ni) were primarily controlled by lithogenic sources, whereas, Cadmium (Cd), Cobalt (Co), Cesium (Cs), Cupper (Cu), Manganese (Mn), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) were derived from both anthropic and geogenic sources. Additionally, the concentration of Zn was markedly high, especially during the post-monsoon season nearby the landfill site, indicating the anthropic signatures. The hazard index and cancer index were found to be < 1.00 and 10(-6)-10(-4), respectively indicating minimum health impacts.

Climate change is one of the key drivers of changes in the biodiversity of the planet. There is, however, a general lack of long-term data sets showing trends in taxonomic diversity of aquatic insects in high mountain environments particularly vulnerable to climate change. Using palaeolimnological techniques, we explored the changes in subfossil chironomid assemblages from three remote water bodies in the Eastern Alps, with the main focus on taxonomic turnover over different intervals of the late Holocene. Major changes in the assemblages coincided with shifts between different climate regimes and were mainly associated with the taxonomic shifts indicating the crossing ecological thresholds related to the ice-cover duration in alpine lakes. Patterns of assemblage turnover through the past 2000years differ between the study sites. Nevertheless, despite site-specific differences in the physical setting and taxonomic composition, the study sites reveal substantial chironomid assemblage turnover (>1.0 SD) since AD 1850. The highest chironomid turnover (0.87 SD) over the last 30years (AD 1980-2010), more than three times greater (0.26 SD) than in the previous 30years, is observed in the lake situated at the highest elevation among the study lakes. Applying non-linear structural equation modelling, we found that cold-season (October-May) temperatures and therefore lake ice phenology are among the most important environment variables affecting the chironomid assemblages. The results of this study suggest that further climate warming will increase the risk of ecological alterations in remote Alpine freshwaters, including major shifts in chironomid fauna.					; Tylmann, Wojciech/AAL-3504-2021; Ilyashuk, Elena/A-1910-2017; Ilyashuk, Boris/AAZ-7301-2020; Koinig, Karin/F-2542-2013	Ilyashuk, Boris/0000-0003-3846-7178; Tylmann, Wojciech/0000-0003-1749-5882; Ilyashuk, Elena/0000-0001-7335-4123; Koinig, Karin/0000-0002-3659-4934													1752-458X	1752-4598				NOV	2015	8	6					547	561		10.1111/icad.12137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.12137													WOS:000363862300006

We also tested the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) as disinfection by-products (DBPs) via chlorination of the water samples from these reservoirs. This study showed that these reservoirs were mesotrophic with the average chlorophyll a (Chl a) levels ranging from 2.31 to 7.79 mu g l(-1). The average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the six reservoirs was 2.70 mg l(-1), and the degree of aromaticity of NOM indicated by UV254 (absorbance at 254 nm) was 0.048 cm(-1). Total phosphorous (TP) was significantly correlated with chlorophyll a, as well as DOC and UV254. It suggested that the major component of NOM, with a specific UV254 value (SUV254) of 1.78 l mg(-1) m(-1), was algal-derived organic matter. Existing models from other studies could be used to predict THM yield from NOM level in the present study, but the relationship between HAAs and NOM suggested that aromatic portion of the NOM in the investigated reservoirs had a greater potential to produce HAAs.

Spatial and temporal variability in epilithic biofilm bacterial communities along an upland river gradient	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Riverine biofilms remain one of the least-studied habitats despite the significant increase in the examination of aquatic microbial communities in recent years. In this study, the dynamics of epilithic biofilm communities native on rocks from a low-order upland stream were examined over a period of 3 years. Spatial and temporal variations in bacterial communities were assessed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, based on analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. In total, 108 epilithic biofilm samples were analysed and 170 different ribotypes were detected. A strong temporal gradient in ribotype composition was noticed, especially between samples collected in 2001 and those collected in 2002 and 2003, most likely reflecting interannual differences in weather conditions, such as temperature. A spatial gradient in ribotype composition, from upstream sites to the low-lying sites, was also evident and interpreted as an environmental variation gradient along the river course. Distinct biofilm communities consistently occurred at the first site along the river, which was significantly correlated to low pH. Temporal factors explained the highest degree of variation within the epilithic biofilms. Recurrent blooms of certain bacteria were noted within the system. Phylogenetic relationships of bacteria at one point in the river were determined using a cloning and sequencing approach, with Alphaproteobacteria dominating the community, followed by Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria.

J	Lan, B; Zhang, DL; Yang, YP				Lan, Bo; Zhang, Dongliang; Yang, Yunpeng			Evolution of Lake Ailike (northern Xinjiang of China) during past 130 years inferred from diatom data	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Sino-German Symposium on Lake-Catchment Interactions and their Responses to Hydrological Extremes	OCT, 2015	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA					We have studied diatom assemblages of a 42-cm-long sediment core obtained from Lake Ailike in northern Xinjiang of China to reconstruct the hydrological and ecological variations of the past 130 years. Three environmental parameters of lake water (i.e., diatom-inferred pH, diatom-inferred total phosphorus and diatom-inferred conductivity) were estimated by comparing the fossil diatom assemblages from the Lake Ailike core with the modern diatom assemblages in the European Diatom Database. The reconstruction exhibited two major stages: stage A (1884-1960) was a "natural" stage and stage B (1960 -2013) was a "human" stage. The "natural" stage can be further divided into two sub-stages: A-1 (1884-1920) was characterized by an averagely low lake area and A-2 (1920-1960) was a stably high lake-area period. The comparison between the reconstructed lake-area variations from Lake Ailike with the treering-recorded Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) variations from nearby Hutubi shows that the low lake area from 1884 to 1920 was correspondent with a dry period and that the high lake area from 1920 to 1960 with a wet period. The similarity between PDSI from Hutubi and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) implies a climatic linkage. The linkage is revealed by the tight in-phase relationship between AMO and SWP (Siberian warm-season precipitation), that is, the AMO-promoted SWP might have extended its influence to northern Xinjiang. The "human" stage can also be divided into two substages: B-1 (1960-2000) was a regressing stage and B-2 (2000-2013) was a transgressing stage. The man-made regression led to dramatic increases in TP of the lake water, TOC and TN of the sediments and also in the resulted decrease in lake water pH.

Fatty acids were correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface temperature. Lipid content, total polyunsaturated, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids of the samples from the south-west coast showed positive correlation with chlorophyll-a concentration during the monsoon (r(2) = 0.93, 0.97, 0.97 and 0.99, respectively). Higher hypocholesterolaemic/hypercholesterolaemic ratio (>1.0) and low atherogenic (<1.2), thrombogenicity (<= 0.6) indices make the groupers collected from the coast of the Arabian Sea a valued candidate species for human nutrition. High levels of n-3 fatty acids (>19% during post-monsoon), important in the human diet for their platelet anti-aggregating and blood pressure-reducing properties, for groupers collected from the south-west coast, with higher n-3/n-6 fatty acid ratio (>5.1) proved this species from the coast of the Arabian Sea to be a desirable item in the human diet.																			0025-3154	1469-7769				DEC	2014	94	8					1677	1686		10.1017/S0025315414000757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315414000757													WOS:000344548400009

However, there is considerable uncertainty in the development history of tropical wetlands in different geographical regions. In this study, the main objective was to synthesize the formation history of mangrove wetlands along the southwest coast of Sri Lanka in terms of past sea-level records in the region. Sedimentological observations were determined using representative sediment cores at Telwatta. Geochemical characteristics of sediment cores were determined using delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The chronology was obtained using accelerated mass spectrometry C-14 data for fossil coral samples. Black color fine to medium-grained core sediments can be identified as H-3/H-4 levels of decomposition based on the modified Von Post classification. This study identified that organic-rich sediment accumulation was initiated over the basal/inland coral deposits, any time after middle Holocene sea-level highstands. In this study, paleo sea-level indicator (i.e., basal coral in present-day land area) suggests that sea-level was about 1-2 m higher than present during ca. 5500 Cal year B.P. Heavy rainfall on the southwestern slopes also promotes the preservation of organic-rich sediments with seasonal flooding. The temporal variations of organic matter and carbonate contents suggest that there are no clear facies variations in this sedimentary succession. XRD analysis identified clay minerals such as montmorillonite and illite, and it indicates the deposition of sediments from a near distance or in situ source materials due to reinforced physical erosion. Stable isotopic values (delta C-13 = -27.18 parts per thousand to -26.46 parts per thousand and delta N-15 = 6.64 parts per thousand to 8.01 parts per thousand) reflect the mixing of freshwater sources (i.e., dissolved organic carbon and nitrate) to C-3 terrestrial plants dominant sediments. The humification index based on FTIR results (aromatic C=C and asymmetric COO- group vibrations to polysaccharides (1630/1053 cm(-1))) suggests a depleted level for decarboxylation below similar to 30 cm. The ratio of carboxyl C=O and aromatic ester group vibrations to polysaccharides (1720/1053 cm(-1)) also shows similar variations with the humification index. Looking forward, the 1720/1053 cm(-1) ratio can be proposed as a possible geochemical proxy for determining the degree of formation of humic acids in organic-rich sediments. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of Water Resources Utilization on the Hydrology of Mesopotamian Marshlands	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												The Mesopotamian Marshlands used to be the largest wetland ecosystem in the Middle East and western Eurasia. These marshlands once covered more than 15,000-20,000 sq km with permanent lakes and marshes, seasonal marshes, and temporary marshes. Although the recent restoration efforts returned the marshes back to approximately 39% of their original spatial extent, the artificial drainage works have significantly reduced the marshes during the late 1980s and 1990s. The water resources development/utilization in the upstream regions of the Tigris-Euphrates (TE) River Basin has been considered as one of the causes for the damage of the marshland ecosystem. To assess the hydrologic conditions in the Mesopotamian Marshes under various water utilization scenarios, a marshland hydrologic model for the Hawr Al Hammar Marshes near the downstream end of the TE River Network has been developed in conjunction with the regional hydro-climate model of Tigris-Euphrates (RegHCMTE) Watershed and the water resources system model of the Euphrates-Tigris River Basin. This marshland hydrologic model accounts for rainfall, evapotranspiration, surface water inflows and outflows, and soil water inflows and outflows. In this paper, the marshland hydrologic model for the Hawr Al Hammar Marshes is described, and the reconstruction of historical marshland hydrologic data over Hawr Al Hammar Marshes by using the coupled TE modeling system is presented. By using the developed Mesopotamia Marsh model, the impact of various water resources utilization alternatives in the TE Basin on the hydrology of the Hawr Al Hammar marshes is quantified. The simulation results reveal that by treating the TE Basin as one hydrologic unit, where water is transferred from the Tigris to the Euphrates River to meet the irrigation water demands in the basin for various release scenarios from the Turkish sector, it is possible to sustain the Al Hammar Marshes at their pre-dam-construction (pre-1970) conditions in the TE Basin under severe hydro-climate conditions of the historical critical dry period.

Water quality in two Australian dryland rivers: spatial and temporal variability and the role of flow	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Water quality, along with hydrology, plays an important role in the spatial and temporal dynamics of a range of ecological patterns and processes in large rivers and is also often a key component of river health assessments. Geology and land use are significant drivers of water quality during flow periods while during periods of no-flow, local-scale factors such as evaporation, groundwater influence and the concentration and precipitation of compounds are important. This study explored the water quality changes in two Australian dryland rivers, the Cooper Creek (Lake Eyre Basin) and the Warrego River (Murray-Darling Basin), across different hydrological phases over several years. Water quality varied both spatially and temporally; the greatest spatial variability occurred during the no-flow phase, with temporal changes driven by flow. Concentrations of major anions and cations also varied spatially and temporally, with an overall cation dominance of calcium and magnesium and an anion dominance of bicarbonate. This bicarbonate dominance contrasts with previous data from inland lentic systems where sodium chloride was found to dominate. Such extreme spatial and temporal variability hampers successful derivation of water quality guidelines for these variable rivers and suggests such guidelines would need to be developed with respect to 'flow phase'.

Long-term trends in inflowing chlorophyll a and nutrients and their relation to dissolved oxygen in a large western reservoir. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX.Anoxia in Brownlee Reservoir is one of the numerous water quality issues associated with eutrophic conditions in the Snake River as it flows through southern Idaho and parts of eastern Oregon. The states of Idaho and Oregon have developed total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for multiple reaches of the Snake River and its tributaries upstream of Brownlee Reservoir intended to address poor water quality. Despite the emphasis on developing TMDLs throughout the Snake River and its tributaries, published long-term trend monitoring to evaluate the results of the TMDLs is lacking. Trends in Snake River concentrations and loads summarized using weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season show that combined efforts to improve water quality upstream of Brownlee Reservoir have realized decreasing trends in concentrations of chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and suspended solids (80%, 46%, and 61% reductions, respectively) from 1995 to 2021. Brownlee Reservoir, a large mainstem reservoir with short residence time, has responded quickly to inflowing reductions of chlorophyll a and total phosphorus. Since 2005, dissolved oxygen (DO) has improved in the reservoir, with a 33% reduction in the volume of the reservoir having DO less than 1 mg/L. This supports the primary premise of upstream TMDLs and demonstrates that inflowing water quality improvements are effective at improving in-reservoir dissolved oxygen.

We estimated lake retention time (LRT) as a ratio of lake volume to the inflow and outflow terms of a lake water balance equation. The LRT was evaluated for lakes of epiglacial and landlocked types, and it was assumed that these lakes are monomictic, with water exchange occurring during the warm season only. We used hydrological observations collected in four seasonal field campaigns to evaluate the LRT. For the epiglacial lakes Progress and Nella/Scandrett, the LRT was estimated at 12-13 and 4-5 years, respectively. For the landlocked lakes Stepped, Sarah Tarn and Reid, our results show a great difference in the LRT calculated from the outflow and inflow terms of the water balance equation. The LRTs for these lakes vary depending on the methods and errors inherent to them. We relied on the estimations from the outflow terms, since they are based on hydrological measurements with better quality. Lake Stepped exchanged water within 1.5 years. Sarah Tarn and Lake Reid are endorheic ponds, with water loss mainly through evaporation. Their LRTs were estimated as 21-22 and 8-9 years, respectively. To improve the LRT estimates, special hydrological observations are needed to monitor the lakes and streams during the warm season with a uniform observational programme.

Life and land engulfed in the late Early Jurassic Karoo lavas of southern Gondwana	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												The rock record from the late Early Jurassic in southern Africa encompasses the history of voluminous continental flood basalt outpourings associated with the magmatic events in the Karoo-Ferrar Large Igneous Province (LIP) in southern and eastern Gondwana. This multiphase magmatism produced one of Earth's largest continental flood basalt successions volumetrically and is assumed to have been a main driving mechanism in late Early Jurassic global environmental perturbations, including mass extinctions and changes in climate. In southern Africa, these Lower Jurassic flood basalts are interbedded with fossiliferous sedimentary rocks, which in turn host the last signs of 'Karoo life' in the form of fossil plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, including the trackways of hopping mammals and the ultimate Karoo dinosaurs. The sedimentology and palaeontology of the interbeds archived depositional and biotic processes in running water as well as in and around shallow, up to similar to 10 m deep freshwater lakes and ponds in the late Early Jurassic. This study explains how a complex freshwater palaeo-habitat prevailed - albeit temporarily - in this extremely stressful environment, which was unlike any modern volcanic system. The evidence collectively points to seasonally wet, warm temperate climatic conditions during the early phases of Karoo volcanism. Moreover, the evidence in the rocks also suggests that the dynamic volcanic conditions resulted in shifting habitats that likely facilitated the migration of the ultimate Karoo biota towards the north and west, away from the main Karoo land of fire, just before Gondwana started to disassemble. This refinement of the environmental dynamics in southern Gondwana presented herein lays the groundwork for future high-resolution volcanological, geochronological and chemostratigraphical studies aimed at the nuanced understanding of the global environmental effect of the Karoo-Ferrar LIP.

For this purpose, the multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and absolute principal component score-multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) model have been employed. It was tried to determine the seasonal pollution sources of physicochemical parameters and toxic metals obtained from 22 different sampling points between the years of 2015 and 2017. PCA was applied to the datasets, and 6 varimax factors describing 84%, 80%, 76%, and 79% of the total variance for each season were extracted. The obtained factors were analyzed using the APCS-MLR model for the apportionment of various pollution sources affecting physicochemical parameters and toxic metals. The results show that the natural soil structure, municipal-industrial wastewater, agricultural-atmospheric runoff, highways, and seasonal effects are the major pollution sources for toxic metals and physicochemical parameters. The material contribution of pollutant sources to toxic metals and physicochemical parameters was calculated and verified by the concentrations analyzed. Consequently, multivariate statistical techniques are useful to determine the physicochemical parameters and toxic metals through reciprocal correlation and assess the seasonal impact of pollutant sources in the basin. This study also provides a basis for the creation of measurement programs, determination of pollution sources, and provision of sustainable watershed management regarding other water resources.

J	Mineeva, NM				Mineeva, Natalya M.			Assessment of the relationship between chlorophyll content and biogenic elements in large lowland resevoirs	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA												In the second half of the 20th century, with increased rates of eutrophication, universal quantitative relationships between the content of biogenic elements and chlorophyll (Chl) were obtained, which serves as a marker of algae biomass, as well as an indicator of the trophic status of water bodies. Most of these studies were performed on lakes, however, the patterns and ratios found for lakes were not always observed in reservoirs, young ecosystems with high development dynamics. Long-term studies of phytoplankton productivity are carried out in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga. These studies have shown that a direct relationship of Chl with total nitrogen (N-tot) and phosphorus (P-tot) is rarely found and is at low correlation coefficients. A more successful attempt was to indirectly assess this relationship using the ratios of Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot, which was named "phytoplankton response" (Vinberg, 1987) corresponding to the term "efficiency" (Kalf, Knoechel, 1978). Our first data on Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot in the Upper Volga reservoirs refer to 1980-1990 (Mineeva and Razgulin, 1995; Mineeva, 1993; Mineeva, 2004). At present, new data have been obtained, which have made it possible to follow long-term trends in the development of phytoplankton in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga in connection with the availability of biogenic elements under variations in the trophic status of the reservoirs. Samples were collected in August 2015-2018 at 26 stations in three large reservoirs of the Upper Volga (56 degrees 51'-58 degrees 22'N, 35 degrees 55'-38 degrees 25'E): Ivankovo, Uglich and Rybinsk reservoirs. Chlorophyll content was determined by the fluorescence method (Gol'd et al., 1986) in integral water samples taken from the surface to the bottom. Data on biogenic elements obtained at the same time by Dr Irina Stepanova are given in our joint publication (Mineeva et al., 2021). The standard software packages for a personal computer were used for statistical processing (calculation of mean values and standard error of the mean (M +/- m(M)), correlation and variation coefficients, regression equations and graphing). In this research, we revealed that nutrient content in the Upper Volga reservoirs varied within similar limits, the average N-tot/P-tot ratio was the same, and the average values of P-tot and N-tot decreased in Rybinsk reservoir. Chl content was typical of the summer phytoplankton maximum in the Upper Volga reservoirs (See Table 1). P-tot content did not change much in Ivankovo and Uglich reservoirs, but in Rybinsk reservoir it increased in 2015 and decreased in 2016. The more stable content of N-tot decreased a little in the cool 2017. Chl concentrations of 20-30 mu g/L obtained in Rybinsk reservoir in 2015 and 2018, in Uglich reservoir in 2017 and in Ivankovo reservoir in 2015 correspond to the eutrophic category; concentrations of 35-52 mu g/L (Rybinsk reservoir in 2016, Uglich reservoir in 2015, 2016 and 2018, Ivankovo reservoir in 2016-2018) - to hypertrophic category, and only in 2017 in Rybinsk reservoir did they decrease to a moderately eutrophic level of 13 mu g/L (See Fig. 1). It was found out that under these conditions Chl content per unit of biogenic elements varied in a wide range: Chl/P-tot from 0,03 to 2,13, Chl/N-tot from 2,55 to 123, with maximum values in the highly eutrophic Shosha reach in Ivankovo reservoir (August 2018). Chl/N-tot slightly differed in Ivankovo and Uglich reservoirs, but increased in Rybinsk reservoir; Chl/P-tot decreased in the range of Ivankovo, Uglich and Rybinsk reservoirs (See Table 1). Most of both ratios belong to narrower limits: 0.10-0.50 for Chl/P-tot (67% of all values) and 10-40 for Chl/N-tot (51%) (See Table 2). The average Chl/P-tot ratio for the entire data set is 0.43 +/- 0.03, and Chl/N-tot is 29.8 +/- 1.9 with variation coefficients of 77.0 and 63.9%. The interannual changes (See Fig. 1) show that all the maximum ratios were obtained in 2016, while the minimum in Ivankovo reservoir was in 2015, in Rybinsk reservoir in 2015 and 2017 and in Uglich reservoir in 2017 and 2018. Our results demonstrate that both ratios correlate with each other (See Fig. 2), as well as with the Chl content (See Fig. 3). The correlation of both ratios with Chl weakens in Ivankovo reservoir, probably due to the abundant development of macrophytes. We can observe the same in all reservoirs in the cool 2017 with a decrease in Chl(Cya)n (the abundance of cyanoprokaryotes) and an increase in the proportion of Chl(Bac) (the abundance of diatoms). Both ratios are insignificantly dependent on hydrological factors as well as on P-tot and N-tot content, but the situation can change in individual reservoirs and in different years of observation (See Table 3). As it was demonstrated, both ratios increase with the growth of trophy estimated by Chl. They do not significantly differ in mesotrophic and moderately eutrophic waters, but become much higher in eutrophic and highly eutrophic waters, indicating a more efficient consumption of nutrients in the latter. At the same time, P-tot and N-tot change little along the Chl gradient (See Table 4). Chl/P-tot decreases with the increase in P-tot and grows slightly with the increase in N-tot; Chl/N-tot does not change over the entire range of P-tot and N-tot; but both ratios vary along the gradient of N-tot/P-tot (See Table 5) that serves as an indicator of the biogenic limitation of phytoplankton and a factor regulating the development of algae. A retrospective analysis shows significant interannual fluctuations of both ratios in Rybinsk reservoir and a tendency to increase them in Uglich and Ivankovo reservoirs (See Fig. 1). Thus, Chl/P-tot and Chl/N-tot ratios are useful for analyzing the relationship between the development of phytoplankton and nutrient supply that is necessary in order to assess the efficiency of their use and their availability to algae cells. The results obtained allow us to conclude that phytoplankton in the Upper Volga reservoirs is less sensitive to the presence of nitrogen and more dependent on phosphorus.

Vertical transmission of microcystins to Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) eggs	TOXICON												Cyanobacteria or blue green algae are known for their extensive and highly visible blooms in eutrophic, stagnant freshwater bodies. Climate change and global warming have also contributed to a rise in toxic cyanobacterial blooms. One of the most important cyanobacteria is Microcystis aeruginosa, which can synthesize various microcystins that can affect the health of terrestrial and aquatic animals. Commercial Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) farming in South Africa is based on keeping breeders (adult males and females) in big dams on farms (captive-bred approach). Unfortunately, cyanobacterial blooms in the breeder dams are a concern to farm owners, managers and veterinarians. The main objectives of this research project were to determine if microcystins were present in the contents of crocodile eggs and the liver and yolk of dead hatchlings, and to determine if the reduced hatchability on commercial farms might be caused by these toxins. Furthermore, the concentration of microcystins in the breeder dam was monitored on a monthly basis spanning the ovulation and egg laying period. During the hatching season microcystin concentrations in unfertilised eggs, egg shell membranes and in the yolk and liver of dead hatchlings were determined using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Microcystins were detected in Nile crocodile egg and hatchling samples. Microcystin (MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-YR) concentrations in the crocodile egg and hatchling samples collected from clutches with a good hatching rate (>= 90%) ranged between 0 and 1.76 ng g(-1), with the highest concentration in the egg shell membranes. Microcystin concentrations in samples collected from clutches with a bad hatching rate (<= 10%) ranged from 0 - 1.63 ng g(-1) with the highest concentration detected in the hatchling yolk. However, the concentrations were probably underestimated as the percentage recovery from spiked samples was very low with the extraction method employed. Bayesian analysis suggests that the liver, yolk and unfertilised egg all have similar microcystin concentrations, while the membranes have (with moderate to high certainty) higher microcystin concentrations. There appears to be no difference in microcystin concentrations among good and bad clutches across all tissue types or within a specific tissue type, but due to the small sample size, it was not possible to determine whether microcystin affected the hatchability of Nile crocodile eggs.

Temporal variations in lake CO2 emissions are pronounced, with algal growth and precipitation identified as important drivers. Eutrophic lakes often act as atmospheric CO2 sinks during the growing season. However, these lakes can also emit CO2 during the same period, a paradox that we hypothesize is driven by precipitation. This study tests this hypothesis and examines how rainstorms influence lake CO2 emissions. To investigate, seven buoys were deployed in eutrophic Lake Taihu and a major inflow river to monitor water quality at 4-h intervals throughout 2021. CO2 flux (FCO2) was calculated using integrated methods, including gas diffusion models, the CO2calc program, and machine learning algorithms, based on water quality and meteorological data. Results revealed that only rainstorms (daily rainfall >50 mm) significantly increased FCO2. Although only three rainstorm events occurred, they accounted for 12.15% of the annual CO2 emissions. During the growing season, the lake was a net CO2 source, but without rainstorm-induced emissions, it would have functioned as a CO2 sink, highlighting the crucial role of rainstorms in shifting lake dynamics. Piecewise structural equation modeling indicated that both abiotic factors (e.g., gas transfer velocity) and biotic factors (e.g., aquatic metabolism) influenced by rainstorms contributed to the elevated FCO2. These findings suggest that future reductions in lake FCO2 due to eutrophication, combined with more frequent rainstorms under climate change, could amplify the impact of extreme precipitation on CO2 emissions.

These stresses have impacted littoral macroinvertebrate communities. However, bioassessment and rehabilitation have been largely carried out offshore, and the inshore macroinvertebrates have received less attention especially in shallow plateau lakes. In this study, we compared inshore and offshore macroinvertebrate communities in a shallow plateau lake, Lake Dianchi, China. The environmental parameters determining the distribution of macroinvertebrates were analyzed with partial redundancy analysis. Our results showed that macroinvertebrate communities differed significantly between inshore and offshore. Taxonomic richness was much higher inshore than offshore, due to higher habitat heterogeneity. By contrast, both density and biomass inshore were significantly lower than those of offshore. Generally, vegetation and substrate type were the key environmental parameters shaping macroinvertebrate communities. Eutrophication exerted great effect on offshore communities, while its impacts on inshore communities varied spatially. Shoreline degradation and seasonal eutrophication effects resulted in the limited density and biomass of inshore communities. Our results emphasized the significance of inshore habitats for macroinvertebrates in Lake Dianchi, and provided important implications for bioassessment and ecological rehabilitation in shallow lakes.					wang, shuran/KFF-5332-2024; liu, yong/AAD-1467-2019; Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008; Liu, Xueqin/F-9565-2013	Wang, Shuran/0000-0003-1987-9273; Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2018	70						10	19		10.1016/j.limno.2018.03.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2018.03.002													WOS:000438764800002

Variographic analysis and ordinary kriging interpolation were used to identify and describe spatiotemporal patterns of variability in these parameters, which are relevant to understand the dynamics of water circulation on the floodplain lake. In spite of the complexity of the processes underlying the spatiotemporal patterns, this approach demonstrated that the heterogeneity in the seasonal water composition is forced not only by the Amazon River flood pulse, but also by the lake bottom topography and the wind intensity.

Visual pigments of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) and whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) morphs in subarctic lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Foraging trait specialization is important for polymorphic Arctic charr and whitefish, but visual capabilities of different morphs are unexplored. Photoreceptor complements and absorbance spectra of rod visual pigments were studied by microspectrophotometry in two sympatric Arctic charr morphs and three sympatric whitefish morphs from two subarctic lakes. Four spectral classes of photoreceptor cells, rods and three types of cones, were found in all morphs of both species. Arctic charr rods had a pure A1 pigment (rhodopsin) with wavelength of maximum absorbance lambda (max) ae 511-512 nm and no significant differences either between littoral and profundal morphs or sampling times (January/August). Rods of littoral and pelagic whitefish had practically pure A2 pigment (porphyropsin), whereas profundal whitefish had chromophore mixtures with A2:A1 ae 0.8:0.2 in June, A1 decreasing to a smaller fraction in September. lambda (max) values of littoral and pelagic whitefish rods were similar and did not change significantly with season (539.3 +/- 0.3 nm/539.3 +/- 1.1 nm and 538.4 +/- 0.4/539.8 +/- 0.3 nm in June/September) but differed from profundal whitefish (lambda (max) = 531.5 +/- 0.8/536.7 +/- 1.0 nm). Differences between Arctic charr and whitefish morphs suggest importance of local light environment determining visual pigment composition.					; Smura, Teemu/C-4063-2016; Smura, Teemu/K-6421-2012	Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216; Donner, Kristian/0000-0001-7833-4236; Smura, Teemu/0000-0002-9187-3151													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2016	783	1					223	237		10.1007/s10750-015-2588-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2588-3													WOS:000387222500017

Although there is relatively a large amount of information on this climatic variability from the lowlands during this time period, little is known regarding the environmental variability in the middle elevations. Here we present evidence of environmental change from a lacustrine sedimentary record recovered from Lake Lacandin, a small shallow water body located in the middle elevations of Chiapas, Mexico. Through analyses of cladoceran assemblages and chemical properties of the sediments (concentrations of C, Ca, N, Rb, Sr, Ti, and Zr), we aimed to reconstruct local and regional environmental conditions during the last 4,000 years. Our results show a highly dynamic cladoceran community apparently associated with changes in the size of the lake, which although variable has been enlarging through the last 4,000 years. Geochemical evidence also suggests high variability in moisture availability overimposed on a general trend towards drier conditions. Whereas the growing lake size seems associated with decreasing insolation seasonality, the trend to drier regional climates corresponds to the well-known southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone through the Holocene. Although the regional climate has been deteriorating, the enlarging lake suggests a decreasing water deficit though time. This pattern is probably a result of increasing insolation during the dry season, causing advection of marine moisture that precipitates because of the steep elevation gradient. Our results highlight the intricate nature of the millennial scale environmental variability, and the potential role of the middle elevations for sheltering biodiversity through times of environmental hardship.

J	Peterson, EB				Peterson, EB			Estimating cover of an invasive grass (Bromus tectorum) using tobit regression and phenology derived from two dates of Landsat ETM plus data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) is an annual Eurasian grass that has invaded rangelands of the western USA. Being both a fire follower and a fire promoter, it can rapidly exclude native vegetation and is among the greatest threats to conservation in the region. Key to land management is a strong understanding of B. tectorum distribution and density. Percentage ground cover of B. tectorum was estimated and mapped as a continuous variable over 13.3 million ha in Nevada, USA. Estimation involved a statistical model derived from 262 training plots, two dates of six scenes from Landsat 7 ETM + imagery collected in 2001, and elevation. Absence of B. tectorum in many plots led to a dataset that was left-censored at zero for the response variable, B. tectorum ground cover. Tobit regression, a method for modelling censored data, was found to produce a better model from these data than ordinary least squares regression. The two dates of the imagery were used to derive a variable representing phenology of the landscape. The derived phenology (in quadratic form), elevation, and the late-season green band were statistically significant in the model development. Additionally, a brightness index was used to limit estimates in bright and dark portions of the imagery such as playas and lakes. Final map accuracy determined from an additional 75 independent assessment plots showed good correspondence between sampled and estimated B. tectorum ground cover (r=0.71) and the root-mean-square error for estimated ground cover is 9.1%.																			0143-1161	1366-5901				JUN 20	2005	26	12					2491	2507		10.1080/01431160500127815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160500127815													WOS:000230731900002

The results demonstrated that microecology in the lake exhibits spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and microbial diversity of sediments was significantly higher than that of water body. Further, it was found that there was statistically insignificant positive correlation between microecology of sediments and that of water body. PCoA and community structure analysis revealed that the predominant phyla which exhibited significant spatial differences in sediments were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes. While, the distribution of dominant bacteria Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia in water body showed significant seasonal differences. Microbial networks analysis indicated that there was a cooperative symbiotic relationship between lake microbial communities. Notably, the same bacterial genus had no significant positive correlation in sediment and water, which suggested that bacteria transport between sediment-water interface does not influence the microecological functions of lake water.

A long-term study on nutrient retention	WATER RESEARCH												Assessing nutrient loading and processing is crucial for water quality management in lakes and reservoirs. Quantifying and reducing external nutrient inputs in these systems remains a significant challenge. The difficulty arises from low monitoring frequencies of the highly dynamic external inputs and the limited availability of measures to reduce diffuse source loading. One option for the latter is the use of pre-dams, i.e. small impoundments at the inflow points into reservoirs, designed to retain nutrients by algal uptake and sedimentation. This study analyzes long-term (ranging from 8 to 22 years) nutrient and discharge time series for nine German pre-dams to assess their retention capacity. For that, we (i) quantified nutrient loading using four different mathematical methods, (ii) derived their retention efficiencies, and (iii) identified environmental factors determining the retention of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silica (Si). We show that retention of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (43.6 %) and total phosphorus (TP) (39.9 %) is far higher than for nitrate (NO3) (15.3 %) and Si (15.9 %). The retention efficiency for SRP and TP was higher during the warm seasons because of higher algal nutrient uptake and thus higher nutrient sedimentation. Mixed effects models documented a significant positive effect of the pre-dams' hydraulic residence time (HRT) on retention efficiency. Pre-dams provide substantial service in retaining nutrients and help to protect downstream waterbodies from nutrient inputs. They provide effective measures for trapping nutrients including those originating from non-point sources.

However, few studies have beenconducted to investigate the combined effects of climate change and water withdrawal on the Lake's water balance using climatechange and water withdrawal for irrigation datasets. We used High-resolution multiple climate models and Representative ConcentrationPathways (RCP) scenarios to assess the impact of climatic variables for two future periods: 2021-2050 and 2051-2080. Rainfall and temp-erature data biases were corrected using power transformation and variance scaling methods, respectively. The Hydrologiska Byr & aring;nsVattenbalansavdelning (HBV) hydrological model was employed to simulate surface inflow into Ziway Lake from the Meki and Katar sub-catchments. The FAO CROPWAT model was used to estimate the irrigation water demand of major crops grown in the study area. The resultsindicate that future temperatures and wet season runoff levels are expected to rise. Under the worst climate change scenario, climatechange and water withdrawal from the Lake for agriculture may cause the lake level to drop by 25 cm per year, resulting in a 10 km2surfacearea and 101 Mm3 volume reductions. Therefore, implementing preventive measures, proper planning and careful monitoring of lake wateruse is advised.

The Gangotri glacier, one of the most dynamic and relatively well-documented glacial system, is longest valley glaciers out of 968 glaciers scattered over the Uttarakhand Himalayan Range. Although extensive mapping has been carried out, the retrieved data set still lacks unanimous understanding on the pattern of retreat and also its geomorphic response. Furthermore, inadequate and isolated information from dendrochronology, sedimentology, mineral magnetism, palynology, black carbon deposition, geochronology and palaeoclimatic approaches preclude understanding on the chronologic correlation and glacial stratigraphy. However, climate change urgently demands in-depth information on flashfloods and such processes responsible for landscape modification. The Gangotri glacier has experienced varying rates of retreat since 1935 from as low as 20 m/y, to very high rates of 30-50 m/y (1960 to 1990). During the last few decades, the rate is observed to be decreasing to 10-15 m/y (2015-2021). The geochronology based studies, indicated glacier terminus around 3.7 km down during similar to 200-300 yrs B.P from its position in 1992. This was clarified by tree colonization pattern study in the glacier forefields, which precisely established for the first time that the Gangotri glacier terminus receded only similar to 63 meters during 1571-1934 C.E. of total recede similar to 1.853 km in the past 447 years (1571 to July 2017). The Gangotri Glacier Region (GGR) exhibits stratified as well as unstratified glacial and non-glacial landforms. The unstratified glacial deposits represent Lateral Moraines (LM) and Recessional Moraines (RM), whereas the stratified deposits occur as Outwash Plains (OWP) and Kame Terraces (KT). The non-glacial landforms are unstratified Debris Cones (DC), Pillar Structures (PS) and stratified Flash Flood Deposits (FFD). The sedimentary analysis describes that the OWP sediments are poorly sorted medium sand evolved by glacio-fluvial processes, whereas sediments of KT are well-sorted sand and silt evolved by a combination of two depositional environments, the glacio-fluvial at the base and lacustrine at the top. Palynological analysis revealed the presence of pollen-spores of local terrestrial herbaceous as well as marshy taxa, along with temperate tree taxa, transported from lower altitudes in good amount during the Early Holocene. The carbon isotopic analysis indicated that the GGR is characterized by both C-3-C-4 i.e. mixed type of vegetation. The average value in the weight % of BC is 0.07 and the weight % of delta C-13(BC) is -25.2 parts per thousand, which is close to atmospheric aerosols containing vehicular emissions mainly during the common traffic (similar to -26 parts per thousand). The mineral magnetic analysis of KT reflects dominance of detrital influx depicting warm episodes having well-oxygenated ponding conditions that ended with restricted cold climatic events. A combination of geochronology, sedimentology and mineral magnetic studies were integrated with other proxies to build up the Late Quaternary stratigraphy in this region. Tributary glaciers, snow melt ephemeral streams, mass movements, landslide lake outburst flooding (LLOF), and glacier lake outburst flooding (GLOF) are considered as important phenomena, which affects the glacial signatures and creates vision in identification of the landforms. The modification of glacial landforms and landscape of GGR are the main reasons for diversified opinion on glacial history. The geochronology of various sections of the glacial stratified deposits provide the record of climate change of last 25 Ka BP with major warm and cold events such as the Last Glacial Maximum (21-19.5 Ka BP), Older Dryas (16.5-14.5 Ka BP), Bolling-Allerod (14.5-13.5 Ka BP), Younger Dryas (13.5-12 Ka BP), Indus Valley Civilization Collapse (5.0-3.0 Ka BP), Medieval Warm Period (1.25-0.7 Ka BP) and Little Ice Age (0.7 -0.2 Ka BP). The geomorphic features such as Terminal Moraines (62.89 +/- 8.58 Ka BP), Oldest Lateral Moraines (similar to 60 Ka BP), Oldest Outwash Plains (similar to 60 Ka BP), Kame Terraces (25.0 - 0.3 Ka BP), Old Lateral Moraines (17.56 +/- 4.11- 4.84 +/- 1.21 Ka BP), Old Outwash Plains (5.13 +/- 1.54 - 3.3 Ka BP), Debris Cones (5.2- 1.8 Ka BP), New Lateral Moraines (1.0- 0.35 Ka BP) and New Outwash Plains (1.82 - 1.0 Ka BP) are the main glacial stratigraphic units and sequences. This paper presents the glacial stratigraphy and the overview on geological analysis in the GGR in light of rate of retreat, dendrochronologic attributes, geomorphological imprints, sedimentologic signatures, mineral magnetic response, palynological distribution, carbon deposition, flash floods events, processes of landscape modification, geochronology, and major climatic events, which may provide significant inputs in understanding other glaciated regions in the Himalaya.

J	Silvoso, J; Izaguirre, I; Allende, L				Silvoso, Julieta; Izaguirre, Irina; Allende, Luz			Picoplankton structure in clear and turbid eutrophic shallow lakes: A seasonal study	LIMNOLOGICA												The relative abundance of the different picoplankton components (eukaryotic picophytoplankton (Peuk), picocyanobacteria (Pcy) and bacterioplankton), and their relationships with the lake conditions were studied in three types of shallow lakes from the Pampa Plain (Argentina) that differ in their optical properties: clear-vegetated, phytoplankton-turbid and inorganic-turbid. All the selected lakes, but one, are characterized by their different alternative steady state (clear-vegetated and phytoplankton-turbid water phases) following the model proposed by Scheffer et al. (1993). Autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton abundances were analyzed seasonally in relation to environmental variables. All the lakes presented high concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) (>229 mu g L-1), total phosphorus (TP) (>46 mu g L-1) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (>13.7 mg L-1). Clear-vegetated lakes were characterized by vertical diffuse PAR (photosynthetic active radiation) attenuation coefficient (kd(PAR)) lower than 11 m(-1), whereas inorganic-turbid lake always showed values higher than 21.1 m(-1). The euphoric zone depth (Z(1%)) was wider in clear-vegetated lakes (40-140 cm) and thinner in the inorganicturbid (10-20 cm). The phytoplankton-turbid lakes presented a wide range in the values of these variables (kd(PAR): 5.2-35.8 m(-1).; Z(1%): 10-90 cm). Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) strongly differed, ranging from 1.6 to 334.6 mu g L-1. Picophytoplankton was mainly represented by phycocianine-rich (PC-rich) Pcy in all cases, dominating over Peuk algae. The total and relative abundances of eukaryotic picophytoplankton. Pcy and bacterioplankton, as well as the size structure of the phytoplankton community differed among the water bodies. In general, clear-vegetated water bodies exhibited similar abiotic characteristics, picophytoplankton/bacterioplankton ratios, and phytoplankton size structure. Contrarily, no clear trend was identified for the group of turbid lakes. The contrasting results obtained for the importance of the picoplankton components in phytoplankton-turbid shallow lakes evidence that the availability of the energetical and nutrient resources cannot be solely considered to predict their relative importance in this type of shallow lake.

This tropical aquatic ecosystem south of Mexico City is comprised of a network of interconnected canals and lakes that are influenced by agricultural and urban activities. Environmental heterogeneity was characterized by spatially extensive surveys within four regions of Xochimilco during rainy and dry seasons over 2 years. These surveys revealed a heterogeneous system that was shallow (1.1 m, SD = 0.4), warm (17 degrees C, SD = 2.9), well oxygenated (5.0 mg l(-1), SD = 3), turbid (45.7 NTU SD = 26.96), and extremely nutrient-rich (NO(3)-N = 15.9 mg l(-1), SD=13.7; NH(4)-N = 2.88 mg l(-1), SD = 4.24; and PO(4)-P = 8.3 mg l(-1), SD = 2.4). Most of the variables were not significantly different between years, but did differ between seasons, suggesting a dynamic system within a span of a year but with a high resilience over longer periods of time. Maps were produced using interpolations to describe distributions of all variables. There was no correlation between individual variables and land use. Consequently, we searched for relationships using all variables together by generating a combined water quality index. Significant differences in the index were apparent among the four regions. Index values also differed within individual region and individual water bodies (e.g., within canals), indicating that Xochimilco has high local heterogeneity. Using this index on a map helped to relate water quality to human activities and provides a simple and clear tool for managers and policymakers.

Results are analysed from 11 experiments in which effects of fish addition and nutrient loading on shallow lakes were studied in mesocosms. The experiments, five in 1998, six in 1999, were carried out in six lakes, distributed from Finland to southern Spain, according to a standard protocol. 2. Effects of the treatments on 29 standard chemical, phytoplankton and zooplankton variables are examined to assess the relative importance of bottom-up (nutrient enrichment) and top-down (fish predation) effects. For each year, the experiments in different locations are treated as replicates in a meta-analysis. Results of individual experiments are then compared in terms of the patterns of significant influences of nutrient addition and fish predation with these overall results (the baseline), and between years in the same location. 3. The overall meta-analysis gave consistent results across the 2 years, with nutrient loading influencing all of the chemical variables, and on average 31% of primary producer and 39% of zooplankton variables. In contrast, fish influenced none of the chemical variables, 11% of the primary producer and 44% of the zooplankton variables. Nutrient effects on the system were thus about three times greater than fish effects, although fish effects were not inconsiderable. 4. The relative importance of nutrients and fish in individual experiments often differed between years at the same location and effects deviated to varying degrees from the baseline. These deviations were treated as measures of consistency (predictability) of conclusions in repeat experiments. Consistency increased southwards and this is interpreted as a consequence of more variable annual weather northwards. 5. The influence of nutrient loading was greater southwards and this was probably manifested through naturally greater annual macrophyte abundance in warmer locations in consequence of the longer plant growing-season. There was no trend in the relative importance of fish effects with latitude but this may partly be an artefact of the simple fish community used. These findings suggest that nutrient control should be a greater priority than biomanipulation in the restoration of eutrophicated shallow lakes in warm temperate regions. 6. Starting conditions affected the outcome of experiments. High initial concentrations of total phosphorus and planktonic chlorophyll a concentration (created by local conditions prior to the experiment) led to de-emphasis of the importance of nutrient loading in the experiment.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Kuoppamaki, Kirsi/E-8699-2015; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/L-7321-2014; Rueda, Juan/F-6691-2016; Fernández-Aláez, Camino/K-5292-2014; Russell, Vincent/Q-6668-2018; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016; Becares, Eloy/H-6361-2015; Fernández-Aláez, Margarita/L-7321-2014; Ferriol, Carmen/AAC-4591-2020; van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Goma, Joan/C-8485-2017; Gomà, Joan/C-8485-2017	Becares, Eloy/0000-0002-7123-3579; ferriol, carmen/0000-0001-9961-7040; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Kuoppamaki, Kirsi/0000-0002-6703-4024; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/0000-0001-9385-1354; Rueda, Juan/0000-0002-7629-8881; van de Bund, Wouter/0000-0002-2749-0850; Fernandez-Alaez, Margarita/0000-0003-3847-6613; van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Goma, Joan/0000-0002-6312-1948; Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2004	49	12					1633	1649		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01304.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01304.x													WOS:000225316100010

Cougar habitat selection, prey composition, and mortality in a multiple-use landscape	CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE JOURNAL												Western North America is experiencing remarkable human population growth and land-use change. Irrigation and associated cultivation have led to colonization of urban-wildland interface (UWI) environments by mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and consequently, cougars (Puma concolor). In the wake of these changes, human-wildlife conflicts have increased in tandem with questions about long-term species conservation. To address these concerns, we fit 79 cougars with radio-telemetry collars in the Oquirrh Mountains near Salt Lake City, Utah (2002-2010). Our goal was to evaluate variation in cougar habitat selection, diet, and cause-specific mortality in a landscape dominated by urban, military, and industrial activities. We used radio-telemetry data in concert with Resource Selection Functions to address three hypotheses: (1) that cougars would select wildland over UWI land-uses; (2) prey composition would reflect differences in land-use; and (3) mortality would be predominantly human-caused. Cougars largely selected wildland habitats associated with seasonal mule deer presence, but contrary to expectation, they also selected habitats closer to urban and mined areas. Prey composition in the UWI did not differ from wildland habitats. Domestic ungulates represented only 2% of 540 recovered prey items and were found primarily in wildlands. Native ungulates comprised > 90% of the total kill, irrespective of season or land-use, suggesting that use of UWI habitats was linked to mule deer presence. Cougar mortality was disproportionately due to natural causes in wildlands, but individuals that died of human causes in UWI habitats were more likely to be inexperienced hunters, supporting young kittens, or compromised by physical handicaps. In general, presence of mule deer was the key predictor of cougar habitat use, even in this highly disturbed, anthropogenically altered landscape. As such, management designed to reduce conflict and ensure conservation will need to focus on urban deer, land-use planning, and targeted education campaigns to reduce food subsidies.

During the past 60 years, the annual average temperature and precipitation at the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains have increased at the rates of 0.035 degrees C/year and 0.881 mm/year, respectively. Rising temperatures will change the temporal and spatial distributions and forms of precipitation, accelerate glacier retreat, melt snow on high mountains, cause the degeneration of frozen soil, and change the runoff composition in the Tianshan area. In this work, the CMADS (China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Dataset for the SWAT model) was combined with the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model to simulate runoff in the upper reaches of the Jing River and Bo River Basins in the Tianshan area. The results were as follows. (1) On the monthly scale, the average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficients of the calibration period in the Wenquan and Jinghe-Shankou hydrological stations were 0.79 and 0.87, respectively, and the NSE coefficients of validation period were 0.71 and 0.82, respectively. On the daily scale, the NSE coefficients of the two hydrological stations were between 0.69 and 0.77. The simulation results were considered to be ideal on the monthly and daily scales. (2) Under different climate scenarios and land-use patterns, the cultivated land in the basin leads to the reduction of runoff, and the grassland and woodland stabilise the river flood season. Lakes and wetlands, which can reduce the flow in the flood season and provide water for rivers in the dry season, are very important for runoff regulation. Compared with the traditional meteorological stations, CMADS demonstrates good representativeness and reliability in the Jinghe River and Bohe River Basins under different climate and land-use scenarios, greatly improving the runoff simulation ability.

J	Williams, WD				Williams, WD			Environmental threats to salt lakes and the likely status of inland saline ecosystems in 2025	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Salt lakes are geographically widespread, numerous and a significant part of the world's inland aquatic ecosystems. They are important natural assets with considerable aesthetic, cultural, economic, recreational, scientific, conservation and ecological values. Some features, notably the composition of the biota, uniquely distinguish them from other aquatic ecosystems. The paper reviews the nature of environmental impacts and their effects upon salt lakes. Its aims are two-fold: to draw attention to the extensive damage that salt lakes have now undergone, and to indicate the likely status of salt lakes in 2025. Salt lakes develop as the termini of inland drainage basins where hydrological inputs and outputs are balanced. These conditions occur in arid and semi-arid regions (approximately one-third of total world land area). Many human activities threaten or have already impacted salt lakes, especially surface inflow diversions, salinization and other catchment activities, mining, pollution, biological disturbances (e.g. introduction of exotic species), and anthropogenically-induced climatic and atmospheric changes. The effects of such activities are always adverse and include changes to the natural character of salt lakes, loss of biodiversity and fundamental limnological changes. The effects are geographically widespread, mostly irreversible, and degrade the values of salt lakes. Four salt lakes are discussed, namely the Aral Sea in central Asia, Mono Lake in California, USA, and Lake Eyre and Lake Cantara South, in Australia. By 2025, most natural salt lakes will have undergone some adverse change. Many permanent ones will have decreased in size and increased in salinity, and many unnatural saline water-bodies will have appeared. In certain regions, many seasonally-filled salt lakes are likely to be drier for longer periods. The extent to which episodically-filled salt lakes will change by 2025 will largely depend upon the nature of climate change in arid regions. Objective cost/benefit analyses of adversely affecting salt lakes are rare, and international bodies have not properly recognized salt lakes as important inland aquatic ecosystems. To redress this situation, there is a need to raise awareness of (1) the values of salt lakes, (2) the nature of threats and impacts from human activities, and (3) their special management requirements. More effective management and conservation measures need to be implemented. Mono Lake provides an example of what can be achieved in the conservation of salt lakes. Its conservation was largely brought about by (1) the commitment of a non-governmental organization which recognized its non-economic values, (2) the freedom to express views, (3) a legal system which took account of non-economic values, and (4) a legislature which implemented judicial findings. The conservation of Mono Lake was difficult; the conservation of other salt lakes is likely to be even more difficult. Only international pressure from appropriate organizations will be effective for the conservation of many.																			0376-8929	1469-4387				JUN	2002	29	2					154	167		10.1017/S0376892902000103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892902000103													WOS:000178121600003

Rising lake levels in central East Africa are driven by increasing rainfall and land-use intensification	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: 375 lakes across the East African Rift System Study focus: East African Rift System lakes provide a critical region of freshwater biodiversity and support the livelihoods of millions of people. Since 2010, water levels have risen at many Kenyan Rift System lakes flooding settlements, destroying infrastructure and impacting biodiversity, whereas several Ethiopian lakes experienced declining water levels, threatening water availability. However, water storage changes have not been quantified and the drivers of hydrological change have not been assessed on a regional scale. Here, we used satellite Earth observation and open-access data products to quantify changes in lake water volumes, total catchment water storage anomalies and environmental drivers for 375 lakes across the East African Rift System from 2000 to 2023. New hydrological insights for the region: Water storage increased across central East Africa and declined in the south of the Rift System, with lake surface areas increasing by a total of 71,822 km2 and water volumes increasing by 1375.2 km3. Increasing rainfall (Coef = 1.775, SE = 0.571, p = 0.002) and urban development (Coef = 6.270, SE = 2.260, p = 0.006) caused expanding lake surface areas, whereas population growth within catchments reduced both lake surface areas (Coef = -7.023, SE = 2.210, p = 0.002) and water volumes (Coef = -8.735, SE = 3.578, p = 0.020). Increasing rainfall trends (Coef = 4.454, SE = 1.733, p = 0.020) and the expansion of catchment forest cover (Coef = 11.284, SE = 5.263, p = 0.047) facilitated greater water storage within lake basins. With more extreme wet seasons and longer dry seasons predicted for East Africa under climate change, sustainable catchment management is required to mitigate both future flooding and drought events.					; Chadwick, Michael/ABF-6431-2020	Byrne, Aidan/0009-0001-8600-3784; Chadwick, Michael/0000-0003-4891-4357; Tebbs, Emma/0000-0003-0575-1236														2214-5818				DEC	2024	56								101999	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101999													WOS:001332325500001

This study examines the Napo Moist Forest (NMF) ecoregion, mapping permanent and seasonally flooded areas from 2018 to 2021 using remote sensing and deep learning models. We aimed to map these areas at a high spatial resolution (10-m pixels) and analyse their role in maintaining lateral connectivity essential for fish diversity. Using synthetic aperture radar data from Sentinel-1 combined with deep learning algorithms, we produced high-accuracy flood maps to assess landscape connectivity between rivers and floodplains. Our methodology included creating a ground truth dataset with the Normalized Difference Water Index and integrating high-resolution optical data for model training, overcoming challenges of cloud coverage and dense vegetation. Our predictive model achieved high accuracy (mean pixel accuracy = 97 %) and consistently predicted 4801 km2 of surface water, with only 3 % (130 km2) being seasonally flooded areas over four years. The Caqueta<acute accent>, Bajo Marano<acute accent>n, Napo, and Pastaza watersheds accounted for nearly 60 % of the flooded areas, highlighting their ecological importance. Connectivity analysis in three areas of interest within the NMF ecoregion revealed important seasonal and interannual fluctuations in hydrological connectivity due to changes in flooded patch characteristics. Reductions in the number and flooded patch area during low water seasons increased the distance between patches, leading to a disconnection between flooded areas, channels and rivers. Despite hydrological fluctuations, certain patches maintained consistent flooding, critical for lateral connectivity and sustaining aquatic biodiversity. These seasonally flooded areas act as connectors, influencing patch dynamics and connectivity with tributaries. Seasonal and interannual variations in hydrological connectivity are crucial for sustaining fish diversity. Conserving dynamic floodplains supports migratory fish life cycles and biodiversity. This study underscores the importance of high-resolution temporal and spatial data in conservation planning for aquatic ecosystems.

J	Johnson, RK; Toprak, V				Johnson, Richard K.; Toprak, Vildan			Local habitat is a strong determinant of spatial and temporal patterns of macrophyte diversity and composition in boreal lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Macrophyte species and trait assemblages from 104 minimally disturbed boreal forest lakes, covering broad environmental and geographic gradients were analysed to identify associations with environmental variables at different spatial scales: geographic context (GEO) and catchment (CATCH) and lake (LOCAL) characteristics. Constrained ordination and variation partitioning were used to quantify variation in species (canonical correspondence analysis [CCA] and pCCA) and trait (redundancy analysis [RDA] and pRDA) compositions that could be explained by environmental variables, and to rank the main environmental factors associated with spatial and temporal patterns. Diversity and assemblage composition correlated with spatial context and variables related to the length of the growing season, catchment forest type and with lake characteristics such as ecosystem size, lake productivity and alkalinity. Variation partitioning showed that lake characteristics alone explained 53% (species) and 73.5% (traits) of the variability in macrophyte assemblages. Contrary to predictions, the shared variance component between latitude and catchment forest type (GEO&CATCH < 0.1% for both species and traits) and between latitude and lake characteristics (GEO&LOCAL = 6.7% for species and 3.9% for traits) was low. Temporal variability, measured as changes in species richness, diversity and a pollution-specific index (the Trophic Macrophyte Index), using a subset of the lakes sampled on two occasions (19 lakes sampled in 2012 and 2018 and five lakes sampled in 2013 and 2019) did not differ (p > 0.05, paired t-test). Ordination showed that among-year variability in macrophyte assemblage composition was also negligible (0.3%) compared to the variability explained by GEO, CATCH and LOCAL variables. Combined, these findings indicate low species turnover in the boreal lakes of our study. Responses of macrophyte species and trait assemblages and the TMI index were predictable and significantly correlated with lake characteristics associated with nutrient enrichment (Chl a, nutrients) and alkalinity supporting their use in monitoring eutrophication of boreal lakes.

The mean concentration of & sum;OPEs in Hangzhou Bay (235.3 ng/g) was slightly lower than that in the East China Sea (273.5 ng/g), with detected analytes dominated by Diethyl phosphate, Tris(2-chloropropyl) phosphate, and Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate. Based on principal component analysis and cluster analysis for the source apportionment of OPEs, the results indicated that the high levels of OPEs in the East China Sea close to Yangtze River estuary can be attributed to a significant large-scale OPEs production site located along the southern Yellow Sea and the western coast of the East China Sea. Furthermore, the risk assessment conducted on aquatic organisms indicated the non-ecological risk of OPEs. However, future research should focus on the potential composite impacts of OPEs on the water systems and human health.					ge, linke/NID-5673-2025														0025-326X	1879-3363				JAN	2025	210								117332	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.117332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.117332		NOV 2024						39615336					WOS:001371331900001

Infrasonic tracking of large bubble bursts and ash venting at Erebus Volcano, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Explosive degassing at Erebus Volcano produces infrasound that can be used to locate, characterize, and quantify eruptive activity from multiple vents. We use a three element distributed microphone network to pinpoint eruption sources and track the activity at the prominent vents through time. Eruptive mechanisms for both source types are analyzed in conjunction with the telemetered time-synced video imagery. We identify two commonly active vents corresponding to the large (often > 10-m diameter) bubble bursts at the free surface of a persistent phonolitic lava lake ('Ray Lake'), and the less frequent ash-rich eruptions from a constricted vent ('Active Vent') located similar to 80 In from the lava lake. During a 3-month study interval from 6 January to 13 April 2006 we identified and mapped more than 350 eruptive sources from the lava lake and 20 sources from the ash vent Lava lake events are characterized by high-amplitude infrasonic transients that reflect rapid (less than a few s) acceleration and rupture of magma bubble films followed by an explosion of pressurized gases. Precise infrasonic localization of the lava lake events to accuracies of a few m indicates variable bubble source locations across a 40 by 50-m region spanning the lava lake. Spatial variability is corroborated by the video data. In contrast, degassing from the ash vent produces longer-duration (tens of s), lower amplitude transients that reflect diminished impulsivity and an extended degassing duration, features that are corroborated by video. Because infrasound networks can operate continuously in all weather conditions and during both diurnal and seasonal polar darkness, and are easily incorporated into automatic processing, they significantly contribute to the completeness and quantification of eruption catalogues for Erebus.

Planktonic indicators of water quality: A case study in the Amacuzac River Basin (State of Morelos, Mexico)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Planktonic organisms are good indicators of water quality but are rarely used in Mexican riverine studies in spite of the high level of contamination in these lotic waters. In this study, we focused on the plankton of the river Amacuzac in Mexico and a large saline waterbody, Lake Tequisquitengo, which is located in the Amacuzac river basin. We collected samples at three sites in the River Amacuzac and one at Lake Tequisquitengo from May 2015 to March-April of 2016. We analysed the physicochemical variables, coliform bacteria, and biological oxygen demand levels. We also quantified phytoplankton and zooplankton. Our results indicate that the study sites are mesotrophic with high densities of diatoms and cyanobacteria. Among the zooplankton, the dominant organisms were rotifers. The constancy of planktonic taxa was high in the lake but low in the river. The Descy index ranged from 2.9 to 4.5 in the river and from 4.0 to 5.0 in the lake. The saprobic index shows that the system is beta-mesosaprobic. The species diversity was higher in the river than in the lake.

J	Svanberg, J				Svanberg, J			Albertus!Pictor's portraits of himself and of his contemporaries	KONSTHISTORISK TIDSKRIFT												Albertus Pictor, the Latinized form of the name he used himself when he signed his work, was an immigrant from Immenhausen in Germany who settled in the Swedish town of Arboga in 1465. Then he is documented in Stockholm from 1473 to his death in 1509. In Swedish sources he is called Albrekt the Painter or Albrekt the Embroiderer since he evidently practised both crafts. Together with his team he decorated 30 churches in the the three provinces around Lake Malaren, as we know from his signature in almost a third of them. The rest of the church paintings have been attributed to him on stylistic grounds and so have all the embroideries. In this period church painters often signed their work but embroiderers never did. Albertus Pictor left a self-portrait under his signature in one of the first churches he painted, namely in Lid (Fig. 1a). He is kneeling in the direction of the altar and his prayer is written in Latin in the scroll above him... remember me Albert painter of this church (in literal translation). He is represented as a young, elegant man. Unfortunately most of the face is very worn but we can still see that he has rather full, blond hair. A corresponding figure is to be seen in the church of Harkeberga (Fig. 2 to the extreme right) where the paintings in the vaults, including this one, have never been whitewashed over. It is thus well preserved but for the red colour, which has turned black over the centuries. The Latin prayer in the scroll above the kneeling man reads in translation: Have pity on me, oh God, according to your great mercifulness! (Psalter 51:3). Even if his name is lacking here he is speaking in the first person. In all probability this is another self-portrait, made some twenty years after the first one. He is dressed in the same way as before but his clothes are in other colours and he is no longer so slim. While he is painted to the right of a representation of the miraculous Mass of Saint Gregory, where Christ himself appeared on the altar, there is a tonsured monk painted to the left of this scene (Fig. 2). It might be a Grey Friar from a nearby convent who used to preach in the parish church of Harkeberga. In Lid the vicar Lars is painted kneeling in his chasuble and with his name and title written in the scroll above him (Fig. 1b) as a counterpart to the painter's self-portrait (cf. Fig. 1a). In this church Albertus has also painted the donor kneeling behind his coat of arms (half a unicorn, Fig. 3). Jacob Ulfsson, archbishop of Sweden for 45 years (1470-1515) has been portrayed kneeling behind the escutcheon with his coat of arms (the foot of an eagle) twice by Albertus, once in the role of embroiderer and once as a painter. The embroidery is to be found on the so-called chasuble of St. Mary in Uppsala Cathedral and is dated 1482 (Fig. 4). He is represented in full pontifical robe, which is meticulously rendered in all its details in the embroidery, including his pallium, the insignium that Was particular to an archbishop. The painting is found on the eastern wall of the chancel in the small church of Yttergran, which is situated near the summer residence of the archbishops (Biskops-Arno). But in this painting dated around 1480 - i.e. contemporary with the embroidery - the archbishop is looking younger and his pallium is lacking (Fig. 5). In the second vault of the church in Osmo Albertus has painted a pair of donors: the knight Erengisle Nilsson and his wife Birgitta Olofsdotter of the famous Tott family (Fig. 7). In the parish church of Bromma he has painted an anonymous master-mason who with his axe is hitting a bricklayer (Fig. 8). An illumination is also ascribed to Albertus, namely the portrait of Tord the master-mason, now chairman of the guild, which is the frontispiece and only picture in the book of the masons' guild in Stockholm, dated 1487 (Fig. 9). He is represented laying bricks under the scroll with his name and titles in Swedish. A wooden relief on the front of the castle under the princess in the famous group representing Saint George fighting the dragon in St Nicholas' church in Stockholm (fig 10) is very interesting to compare. After his victory over the dragon St George inspects how a church is being built. There we can see a mason laying bricks (his trowel is partly broken away now). He has the same hat and dress as in the frontispiece from 1487. At the top there is another bricklayer, presumably the foreman, using a plummet to check that the wall is straight and his tounge is coming out of his mouth in the same way as in the frontispiece. The sculpture was inaugurated in 1489. And the relief probably reminded its contemporaries of the renovation of the City Church (St Nicholas) in the 1480s under the leadership of master masons Tord and Jens. The realism of the portrayal would have made such an association inevitable.																			0023-3609	1651-2294					2005	74	3					148	161		10.1080/00233600510043346	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00233600510043346													WOS:000233428600002

Sunspots, El Nino, and the levels of Lake Victoria, East Africa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												An association of high sunspot numbers with rises in the level of Lake Victoria, East Africa, has been the focus of many investigations and vigorous debate during the last century. In this paper, we show that peaks in the similar to 11- year sunspot cycle were accompanied by Victoria level maxima throughout the 20th century, due to the occurrence of positive rainfall anomalies similar to 1 year before solar maxima. Similar patterns also occurred in at least five other East African lakes, which indicates that these sunspot-rainfall relationships were broadly regional in scale. Although irradiance fluctuations associated with the sunspot cycle are weak, their effects on tropical rainfall could be amplified through interactions with sea surface temperatures and atmospheric circulation systems, including ENSO. If this Sun-rainfall relationship persists in the future, then sunspot cycles can be used for long-term prediction of precipitation anomalies and associated outbreaks of insect-borne disease in much of East Africa. In that case, unusually wet rainy seasons and Rift Valley Fever epidemics should occur a year or so before the next solar maximum, which is expected to occur in 2011-2012 AD.					; Conway, Declan/HCH-7778-2022	verburg, piet/0000-0001-7574-9161; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				AUG 7	2007	112	D15							D15106	10.1029/2006JD008362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JD008362													WOS:000248872600008

In this study, long-term monitoring of a European great lake, Lake Geneva, provides the opportunity to assess to what extent the predicted toxicity of herbicide mixtures explains the changes in the composition of the phytoplankton community next to other classical limnology parameters such as nutrients. To reach this goal, the gradient of the mixture toxicity of 14 herbicides regularly detected in the lake was calculated using concentration addition and response addition models. A temporal gradient of toxicity was observed which decreased from 2004 to 2009. Redundancy analysis and partial redundancy analysis showed that this gradient explains a significant portion of the variation in phytoplankton community composition with and without having removed the effect of all other covariables. Moreover, species that are significantly influenced, positively or negatively, by the decrease of toxicity in the lake over time are highlighted. It can be concluded that the herbicide mixture toxicity is one of the key parameters to explain phytoplankton changes in Lake Geneva.

J	Ho, L; Tang, T; Hoefel, D; Vigneswaran, B				Ho, Lionel; Tang, Tim; Hoefel, Daniel; Vigneswaran, Bala			Determination of rate constants and half-lives for the simultaneous biodegradation of several cyanobacterial metabolites in Australian source waters	WATER RESEARCH												The fate of five cyanobacterial metabolites was assessed in water sourced from Lake Burragorang (Warragamba Dam) in New South Wales, Australia. All of the studied metabolites were shown to be biodegradable in this water source. For some metabolites, biodegradation was influenced by factors, including temperature, location (within the water body) and seasonal variations. The biodegradation of the metabolites was shown to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics with rate constants ranging from 8.0 x 10(-4) to 1.3 x 10(-2) h(-1). Half-lives of the metabolites were also estimated and ranged from 2.2 to 36.1 d. The order of ease of biodegradability in this water source followed the trend: microcystin-LR >= cylindrospermopsin > saxitoxins > geosmin >= 2-methylisoborneol. The lack of detection of the mlrA gene during microcystin biodegradation suggests that these toxins may be degraded via a different pathway. While no metabolite-degrading organisms were isolated in this study, the inoculation of previously isolated geosmin- and microcystin-degrading bacteria into Lake Burragorang water resulted in efficient biodegradation of the respective metabolites. For example, microcystin-degrading isolate TT25 was able to degrade three microcystin variants to concentrations below analytical detection within 24 h, suggesting that inoculation of such bacteria has the potential to enhance biodegradation in Lake Burragorang.

J	Makabe, R; Kurihara, T; Uye, SI				Makabe, Ryosuke; Kurihara, Takuya; Uye, Shin-Ichi			Spatio-temporal distribution and seasonal population dynamics of the jellyfish Aurelia aurita s.l. studied with Dual-frequency IDentification SONar (DIDSON)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Deployment of a Dual-frequency IDentification SONar (DIDSON) revealed the seasonal variations in spatial distribution and abundance of medusae of the common jellyfish, Aurelia aurita s.l. (detectable bell diameters: ca. epsilon 5 cm) in a shallow (max. depth: approximate to 6 m) Japanese brackish-water lake between October 2008 and October 2009. The medusae were usually in patchy aggregations, more prominently so during warm seasons. Integration of the DIDSON-detected medusae with smaller ones estimated from the bell diameter composition in net hauls enabled us to study their seasonal population dynamics. Abundance was highest in June, due to recruitment, and declined to a relatively stable level in August and thereafter. The population carbon biomass was highest in October due to somatic growth of individual medusae. The annual mean biomass (63.8 mg C m(3)) was much higher than that of mesozooplankton (26.0 mg C m(3)), suggesting a substantial top-down impact. The DIDSON is an effective tool for studies of the spatial distribution and population dynamics of large jellyfish species like A. aurita. Concomitant net sampling to determine the bell diameter composition is required to offset the geometric limitations of this instrument.																			0142-7873					NOV	2012	34	11					936	950		10.1093/plankt/fbs057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbs057													WOS:000309467200002
J	Davis, SM; Childers, DL; Lorenz, JJ; Wanless, HR; Hopkins, TE				Davis, SM; Childers, DL; Lorenz, JJ; Wanless, HR; Hopkins, TE			A conceptual model of ecological interactions in the mangrove estuaries of the Florida Everglades	WETLANDS												A brackish water ecotone of coastal bays and lakes, mangrove forests, salt marshes, tidal creeks, and upland hammocks separates Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico from the freshwater Everglades. The Everglades mangrove estuaries are characterized by salinity gradients that vary spatially with topography and vary seasonally and inter-annually with rainfall, tide, and freshwater flow from the Everglades. Because of their location at the lower end of the Everglades drainage basin, Everglades mangrove estuaries have been affected by upstream water management practices that have altered the freshwater heads and flows and that affect salinity gradients. Additionally, interannual variation in precipitation patterns, particularly those caused to El Nino events, control freshwater inputs and salinity dynamics in these estuaries. Two major external drivers on this system are water management activities and global climate change. These drivers lead to two major ecosystem stressors: reduced freshwater flow volume and duration, and sea-level rise. Major ecological attributes include mangrove forest production, soil accretion, and resilience; coastal lake submerged aquatic vegetation; resident mangrove fish populations; wood stork (Mycteria americana) and roseate spoonbill (Platelea ajaja) nesting colonies; and estuarine crocodilian populations. Causal linkages between stressors and attributes include coastal transgression, hydroperiods, salinity gradients, and the "white zone" freshwater/estuarine interface. The functional estuary and its ecological attributes, as influenced by sea level and freshwater flow, must be viewed as spatially dynamic, with a possible near-term balancing of transgression but ultimately a long-term continuation of inland movement. Regardless of the spatio-temporal timing of this transgression, a salinity gradient supportive of ecologically functional Everglades mangrove estuaries will be required to maintain the integrity of the South Florida ecosystem.

In this paper, the major ions and hydrogen and oxygen isotope characteristics of groundwater, lake water, river water, and rain water were analyzed, which were sampled in Dali Lake and its surrounding areas in the dry and wet seasons. The ion ratio method and the end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) based on principal component analysis (PCA) were applied. The causes of the major ions in groundwater during the dry and wet seasons were analyzed. The temporal and spatial recharge sources and characteristics of groundwater were identified and quantified. The hydraulic relation between groundwater and surface water was clarified. The main hydrochemical type of groundwater was Ca-HCO3 with changed to Ca-Mg-Cl type in some areas in the wet seasons. Rock weathering was the main genetic mechanism of groundwater hydrochemistry which mainly from the dissolution of silicate. River water and precipitation were the main sources of groundwater recharge. However, there was a large difference in spatio-temporal distribution and recharge contribution. Gongar River water and precipitation were the main recharge sources of groundwater during the dry season with a contribution rate of 49 % and 48 % respectively. Haolai River water and Liangzi River water together became the main recharge sources of groundwater during the wet season with a contribution rate of between 83 % and 92 %. Rain water covered from 7 % to 13 % of groundwater recharge during the wet season. Overall, compared with river water and precipitation, the contribution of lake water to groundwater recharge was almost negligible, ranging from 0 % to 6 %.

J	Brodsky, L; Vilímek, V; Sobr, M; Kroczek, T				Brodsky, Lukas; Vilimek, Vit; Sobr, Miroslav; Kroczek, Tomas			The Effect of Suspended Particulate Matter on the Supraglacial Lake Depth Retrieval from Optical Data	REMOTE SENSING												Supraglacial lakes (SGL) are a specific phenomenon of glaciers. They are important for ice dynamics, surface mass balance, and surface hydrology, especially during ongoing climate changes. The important characteristics of lakes are their water storage and drainage. Satellite-based remote sensing is commonly used not only to monitor the area but also to estimate the depth and volume of lakes, which is the basis for long-term spatiotemporal analysis of these phenomena. Lake depth retrieval from optical data using a physical model requires several basic assumptions such as, for instance, the water has little or no dissolved or suspended matter. Several authors using these assumptions state that they are also potential weaknesses, which remain unquantified in the literature. The objective of this study is to quantify the effect of maximum detectable lake depth for water with non-zero suspended particulate matter (SPM). We collected in-situ concurrent measurements of hyperspectral and lake depth observations to a depth of 8 m. Additionally, we collected water samples to measure the concentration of SPM. The results of empirical and physically based models proved that a good relationship still exists between the water spectra of SGL and the lake depth in the presence of 48 mg/L of SPM. The root mean squared error for the models ranged from 0.163 m (Partial Least Squares Regression-PLSR model) to 0.243 m (physically based model), which is consistent with the published literature. However, the SPM limited the maximum detectable depth to approximately 3 m. This maximum detectable depth was also confirmed by the theoretical concept of Philpot (1989). The maximum detectable depth decreases exponentially with an increase in the water attenuation coefficient g, which directly depends on the water properties.

Their strong biogeochemical coupling has spurred the use of DOC as a predictor of Hg concentrations and exports in boreal regions where sampling logistics for Hg are costly and complex. Yet relationships between Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) with DOC have recently been shown to be highly variable in terms of slope and strength, suggesting that mechanisms other than co-transport along the land-water continuum may drive the relationship between Hg and DOC across landscapes. In this study, we explore the relationship between Hg and MeHg with DOC across 18 boreal rivers collectively draining over 350,000 km(2) of the eastern James Bay territory (Quebec), comprising watersheds with a wide range of vegetation, water residence time and riverine DOC concentrations and optical properties. Our results show that although a large portion of the variation in Hg and MeHg is explained by concentrations of DOC, Hg-DOC and MeHg-DOC relationships and ratios vary greatly both spatially and temporally. We show that ratios and strength of the coupling can be predicted from system hydrology, with declines in Hg:DOC and increase in MeHg:DOC ratios and stronger coupling during the seasonal progression to warmer temperatures, higher water evaporation, and longer residence time. Our study highlights the role of seasonal hydrology and biogeochemical processing in governing Hg, MeHg and DOC patterns in boreal rivers.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Amyot, Marc/A-7182-2008; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/F-1838-2010	Lapierre, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-5862-7955; Amyot, Marc/0000-0002-0340-3249; Fink-Mercier, Caroline/0000-0003-4195-2991; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2022	58	12							e2022WR033036	10.1029/2022WR033036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033036													WOS:000929798400007

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonium concentration as drivers of nitrification in a protected freshwater lake	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Nitrification rates and ammonia-oxidizer functional gene abundance were measured in the water column of Lake Lacawac, Pennsylvania, USA, a freshwater lake on a nature sanctuary that allowed an investigation with minimal human impacts. Nitrification is a 2-step process consisting of ammonia oxidation followed by nitrite oxidation. Recent studies have shown that these 2 nitrification steps may be uncoupled and respond in different ways to environmental conditions. Additionally, the relative contribution of ammonia-oxidizing archea (AOA) vs ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to nitrification rates varies widely across aquatic systems. To determine how nitrification rates are related to environmental parameters and the ammonia-oxidizing community in a nearly pristine environment, rates and gene abundance were measured over multiple seasons where in-situ environmental conditions varied. Rates of ammonia and nitrite oxidation were measured separately and summed to calculate total nitrification rates ranging from 1 to 568 nM/d. Ammonia oxidation rates generally outpaced nitrite oxidation rates, and rates of both ammonia and nitrite oxidation were higher at depth (10 m) compared with near-surface and mid water column. Ammonia oxidation, nitrite oxidation, and total nitrification rates were all strongly, positively correlated with in-situ [NH4+] (Kendall's tau > 0.35, p < 0.02). AOB ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene copy numbers were generally greater than AOA amoA. However, AOB gene copy numbers were not correlated with any ammonia oxidation or total nitrification rates, whereas AOA abundance was positively correlated with both ammonia oxidation and total nitrification rates (Kendall's tau > 0.41, p < 0.01). A Bayesian generalized additive model, which accounted for sampling month, indicated that total nitrification rates were best explained by AOA and [NH4+]. Thus, substrate concentration and AOA likely play key roles in regulating rates of nitrification in this small, nearly pristine freshwater lake. These reported relationships between rates of ammonia and nitrite oxidation (and, thus, total nitrification), in-situ environmental parameters, and the ammonia-oxidizer community in a protected environment establish a reference for evaluating the impact of a changing environment on mesotrophic lake water quality.

The hydrological connectivity of a river network affects the self-purification capacity and flood prevention capacity of the river. Therefore, an isotope tracer approach was applied to determine the contribution rate of different water bodies to a river network and hydrological connectivity was quantified by introducing the retention rate. Changzhou city was selected as the study area because it is an urbanized city with the characteristics of a plain river network and it is faced with poor hydrological connectivity due to artificial constructions (dams and pumps) and human activity (urbanization). River water, well water (shallow groundwater), lake water and rainfall were collected during the flood season and nonflood season, and hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were determined. The temporal and spatial variations in hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in different water bodies and the state of the water cycle in different water bodies were analysed. IsoSource and MixSIAR models were established to analyse the contribution rate of river network water sources in the study area, and their effectiveness was compared. The results of the MixSIAR model were selected to evaluate the hydrological connectivity of the river network in the study area, providing a method to quantify the hydrological connectivity of specific rivers of the river network in Changzhou city. This method could also be applied to other urban plain river network areas to study river connectivity.					; Li, Chunhui/HHD-3103-2022; wang, xuan/JBJ-6948-2023; bu, jiuhe/JUU-6672-2023	Chunhui, Li/0000-0003-0067-4112; Bu, Jiuhe/0000-0001-5583-211X; Zhang, Shuiling/0000-0002-2255-3461; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				DEC	2022	36	12							e14782	10.1002/hyp.14782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14782													WOS:000903636400001

However, glacial melt processes and their hydrological consequences are very poorly understood. This study collected glacier discharge data from the terminus of the Parlung No. 4 Glacier throughout the melt season (May-October) during 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012 to study its specific hydrological characteristics. Time series and multivariate regression analyses were employed to investigate the relationships between discharge and meteorological factors involved, as well as their correlation to discharge estimations. The 0- to 3-day time series analysis showed that discharge rates were highly autocorrelated and that discharge was significantly positively correlated to air temperature, vapour pressure and daily incoming shortwave radiation as well as weakly positively correlated to precipitation. A multiple-regression exponential model using the independent variables of the daily mean temperature and the vapour pressure exclusively was applied to simulate daily discharge in the basin with a high degree of accuracy. On average, July yielded the maximum monthly mean discharge, followed by August. Discharge in July and August accounted for 53% of the total discharge during the main melt season. The daily cycle of discharge changed as the melt season progressed, reflecting hydrological processes and characteristics of snow melt and glacier ice/snow melt, as well as their transitional periods. Subsequently, regular variations in the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of discharge, storage and delay were observed as the melt season progressed. In addition, the reasons behind the inter-annual variation in the characteristics of discharge and glacier discharge from the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas are compared and discussed.

J	Soares, MCS; Huszar, VLM; Roland, F				Soares, Maria Carolina S.; Huszar, Vera L. M.; Roland, Fabio			Phytoplankton dynamics in two tropical rivers with different degrees of human impact (southeast Brazil)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Potamoplankton attracts little research attention worldwide and this also holds true in Brazil, despite its numerous river systems. The origin and maintenance of phytoplankton populations in these systems have not been well studied. We analysed biological, physical and chemical parameters of the Paraibuna and Pomba rivers to identify the main driving forces behind temporal and spatial phytoplankton patterns. Both systems are located in the southeast, the most populated region. These rivers are similar in climate and geomorphology, and have become eutrophic due to the increase in the human population of the region, especially in Paraibuna River catchments. Twelve and eleven stations were, respectively, sampled during the dry and rainy seasons in the Paraibuna and Pomba rivers. The seasonal pattern of abiotic and biotic variables was related to the increase in the discharge and dilution caused by the rainy period. However, human influences such as the presence of a reservoir and sewage inflow were important to distinguish the rivers. The phytoplankton community of Paraibuna River was influenced by Chapeu D'Uvas Reservoir, which was dominated by a toxic population of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. Pomba River phytoplankton was typical of the lotic tropical systems. Phytoplankton functional groups in both rivers were those commonly found in turbid and turbulent shallow lakes. Although the functional group approach was originally described for lentic environments, our data support this approach for lotic community patterns.

J	Keitt, TH; Fischer, J				Keitt, Timothy H.; Fischer, Janet			Detection of scale-specific community dynamics using wavelets	ECOLOGY												The response of ecological communities to anthropogenic disturbance is of both scientific and practical interest. Communities where all species respond to disturbance in a similar fashion ( synchrony) will exhibit large fluctuations in total biomass and dramatic changes in ecosystem function. Communities where some species increase in abundance while others decrease after disturbance ( compensation) can maintain total biomass and ecosystem function in the face of anthropogenic change. We examined dynamics of the Little Rock Lake ( Wisconsin, USA) zooplankton community in the context of an experimental pH manipulation conducted in one basin of the lake. A novel application of wavelets was used to partition patterns of synchrony and compensation by time scale. We find interestingly that some time series show both patterns of synchrony and compensation depending on the scale of analysis. Within the unmanipulated basin, we found subtle patterns of synchrony and compensation within the community, largely at a one-year time scale corresponding to seasonal variation. Within the acidified lake basin, dynamics shifted to longer time scales corresponding to the pattern of pH manipulation. Comparisons between pairs of species in different functional groups showed both strong compensatory and synchronous responses to disturbance. The strongest compensatory signal was observed for two species of Daphnia whose life history traits lead to synchrony at annual time scales, but whose differential sensitivity to acidification led to compensation at multiannual time scales. The separation of time scales inherent in the wavelet method greatly facilitated interpretation as patterns resulting from seasonal drivers could be separated from patterns driven by pH manipulation.

Drainage and refill of an Antarctic Peninsula subglacial lake reveal anactive subglacial hydrological network	CRYOSPHERE												The presence of subglacial lakes and subglacial hydrologicalnetworks under the East and West Antarctic ice sheets is now relatively wellunderstood, whilst their influence on ice dynamics is the subject of ongoingresearch. In contrast, little is known about subglacial lakes andhydrological networks under the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet and how theseare influencing glacier behaviour. Here we describe the rapid drainage andslow refill of a subglacial lake under Mars Glacier using remote sensing andaerogeophysics. Results suggest drainage of the subglacial lake occurredprior to 2011, resulting in the collapse of the overlying ice into the newlyformed subglacial cavity. The cavity has been refilling since this time,with peak rates of infilling associated with seasonal surface meltwater activity. Wereview evidence for similar features elsewhere in the Antarctic Peninsulaand discuss whether their appearance marks a threshold shift in glacier thermalregimes and the activation or enhancement of their subglacialhydrological networks by surface meltwater. Collectively, these featuresshow coupling of climate processes and the bed of the region's glaciershighlighting their ongoing vulnerability to climate change.

However, studies on GHG emissions from extracted peatlands after rewetting are limited. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission fluxes were determined using the opaque closed chamber method along water level gradients from littoral zones to the open water body of constructed shallow lakes with different vegetation zones in a nutrient-rich rewetted extracted peatland in Sweden. Vegetation communities and their position relative to water level, together with short-term water level fluctuations, such as inundation events and seasonal droughts, and temperature had a significant impact on CH4 emissions fluxes. During "normal" and "dry" conditions and high soil temperatures, CH4 emissions were highest from Carex spp.-Typha latifolia L. communities. During inundation events with water levels > 30 cm, sites with flooded Graminoids-Scirpus spp.-Carex spp. emitted most CH4. Methane emissions from the water body of the constructed shallow lakes were low during all water level conditions and over the temperature ranges observed. Nitrous oxide emissions contributed little to the emission fluxes from the soil-plant-water systems to the atmosphere, and they were only detectable from the sites with Graminoids. In terms of management, the construction of shallow lakes showed great potential for lowering GHG emission fluxes from nutrient rich peatlands after peat extraction, even though the vegetated shore emitted some N2O and CH4.

Distribution and Ecology of the Alpine Newt Ichthyosaura alpestris (Laurenti, 1768) (Amphibia: Salamandridae) in Bulgaria	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												The Alpine newt khthvosaura alpestris is a glacial relict in Bulgaria, occurring only in several mountainous regions. Results of a long-term herpetological survey in Bulgaria are presented, including from sampling specifically targeting the aquatic phase of I. alpestris. The known ranges of its vertical and geographical distribution are now expanded - it occurs autochthonously in seven mountains (in 42 10 x10 km UTM squares, 22 of which previously unreported). We detected it for the first time in two mountains: Pirin and Karvav Karnak. However, several potentially suitable mountains remain under-sampled. A Maxent model with strong predictive power (test AUC = 0.988) based on 10 uncorrelated variables revealed that about 5% of the territory of the country are potentially suitable as habitats for this species. Elevation is the best predictor in the model, followed by slope, while precipitation seasonality and the potential evapotranspiration signify the importance of the presence of (seasonal) water bodies. khthyosaura alpestris seemingly prefers to breed in natural and semi-natural shallow water bodies with muddy bottom, grassy banks, limited reed/buhush, without fish, near or in forested habitats. The registered relative abundances (0.002-1.183 ind./trap-hour), the estimated instantaneous population densities (0.2-7.1 ind./m(2)) and the sex ratios (from 0.25 male : 1 female to 7.29: 1) vary widely among and within mountains.					; Popgeorgiev, Georgi/JBJ-7187-2023; Kornilev, Yurii/N-7035-2013	Plachiyski, Dimitar/0000-0002-3579-2517; 													0324-0770					MAR	2020	72	1					83	102																WOS:000521828400011

Variations in aquatic macrophyte phenology across three temperate lakes in the Coeur d'Alene Basin	AQUATIC BOTANY												We studied the phenology of submerged macrophytes within three temperate lakes in 2017. Phenology was examined with macrophyte biomass, sonar biovolume, and water quality data. The primary objective was to determine the timing and duration of macrophyte senescence. The secondary objective was to investigate the feasibility of using sonar biovolume to measure seasonal changes in macrophytes. Our results indicated that Black and Thompson lakes had longer growing seasons and higher species richness than Chatcolet Lake likely due to differences in hydrologic connectivity. Macrophyte senescence was more distinct in Black and Chatcolet lakes. The prolonged and indistinct senescence at Thompson Lake was likely due to the dominance of the macrophyte community by Myriophyllum spicatum. Biovolume results revealed complex spatial patterns in macrophyte senescence at Chatcolet Lake. Macrophyte biovolume was positively correlated with biomass at all sites. Spearman's rank correlation was highest at Chatcolet Lake (rho = 0.75, p-value < 0.001) followed by Black Lake (rho = 0.59, p-value < 0.001) and Thompson Lake (rho = 0.49, p-value < 0.001). The relationship between biovolume and biomass is likely non-linear and variation in the relationship can be attributed to site specific differences such as species composition in addition to sampling error. Sonar biovolume provided a convenient and nondestructive way to measure seasonal changes in macrophytes.					; Scofield, Ben/AHB-7276-2022	Scofield, Ben/0000-0002-1000-1555; Chess, Dale/0000-0001-7061-5578													0304-3770	1879-1522				MAR	2020	162								103209	10.1016/j.aquabot.2020.103209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2020.103209													WOS:000518589600010

JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												In palynology and other laboratory-based disciplines, methodological literature often lags the development and adoption of new practices. Here we highlight the lack of literature on the application of heavy liquid density separation for pollen preparations, a technique that has become common practice in recent years. In a study of Holocene-age sediments from Lake Pupuke, northern New Zealand, we found that the density of the heavy liquid used to separate pollen from the minerogenic fraction, within the range of reported practice, affected pollen counts. When a relatively low density was used (2.0 g/cm(3)), buoyant pollen grains such as Prumnopitys taxifolia and Dacrydium cupressinum were overrepresented, whereas small, compact pollen grains such as Libocedrus and Metrosideros were underrepresented. This result raises wider concerns, as heavy liquid densities reported in the literature range from 1.88 to 2.40 g/cm(3). We draw attention to this problem and recommend steps that palynologists can take to ensure that their enumerated pollen assemblages are representative and do not lead to spurious interpretations.

In this paper we synthesised the results of different modern analogue studies performed in a varved lake. We discuss their potential value to obtain best results from high resolution past records. Different biogeochemical contemporary processes revealed seasonality and year-to-year variability, e.g., calcite precipitation, lake oxygenation, production and deposition of pollen and phytoplankton growth. Fingerprints of the first two of these processes were clearly evidenced in the varve-sublayers and allow understanding related to past events. Pollen studies suggested the possibility of identifying and characterizing seasonal layers even in the absence of varves. Marker pigments in the water column were tightly associated with phytoplankton groups living today; most of them were identified in the sediment record as well. We observed that 50% of these marker pigments were destroyed between deposition and permanent burying. In another study, seasonality in the production/distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and derived temperature estimates were investigated in catchment soils and particles settling in the lake. The signatures of brGDGTs in depositional environments mainly were representative of stable conditions of soils in the catchment that last over decades; no brGDGTs seemed to be produced within the lake. The main contribution of this review is to show the advantages and limitations of a multiproxy modern-analogue approach in Lake Montcortes as a case study and proposing new working hypotheses for future research.

Stable empirical Green's functions (EGFs) were extracted from ambient noise correlations between the two arrays. The EGFs have three distinct envelopes which correspond to the head waves, direct waves, and surface-reflected waves. The arrival time of the head wave was almost constant with season. Corresponding simulations were carried out, and implied that the relatively small penetration depth of heat flow is the main reason for the seasonally-invariant head wave speed.

J	Arp, G; Reimer, A; Reitner, J				Arp, G; Reimer, A; Reitner, J			Microbialite formation in seawater of increased alkalinity, Satonda crater lake, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												The crater lake of the small volcanic island Satonda, Indonesia, is unique for its red-algal microbial reefs thriving in marine-derived water of increased alkalinity. The lake is a potential analogue for ancient oceans sustaining microbialites under open-marine conditions. Current reef surfaces are dominated by living red algae covered by non-calcified biofilms with scattered cyanobacteria and diatoms. Minor CaCO3 precipitates are restricted to the seasonally flooded reef tops, which develop biofilms up to 500 mum thick dominated by the cyanobacteria Pleurocapsa, Calothrix, Phormidium, and Hyella. Microcrystalline aragonite patches form within the biofilm mucilage, and fibrous aragonite cements grow in exopolymer-poor spaces such as the inside of dead, lysed green algal cells, and reef framework voids. Cementation of lysed hadromerid sponge resting bodies results in the formation of "Wetheredella-like" structures. Hydrochemistry data and model calculations indicate that CO2 degassing after seasonal mixis can shift the carbonate equilibrium to cause CaCO3 precipitation. Increased concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon limit the ability of autotrophic biofilm microorganisms to shift the carbonate equilibrium. Therefore, photosynthesis-induced cyanobacterial calcification does not occur. Instead, passive, diffusion-controlled EPS-mediated permineralization of biofilm mucus at contact with the considerably supersaturated open lake water takes place. In contrast to extreme soda lakes, the release of Ca2+ from aerobic degradation of extracellular polymeric substances does not support CaCO3 precipitation in Satonda because the simultaneously released CO2 is insufficiently buffered. Subfossil reef parts comprise green algal tufts encrusted by micro-stromatolites with layers of fibrous aragonite and an amorphous, unidentified Mg-Si phase. The microstromatolites probably formed when Lake Satonda evolved from seawater to Ca2+-depleted raised-alkalinity conditions because of sulfate reduction in bottom sediments and pronounced seasonality with deep mixing events and strong CO2 degassing. The latter effect caused rapid growth of fibrous aragonite, while Mg-Si layers replaced the initially Mg-calcite-impregnated biofilms. This could be explained by dissolution of siliceous diatoms and sponge spicules at high pH, followed by Mg-calcite dissolution and Mg-silica precipitation at low pH due to heterotrophic activity within the entombed biofilms.

Infection level of monogenean gill parasite, Diplozoon kashmirensis (Monogenea, Polyopisthocotylea) in the Crucian Carp, Carassius carassius from lake ecosystems of an altered water quality: What factors do have an impact on the Diplozoon infection?	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												Monogeneans are of great interest to the ecologists because of their simple life cycle and are considered as one of the important and sensitive parasites to any changes in water quality. The monogenean gill parasite, Diplozoon kashmirensis of the Carassius carassius was examined with the aim to evaluate the infection level and the factors influencing the infection. Our results showed that highest prevalence (34.22%) of D. kashmirensis was in the lake having high trophic status and least prevalence (10.90%) in the lake having least trophic status. Infection levels were significantly higher at the basins/sites having deteriorated water quality in comparison to the basins/sites having better water quality. The combined effect of pollutants and eutrophication showed decrease in intensity of D. kashmirensis in one of the polluted/hypertrophied site in the hypertrophic lake (Anchar Lake), while as synergistic effect (i.e. increase) on prevalence and intensity was observed in one of the polluted/hypertrophied site in the eutrophic lake (Dal Lake). Sex was not an important factor influencing the D. kashmirensis in three lakes. The study showed that condition factor was significantly higher in the hypertrophic lake and in an uninfected fish. In addition microhabitat influenced the Diplozoon infection. Most preferable site for the D. kashmirensis was middle sector of the gill. Furthermore, the gill parasite showed significantly positive correlation (r(p) = 0.6, P < 0.05) with water temperature in the hypertrophic lake, thus showing the impact of water temperature on this parasite. It was concluded that intra lake differences, season, condition factor, microhabitat and water temperature influenced the infection of D. kashmirensis. It seems from the data that eutrophic and hypertrophic habitats were favourable for the D. kashmirensis. The D. kashmirensis showed both antagonistic and synergistic response to the combined effect of pollution and eutrophication. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cooper, R; Hodgkins, R; Wadham, J; Tranter, M				Cooper, Richard; Hodgkins, Richard; Wadham, Jemma; Tranter, Martyn			The hydrology of the proglacial zone of a high-Arctic glacier(Finsterwalderbreen, Svalbard): Sub-surface water fluxes and complete water budget	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Proglacial areas receive fluxes of glacial meltwater in addition to their own hydrological inputs and outputs, while in high latitudes the seasonal development of the active layer also affects their hydrology. This paper supplements a previous study of the surface and atmospheric water fluxes in the proglacial area of the Svalbard glacier Finsterwalderbreen (77 degrees N), by focusing on the sub-surface water fluxes of the active layer, and bringing together all the components of the proglacial water balance over a complete annual cycle. Particular attention is given to the transitional zone between the moraine complex and the flat sandur. Sub-surface water in the moraine complex (sourced mainly from snowmelt, lake drainage and active-layer thawing), is exchanged with sub-surface water from the sandur (sourced mainly from glacier-derived snow- and ice-melt), across a largely distinct boundary. Hydraulic head and specific discharge were monitored in a transect of wells spanning this boundary. A hydraulic gradient from the moraine complex to the sandur is maintained throughout the melt season, although this is reversed first briefly when glacial runoff floods the sandur, and then diurnally from mid-melt-season, as peak daily flow in the proglacial channel network drives sub-surface water in the sandur towards the moraine complex. It is estimated that the active layer does not freeze up until mid-December at this location, so that sub-surface water flow may be maintained for months after the cessation of surface runoff. However, the magnitude of sub-surface flow is very small: the total, annual flux from the moraine complex to the sandur is 11 mm, compared with 1073 mm of total, annual runoff from the whole catchment (glacier included). Furthermore, when considering the water balance of the entire proglacial area, there are unlikely to be significant, seasonal storage changes in the active layer. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of fisheries management on fish communities in the floodplain lakes of a Brazilian Amazonian Reserve	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We compared fish abundance, diversity and species composition between lakes open (fished) and closed (no-take) to fishing activities in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve in the Central Brazilian Amazon, in order to investigate potential influences of the common-based management. We sampled 1483 fishes from 70 species through gillnet fishing during the low-water season, in seven fished and seven no-take lakes. Contrary to expected, the mean values for abundance, size, diversity and species-richness of fish did not differ between fished and no-take lakes. There was no difference between fished and no-take lakes considering only the abundance of the 14 fish species more intensely targeted by fishermen. However, the abundance of an important commercial fish, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) was higher in no-take lakes. Such data from a rapid assessment may be useful to monitor this and other fishery co-management schemes.

Habitat selection and movements of Piping Plover broods suggest a tradeoff between breeding stages	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												In precocial birds, adults select breeding areas using cues associated with habitat characteristics that are favorable for nesting success and chick survival, but there may be tradeoffs in habitat selection between these breeding stages. Here we describe habitat selection and intra-territory movements of 53 Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) broods (320 observations) during the 2007-2008 breeding seasons on mainland- and island-shoreline habitats at Lake Sakakawea, North Dakota, USA. We used remotely sensed habitat characteristics to separately examine habitat selection and movements at two spatiotemporal scales to account for potential confounding effects of nest-site selection on brood-rearing habitat used. The scales used were (1) the entire brood-rearing period within available brood-rearing areas and (2) 2-day observation intervals within age-specific discrete habitat selection choice sets. Analyses at both scales indicated that broods selected areas which were non-vegetated, moderately level, and nearer to the shoreline. Rate of brood movement increased with age up to 5 days, then stabilized; broods that hatched > 50 m away from the shoreline moved toward the shoreline. Brood movements were greater when they were in vegetated areas, when the brood-rearing area was of greater topographic complexity, and when broods aged 6-25 days were further away from the shoreline. Using inferences from our results and those of previously published work, we postulate how a potential tradeoff in habitat selection between nesting and brood-rearing can contribute to an ecological trap in a novel habitat. This work, in the context of published works, suggests that plover breeding habitat is a complex of both nesting and brood-rearing habitats and provides a basis for making remotely sensed abundance estimates of suitable breeding habitat for Piping Plovers.

A model ensemble for simulating plankton community dynamics in Lake Kinneret (Israel) from 1988 to 1999 has been induced from electronically-measurable predictor variables (EMPV) such as water temperature, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. It cascade wise predicts the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratios TN/TP, concentrations of chlorophyta, baccilariophyta, cyanophyta and dinophyta, as well as densities of rotifera, cladocera and copepoda solely from EMPV. The best coefficients of determination (r(2)) have been achieved with 0.6 by the dinophyta model, 0.45 by the rotifera model and 0.44 by the bacillariophyta model. The worst coefficients of determination (r(2)) have been produced by the cladocera model with 0.24 and by the TN/TP model with 0.28. Despite the differences in the r(2) values and apart from the cladocera model, the remaining models matched reasonably well seasonal and interannual plankton dynamics observed over 11 years in Lake Kinneret. The model ensemble developed by HEA also revealed ecological thresholds and relationships determining plankton community dynamics in Lake Kinneret solely based on in situ predictor variables.

J	Hondorp, DW; Pothoven, SA; Brandt, SB				Hondorp, DW; Pothoven, SA; Brandt, SB			Influence of Diporeia density on diet composition, relative abundance, and energy density of planktivorous fishes in southeast Lake Michigan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. is an important prey for many fish in offshore areas of the Great Lakes, but its abundance has been rapidly decreasing. To assess the influence of Diporeia availability on the food habits, relative abundance, and energetics of planktivorous fish, the diet composition, catch per unit effort (CPUE), and energy density of plantkivorous fish in southeast Lake Michigan during 2000-2001 were compared among locations with different Diporeia densities. Diporeia densities at St. Joseph, Michigan, were near 0/m(2) over much of the bottom but averaged more than 3,800/m(2) at Muskegon and Little Sable Point, Michigan. Consistent with these differences in Diporeia density, fish diet composition, CPUE, and energy density varied spatially. For example, alternative prey types comprised a larger fraction of the diets of bloater Coregonus hoyi, large (> 100 mm total length) alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, and slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus at St. Joseph than at Muskegon and Little Sable Point. This pattern was seasonally dependent for alewives and bloaters because Diporeia were eaten mainly in June. Food biomass per stomach was not lower at St. Joseph than elsewhere, suggesting that the spatial variation in diet composition was due to greater consumption of alternative prey by fish at St. Joseph. Although slimy sculpin and bloaters were able to feed on alternative prey, the CPUE of these species at certain depths was considerably lower at St. Joseph than at Muskegon or Little Sable Point, indicating that Diporeia availability may also influence fish abundance and distribution. Finally, a link between Diporeia density and fish energetics was suggested by the comparatively low energy density of deepwater sculpin Myoxocephalus thompsonii and large alewives at St. Joseph, a result that may reflect the low energy content of other prey relative to Diporeia.

The full operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on the main stream of the Yangtze River has caused substantial changes in the relationship between the river and the lake, and the hydrological and hydrodynamic regime of Poyang Lake have also shown obvious variations in response. This study constructed a 2D hydrodynamic model of Poyang Lake based on GPU acceleration to realize a long-term simulation of the water flow evolution of Poyang Lake. By comparing the differences in water level at Hukou station between 20-year periods before and after TGD construction, the impact of TGD construction on Poyang Lake was characterized. Results showed that in comparison with the values for the pre-dam period, the water level of Poyang Lake decreased by 0.4-2.0 m and the flow velocity increased by 0.01-0.04 m/s in the post- dam period, and both showed a trend of reduction spatially from the north toward the south. Additionally, the inundation area of the lake decreased by 9 %, the 10-m characteristic water level at Xingzi station advanced by 27 days, the duration of low water extended by 37 days, and in typical dry, normal, and wet years, the time of occurrence of low water advanced. Moreover, TGD construction has aggravated the conditions of Poyang Lake in the dry season. The findings of this study are of great importance in relation to refining the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of habitats, and supporting further investigation of the changes in the aquatic ecosystem of Poyang Lake under TGD regulation.					yang, xiyan/MXL-3426-2025; 邓, 华堂/JJG-0096-2023														0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2025	646								132302	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132302		NOV 2024											WOS:001360195700001

Ultrasonic transmitters were successfully implanted in 15 sexually mature adult fish during spawning periods in 19971999. Telemetry data, along with GIS software, were used to determine where Lake Sturgeon resided in Lake St. Clair following implantation. Movement information collected from tagged Lake Sturgeon from May 1997October 2000 revealed three patterns. Following implantation, 73% of the fish (four females and seven males) moved downstream from the St. Clair River to Lake St. Clair, 13% of the fish (one female and one male) were presumed to have moved upriver to Lake Huron, and 20% of the fish (one female and two males) remained in or returned to the St. Clair River for at least 1 year. The fish that moved into Lake St. Clair were found most often in an area near the St. Clair River Delta, at depths of 46 m (>98% of observations). Fish that remained in the St. Clair River were commonly found (>84%) at depths between 9 and 18 m. Four females and three males returned to the spawning site in the St. Clair River in subsequent spawning seasons. Females returned at intervals of 13 years and males at 12 years. For all invertebrates tested, only Ephemeroptera density was a significant predictor of Lake Sturgeon presence/absence in Lake St. Clair.																			0175-8659					NOV	2011	27			2	SI		58	65		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01827.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01827.x													WOS:000297848300009

Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality. Stable conditions, caused by low connectivity in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were associated to elevated richness and diversity values, caused by exchange biota due to higher connectivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The results revealed 147 species from 58 genera and 7 phyla of phytoplankton and 84 species from 56 genera and 4 phyla of zooplankton in Dongting Lake. The characteristics of plankton communities varied with time and space. The temporal variation of phytoplankton abundance ranged from 43.5201 x 104 to 120.7968 x 104 cells/L and the spatial variation ranged from 18.6707 x 104 to 247.5542 x 104 cells/L. The temporal variation of zooplankton abundance ranged from 18 to 42 ind/L and the spatial variation ranged from 19 to 62 ind/L. The temporal and spatial variations of the abundance range values were much larger for phytoplankton than for zooplankton, with phytoplankton dominating. However, environmental factors in Dongting Lake vary more temporally than spatially, and drive more temporal than spatial variations in planktonic organisms. Based on the redundancy analysis WT, DO, and CODMn were the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of phytoplankton, while WT, CODMn, NO2-N, and Chl-a were the main factors affecting the distribution of zooplankton. WT and CODMn were the common key influencing factors.

Efforts have been devoted to developing novel algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a), cyno-blooms, and floating vegetation. However, to this date, little research has focused on freshwater lakes in the data-scarce Sub-Saharan African countries such as Malawi. We, therefore, estimated the trophic status of Lake Malombe in Malawi-a lake likely to be affected by eutrophication and algal bloom-emerging threats to freshwater ecosystem functioning globally-especially with the onset of climatic and anthropogenic drivers. We integrated in situ data with high-resolution Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery Analysis (MSI). We independently assessed the remote sensing technique using in situ data and tested the model at multiple stages. The scatter plot showed that most points were in the 95% confidence interval. The validation results between the measured in situ chl-a concentrations and the Sentinel-2 MSI-based chl-a retrieval had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.88 mu g/L. The chl-a concentrations retrieved from MSI images were consistent with in situ data, indicating that the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) algorithm estimated chl-a concentrations in Lake Malombe with acceptable accuracy. Dissolved oxygen (DO), sulfate (SO42-), nitrite (NO2-), soluble reactive phosphorous (PO43-), total dissolved solids (TDS), and chl- a, except for temperatures from the hot-dry-season, cold-dry-windy-season, and rainy-season, were significantly different (P < 0.05). The Sentinel-2 MSI imagery analysis also depicted similar results, with high chl-a concentration reported in March (rainy season) and October (hot-dry season) and the lowest from May to August (cold-dry-windy season). On the contrary, the ANOVA results for water quality parameters from all five points had P > 0.05. The correlation matrix showed coefficients of (0.798 < r < 0.930, n = 30, P < 0.005), suggesting that Lake Malombe is homogenous. Our results demonstrate that integrating remote sensing based on MSI imagery and in situ data to estimate chl-a can provide an effective tool for monitoring eutrophication in small, medium, and large standing waterbodies-crucial information required to respond to global ecological and climatic dynamics.					; MAKWINJA, RODGERS/AAM-5741-2020; MAKWINJA, `RODGERS/AAM-5741-2020; Haaziyu, Wendy/NGQ-6481-2025; Sagawa, Tatsuyuki/LTD-9493-2024	Obubu, John Peter/0000-0003-2159-7398; Inagaki, Yoshihiko/0000-0003-2020-9787; MAKWINJA, `RODGERS/0000-0002-0818-4727; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2023	30	11					29755	29772		10.1007/s11356-022-24288-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-24288-8		NOV 2022						36418816					WOS:000886894200013

Recovery of viable cyanophages from the sediments of a eutrophic lake at decadal timescales	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Cyanobacteria and their associated viruses (cyanophages) are abundant throughout the world in both marine and freshwater environments. The predatorprey relationship influences population dynamics within these ecosystems and facilitates the co-evolution of both organisms. Evidence of the close-linked interactions between cyanobacteria and viruses has been found extensively throughout marine biomes, but freshwater systems are less well studied. Eutrophic lake sediments potentially allow the preservation of cyanophages. If historic cyanophages could be isolated, they could provide insights into the evolution, biology and population dynamics over defined timescales. To determine whether viable phages are present in this environment, sectioned sediment cores ( 50 cm in length) were taken from a eutrophic, stratifying lake (Rostherne Mere, Cheshire, UK). They were examined under the transmission electron microscope, and phages were isolated on two Microcystis strains PCC 7820 and BC 84/1. Viable phages were recovered from 33- and 50-year-old sediments. This is the first known study to investigate the viability of freshwater cyanophages recovered from dated lake sediments.

Energy balance and evaporation loss of an agricultural reservoir in a semi-arid climate (south-eastern Spain)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A typical agricultural water reservoir (AWR) of 2400 m(2) area and 5 m depth, located in a semi-arid area (southern Spain), was surveyed on a daily basis for 1 year. The annual evaporation flux was 102.7 W m(-2), equivalent to an evaporated water depth of 1310 mm year(-1). The heat storage rate G exhibited a clear annual cycle with a peak gain in April (G similar to 45 W m(-2)) and a peak loss in November (G similar to 40 W m(-2)), leading to a marked annual hysteretic trend when evaporation (lambda E) was related to net radiation (R-n). lambda E was strongly correlated with the available energy A, representing 91% of the annual AWR energy loss. The sensible heat flux H accounted for the remaining 9%, leading to an annual Bowen ratio in the order of 0.10. The equilibrium and advective evaporation terms of the Penman formula represented 76 and 24%, respectively, of the total evaporation, corresponding to a annual value of the Priestley-Taylor (P-T) coefficient (alpha) of 1.32. The P-T coefficient presented a clear seasonal pattern, with a minimum of 1.23 ( July) and a maximum of 1.65 (December), indicating that, during periods of limited available energy, AWR evaporation increased above the potential evaporation as a result of the advection process. Overall, the results stressed that accurate prediction of monthly evaporation by means of the P-T formula requires accounting for both the annual cycle of storage and the advective component. Some alternative approaches to estimating R-n, G and alpha are proposed and discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Eradicating the invasive topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva, from a recreational fishery in northern England	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												An established population of the invasive topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva (Temminck & Schlegel), was discovered in a recreational fishery in Northwest England in 2002. As the lake was seasonally connected to a river catchment, providing potential for dispersal, a containment and eradication programme was initiated. Containment involved screening of outfalls and preventing fish movements off site. Eradication involved the fishery being treated twice with a rotenone-based piscicide, in March and April 2005. The mean P. parva density prior to rotenone application was 6.1 m(-2); following the application, none were recorded. Non-target species in the fishery were removed prior to the application; following rotenone degradation, they were re-introduced and subsequently spawned, with recording of young-of-the-year. This contrasts with 2004 when only young-of-the-year of P. parva were recorded. As the eradication appeared to be successful, the method is considered suitable for use on other populations posing a similar threat of dispersal of the species into rivers and on other invasive fish populations in undesirable locations.

The challenge lies in finding alternative heating systems and repurposing existing infrastructures, like gas pipes. This article presents a new approach to supplying energy to heat pumps in a post-natural gas era using repurposed gas pipes to transport water for ice-source heat pumps. It highlights the advantages of ice-source heat pumps and compares their thermal performance with other types. The proposed system integrates ice-source and geothermal heat pumps, offering space efficiency, compact design, cost-effective centralization, optimized subsidies, seasonal cooling, weather resilience, and eliminates the need for new piping. This study evaluates heat pump efficiency using various low-grade heat sources: ambient air, ground, domestic wastewater, river and lake water, piped water, and latent heat. It focuses on optimizing heat pump performance under the UK's climatic conditions, addressing efficiency challenges during peak cold periods. The research demonstrates the system's robust performance in cold, densely populated areas, potentially reducing water mass for energy supply by up to 95 % with a 70 % ice slurry concentration. Additionally, the ice-source heat pump requires about 36.7 times less water volume than traditional systems for residential heating.						mehdipour, ramin/0000-0003-1343-9728													0960-1481	1879-0682				DEC	2024	237		C						121867	10.1016/j.renene.2024.121867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2024.121867		NOV 2024											WOS:001358502100001

M.; Izdori, Fides			Future Changes in Climate Extremes: Insights from CMIP6 Model Simulations for the Kagera River Sub-basin, Tanzania	EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												This study assesses future changes in the extreme climate regime of the Kagera River sub-basin in Tanzania using multi-model ensembles (MMEs) derived from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Global Climate Models (GCMs). Four climate scenarios were considered: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, for three future periods: 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100. Eight indices from the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), along with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), were used to analyze future changes in temperature and precipitation extremes, as well as drought patterns. The results indicate that monthly and seasonal rainfall will potentially increase by up to 123% and 55%, respectively. The consecutive dry days (CDD) and the number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm) are expected to decrease by up to 133% and 41%, respectively. In contrast, the average precipitation intensity on wet days (SDII) could rise by up to 57%, while maximum one-day precipitation (Rx1day) may increase by up to 127%. Spatial variability in extreme precipitation changes across the sub-basin was also evident. The SPI indicates mixed patterns in the frequency of severe drought events, but no periods of consecutive severe drought years were indicated. Additionally, the results suggest increases in temperature extremes, with the annual maximum and minimum values of daily maximum (TXx, TXn) and daily minimum temperatures (TNx, TNn) all expected to rise in the future. These findings are critical for informing adaptation strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change in the Kagera sub-basin and the broader Lake Victoria region.					; Mulungu, Deogratias/ABC-8552-2020	Tibangayuka, Nickson/0000-0002-3207-4632; Mulungu, Deogratias/0000-0003-2283-9918; , Fides/0000-0001-8706-037X													2509-9426	2509-9434				2024 NOV 13	2024										10.1007/s41748-024-00519-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41748-024-00519-5		NOV 2024											WOS:001353814900001

While terrestrial studies have treated synchrony mainly as a population-level concept, the majority of freshwater studies have focused on community-level patterns, particularly in lake planktonic communities. We used spatially and temporally hierarchical data on benthic stream invertebrates across six years, with three seasonal samples a year, in 11 boreal streams to assess temporal coherence at three spatial extents: 1) among regions (watersheds), 2) among streams within a region, and 3) among riffles within a stream, using the average of correlation coefficients for stream/riffle pairs across years. Our results revealed the primacy of strongly synchronized climatic factors (precipitation, air temperature) in inducing temporal coherence of macroinvertebrate assemblages across geographically distinct sites (i.e. Moran effect). Coherence tended to decrease with increasing spatial extent, but positive coherence was detected for most biological variables even at the largest extent (about 350 km). The generally high level of coherence reflected the strong seasonality of boreal freshwater communities. A hydrologically exceptional year enhanced the synchrony of biological variables, particularly total macroinvertebrate abundance. Regionally low precipitation in that year led to a substantial decrease in benthic densities across a broad spatial extent, followed by a rapid post-drought recovery. Coherence at the among-riffle (within-stream) extent was lower than expected, implying that local-scale habitat filters determine community dynamics at smaller spatial extents. Thus, temporal coherence of stream benthic communities appears to be controlled by partly different processes at different spatial scales.					; Huttunen, Kaisa-Leena/OLR-0348-2025; Muotka, Timo/JED-5466-2023	Huttunen, Kaisa-Leena/0000-0003-0488-1274; 													0906-7590	1600-0587				JUN	2014	37	6					599	608		10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00325.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00325.x													WOS:000337694100010

Quantification and genetic diversity of total and microcystin-producing Microcystis during blooming season in Tai and Yang-cheng lakes, China	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: The aims of present study were to evaluate the abundances, genetic diversity of total and microcystin-producing Microcystis over temporal and spatial scales, and to investigate relationships among Microcystis and water parameters in Tai and Yang-cheng lakes. Methods and Results: Abundances of total and microcystin-producing Microcystis varied across sampling periods and locations, which were assessed using qPCR with primers specific to Microcystis 16S rDNA and mcyA genes. The 16S rDNA from two lakes were relatively diverse. However, mcyA genes were rather conservative and were >97% identical to reference sequences. The highly positive correlations between mcyA and microcystin presence (r=0 center dot 671 in Tai; r=0 center dot 799 in Yang-cheng) suggested that mcyA can be used as a good biomarker for microcystin productions. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that Microcystis were genetically diverse between these conjunctive lakes; however, mcyA genes were relatively conservative in two lakes. Quantifying mcyA by qPCR was an efficient tool for monitoring toxic Microcystis. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study has improved our understanding of observable differences within and between each lake on spatial and temporal scales. And the discovery of new mcyA sequences in natural water enriched the understanding of phylogenetic diversity of Microcystis and toxin-production-related mcy gene.																			1364-5072	1365-2672				JUN	2014	116	6					1482	1494		10.1111/jam.12456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.12456								24471490					WOS:000335983700011

Ecological controls on net ecosystem productivity of a mesic arctic tundra under current and future climates	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Changes in arctic C stocks with climate are thought to be caused by rising net primary productivity (NPP) during longer and warmer growing seasons, offset by rising heterotrophic respiration (Rh) in warmer and deeper soil active layers. In this study, we used the process model ecosys to test hypotheses for these changes with CO2 and energy fluxes measured by eddy covariance over a mesic shrub tundra at Daring Lake, Canada, under varying growing seasons. These tests corroborated substantial rises in NPP, smaller rises in Rh, and, hence, rises in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) from 17 to 45 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (net C sink), modeled with higher T-a and longer growing seasons. However, NEP was found to decline briefly during midsummer warming events (T-a > 20 degrees C). A model run under climate change predicted for Daring Lake indicated that rises in NPP would exceed those in Rh during the first 100 years, causing NEP to rise. Rises in NPP were driven by more rapid net N mineralization from more rapid Rh in warming soils. However, greater declines in NEP were modeled during more frequent and intense midsummer warming events as climate change progressed. Consequently, average annual NEP (+/- interannual variability) rose from 30 (+/- 13) g C m(-2) yr(-1) under current climate to 57 (+/- 40) g C m(-2) yr(-1) after 90 years but declined to 44 (+/- 51) g C m-2 yr(-1) after 150 years, indicating that gains in tundra NEP under climate change may not be indefinite.					; Dimitrov, Dimitre/NOF-1362-2025	Humphreys, Elyn/0000-0002-5397-2802; Grant, Robert/0000-0002-8890-6231													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR 18	2011	116								G01031	10.1029/2010JG001555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JG001555													WOS:000288607000002
J	Shen, S; Shimizu, Y				Shen, Shang; Shimizu, Yoshihisa			Seasonal Variation in Viral Infection Rates and Cell Sizes of Infected Prokaryotes in a Large and Deep Freshwater Lake (Lake Biwa, Japan)	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												As viruses regulate prokaryotic abundance and the carbon cycle by infecting and lysing their prokaryotic hosts, the volume of infected prokaryotes is an important parameter for understanding the impact of viruses on aquatic environments. However, literature regarding the seasonal and spatial variations in the cell volume of infected prokaryotes is limited, despite the volume of the prokaryotic community varying dynamically with season and water column depth. Here, we conducted a field survey for two annual cycles in a large and deep freshwater lake (Lake Biwa, Japan), where large prokaryotes inhabit the deeper layer during the stratified period. We used transmission electron microscopy to reveal the seasonal and spatial variation in the frequency of viral infection and cell volume of infected prokaryotes. We found that the viral infection rate in the surface layer increased when estimated contact rates increased during the middle of the stratified period, whereas the infection rate in the deeper layer increased despite low estimated contact rates during the end of the stratified period. In addition, in the deeper layer, the fraction of large prokaryotes in the total and infected prokaryotic communities increased progressively while the number of intracellular viral particles increased. We suggest different ways in which the viral abundance is maintained in the two water layers. In the surface layer, it is speculated that viral abundance is supported by the high viral infection rate because of the high activity of prokaryotes, whereas in the deeper layer, it might be supported by the larger number of intracellular viral particles released from large prokaryotes. Moreover, large prokaryotes could contribute as important sources of organic substrates via viral lysis in the deeper layer, where labile dissolved organic matter is depleted.

Red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) fire history and management implications in the Mississippi River headwaters, Minnesota, USA	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We used dendrochronological methods and remnant fire-scarred red pines (Pinus resinosa Ait.) to reconstruct historical fire regime characteristics and relate these findings to past climate, human land use changes, and vegetation for a landscape in northern Minnesota, USA. A total of 314 fire scars were dated, representing 56 unique fire events from 1565 to 1967. In the period prior to fire exclusion (1535-1935), fire intervals ranged from 1 to 40 years across the landscape and the mean fire interval was 6.6 years. The majority of fire scars (74%) occurred in the dormant season. Climate analyses showed that conditions two years before fire events were significantly wet and, in the year of fires, conditions were significantly dry. Overall, our study reveals complex interactions among climate, humans, and physiographic factors and how these have varied through time. For fire and forest management of red pine specifically, the results point to the use of silvicultural systems with high levels of retention, including non-stand replacing disturbances.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				AUG 15	2021	494								119313	10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119313	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119313		MAY 2021											WOS:000657598600006

REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING OF SAPPHIRE-BEARING MARBLE FROM THE BELUGA OCCURRENCE, BAFFIN ISLAND, NUNAVUT	CANADIAN MINERALOGIST												Baffin Island (Nunavut, Canada) is located in the remote arctic where geological exposure is high, terrain is expansive, and field seasons are short. Metacarbonates in the Lake Harbour Group, southern Baffin Island, are considered to be prospective for sapphire (corundum), lapis lazuli (lazurite), and spinel gem deposits. This research is an investigation of the hyperspectral signature of rocks from the Beluga sapphire occurrence near Kimmirut, Nunavut. Thirty-five rock and thin section offcut samples from the Beluga corundum occurrence were studied in a laboratory setting using high spatial resolution imaging spectroscopy in the shortwave infrared region (SWIR, similar to 975 to 2500 nm). Analysis of hyperspectral imagery successfully reproduced mineralogical and textural information relevant to gem mineralization previously assessed through thin section petrography and scanning electron microscopy. Scapolite, phlogopite, and muscovite from these rocks are shown to have distinct spectral responses from the host marble that is dominated by calcite. Furthermore, spectrally distinct prehnite and zeolite, both locally associated with corundum mineralization, are readily distinguishable. From the perspective of regional exploration, the small footprint of colored gemstone deposits in combination with their unique mineralogical makeup, unusual settings, and unfamiliarity to most geoscientists has resulted in very few discoveries in this remote but otherwise fertile area. These factors, in combination with the unique spectral responses observed from hand samples and thin section offcuts, provide a positive case for mapping and exploration of gem corundum targets by high spatial resolution hyperspectral imaging as part of regional surveys.

Specimens were captured between October 2011 and September 2012 in the main channel of the river and in adjacent lakes in the municipality of Barcelos, AM, Brazil. Six growth checks were identified on the scales of specimens. The annual variation in body condition observed suggests that fat is accumulated during the dry season. Results for the GSI (gonadosomatic index) showed that peak reproduction occurred in the receding-water period, indicating that the fish had energy deficiencies as a result of reproductive activity. RMI (relative marginal increment) analysis revealed that an annulus is formed once a year during the receding-water period. The population parameters estimated were L-50 (length at sexual maturity) = 31.11 cm, L infinity (asymptotic length) = 68.05 cm, k (growth coefficient) = 0.20. year(-1) and A(0.95) (longevity) = 14 years.

Geoffrey; Thaw, Melissa			Stormwater and Fire as Sources of Black Carbon Nanoparticles to Lake Tahoe	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Emitted to the atmosphere through fire and fossil fuel combustion, refractory black carbon nanoparticles (rBC) impact human health, climate, and the carbon cycle. Eventually these particles enter aquatic environments, where they may affect the fate of other pollutants. While ubiquitous, the particles are still poorly characterized in freshwater systems. Here we present the results of a study determining rBC in waters of the Lake Tahoe watershed in the western United States from 2007 to 2009. The study period spanned a large fire within the Tahoe basin, seasonal snowmelt, and a number of storm events, which resulted in pulses of urban runoff into the lake with rBC concentrations up to 4 orders of magnitude higher than midlake concentrations. The results show that rBC pulses from both the fire and urban runoff were rapidly attenuated suggesting unexpected aggregation or degradation of the particles. We find that those processes prevent rBC concentrations from building up in the clear and oligotrophic Lake Tahoe. This rapid removal of rBC soon after entry into the lake has implications for the transport of rBC in the global aquatic environment and the flux of rBC from continents to the global ocean.

Evaluating aquifer stress and resilience with GRACE information at different spatial scales in Cambodia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater exploitation for different sectors in Cambodia is expanding. Groundwater levels have already begun to decline in some parts of the country. Monitoring and assessing groundwater storage (GWS) change, aquifer stress and aquifer resilience will support the proper planning and management of the country's groundwater resources; however, information regarding groundwater in Cambodia is currently scarce. Thus, GWS change in Cambodia over the 15 years from April 2002 to March 2017 was assessed using remote-sensing-based Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets, with a comprehensive validation of the GRACE-derived groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) with respect to in-situ field-based observations. The current study also investigated the impact of surface water storage (SWS) change in Tonle Sap Lake, South-East Asia's largest freshwater lake, on deriving the GWS change in Cambodia. The groundwater aquifer stresses (GAS), and aquifer resilience (AR) were also evaluated. The validation results were promising, with the correlation coefficient between satellite-based estimations and ground-based measurements ranging from 0.82 to 0.88 over four subbasins. The overall decreasing rate of GWS was found to be -0.63 mm/month, with two basins having the highest declining rate of more than 1.4 mm/month. Meanwhile, the aquifer experiencing stress during the dry season had a very low ability to quickly recover from these stresses. These findings emphasise that appropriate management is urgently needed to ensure the sustainability of the groundwater resource system in this country.

Effect of submerged, freshwater aquatic macrophytes and littoral sediments on pan evaporation in the Lake Balaton region, Hungary	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The evaporation (Er) of a US Class A pan (C) with submerged, freshwater aquatic macrophytes (Potamogeton perfoliatus, Myriophyllum spicatum and Najas marina), hereafter macrophytes (P-s) and a sediment-covered bottom (S) was measured in Hungary during 2014-2015 using reference E of Shuttleworth (E-o) and Penman-Monteith crop reference evapotranspiration (crop ETo). There were two main climatic controls affecting variation in E: direct (air and water temperature) and indirect (wind mediated change affecting the penetration of sunlight; precipitation inflow, impacting plant emergence). Lower seasonal mean E-p rates of 2.75 +/- 0.89, 2.83 +/- 0.91 and 3.06 +/- 1.14 mm day(-1) were observed in C, S and P-s, respectively, during the wet 2014. In the 2015 season, higher overall daily mean E-p rates for C, S and P-s were 3.76 +/- 1.3, 4.19 +/- 1.34 and 4.65 +/- 1.52 mm day(-1), respectively. A comparison of US Class A pan E containing macrophytes/sediments with that of a standard US Class A pan showed that pan coefficients (K-ap and K-as) might allow for more accurate on-site lake E estimates. In 2014, seasonal mean Km and K-ap were 1.04 +/- 0.14 and 1.09 +/- 0.18, respectively. Slightly higher K-a values were observed during the warm and dry 2015 (K-as: 1.15 +/- 0.22; K-ap: 1.26 +/- 0.23). A K-a value greater than 1 indicates that the E of a US Class A pan containing macrophytes and sediment is always higher than that of C. The calculated E-o overestimated measured E-p of P-s during the course of this study. During the warm-dry growing season, crop ETo was closest to E-p of P-s. Empirical coefficients can be useful for estimating E of lakes with submerged macrophytes more precisely. The accuracy of the estimate of Keszthely Bay's E improved by 9.85% when K-a was determined on site. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study assessed the dekadal rainfall patterns and rain days to determine intra-seasonal rainfall variability during the March-May season using the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test and simple linear regression (SLR) over the period 2000-2015. Results showed an increasing trend of both dekadal rainfall amount and rain days (third and seventh dekads).

Increasing nitrate concentrations in streams draining into Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations in offshore waters of Lake Ontario increased by approximately 60% between the 1970s and 2000s, although the drivers are unclear. Here, we show that NO3-N concentrations also increased significantly in at least one season at 13 of 15 large southern Ontario tributaries (8.4 to 2779 km(2)) that drain into Lake Ontario and have no known upstream wastewater treatment plants. Average NO3-N concentrations more than doubled between the 1970s and 2000s at some streams. Only the two most urbanized streams did not show any increase in NO3-N and NO3-N declined at the most urbanized catchment in this study (Sheridan Creek; 92% urban). Agriculture is the predominant form of human activity at the 13 watersheds where NO3-N increased, accounting for 51-71% of total land cover. Both the total area of agricultural land and the type of agriculture have changed dramatically in southern Ontario; and these shifts could alter nutrient transfer to waterways. Specifically, shifts in agriculture towards more N-demanding annual row crops like corn could result in higher NO3-N leakage to streams, and the impact of this form of land use change on nutrient export requires further investigation.

J	Mayora, G; Devercelli, M; Frau, D				Mayora, Gisela; Devercelli, Melina; Frau, Diego			Spatial variability of chromophoric dissolved organic matter in a large floodplain river: control factors and relations with phytoplankton during a low water period	ECOHYDROLOGY												Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) affects ecological processes in freshwater environments. Few studies assessed its spatial variability and relations with phytoplankton in floodplain rivers. Therefore, these topics were examined in a hydrological connectivity gradient in the Middle Parana system. Absorption coefficients at 250 and 365 nm were measured to estimate CDOM concentration and molecular weight (MW), to find their explanatory limnological variables (Redundancy Analysis, RDA), and to assess their contribution to the explanation of phytoplankton structure (Canonical Correspondence Analysis, CCA). Conductivity and turbidity explained CDOM significantly. Increased conductivity from the main channel to floodplain lakes was associated with increased CDOM concentration. The lake indirectly connected to the river showed the highest turbidity associated with high-MW-CDOM, while the isolated lake showed the highest conductivity associated with low-MW-CDOM. Phytoplankton structure was significantly explained by conductivity, turbidity, and high-MW-CDOM (CCA). Environments directly connected to the river (with the lowest conductivity) were associated with diatoms. Phytoflagellates were associated with turbidity and high-MW-CDOM in the lake indirectly connected to the river, whereas Cyanobacteria were associated with conductivity and low-MW-CDOM in the isolated lake. The combined effect of physical factors and CDOM explained the highest fraction of species variation (partial CCA). As a conclusion: (1) CDOM increases as hydrological connectivity with the river decreases; (2) lake sediment resuspension is linked to an increase of high-MW-CDOM; (3) lake isolation from the river corresponds to an increase in low-MW-CDOM; and (4) CDOM explains phytoplankton structure significantly and should be considered as an important variable in studies of microalgal assembly.

Connectivity patterns between floodplain lakes and neighboring streams in the historical floodplain of the Lower Mississippi River	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Hydrologic connectivity, the network of water pathways linking aquatic habitats, is vital for the exchange of organisms and abiotic materials between rivers and adjacent waterbodies. This study quantified hydrologic connectivity for 1,283 lakes in the Lower Mississippi River floodplain using satellite imagery, streamgauge data, and geospatial information. We aimed to assess connection frequency patterns between lakes and streams. Eight metrics describing temporal aspects of hydrologic connectivity were estimated, identifying trends by lake features and by stream size. Each lake exhibited a distinct pattern of connection, with specific months of connectivity followed by disconnection, likely influenced by lake characteristics and seasonal precipitation. Larger lakes showed increased connectivity, likely due to their surface area and volume, while smaller lakes were more prone to isolation, especially during dry periods. Lakes connected to large streams exhibited more prolonged and recurring connections, with less seasonal variation. In contrast, lakes near agricultural areas experienced reduced connectivity. However, local factors such as levees and artificial channels often disrupted these general trends. This hydrologic connectivity analysis can provide insight to support floodplain management, facilitate development of frameworks that restore connectivity, promote preservation of ecological integrity, and support management of invasive species spread in agricultural floodplains.					; ahmad, hafez/B-5642-2019; Dunn, Corey/S-5485-2019	Dunn, Corey/0000-0002-7102-2165; ahmad, hafez/0000-0001-9490-9335; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2024	169								112808	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112808		NOV 2024											WOS:001355219600001
J	Chebud, Y; Melesse, A				Chebud, Y.; Melesse, A.			Stage level, volume and time-frequency information content of Lake Tana using stochastic and wavelet analysis methods	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Lake Tana is the largest fresh water body situated in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. In addition to its ecological services, it serves for local transport, electric power generation, fishing, recreational purposes, and source of dry season irrigation water supply. Evidence shows that the lake has dried at least once at about 15,00017,000 before present owing to a combination of high evaporation and low precipitation events. Past attempts to understand and simulate historical fluctuation of Lake Tana based on simplistic water balance approach of inflow, outflow, and storage have failed to capture well-known events of drawdown and rise of the lake that have happened in the last 44years. This study tested different stochastic methods of lake level and volume simulation for supporting Lake Tana operational planning decision support. Three stochastic methods (perturbations approach, Monte Carlo methods, and wavelet analysis) were employed for lake level and volume simulation, and the results were compared with the stage level measurements. Forty-four years of daily, monthly, and mean annual lake level data have shown a Gaussian variation with goodness of fit at 0.01 significant levels of the KolmogorovSmirnov test. The stochastic simulations predicted the lake stage level of the 1972, 1984, and 2002/2003 historical droughts 99% of the time. The information content (frequency) of fluctuation of Lake Tana for various periods was resolved using Wigner's Time-Frequency Decomposition method. The wavelet analysis agreed with the perturbations and Monte Carlo simulations resolving the time (1970s, 1980s, and 2000s) in which low frequency and high spectral power fluctuation has occurred. The Monte Carlo method has shown its superiority for risk analysis over perturbation and deterministic method whereas wavelet analysis reconstructed historical record of lake stage level at daily and monthly time scales.

J	Watanabe, Y; Baranov, EA; Sato, K; Naito, Y; Miyazaki, N				Watanabe, Yuuki; Baranov, Eugene A.; Sato, Katsufumi; Naito, Yasuhiko; Miyazaki, Nobuyuki			Body density affects stroke patterns in Baikal seals	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Buoyancy is one of the primary external forces acting on air-breathing divers and it can affect their swimming energetics. Because the body composition of marine mammals (i.e. the relative amounts of lower-density lipid and higher-density lean tissue) varies individually and seasonally, their buoyancy also fluctuates widely, and individuals would be expected to adjust their stroke patterns during dives accordingly. To test this prediction, we attached acceleration data loggers to four free-ranging Baikal seals Phoca sibirica in Lake Baikal and monitored flipper stroking activity as well as swimming speed, depth and inclination of the body axis ( pitch). In addition to the logger, one seal ( Individual 4) was equipped with a lead weight that was jettisoned after a predetermined time period so that we had a set of observations on the same individual with different body densities. These four data sets revealed the general diving patterns of Baikal seals and also provided direct insights into the influence of buoyancy on these patterns. Seals repeatedly performed dives of a mean duration of 7.0 min (max. 15.4 min), interrupted by a mean surface duration of 1.2 min. Dive depths were 66 m on average, but varied substantially, with a maximum depth of 324 m. The seals showed different stroke patterns among individuals; some seals stroked at lower rates during descent than ascent, while the others had higher stroke rates during descent than ascent. When the lead weight was detached from Individual 4, the seal increased its stroke rate in descent by shifting swimming mode from prolonged glides to more stroke- and- glide swimming, and decreased its stroke rate in ascent by shifting from continuous stroking to stroke and glide swimming. We conclude that seals adopt different stroke patterns according to their individual buoyancies. We also demonstrate that the terminal speed reached by Individual 4 during prolonged glide in descent depended on its total buoyancy and pitch, with higher speeds reached in the weighted condition and at steeper pitch. A simple physical model allowed us to estimate the body density of the seal from the speed and pitch (1027-1046 kg m(-3), roughly corresponding to 32-41% lipid content, for the weighted condition; 1014-1022 kg m(-3), 43 - 47% lipid content, for the unweighted condition).

Hongze Lake is a typical seasonal lake wetland in the Huaihe River Basin. Its water levels have experienced substantial fluctuations because of climate change, as well as gate and dam regulations. In this study, long-term cloud-free remote sensing images of water body area, net plant productivity (NPP), gross primary productivity (GPP), and Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) of the wetlands of Hongze Lake were obtained from multiple satellites by Google Earth Engine (GEE) from 2006 to 2023. The trends in FVC were analyzed using a combined Theil-Sen estimator and Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Linear regression was employed to analyze the correlation between the area of water bodies and that of different degrees of FVC. Additionally, annual frequencies of various water levels were constructed to explore their association with GPP, NPP, and FVC.The results showed that water level fluctuations significantly influence the spatial and temporal patterns of wetland vegetation cover and carbon sinks, with a significant correlation (P<0.05) between water levels and vegetation distribution. Following extensive restoration efforts, the carbon sink capacity of the Hongze Lake wetland has increased. However, it is essential to consider the carbon sink capacity in areas with low vegetation cover, for the lakeshore zone with a higher inundation frequency and low vegetation cover had a lower carbon sink capacity. These findings provide a scientific basis for the establishment of carbon sink enhancement initiatives, restoration programs, and policies to improve the ecological value of wetland ecosystem conservation areas.																			1664-462X					NOV 5	2024	15								1445906	10.3389/fpls.2024.1445906	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2024.1445906								39563957					WOS:001358757200001
J	Matisoff, G; Wilson, CG; Whiting, PJ				Matisoff, G; Wilson, CG; Whiting, PJ			The 7Be/210Pbxs ratio as an indicator of suspended sediment age or fraction new sediment in suspension	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Reported here is a technique to use the Be-7/Pb-210(xs) ratio as a measure of suspended sediment age or as an indicator of the fraction of the suspended sediment that is recently eroded from the landscape. Although both Be-7 and Pb-210(xs) are delivered seasonally and stochastically to the landscape by precipitation, the ratio of the two radionuclides varies substantially less. The Be-7/Pb-210(xs) ratios measured in three different catchments decrease in the following manner: precipitation (c. 16) > suspended sediments in rivers (6-7) > suspended sediments in estuaries (4-6) > sediment collected in sediment traps in the estuary (C. 1) > surface sediment of the estuary (c. 0(.)5). Decreases in the Be-7/Pb-210(xs) ratio in suspended sediments can be interpreted to be the result of increased age of the sediment, since 7Be decays faster than Pb-210. Alternatively, a decrease in the Be-7/Pb-210(xs) ratio in suspended sediments can be interpreted to be the result of dilution of newly tagged Be-7-rich sediment by Be-7-dead sediment, for example, by erosion of soil below the Be-7-enriched surface layer or by resuspension of Be-7-dead bottom sediment. Presented here is a model which uses the Be-7/Pb-210(xs) ratio in suspended sediments to determine the time since the particles were tagged by precipitation-derived radionuclides (i.e. the age of the suspended sediment). In addition, an alternative model is presented to determine the fraction of the sediment that is 'newly tagged'. These two models are applied to three catchments - Old Woman Creek, Ohio; Weeks Bay, Alabama; and South Slough, Oregon - and yield similar findings at all three sites. Sediment ages increase from 0 in newly tagged material, to 50-80 days in rivers, to about 80-100 days in the estuaries, to about 200 days in the sediment traps, to about 300 days on surface bottom sediments. Alternatively, the percentage new sediment decreases from 100 per cent in newly tagged material, to about 35-50 per cent in rivers, to 25-35 per cent in the estuary, to less than 10 per cent in the sediment traps, to 1-4 per cent on the surface of the bottom sediments.																			0197-9337					AUG	2005	30	9					1191	1201		10.1002/esp.1270	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.1270													WOS:000231784300008
J	Keigwin, LD; Sachs, JP; Rosenthal, Y; Boyle, EA				Keigwin, LD; Sachs, JP; Rosenthal, Y; Boyle, EA			The 8200 year BP event in the slope water system, western subpolar North Atlantic	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												Stable isotope, trace metal, alkenone paleothermometry, and radiocarbon methods have been applied to sediment cores in the western subpolar North Atlantic between Hudson Strait and Cape Hatteras to reveal the history of climate in that region over the past similar to 11 kyr. We focus on cores from the Laurentian Fan, which is known to have rapid and continuous accumulation of hemipelagic sediment. Although results among our various proxy data are not always in agreement, the weight of the evidence (alkenone sea surface temperature (SST), delta(18)O and abundance of Globigerinoides ruber) indicates a continual cooling of surface waters over Laurentian Fan, from about 18 degrees C in the early Holocene to about 8 degrees C today. Alternatively, Mg/Ca data on planktonic foraminifera indicate no systematic change in Holocene SST. The inferred long-term decrease in SST was probably driven by decreasing seasonality of Northern Hemisphere insolation. Two series of proxy data show the gradual cooling was interrupted by a two-step cold pulse that began 8500 years ago, and lasted about 700 years. Although this event is associated with the final deglaciation of Hudson Bay, there is no delta(18)O minimum anywhere in the Labrador Sea, yet there is some evidence for it as far south as Cape Hatteras. Finally, although the 8200 year B. P. event has been implicated in decreasing North Atlantic ventilation, and hence widespread temperature depression on land and at sea, we find inconsistent evidence for a change at that time in deep ocean nutrient content at similar to 4 km water depth.																			0883-8305					APR 15	2005	20	2							PA2003	10.1029/2004PA001074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004PA001074													WOS:000228481900001

Current manual sampling for estimations of CO2 emissions from lakes predominantly relies on daytime CO2 efflux (FCO2) assessments, which tends to overlook the diel variability of F CO 2 . This potentially introduces bias into CO2 emission estimates. The magnitude of diel F CO 2 difference between seasons and the relative importance of underlying drivers in large eutrophic lakes remain inadequately explored. Here, we estimated F CO 2 based on the water quality and meteorological data from Lake Taihu, a large eutrophic lake in China, with a temporal resolution of 4 h throughout the year 2021. The lake was a CO2 source with an efflux of 0.56 +/- 0.66 mmol C/m2/h. We observed a 14.07 % increase in nocturnal F CO 2 compared to daytime levels annually. During the non-growing season, nocturnal F CO 2 exceeds daytime levels by 12.72 %, rising to 39.84 % in the algae-growing season (April to September). Piecewise structural equation models highlight gas transfer velocity as a key driver of diel F CO 2 changes, with seasonal algal growth intensifying diel CO2 partial pressure variability by enhancing gross primary production, thereby amplifying diel F CO 2 fluctuations. We suggest that ongoing lake eutrophication, driven by global climate change and human activities, may introduce additional uncertainties in lake CO2 emission estimates.					wei, he/KCY-2550-2024; Wang, Xuejun/GYV-1579-2022; Wang, Qirui/ABT-2896-2022														0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2024	645		B						132259	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132259		NOV 2024											WOS:001350417900001

Efficiency of reactive nitrogen removal in a model Mediterranean high-mountain lake and its downwater river ecosystem: Biotic and abiotic controls	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												High-mountain lakes and rivers are usually oligotrophic and strongly influenced by atmospheric transport processes. Thus, wet deposition of reactive N species (Nr), mainly in the form of nitrate (NO3-), is a major source of N input in these high-mountain ecosystems. Bacterial denitrifiers are thought to be largely responsible for reduction of NO3- to nitrous oxide (N2O) and molecular dinitrogen (N-2) as main biological pathway of N removal in these ecosystems. Ni-trifiers, through the oxidation of ammonium to NO3-, can also be a source of NO3- and N2O. However, there is uncer-tainty regarding the abiotic and biotic factors controlling Nr elimination from aquatic ecosystems at different altitudes and seasons. We examined the efficiency of Nr removal as N2O and N-2 (total removal) or N-2 only (clean removal) in a model lake and its downwater river ecosystem (Sierra Nevada, Spain) representative of Mediterranean high-mountain freshwater ecosystems along an altitudinal gradient during the warm period of the year. Denitrification activity and the abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in sediments were measured at thaw, mid ice-free and late ice-free periods. We found the efficiency of total and clean removal of Nr increased from the downwater river to the high-mountain lake. Regardless of the location, the efficiency of total removal of Nr decreased over the ice-free period whereas that of clean removal of Nr peaked at mid ice-free period. The efficiency of total removal of Nr was mainly controlled by the abundance of archaeal nitrifiers and bacterial denitrifiers. Abiotic (ammonium and NO3- concentration) and biotic (mainly nosZI-type denitrifiers) factors drove changes in the efficiency of clean removal of Nr. Our results suggest that abiotic and biotic factors can control the efficiencies of Nr removal in Mediterranean high-mountain lakes and their downwater rivers, and that these efficiencies increase with altitude and vary over the ice-free period.

Transcriptome-wide comparison of sequence variation in divergent ecotypes of kokanee salmon	BMC GENOMICS												Background: High throughput next-generation sequencing technology has enabled the collection of genome-wide sequence data and revolutionized single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in a broad range of species. When analyzed within a population genomics framework, SNP-based genotypic data may be used to investigate questions of evolutionary, ecological, and conservation significance in natural populations of non-model organisms. Kokanee salmon are recently diverged freshwater populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that exhibit reproductive ecotypes (stream-spawning and shore-spawning) in lakes throughout western North America and northeast Asia. Current conservation and management strategies may treat these ecotypes as discrete stocks, however their recent divergence and low levels of gene flow make in-season genetic stock identification a challenge. The development of genome-wide SNP markers is an essential step towards fine-scale stock identification, and may enable a direct investigation of the genetic basis of ecotype divergence. Results: We used pooled cDNA samples from both ecotypes of kokanee to generate 750 million base pairs of transcriptome sequence data. These raw data were assembled into 11,074 high coverage contigs from which we identified 32,699 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms. A subset of these putative SNPs was validated using high-resolution melt analysis and Sanger resequencing to genotype independent samples of kokanee and anadromous sockeye salmon. We also identified a number of contigs that were composed entirely of reads from a single ecotype, which may indicate regions of differential gene expression between the two reproductive ecotypes. In addition, we found some evidence for greater pathogen load among the kokanee sampled in stream-spawning habitats, suggesting a possible evolutionary advantage to shore-spawning that warrants further study. Conclusions: This study provides novel genomic resources to support population genetic and genomic studies of both kokanee and anadromous sockeye salmon, and has the potential to produce markers capable of fine-scale stock assessment. While this RNAseq approach was successful at identifying a large number of new SNP loci, we found that the frequency of alleles present in the pooled transcriptome data was not an accurate predictor of population allele frequencies.

First report of toxic Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Raphidiopsis mediterranea (Cyanoprokaryota) in Egyptian fresh waters	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, a potentially toxic and highly adaptable freshwater cyanobacterium, was believed to have been misidentified in the Nile at the end of the 19th century. This study reports the presence of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Raphidiopsis mediterranea for the first time in Egyptian fresh waters since that time. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii appeared in the El-Dowyrat fish pond during May 2002, when bottom waters reached, as a result of climatic change, sufficiently high temperatures to allow the germination of its akinetes in the sediments. Both C. raciborskii and R. mediterranea showed seasonal variations, with highest densities recorded in August of each year. The count of the two species correlated positively with pH, temperature and conductance, and negatively with nutrients, during the study period. The densities of C. raciborskii and R. mediterranea varied significantly along the depth profile of this pond, with peaks obtained at 1 and 0.5m, respectively. Isolates of C. raciborskii and R. mediterranea from this pond exhibited toxicity to Artemia salina, Daphnia magna and mice. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii extracts had hepatotoxic effects on mice, but R. mediterranea extracts showed neurotoxic effects on mice. The identification of toxic C. raciborskii and R. mediterranea in this pond should be considered during the monitoring of cyanobacteria in drinking and recreational water sources in Egypt.

J	Sharip, Z; Mohamad, MF				Sharip, Zati; Mohamad, Mohd Fauzi			Microbial Contamination in Urban Tropical Lentic Waterbodies and Ponds along an Urbanization Gradient	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												This study aimed to investigate the seasonal variation of microbial quality in urban waterbodies along urbanization gradients. Bimonthly samples were collected from 14 recreational lakes and flood mitigation ponds in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, between May and October 2017. Samples were analysed for the presence and abundance of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, faecal coliforms (FC), faecal streptococci (FS), enterococci and total coliforms as indicator organisms, using standard methods. All studied lakes contained indicator bacteria that exceeded the National Lake Water Quality Standards (NLWQS) to varying degrees. The mean of the FC/FS ratios in all lakes exceeded four, indicating that the faecal contamination might have originated from human sources. Escherichia coli, C. perfringens and faecal coliform concentrations were negatively correlated with temperature (P < 0.01) and positively correlated with turbidity and suspended solids (P < 0.05). Non-parametric test results revealed that only the density of C. perfringens varied significantly according to season and urbanization impacts (P < 0.05). The Secchi depth transparency and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels explain the largest variation in bacterial communities. This study showed that contamination of faecal bacteria in the waterbodies varied spatially and temporally along urbanization gradients. Water quality monitoring and improvements are needed before the waterbodies can be used for direct body-contact recreation and as alternative water sources for drinking purposes.

J	Kang, S; Hong, SY				Kang, Sinkyu; Hong, Suk Young			Assessing Seasonal and Inter-Annual Variations of Lake Surface Areas in Mongolia during 2000-2011 Using Minimum Composite MODIS NDVI	PLOS ONE												A minimum composite method was applied to produce a 15-day interval normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily 250 m reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands. This dataset was applied to determine lake surface areas in Mongolia. A total of 73 lakes greater than 6.25 km(2)in area were selected, and 28 of these lakes were used to evaluate detection errors. The minimum composite NDVI showed a better detection performance on lake water pixels than did the official MODIS 16-day 250 m NDVI based on a maximum composite method. The overall lake area detection performance based on the 15-day minimum composite NDVI showed -2.5% error relative to the Landsat-derived lake area for the 28 evaluated lakes. The errors increased with increases in the perimeter-to-area ratio but decreased with lake size over 10 km(2). The lake area decreased by -9.3% at an annual rate of -53.7 km(2) yr(-1) during 2000 to 2011 for the 73 lakes. However, considerable spatial variations, such as slight-to-moderate lake area reductions in semi-arid regions and rapid lake area reductions in arid regions, were also detected. This study demonstrated applicability of MODIS 250 m reflectance data for biweekly monitoring of lake area change and diagnosed considerable lake area reduction and its spatial variability in arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia. Future studies are required for explaining reasons of lake area changes and their spatial variability.																			1932-6203					MAR 23	2016	11	3							e0151395	10.1371/journal.pone.0151395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151395								27007233					WOS:000372701200052

We assessed the hydrological and meteorological variables controlling the occurrence and composition of FGA in Lac Saint-Pierre (LSP), the largest of the St. Lawrence River fluvial lakes. We hypothesized that, under nutrient-rich conditions, hydrology and climate would be the main drivers of FGA occurrence and composition. We tested this hypothesis during the 2005 growing season, by fortnightly sampling at 7 stations within Anse-du-Fort, a 9 km(2) LSP embayment chronically exposed to the inflow of two tributaries draining farmland. Cladophora was the prevalent genus (89% occurrence), but Oedogonium, Hydrodictyon, and Spirogyra were at times dominant. Hydrological (depth, water level change) and meteorological variables (hours of sunshine, wind velocity) were the best predictors of FGA occurrence (r(2) = 0.55), but no water quality variable was significant in any model. The generality of our findings was then assessed using lake-wide FGA occurrence from surveys conducted over 6 years (2000-2001 and 2005-2008) of widely different hydrological and climatic conditions. Years of low water levels (2001 and 2007) coincided with early occurrence, highest prevalence and longest seasonal FGA persistence. Validation of model predictions using remote sensing images yielded a 74% success rate in forecasting FGA. We identified a water level limit for FGA occurrence (<4.07 m above sea level). This limit provides a simple operational guideline for managers, improving our ability to predict FGA proliferation under increasingly low discharge and warming climatic conditions forecasted for the St. Lawrence River.

Aquatic grazers reduce the establishment and growth of riparian plants along an environmental gradient	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The establishment of riparian plants is determined by abiotic conditions and grazing, although it is usually presumed that the former are most important. We tested the impact of aquatic grazers on the survival and growth of establishing riparian plants and whether the impact of grazing interacts with abiotic conditions. 2. We conducted an experiment across 10 Dutch wetlands, covering a large range of water depth and nutrient availability. We introduced 1-year-old plants of an emergent (common reed, Phragmites australis) and a floating (water soldier, Stratiotes aloides) species in individual enclosures (n=5 per site) that excluded predominantly waterbirds, which were the most abundant grazers, and on adjacent unprotected plots. Survival and growth were measured during one growing season. 3. Grazing reduced growth (as biomass) of Phragmites and Stratiotes by a mean of 25 and 60%, respectively. Grazing decreased survival of Stratiotes, but not of Phragmites. Shallow water, water-level fluctuations, eutrophic conditions and enough light favoured both growth and survival of Phragmites. Growth of Stratiotes was unaffected by these factors, but they reduced its survival. For both species, grazing effects on biomass were consistent across environmental conditions, but for Phragmites, grazing effects on survival were influenced by abiotic conditions. 4. We conclude that aquatic grazers significantly reduce the establishment and growth of macrophytes in the riparian zone over a wide range of environmental conditions.

J	Winter, TC				Winter, TC			Relation of streams, lakes, and wetlands to groundwater flow systems	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Surface-water bodies are integral parts of groundwater flow systems. Groundwater interacts with surface water in nearly all landscapes, ranging from small streams, lakes, and wetlands in headwater areas to major river valleys and seacoasts. Although it generally is assumed that topographically high areas are groundwater recharge areas and topographically low areas are groundwater discharge areas, this is true primarily for regional flow systems. The superposition of local flow systems associated with surface-water bodies on this regional framework results in complex interactions between groundwater and surface water in all landscapes, regardless of regional topographic position. Hydrologic processes associated with the surface-water bodies themselves, such as seasonally high surface-water levels and evaporation and transpiration of groundwater from around the perimeter of surface-water bodies, are a major cause of the complex and seasonally dynamic groundwater flow fields associated with surface water. These processes have been documented at research sites in glacial, dune, coastal, mantled karst, and riverine terrains.																			1431-2174					FEB	1999	7	1					28	45		10.1007/s100400050178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s100400050178													WOS:000079767000003
J	Villanueva, MC				Villanueva, Maria Ching			Contrasting tropical estuarine ecosystem functioning and stability: A comparative study	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A comparative study of the Sine-saloum (Senegal) and Gambia (The Gambia) estuaries was performed based on trophic model outputs that describe the system structure and functioning. These trophic models were constructed such as to differentiate main energetic flows in the systems and express how climate change may have impacted ecosystem resilience to change. Estuarine fish assemblages are highly resilient despite exposure to vast hydrodynamic variations and stress. Coupled with strong anthropogenic-driven stresses such as fisheries and climate change, ecosystems may undergo severe regime shifts that may weaken their resilience and stability. Taxonomically related and morphologically similar species do not necessarily play similar ecological roles in these two ecosystems. Biomass and production in the Sine-saloum are concentrated at trophic levels (TLs) 2 and 3, while for the Gambia, both are concentrated at TL3. Higher TL biomasses in Gambia compared to Sine-Saloum may be explained by the latter ecosystem being characterized by inverse hypersalinity. Higher TL. of production in Sine-Saloum is due to higher exploitations compared to Gambia where fishing activities are still less developed. High production and consumption rates of some groups in both ecosystems indicate high system productivity. Elevated productivity may be due to higher abundance of juvenile fishes in most groups that utilize the latter as refuge and/or nursery zones. Both ecosystems are phytoplankton-driven. Differences in group trophic and ecological roles are mainly due to adaptive responses of these species to seasonal and long-term climate and anthropogenic stressors. System indicators suggest different levels of ecosystem resilience and stability as a function of biodiversity. Relevance of other observations on ecosystem functioning and indicators in relation to perturbation is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Metal accumulation in intertidal marshes: Role of sulphide precipitation	WETLANDS												We assessed short-term temporal and spatial variation of metal contents in tile upper 100 cm sediment profile of intertidal marshes vegetated by common reed (Phragmites australis) along the Scheldt estuary in Belgium. The upper 0-100 cm sediment profile was sampled in three reedbeds at 56, 94, and 131 km from the river mouth. Sampling was repeated five times, at approximately two month intervals. Sediment properties such as texture and chloride, carbonate and organic matter content differed among locations. Metal accumulation, which is primarily due to association of metals with organic matter and clay in the surface sediment layer, seemed to be supplemented by an accumulation of sulphide precipitates deeper in the sediments. The depth at which sulphide precipitation significantly contributed to metal accumulation depended on the sampling location, and varied from less than 5 cm in clayey, organic sediments to more than 1 m in sandy sediments. Temporal variation of Cu, Cd, Pb, and Zn concentrations could only be linked to newly formed sulphides or sulphide oxidation at the sites with the lowest sulphide content. At sampling sites containing high sulphide amounts, variations should be primarily attributed to metal exchange and the presence of mobile metal complexes. Litter decomposition at the end of the growing season could hereby play a significant role.					; meers, Erik/A-2789-2016; Meers, Erik/A-2789-2016	Du Laing, Gijs/0000-0001-6661-1312; Tack, Filip M G/0000-0002-6976-7862; meers, Erik/0000-0002-8296-3462; 													0277-5212					SEP	2008	28	3					735	746		10.1672/07-103.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/07-103.1													WOS:000258711600019

Intra-annual variation of phytoplankton community responses to factorial N, P, and CO2 enrichment in a temperate mesotrophic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Across primary producer communities in different lakes, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can exhibit many different patterns of limitation. Here, we look at the intra-annual variability of these patterns in a single lake. Furthermore, we investigate whether a third resource, carbon dioxide (CO2) can have significant effects on phytoplankton biomass and community composition. We performed five in situ lacustrine mesocosm experiments at different times of the year. In each experiment, we had a factorial design with two levels of N, P and CO2 enrichment (no enrichment or double lake concentrations for N and P and atmospheric (400 ppm) and c. 1,000 ppm for CO2) resulting in a total of eight treatments. Mesocosms of c. 1,600 L were suspended in a temperate, mesotrophic lake (Lac Hertel, Canada). Each experiment lasted 2 weeks and chlorophyll a biomass, coarse chemotaxonomic community composition (measured using fluorometry), and several environmental variables were recorded at a minimum of four time points. We found that the limiting, synergistic, and community composition effects of N and P varied between experiments. TN:TP ratios explained, in part, some of this variability, along with insolation and water temperature. Despite relatively high levels of CO2 in the control mesocosms, we found a constant synergistic effect of CO2 with N. In combination with the synergistic effect of P with N found in some experiments, this provides support for CO2 as one of the multiple limiting resources in nutrient-enriched systems. This finding could have implications for eutrophic lakes exposed to increasing concentrations of CO2. We also found that the effects of CO2 on community composition varied intra-annually. Thus, we conclude that generalised predictions about the effect of CO2 on community composition at a coarse chemotaxonomic scale are unlikely to hold, but predictions specific to season and system are likely to be reliable.

Morgan			Structure and composition of forest floor fuels in long-unburned Jeffrey pine-white fir forests of the Lake Tahoe Basin, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												In spite of the mechanistic links between forest floor fuels and fire behaviour and effects, little information is available on their composition and structure. We collected fuels from well-developed forest floors in four long-unburned Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi)-white fir (Abies concolor) forests in the Lake Tahoe Basin in California and Nevada. We measured forest floor (litter, fermentation and humus, where present) load, depth, bulk density and mineral ash content at the base of each tree, near the crown drip line and beyond the crown in open gaps (n=40 Jeffrey pine, 40 white fir). We found substantial variability in composition between the two conifers' forest floor fuels and across species. Forest floor was mounded near tree stems, with the majority of the depth (and mass) composed of fermentation fuels. Humus was present across spatial locations, but was patchier with increasing distance from trees. Ash content varied between trees (fir>pine) and with depth (humus>fermentation>litter). Results highlight the high spatial variation in forest floor fuels and underscore the need for building a greater understanding of forest floor fuels in long-unburned sites.																			1049-8001	1448-5516					2014	23	3					363	372		10.1071/WF13025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF13025													WOS:000335468000006

Skjern River Valley, Northern Europe's most expensive wetland restoration project: benefits to breeding waterbirds	ORNIS FENNICA												After circa 35 years of drainage and intensive arable tillage, the lower Skjern River, Denmark was re-engineered to its original meanders and flooding regime, creating 22 km(2) of lakes, shallow wetlands and seasonally flooded grazed wet grassland costing [SIC]38 million. The primary motivation was to restore the sediment/nutrient retention capacity of the river valley to reduce eutrophication of Ringkobing Fjord at its efflux. Secondary objectives were to (i) restore breeding and staging bird habitat, (ii) enhance the self-sustaining Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar population and (iii) improve recreational and tourist activities. Despite lack of specific success criteria, breeding waterbird numbers increased from 134 +/- 22.9 SE (n = 3) pairs before to 1,744 +/- 153 SE (n = 5) after restoration (although on average 1,004 of these were Black-headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus), species richness and diversity also increased. Twenty-nine waterbird species returned to breed, 10 of national or international significance (Danish Red List/European Union Birds Directive Annex 1 species) now ranking Skjern River amongst the top 10 most important breeding waterbird sites in Denmark. Currently, agriculture supports cost-neutral management of the restoration area, but whilst most expected wet meadow and marsh species had returned, lack of goal-orientated management targets resulted in some additional rare and threatened species remaining absent. Breeding pair density and diversity of other species could have been greatly improved by prior planning and management intervention but at additional cost.

In this study a herbivore exclosure experiment was used to quantify the effects of grazing by large ungulates on herbaceous regrowth and residual aboveground biomass in a fragmented key resource area; the fringe zone around Lake Naivasha, Kenya. Top-down control mechanisms were prevalent in both the dry and wet seasons suggesting the existence of a high resident herbivore density. Intense grazing significantly reduced residual biomass that in turn reduced plant regrowth. An increased frequency of defoliation reduced regrowth during the dry season demonstrating the negative effect resulting from high herbivore densities during the dry season. This study indicates that grazing exerts a higher control on regrowth than rainfall as heavily grazed residual biomass did not recover during the following wet season. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Seiche oscillations in Lake Baikal	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												The variations in the free surface of Lake Baikal at three stations (Bol'shie Koty, Listvyanka, and Baikal'sk) are measured. A modern recording method and an advanced technique of record processing are used. Based on 1-year-long observation data, the amplitudes of seiche oscillations and their seasonal changes are analyzed. It is found, in particular, that 67-min seiches are manifested in different seasons. Numerical calculations of seiches in Lake Baikal are made with the use of up-to-date bathymetric data on one-dimensional, plan, and spherical models. Spatial structures of oscillations with periods of 277, 152, 84, 67, and 59 min, corresponding to the well-expressed peaks of power spectral density, are studied. It is shown that the first four periods correspond to uninodal, binodal, trinodal, and quadrinodal longitudinal seiche modes of Lake Baikal. The periods of three solutions can correspond to the value of 59 min. The first of them is the seiche of the lake's South Basin, and two others are characterized by significant amplitude growth in the Small Sea and Chivyrkui Bay.

Italy)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The seasonal variation of seston stable isotopes signature of carbon (delta C-13) in Lake Maggiore during 2008 was related to seasonal variation of the lake phytoplankton community, investigated in terms of phytoplankton taxonomic groups, morpho-functional groups (MBFG), cell size classes and cell shape classes. Three open water stations were selected to reflect truly pelagic, influenced by littoral and riverine carbon sources: phytoplankton samples were collected from two water depths, 0-20 m and 25-50 m. Among stations differences in delta C-13 signatures of seston were statistically non significant, confirming that allochthonous input may become important only after exceptional rainfall events. Nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was utilized to identify among the phytoplankton parameters (taxonomic groups, MBFG, cell shapes, cell sizes) which were the best predictors of the PC variation. Bacillariophyceae and two morpho-functional groups, Group 6 (non-flagellated organisms with siliceous exoskeletons) and Group 3 (large filamentous algae with aerotopes) were statistically significant. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was used to investigate differences in phytoplankton samples and their relationship with delta C-13 variation. When morphological and functional phytoplankton traits were superimposed, the NMS ordination showed that cylinder cells (for cell shape classes), class 500-2000 mu m(3) (for cell size classes) and Group 6 (for MBFG) were the most related to delta C-13 variation. Our study confirms that the variation in the pelagic VC seston most probably reflects changes in phytoplankton carbon isotopic signature, consequent to changes in availability of carbon sources depending on the season and due to different isotopic fractionation of phytoplankton taxonomic groups. Statistical investigations have allowed us to investigate the potential role of phytoplankton morphological and functional traits in the seasonal variation of delta C-13 and to suggest their importance in the interpretation of natural stable isotopes studies in lake ecosystems.

Eels were separated into three groups using otolith microchemistry: 'migrants' that grew in the inlet rivers and then made a downstream migration to Hamana Lake mainly in October and November; 'nonmigrant' yellow eels caught in rivers during the same season; and 'residents,' which were yellow eels caught in rivers in August. Sex steroid levels, especially those of testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone, were higher in migrants than in non-migrants and residents. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that mRNA levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) beta-subunits were significantly higher in migrants than in other groups, whereas those of follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunits did not show significant changes during downstream migration. The high levels of these hormones during downstream migration raise the question about if they also play a role in motivating the migratory behavior of eels.																			0289-0003					MAR	2011	28	3					180	188		10.2108/zsj.28.180	http://dx.doi.org/10.2108/zsj.28.180								21385058					WOS:000287731000003
J	Prendergast, ME				Prendergast, Mary E.			Kansyore fisher-foragers and transitions to food production in East Africa: the view from Wadh Lang'o, Nyanza Province, Western Kenya	AZANIA-ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN AFRICA												The site of Wadh Lang'o in southern Nyanza Province (Kenya) has produced a very large faunal assemblage in association with Kansyore, Elmenteitan and Urewe ceramics. The stratigraphy of the site appears to be intact and six dates have been obtained from the sequence, making this the best opportunity to look at diachronic change in subsistence strategies in this region. The main results of the zooarchaeological analysis are presented here, with emphasis on the Kansyore component. Two important findings are discussed: first, the fish remains, when taken together with remains from other Kansyore sites and considering the behavioural traits of these fish, suggest that Kansyore riverside and lakeshore sites were occupied in distinct seasons and used together in a single settlement and subsistence system. Second, the mammalian remains suggest that while Kansyore foragers hunted a broad range of taxa, they also began to consume domesticates perhaps as early as the mid- to late-third millennium cal. BC. This suggests that occupants of late Kansyore sites were in contact with food producers, but whether the domestic animal remains are the result of exchange, or of adopting food production, remains ambiguous.																			0067-270X	1945-5534					2010	45	1			SI		83	111		10.1080/00672700903291765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00672700903291765													WOS:000293469600005

Here, sediments from 12 selected reservoirs from the Wujiang and Pearl River basins in southwest China were investigated using 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing and quantitative PCR for archaeal abundance and richness in all seasons. Generally, archaeal abundance and alpha-diversity were significantly correlated with temperature; however, beta-diversity analysis showed that community structures varied greatly among locations rather than seasons, indicating a distance-decay pattern with geographical variation. The null model revealed the major contribution of stochasticity to archaeal community assembly, which was further confirmed by the neutral community model that could explain 71.7% and 90.2% of the variance in archaeal assembly in the Wujiang and Pearl River basins, respectively. Moreover, sediment total nitrogen and organic carbon levels were significantly correlated with archaeal abundance and alpha-diversity. Interestingly, these nutrient levels were positively and negatively correlated, respectively, with the abundance of methanogenic and ammonia-oxidized archaea: the dominant sedimentary archaea in these reservoirs. Taken together, this work systematically characterized archaeal community profiles in reservoir sediments and demonstrated the combined action of stochastic processes and nutrient load in shaping archaeal communities in reservoir ecosystems.

Response of lotic microbial communities to altered water source and nutritional state in a glaciated alpine floodplain	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Factors driving bacterial community composition (BCC) and linkages to ecosystem function (EF) are a fundamental interest in microbial ecology. Climate warming is expected to cause a shift from glacial- to groundwater-dominated water sources in alpine catchments due to receding glaciers, which is likely accompanied by a shift in BCC and EF. In this context, we performed a reciprocal transplant experiment of hyporheic sediments within a Swiss alpine floodplain. We assessed the influence of water source (groundwater = krenal, glacial water = kryal) and nutritional state (C, N, and P) on BCC and EF. Experimental response was tested using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification and potential activities of eight different enzymes. BCC from both kryal and krenal systems was highly resistant to changes in water source, yet exhibited pronounced EF flexibility. Major factors determining BCC and EF response were sediment origin followed by seasonal variation in BCC. The gradient in seasonal change in BCC showed different strengths in the two water systems. Krenal BCC was more seasonally stable compared with kryal BCC, although functional plasticity showed the same extent in both. This difference in connectivity between BCC and EF suggests that krenal BCC was dominated by generalists, whereas kryal BCC was dominated by specialists. The weak effect of altered nutritional state on BCC and EF indicates a complex but hierarchically structured relationship among these factors. We conclude that microbial communities in alpine catchments are able to rapidly buffer the effect of shifts in water source on ecosystem functioning.					; Burgmann, Helmut/E-8804-2011	Freimann, Remo/0000-0002-8955-2842; Burgmann, Helmut/0000-0002-5651-5906													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2013	58	3					951	965		10.4319/lo.2013.58.3.0951	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.3.0951													WOS:000322491100016

M.; Lundy, Mark			Dissolved Phosphorus Losses by Lateral Seepage from Swine Manure Amendments for Organic Rice Production	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Because excessive P fertilizer application in rice (Oryza sativa L.) systems leads to P losses in ambient waters, P management strategies that satisfy crop P demand while minimizing P loss are essential to productive and environmentally benign rice production. The main objective of this paddy field experiment was to measure the effects of organic fertilization via swine (Sus scrofa) manure on dissolved P losses by lateral seepage from organic rice production. Four swine manure organic amendment rates (0 [Ctr], 26 [Low], 39 [Middle], and 52 [High] kg P ha(-1)) were applied over the course of three rice growing seasons in 4- by 5-m plots constructed to facilitate the measurement of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and reactive phosphorus (DRP) via lateral seepage and surface runoff. The TDP and DRP concentrations in the lateral seepage water increased with increasing amendment rates. Lateral seepage was one of the important pathways of P losses from organic paddy fields. The seasonal averages of TDP fluxes by lateral seepage varied from 1.95 to 4.30 g P m(-1) (bund scale) and 0.39 to 0.86 g P m(-2) (plot scale) among the amendment rates (from low to high), accounting for 13.0 to 15.6% of the total P applied. In addition, floodwater level acted as the main driving force for the P lateral seepage losses from paddy fields, with a positive linear relationship (R-2 = 0.50) between floodwater level and daily lateral flow during the flooded periods (P = 0.05). Based on these results, P lateral seepage losses from organic rice production system would be minimized by shallow floodwater management and low swine manure amendment.					li, hua/JYV-5056-2024; Li, Liang/H-6189-2017; ye, yushi/HJI-4098-2023; He, miaomiao/MYR-8706-2025	Lundy, Mark/0000-0003-4043-0841; 													0361-5995	1435-0661				MAY	2013	77	3					765	773		10.2136/sssaj2012.0345	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2012.0345													WOS:000322082400008

Spatial and temporal patterns in total phosphorus in south-central Ontario streams: the role of wetlands and past disturbance	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Unraveling the cause(s) of declines in total phosphorus (TP) observed over the past three decades across many forested catchments in central Ontario remains a research priority. The objectives of this paper were firstly to test the assumption that weir water chemistry is representative of catchment changes at two adjacent headwater streams that have shown declines in TP and secondly use long-term measurements of weir water quality (1980-2008) to identify potential drivers of TP declines. Longitudinal measurements confirmed that weir water chemistry is generally representative of the entire stream channel, although channel-associated wetlands have a strong influence on TP. Additionally, processes operating in wetlands dictate seasonal patterns in TP, and differences in wetland cover explain the approximately twofold difference in average TP between the two catchments. Changes in wetland cover or processes, however, cannot explain declines in TP. Rather, declines in TP are most coherent with declines in stream potassium (K) and nitrate (NO3-N), which also occurred over the past 30 years. We suggest that coincident declines in TP, NO3-N, and K may be best explained by recovery from a disturbance event.					; Eimers, Catherine/AAZ-1274-2021; Casson, Nora/P-1915-2018	Casson, Nora/0000-0002-0701-1816; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2013	70	5					766	774		10.1139/cjfas-2012-0474	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2012-0474													WOS:000319257700011

Defining algal bloom phenology in Lake Erie	HARMFUL ALGAE												Elucidating the impact of global climate change on aquatic ecosystems, particularly through phenological shifts in primary producers, is critical for understanding ecological resilience. Here, we focus on the phenological shifts in chlorophyll as a proxy for algae biomass and primary production in aquatic ecosystems, specifically in Lake Erie as well as concentrations of the toxin microcystin. By tracking temporal changes in each, we identified key phenological phases important to estimate duration, magnitude, and intensity of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Determining which influential biotic and abiotic factors such as temperature, wind speed, nutrient availability, and climate change is most important, is a long-term management need for Lake Erie, which can be explored using our methodology. Our novel statistical framework employing Bayesian generalized additive mixed models described seasonal chlorophyll and particulate microcystin concentration from Lake Erie and our simple geometric method identified the start, peak, and end of algal blooms. This research enhances our understanding of the ecological effects of nutrient pollution on aquatic ecosystems and provides a repeatable method for determining phenological events without the need for user defined cutoffs which aids in the management and mitigation of HABs, safeguarding water quality in regions dependent on lakes for drinking water.					; Isabwe, Alain/AGK-8324-2022; Godwin, Casey/E-6892-2014; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020	Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; Godwin, Casey/0000-0002-4454-7521; Isabwe, Alain/0000-0002-7420-6453; Maguire, Timothy/0000-0002-7742-769X; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				NOV	2024	139								102731	10.1016/j.hal.2024.102731	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2024.102731		OCT 2024						39567068					WOS:001344225900001

A total of 11 major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, NH4+, F-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, NO2-, HCO3-) along with six on-site parameters (temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity) were sampled in replicates from 18 sites in Lake Rara and 13 sites in Lake Ghodaghodi. Major ions were analyzed using ion chromatography including field and procedural blanks to maintain quality standards, whereas on-site parameters were measured by using standard multi-meter probes. The most dominant cation and anions were Ca2+ and HCO3- in both lakes indicating rock dominance through carbonate weathering as the primary source of dissolved ions in the lake waters. Further analysis indicated that Rara belongs to Ca(Mg)HCO3 and Ghodaghodi belongs to Ca-HCO3 type. The higher concentrations of Na+ and Cl- during the post-monsoon indicates a possibility of long-range marine transport through monsoon precipitation.

However, the application of these indices to assess trophic states in large barrier lakes is rare, especially in China. To test the usefulness of phytoplankton taxonomic alpha-diversity indices in trophic state assessments, we investigated the taxonomic alpha-diversity-Comprehensive Trophic Level Index (TLI) relationships in the second largest alpine lava barrier lake (Jingpo Lake, China) in the rainy and dry season from 2017 to 2018. Based on a two-year dataset, we found that there was a significant difference in the phytoplankton community, alpha-diversity indices, and TLI dynamic between the rainy season and the dry season. First, there was significant variation in phytoplankton abundance, the Margalef index, and the Shannon-Wiener index in different hydrological periods (p < 0.05). Second, the mean TLI in the rainy season (44 +/- 5) was higher than in the dry season (41 +/- 5) (p < 0.05). Lastly, the response characteristics of the Margalef and Shannon-Wiener index with TLI were different in different hydrological periods, and the relationship between the Pielou evenness index and TLI was weak. This study highlights that phytoplankton taxonomic alpha-diversity indices are relevant tools in water quality assessments but selecting the fit index is necessary. The current study provides key information about phytoplankton community, alpha-diversity, and trophic states in the largest alpine lava barrier lake, and the results of the study will benefit water quality management and biodiversity conservation in barrier lakes.

Vegetation shadow casts impact remotely sensed reflectance from permafrost thaw ponds in the subarctic forest-tundra zone	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Thermokarst lakes and ponds are a common landscape feature resulting from permafrost thaw, but their intense greenhouse gas emissions are still poorly constrained as a feedback mechanism for global warming because of their diversity, abundance, and remoteness. Thermokarst waterbodies may be small and optically diverse, posing specific challenges for optical remote sensing regarding detection, classification, and monitoring. This is especially relevant when accounting for external factors that affect water reflectance, such as scattering and vegetation shadow casts. In this study, we evaluated the effects of shadowing across optically diverse waterbodies located in the forest-tundra zone of northern Canada. We used ultra-high spatial resolution multispectral data and digital surface models obtained from unmanned aerial systems for modeling and analyzing shadow effects on water reflectance at Earth Observation satellite overpass time. Our results show that shadowing causes variations in reflectance, reducing the usable area of remotely sensed pixels for waterbody analysis in small lakes and ponds. The effects were greater on brighter and turbid inorganic thermokarst lakes embedded in post-glacial silt-clay marine deposits and littoral sands, where the mean reflectance decrease was from -51 to -70%, depending on the wavelength. These effects were also dependent on lake shape and vegetation height and were amplified in the cold season due to low solar elevations. Remote sensing will increasingly play a key role in assessing thermokarst lake responses and feedbacks to global change, and this study shows the magnitude and sources of optical variations caused by shading that need to be considered in future analyses.

Human-hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) interactions in villages adjacent to Lake Babati, Tanzania	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) are herbivores and semi-aquatic feeding on farmlands mainly at night. Although human-hippopotamus interactions are known to occur, there is little information in the area surrounding Lake Babati. The study aimed to assess: the areas dominated by hippo visits; problems caused by hippos to the local communities'; major challenges to crops compared to hippos, crops preferred by hippos and seasonal variations in hippo visits across the study villages. Semi structured questionnaire, focused group discussions and direct observation methods were used in data collection. The findings reveal that the hippos mostly visit the farms and residential areas closer to the lake (>3 km) across the villages. Hippos were perceived as the major challenge to crops compared to drought and diseases. The respondents closer to the lake reported crop raiding as the major problem caused by hippos and the incidents reported to be severe during the rainy season. Maize crop was reported to be highly preferred by hippos compared to other crops. The study recommends to the key stakeholders to come up with proper management strategies giving priority to the areas within 3 km adjacent the lake. This may include establishment of the buffer zone and growing alternative crops that are not preferred by the hippos so as to attain hippos' conservation and livelihoods development goals.

Three of these regions are located over deep-rooted tectonic faults or salt diapirs and one is in an area without any tectonic or halokinetic activity, but with steep topography. Contrary to recently published studies on spatial patterns of soil radon gas concentration we measured flux of radon from soil into the atmosphere. All radon devices of each profile were deployed simultaneously to avoid inconsistencies due to strong diurnal variations of radon exhalation. To compare data from different seasons, values had to be normalized. Observed radon flux patterns are apparently related to the mineralogical composition of the Quaternary strata (particularly to the abundance of reddish granite and porphyry), and its grain size (with a flux maximum in well-sorted sand/silt). Minimum radon flux occurs above non-permeable, clay-rich soil layers. Small amounts of water content in the pore space increase radon flux, whereas excessive water content lessens it. Peak flux values, however, are observed over a deep-rooted fault system on the eastern side of Lake Plon, i.e., at the boundary of the Eastholstein Platform and the Eastholstein Trough. Furthermore, high radon flux values are observed in two regions associated with salt diapirism and near-surface halokinetic faults. These regions show frequent local radon flux maxima, which indicate that the uppermost strata above salt diapirs are very inhomogeneous. Deep-rooted increased permeability (effective radon flux depth) or just the boundaries between permeable and impermeable strata appear to concentrate radon flux. In summary, our radon flux profiles are in accordance with the published evidence of low radon concentrations in the "normal" soils of Schleswig-Holstein. However, very high values of radon flux are likely to occur at distinct locations near salt diapirism at depth, boundaries between permeable and impermeable strata, and finally at the tectonically active flanks of the North German Basin.

The lakes considered, located in the Latium region, differed with respect to their volcanic (Bolsena and Bracciano Lakes) or artificial (Salto Lake) origin. Fillets of fish caught in the three lakes were characterised by good protein (17-19%) and mineral contents and low lipid levels (0.6-1.2%) throughout the year. Total lipids were characterised by low cholesterol levels (41.9-74.7 mg/100 g) and high percentages of total n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (27.7-33.8% of total fatty acids), in particular docosahexaenoic acid (14.2-25.3% of total fatty acids). The qualitative analysis of the stomach content of perch confirmed their predatory feeding behaviour. The chemical and nutritional profiles of perch from the three lakes were comparable except for rubidium and cesium levels, which were higher in the muscle tissues of perch from the volcanic lakes. These minerals may represent elements of traceability of the origin of fish. Low levels of organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, well below the Italian and European action limits, were detected in the muscle tissue of perch from all three lakes.

The effects of temperature and predator-prey interactions on the migration behavior and vertical distribution of Mysis relicta	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The extent to which temperature, temperature gradients, predator smell, and prey availability influence the migratory behaviors and vertical distribution of the opossum shrimp, Mysis relicta, was explored through controlled laboratory experiments and comparisons with field distributions of mysids in Lake Ontario. By varying environmental conditions in 2-m tall experimental columns in a temperature-controlled room, we determined that mysids prefer temperatures between 6 degrees C and 8 degrees C with limited movement into waters of 12 degrees C or higher. No mysids moved into waters above 16 degrees C in the absence of prey. However, a higher proportion of mysids moved into temperatures of 14 degrees C and 16 degrees C (but not 18 degrees C) when densities of Daphnia pulicaria exceeding 120 L-1 were present at those temperatures. Mysis avoided waters with kairomones from a primary mysid predator, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). The rate of temperature change with depth did not restrict mysid movements. A temperature preference function based on the experimental data was applied to an existing model of mysid vertical distribution. The modified model predicted the depth of maximum mysid density to within 1 m and yielded high percentage overlap index values when compared with published mysid vertical distributions in Lake Ontario. Our approach may be used to model how diurnal, seasonal, and larger climactic changes can impact both the vertical position and feeding ecology of mysids, a keystone species in many deep-water pelagic food webs.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2007	52	4					1599	1613		10.4319/lo.2007.52.4.1599	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.4.1599													WOS:000248215800027

Development and evaluation of a physically-based lake level model for water resource management: A case study for Lake Buchanan, Texas	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Lake Buchanan, a major reservoir for the City of Austin area, the Texas Hydrologic Region 12, USA. Numerical climate models are increasingly being used by climate scientists to inform water management. However, successful transitions from climate models (0(10-100 km)) to water resources studies (0(100 m-1 km)) still need improved data structures and modeling strategies to resolve spatial scale mismatch. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic lake-level modeling framework that consists of a state-of-the-art land surface model Noah-MP, a vector-based river routing scheme - RAPID, and a lake mass-balance model. By conducting a case study for Lake Buchanan, we demonstrate the capability of the framework in predicting lake levels at seasonal lead times. The experiments take into account different runoff resolutions, model initialization months, and multiple lead times. Uncertainty analyses and sensitivity tests are also conducted to guide future research. New hydrological insights: Different from traditional grid-based solutions, the framework is directly coupled on the vector-based NHDPlus dataset, which defines accurate hydrologic features such as rivers, dams, lakes and reservoirs. The resulting hybrid framework therefore allows for more flexibility in resolving "scaling-issues" between large-scale climate models and fine-scale applications. The presented hindcast results also provide insight into the influences of baseline LSM resolutions, initialization months, and lead times, which would ultimately help improve lake-level forecast skills.

JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Landscape alterations can obstruct movement corridors and degrade spawning habitats for migratory fishes, requiring expensive restoration efforts. To assess use of natural and artificial waterways for spawning migrations, we monitored adult migrations and young-of-year production of northern pike (Esox lucius) for two years in six adjacent tributaries of southern Green Bay on Lake Michigan, USA. Field observations were compared with natal origins of young-of-year and adults inferred from otolith microchemistry. Individual tributaries varied widely in their production of young-of-year pike. Microchemical differences were apparent only among tributaries whose watersheds differ in land use, and adult pike showed no evidence of homing even to the same tributary land use class where they were born. Though otolith microchemistry suggests a lack of fidelity to natal streams, carbon stable isotope ratios of adult pike showed a latitudinal gradient across tributaries, suggesting that adult pike do not mix freely outside of the breeding season. Both field observations and microchemical tracing suggest that pike can potentially recolonize historical or newly-created breeding habitats after restoration efforts make them accessible.

The responses of these phenomena to global environmental changes are sensitive, rapid and intensive due to the high altitudes and arid cold climate of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on multisource remote sensing data, including Landsat images, MOD10A2 snow product, ICESat, Cryosat-2 altimetry data and long-term ground climate observations, we analysed the dynamic changes of glaciers, snow melting and lake in the Paiku Co basin using extraction methods for glaciers and lake, the degree-day model and the ice and lake volume method. The interaction among the climate, ice-snow and the hydrological elements in Paiku Co is revealed. From 2000 to 2018, the basin tended to be drier, and rainfall decreased at a rate of -3.07 mm/a. The seasonal temperature difference in the basin increased, the maximum temperature increased at a rate of 0.02 degrees C/a and the minimum temperature decreased at a rate of -0.06 degrees C/a, which accelerated the melting from glaciers and snow at rates of 0.55 x 10(7) m(3)/a and 0.29 x 10(7) m(3)/a, respectively. The rate of contribution to the lake from rainfall, snow and glacier melted water was 55.6, 27.7 and 16.7%, respectively. In the past 18 years, the warmer and drier climate has caused the lake to shrink. The water level of the lake continued to decline at a rate of -0.02 m/a, and the lake water volume decreased by 4.85 x 10(8) m(3) at a rate of -0.27 x 10(8) m(3)/a from 2000 to 2018. This evaluation is important for understanding how the snow and ice melting in the central Himalayas affect the regional water cycle.

Further, an unstructured-grid, three-dimensional finite-volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM) is applied to investigate the wind-induced currents and the transport process to explain the reason why algal blooms occur at the detected places. We first deduce the primary distribution of biomass from overlaid satellite images, and explain the formation mechanism by analyzing the pollution sources, and simulating the flow field and transportation process under prevailing wind over Chaohu Lake. And then, we consider the adjustment action of the wind on the corresponding day and develop a two-time scale approach to describe the whole formation process of algae horizontal distribution in Chaohu Lake. That is, on the longer time scale, i.e., during bloom season, prevailing wind determines the primary distribution of biomass by inducing the characteristic flow field; on the shorter time scale, i.e., on the day when bloom occurs, the wind force adjusts the primary distribution of biomass to form the final distribution of algal bloom.

Annual carbon fixation in terrestrial populations of Nostoc commune (Cyanobacteria) from an Antarctic dry valley is driven by temperature regime	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Nostoc commune Vaucher (a cyanobacterium) is a very conspicuous terrestrial primary producer in Victoria Land, continental Antarctica. Because polar ecosystems are considered to be especially sensitive to environmental changes, understanding the environmental constraints on net carbon (C) fixation by N. commune is necessary to determine the effects of environmental changes on the ecological functioning of ice-free areas of the continent. A model describing net C fixation in terrestrial populations of N. commune in an Antarctic dry valley was constructed using field and laboratory measurements in which N. commune colonies were exposed to different combinations of incident irradiance (400-700 nm), temperature, and degree of desiccation. For desiccated N. commune mats with water content <= 30% saturation, net C fixation was highly variable between replicates and could not be modelled. However, for colonies at > 30% saturation, rates of net C fixation and dark respiration depended strongly on irradiance and temperature. Net C fixation reached a maximum rate of 21.6 mu g C m (- 2) s (- 1) at irradiance of approximately 250 mu mol m (- 2) s(- 1) and the optimum temperature of 20.5 degrees C. Agreement between predicted short-term net C fixation and field and laboratory measurements allowed estimation of total seasonal fixation, using previously published environmental data. Annual net C fixation was estimated in the range 14.5-21.0 g C fixed m (- 2) Nostoc mat, depending on year/season. Estimates for different seasons correlated with thermal time (accumulated hours above 0 degrees C during the year) rather than irradiance, in contrast to communities in local lacustrine environments, where irradiance is the main driver of primary productivity. In the terrestrial habitat, N. commune appears to compromise between an ability to capitalize on short periods of higher temperature and efficient utilization of lower irradiance at low temperature. The relationship between thermal time and net annual C fixation by N. commune is strongly linear.

This was done on experimental plots at a boreal, low sedge mire where the effect of long-term addition of SO42- on peat pore water MeHg concentrations was observed weekly throughout the snow-free portion of 1999. The additions of SO42- started in 1995. The seasonal mean of the pore water MeHg concentrations on the plots with 17 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of sulphur (S) addition (1.3 +/- 0.08 ng L-1, SE; n=44) was significantly (p<0.0001) higher than the mean MeHg concentration on the plots with 3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) of ambient S deposition (0.6 +/- 0.02 ng L-1, SE; n=44). The temporal variation in pore water MeHg concentrations during the snow free season was larger in the S-addition plots, with an amplitude of >2 ng L-1 compared to +/-0.5 ng L-1 in the ambient S deposition plots. The concentrations of pore water MeHg in the S-addition plots were positively correlated (r(2)=0.21; p=0.001) to the groundwater level, with the lowest concentrations of MeHg during the period with the lowest groundwater levels. The pore water MeHg concentrations were not correlated to total Hg, DOC concentration or pH. The results from this study indicate that the persistently higher pore water concentrations of MeHg in the S-addition plots are caused by the long-term additions of SO42- to the mire surface. Since these waters are an important source of runoff, the results support the hypothesis that SO42- deposition has increased the contribution of peatlands to MeHg in downstream aquatic systems. This would mean that the increased deposition of SO42- in acid rain has contributed to the modern increase in the MeHg burdens of remote lakes hydrologically connected to peatlands.

We studied temporal and spatial variations in fluorescence index (FI) and specific UV absorbance (SUVA) of DOM to identify DOM sources and fate during the flood. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations ranged from 2 to 25 mg C L-1 in channels of the Delta, with seasonal floodplains having consistently higher concentrations. Chemical indices, such as DOC concentrations, conductivity, specific UV absorbance (SUVA), fluorescence, total dissolved nitrogen, and chlorophyll a, were analyzed for channel and floodplain sites in the Seasonal Swamp. DOC concentrations increased during the rising limb of the flood in the Seasonal Swamp. SUVA of whole water samples and fluorescence index (FI) of fulvic acids isolated from channel and floodplain sites changed in a manner indicating the release of DOM by leaching of plant litter during the flood. After the flood receded, DOC concentrations and fulvic acid content decreased, and microbially-derived sources of organic matter dominated. Along two river reaches, measuring over 400 km each, variations in DOC concentrations were primarily due to geomorphology, with the effects of the annual flood overprinted atop the spatial controls. Increasing downstream DOC concentrations were found to be a product of inundation of DOC-rich seasonal floodplains and evaporation-enriched waters downstream. Increasing SUVA, dissolved nitrogen, and fulvic acid content, and decreasing FI downstream suggested microbial processing of terrestrial DOM and possible release of nutrients incorporated in the DOM.					; Wolski, Piotr/J-9133-2014	MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533; Wolski, Piotr/0000-0002-6120-6593													0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2005	25	3					622	638		10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0622:EOAFOD]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2005)025[0622:EOAFOD]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000232130300011

The landscape is stratified into five habitat types in a gradient from wetland to forested mountains. Bird species found in these habitats can be classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degrees of aquatic specialisation and increasing forest specialisation. For each surveyed species, five ecological status were assigned. Overall, there was lower species richness in urban areas compared to other "natural" habitats. Birds have a biogeographical affinity to the western Palaearctic according to the dominant faunal types. Interactions of ecological status with phenological traits reveal that water birds are different from non-aquatic species because most of them are migrants. Moreover, overall, there is no worrying conservation status for surveyed birds. Bird diet is dependent on the ecological status that differentiate bird groups from each other due to differences in the food resources of the habitats they frequent. Phenological categories tend to link together birds of urban and open-lands. These two groups are affected by seasonal human activities. Our findings emphasise the importance of using combinations within the birds' ecological status, which would give information on the actual state of avifauna. This approach is relevant for future programmes and conservation actions.					; Chenchouni, Haroun/I-7494-2012; Abdelkrim, SI BACHIR/AAI-5826-2020; Moussa, Houhamdi/J-2708-2018	Chenchouni, Haroun/0000-0001-9077-2706; Si Bachir, Abdelkrim/0000-0001-8501-1830; Moussa, Houhamdi/0000-0002-4644-8906; Bensizerara, Djamel/0000-0001-9930-0668													1758-1559	1758-1567					2013	6	1					67	77		10.3184/175815513X13577344603957	http://dx.doi.org/10.3184/175815513X13577344603957													WOS:000316250000009

Dissolved organic matter quantity and quality in Lake Simcoe compared to two other large lakes in southern Ontario	INLAND WATERS												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical component in ecosystem processes and is the largest pool of organic carbon (C) in aquatic environments. In this study, we investigated the variability in quantity and quality of DOM in 3 large lakes in southern Ontario. Water quality parameters were coupled with excitation emission fluorescence spectroscopy and absorption spectra to characterize the DOM and investigate the overarching factors controlling DOM dynamics. The results show that Lake Simcoe has higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations than lakes Erie, Ontario, and Hamilton Harbour (an embayment in western Lake Ontario) and suggest that a DOM source independent of watershed inputs is likely an important contributor to the DOC in this system. Five components were identified through parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), representative of both terrestrial and microbial origin. Their relative intensities in the 4 Lake Simcoe end-members allowed the identification of dominant DOM sources in our studied ecosystems. Lake Simcoe seems to have a similar contribution of agriculturally derived DOM to lakes Erie, Ontario, and Hamilton Harbour. Lake Ontario, including Hamilton Harbour had on average a larger input of DOM derived from wastewater treatment plant effluents. The seasonal patterns in the different optical characteristics of DOM in Lake Simcoe compared to other systems suggested that DOM qualitative transformations, be it through photooxidation or microbial degradation, are likely very important processes in this lake. The role of DOM in Lake Simcoe may have important ecological implications for the cycling of C and the oxygen regime of this lake.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2013	3	2					139	152		10.5268/IW-3.2.535	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-3.2.535													WOS:000318267500003

In 2012 and 2014, two systematic surveys were conducted on Mount Chikiani (Koyunda) with the aim of defining the areas from which obsidian was obtained during different prehistoric periods, and to characterise its sources (Biagi & Gratuze 2016). A longer season of archaeological prospection was carried out in 2016. Among the many important finds was the discovery of a large number of obsidian mining pits along the northern and north-eastern lower slopes of the volcano (Figure 1), as well as several obsidian workshops. During the 2016 season, research focused on the 2417m-high trachyrhyolitic domea source of high-quality obsidianemerging from the plain around 300m north-east of Lake Paravani.					; GRATUZE, Bernard/P-4687-2016; Biagi, Paolo/ABB-3359-2022	GRATUZE, Bernard/0000-0001-6136-8085; 													0003-598X	1745-1744				JUN	2017	91	357							e5	10.15184/aqy.2017.39	http://dx.doi.org/10.15184/aqy.2017.39													WOS:000403434700007

Predatory invertebrates and planktivorous fish both feed on herbivorous zooplankton, while the planktivorous fish also feed on the predatory invertebrates. In this study, a complex mechanistic hydrodynamic-ecological model, coupled to a bioenergetics-based fish population model (DYCD-FISH), was employed with the aim of revealing IGP dynamics. The results indicate that the predation pressure of predatory zooplankton on herbivorous zooplankton varies widely, depending on the season. At the time of its annual peak, it is 10-20 times higher than the fish predation pressure. When the number of fish was significantly higher, as occurs in the lake after atypical meteorological years, the effect was a shift from a bottom-up controlled ecosystem, to the top-down control of planktivorous fish and a significant reduction of predatory and herbivorous zooplankton biomass. Yet, seasonally, the decrease in predatory-zooplankton biomass was followed by a decrease in their predation pressure on herbivorous zooplankton, leading to an increase of herbivorous zooplankton biomass to an extent similar to the base level. The analysis demonstrates the emergence of non-equilibrium IGP dynamics due to intra-annual and inter-annual changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the lake, and suggests that IGP dynamics should be considered in food web models in order to more accurately capture mass transfer and trophic interactions.

J	Basak, B; Alagha, O				Basak, Bertan; Alagha, Omar			Trace metals solubility in rainwater: evaluation of rainwater quality at a watershed area, Istanbul	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In this study, 79 bulk precipitation samples were collected at two sampling sites near Buyuk double dagger ekmece Lake, one of the important drinking water sources of Istanbul, for the period of October 2001 to July 2002. The study comprised the determination of trace and toxic metals concentrations in rain water. The concentrations of the metals in this study were found to be higher than those reported by other researchers around the world. The solubility of toxic metals was found in the order of Cd > Cu > V > Zn > Ni > Pb > Cr. Solubility of metals under acidic conditions (pH < 5.5) was approximately five times higher than those under neutral conditions with Cd as the most soluble metal (50% soluble). Statistical evaluations including seasonal variations, crustal enrichment factors, and correlation matrix were discussed to identify the possible sources of these pollutants. The study revealed that anthropogenic elements were highly enriched especially for Cd > Cu > Pb which were found to be highly enriched. Significant portion of Cu and Pb could be increased by the effect of local sources like cement industry in the area; however, the rest of the investigated trace metals could be brought to the sampling site by long-range transport to the Buyuk double dagger ekmece Lake watershed area.

Also, we investigated seasonal changes in nitrogen stable isotope ratios of phytoplankton and benthic microalgae in the strongly acidic lake, Lake Katanuma, which has only two dominant species, Pinnularia acidojaponica as a benthic diatom and Chlamydomonas acidophila, a planktonic green alga. From the published dataset, it may be concluded that delta C-13 of benthic diatoms were more enriched than those of phytoplankton at the same sites, although the nitrogen isotope of phytoplankton and benthic microalgae were similar. This differences in delta C-13 between benthic microalgae and phytoplankton could be explained by the boundary layer effect. On the other hand, nitrogen isotope values of both benthic microalgae and phytoplankton were primarily controlled by the same environmental factor, and boundary layer effects are not the primary factor determining the nitrogen isotope values of microalgae. Also, we showed temporal dynamics in nitrogen isotopes of benthic and planktonic microalgae species in Lake Katanuma, and the trends of nitrogen isotopes are similar between benthic and planktonic microalgae, as concluded from the published dataset.					; Doi, Hideyuki/D-2012-2010	Doi, Hideyuki/0000-0002-2701-3982; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2010	11	2					185	192		10.1007/s10201-009-0297-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-009-0297-1													WOS:000278932000011

This study aimed to predict the migration paths of Gymnocypris przewalskii at the river confluence in the Qinghai Lake basin. The authors proposed an approach for fish migration route prediction, which involves a hydrodynamic module, a habitat model and a fish migration module. The TELEMAC-MASCARET system was used to simulate hydrodynamic conditions and statistical analyses were carried out. During the flood season, G. przewalskii migrates downstream, whereas during the migratory season, they migrate upstream. The results indicate that flow velocity was the most significant hydrodynamic parameter affecting fish migration behaviour. The optimal flow velocity range for the target fish species was between 0.7 and 1.7 m/s. The impact of water depth was only observed in low discharge situations. Besides, the temperature plays a vital role in determining fish migration and abundance. However, the results reveal that in the morning hours, the temperature exhibits a range of 10 degrees C to 16 degrees C, and in the noon, the average temperature ranges from 16 degrees C to 19 degrees C, with a maximum temperature reaching 23 degrees C. These temperature variations enable fish to migrate towards the tributary offering a more favourable water temperature during route selection at a river confluence. The study concludes that future research should consider incorporating the swimming capacity of the focal fish species to provide insights into fish migration patterns.					; Yao, Weiwei/AFT-4956-2022	Giet, William Bol Yaak/0009-0004-7252-7933; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				DEC	2024	17	8								10.1002/eco.2724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2724		OCT 2024											WOS:001336549200001

The characteristics of these environments could favor diet overlap and therefore a high interspecific competition. This study described the dietary habits of chironomid genera, identified whether the dietary habits were specialized or generalist, and analyzed the diet overlap in the genera. Chironomidae larvae were collected from four lakes of the Chingaza paramo during the dry season, between April and May of 2 016. The feeding habits of larvae were evaluated by analyzing gut contents following standard methods. Each genus was assigned to trophic guilds (carnivore, detritivore and algivore) and the diet overlap was estimated using the Pianka's index. A total of 1 003 individuals were collected and nine genera were identified. Larvae consumed mainly fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), algae, macrophyte fragments, macroinvertebrates, and animal tissues. FPOM was the main feeding resource of detritivores. The analysis of diets showed a high affinity of each genus for a single trophic guild and most of the genera were generalist in the use of resources. For all lakes, high levels of diet overlap were observed among genera and trophic guilds, mainly among detritivores. Our results suggested that Chironomidae larvae of these lakes presented well differentiated trophic habits, and showed a moderate diet overlap within detritivores and carnivores.

Seasonal comparison of community-level size-spectra in southern coalfield streams of West Virginia (USA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Inverse scaling relationships between average body mass (M) and density (D) have been reported in many lake and marine ecosystems but are less well documented in lotic systems. We used quantitative samples of benthic macroinvertebrate and fish D to model the D versus M (i.e., D a 1/M) relationship in central Appalachian streams of the eastern USA. Specifically, we used the ataxic 'size-spectra' method (individuals identified only by size, not taxonomic identity, then aggregated within log(2) M bins) to model D as a function of M. Repeat samples were collected from three study streams in March, May, August, and October, allowing us to test for seasonal differences in the slopes and intercepts of size-spectra models, using linear mixed-effects modeling. Size-spectra slopes were significantly different among months, decreasing from March (slope = - 1.73) to May (- 1.81), then increasing to August (- 1.62) and October (- 1.65). Intercepts also differed among months but showed the opposite trend: intercepts increased from March (intercept = 0.51) to May (0.91), then decreased through August (0.44) and October (0.37). Size-spectra slopes and intercepts did not differ from the overall model parameters when estimated separately for macroinvertebrate and fish data. Finally, times series data on water temperature and discharge were used to show that size-spectra parameters may respond in predictable ways to the accumulation of degree days (i.e., the growing season) and to episodic flood events.

Research undertaken on Lake Tana in Ethiopia between 2009 and 2011 was intended to assess the seasonal threat from cyanobacteria and to select methods for tracking of this threat in the future. The cyanobacterial genus Microcystis was found to be present throughout the monitoring period, and M.aeruginosa was determined as the dominant species. Moreover, in all samples, toxigenic cyanobacteria with the potential to produce microcystins were detected. High levels of microcystins, ranging from 0.58 to 2.65gL(-1), were detected each November, which indicates that in the postrainy season, water usage should be limited. The correlation between concentrations of chlorophyll-a and microcystins suggested that chlorophyll-a could be used as an indicator of the potential presence of cyanobacterial-derived hepatotoxins in Lake Tana in the future. Furthermore, for quick quantitative confirmation of the presence of microcystins, a simple and rapid ELISA test was recommended.					; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/J-2427-2018	Jurczak, Tomasz/0000-0002-1576-6741; Zalewski, Maciej/0000-0002-4483-6200; Gagala-Borowska, Ilona/0000-0003-0123-7440; Mankiewicz-Boczek, Joanna/0000-0001-7358-0673; Urbaniak, Magdalena/0000-0001-5118-4530													0141-6707	1365-2028				MAR	2015	53	1					54	63		10.1111/aje.12170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.12170													WOS:000349913200007
J	Przyrowski, R; Schäfer, A				Przyrowski, Roman; Schaefer, Andreas			Quaternary fluvial basin of northern Upper Rhine Graben	ZEITSCHRIFT DER DEUTSCHEN GESELLSCHAFT FUR GEOWISSENSCHAFTEN												The Upper Rhine Graben is part of the European Cenozoic Rift System. The main phase of its rifting happened during the Oligocene and Miocene, continuing throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene. The northern Upper Rhine Graben is about 40 km wide and 150 km long, containing an up to 3500 m thick basin fill of Cenozoic sediments, unconformably resting on Mesozoic strata. The major part of the Cenozoic basin fill is of Tertiary marine to nearshore continental sediments. The Quaternary of the Upper Rhine Graben was formed as a fluvial basin containing sediments of Pleistocene to Holocene in age. As basin subsidence was accompanied by coeval uplift of the graben shoulders throughout the Cenozoic, the Pleistocene fluvial system has been confined to the today graben surface. This will be the focus of our study. Sands and muds of the fossil record within the Upper Rhine Graben show up in wells, which represent thickness and extent of the fluvial basin. The wells generally measure the entire Quaternary, mostly exposing the Pleistocene depositional record. Rapid fluvial transports had contributed coarse-grained sediments during times rich in melt water, whereas fine-grained suspensions had been trapped in numerous lakes that were interconnected and spread throughout the fluvial plain during stagnant times of the cold glacial season. Tentatively correlating the well profiles with the parent Quaternary stratigraphy of the Upper Rhine Graben, we work out a depositional model that is close to the historical view on the meander fluvial plain, once built by the Upper Rhine, Palaeo-Neckar, and Palaeo-Main rivers prior to 1804 when fundamental river course managements started to modify the natural environments.																			1860-1804	1861-4094				MAR	2015	166	1					71	98		10.1127/1860-1804/2014/0080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1860-1804/2014/0080													WOS:000352753400011

Here, we investigated the sources of carbon for Boeckella gracilipes (Copepoda, Calanoida) in three Patagonian shallow lakes that have different but relatively moderate DOM concentrations (<5 mg L-1). We linked their delta C-13 values with parameters such as water color (absorbance 440 nm, (abs440)), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and the ratio Color(abs440):Chlorophyll a (Chl a). We also determined the isotopic composition of seston and phytoplankton composition. Our results showed a direct relationship between the delta C-13 values of B. gracilipes and seston (r(2) = 0.64, P < 0.001), and we demonstrated the importance of phytoplankton to B. gracilipes as its delta C-13 signal was strongly related to the abundance of the mixotrophic nanoflagellate Chrysochromulina parva (r(2) = 0.86, P < 0.001). We further found an inverse relationship between DOM and the ratio Color(abs440): Chl a and B. gracilipes delta C-13 values (r(2) = 0.67 and 0.56, respectively), which also supported the importance of authochthonous carbon for the copepod. We conclude that phytoplankton, particularly mixotrophic algae, rather than allochthonous carbon, supports the copepod B. gracilipes in shallow Patagonian lakes.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019; Trochine, Carolina/AFU-8159-2022	Bastidas Navarro, Marcela/0000-0002-6558-0451; Trochine, Carolina/0000-0002-4844-1513; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR-APR	2015	37	2					441	451		10.1093/plankt/fbv005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbv005													WOS:000352487600015

This study measured the net photosynthetic assimilation rate (An), maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax), maximum electron transport rate (J(max)), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)) for CO2 of three plant functional types (PFTs, sedge, grass and shrub) and functional traits at different altitudes in the Qinghai Lake watershed during growing season. Meanwhile we simulated An of the PFTs under potential future scenario. Results indicate that grass maintain a relatively stable An by decreasing V-cmax, J(max), ratio of J(max) to V-cmax (J/V) and g(s), while slightly increasing g(m) with increasing altitudes. In contrast, the An of sedge and shrubs increased with rising V-cmax, J(max), g(s) and g(m) values, resulting in a large increment in the An at low altitudes. Grass was less sensitive to temperature by reducing the supply of CO2, while sedge and shrub increased. C-a was a more dominant factor than T-a in affecting the An of grass. The order of rising An in PFTs was shrub > sedge > grass, and the An of alpine meadow was found to increase more under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Our results indicate that grass may be more resistant to future warming and suggested that considering PFTs is of great significance for improving the simulating of the response of vegetation physiological and ecological processes to future climate change in alpine regions.					; Zhang, Cicheng/JKI-5065-2023; Li, Xiaoyan/K-8544-2012	wang, pei/0000-0002-8647-253X; Li, XiaoYan/0000-0002-7454-7821; Deng, Yujing/0009-0007-3441-7698; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				JAN	2023	16	1								10.1002/eco.2487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2487		OCT 2022											WOS:000868859100001

Assessing the potential health risk of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in Lake Naivasha, Kenya	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study discerned the causes of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Naivasha (Kenya). We hypothesized that phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass respond to hydrologic cycles, peaking during the wet season, and that microcystin (MC) concentrations are highest following the bloom collapse. Hydrologic loading (inferred from rainfall and lake level changes) and phytoplankton responses in two basins of the lake were monitored over a wet season followed by a dry season between September 2010 and March 2011. Results show that both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass peaked in both basins during the wet season, with associated peaks in particulate MC concentrations. Even though phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass were higher in the smaller deep basin, MC concentrations were lower than in the large shallow basin. The high-MC levels during the wet season were followed by a greater MC production per cyanobacteria biomass unit in the dry season in both basins. The timing of the cyanobacteria bloom suggests that its formation was likely controlled by large nutrient influxes from the contributing catchment to the lake associated with intense rainfall following an intense drought, posing a risk to the health of the community due to increased MC levels.

J	Panchen, ZA; Gorelick, R				Panchen, Zoe A.; Gorelick, Root			CANADIAN ARCTIC ARCHIPELAGO CONSPECIFICS FLOWER EARLIER IN THE HIGH ARCTIC THAN THE MID-ARCTIC	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES												Premise of research. The Canadian Arctic Archipelago is experiencing unprecedented climate change with temperatures rising at a rate that is twice the global average. The rapidly rising temperatures will likely impact plant phenology dramatically. The Canadian Arctic Archipelago is remote and difficult to reach, and there are few insights into the phenology of its plants. Data on current Arctic plant flowering times and how they vary across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are needed to form a baseline to facilitate studies on the impact of climate change on Arctic plant phenology. Methodology. We recorded the flowering times of 26 species from 12 families that are common to high-Arctic (lat. 81 degrees N) and mid-Artic (lat. 63 degrees N) locations in Nunavut, Canada, in 2013 and 2014. We compared differences in flowering times and flower abundance between the two locations and identified factors that might explain the differences. Pivotal results. Species flowered at the same time or earlier and for a shorter duration at the high-Arctic location than at the mid-Arctic location. Different sublocales at a location explained more of the variation in flowering time than did mid-versus high-Arctic location or elevation. Peak flowering occurred one-third of the way through flowering. Plants at the mid-Arctic location produced more flowers per plant than did plants at the high-Arctic location. Relative order of species' flowering is consistent between the mid-and high-Arctic locations and between years. Conclusions. Earlier flowering times of more northerly conspecifics are contrary to what might be expected given that temperatures are colder at the high-Arctic location than at the mid-Arctic location and that flowering time for a species is influenced by cumulative temperatures above a threshold. Our results suggest that plants at the northern location might be evolutionarily adapted to the shorter growing season and that plants have phenotypic plasticity across sublocales.																			1058-5893	1537-5315				OCT	2016	177	8					661	670		10.1086/687984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/687984													WOS:000385568200002

Contrasting but interconnecting metatranscriptome between large buoyant and small suspended particles during cyanobacterial blooming in the large shallow eutrophic Taihu Lake	WATER RESEARCH												Large cyanobacterial colonies as visible particles floating on the water surface provide different microbial niches from small particles suspended in the water column in eutrophic freshwaters. However, functional potential differences among microbes colonizing on these contrasting particles are not well understood. Here, the metatranscriptome of microbes inhabiting these two kinds of particles during cyanobacterial bloom (dominated by Microcystis spp.) was analyzed and compared. Community compositions of active bacteria associated with small suspended particles (SA, aggregates dominated by small cyanobacteria colonies, other algae and detritus, etc.) were much more diverse than those associated with large buoyant cyanobacterial colonies (LA), but functional diversity was not significantly different between them. Transcripts related to phosphorus and nitrogen metabolism from Proteobacteria, and respiration from Bacteroidetes were enriched in LA, whereas many more pathways such as photosynthesis from Cyanobacteria, cofactors, and protein metabolism from all dominant phyla were enriched in SA. Nevertheless, many transcripts were significantly correlated within and between LA and SA. These results indicated interconnection of bacteria between LA and SA. Moreover, many transcripts in SA were significantly correlated with transcripts from cyanobacterial phycobilisome in LA, indicating that bacterial metabolism in SA may influence cyanobacterial biomass in LA. Thus, the prediction of cyanobacterial blooms by bacterial activity in SA may be possible when there is no visible bloom on the water surface.

Large herbivores and aquatic-terrestrial links in southern boreal forests	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Concurrent measurement of population dynamics and associated spatio-temporal patterns of resource flow across aquatic-terrestrial boundaries are rare, yet necessary to understand the consequences of cross-habitat resource flux. Long-term study of the moose Alces alces (L.) population in Isle Royale National Park (Lake Superior, USA) provides an opportunity to examine the patterns of resource flux from aquatic to terrestrial habitats over 50 years. We analysed the spatio-temporal dynamics of aquatic-derived nitrogen (N) that moose transfer to terrestrial systems by using excretion models, foraging parameters, moose densities, and moose carcass locations (n = 3616) collected from 1958-2005. Results suggest that moose transfer significant amounts of aquatic-derived N to terrestrial systems, which likely increases terrestrial N availability in riparian zones. A seasonal increase in terrestrial N availability when moose are foraging on N-rich aquatic macrophytes would contrast with the depression of soil N mineralization previously attributed indirectly to moose. Aquatic foraging by moose and moose carcass locations are significantly clustered at multiple scales, indicating that grey wolves Canis lupus (L.) and moose can create concentrated areas of resource transfer due to clustered predation and foraging patterns. This study shows that patterns of faunal-mediated resource transfer can depend significantly on predator-prey dynamics, and that large predators in this system influence herbivore-controlled resource transfer between ecosystems. Given the circumpolar extent of moose, they constitute an important, unquantified aquatic-terrestrial resource vector in boreal systems.																			0021-8790					MAR	2009	78	2					338	345		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01498.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01498.x								19021781					WOS:000263038800006
J	Ito, E; Forester, RM				Ito, Emi; Forester, Richard M.			Changes in continental ostracode shell chemistry; uncertainty of cause	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ostracode shell chemistry is a powerful tool for recording changes of certain dissolved ions in their environment. Such data are commonly interpreted in terms of change in temperature and salinity, which are then used to offer insights into paleohydrology and from that paleoclimate. In particular, the changes in Sr/Ca-shell are believed to reflect changes in salinity, and the changes in Mg/Ca-shell to reflect both salinity and water temperature. However, the established application of this proxy too often ignores the complexities involved in the chemical changes accompanying solute evolution, hydrologic change, physical chemistry, and the autoecology and biology of ostracodes. Chemical changes occur: (1) in the dissolved Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios during solute evolution, (2) as a consequence of multiple sources of water, but especially ground and surface water interchange as well as evaporation, (3) as a consequence of different dissolved cation-anion pair formation at various concentrations, and (4) because of bio/ecologic effects, including seasonality of molting and taxa-specific ionic regulation capabilities. We suggest that changes in shell chemistry in a stratigraphic sequence tell us when changes occurred in the solutes, but cannot identify what caused those change(s) in the chemical environment. Inclusion of information from other paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic proxies that co-occur with ostracode shells may help to limit the choices amongst possible causes.

J	Kummu, M				Kummu, Matti			Water management in Angkor: Human impacts on hydrology and sediment transportation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The city of Angkor, capital of the Khmer empire from the 9th to 15th century CE, is well known for its impressive temples, but recent research has uncovered an extensive channel network stretching across over 1000 km(2). The channel network with large reservoirs (termed baray) formed the structure of the city and was the basis for its water management. The annual long dry season associated with the monsoon climate has challenged water management for centuries, and the extensive water management system must have played an important role in the mitigation of such marked seasonality. However, by changing the natural water courses with off-take channels the original catchments were also reshaped. Moreover, severe problems of erosion and sedimentation in human built channels evolved and impacted on the whole water management system. This paper describes the present hydrology of the area and discusses the impacts of water management on hydrology during the Angkor era. The paper, moreover, attempts to summarise lessons that could be learnt from Angkorian water management that might apply to present challenges within the field. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rains, MC; Fogg, GE; Harter, T; Dahlgren, RA; Williamson, RJ				Rains, MC; Fogg, GE; Harter, T; Dahlgren, RA; Williamson, RJ			The role of perched aquifers in hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical processes in vernal pool landscapes, Central Valley, California	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Relatively little is known about the role of perched aquifers in hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological processes of vernal pool landscapes. The objectives of this study are to introduce a perched aquifer concept for vernal pool formation and maintenance and to examine the resulting hydrological and biogeochemical phenomena in a representative catchment with three vernal pools connected to one another and to a seasonal stream by swales. A combined hydrometric and geochemical approach was used. Annual rainfall infiltrated but perched on a claypan/duripan, and this perched groundwater flowed downgradient toward the seasonal stream. The upper layer of soil above the claypan/duripan is similar to 0.6 m in thickness in the uplands and similar to 0.1 m in thickness in the vernal pools. Some groundwater flowed through the vernal pools when heads in the perched aquifer exceeded similar to 0.1 m above the claypan/duripan. Perched groundwater discharge accounted for 30-60% of the inflow to the vernal pools during and immediately following storm events. However, most perched groundwater flowed under or around the vernal pools or was recharged by annual rainfall downgradient of the vernal pools. Most of the perched groundwater was discharged to the outlet Swale immediately upgradient of the seasonal stream, and most water discharging from the outlet Swale to the seasonal stream was perched groundwater that had not flowed through the vernal pools. Therefore, nitrate-nitrogen concentrations were lower (e.g. 0.17 to 0.39 mg l(-1)) and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were higher (e.g. 5.97 to 3.24 mg l(-1)) in vernal pool water than in outlet Swale water discharging to the seasonal stream. Though the uplands, vernal pools, and seasonal stream are part of a single surface-water and perched groundwater system, the vernal pools apparently play a limited role in controlling landscape-scale water quality.

A comparison of parasites, pathological conditions and condition index of wild and farmed populations of Magallana bilineata (Roding, 1798) from Vembanad Lake, west coast of India	AQUACULTURE												This study forms the first attempt to assess the health status, studying parasites and pathologies in wild or natural and farmed or cultured populations of the Indian backwater oyster, Magallana bilineata (= Crassostrea madrasensis Preston, 1916), the mainstay of oyster farming in the country. The Condition index, prevalence of infection, intensity, and seasonal variations in parasites and pathological conditions were studied. Wild oyster population was infected/infested with protozoan (Perkinsus beihaiensis, Nematopsis sp., Sphenophrya sp., and Stegotricha sp.), metazoan (cestodes and crustaceans), and shell (Polydora spp. and Cliona spp.) parasites and pathological conditions (digestive tubule atrophy, ceroid bodies, haemocytic infiltration, tissue necrosis, neoplastic disorders, and prokaryotic inclusions). Farmed population exhibited only a single protozoan (P. beihaiensis), a metazoan (Polydora sp.) infection and two pathological conditions (digestive tubule atrophy and ceroid bodies) in the tissues. The occurrence, prevalence and intensity rates for parasites and pathological conditions were significantly lower in farmed population compared to the wild population at the study site. Prevalence for parasites and pathologies were observed to be higher during dry season. The condition index (CI) values, which indicate the general health status of the oysters, were also significantly higher for the farmed population. The exposure period and the location of oysters in the habitat had a significant influence on the condition index and parasitic load in the population. None of the parasites were OIE listed; however the presence of a potential pathogen (P. beihaiensis) and pathological conditions warrants regular monitoring of the stocks and water quality at the culture site.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												With absolute gravimetric observations from 2010 to 2013 in the southern Tibet, Chen et al. (2016) reported a gravity increase of up to 20 mu Gal/yr and concluded that it is possible if there was a density increase in a disk range of 580 km in diameter. Here we used observations from the gravity satellites Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) over 12 years to evaluate whether the model was practical, because a mass accumulation in such a large spatial range is well within the detectability ability of GRACE. The gravity trend based on their model is orders of magnitude larger than the GRACE observation, thus negating its conclusions. We then evaluated contributions from seasonal variation, lakes, glaciers, rivers, precipitation, and snowfall and concluded that these factors cannot cause such a large gravity signal. Finally, we discussed some possible explanations for the gravity increase of 40 mu Gal in two years.					; Yi, Shuang/AAK-6411-2021; Wang, Qiuyu/KVX-9763-2024	Wang, Qiuyu/0000-0002-4624-1489; Yi, Shuang/0000-0003-2976-2351; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 28	2016	43	4					1481	1486		10.1002/2015GL067509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067509													WOS:000373109000011

The dynamics and diversity of coexisting chemotypes are regarded as major factors influencing the microcystin-content of blooms of this potentially toxic cyanobacterial genus. We compared the chemotype composition in planktonic and benthic Microcystis communities in Brno reservoir (Czech Republic) from July to November 2004 by single-colony mass spectrometry (n = 783). Ninety-two peptides were selected to characterize 37 chemotypes as revealed by K-means clustering. In the course of the season the Microcystis community became significantly less diverse (linear regression of Shannon indices, p < 0.001) in the pelagic, and in November two chemotypes-both of which did not contain microcystins-accounted for nearly 80% of the colonies. In contrast, other chemotypes that were dominant in the pelagic in July were no longer encountered after August, whereas some chemotypes that never accounted for high relative abundances were encountered throughout the season. The shift to some few dominant chemotypes in the pelagic was also reflected by changes in the benthic community where the same chemotypes increased in relative abundances. Nonetheless, chemotypes were identified in the sediment in July and November that were never found in plankton samples. A principal component analysis revealed that communities in the pelagial and the benthal were very different in July but converged during the season because of the deposition of dominant planktonic chemotypes in the sediment. in accordance with the declining percentage of toxin-producing Microcystis colonies, the microcystin content of seston samples decreased significantly from 0.9 mg g(-1) dry weight to levels below the detection limit (linear regression, p < 0.001).					; Jarkovsky, Jiri/G-5494-2017; Welker, Martin/E-9795-2011; Šejnohová, Lenka/AAT-2759-2021	Marsalek, Blahoslav/0000-0002-5559-2723; Sejnohova, Lenka/0000-0002-8206-5873; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2007	52	2					609	619		10.4319/lo.2007.52.2.0609	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.2.0609													WOS:000245145200011

Temporal evolution of Pu and Cs sediment contamination in a seasonally stratified pond	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												There remains a lack of knowledge regarding ecosystem transfer, transport processes, and mechanisms, which influence the long-term mobility of Pu-239 and Cs-137 in natural environments. Monitoring the distribution and migration of trace radioisotopes as ecosystem tracers has the potential to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of geochemical cycles. This study investigated the distribution of anthropogenic radionuclides Pu-239 and Cs-137 along with total organic carbon, iron, and trace element in contaminated sediments of Pond B at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Pond B received reactor cooling water from 1961 to 1964, and trace amounts of Pu-239 and Cs-137 during operations. Our study collected sediment cores to determine concentrations of Pu-239, Cs-137, and major and minor elements in solid phase, pore water and an electrochemical method was used on wet cores to determine dissolved elemental concentrations. More than 50 years after deposition, Pu-239 and Cs-137 in sediments are primarily located in the upper 5 cm in area where deposition of particulate-bound contaminants was prevalent and located between 5 and 10 cm in areas of high sedimentation, showing a limited migration of Pu-239 and Cs-137. A Factor analysis demonstrated different sediment facies across the pond resulting in a range of geochemical processes controlling accumulation of Pu and Cs. Highest concentrations appear to be controlled by particulate input from the influent canal, dominated by clay, silt, and sand minerals bearing Fe. Elevated Pu-239 in the sediments were observed in areas with high organic matter and higher deposition rate relative to the Pond B system near the outlet indicating strong association of Pu with OM and particulates. Therefore, organic matter cycling likely plays a role in Pu redistribution between sediment and overlying pond water, and deposition in organic rich sediments accumulating near the outlet. Though Pu appears to have been distributed throughout the pond, Cs-137 concentrations remained the highest near the influent canal.

The concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon varied from one river to another and according to the season, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) always accounted for about 70% of the total organic carbon (TOC). The mean concentration of dissolved organic carbon was 6.1 mg l(-1) in the Madeira River, 5.83 mg l(-1) in the Solimoes River and 12.7 mg l(-1) in the Negro River. The percentage in weight of the particulate organic carbon decreased as the concentration of suspended matter increased. The Solimoes River contributed the most carbon to the Amazon River: about 500 kg C s(-1) during the high water period and about 300 kg C s(-1) during the low water period. However, the temporal variations in organic carbon in the Amazon River (i.e. downstream of Manaus) are basically controlled by inputs from the Negro River and its variations. The Negro River does not produce a simple dilution effect. During the high water period (between March and August) the TOC flux, calculated as the sum of the Solimoes, Negro and Madeira tributaries, was about 5.7 x 10(13) g C yr(-1), whereas during the low water period (between September and February) the TOC flux was about 2.6 x 10(13) g C yr(-1). The mean annual flux of TOC at Obidos (the final gauging station upstream of the estuary) was about 3.27 x 10(13) g C yr(-1) (i.e. 32.7 +/- 3.3 Tg yr(-1)). Of this, the flux of DOC represents about 2.7 x 10(13) g C yr(-1) and the flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) represents about 0.5 x 10(13) g C yr(-1). The mean annual input of TOC by all tributaries (Negro, Solimoes, Madeira, Trombetas, Tapajos and Xingu) was about 2.8 x 10(13) g C yr(-1). When we compared this input with the output recorded at Obidos (3.27 x 10(13) g C yr(-1)), we found that the amount of organic carbon increased (about 0.4 x 10(13) g C yr(-1)). This shows that other important sources of organic carbon exist in the lower reaches of the Amazon River. These inputs can be attributed to the adjacent floodplain lake system, called 'varzea'.

To promote sustainable growth of this population, managers need to understand how perturbation of vital rates will affect annual population growth rate (lambda). We developed a stage-based model representing the female mallard population in the Great Lakes using vital rates generated from a landscape-level study documenting reproductive parameters from 2001 to 2003. We conducted perturbation analyses (i.e., sensitivity analyses) to identify vital rates that most influence ?, and variance decomposition analyses to determine the proportion of variation in ?, explained by variation in each vital rate. Perturbation analyses indicated that lambda was most sensitive to changes in nonbreeding survival, duckling survival, and nest success. Therefore, changes in these vital rates would be expected to result in the greatest Delta lambda. Process variation in breeding season parameters accounted for 63% of variation in lambda. Breeding season parameters explaining the most variation were duckling survival (32%) and nest success (16%). Survival of adult females outside the breeding season accounted for 36% of variation in X. Harvest derivation, high harvest, and high sensitivity of ?, to nonbreeding survival for Great Lakes female mallards suggests there is a strong potential for managing the Great Lakes mallard population via harvest management. Because, was highly sensitive to changes in duckling survival, we suggest programs that emphasize wetland protection, enhancement, and restoration as a management strategy to improve population growth for breeding mallards.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JUL	2008	72	5					1181	1187		10.2193/2007-039	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2007-039													WOS:000257454100018

Brief Communication: Early season snowpack loss and implications for oversnow vehicle recreation travel planning	CRYOSPHERE												Oversnow vehicle recreation contributes to rural economies but requires a minimum snow depth to mitigate negative impacts on the environment. Daily snow water equivalent (SWE) observations from weather stations in the Lake Tahoe region (western USA) and a SWE reanalysis product are used to estimate the onset dates of SWE corresponding to similar to 30 cm in snow depth (SWEmin). Since 1985, median SWEmin onset has shifted later by approximately 2 weeks. Potential proximal causes of delayed onset are investigated; rainfall is increasing during October-January with dry days becoming warmer and more frequent.

However, the understanding of the long-term temporal variability of LGD remains limited owing to insufficient insights into driving mechanisms, such as climatic and hydrologic changes. In this study, we examined the oxbow lake group in the central Yangtze River (YR) and assessed the LGD rates from 2000 to 2022 using 222Rn combined with meteorological and hydrological data. The findings revealed that groundwater was recharged during the wet season and discharged to the lakes during the dry season. We established a mathematical model to link the LGD rates to the meteorological and hydrological factors of the lakes, which accounted for 98.70% of the LGD rate variance. Using a predictive model combined with meteorological and hydrological data to assess the LGD rate over the past two decades, it was found that in wet years with higher precipitation and higher average YR water levels, the LGD rate was higher. The gradual increase in precipitation during the rising water and wet seasons, along with a slow rise in the YR water levels, will cause the LGD rate to exhibit a slightly increasing trend with fluctuations in the future. This study proposed an innovative approach to investigate the long-term temporal variation in LGD and identify the weather and hydrological influences on LGD. Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) is an important water and substance source for lakes. However, long-term temporal variability of LGD is poorly understood due to limited knowledge of driving mechanisms such as climatic and hydrologic change. In this study, we focused on the oxbow lake group within central Yangtze River, and estimated LGD rates from 2000 to 2022 with meteorological and hydrological data. A mathematical model is established to correlate the LGD rates with meteorological and hydrological factors of the lakes. The simulated LGD rates in 2000-2022 show that the years with higher precipitation and higher water levels in the Yangtze River correspond to larger LGD rates. Additionally, future prediction suggests continuously increasing LGD rates. This study introduces an innovative approach to explore LGD's long-term temporal variability and identifies the regulation of weather and hydrology on LGD.

This study involves the statistical evaluation of water quality data for one hypersaline lake from Constanta District, Romania. Techirghiol Lake (located in South of Dobrogea Region, Romania) constitutes an ecosystem with a special morphological structure and an interesting geological past. The physico-chemical average parameters of Techirghiol Lake, registered in the period 1990 -2011) are described, analyzed and modelled. Techirghiol Lake had the highest salinity 66.14 gIL in 2009, pH values were in the interval 7.97-8.71 with low seasonal variations, indicating well buffered waters. The concentrations of some anions and cations varied as follows: Cl- - 738.87 meq/L (in 1997) - 1019 meq/L (in 2009), HCO2+ - 2.20 meq/L (ml 992) - 1019 meq/L (in 2009), Ca2+ - 8.53 meq/L (in 1993) - 20.43 meq/L (in 1992), Mg2+ - 171.05 meq/L (in 1993) -230.26 meq/L (in 1995), and the dried residue - 51.50 g/L (in 2006) - 65.32 g/L (in 2004). We also report the evolution of pollution indicators: dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand by potassium permanganate method (COD-Mn) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). The yearly averages of the quality parameters for all sampling sites ranged as follows: DO (mg/L) - 4.04 (in 2002) - 10.17 (in 2009); COD-Mn (mgO(2)/L) - 15.52 (in 1991) - 45.17 (in 1995); BOD5 (mgO(2)/L) - 2.78 (in 1993) - 20.25 (in 1995). Statistical analysis, including Kolmogorov-Smirnov [1], Levene [21, change points tests, Mann - Kendall test with Sen's slope [3, 4] calculation has been performed to evaluate the variation of statistical parameters.

Seasonal variation in the diet of juvenile lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, Rafinesque, 1817, in the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, is a threatened species across most of its range. To understand any potential shifts in diet across season or habitat, stomach contents were examined from juvenile lake sturgeon caught in the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada. This information will aid in assessment of environmental impacts and conservation initiatives for this threatened species. From 2006 to 2008 gut contents were collected from juvenile lake sturgeon using a non-lethal gastric lavage methodology. Juvenile lake sturgeon were sampled from four discrete deep water habitat types (13.7-27.4 m depths), during the months of May, June, July and October. In total, 13 066 prey items belonging to 14 prey groups were collected from 345 juvenile lake sturgeon (251-835 mm TL). Overall, juvenile lake sturgeon consumed a low diversity of organisms; insect larvae from three invertebrate orders, Trichoptera, Diptera and Ephemeroptera, accounted for 97.4% of the total numeric abundance of prey items recovered. A relationship between size of juvenile lake sturgeon and prey quantity or type was not observed. Diet of juvenile lake sturgeon varied in relation to season, with Diptera (77.6%) being the most abundant prey in May, Trichoptera the most abundant in June (n = 3,056, 60.4%) and July (n = 2,055, 52.6%). During October, 96% of stomachs examined were empty. In terms of habitat type, the standardized abundance of invertebrate prey items was highest in deep water habitats characterized by medium water velocity (depths > 13.7 m) and coarse substrate (particle sizes > 0.063 mm) in May and June when compared to deep water habitats characterized by low water velocity (<0.2 m.s(-1)) and fine substrate (particle sizes < 0.063 mm). However, in July, the opposite was observed and prey abundance in juvenile lake sturgeon stomachs decreased with increasing particle size. Results suggest a high degree of dietary overlap among juvenile lake sturgeon from multiple size/age classes occupying deep-water habitats of the Winnipeg River.

To advance understanding of these processes in dry environments and using additional microclimatic data, we examined the horizontal distribution, vertical stratification and abundance of epiphytic bromeliads in trees from a dry forest and tested whether water table depth (indicated by the distance to an exposed underground lake, cenote) influenced the microenvironment or structure of the vegetation. Seasonal microenvironmental variables (relative humidity, temperature and light) were characterized among sites, two tree species and three vertical canopy strata. Epiphytes and trees were surveyed in plots, and various tree traits were recorded. Epiphyte density decreased with distance from the cenote (water hole) as the water table became farther from the ground surface and thus unavailable to trees. Sites close to the cenote had higher nighttime humidity, irrespective of the tree species identity. Within the same tree species, the base of the canopy was lower at sites close to the cenote, denoting that the cenote influenced the structure of the canopy. These factors may determine the distribution of the epiphytes by positively influencing the water status of these nocturnally transpiring plants with Crassulacean acid metabolism. Epiphytes were distributed randomly among all the species of trees close to the cenote, but they exhibited a species-specific vertical stratification, which may reflect physiological differences among the epiphyte species.

J	Kitazawa, D; Yang, J				Kitazawa, Daisuke; Yang, Jing			Numerical analysis of water circulation and thermohaline structures in the Caspian Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The Caspian Sea has a unique ecosystem that consists of endemic species. The deterioration of the unique ecosystem has become increasingly worrisome since a wide variety of pollutants have been released into the water. Water circulation plays a key role in advection and diffusion of these pollutants. In the present study, water circulation and thermohaline structures in the Caspian Sea were analyzed by means of a three dimensional numerical simulation. The effects of meteorological changes, river inflow, and an icing event were taken into account as boundary conditions. Numerical simulation was carried out for 20 years to achieve stable seasonal variations in model variables. As a result, the horizontal distributions of water temperature and salinity could be reproduced; the gradient of water temperature in the north-south direction, the decrease in water temperature along the east coast of the middle Caspian Sea due to coastal upwelling, and low salinity in the northern Caspian Sea. The icing event kept the water temperature in the northern Caspian Sea from decreasing to an unrealistic value. The observed cyclonic gyres were basically formed by the density-driven current due to thermohaline structure.																			0948-4280					JUN	2012	17	2					168	180		10.1007/s00773-012-0159-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00773-012-0159-0													WOS:000305057500004

This study describes the current status of small fish community in Kuilei Lake (China), and examines the spatial and seasonal variations of the community in relation to key environmental factors. Based on submerged macrophyte cover and water depth, the lake was divided into five major habitats: (1) macrophyte covered shallow habitat of water depth < 2.00 m, (2) uncovered or less-covered shallow habitat (2.00 m-3.50 m), (3) uncovered medium shallow habitat (3.50 m-5.00 m), (4) uncovered medium deep habitat (5.00 m-6.50 m) and (5) uncovered deep habitat (6.50 m-8.50 m). The abundance and composition of small fish were monitored by benthic fykenet sampling from April 2013 to January 2014. A total of 2881 individuals belonging to 5 families and 21 species were collected. Based on their abundance (accounted for 88.96% of the total) and occurrence (more than 33.33%), Acheilognathus chankaensis, Acheilognathus macropterus, Microphysogobio mictvstomus, Pseudorasbora parva and Rhinogobius giurinus were recognized as dominant small fish species. The results of correlation analysis identified that species richness (Sr), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') and Margalefs richness index (D) were significantly negatively correlated with water depth, but positively correlated with biomass of submerged macrophytes.Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the spatial distributions of most small fishes were negatively associated with water depth. The details of these findings are beneficial to understanding the adaptation of the small fishes in degraded environments, and to developing suitable biomanipulation strategies for the management of fish resources and water quality in the lakes along the lower reach of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River basin.

J	Kocovsky, PM				Kocovsky, Patrick M.			Diets of endangered silver chub (Macrhybopsis storeriana, Kirtland, 1844) in Lake Erie and implications for recovery	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Silver chub (Macrhybopsis storeriana, Kirtland, 1844) is a native Cyprinid in Lake Erie, one of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. It is listed as endangered by the US state of New York and Canada, which has a recovery plan, and as special concern by the state of Michigan. Silver chub faces a potential threat to recovery from control efforts for invasive Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella, Valenciennes 1844). Among the knowledge gaps for protection and restoration is current diet data. I describe the diet of silver chub from western Lake Erie in 2014, and I compare it to past studies to assess changes in diet through time. Silver chub captured in bottom trawls May-September 2014 were frozen in the field, and stomach contents were preserved in ethanol. Diet taxa were identified to the lowest practical taxonomic unit, then dried and weighed. Frequency of occurrence in silver chub diets was highest for Hexagenia spp. mayflies (79%). Dreissena spp. and Hexagenia spp. were both 41% of the diet by dry weight. Analysis of delta C-13 isotopes identified Hexagenia spp. as the primary source of carbon in silver chub. Compared to past studies, Dreissena spp. have mostly replaced Sphaeriidae and Gastropoda in silver chub diets. There also have been seasonal shifts in relative amounts of shelled organisms and Hexagenia spp. This study and past research suggest a functional link between silver chub and Hexagenia spp. abundance. Maintenance and recovery of silver chub may be dependent on maintaining Hexagenia spp. populations.

Modern observations show that the ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has changed substantially, with obvious regional differences in vegetation composition, since the 1980s. Studying the history of vegetation succession and changes in the spatial distribution of vegetation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau can provide a scientific basis for accurate assessment and prediction of future changes. For this purpose, we selected Zeku Basin, in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The study area is open and flat and it belongs to the alpine and semi-humid climate zone with distinct seasonality. The annual average temperature ranges from -3-3 degrees C, and the annual precipitation ranges from 400-700 mm and is concentrated during June-September. The regional vegetation in Zeku Basin includes alpine meadow and alpine shrub, which is mainly composed of herbs and shrubs tolerant of cold and humid conditions. The alpine meadow is dominated by Kobresia and Carex, accompanied by Compositae, Ranunculaceae, Poaceae and Potentilla, which are mainly distributed in basin areas and on the sunlit slopes of the mountains. The alpine shrubs are dominated by Potentilla fruticosa, with occasional Hippophae and Spiraea alpina, mostly distributed on the shaded slopes of the mountains. The extent of the study area was determined according to the degree of vegetation regionalization with reference to Google satellite imagery of Qinghai Province. 31 representative sites were selected within the study area, using the random layout method. At each site surface moss samples were collected and a vegetation inventory conducted. We analyzed the pollen composition of the surface samples and determined the characteristics of the pollen assemblages and the pollen source area in alpine shrub meadow. The principal results are as follows: (1) The pollen assemblages are dominated by Cyperaceae (29.75%), Aster (21.86%), Ranunculaceae (16.99%), Rosaceae (7.84%) and Poaceae (5.1%), which mainly originate from the vegetation within 40 km of the sites (the proportion of total pollen loading reached was 83%). There is the minor representation of the pollen of arboreal plants, such as Betula, Pinus and Picea, which was wind-transported over long distances. The vegetation composition varied substantially between different sites within distances of 0-100 m of each site, resulting in a poor relationship with the pollen assemblages. However, the pollen assemblages and the vegetation composition were more similar over the distance of 0-3 km from each site, suggesting that the regionally-homogenized vegetation has a better relationship with the pollen assemblages. (2) We suggest that the surface pollen assemblages from lakes in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau may be greatly affected by extra-regional pollen or intrazonal vegetation in the shrub meadow. High percentages of Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae in pollen assemblages do not reflect the coverage of these taxa in the corresponding regional vegetation. Therefore, within shrub meadow environments of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, these taxa should be excluded from lake-sediment-based pollen studies of regional vegetation succession and climate change.

This nearly 1-year-long study aimed to understand the factors and mechanisms that cause temporal changes in the concentration of microbiological indicators and nutrient concentration in the grass carp pond water of Chongqing Jiguan Aquaculture Limited. The study was comprised of five sampling campaigns, with samples spaced 2 months apart. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH were measured in the field during sampling, and the concentration of nitrates, nitrites and phosphates were determined afterward in the laboratory. Subsequent analysis of 16s genome sequencing classified microorganisms into 32 phyla and 481 genera and revealed the core composition of the bacterial community for each season. Principal component analysis revealed that pathogens (Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium) are a significant negative correlation with water temperature and a positive correlation with ammonium concentration and dissolved oxygen. Bacillus and Streptomyces population size was negatively correlated with total phosphorus, while Lactobacillus and Bacteroides populations were positively correlated with water temperature and negatively correlated with ammonium salt. These findings reveal a significant relationship between microbial communities and the physicochemical parameters in aquaculture environments, providing a basis for further improving the aquaculture environment.					yao, wz/KIG-6274-2024														0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2019	34	1					123	133		10.1080/02705060.2019.1573203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2019.1573203													WOS:000459336600001

An analysis of predictability of ice phenomena in relation to stability and seasonality and an understanding mutual interactions between parameters describing ice regime of the lake. Material and methods Data from the Jagodne Male water gauge station on Jagodne Lake, concerning: the dates of the beginning and the end of ice phenomena, the beginning and the end of ice cover, and the thickness of ice cover from 1975-2015. Average monthly air temperature from the IMGW-PIB synoptic station in Mikolajki. Statistical analysis based on trend analysis using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the Colwell method. Results and conclusions The research has proven that Jagodne Lake shows some tendencies to change in ice regime over the last four decades. These trends should be identified with a successive shortening of ice season and a decrease of the thickness of ice cover. However, these changes in the case of the beginning and the end of ice phenomena (including ice cover) and the thickness of ice cover are not statistically significant. Only shortening of ice phenomena duration was observed and confirmed by the Mann-Kendall statistical test. The analyzed object reacts similarly to most of lakes, for which research on changes in icing was conducted. The observed increase of average temperatures in April had an influence on shortening of ice phenomena.					; Sojka, Mariusz/AFN-8790-2022; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015	Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686; Sojka, Mariusz/0000-0002-1453-0374; 													1644-0765						2019	18	1					89	100		10.15576/ASP.FC/2019.18.1.89	http://dx.doi.org/10.15576/ASP.FC/2019.18.1.89													WOS:000469814400008

There is insufficient knowledge regarding these factors in reservoirs, which limits the management of these areas. The aim of this study was to determine the diet of two related and most collected fish species, verify the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on their diet, and also verify the existence of resource sharing by them in an upstream Brazilian reservoir. Fish abundance in the reservoir was calculated and data were provided by 176 specimens of Iheringichthys labrosus (Laken, 1874) and 255 specimens of Pimelodus maculatus Lacepede, 1803 collected in Camargos reservoir, MG, Brazil. Stomach contents were analysed through the frequency of occurrence and volumetric methods. PERMANOVA analysis was done to evaluate the influence of biotic (Species and Size class) and abiotic factors (Season and Site) on the diets. The Alimentary Index (AI) and feeding overlap Index (Pianka) were also estimated. A NMDS analysis was conducted to visualize the food categories responsible for interspecific difference. The ingested items were grouped into 18 categories, of which 17 were found in both species. Feeding resources were significantly related to the biotic (Species: Pseudo F = 2.583, P = 0.001; Size Class: Pseudo F = 1.646, P = 0.001) and abiotic (Season: Pseudo F = 2.458, P = 0.006) factors. I. labrosus showed an invertivorous diet while P. maculatus an omnivorous diet and both species were not exclusively benthophagus as typically reported. Food overlap occurred intraspecifically and interspecifically (Pianka 0.61 to 0.97 and 0.61 to 0.66, respectively) and overlap also occurred in three of the four analysed seasons (Pianka 0.66 to 0.91). The diet overlap found between two of the most fished species and the low fish productivity may indicate the limitation of resources in this reservoir and should be considered for management of this area.

Heavy metals were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The metal distribution pattern was observed, where Zn and Cd could be considered as main metal contaminants. The variation in the concentration level of Zn and Cd in studied soils showed the impact of pollution from anthropogenic activities. Also some seasonal variations were visible among the suspended sediment and bottom sediment samples which could be associated with land agricultural practices or meteorological conditions. The sediment fingerprints approach used for determining sources of the suspension in the catchment showed (Kruskal-Wallis H test, p<0.05), that only Mn and Ni were not able to be distinguished among the potential sediment sources. A multiple linear regression model described the relationship between suspended sediment and 4 types of soil samples. The results related suspended composition mostly to the samples from the residential land use. Considering the contemporary trend of observed changes in land use resulting in conversion of agricultural areas into residential and service structures these changes can be essential for the contamination of aquatic environment. This situation is a warning sign due to the rapid industrialization, urbanization and intensive agriculture in this region what can significantly affect the drinking water quality.

The results showed that the PH3 flux at the water-air interface ranged from -69.9 +/- 29.7 to 121 +/- 42 ng m(-2) h(-1), with a mean flux of 14.4 +/- 22.5 ng m(-2) h(-1). The fluxes were both negative and positive during the diurnal period, indicating that the lake can act as a sink and a source of PH3. In addition, the PH3 fluxes were positively correlated with water temperature, total soluble phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus, while they were negatively correlated with water redox potential. A similar diurnal variation curve of atmospheric PH3 concentrations was observed during all four seasons, with the maximum level occurring in early morning and the minimum appearing around midday. These findings suggest that light plays an important role in the elimination of atmospheric PH3. A significant positive correlation was also found between air temperature and atmospheric PH3 concentration. The mean flux of PH3 in Lake Taihu was higher than in other reported wetlands, with an estimated annual emission of PH3 to the atmosphere of 2.94 x 10(5) g y(-1). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Horppila, J; Nurminen, L				Horppila, J; Nurminen, L			Effects of different macrophyte growth forms on sediment and P resuspension in a shallow lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The effects of floating-leaved, submerged and emergent macrophytes on sediment resuspension and internal phosphorus loading were studied in the shallow Kirkkojarvi basin by placing sedimentation traps among different plant beds and adjacent open water and by sediment and water samples. All the three life forms considerably reduced sediment resuspension compared with non-vegetated areas. Both among submerged (Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton obtusifolius, Ranunculus circinatus) and emergent (Typha angustifolia) plants, resuspension rate was on average 43% of that in the adjacent open water, while within floating-leaved plants (Nuphar lutea) the corresponding value was 87%. The effects of submerged and emergent vegetation increased in the course of the growing season together with increasing plant density. Among floating-leaved vegetation, such seasonal trend in resuspension effects was not observed. Compared with the non-vegetated area, floating-leaved, submerged and emergent plants reduced internal phosphorus loading on average by 21, 12 and 26 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The effects of floating-leaved plants on resuspension-mediated internal phosphosrus loading were thus comparable to the effects of the other two life forms.																			0018-8158					AUG 15	2005	545						167	175		10.1007/s10750-005-2677-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-2677-9													WOS:000231958700014
J	Taylor, AH				Taylor, AH			Identifying forest reference conditions on early cut-over lands, Lake Tahoe Basin, USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Pre-Euro-American settlement forest structure and fire regimes for Jeffrey pine-white fir, red fir-western white pine, and lodgepole pine forests in the Lake Tahoe Basin (California and Nevada, USA) were identified using stand structural analysis and fire scars based on measurements of stumps of trees that were cut in the 19th century. Comparisons of the presettlement reference with contemporary conditions were then used to determine how and why contemporary conditions deviate from presettlement conditions and to guide ecological restoration. Contemporary forests varied in different ways compared to the presettlement reference. Contemporary Jeffrey pine-white fir forests have more and smaller trees, more basal area, less structural variability, and trees with a more clumped spatial distribution than presettlement forests. The mean presettlement fire-return interval for Jeffrey pine-white fir forests was 11.4 yr, and most (>90%) fires burned in the dormant season; no fire was recorded in the study area after 1871. Similar differences were identified in the structural characteristics of contemporary and presettlement red fir-western white pine and lodgepole pine forests. However, 19th-century logging changed the composition of red fir-western white pine forests, and these forests now have more lodgepole pine than red fir or western white pine. Comparison of contemporary forests with the presettlement reference suggests that restoration treatments in Jeffrey pine-white fir forests should include: (1) density and basal-area reduction, primarily of smaller diameter trees; (2) reintroduction of frequent fire as a key regulating disturbance process; and (3) increasing structural heterogeneity by shifting clumped tree distributions to a more random pattern. Restoration treatments in red fir-western white pine forests should include: (1) a shift in species composition by a density and basal-area reduction of lodgepole pine; and (2) increasing structural heterogeneity by shifting tree distributions to a more random pattern. In lodgepole pine forests the restoration emphasis should be: (1) a density and basal-area reduction of small-diameter trees; and (2) an increase in structural heterogeneity that shifts tree spatial patterns from clumped to a more random distribution. Reintroduction of fire as a regulating process into high-elevation red fir-western white pine and lodgepole pine forests can be viewed as a longer-term restoration goal. The method for quantifying presettlement reference conditions from stumps complements, or is an alternative to, methods based on dendroecology or repeat photography.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				DEC	2004	14	6					1903	1920		10.1890/02-5257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-5257													WOS:000225858000023

DNA and RNA were isolated from size fractionated samples and the diversity of the bacteria present in each fraction was studied by PCR amplification of partial 16S rRNA and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting. Major bands from the gels were sequenced for further identification. Cyanobacteria were also identified and counted under the rnicroscope. Anabaena/Aphanizomenon were the most abundant cyanobacteria in both years, although the dominant species was different each year. When comparing the 2 techniques, equal numbers of abundant Anabaena/Aphanizomen on morphotypes were detected by microscopy and phylotypes by DGGE. The genera Microcystis and Synechococcus appeared more abundant in the DGGE analysis than under the microscope. In the heterotrophic bacterial community variation was observed between the bloom samples from the 2 years. Verrucomicrobia was the most abundant group in both years in both DNA- and RNA-derived profiles. Otherwise the patterns based on DNA and RNA-derived DGGE-profiles differed, especially in 2002. The presence of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi was less pronounced in RNA-based than in DNA-based analysis. This indicates that their relative biomass was smaller than estimated by DNA-analysis. It might also indicate that they were metabolically inactive. In contrast, in 2002, the CFB group (Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides) and delta-Proteobacteria were more prominent in the RNA-based than in the DNA-based profiles. Thus they probably formed a substantial fraction of biomass and/or were active members in the blooms.

Cylindrical sedimentation traps were placed at six locations including emergent aquatic vegetation stands (Phragmites australis), submerged vegetations stands (Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton pectinatus and Potamogeton perfoliatus) and unvegetated shallow (1-1.5 m) areas. During the study period (19 May-29 September 2009, sampling interval of two weeks), there was a seasonal development of macrophyte stands, as well as variation in suspended matter and sediment resuspension. The resuspension-inhibiting effect of macrophytes was found as decreasing resuspension values in concordance with the increasing macrophyte density during the growing season. However, measured phosphorus resuspension was highest among emergent macrophytes due to high concentration of phosphorus in sediments. A linear regression model for resuspension in shallow coastal areas was developed with which sediment resuspension rate may be predicted.

Occurrence and significance of a cold-water carbonate pseudomorph in microbialites from a saline lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Micron-scale pseudomorphs of calcite after ikaite were discovered in microbialites from Manito Lake, a large hypersaline lake in the Great Plains of western Canada. Although environmental conditions in the lakes of this region (seasonally cold temperatures, high salinities and elevated productivity) suggest that ikaite should be common, this is the first documentation of lacustrine ikaite in Canada and the Great Plains region of North America. The calcite pseudomorphs form a porous dendritic fabric, comprise the interiors of massive shoreline microbialite mounds and pinnacles, and are encased in centimeter-scale, laminated dolomite-aragonite rinds. Because of the limited thermodynamic stability of ikaite at or near freezing temperatures, the psuedomorphs of this mineral provide evidence of an extended cold episode during the first millennium AD. The Manito deposits also show high delta C-13 values, indicating elevated productivity and delta O-18 signatures are consistent with precipitation in a cold, somewhat fresher lake than present.

Plio-Pleistocene facies environments from the KBS Member, Koobi Fora Formation: implications for climate controls on the development of lake-margin hominin habitats in the northeast Turkana Basin (northwest Kenya)	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												Climate change is hypothesized as a cause of major events of Plio-Pleistocene East African hominin evolution, but the vertically discontinuous and laterally confined nature of the relevant geological records has led to difficulties with assessing probable links between the two. High-resolution sedimentary sequences from lacustrine settings can provide comprehensive data of environmental changes and detailed correlations with well-established orbital and marine records of climate. Hominin-bearing deposits from Koobi Fora Ridge localities in the northeast Turkana Basin of Kenya are an archive of Plio-Pleistocene lake-margin sedimentation though significant developmental junctures of northern African climates, East African environments, and hominin evolution. This study examines alluvial channel and floodplain, nearshore lacustrine, and offshore lacustrine facies environments for the approximately 136-m-thick KBS Member (Koobi Fora Formation) exposed at the Koobi Fora Ridge. Aspects of the facies environments record information on the changing hydrosedimentary dynamics of the lake margin and give insights into potential climatic controls. Seasonal/yearly climate changes are represented by the varve-like laminations in offshore mudstones and the slickensides, dish-shaped fractures, and other paleosol features overprinted on floodplain strata. Vertical shifts between facies environments, however, are interpreted to indicate lake-level fluctuations deriving from longer-term, dry-wet periods in monsoonal rainfall. Recurrence periods for the inferred lake-level changes range from about 10,000 to 50,000 years, and several are consistent with the average estimated timescales of orbital precession (similar to 20,000 years) and obliquity (similar to 40,000 years). KBS Member facies environments from the Koobi Fora Ridge document the development of lake-margin hominin habitats in the northeast Turkana Basin. Environmental changes in these habitats may be a result of monsoonal rainfall variations that derive from orbital insolation and/or glacial forcing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Trend identification in twentieth-century US snowfall: The challenges	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												There is an increasing interest in examining long-term trends in measures of snow climatology. An examination of the U. S. daily snowfall records for 1900-2004 revealed numerous apparent inconsistencies. For example, long-term snowfall trends among neighboring lake-effect stations differ greatly from insignificant to +100% century(-1). Internal inconsistencies in the snow records, such as a lack of upward trends in maximum seasonal snow depth at stations with large upward trends in snowfall, point to inhomogeneities. Nationwide, the frequency of daily observations with a 10:1 snowfall-to-liquid- equivalent ratio declined from 30% in the 1930s to a current value of around 10%, a change that is clearly due to observational practice. There then must be biases in cold-season liquid-equivalent precipitation, or snowfall, or both. An empirical adjustment of snow-event, liquid-equivalent precipitation indicates that the potential biases can be statistically significant. Examples from this study show that there are nonclimatic issues that complicate the identification of and significantly change the trends in snow variables. Thus, great care should be taken in interpretation of time series of snow-related variables from the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) network. Furthermore, full documentation of optional practices should be required of network observers so that future users of these data can properly account for such practices.

Effects of upstream lakes on dissolved organic matter in streams	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined the effects of upstream lakes on dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and the absorbance of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the streams of northern Michigan. We assessed DOM concentration and absorbance in 15 streams with upstream lakes and 17 streams without upstream lakes located in the same geographic region in May and August 2003. In addition, we estimated watershed land cover and morphology to assess the possibility that other landscape variables could account for DOM differences between the two stream types. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon, its UVB absorbance, and its molar absorbtivity (absorbance per unit carbon) were all significantly lower in streams with upstream lakes than in streams with no lakes. Strong predictive relationships existed between upstream watershed metrics and stream DOM properties, but varied by season and the presence of upstream lakes. DOM quantity and UV-absorbing ability were related to different watershed metrics, with DOM quantity being strongly related to terrestrial watershed metrics, whereas UV-absorbing ability was most strongly related to percent water surface area. Upstream lakes strongly influence downstream DOM potentially because of their long water residence times, which could increase opportunities for DOM processing. Upstream lakes represent a strong landscape predictor of stream DOM properties that is not directly tied to terrestrial DOM sources and processing.					; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021; Zheng, Zhiyu/LIA-9638-2024; Bridgham, Scott/R-1557-2017; Lodge, David/AAX-1781-2021	Johnston, Carol/0000-0002-9663-5048; Larson, James/0000-0002-6414-9758; 													0024-3590					JAN	2007	52	1					60	69		10.4319/lo.2007.52.1.0060	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.1.0060													WOS:000243795400006

Quaternary environmental history and agricultural impact on vegetation in Central America	ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN					51st Annual Systematics Symposium of the Missouri-Botanical-Garden	OCT 08-10, 2004	St Louis, MO	Missouri Bot Garden				The corpus of historical data from lake sediments relating to the climate, vegetation, and human land use of the lowland Central American tropical forest between ca. 20,000 BP and the time of European contact is reviewed. Pollen, phytolith, and charcoal records identify the distribution and composition of tropical vegetation and fire patterns during the late Pleistocene, when they were significantly altered from today's, and earliest Holocene, when plant communities reassembled and interglacial representatives began to coalesce on the landscape. The significance of the environmental perturbations that occurred during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene for human occupation of the lowland tropical forest and the geography and chronology of agricultural origins is discussed. Fire was employed by hunters and gatherers and farmers alike during the past 11,000 years as a primary tool of forest modification. The profound effects of an ancient pre-Columbian development of plant food production and, subsequently, slash and burn agriculture between ca. 10,000 BP and 4000 BP can be seen on lowland forests from Mexico to the Amazon Basin.																			0026-6493	2162-4372					2006	93	2					274	296		10.3417/0026-6493(2006)93[274:QEHAAI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3417/0026-6493(2006)93[274:QEHAAI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000240071400007
J	Stuart, IG; Jones, M				Stuart, IG; Jones, M			Large, regulated forest floodplain is an ideal recruitment zone for non-native common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Non- native common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) are the most abundant large-bodied fish in the Murray Darling Basin. The abundance of common carp larvae and young-of-the-year appears to increase after flooding, although the relative contribution of floodplain habitats compared to riverine areas remains unresolved. Larval nets were used monthly from September 2000 to January 2001 to identify common carp spawning and recruitment areas in the regulated Murray River and floodplain around the Barmah-Millewa forest. Five non-native and five native fish species comprising 136 111 individuals were collected, with common carp constituting 88% of the overall catch. Less than 1% of common carp, however, originated from the Murray River upstream of the Barmah-Millewa floodplain. Consequently, this floodplain appears to be a major source of common carp recruitment in the mid-Murray area. Conversely, eggs from large-bodied native fish were only present in the Murray River and not the Barmah floodplain. There are opportunities for common carp control in this area, to potentially reduce populations in a wider river reach. Implementation of common carp control measures in the Barmah-Millewa floodplain should be further investigated, particularly with regard to seasonal irrigation flows, obligatory migration routes and in the timing of future large-scale environmental water allocations.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2006	57	3					333	347		10.1071/MF05035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF05035													WOS:000237136200011

Methods The investigation was carried out from July 2004 to May 2005 in Boeng Cheung Ek lake, a main recipient of wastewater from the city of Phnom Penh. Water spinach samples were collected near two wastewater entry points in the northern part of the lake and near a wastewater exit point in the southern part of the lake, where water is discharged from the lake into a stream. Water spinach samples were harvested at each of the three locations with and without wastewater contact according to the normal practices of farmers, and analysed for ThC, protozoan parasites (Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora), and helminth eggs (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichura and hookworm) using standard methods. Wastewater samples were also collected at each of the three locations and analysed for ThC and helminth eggs. Results High concentrations of ThC (approximately 10(5)-10(7)/g) were found in water spinach samples. ThC mean counts did not differ significantly, neither between sample types at each location, nor between locations. ThC mean concentration of water spinach samples collected in the rainy season of 2005 was higher than that in the dry season of 2004. Protozoan parasites were detected in the samples from all three locations and in water spinach harvested with and without wastewater contact. Giardia spp. were present in 56% (20) of samples with an average cyst concentration of 6.6/g. Mean counts of Giardia were not significantly associated with wastewater contact status of water spinach. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 17% (six) of samples with an average concentration of 0.5 oocyst per gram of water spinach. Cyclospora oocysts were detected in 8% (three) of samples. Four (11%) water spinach samples contained helminth eggs (average concentration: 0.1 egg per gram). Water samples contained approximately 10(4)-10(7) ThC per 100 ml and a mean of 27.4 helminth eggs per litre. There was a 2-3 log reduction of ThC between the water samples collected at the wastewater entry and exit point(s) of the lake. Conclusions Water spinach cultivated in the lake was highly contaminated with feces, as indicated by high ThC concentrations and the presence of protozoan parasites. A reduction in ThC numbers almost to WHO guideline levels for irrigation water occurred through natural biological and physical processes in the lake, as shown by differences in ThC counts at wastewater entry and exit points.

It is also the only extant aquatic mammal in the Yangtze River. In this study, 44 sampling points were deployed across the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with vertical sampling sections established in four key areas. Using environmental DNA (eDNA) and species distribution model (SDM), we explored the spatiotemporal distribution of YFPs and predicted their potential suitable habitats. The results indicate that the YFP has a relatively wide distribution during the flood season but exhibits clustering behavior during the dry season, showing a patchy distribution and a migratory trend from the midstream to downstream of the main channel. Predictions using the MAXENT model reveal varying trends in suitable habitat under different scenarios. Overall, YFP's potential habitat is expected to expand by 2050, but due to rising temperatures, it will contract by 2070. Elevation (dem, 65.4%), human footprint index (hfp, 8.8%), and isothermality (bio3, 8%) are key factors influencing habitat suitability. These findings demonstrate that eDNA is an effective tool for monitoring large aquatic organisms and provide scientific evidence for the conservation of the YFP.

Modeling of plankton community dynamics characterized by algal toxicity and allelopathy: A focus on historical Prymnesium parvum blooms in a Texas reservoir	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A model is formulated to explore the dynamics of the harmful alga Prymnesium parvum, in a reservoir typical of those in the south-central U.S. where fish-killing blooms of this species frequently occur. Based on a previous model of growth in a well-mixed system, P. parvum competes for nutrients with cyanobacteria, which also excrete allelopathic cyanotoxin(s) that inhibit the growth of P. parvum. A new feature added here is a population of small-bodied zooplankton grazing on both types of algae, with the grazing rate on P. parvum inhibited by dissolved toxin(s) excreted by this species. In contrast to previous models that did not produce convincing calibrations, the new model is successfully calibrated using one year of forcing data on hydraulic flow, water temperature, salinity and nutrient supply from Lake Granbury, Texas. The calibrated model successfully reproduces the seasonal dynamics of P. parvum. Both allelopathy from cyanobacteria and toxic inhibition of grazers are necessary for fitting the calibration data, and produce dynamics in which blooms of P. parvum occur at low temperatures, below those optimal for growth. Long-term historical simulations of the new, calibrated model predict the observed occurrence of P. parvum blooms in cool weather, and suggest that low water flows during the late 1980s and early 2000s predisposed reservoirs to having such blooms. Respectively, these time periods correspond to the first known fish kills due to P. parvum in Texas, and to a series of annually recurrent blooms in several reservoirs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

WATER												Although sources of seston are much more complicated in lakes compared to oceans, the influences of different sources on the spatiotemporal variations in seston stoichiometry are still underexplored, especially in large eutrophic floodplain lakes. Here, we investigated seston stoichiometric ratios across a typical large eutrophic floodplain lake (Lake Taihu, East China) over one year. In addition, we used the n-alkane proxies to examine the influence of the seston source on seston stoichiometry variation. Throughout the study, the average value of the C:N:P ratio of 143:19:1 across Lake Taihu was close to the canonical lake's ratios (166:20:1). Similar to other eutrophic lakes, seston C:N ratios varied the least across all environments, but C:P and N:P ratios varied widely and showed a strong decreasing trend in ratios of N:P and C:P from growing season to senescence season. This seasonal change was mainly associated with the decreasing contribution from algal-derived materials in seston pools because the non-algal dominated seston exhibited significantly lower ratios than algal-dominated seston. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of stoichiometric ratios was also related to the seston source. During the senescence season, the terrestrial-dominated seston from agricultural watershed exhibited the lowest ratios in estuary sites compared with other areas. Statistically, the predictive power of environmental variables on stoichiometric ratios was strongly improved by adding n-alkanes proxies. Apart from source indicators, particulate phosphorus (PP) contents also partly explained the spatiotemporal variations in stoichiometric ratios. This study, thus, highlights the utility of multiple-combined n-alkane proxies in addition to simple C:N ratios to get more robust source information, which is essential for interpreting the spatiotemporal variations in seston stoichiometric ratios among eutrophic floodplain lakes and other freshwater ecosystems.					; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021; Jiang, Xingyu/AGB-8636-2022; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021	Cai, Jian/0000-0001-7987-3338; Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004; Dai, Jiangyu/0000-0002-8605-1022														2073-4441				JAN	2020	12	1							36	10.3390/w12010036	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010036													WOS:000519847200036

Chi-square test (chi(2)) confirmed that the male to female sex ratio was 1:0.93 which was not significantly different from hypothetical ratio of 1:1. The maximum numbers of stage IV gonads were encountered during the month of June indicated its spawning period. Mass and length ratio showed a negative allometric growth (b<3) in males (2.08102), females (2.50212) and for the sexes pooled (2.25371). The maximum and minimum values of condition factor for both the sexes of M. aculeatus were recorded during non-breeding and breeding seasons respectively. The ova diameter of ripe eggs of M. aculeatus ranged between 1.25-1.40 mm during the month of June while the single mean peak value (male = 1.40 +/- 0.091; female = 4.49 +/- 0.059) of the gonado-somatic index pointed out that the fish has only one breeding season during monsoon. Absolute fecundity varied from 800 to 1510, with an average value of 1247 eggs. Fecundity was found to be highly correlated with the total length (r = 0.9041), body weight (r = 0.8901), ovary length (r = 0.8721) and ovary weight (r 0.9210) which were found to be significant (p<0.001).																			0970-6011						2020	67	2					15	22		10.21077/ijf.2019.67.2.94362-03	http://dx.doi.org/10.21077/ijf.2019.67.2.94362-03													WOS:000545797700003

Material and methods A number of field measurements were made, i.e. thickness of bottom sediments, light transmission, and physicochemical analyses of waters. Activities undertaken in the bioremediation process were described. The final effects have been characterised. Results and conclusions The microbiological bioremediation process has contributed to the reduction of bottom sediments (organic fractions) by 30-100% at the selected measuring points. There was an improvement in the euphotic zone conditions from 70-100% in the examined points. The level of organic pollutants in water has also partially improved. The concentrations of the studied nutrients did not decrease, and even in some points they increased in 2018. Despite visible changes in the water quality in the reservoir, and almost complete elimination of organic fractions in bottom sediments, an increase in nutrients in the flood waters could be expected. In the last year of research, complete elimination of algal blooms was noted and ecotones were located in places of their earlier occurrence. The reservoir is still exposed to pressure from pollutants brought in by waters of the Zadrna River. If sources of pollution are not eliminated, this type of treatment will have to be repeated in subsequent seasons to maintain the quality of the reservoir water.

J	Ökse, AT				Okse, A. Tuba			Upper Tigris Region - Settlement History of the Ambar Cay Valley	OLBA												The Ambar Dam, which is established in the Kocakoy District of Diyarbakir, will affect three mounds. Salvage excavations carried out in 2018 provide important data on the settlement history of the upper basin of Ambar Cayi. The soundings on the eastern skirt of Ambar IRV& brought out four levels of Medieval architecture. The material recovered from the soil agglomerated from the mound is dated to the Pottery Neolithic Period, the Middle Bronze Age, the New Assyrian period and Middle Ages. The settlement in Gre Filla (Ambar I) had begun in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, and continued during the Neolithic period, and Kendale Hecala had been inhabited during the Pottery Neolithic period. Both mounds have been resettled in the Medieval Period.A "crested blade" and a "Byblos point" recovered among the surface soil in Gre Filla date the earliest inhabitancy of the region in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B. "Early Mineral Tempered Ware" and "Dark Faced Burnished Ware", being produced in the 7th millennium BC, are numerous in all mounds. The "Light Coloured Straw Tempered" and "Dark Faced Burnished" pots produced in the Early Pottery Neolithic witnessed a continuous settlement in Gre Fula. The sherds belonging to light coloured bowls decorated with incisions and red paint belong to the "Hassuna Pottery". "Husking Tray" fragments were also found together with these groups. In all three mounds, several sherds of the Halafian Painted Pottery, produced in the Late Neolithic Period have been found in all three mounds. In Kendale Hecala, Dark Faced Burnished Ware and painted vessels reflecting the characteristics of the early phase have been detected. Middle Halafian sherds have been identified in all mounds, and a Late Halafian sherd in Gre Filla. All three mounds seem to have been abandoned after the Neolithic Age. The sherds dating to the Early Bronze Age IV, Middle Bronze Age, New Assyrian period and the Roman period have only been recovered in Ambar Hoyuk. All mounds provide sherds belonging to coarse common ware, unglazed moulded vessels with relief decoration, and green glazed pots dating to the 11th-14th centuries. An area of 2 km in radius around Ambar Hoyuk is a high agricultural area with deep water in the southern half, where Gre Filla and Kendale Hecala are located, and is suitable for rain-fed agriculture and animal grazing in the northern half. All three mounds have been inhabited during the Neolithic period, suggesting these being very close to each other, as small scattered fanner settlements connected to each other. The same is also true for the Middle Ages. The pot sherds dated to the Byzantine, Islamic and Seljuk periods show the same characteristics in all three mounds. According to the "Site Catchment Area" and "Site Territorial Area" analysis, the obsidian residues on the surface of all mounds indicate these to be located in the distribution area of the resources to the west of Solhan district of Bingol. Ambar valley is a natural route leading to one of the most suitable mountain passages between the main trade route of Northern Mesopotamia and the raw material resources in the Taurus range, and nomadic pastoralists still use this route during seasonal migrations.

Implications of Climate Change for Northern Canada: The Physical Environment	AMBIO												The physical environment of the Canadian North is particularly sensitive to changes in climate because of a large concentration of cryospheric elements including both seasonal and multiyear forms of freshwater and sea ice, permafrost, snow, glaciers, and small ice caps. Because the cryosphere responds directly to changes in air temperature and precipitation, it is a primary indicator of the effects of climate variability and change. This article reviews the major changes that have occurred in the recent historical record of these cryospheric components at high latitudes in Canada. Some changes have been less pronounced in the Canadian North than elsewhere, such as changes in sea-ice coverage, whereas others have been potentially more significant, such as ablation of the extensive alpine and high-Arctic small glaciers and ice caps. Projections of future changes are also reviewed for each cryospheric component. Discussion about two other physical components of the North intrinsically linked to the cryosphere is also included, specifically: i) freshwater discharge to the Arctic Ocean via major river networks that are fed primarily by various forms of snow and ice, and ii) the related rise in sea level, which is strongly influenced by ablation of the cryosphere, and coastal stability, which also depends on the thermal integrity of coastal permafrost.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				JUL	2009	38	5			SI		266	271		10.1579/0044-7447-38.5.266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1579/0044-7447-38.5.266								19714959					WOS:000268360100005

Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans in the Atmosphere Around the Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The atmospheric concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs were measured in four sites near the shores of the North American Great Lakes. The sites included an urban site (Chicago, Illinois) and three rural/remote sites (Eagle Harbor, Michigan; Sleeping Bear Dunes, Michigan; and Sturgeon Point, New York). Sampling occurred every 24 days between November 2004 and December 2007. The concentration of PCDD/Fs averaged 2.3 +/- 0.2 fg WHO TEQ/m(3) at Eagle Harbor, 35 +/- 3 fg WHO TEQ/m(3) at Chicago, 7.4 +/- 1.4 fg WHO TEO/m3 at Sleeping Bear Dunes, and 13 +/- 2 fg WHO TEQ/m(3) at Sturgeon Point The total concentration of the 17 toxic PCDD/F congeners showed a significant seasonal trend at all sites, except Chicago. The date of maximum concentration averaged Dec 6 +/- 35 days, which is consistent with residential heating being an important source of PCDD/Fs to the atmosphere. A significant positive relationship between the logarithm of the total concentration of the 17 toxic PCDD/F congeners and the logarithm of the number of people within a 25 km radius around the sampling site was found. We suggest that urban and industrial areas, which are heavily populated, act as sources of PCDDs and PCDFs to the atmosphere.

The intensive hydrocarbon exploitation (Val d'Agri oilfield) makes this area also affected by induced seismicity. In this HAV sector, the injection of salt-water in an unproductive disposal well (Costa Molina 2) causes localized swarms of microearthquakes; a second cluster of continuous induced seismicity is also observed SW of the Pertusillo Lake and it is associated to the seasonal fluctuations of the reservoir's water level. The major insight inferred from this study concerns a better understanding of the geological and tectonic framework in the HAV. The electrical resistivity model images the subsurface as conductive sedimentary sequences (Allochthonous Units) upon the carbonate Apulian Platform Unit characterized by higher resistivity values. Both these units appear composed of thrust-and-fold system deepening with larger wavelength anticlines N-E toward. Most of the structures identified in the magnetotelluric model are rather superficial and confined within the Allochthonous Units. A sudden break of the Apulian platform under the central part of the MT profile defines a conductive zone possibly associated to a major SW-dipping reverse fault or to several branches, as closely spaced thrust-sheets cutting eastern flanks of the Agri Valley. Additional information on the HAV deep structures comes from the joint interpretation of the resistivity model and a 3D seismic tomographic model obtained from the inversion of passive seismic data collected in the period 2002-2018. The availability of this elastic representation of the subsurface allowed us to perform a cluster analysis on the electrical resistivity and seismic P-wave velocity distribution within the subsoil. This joint quantitative interpretation unveiled new insights, otherwise hidden by individual models, on the subsurface structure distinguishing some rheological zones in terms of barriers and asperities.

J	Lang, GA				Lang, Gregory A.			High Tunnel Tree Fruit Production: The Final Frontier?	HORTTECHNOLOGY					Colloquium on High Tunnels held at the ASHS Annual Conference	JUL 19, 2007	Scottsdale, AZ	ASHS Commercial Hort Extens Working Grp				High tunnel production systems typically use horticultural crops that are annually or biennially herbaceous, high in value, short in stature, and quick to produce. At best, tree fruits may fit only one of these criteria-high value. Sweet cherry (Prunus avium) may command high enough values in premium market niches to make high tunnel production strategies worth attempting. Furthermore, sweet cherry production can be a risky endeavor, even in optimal climates, due to the potentially devastating effects of preharvest rain that cause fruit cracking. Consequently, environmental modification by tunnels in regions like the Great Lakes provides a significant risk reduction. Additional potential benefits, such as protection from frosts, diseases, insects, wind scarring, etc., add further production value. Multi-bay high tunnels were constructed in 2005 at two Michigan State University experiment stations, over established and newly planted sweet cherry trees on dwarfing rootstocks, to study and optimize the effects of production environment modification on vegetative and reproductive growth, marketing season extension, and protection of cherries from diseases, insect pests, and/or physiological disorders. Results with tunnels thus far include premium fruit quality and high crop value; increased leaf size and terminal shoot growth; decreased radial trunk growth; decreased chemical pesticide inputs; decreased incidence of cherry leaf spot (Blumeriella jaapii) and bacterial canker (Pseudomonas syringae); increased incidence of powdery mildew (Podosphaera clandestina); inconclusive effects on brown rot (Monolinia fructicola); no or reduced infestation by plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar) or cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis cingulata); dramatically reduced japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) damage; and increased black cherry aphid (Myzus cerasi) and two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) populations.																			1063-0198	1943-7714				JAN-MAR	2009	19	1					50	55		10.21273/HORTSCI.19.1.50	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI.19.1.50													WOS:000261873200011

However, its provenance and behaviour within the snow remain uncertain. We describe two investigations tracing upward brine movement in snow: one conducted in the laboratory and one in the field. The laboratory experiments involved the addition of dyed brine to the base of terrestrial snow samples, with subsequent wicking being measured. Our field experiment involved dye being added directly (without brine) to bare sea-ice and lake ice surfaces, with snow then accumulating on top over several days. On the sea ice, the dye migrated upwards into the snow by up to 5 cm as the snow's basal layer became more salty, whereas no migration occurred in our control experiment over non-saline lake ice. This occurred in relatively dry snowpacks where brine took up $< 6\%$ of the snow's calculated pore volume, suggesting pore saturation is not required for upward salt transport. Our results highlight the potential role of microstructural parameters beyond those currently retrievable with penetrometry, and the potential value of longitudinal, process-based field studies of young snowpacks.					; Stroeve, Julienne/ABE-7227-2020; Saha, Monojit/ADK-7299-2022; Nandan, Vishnu/W-5164-2017; Willatt, Rosemary/HTN-4931-2023	Mallett, Robbie/0000-0002-1069-6529; Stroeve, Julienne/0000-0001-7316-8320; wilkinson, jeremy/0000-0002-7166-3042; Veyssiere, Gaelle/0000-0003-4843-4935; Willatt, Rosemary/0000-0003-2512-562X; Saha, Monojit/0000-0002-2249-1205													0260-3055	1727-5644				SEP 19	2024	65									10.1017/aog.2024.27	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aog.2024.27		SEP 2024											WOS:001316636200001

Effect of seasonal flooding cycle on litterfall production in alluvial rainforest on the middle Xingu River (Amazon basin, Brazil)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The assumption for this study was that litterfall in floodplain environments of the middle Xingu river follows a pattern of seasonal variation. According to this view, litterfall production (total and fractions) was estimated in four alluvial rainforest sites on the middle Xingu River over an annual cycle, and examined the effect of seasonal flooding cycle. The sites included two marginal flooded forests of insular lakes (Ilha Grande and Pimentel) and two flooded forests on the banks of the Xingu itself (Boa Esperanca and Arroz Cru). Total litterfall correlated with rainfall and river levels, but whereas the leaf and fruit fractions followed this general pattern, the flower fraction presented an inverse pattern, peaking in the dry season. The litterfall patterns recorded in the present study were consistent with those recorded at other Amazonian sites, and in some other tropical ecosystems.

The data period comprises more than half of the open-water period of 2013. The 30-min averages of CO2 fluxes ranged from -0.02 to 0.05 mg m(-2) s(-1). The monthly CO2 balances varied from 20 to 30 g m(-2) (emission) between July and September, and decreased in October. A small daytime uptake of CO2, probably caused by the aquatic plants growing near the measurement mast, was observed from July to September. In September, we observed a temporary enhancement of CO2 efflux, which was attributed to both high wind speed and rapid cooling of the water and subsequent water column overturn. This peak was accompanied by a period of high sensible heat flux (SHF) from the water to the atmosphere, which is known to enhance the mixing of the water. The seasonal CO2 flux during the open-water period from the shallow part of the lake was estimated to be 120 g m(-2) yri, which corresponds to a loss of approximately 25 g m(-2) yr(-1) from the terrestrial part of the catchment, assuming that the observed lake CO2 emissions result from the decomposition of the imported carbon. At midday, the net energy received by the lake was used mostly to heat the water, and only a minor part of it was converted to SHF and latent heat flux (LHF), with more energy used for the latter. While the SHF showed a clear diurnal cycle with a peak early in the morning and no flux in the afternoon, the diurnal pattern of LHF was more even, with evaporation occurring throughout the day until the freezing of the lake. Our data from this northern lake highlight the importance of thermal water mixing in the air lake CO2 flux dynamics and imply that this flux constitutes a significant part of the annual catchment-scale carbon budget.

Across all sites, concentrations of Sigma BDEs in individual samples ranged from 9.2 to 171.5 pg L-1, with an average of 61.9 pg L-1. Notwithstanding the far greater use of the Penta-BDE commercial formulation in the USA, concentrations in this study are comparable to the limited data available for the Great Lakes. PBDE concentrations showed no evidence of a decline at any monitored location over the study period. This may be because this study commenced 4 years after the introduction of restrictions on the Penta- and Octa-BDE formulations. While concentrations normalised to water volume at the different locations were statistically indistinguishable; significant spatial variation was apparent when the data were normalised to total suspended solids (TSS) content. However, this spatial variation was not correlated with factors such as population density and lake catchment area, suggesting that concentrations of PBDEs in lake water in this study are a complex integral of numerous factors. BDE-47:99 ratios and concentrations of Sigma BDEs respectively decreased and increased significantly with increasing TSS content. As TSS content was elevated in colder compared with warmer periods, such seasonal variation in TSS content appears a major contributor to the observed elevation of Sigma BDE concentrations in colder periods, and higher BDE-47:99 ratios in warmer periods.

Attenuation of in situ UV radiation in Mackenzie Delta lakes with varying dissolved organic matter compositions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In 2004, ultraviolet-B (UVB) and ultraviolet-A (UVA) attenuation were measured in Mackenzie Delta lakes spanning gradients in water renewal rate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition. DOM compositions (ratio of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) to non-chromophoric DOM) in Delta lakes are complex, evolving seasonally via flooding, dilution, macrophyte production, photobleaching, and bacterial metabolism. Attenuation was more strongly related to CDOM absorption coefficients (a(330); UVB r(2) = 0.69, p < 0.0001; UVA r(2) = 0.58, p < 0.0001) than to DOC concentrations due to variable DOM compositions. Attenuation in one set of lakes was well related (linear models) to a330 and total suspended solids (UVB R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.0001; UVA R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.0001). When these models were applied to other Delta lakes, however, attenuation of UVB was overestimated in 17 of 19 cases and attenuation of UVA was overestimated in all 18 cases. This bias indicates that models are not transferrable among Delta lakes, and likely cannot be applied in other circumpolar delta lakes with similarly complex DOM compositions. Although attenuation is high in Delta lakes (KdUVB 17.1-33.4 m(-1); K(d)UVA 7.7-19.2 m(-1)), plankton and photoreactive solutes may be exposed to high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) because Delta lakes are shallow, UVB and UVA penetrate the top 19% and 31% of water columns, respectively, and day lengths are extended during open water. Thus, climate change effects on DOM compositions may significantly alter in situ UVR environments in circumpolar delta lakes.

Part I: Observations and context	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												One of the rainiest areas on earth, the Panama Bight and Pacific (western) littoral of Colombia, is the focal point for a regional modeling study utilizing the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) with nested grids. In this first of three parts, the observed climatology of the region is presented. The seasonal march of rainfall has a northwest-southeast axis, with western Colombia near the center, receiving rain throughout the year. This study focuses on the August-September season. The diurnal cycle of rainfall over land exhibits an afternoon maximum over most of South and Central America, typically composed of relatively small convective cloud systems. Over some large valleys in the Andes, and over Lake Maracaibo, a nocturnal maximum of rainfall is observed. A strong night/morning maximum of rainfall prevails over the coastal ocean, propagating offshore and westward with time. This offshore convection often takes the form of mesoscale convective systems with sizes comparable to the region's coastal concavities and other geographical features. The 10-day period of these model studies (28 August-7 September 1998) is shown to be a period of unusually active weather, but with a time-mean rainfall pattern similar to longer-term climatology. It is concluded that the rain-producing processes during this time period are likely to be typical of those that shape the seasonal climatology.

The investigation was performed in the surface waters of two small brackish ponds (Ganzirri and Faro), located in the Cape Peloro transitional area (Sicily, Italy). The seasonal changes in both the microbial compartment [bacterioplankton, vibrios, exoenzymatic hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides, bacterial secondary production (HBP) and community respiration] and the trophic state of suspended matter [total suspended matter (TSM), particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), C/N] were analysed in relation to the hydrological characteristics [temperature, salinity, oxygen, fluorescence, NH4, NO2, NO3, PO4]. Despite marked differences in the nutritional input and the diversification in both carbon budget and trophic level, the two ponds show similar trends in many of the investigated factors, hardly influenced by seasonal variations. Temporally coupled trends were observed for some parameters (enzyme activities, vibrios abundances, respiratory activity), whereas others (POC, PON, heterotrophic bacterial production, bacterioplankton) showed a seasonal shift between the two lakes. The different behaviour found for the some biotic parameters suggests that their response to environmental conditions may be modulated differently between the two lakes, which, despite their spatial proximity and reciprocal connection, do not always show contemporaneous functional processes.					azzaro, Maurizio/AAE-6784-2019; Raffa, Francesco/C-9576-2016; Zaccone, Renata/C-9884-2012; azzaro, maurizio/A-9559-2017; mancuso, monique/AAD-7109-2019; Caruso, Gabriella/F-5450-2013	Raffa, Francesco/0000-0002-0990-8846; Zaccone, Renata/0000-0002-0151-9416; azzaro, maurizio/0000-0001-7885-2340; la ferla, rosabruna/0000-0003-1029-7349; Leonardi, Marcella/0000-0002-8763-6073; AZZARO, FILIPPO/0000-0002-5194-3856; Caruso, Gabriella/0000-0002-3819-5486; mancuso, monique/0000-0003-3252-0572													0173-9565	1439-0485				OCT	2009	30			1			33	42		10.1111/j.1439-0485.2009.00320.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0485.2009.00320.x													WOS:000270237100004

Anthropogenic activity and structures have varying effects on the activity of carnivores in a protected area in Wisconsin, United States	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												While protected areas are often considered strongholds for wildlife populations, recent research in protected areas has highlighted that both human activity (i.e. presence) and footprint (i.e. structures) can influence wildlife. To determine how human activity and structures affect the spatiotemporal activity of wildlife on the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Wisconsin, United States, we monitored the carnivore community for 5 years (2014-2018) using camera traps. We found that lighthouses had a negative impact on carnivore community richness, while historical sites had a positive impact. Responses of individual carnivore species to anthropogenic structures varied depending on structure type, with most of the canids and mustelids exhibiting negative associations with campgrounds. When examining the seasonal effects of human activity and footprint (i.e., when park visitation is relatively high or low), we found that carnivore richness was lower during the high human activity season, suggesting that seasonal variation in human activity influences carnivore activity. We also compared carnivore nocturnality along a gradient of anthropogenic activity, but our results indicate that the carnivore community did not become more nocturnal with increasing anthropogenic activity as expected. However, the carnivore community did display spatial avoidance of current anthropogenic structures, especially campgrounds. Our study indicates that human footprint in the form of structures and seasonal variation in human activity can influence wildlife activity within protected areas. Based on this study, species-specific research that includes multiple representations of potential human effects (i.e., including categories of human footprint and activity) will allow for a more nuanced and cohesive understanding of the impacts of humans on the spatial and temporal distributions of wildlife species.

Several short-term episodes of decreased moisture availability as a result of low eastern equatorial Atlantic SST are suggested by planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios. These episodes promoted a weakening of the AMS and thus determined the timing and intensity of arid periods. Local sea-surface salinities also reveal regional patterns of precipitation in equatorial western Africa. The high eastern equatorial Atlantic SSTs occur in concert with seasonally increased insolation at low latitudes, suggesting a strong response of African monsoonal precipitation to oceanic conditions at low latitudes.

TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To assess establishment success of a heavily exploited population of non-native gibel carp Carassius gibelio, biological traits and population structure of the species from a large eutrophic lake (Lake Uluabat, Turkey) were investigated from June 2009 to May 2010 and attributes were compared with the published information from the introduced and native range. Commercial harvesting of gibel carp did not seem to affect population size and viability of gibe! carp in Lake Uluabat but it had one of the slowest growth rate represented by twelve age groups, and its life span was one of the longest recorded for the populations both in its natural and introduced areas. The reproductive season lasted from March to early May. Size at maturity was earlier and relative fecundity was higher than those in the introduced range. Higher investment in reproduction displayed by earlier maturation, higher relative fecundity and gonadosomatic index with gynogenetic spawning in Lake Uluabat is likely to be the key factor for establishment success of gibel carp.

EDAPHIC INFLUENCES ON TREE SPECIES COMPOSITION AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN A TROPICAL WATERSHED FOREST IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE												A study was conducted to determine tree species composition and community structure, and their relationships with edaphic factors at a watershed forest in Tasik Chini, Peninsular Malaysia. Thirty plots of 0.1 ha were established with a total sampling area of 1.4 ha in inland forest, 0.9 ha in seasonal flood forest and 0.7 ha in riverine forest. A total of 3974 trees with diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 5.0 cm were recorded. The inland forest recorded 2061 individuals representing 393 species from 164 genera and 57 families; the seasonal flood forest had 1019 individuals representing 268 species from 137 genera and 57 families; and the riverine forest had 894 individuals representing 260 species from 137 genera and 53 families. Endospermum diadenum (Euphorbiaceae) was the most important species in the inland forest with importance value index (SW) of 3.36%, Streblus elongatus (Moraceae) in the seasonal flood forest with SIVi of 4.43% and Aporusa arborea (Euphorbiaceae) in the riverine forest with SIVi of 2.96%. The pH values of all three types of forest soils were acidic, with readings between 4.0 and 4.1. The highest average organic matter was in the inland forest (9.30%), followed by the riverine forest (8.49%) and seasonal flood forest (7.84%). The highest available P and K were in the riverine forest with values of 14.27 +/- 1.23 and 175.88 +/- 27.95 meq/100 g respectively. Ordinations using can' onical correspondence analysis showed that the relationships between tree community and soil properties were weakly associated (p > 0.05). However, there were some species that were highly correlated with soil chemical characteristics and organic matter content.

We hypothesized that specific bacterial groups which rapidly respond to changes in DOC availability might form large populations in such habitats. Seasonal changes of microbial community composition were studied in two compartments of an artificially divided bog lake with contrasting DOC inputs. These changes were compared to community shifts induced during short-term enrichment experiments. Inocula from the two compartments were diluted 1:10 into water from the more DOC-rich compartment, and inorganic nutrients were added to avoid microbial N and P limitation. The dilutions were incubated for a period of 2 weeks. The microbial assemblages were analyzed by cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and by fluorescence in situ hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes. beta-Proteobacteria from a cosmopolitan freshwater lineage related to Polynucleobacter necessarius (beta II) were rapidly enriched in all treatments. In contrast, members of the class Actinobacteria did not respond to the enhanced availability of DOC by an immediate increase in growth rate, and their relative abundances declined during the incubations. In lake water members of the beta II clade seasonally constituted up to 50% of all microbes in the water column. Bacteria from this lineage annually formed a significantly higher fraction of the microbial community in the lake compartment with a higher allochthonous influx than in the other compartment. Actinobacteria represented a second numerically important bacterioplankton group, but without clear differences between the compartments. We suggest that the pelagic microbial community of the studied system harbors two major components with fundamentally different growth strategies.

As the second largest freshwater lake in China, Dongting Lake is the most important regulating lake in the Yangtze River Basin because it has extensive flood storage capacity. The dynamic characteristics of its circulation and sediment transport are significantly affected by the scheduling and interception of control reservoirs at the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. In this paper, a central lake reservoir is proposed to improve the flood and drought resistance of Dongting Lake. The efficiency of the central lake reservoir is investigated numerically by developing a two-dimensional shallow water model. We demonstrate that current velocity and water elevation during flood and drought events can be influenced significantly by the construction of the central lake reservoir. The flood storage capacity of the central lake reservoir can reduce the peak flood elevation significantly in West Dongting Lake, which would enhance its flood resistance. The water replenishment of the central lake reservoir in the dry season can also efficiently increase the lake water elevation to enhance the drought resistance in the area surrounding the lake. Our findings have important implications for policy makers and their management of Dongting Lake.

Given the increasing interest in the potential importance of CH4 flux, we employed Illumine Miseq pyrosequencing to examine the effect of lake shrinkage (in a lake that had decreased from 3.7 km(2) to 3.0 km(2) in area during the last 20 years) on the community abundance, activity and structure of methane-cycling microorganisms under four types of soils during lake recession: SEDIMENT (the sediment of the lake, at the maximum depth of 6 m), SLOPE (soil at a lake water depth of 0.6 m), MARSH (the seasonally flooded marsh and wetland formed after recession of the lake) and MEADOW (the meadow formed after recession of the lake, about 200 m from the lake). The results showed that lake shrinkage decreased the relative abundance and transcripts of soil methanogens and methanotrophs along the gradient from SEDIMENT to SLOPE to MARSH. MEADOW, having the longest drying time, had both higher soil nutrient concentrations (including dissolved organic carbon, total carbon and total nitrogen), and higher relative abundance of 16S rRNA genes and transcripts of methanogens and methanotrophs. Results of methanogen community structure analysis indicated 'resistance' to change under lake shrinkage, with all communities dominated by Methanosaetaceae except the SLOPE community, which was dominated by Methanoregulaceae, while the dominant methanotroph changed from Methylomicrobium (a Type I methanotroph) (in SEDIMENT, SLOPE and MARSH) to Methylocaldum (Type I) and Methylosinus (Type II) (in MEADow) under lake shrinkage. Taken together, the microbial community data indicate that CH4 production and consumption potentially recedes under lake shrinkage, whereas the formation of MEADOW may increase CH4 emission and oxidization potential.

J	Crookshanks, S; Gilbert, R				Crookshanks, Sarah; Gilbert, Robert			Continuous, diurnally fluctuating turbidity currents in Kluane Lake, Yukon Territory	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Modern sedimentary processes were studied in Kluane Lake, Yukon Territory, to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of sediment distribution in a large, dynamic, glacier-fed lake. Data from a river monitoring station, moored instruments, sediment traps, and water-column profiles in the lake were used to document lacustrine sedimentary processes in 2006 and 2007. During the peak melt season, the suspended sediment concentration of Slims River is weakly dependent on river discharge and can reach up to 5 g L-1, although a diurnal range between 1 and 2 g L-1 is more commonly observed. The high suspended sediment load in the river generates continuous, diurnally fluctuating turbidity currents in Kluane Lake with maximum velocities up to 0.6 m s(-1). During times of peak flow, variations in velocity can be traced to beyond 4 km from the river mouth. The vertical concentration profiles, mass accumulation rates, and suspended sediment loads show distinctive longitudinal variations; the highest rate of accumulation occurs similar to 1 km from the point of inflow, which is concurrent with a distinct change in flow structure. Diurnal laminations are apparent in sediment traps close to the point of inflow and can be directly linked to variations in current velocity; however, these laminations do not occur consistently over space or time. These results suggest that long-term measurement records of lacustrine turbidity currents provide valuable insights regarding the multiple scales of environmental variability and have important implications for paleoenvironmental reconstruction using lacustrine sediments.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				OCT	2008	45	10					1123	1138		10.1139/E08-058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E08-058													WOS:000261908400004

BP in the French Massif Central. This paper focuses on the palaeoecological reconstruction of environmental and climatic changes affecting this shallow periglacial lake from the Late-Glacial to the Early Holocene. After field surveys and geophysical mapping, two cores (cores A and D) were extracted and dated. Plant macrofossils, pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) and diatom assemblages were compared within the cores to study vegetation, temperature, pH, water level and ice cover changes through time. During the Oldest Dryas (18-14.75 ka cal. BP), climatic conditions were the coldest with a short ice-free season allowing the development of periphytic diatoms only (ecologically comparable to Arctic ones). A cold and dry steppe landscape - exposed to severe erosion - comprised an herbaceous and shrub flora (e.g. Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Helianthemum, Ephedra, Hippophae center dot, Juniperus). Animal presence is suggested by coprophilous fungi. Periphytic diatoms and allochtonous pollen (Cedrus) underline windy conditions, and the possible erosion of neo-formed soils. Then, during the Bolling-Allerod interstadial (14.75-12.7 ka cal. BP), the ice-free season increased and some trees/ shrubs (Salix, Betula and Juniperus) established locally within open grasslands. During the Younger Dryas (12.7-11.7 ka cal. BP) cooler conditions favoured steppe taxa again (Helianthemum, Achillea, Artemisia, Car-yophyllaceae, Ranunculaceae) and erosion increased. The ice cover on the lake prevailed even if the conditions were not as cold as during the Oldest Dryas. During the Preboreal (11.7-10 ka cal. BP) Isoe center dot tes echinospora and I. lacustris developed in the eulittoral zone of the lake, which was surrounded by a swamp forest (with Betula nana and B. pubescens). Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula, Corylus avellana and trees from the Quercetum mixtum rapidly established in the uplands. Occurrences of Gaeumannomyces and Xylomyces fungi - both phytopathogens on broadleaved trees - and decreasing herb values indirectly hint at a close forest canopy. At the beginning of the Boreal (10 ka cal. BP), aquatic and semi-aquatic taxa developed on open water due to longer ice-free seasons (diatoms, micro-algae, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Potamogeton, Typha). The final terrestrialization towards a mire occurred as a consequence of the Holocene warming and related to water chemistry changes (acidification, eutrophication).

The results of processing a series of 82 Landsat images are used to assess the seasonal variability of suspended sediment balance in the Selenga delta in period from 1989 up to the present time. It is shown that, at higher water discharges (> 1500 m(3)/s), suspended material will accumulate in the delta (on the average 15% of the total sediment transport at the delta head), governed by material precipitation within inundated floodplain area and lakes in the lower part of the delta. At lower water discharges (< 1500 m(3)/s), a longitudinal increase in suspended sediment transport may take place, caused by setups from Baikal side and channel erosion in the branches.

Park			The first Cenozoic spinicaudatans from North America	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY												A new spinicaudatan species, Estherites? jocelynae new species, is described from more than fifty specimens collected from the Medicine Lodge Formation (early Oligocene) of the Beaverhead Basin in southwestern Montana, USA. This is the first spinicaudatan species reported from Cenozoic strata of North America and is the second-youngest fossil clam shrimp described globally. The new species extends the range of the superfamily Estheriteoidea into the Paleogene. Carapaces of E.? jocelynae n. sp. are preserved as a calcium carbonate replacement of the original chitin-calcium-phosphate structure, which is an uncommon style of preservation for spinicaudatans. The unique preservation coupled with the range extension suggests that the sparse Cenozoic fossil record of spinicaudatans may be partly attributable to preservation bias related to geochemical conditions rather than exclusively to diversity decline following the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. The presence of E.? jocelynae n. sp. in the Medicine Lodge Formation indicates that lakes in the Beaverhead Basin experienced seasonality and fluctuating lake levels with at least some drying at the lake margins. The ecological inferences support previous paleoenvironmental interpretations based on paleobotanical and other faunal evidence.

However, little is known about the effect of temperature increased at first and then decreased with the season change on the P flux rate and flux amount at the sediment-water interface in the steppe wetlands. The effects of the temperature variation on P flux at the sediment-water interface in the steppe wetlands during the vegetation growing season under simulated wetland habitat were studied. The results showed that the release of P from sediments to overlying water was greatly affected by temperature changes. When the temperature rose, P was released from the sediment into the overlying water, while P was precipitated from the water into the sediment with the temperature dropped. During simulation period, the total P in water flux rates between sediment and overlying water (FP) was ranged from - 4.51 to 4.99 mg.m(-2).day(-1), while the dissolved reactive P in water flux rates between sediment and overlying water (FDP) was changed from - 5.37 to 5.14 mg.m(-2).day(-1). The FP and FDP were negatively correlated with the content of total P in water (WTP), dissolved reactive P in water (WDRP), pH of sediment (pH), and microbial biomass P (MBP), but increased with temperature (T), aluminum phosphate (Al.P), and occluded phosphate (Oc.P). The P flux rates were affected by temperature variation both directly and indirectly; the mechanism of how temperature influenced the fate of P in the wetland is still not clear. Therefore, the physicochemical properties and kinetic, thermodynamic, and microbiology characteristics should be combined together to clarify the mechanism in future research.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2023	30	5					12441	12452		10.1007/s11356-022-23015-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-23015-7		SEP 2022						36112283					WOS:000854414400006

To date, few studies have evaluated the anthropogenic impact on the spatial and temporal changes of DOM composition in large river systems. Here, FT-ICR-MS combined with excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) and biomarkers were applied to resolve chemical differences of DOM collected from the Changjiang basin at different hydrological and environmental conditions. PCA and cluster analysis illustrated that samples collected from lake systems and northern and southern tributaries differed from the two batches of main stream samples, particularly due to higher contribution of nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds. Correlation of land-use information along the tributaries with different PCA loadings indicated that agricultural, forest and wetland areas and wastewater discharge control the composition of DOM within these subregions. Higher heteroatom content (especially CHONx) in the low discharge period (2009) may be contributed by paddy soil leaching into groundwater. The relative peak magnitude of sulfur containing formulas was elevated during flood season (2010), which may be related to pollutions in areas of high population density. In addition, lignin phenol concentrations were higher in the flood season because of elevated soil erosion. Consequently, land use and human activities can strongly alter the quality and composition of DOM in watersheds flowing through densely populated regions, which may also impact or influence the riverine carbon flux in anthropogenically disturbed river systems.

Species composition determines resistance to drought in dry forests of the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence forest region of central Ontario	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: Predicted changes in the frequency of short raise concerns about potential effects of climate change Few experiments have investigated die effects of tree spec;rat drought events forest ecosystems. s.richness and composition in :forest assemblages exposed to drought, and general conclusions for these systems arc currently lacking. We tested the hypothesis that different species richness and composition affects community-level stability during a severe short-term drought event across a gradient of tree species assemblages typical of temperate forest ecosystems on dry substrates. Location: Great Lakes St. Lawrence forest region, central Ontario, Canad.a. Methods: The study assemblages spanned a gradient of 15 different combinations of species richness and composition of lour tree species. The drought occurred in 2005 and was characterized by high growing season temperature and low precipitation. Plots (n = 63) representing replicate assernblages were selected to collect increment cores (n = 1193) and examine growth responses to past drought at Elie community and population levels. Cross-dated tree ring measurements were used to reconstruct basal area increment (BM) and calculate indices of resistance, resilience and productivity over the drought period. We used hierarchical analysis of variance models to estimate the effects of species richness and composition on drought responses. Results: We identified a significant effect of species composition on con:tin-unity-level resistance and productivity. White pine (Pious strobus) abundance was associated with lower community resistance and white birch (Betula papyrifera) abundance with higher resistance. Assemblages with greater productivity were often characterized by the high abundance of trembling aspen (Populus tionutoides). There was no overall effect of the assemblage gradient on the population-level stability; however, red pine (Pious resinosa) productivity was higher in combination with trembling aspen and white birch. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that species richness had no effect on the community-level stability of growth during a drought in temperate forests on dry substrates. Instead, there were important compositional effects that deter 'nine some aspects of stability during drought events. If pine forests were 'nap aged to maintain a component of deciduous species, the capacity community-level effects of more :frequent droughtwould increase.

J	Hodges, D; Pu, ZX				Hodges, Derek; Pu, Zhaoxia			The Climatology, Frequency, and Distribution of Cold Season Fog Events in Northern Utah	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												The distribution and frequency of fog events during the cold season in northern Utah is studied using surface Mesowest data from 2004 to 2014. Fog is identified using the reported weather conditions, relative humidity, and visibility. The length and time of each fog occurrence is calculated. Statistics are performed on daily, monthly, and seasonal timescales. To ensure representativeness of the data and to account for the relatively small sample size, "near-fog" conditions are included in some statistics. Results show that there is significant variability among the valleys in northern Utah in terms of both quantity and timing of fog events. Fog occurs more frequently in locations close to lakes such as the Great Salt Lake or Utah Lake than in locations farther away. It is also noted that small, enclosed valleys have higher amounts of fog than broader, open valleys. Throughout the region, there is a distinct peak in fog in late January for most stations. A strong peak in fog occurrences near dawn is also found for all cold season months. In addition, the influence of local, mesoscale conditions on the fog distribution is evident in many stations. It is found that the existence of fog at one location is a very poor predictor of fog at nearby locations on a daily timescale, which implies serious forecasting difficulties over complex terrain. However, it is also found that on an annual timescale the amount of fog at one location can be used to estimate the amount of fog at another location. The controlling factors that contribute to the variability of fog events over northern Utah (a mountainous region) are discussed.

Our high-resolution facies analysis of the interval between the Lower Pumice and the White Tuff demonstrated that debris-flow deposits and paleosols are dominant in the studied sequence. Fluvial channel-fill and small pond facies are the subordinate components in this interval. Most of the channel-fill deposits are interpreted as having been accumulated from ephemeral streams. The wide distribution of the Middle Pumice, the fact that it contains grains with older ages than those of the Lower Pumice, and the presence of "traction carpet" deposits allow the interpretation of the pumice interval as having been deposited from a hyperconcentrated flow probably caused by crater-lake destruction around the peak of Mt. Sahand, which supplied older rocks to the flow. The internal architecture of fluvial channel-fill deposits and the structures of paleosols (rhizoliths, cracks and slickensides: probable Vertic Inceptisols) imply a seasonal climate during deposition of the studied interval. This is consistent with previous environmental reconstructions based on mammal fossils (woodland-dominated savannah) as well as the results of phytolith analysis and delta O-18 data obtained from northern Iran. However, flood deposits covering the paleosols, showing sheet-like geometry, may not have been affected by large trees on the flood plain: the extent of woodland around the study site appears to have been limited.					; Sakai, Tetsuya/W-6575-2019; Ataabadi, Majid/S-7971-2019	Fortelius, Mikael/0000-0002-4851-783X; 													1867-1594	1867-1608				SEP	2016	96	3					383	398		10.1007/s12549-016-0238-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12549-016-0238-z													WOS:000383148900004
J	Foster, SE; Sprules, WG				Foster, Sophie E.; Sprules, W. Gary			Effects of the Bythotrephes invasion on native predatory invertebrates	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We explore the effects of the invasive predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus on the abundances and seasonal zooplankton consumption by the native predatory invertebrates Leptodora kindtii, Chaoborus spp., and Mysis relicta in inland lakes of Ontario. In lakes with Bythotrephes, the seasonal consumption by all invertebrate predators combined ranged from 2.39 to 13.50 g m(-2) and was 300% higher than in lakes without the invader. This was due to Bythotrephes because there was no invasion effect on Chaoborus or Mysis consumption, while it actually decreased Leptodora consumption. Leptodora and Chaoborus abundances were lower in invaded lakes, but only Leptodora abundance was negatively correlated with Bythotrephes abundance. There was no effect of Bythotrephes on Mysis abundance. Bythotrephes consume more zooplankton than most other predatory invertebrates, including copepods, and often consume more zooplankton than planktivorous fish. The large increase in predatory invertebrate abundance and consumption due to Bythotrephes means that substantial portions of zooplankton production are probably being diverted from other consumers, such as juvenile and planktivorous fish, and that the role of predatory invertebrates in the pelagia of inland lakes has been intensified by the arrival of Bythotrephes.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2009	54	3					757	769		10.4319/lo.2009.54.3.0757	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.54.3.0757													WOS:000268325000009

Modeling the impacts of calcite precipitation on the epilimnion of an ultraoligotrophic, hard-water lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A mass-balance model of calcite precipitation was developed to investigate the interactions of the varied processes governing the generation and fate of calcite in lakes. The model was used in conjunction with data to assess the evolution and impact of calcite precipitation for calcareous, ultraoligotrophic Torch Lake, Michigan (USA). This lake is an ideal setting for implementation of a baseline modeling study of calcite precipitation where the physical drivers could be evaluated without being dominated, as in many systems, by biological processes. The model provides a representation of calcite precipitation with particulate surface area changing over time, and demonstrates that it is possible for the change in water clarity to be explained by calcite precipitation employing standard optical models. Using the mass balance model to quantify the roles of the various chemical, biological and physical processes interacting in the lake's epilimnion, it was shown that the seasonal temperature rise and air-water CO2 exchange drive calcite precipitation much more than primary production for this ultraoligotrophic system.

The intent of the review is to understand the state of water security issues in the agricultural sector in relation to climate variability and climate change, existing agricultural water management practices and identification of gaps in knowledge and practices that need to be addressed in the future. It is found that the basin has huge potential of water resources but it is constrained by high spatiotemporal climate variability which has resulted in very variable water supply for agriculture. The challenge is aggravated by lack of effective and locally relevant agricultural water management practices. The central part of the basin in particular is characterized by very short rainy season and long dry season and thus it is the main hotspot of water security risks to agriculture. Climate change, growing demand for water due to increasing population, and land degradation will exacerbate water security risks on agriculture. Research and development efforts to addressing the challenges have generally been limited in scope and spatial scale, so much remains to be done. This review identifies major gaps that need to be investigated and understood in the future to address water security issues on agriculture in the basin.					; Bewket, Woldeamlak/MTG-0133-2025	Bewket, Woldeamlak/0000-0003-4445-1607; 														2624-9375				SEP 14	2022	4								961948	10.3389/frwa.2022.961948	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2022.961948													WOS:000861881200001

For lacustrine dolomite, current research has not yet provided a reliable explanation for its complex genesis mechanism. The Early Cretaceous lakes in Northwest China host various morphological dolomites, providing valuable materials for exploring the origin of dolomites. According to their petrological and mineralogical characteristics, it can be divided into thick laminated dolomite, thin laminated dolomite, dolomitic mudstone, and vein dolomite. The ratios of trace elements and rare earth elements show that these dolomites precipitated in a brackish-suboxic environment. The high delta C-13 values (>8 parts per thousand VPDB) of thick laminated dolomite and some thin laminated dolomite suggest the involvement of methane-producing microorganisms in the precipitation of dolomite, and the appearance of microscale/nanoscale spherical dolomite aggregates and the dispersed organic matter around dolomite particles jointly confirm that microbial-mediated biological activity promotes dolomite precipitation. The dolomite stoichiometry (mole % MgCO3) confirms that thick laminated dolomite was deposited in a restricted shallow water environment, while dolomitic mudstone is mainly deposited in relatively open water areas. The thin laminated dolomite in the shale laminae represents short-term or seasonal climatic and environmental fluctuations. In addition, some carbonate minerals of dolomitic mudstone in shallow water environment recrystallized by post-depositional hydrothermal effect, resulting in delta O-18 value decreased (<-10 parts per thousand VPDB). The vein dolomite is characterized by high rare earth content and low delta C-13 and delta O-18 values, and its Sr isotope (0.712894 +/- 0.000374) values reflect that the hydrothermal fluid may have been formed by the mixing of infiltrating lake water and crustal magmatic water. According to the characteristics of fluid inclusions, it is inferred that the hydrothermal fluid has the characteristics of low temperature (108.3 degrees C-159.8 degrees C), medium salinity (3.5 wt%-14.3 wt% NaCl) and high density (0.95-1.00 g/cm(3)). The microbial mediation and tectonic hydrothermal fluids play an important role in the formation of the Early Cretaceous lacustrine dolomite.

Effects of long-term climate trends on the methane and CO2 exchange processes of Toolik Lake, Alaska	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Methane and carbon dioxide effluxes from aquatic systems in the Arctic will affect and likely amplify global change. As permafrost thaws in a warming world, more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and greenhouse gases are produced and move from soils to surface waters where the DOC can be oxidized to CO2 and also released to the atmosphere. Our main study objective is to measure the release of carbon to the atmosphere via effluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from Toolik Lake, a deep, dimictic, low-arctic lake in northern Alaska. By combining direct eddy covariance flux measurements with continuous gas pressure measurements in the lake surface waters, we quantified the k (600) piston velocity that controls gas flux across the air-water interface. Our measured k values for CH4 and CO2 were substantially above predictions from several models at low to moderate wind speeds, and only converged on model predictions at the highest wind speeds. We attribute this higher flux at low wind speeds to effects on water-side turbulence resulting from how the surrounding tundra vegetation and topography increase atmospheric turbulence considerably in this lake, above the level observed over large ocean surfaces. We combine this process-level understanding of gas exchange with the trends of a climate-relevant long-term (30 + years) meteorological data set at Toolik Lake to examine short-term variations (2015 ice-free season) and interannual variability (2010-2015 ice-free seasons) of CH4 and CO2 fluxes. We argue that the biological processing of DOC substrate that becomes available for decomposition as the tundra soil warms is important for understanding future trends in aquatic gas fluxes, whereas the variability and long-term trends of the physical and meteorological variables primarily affect the timing of when higher or lower than average fluxes are observed. We see no evidence suggesting that a tipping point will be reached soon to change the status of the aquatic system from gas source to sink. We estimate that changes in CH4 and CO2 fluxes will be constrained with a range of +30% and -10% of their current values over the next 30 years.

USE OF BREEDING AND NONBREEDING ENCOUNTERS TO ESTIMATE SURVIVAL AND BREEDING-SITE FIDELITY OF THE PIPING PLOVER AT THE GREAT LAKES	CONDOR												In the Great Lakes region, numbers of the Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) are gradually increasing, but the population of <100 pairs is still at risk of extinction and remains sensitive to fluctuations in adult survival. Given the central role of adult survival in population recovery, an accurate estimate of this quantity is essential. Using a Barker model and 11 years of mark-resighting data of breeding and nonbreeding Piping Plovers (1998-2008), we estimated true adult survival (S), probability of detection of breeding birds (p), probability of detection nonbreeding birds (R), and site fidelity (F). Adults' survival rate averaged 0.76 but with considerable annual process variation (sigma = 0.05) and strong evidence of decline over this period. The probability of detection of breeding birds was near perfect (p = 1.00, 95% Cl 0.97-1.00), but probabilities of detection of nonbreeders were substantially lower, although they increased from approximately 0.25 to 0.50 through the study period because of increased effort in observation and reporting. The birds' fidelity to the area of the Great Lakes in which they were monitored was high (<(x)over bar> = 0.91, 95% Cl 0.66-0.98), with evidence of an increase through time that we attribute to increased intensity of monitoring. Evidence for a decline in true adult survival over nearly a decade suggests a pressing need for research on the timing and causes of adult mortality in this population.					; Arnold, Todd/H-6945-2019	Arnold, Todd/0000-0002-7920-772X; 													0010-5422					NOV	2010	112	4					637	643		10.1525/cond.2010.100017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cond.2010.100017													WOS:000285727700001

This study uses optical and radar remote sensing, alongside spatial analysis, to examine thermokarst features and their driving factors in the source region of the Yangtze River (SRYR) on the central Tibetan Plateau. We analyse the distribution, interaction, and key environmental factors influencing thermokarst ponds and ground surface deformation, which are the two widespread and noticeable thermokarst features. Since the 1960s, the number of small water bodies has doubled from approximately similar to 2 x 10(4) to similar to 4 x 10(4) by the 2020s, with the median size of these water bodies decreasing from 2.3 x 10(4) m(2) to 1.4 x 10(4) m(2). The permafrost terrain has an average subsidence rate of 6.8 mm/a. About 50.9% of the SRYR exhibits evident thermokarst features. Surficial geological factors, especially geomorphology and slope, are primary factors in shaping the spatial distributions of thermokarst features. Both seasonal deformation and long-term subsidence rates are more pronounced in areas with thermokarst ponds. However, once pond coverage exceeds around 5%, the amplifying effect on long-term subsidence rates and seasonal deformation diminishes. The investigation further reveals that the relationship between seasonal deformation and long-term subsidence is not strictly linear and that the combined increase in seasonal deformation and long-term subsidence applies only to areas with seasonal deformation below approximately 20 mm. Beyond this threshold, the long-term subsidence rate is no longer exacerbated by increased seasonal deformation.					; Xiao, Yao/OGN-4811-2025; Hu, Guojie/M-5738-2019; Wang, Lingxiao/KOC-2800-2024; Tang, Yunqi/HLQ-4582-2023; zhao, lin/M-9536-2018; Zhao, Lin/M-9536-2018	Wang, Lingxiao/0000-0003-2081-1022; zhao, lin/0000-0003-0245-8413; 													0197-9337	1096-9837				OCT	2024	49	13					4324	4339		10.1002/esp.5969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5969		SEP 2024											WOS:001304054900001

Gansu Province, located in northwest China, contains all wetland types except coastal wetlands. The complexity of its wetland types has resulted in a lack of accurate and comprehensive information on wetland changes. Using Gansu Province as a case study, we employed the GEE platform and Landsat time-series satellite data, combining high-quality sample datasets with feature-optimized multi-source feature sets. The random forest algorithm was utilized to create wetland classification maps for Gansu Province across eight periods from 1987 to 2020 at a 30 m resolution and to quantify changes in wetland area and type. The results showed that the wetland mapping method achieved robust classification results, with an average overall accuracy (OA) of 96.0% and a kappa coefficient of 0.954 across all years. The marsh type exhibited the highest average user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA), at 96.4% and 95.2%, respectively. Multi-source feature aggregation and feature optimization effectively improve classification accuracy. Topographic and seasonal features were identified as the most important for wetland extraction, while textural features were the least important. By 2020, the total wetland area in Gansu Province was 10,575.49 km2, a decrease of 4536.86 km2 compared to 1987. The area of marshes decreased the most, primarily converting into grasslands and forests. River, lake, and constructed wetland types generally exhibited an increasing trend with fluctuations. This study provides technical support for wetland ecological protection in Gansu Province and offers a reference for wetland mapping, monitoring, and sustainable development in arid and semi-arid regions.

The surface water in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) has a high sediment content and spatially heterogeneous sediment distribution, presenting a significant challenge for surface water extraction. In this study, we first analyze the applicability of nine water indexes in the YRB by using the Landsat series images (Landsat 5, 7, 8) and then examine the correlation between the accuracy of the water indexes and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations. On this basis, we propose a surface water extraction method considering the SPM concentrations (SWE-CSPM). Finally, we examine the dynamic variations in the surface water in the YRB at four scales: the global scale, the secondary water resource zoning scale, the provincial scale, and the typical water scale. The results indicate that (1) among the nine water indexes, the MBWI has the highest water extraction accuracy, followed by the AWEInsh and WI2021, while the NDWI has the lowest. (2) Compared with the nine water indexes and the multi-index water extraction rule method (MIWER), the SWE-CSPM can effectively reduce the commission errors of surface water extraction, and the water extraction accuracy is the highest (overall accuracy 95.44%, kappa coefficient 90.62%). (3) At the global scale, the maximum water area of the YRB shows a decreasing trend, but the change amount is small. The permanent water area shows an uptrend, whereas the seasonal water area shows a downtrend year by year. The reason may be that the increase in surface runoff and the construction of reservoir projects have led to the transformation of some seasonal water into permanent water. (4) At the secondary water resource zoning scale, the permanent water area of other secondary water resource zonings shows an increasing trend in different degrees, except for the Interior Drainage Area. (5) At the provincial scale, the permanent water area of all provinces shows an uptrend, while the seasonal water areas show a fluctuating downtrend. The maximum water area of Shandong, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Qinghai increases slowly, while the other provinces show a decreasing trend. (6) At the typical water scale, there are significant differences in the water area variation process in Zhaling Lake, Eling Lake, Wuliangsuhai, Hongjiannao, and Dongping Lake, but the permanent water area and maximum water area of these waters have increased over the past decade. This study offers significant technical support for the dynamic monitoring of surface water and helps to deeply understand the spatiotemporal variations in surface water in the YRB.

Exploring riverine zooplankton in three habitats of the Illinois River ecosystem: Where do they come from?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We sampled three habitats (main channel, side channels, and backwater lakes) during 2 yr along 32 km of the Illinois River to compare zooplankton distribution and dynamics, as well as evaluate the possible effects of hydrology on taxonomic abundance and distribution. Zooplankton assemblages displayed both spatial and temporal variation. Whereas the riverine zooplankton assemblage was dominated by rotifers, the backwater lake assemblage was dominated by copepods. Zooplankton densities in the main channel peaked earlier in the season in both years than the backwater lake habitats. To determine if these patterns were caused by fluvial exchanges occurring between habitats during flooding, we sampled the connections between the backwater lake and main channel habitats and found that large numbers of zooplankton entered the main channel via these connections. Further, calculations of main channel population growth, birth, and death rates showed that population growth rates most commonly exceeded birth rates during the flooding period. Seasonal inoculums from off-channel habitats could play an important role in riverine zooplankton dynamics. However, for the main channel to achieve the measured zooplankton densities, similar to 400,000 backwater lakes would be required and zooplankton would need to travel an unrealistic number of days and distance based on estimated growth rates. Thus, other mechanisms (hatching of resting eggs or in situ reproduction) are likely responsible for zooplankton abundances.

Intercomparison of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) stand transpiration responses to environmental conditions from the Western Great Lakes Region of the United States	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												We investigated the assumption, necessary for comparison between bottom-up scaling of plot level fluxes to top-down scaling of regional models, that small plots of sap flux are representative of the transpiration component of regional land-surface atmosphere water vapor interactions. We conducted sap flux measurements in three stands dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) representing old-growth (Sylvania, SV), second-growth (Willow Creek, WC), and thinned second-growth stands (Hay Creek, HC). Using the sap flux-scaled estimates of transpiration we tested whether (1) differences in A. saccharum transpiration between the three stands could be explained by leaf area index and/or stand inventory measures, and (2) the Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator (TREES) model could capture differences in the response of transpiration to environmental variables. We found large differences between the three stands over two growing seasons in A. saccharum canopy transpiration per unit ground area (1.61, 3.66, and 0.85 mm day(-1) for SV, WC, and HC respectively) and canopy transpiration per unit leaf area (0.31, 1.00, and 0.21 mm day(-1) for SV, WC, and HC respectively). While none of these differences could be explained with stand or environmental variables, the TREES model was able to effectively capture the half-hourly temporal variability in the sap flux data. TREES incorporates an adaptive parameterization scheme which improves upon traditional sensitivity tests of models. By incorporating both simple plant hydraulic theory and adaptive parameterization we were able to minimize the necessary parameters to those that are sensible and easily applied regionally. our results indicate that while the assumption of uniform water loss from A. saccharum forests regionally is incorrect, models that incorporate simple plant hydraulics effectively capture the dynamics of transpiration across disparate stands.

Analyzing of basal area increment (BAI) patterns using linear mixed effect models reveals a complex interplay between atmospheric nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) deposition, climatic variables and changing CO2 2 concentrations. Beech BAI responds positively to N deposition (in tandem with air CO2 2 concentration), with soil phosphorus (P) availability emerging as a significant factor influencing overall growth rates. Fir BAI, on the other hand, was particularly negatively influenced by S deposition, although recent growth acceleration suggests growth resilience in post-pollution period. This fir growth surge likely coincides with stimulation of P acquisition following the decline of acidic pollution. The consequence is the current highest productivity among the studied tree species. The growth dynamics of both conifers were closely linked to the stoichiometric imbalance of phosphorus in needles, indicating the possible sensitivity of exogenous controls on nutrient uptake. Furthermore, spruce BAI was positively linked to calcium availability across sites. Despite enhanced water-use efficiency under elevated CO2, 2 , spruce growth is constrained by precipitation deficit and demonstrates weakening resilience to increasing growing season air temperatures. Overall, these findings underscore the intricate relationships between atmospheric pollution, nutrient availability, and climatic factors in shaping the growth dynamics of European forest ecosystems. Thus, incorporating biogeochemical context of nutrient availability is essential for realistic modelling of tree growth in a changing climate.

Tracking Extensive Portfolio of Cyanotoxins in Five-Year Lake Survey and Identifying Indicator Metabolites of Cyanobacterial Taxa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial blooms require monitoring, as they pose a threat to ecosystems and human health, especially by the release of toxins. Along with widely reported microcystins, cyanobacteria coproduce other bioactive metabolites; however, information about their dynamics in surface waters is sparse. We investigated dynamics across full bloom successions throughout a five-year lake monitoring campaign (Greifensee, Switzerland) spanning 150 sampling dates. We conducted extensive suspect screening of cyanobacterial metabolites using the database CyanoMetDB. Across all 850 samples, 35 metabolites regularly co-occurred. Microcystins were present in 70% of samples, with [d-Asp(3),(E)-Dhb(7)]MC-RR reaching concentrations of 70 ng/L. Anabaenopeptins, meanwhile, were detected in 95% of all samples with concentrations of Oscillamide Y up to 100-fold higher than microcystins. Based on LC-MS response and frequency, we identified indicator metabolites exclusively produced by one of three cyanobacteria isolated from the lake, these being [d-Asp(3),(E)-Dhb(7)]MC-RR from Planktothrix sp. G2020, Microginin 761B from Microcystis sp. G2011, and Ferintoic acid B from Microcystis sp. G2020. These indicators showed distinct temporal trends and peaking seasons that reflect the variance in either the abundance of the producing cyanobacteria or their toxin production dynamics. Our approach demonstrates that selecting high LC-MS response and frequent and species-specific indicator metabolites can be advantageous for cyanobacterial monitoring.

Size-structured habitat selection by arapaima in floodplain lakes of the Lower Amazon	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Human modification of floodplain ecosystems is widespread and a major threat to fish populations, particularly in the tropics where fish diversity and rates of floodplain degradation are high. Identifying measures to minimize the susceptibility of floodplain fishes to habitat modification requires understanding dry-season lake habitat selection for species of conservation concern. This study examined the effects of environmental factors on dry-season floodplain lake habitat selection by arapaima (Arapaima spp.) and determined the extent to which they differed across three size classes. In floodplain lakes of the lower Amazon River, variables were measured at locations representing habitat availability and compared with measurements taken where arapaima were observed during surface breathing. Regression models were used to account for between-lake variation in the presence of arapaima owing to nearby fishing communities. The probability of arapaima presence at each sample location was modelled based on the variables measured. The results indicated that arapaima expressed distinct habitat selection patterns, which differed significantly across size classes. The general pattern observed was that all arapaima were more likely to be found in deeper, more turbid, and higher conductivity locations, whereas smaller arapaima were more likely to remain near dense beds of floating macrophytes. The probability of arapaima presence differed among fishing community territories, reflecting differences in management schemes. Deeper, macrophyte-rich sections of floodplain lakes appear to provide key habitats for arapaima and deserve consideration for becoming priority targets for conservation of the rich diversity of fish species in these systems.

Although soil microbial communities play key roles in nitrogen pollutant interception and in maintaining ecosystem stability, few studies have investigated these communities in lake vegetation buffer zone soils. In this study, the effects of seasonal and human disturbances on soil microbial communities of the vegetation buffer zones of Hongfeng Lake were determined by high-throughput sequencing and community profiling. BIOENV analysis revealed that soil redox potential was the primary factor associated with soil microbial community composition during the wet season, while Total nitrogen better explained variation in the dry season microbial communities. The relative abundances of Cyanobacteria were significantly higher in vegetation buffer zone soils that were polluted by upstream livestock and domestic sewage. Further, analysis of microbial community network topological features indicated that the soil microbial communities of the vegetation buffer zone markedly differed between wet and dry seasons. Specifically, wet season community networks suggested that the proliferation of Cyanobacteria, E. coli, and Panaeolus papilionaceus inhibited the growth of microorganisms capable of nitrification and denitrification, thereby contributing to increased risk of nitrogen loss to surface waters. Based on these results, we suggest that discharge of domestic sewage and livestock wastewater should be prohibited along Hongfeng Lake tributaries. Moreover, vegetation should be artificially managed to improve the mitigation of non-point source pollution into the lake via vegetation buffer zones.

Dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways in an oligotrophic freshwater ecosystem: spatial and temporal trends	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Elevated nitrate (NO3-) concentrations can cause eutrophication, which may lead to harmful algal blooms, loss of habitat and reduction in biodiversity. Denitrification, a dissimilatory process that removes NO3- mainly as dinitrogen gas (N-2), is believed to be the dominant NO3- removal pathway in aquatic ecosystems. Evidence suggests that a less well-studied process, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which retains nitrogen (N) in the system, may also be important under favorable conditions. Using stable isotope tracers in sealed microcosms, we measured the potential for NO3- losses due to DNRA and denitrification in an oligotrophic freshwater ecosystem. We took sediment and water samples at runoff and baseflow, across several ecotypes. Our objective was to quantify the relative importance of DNRA compared to denitrification with changes in ecotype and season. Potential denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 0.14 +/- 0.03 mu gN gAFDM(-1) d(-1). Potential DNRA rates ranged from 0 to 0.0051 +/- 0.0008 mu gN gAFDM(-1) d(-1). Denitrification losses peaked at the inflow stream ecotype at 96.2% of total dissimilatory NO3- removal, whereas losses due to DNRA peaked in the lake ecotype at 34.4%. When averaged over the entire system, denitrification peaked at baseflow (31.2%), while DNRA peaked at runoff (2.9%). Although NO3- transformations due to denitrification were higher than DNRA in all ecotype and temporal comparisons, our results suggest that DNRA is also important under favorable conditions.

J	Ye, XC; Zhang, Q; Viney, NR				Ye, Xuchun; Zhang, Qi; Viney, N. R.			The effect of soil data resolution on hydrological processes modelling in a large humid watershed	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Hydrological process modelling depends on the data characterizing the heterogeneity of the catchment. In particular, in a large-scale catchment, could a higher resolution of input data contribute to a more accurate result? In this study, surveyed soil data with two different spatial resolutions were used as input data for a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model simulation in a large humid watershed of Xinjiang River (15 535 km(2)) in Poyang Lake catchment in China. Simulations of stream flow, soil water storage and evapotranspiration (ET) generated using the two soil datasets were compared, and the impact of soil data resolution was analysed. The results indicate that the different resolutions of soil data have a great impact on the distribution of hydrological response units in the SWAT model, but do not lead to obvious differences in stream flow simulation. The finer resolution data produced a higher monthly soil water storage simulation than the lower-resolution data across the watershed, while the seasonal variation of soil water content (SW) shows a close relation to the local precipitation and temperature. Results also show that the soil ET calculation method in the SWAT model is not particularly sensitive to the different resolutions of the soil maps. The implications of this study are that improvement of the resolution of soil data does not necessarily contribute to a more accurate prediction of stream flow in large-scale watersheds. In practical studies, modellers need to select an appropriate resolution of soil data depending on the scale of watershed and the level of accuracy required, and also need to consider the principle of the model and the physical meaning of some key parameters to explain the simulation results.

CH4 oxidation rates were measured using a tritiated CH4 radiotracer technique. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequence analysis were used to characterize methanotroph community composition. A temporally shifting zone of elevated CH4 oxidation (59-123 nM day(-1)) was consistently associated with a suboxycline, microaerophilic zone that migrated upwards in the water column as stratification progressed. FISH analysis revealed stable numbers of type I (4.1-9.3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) and type II (1.4-3.4 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) methanotrophs over depth and over time. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis indicated slight shifts in methanotroph community composition despite stable absolute cell numbers. Variable CH4 oxidation rates in the presence of a relatively stable methanotroph population suggested that zones of high CH4 oxidation resulted from an increase in activity of a subset of the existing methanotroph population. These results challenge existing paradigms suggesting that zones of elevated CH4 oxidation activity result from the accumulation of methanotrophic biomass and illustrate that type II methanotrophs may be an important component of the methanotroph population in saline and/or alkaline pelagic environments.

Strong spatial differentiation of N and P deficiency, primary productivity and community composition between Nyanza Gulf and Lake Victoria (Kenya, East Africa) and the implications for nutrient management	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Study of phytoplankton nutrient status, biomass, productivity and species composition was carried out between March 2005 and March 2006, along a transect between north-eastern open Lake Victoria and the large, shallow Nyanza Gulf in order to examine how the terrestrial run-off can influence phytoplankton community and nutrient status and determine whether nutrient management of catchment run-off has the potential to control the algal blooms in the gulf. Hydrological and nutrient differences between the open lake and the gulf create a transition from P deficiency for phytoplankton within the gulf to nitrogen deficiency in open lake. The shallow and turbid gulf was continuously dominated by non-nitrogen-fixing filamentous and chroococcale colonial cyanobacteria, but seasonal stratification and deeper mixing depth in the open lake favoured diazotrophic cyanobacteria and diatoms. Seston ratios and metabolic nutrient assays indicated the gulf to be sufficiently phosphorus deficient to impose P limitation on phytoplankton growth and biomass. In contrast, the open lake is not P deficient and is more likely to experience N deficiency that favours diazotrophic cyanobacteria. Because of high turbidity in the gulf, the euphotic zone is very shallow, limiting integral primary productivity compared to the less turbid open lake; high PAR extinction may also favour Microcystis blooms in the gulf. Increased P loading into the gulf may translate to higher algal biomass, mainly of the bloom-forming and potentially toxic cyanobacteria, and therefore, reduction in P loading into the gulf should be a management priority. However, a review of historical data indicates that the greatest change in water quality in the gulf is increased turbidity that reduces light availability and may limit algal growth more than P deficiency in years of high rainfall and river discharge.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2013	58	11					2237	2252		10.1111/fwb.12205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12205													WOS:000325156400003

The most commonly employed organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) and herbicide atrazine were analyzed. The water samples were collected seasonally from Meiliangwan Bay within a period of one year. The pesticides were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) with mu ECD or NPD after solid-phase extraction (SPE), which was confirmed by GC with an ion trap mass spectrometry (MS). The mean concentrations were 1.98 ng/l for lindane, 0.378 ng/l for heptachlor epoxide, 0.367 ng/l for p,p'-DDE, 0.496 ng/l for p,p'-DDD, 1.06 ng/l for p,p'-DDT and 51.6 ng/l for dichlorvos, 39.0 ng/l for demeton, 346 ng/l for dimethoate, 4.12 ng/l for methyl parathion, 11.6 ng/l for malathion, 2.17 ng/l for parathion and 217 ng/l for atrazine. Generally, low concentrations of OCP were found, whereas the concentrations of the OPPs and atrazine in the water of Taihu Lake were relatively high. Heptachlor epoxide and lindane were the two most commonly encountered OCPs while dichlorvos, demeton and dimethoate were found to have much higher concentrations and occurrences than other OPPs.																			0167-6369					DEC	2006	123	1-3					351	370		10.1007/s10661-006-9202-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-006-9202-0								16770496					WOS:000242360900023

A test of the courtship stimulation and courtship rejection hypotheses	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Female ornamentation was initially thought to reflect genetic correlation with the more elaborate male trait. However, this cannot explain female-specific ornamentation, such as the conspicuous coloration displayed by females of many species during breeding. Females may exhibit distinctive, reproductive coloration to 1) advertise receptivity and stimulate male courtship or 2) advertise nonreceptivity when gravid to reduce male courtship, harassment, and potentially costly copulations. We tested both hypotheses in the Lake Eyre dragon lizard (Ctenophorus maculosus) by quantifying female coloration, using spectroradiometry and a model of lizard color perception, and male and female behavior across the female reproductive cycle. Females develop bright orange coloration on their throat and abdomen during the breeding season, whereas males remain cryptically colored. The onset of orange coloration was associated with enlarging follicles, acceptance of copulations, and escalation of male courtship. Rather than fading once females were no longer receptive, however, the intense orange coloration remained until oviposition. Furthermore, despite maximal coloration associated with nonreceptivity, males persisted with courtship and copulation attempts, and females increased rejection behaviors comprising lateral displays and flipping onto their backs (to prevent forced intromission), both of which emphasize the conspicuous ventrolateral coloration. These apparently costly rejection behaviors did not reduce male harassment but did decrease the frequency of potentially costly copulations. These results suggest that 1) males do not determine female receptivity based on coloration alone and 2) the potentially costly rejection behaviors may have evolved to reduce the direct costs of mating.					; Jessop, Tim/Q-2473-2019	Stuart-Fox, Devi/0000-0003-3362-1412; Jessop, Tim S./0000-0002-7712-4373; 													1045-2249	1465-7279				NOV-DEC	2009	20	6					1334	1342		10.1093/beheco/arp136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arp136													WOS:000271813600025

Satellite remote sensing is characterized by large-scale monitoring, timely updates, and simplicity, and it has become an important means of obtaining the distribution of surface water bodies. This study is based on a long time-series Landsat satellite images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, focusing on Anhui Province in China, and proposes a method for extracting surface water that combines water indices, Bias-Corrected Fuzzy Clustering Method (BCFCM), and OTSU threshold segmentation. The spatial distribution of surface water in Anhui Province was obtained from 1984 to 2021, and further analysis was conducted on the spatiotemporal characteristics of surface water in each city and three major river basins within the province. The results indicated that the overall accuracy of water extraction in this study was 94.06 %. Surface water in Anhui was most abundant in 1998 and least in 2001, with more distribution in the south than in the north. Northern Anhui is dominated by rivers, while southern Anhui has more lakes. Permanent surface water with an inundation frequency of above 75% covered approximately 4341 km2, accounting for 32.03 % of the total water, while seasonal water with an inundation frequency between 5 % and 75 % covered about 6661 km2, accounting for 49.15 % of the total water, others were considered temporary surface water. By comparing our results with the global annual surface water released by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), we found that our study performed better in extracting lakes and rivers in terms of completeness, but the extraction results for aquaculture areas were slightly less than the JRC dataset. Overall, the long-term surface water dataset established in this study can effectively supplement the existing datasets and provide important references for regional water resource investigation, management, as well as flood monitoring.																				2405-8440				SEP 15	2024	10	17							e36660	10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e36660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e36660		AUG 2024						39263062					WOS:001301755700001

Response of natural tree regeneration to climate adaptation treatments in Pinus resinosa-dominated forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Uncertainty and emerging threats associated with climate change necessitate the development of new ap-proaches for managing forest ecosystems. To address this need the Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) Network was established to examine the efficacy of three climate adaptation strategies in important forest types across North America: 1) resistance to change by increasing overstory tree health through reduced inter-tree competition, 2) resilience by creating conditions that allow change within the natural range of vari-ability while encouraging greater abundance of native species considered suitable for projected future climate, and 3) transition which involves actively facilitating systems to have a more adaptive response. The present study focused on the influence of Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change treatments on natural regeneration in a Pinus resinosa Ait. (red pine)-dominated forest in northern Minnesota, USA. We aimed to answer the following research questions: 1) How do different climate adaptation strategies (resistance, resilience, and transition) in-fluence natural regeneration relative to passive management? 2) Do impacts on the understory woody com-munity, including trees and shrubs, differ among treatments in terms of abundance, composition, and diversity? Naturally regenerated trees and shrubs were sampled during the 5th growing season following Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change treatment implementation (May-August 2019). The species composition of naturally regenerated trees differed among treatments as did adaptability, quantified as a composite index that integrated disturbance response and life history traits. The transition treatment resulted in greater capacity for adaptation to future conditions in the newly regenerated cohort. All treatments increased tree species diversity and richness relative to passive management, but the greatest woody species diversity occurred in the resilience treatment. This suggests a trade-off between maximizing woody species diversity (greatest in the resilience treatment) and adaptability (greatest in transition treatment). Overall, these results affirm the potential for using silviculture to increase tree diversity and adaptability through natural regeneration in anticipation of threats posed by changing climate in a major forest type, with results serving as a model for expectations in similar ecosystems.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				NOV 1	2022	523								120499	10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120499		SEP 2022											WOS:000863054800006

Time versus Space: Choice of Effort Metric Can Avoid Bias in Boat Electrofishing Catch per Unit Effort	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												While catch per unit effort (CPUE) is the most widely used metric for expressing and comparing boat electrofishing catch data, "effort" has been inconsistently defined. Boat electrofishing guidelines refer to both time- and distance-based metrics, with little consensus about the appropriateness of one over the other. Catch rate metrics that use time-based effort may potentially be biased by gear saturation due to handling time. We evaluated the potential for bias resulting from effort metric choice by comparing catch rates based on one temporal and two spatial effort metrics-time, shoreline length, and a GPS-based areal measurement-using 3 years of data from 288 sampling occasions when all three metrics were recorded simultaneously. We used pairwise comparisons to isolate the effect of effort metric choice and fit six candidate models to each potential pair of CPUE metrics: a simple linear model, four models with separate slopes for survey variables (lake, season, night or day, and habitat), and an asymptotic model. The best-fit model was asymptotic when the time-based CPUE metric was compared with both space-based metrics, and the linear model accounting for habitat was the best-fit model for the comparison between both spatial methods. These results indicate that using a time-based measure of effort resulted in hyperstable CPUE when fish densities were high due to gear saturation. By comparison, spatial measures of effort were robust to changes in fish density. Observed habitat-based variation in the relationship between the two spatial metrics suggests that a CPUE measurement based on shoreline distance is adequate for assessing trends in abundance within waters or areas with homogenous habitat but not locations with contrasting conditions. We recommend the use of an areal-based effort metric due to its robustness to gear saturation, comparability between waters, and potential for incorporating other variables that influence the performance of CPUE.					; Marcy-Quay, Benjamin/KFA-9607-2024	Marcy-Quay, Benjamin/0000-0001-6141-9719; Jirka, Kurt/0009-0008-6751-3296; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2019	39	6					1207	1216		10.1002/nafm.10351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10351		DEC 2019											WOS:000500681800001

Described here are the first in-depth surveys for C. siamensis in Laos with new field data on ecology and conservation. Small breeding populations of C. siamensis are confirmed to persist in Laos. During surveys between 2003 and 2008, C. siamensis was recorded in 13 sites of six river systems, where at least 36 individuals (1-11 per site) were documented. In all sites, crocodile densities and recruitment rates were extremely low. Eight nests were recorded among the first wild nests of C. siamensis to be reported. Perennial, thickly vegetated floodplain lakes are critical dry-season refugia and breeding habitats for C. siamensis in Laos. Opportunistic collection of crocodiles by local communities was observed, and at all sites there is increasing degradation of floodplain lakes for agriculture or economic development. National crocodile records were compiled and indicate that, historically, C. siamensis was widespread in lowland riverine and palustrine habitats of Laos, with most records from Central and South Laos in the Mekong Plain. These records also suggest that a severe range decline has occurred over the past century, although most wetlands remain unsurveyed for crocodiles. Crocodylus siamensis is probably now extirpated from the Lao Mekong and many other wetlands. Remnant C. siamensis populations in Laos are of global importance. All documented breeding sites, and most confirmed national records, are in rural lands outside the national protected area system, and conservation efforts will require community-based approaches.																			0022-1511	1937-2418				MAR	2013	47	1					41	65		10.1670/11-157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1670/11-157													WOS:000327903300007
J	Hessen, DO; Bakkestuen, V; Walseng, B				Hessen, Dag O.; Bakkestuen, Vegar; Walseng, Bjorn			Energy input and zooplankton species richness	ECOGRAPHY												What are the relative contribution of temperature and solar irradiance as types of energy deliveries for species richness at the ecosystem level? In order to reveal this question in lake ecosystems, we assessed zooplankton species richness in 1891 Norwegian lakes covering a wide range in latitude, altitude, and lake area. Geographical variables could largely be replaced by temperature-related variables, e.g. annual monthly maximum temperature or growth season. Multivariate analysis (PCA) revealed that not only maximum monthly temperature, but also energy input in terms of solar radiation were closely associated with species richness. This was confirmed by stepwise, linear regression analysis in which lake area was also found to be significant. We tested the predictive power of the "metabolic scaling laws" for species richness by regressing Ln of species richness over the inverse of the air temperature (in Kelvin), corrected for the activation energy (eV) as predicted by the Boltzmann constant. A significant, negative slope of 0.78 for ln richness over temperature, given as 1/kT, was found, thus slightly higher than the range of slopes predicted from the scaling law (0.60-0.70). Temperature basically constrained the upper bound of species number, but it was only a modest predictor of actual richness. Both PCA-analysis and linear regression models left a large unexplained variance probably due to lake-specific properties such as catchment influence, lake productivity, food-web structure, immigration constraints or more stochastic effects.

It changes the natural structure, flow process, and correlative environment of rivers. However, there is little analysis of the multiple impacts of small floodgate operation on the water environment in river networks and of the regulation patterns of urban floodgate infrastructure on pollution. In this paper, a one-dimensional hydrodynamic-water quality model, MIKE 11, was used, taking Wuxi's two main pollutant indicators-the permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N)-to simulate the water quality response of Wuxi's river network based on different design solutions of urban floodgate infrastructure. The results show that among the three design scenarios, the order of the decreasing amplitude of the CODMn and NH3-N concentrations was as follows: 1.4 m design solution scenario > 2.1 m design solution scenario > 0.7 m design solution scenario. Meanwhile, under the 1.4 m scenario, the maximum decrease in the CODMn concentration reached 37.57%, and the maximum decrease in the NH3-N concentration reached 206%. In the entire river network system, the improvement in the water quality in the downstream area was significantly better than that in the upstream area. In addition, under the three scenarios of floodgate operation, the changes in pollutant concentrations during the flood season (June-September) were significantly lower than those during the dry season (October-February) and the flat water season (March-May). The research results can provide theoretical support and new ideas for future research on the ecological operation of small floodgates and related research on the water environment effect.

Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a well-developed Earth observation technology in the last two decades. This study investigated the feasibility of extracting surface deformation in complex and diverse geomorphic landscape regions using ascending-descending orbit combination synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of frozen soil deformation and its relationship with climate change were further analyzed. A total of 110 Sentinel-1A ascending and descending SLC images from October 2017 to May 2021 were employed to cover the Qinghai-Tibet engineering corridor. A time-series InSAR (TS-InSAR) method based on a small baseline strategy and backscattering characteristics analysis was developed to estimate the surface deformation in the LOS directions. Then, combined with the geometric parameters of the SAR system, the 2-D deformation results of frozen soil were calculated. Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data gained from the QHTT Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) reference station was used for validation, demonstrating good agreement in displacement rates and time series. Our study has observed the seasonal components of the GNSS and TS-InSAR results based on a time-series decomposition model. It was revealed that both sets of results are consistent with the existing climate change law, which can reflect the freeze-thaw cycle of frozen soil.

Artificial Displacement Alters Movement Behavior of a Terrestrial Amphibian	HERPETOLOGICA												Homing abilities have been widely documented in amphibians, but it remains unclear whether individuals have homing tendencies in the absence of motivational cues related to breeding and site fidelity. We tested whether artificial displacement would affect the movement behavior of a nonphilopatric terrestrial amphibian, the Fowler's Toad (Anaxyrus fowleri), within its home range and after its breeding season had ended. We translocated 65 male and female Fowler's Toads from their initial points of capture a total of 104 times over one of three different distances (100 m, 250 m, and 500 m) and compared these toads' subsequent 24-h movements with those of a control group of 43 untranslocated toads. To shield the translocated toads from auditory, visual, and olfactory cues en route, we translocated them in opaque enclosed boxes and performed the experiment in the uniformly unobstructed landscape of the Lake Erie shoreline of Long Point, ON, Canada. We mainly investigated directionality bias as the orientation between control and translocated groups, homing tendency as the correlation between movements after translocation and translocation distance, and homing accuracy as the variation in distance between final and initial capture points. Our results provide clear evidence that translocation changes the movement behavior of these toads and that they possess homing tendencies outside of their breeding season. Toads had a strong directional bias to move in the opposite direction to the one in which they were artificially displaced, in contrast with the control group, which showed no directional bias among 61 recorded 24-h movements. This tendency for amphibians to home after artificial displacement might be a significant confounding factor in any procedure involving their relocation.																			0018-0831	1938-5099				SEP	2022	78	3					154	160		10.1655/Herpetologica-D-21-00031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1655/Herpetologica-D-21-00031													WOS:000853359200002

Cyanobacterial Bloom Phenology in Green Bay Using MERIS Satellite Data and Comparisons with Western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay	WATER												Cyanobacteria blooms have been reported to be increasing worldwide. In addition to potentially causing major economic and ecological damage, these blooms can threaten human health. Furthermore, these blooms can be exacerbated by a warming climate. One approach to monitoring and modeling cyanobacterial biomass is to use processed satellite imagery to obtain long-term data sets. In this paper, an existing algorithm for estimating cyanobacterial biomass previously developed for MERIS is validated for Green Bay using cyanobacteria biovolume estimates obtained from field samples. Once the algorithm was validated, the existing MERIS imagery was used to determine the bloom phenology of the cyanobacterial biomass in Green Bay. Modeled datasets of heat flux (as a proxy for stratification), wind speed, water temperature, and gelbstoff absorption along with in situ river discharge data were used to separate bloom seasons in Green Bay from bloom seasons in nearby cyanobacteria bloom hotspots including western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay. Of the ten-year MERIS dataset used here, the highest five years were considered "high bloom" years, and the lowest five years from biomass were considered "low bloom" years and these definitions were used to separate Green Bay. Green Bay had a strong relationship with gelbstoff absorption making it unique among the water bodies, while western Lake Erie responded strongly with river discharge as previously reported. Saginaw Bay, which has low interannual bloom variability, did not exhibit a largely influential single parameter.					; Litaker, Richard/AAH-2036-2021; De+Stasio, Bart/W-9030-2019; Hood, Raleigh/AGW-0453-2022; Stumpf, Richard/L-5237-2019	Stumpf, Richard/0000-0001-5531-6860; Wynne, Timothy/0000-0001-7282-0866; DeStasio, Bart/0000-0002-8635-7355; 														2073-4441				SEP	2022	14	17							2636	10.3390/w14172636	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14172636													WOS:000851948900001

Such studies of small, open lakes are important because delta(L) may show large responses to weather-driven hydrological variability. A delta(L) sequence was simulated for three-year and five-day interval data from Taozi Lake, a small, open lake in Changsha, in the East Asian monsoon region of China. The MBMs performed well, with the optimal model explaining 90% of the observed delta(L) variability. However, it was necessary to parameterize the precipitation input by increasing the lake water depth during heavy precip-itation events to capture the observed sharp decreases in delta(L). We found that the MBMs using air temperature and the equilibrated atmospheric vapor delta O-18 (delta(A)) produced a more negative delta(L) compared to the model using the surface water temperature and the observed delta(A), and that the equilibrated delta(A) was somewhat arbitrary, which introduced a large error in the model output. A sensitivity test highlighted the importance of the seasonal variability of hydrometeorological and isotopic variables to reproduce the observed delta(L) variability. Additionally, the simulated average delta(L) showed a similar pattern of variation to the meteorological variables shifted by different ratios, but for the relative humidity, there was only a narrow window within which a realistic delta(L) series could be reproduced. Our results show that a realistic MBM can be established based on long-term observations, with implications for studies of hydrologic processes and paleoclimate reconstruction.

In this study, we investigated the species diversity, life-form composition, origin, flowering season, and spatiotemporal distribution of spontaneous vegetation in the exhibition and education area of Tangdao Bay National Wetland Park using the quadrat survey method. There were 65 spontaneous association types and 210 spontaneous plant species, belonging to 151 genera and 44 families. The associations and species of spontaneous plants in roadside habitats were found to be the highest. In addition, many species were found in woodland and lakeside habitats, whereas the lowest number of species were found in coastal habitats. The life-form composition included 76 annual and 94 perennial herb species. These plants were of various origins. There were 160 native, 9 domestically introduced, 2 introduced alien, and 39 invasive alien plant species, which predominantly came from the Americas. A single peak was observed from March to November for the spontaneous plant species that were in their growing season, including those of different life forms and from various sources. The same was true for spontaneous plants in their flowering season. During their growing season, the number of spontaneous plant species was highest during September and, during their flowering season, the number of species was highest in July. From April to September, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index for spontaneous vegetation in the roadside habitat was the highest, followed by those for the woodland and lakeside habitats, and that of the coastline habitat was the lowest. The monthly average Shannon-Wiener diversity index for spontaneous plant associations in the four habitats also varied, with a single peak. The diversity of spontaneous plants and alien invasive plants in Tangdao Bay National Wetland Park is high. The wise use and protection of spontaneous flowering plants with long ornamental seasons can effectively reduce the maintenance costs, resource consumption, and energy requirements of the park. Spontaneous plants should also be managed to reduce the harm from alien invasive plants in the park, and alien invasive plants should be removed from the park during their flowering seasons.																				1660-4601				SEP	2022	19	18							11665	10.3390/ijerph191811665	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811665								36141939					WOS:000859438100001

At present, there is a lack of inflow and water quality monitoring data for some rivers, resulting in limited accuracy of statistical results regarding water volume and external loading estimations. In this study, we used DYRESM to estimate the water volume entering Waihai of Lake Dianchi from 2007 to 2019 without historical hydrological observation data. Then, we combined this information with the monthly monitoring data of water quality to calculate the annual external loading. Our results showed that: (1) DYRESM could effectively capture the extreme changes of water level at Waihai, showing its reliable applicability to Lake Dianchi. (2) The average annual inflow of rivers entering Waihai was about 6.69 x 10(8) m(3). The fitting relationship between river inflow and precipitation was significant on annual scale (r = 0.74), with a higher inner-annual fitting coefficient between them (r = 0.98), thus suggesting that precipitation and its caused river inflows are the main water source for Waihai. (3) From 2007 to 2010, the river loadings remained at a high level. They decreased to 2445.44 t (total nitrogen, TN) and 106.53 t (total phosphorus, TP) due to a followed drought in 2011. (4) The river loading had annual variation characteristics. The contribution rates of TN and TP loading in the rainy season were 63% and 67% respectively. (5) Panlong River, Daqing River, Jinjia River, Xinbaoxiang River, Cailian River and Hai River were the main inflow rivers. Their loadings accounted for 81.3% (TN) and 80.3% (TP) of the total inputs. (6) River loadings have gradually reduced and the water quality of Waihai has continually improved. However, Pearson analysis results showed that the water quality parameters were not significantly correlated with their corresponding external loading at Waihai, indicating that there might be other factors influencing the water quality. (7) The contribution rates of internal release to the total loads of TN and TP at Waihai were estimated to be 7.6% and 8.9% respectively, suggesting that the reductions of both external and internal loading should be considered in order to significantly improve the water quality at Waihai of Lake Dianchi.

J	Rose, LE; Kuehl, SA				Rose, Lila E.; Kuehl, Steven A.			Recent sedimentation patterns and facies distribution on the Poverty Shelf, New Zealand	MARINE GEOLOGY												Modern sediment dispersal and accumulation on the Poverty Shelf off the Waipaoa River, New Zealand, is investigated using X-radiographic, radio-isotopic and physical property analyses of nearly 200 box and Kasten cores collected in January 2005 aboard the R/V Kilo Moana. The high-yield, small mountainous Waipaoa River empties onto a tectonically active, narrow margin and represents an important analog for shelf sedimentation in similar environments worldwide. X-radiographs and bulk-density measurements from a multi-sensor core logger show three distinct facies on the shelf where physical and/or biological factors dominate strata formation. Spatial distribution of these facies delineates a radial pattern with distance from the river mouth, from areas dominated by stratified layers on the inner shelf to mottled muds on the outer shelf, demonstrating a continuum of controls from wave reworking to episodic and extreme wet event sedimentation, despite a tectonic framework that supports rapid accumulation in two recently identified shelf depocenters. Analysis of short-lived Be-7 (t(1/2)=53 days) reveals a broad spatial distribution across- and along-shelf in surface sediments, suggesting rapid transport from the Waipaoa source. However, beryllium-7 inventories are consistent with centennial-scale trends observed by other researchers using longer-lived Pb-210 analyses, with highest inventories in the shelf depocenters. Box core bulk-density analyses show lower than average bulk densities within these depocenters, and higher than average bulk densities on the inner shelf and between the depocenters. These observations confirm rapid deposition of low-density muds in the depocenters, with higher bulk-density, possibly physically reworked sediments, remaining off the mouth of Poverty Bay and between the depocenters. Based on this single observational period, there appears to be no fundamental difference between seasonal and longer-term accumulation patterns on the Poverty Shelf. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here we present a spatiotemporal analysis of water quality in the harbour and its biological response from 1987 to 2007. Overall nutrient concentrations have decreased by 16 (SIRP), 26 (NH3-Tot) and 36% (TP) in the harbour, chl a concentrations have decreased by 16% and NO3/2 concentrations have increased by 27%. Hypoxia in the hypolimnion of Hamilton Harbour remains a common occurrence despite improvements ill surface water quality conditions. Seasonal patterns in Water quality in Hamilton Harbour are mainly driven by biological activity and show typical patterns observed in dimictic nutrient rich lakes. There is systematic spatial Variability in water quality in the harbour which is related to the proximity of point and non-point Sources; however, there is coherence among all stations sampled and similar temporal trends were observed for all stations. The biological response in the harbour suggests that phosphorus limited algal growth is becoming more prevalent in Hamilton Harbour and the rate Of improvements in water quality Should accelerate in the near future following further reductions in phosphorus loadings.

However, this approach is less able to identify origins of individuals across broad areas where banding effort is low. We used stable-hydrogen isotope analyses of feathers (delta H-2(f)) from Mallards (Arras platyrhynchos) harvested during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 hunting seasons at Lake St. Clair (LSC), Ontario, Canada (n = 237 individuals). We created a feather isoscape and applied Bayesian assignment approaches to determine probability of origin. The proportion of hatch-year Mallards produced locally, i.e., at the same latitude as LSC, as opposed to farther north or south of LSC, ranged from 13.1% to 22.0% with almost no difference by sex. The proportion of after-hatch-year (AHY) birds that molted locally ranged from 3.5% to 11.7%, with slightly fewer local AHY females compared with local AHY males. Nearly all birds that did not originate locally came from latitudes to the north of LSC, and only 2 from south of LSC. Whether this pattern is representative of locations in the Great Lakes beyond our study area is unknown but is of great relevance for harvest management. As such, we are expanding our study with plans to examine isotope-based origins of Mallards and other harvested waterfowl species at locations throughout the Great Lakes region. Because of its unique potential to fill knowledge gaps, we advocate the use of the stable isotope technique in the management of North American waterfowl and encourage more research in this area.

However, such information is either unavailable or difficult to obtain. In this study, for the first time, we leverage Landsat imagery, ICESat-2 and airborne LiDAR data to develop time series of water body dynamics over the last 35 years (1987-2021) using machine learning method on a cloud computing platform for lakes identified as international importance in the Western District Lakes Ramsar site in Victoria, Australia. Our results reveal distinct seasonal (dry and wet) variation patterns and long-term changes in trends of lake water areas and levels in response to seasonal rainfall variations and regional climate changes for the periods of before, during and after the Millennium Drought when southeast Australia experienced unprecedented dry conditions. Lake water bodies have not recovered to the status of pre-Millennium Drought, and many per-manent Ramsar-listed lakes in the region have become to ephemeral lakes due to climate change. The outcome of this study provides a baseline to help understand the historical and ongoing status of the Ramsar-listed lakes in a warming and drying climate in support of the development of strategic plan to implement international obli-gations for wetlands protection under the Ramsar Convention.					zhang, zhenyu/HOA-8440-2023; Wright, Wendy/AAM-8059-2021	wright, wendy/0000-0003-3388-1273; 													1574-9541	1878-0512				NOV	2022	71								101789	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101789	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101789		AUG 2022											WOS:000859962000002

Niche differentiation of two sympatric species of Microdochium colonizing the roots of common reed	BMC MICROBIOLOGY												Background: Fungal endophyte communities are often comprised of many species colonizing the same host. However, little is known about the causes of this diversity. On the one hand, the apparent coexistence of closely related species may be explained by the traditional niche differentiation hypothesis, which suggests that abiotic and/or biotic factors mediate partitioning. For endophytes, such factors are difficult to identify, and are therefore in most cases unknown. On the other hand, there is the neutral hypothesis, which suggests that stochastic factors may explain high species diversity. There is a need to investigate to what extent each of these hypotheses may apply to endophytes. Results: The niche partitioning of two closely related fungal endophytes, Microdochium bolleyi and M. phragmitis, colonizing Phragmites australis, was investigated. The occurrences of each species were assessed using specific nested-PCR assays for 251 field samples of common reed from Lake Constance, Germany. These analyses revealed niche preferences for both fungi. From three niche factors assessed, i.e. host habitat, host organ and season, host habitat significantly differentiated the two species. M. bolleyi preferred dry habitats, whereas M. phragmitis prevailed in flooded habitats. In contrast, both species exhibited a significant preference for the same host organ, i.e. roots. Likewise the third factor, season, did not significantly distinguish the two species. Differences in carbon utilization and growth temperature could not conclusively explain the niches. The inclusion of three unrelated species of Ascomycota, which also colonize P. australis at the same locations, indicated spatio-temporal niche partitioning between all fungi. None of the species exhibited the same preferences for all three factors, i.e. host habitat, host organ, and time of the season. Conclusions: The fungal species colonizing common reed investigated in this study seem to exploit niche differences leading to a separation in space and time, which may allow for their coexistence on the same host. A purely neutral model is unlikely to explain the coexistence of closely related endophytes on common reed.

Periphyton chl-a densities and plant decline were significantly related to nutrient loading in all countries. Fish effects were significant in a few sites only, mostly because of their contribution to the nutrient pool. A saturation-response type curve in periphyton chl-a with nutrients was found, and northern lakes achieved higher densities than southern lakes. Nutrient concentration and phytoplankton chl-a necessary for a 50% plant reduction followed a latitudinal gradient. Total phosphorus values for 50% plant disappearance were similar from Sweden (0.27 mg L-1) to northern Spain (0.35 mg L-1), but with a sharp increase in southern Spain (0.9 mg L-1). Planktonic chl-a values for 50% plant reduction increased monotonically from Sweden (30 mu g L-1s) to Valencia (150 mu g L-1). Longer plant growing-season, higher light intensities and temperature, and strong water-level fluctuations characteristic of southern latitudes can lead to greater persistence of macrophyte biomass at higher turbidities and nutrient concentration than in northern lakes. Results support the evidence that latitudinal differences in the functioning of shallow lakes should be considered in lake management and conservation policies.					; Gomà, Joan/C-8485-2017; Fernández-Aláez, Camino/K-5292-2014; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/L-7321-2014; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Goma, Joan/C-8485-2017; Fernández-Aláez, Margarita/L-7321-2014; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016; van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Becares, Eloy/H-6361-2015	van de Bund, Wouter/0000-0002-2749-0850; Becares, Eloy/0000-0002-7123-3579; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/0000-0001-9385-1354; Goma, Joan/0000-0002-6312-1948; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Fernandez-Alaez, Margarita/0000-0003-3847-6613; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2008	42	4					561	574		10.1007/s10452-007-9126-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-007-9126-y													WOS:000260834900005
J	Feldman, HR; Franseen, EK; Joeckel, RM; Heckel, PH				Feldman, HR; Franseen, EK; Joeckel, RM; Heckel, PH			Impact of longer-term modest climate shifts on architecture of high-frequency sequences (cyclothems), Pennsylvanian of midcontinent USA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Pennsylvanian glacioeustatic cyclothems exposed in Kansas and adjacent areas provide a unique opportunity to test models of the impact of relative sea level and climate on stratal architecture. A succession of eight of these high-frequency sequences, traced along dip for 500 kin, reveal that modest climate shifts from relatively dry-seasonal to relatively wet-seasonal with a duration of several sequences (∼ 600,000 to 1 million years) had a dominant impact on facies, sediment dispersal patterns, and sequence architecture. The climate shifts documented herein are intermediate, both in magnitude and duration, between previously documented longer-term climate shifts throughout much of the Pennsylvanian and shorter-term shifts described within individual sequences. Climate indicators are best preserved at sequence boundaries and in incised-valley fills of the lowstand systems tracts (LST). Relatively drier climate indicators include high-chroma paleosols, typically with pedogenic carbonates, and plant assemblages that are dominated by gymnosperms, mostly xerophytic walchian conifers. The associated valleys are small (&LT; 2 km wide and &LT; 11 in deep) and are commonly filled with locally derived limestone clasts, which indicate small drainage networks. Relatively wetter climates are indicated by locally preserved paleosols exhibiting both low-chroma and high-chroma variants, common coals, and plant assemblages that are dominated by fern foliage, seed ferns, and sphenopsids. The incised-valley fills associated with these facies are large (&GT; 4 km wide and &GT; 20 m deep), and dominated by quartz sandstones derived from distant source areas, reflecting large drainage networks. Transgressive systems tracts (TST) in all eight sequences generally are characterized by thin, extensive limestones and thin marine shales, suggesting that the dominant control on TST facies distribution was the sequestration of siliciclastic sediment in updip positions. Highstand systems tracts (HST) were significantly impacted by the intermediate-scale climate cycle in that HSTs from relatively drier climates consist of thin marine shales overlain by extensive, thick regressive limestones, whereas HSTs from relatively wetter climates are dominated by thick marine shales. Previously documented relative sea-level changes do not track the climate cycles, indicating that climate played a role distinct from that of relative sea-level change. These intermediate-scale modest climate shifts had a dominant impact on sequence architecture. This independent measure of climate and relative sea level may allow the testing of models of climate and sediment supply based on modern systems.

Patterns and predictability in the intra-annual organic carbon variability across the boreal and hemiboreal landscape	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Factors affecting total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in 215 watercourses across Sweden were investigated using parameter parsimonious regression approaches to explain spatial and temporal variabilities of the TOC water quality responses. We systematically quantified the effects of discharge, seasonality, and long-term trend as factors controlling intra-annual (among year) and inter-annual (within year) variabilities of TOC by evaluating the spatial variability in model coefficients and catchment characteristics (e.g. land cover, retention time, soil type). Catchment area (0.18-47,000 km(2)) and land cover types (forests, agriculture and alpine terrain) are typical for the boreal and hemiboreal zones across Fennoscandia. Watercourses had at least 6 years of monthly water quality observations between 1990 and 2010. Statistically significant models (p < 0.05) describing variation of TOC in streamflow were identified in 209 of 215 watercourses with a mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index of 0.44. Increasing long-term trends were observed in 149 (70%) of the watercourses, and intra-annual variation in TOC far exceeded inter-annual variation. The average influences of the discharge and seasonality terms on intra-annual variations in daily TOC concentration were 1.4 and 1.3 mg l(-1) (13 and 12% of the mean annual TOC), respectively. The average increase in TOC was 0.17 mg l(-1) year(-1) (1.6% year(-1)). Multivariate regression with over 90 different catchment characteristics explained 21% of the spatial variation in the linear trend coefficient, less than 20% of the variation in the discharge coefficient and 73% of the spatial variation in mean TOC. Specific discharge, water residence time, the variance of daily precipitation, and lake area, explained 45% of the spatial variation in the amplitude of the TOC seasonality. Because the main drivers of temporal variability in TOC are seasonality and discharge, first-order estimates of the influences of climatic variability and change on TOC concentration should be predictable if the studied catchments continue to respond similarly.

Environmental remodelling of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission: Rise of the anoxia-tolerant turtle brain	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Climate cooling over the past one hundred thousand years has resulted in seasonal ice cover at northern and southern latitudes that has selected for hypoxia and anoxia tolerance in some species, such as freshwater turtles. At the northern reaches of their range, North American freshwater turtles spend 4 months or more buried in the mud bottom of ice covered lakes and ponds. From a comparative perspective this gives us the opportunity to understand how an extremely oxygen-sensitive organ, such as the vertebrate brain, can function without oxygen for long periods. Brain function is based on complex excitatory (on) and inhibitory (off) circuits involving the major neurotransmitters glutamate and, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) respectively. When a mammalian brain becomes anoxic, glutamate levels rise within minutes resulting in excitotoxic cell death which does not occur in anoxic turtle brain. The response in turtle brain has been remodelled - GABA levels rise rapidly resulting in large inhibitory GABA receptor currents and inhibition of glutamate receptor function that together depress neuronal activity.

J	Zhong, X; Jacquet, S				Zhong, Xu; Jacquet, Stephan			Differing assemblage composition and dynamics in T4-like myophages of two neighbouring sub-alpine lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Bacteriophages play an important role in plankton population dynamics and biogeochemical cycling, but their community dynamics and diversity are still poorly known, especially in fresh waters. 2. We conducted a 1-year investigation of the T4-like bacteriophages in the surface waters of two Western European peri-alpine lakes (lakes Annecy and Bourget), using fingerprinting and cloning-sequencing approaches targeting the major capsid protein g23 gene. 3. Our results suggest that T4-like bacteriophages are diverse (we found several new sequences) and differed substantially between the two lakes. Further, these phages displayed seasonal patterns with marked shifts in community composition. 4. Examining the dynamics of some individual constituents (e. g. DGGE bands), we found that (i) the majority of these myoviruses were rare (mean relative abundance <1%) and only a few were abundant (mean relative abundance >5%); (ii) the dominance of the most abundant DGGE bands changed throughout the year and their dynamics were very different between the two lakes; (iii) only a few bands (e. g. <20%) were detectable throughout the year and their proportion was higher in the oligomesotrophic Lake Bourget. 5. Our results suggest a highly dynamic T4-like myoviral assemblage. T4-like-viruses seem to conform to a standard model of community organisation and a common type of species abundance curve, with mainly rare organisms that occasionally may become abundant (termed a 'seed bank' for virus assemblages).

Additionally, a basic knowledge of breeding ecology is required before other types of studies may be conducted, such as physiology or conservation. In North East Asia, Dryophytes japonicus is distributed from Japan to Mongolia, where its breeding ecology is unknown. The objectives of this study were to understand the breeding requirements of D. japonicus in this part of its range. We collected data for Dryophytes japonicus at 56 sites located within 23 independent localities in Northern Mongolia during the breeding season 2017. The data collected included habitat type and co-occurring amphibian, fishes and bird species. Our results show that the species prefers circa 70 m long oxbow lakes for breeding, while habitat characteristics, water quality and co-occurring species were not significantly associated with the occurrence of the species. We therefore conclude that D. japonicus is behaviourally plastic in Mongolia, as it is in other portions of its range, and that the species can use several types of environments and co-occur with different species at its breeding sites. Corvus dauuricus was the only bird species significant predicting the occurrence of D. japonicus, likely because of overlapping ecological preferences.

AQUATIC BOTANY												The mute swan (Cygnus olor Gmelin) is one of the largest herbivorous waterbirds in the world. Its population increased dramatically over the last decades in Western Europe, leading to concerns about its potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. Indeed, swan consequences on fishponds remain poorly investigated, although fishpond animal communities and economic value both largely depend on aquatic macrophytes. We carried out an experiment in the Dombes region (Eastern France) with 96 exclosures on 24 fishponds. Our aim was to assess the impact of swan grazing on aquatic macrophyte presence, abundance and community structure (diversity and evenness) during the growing season (April to July). We also considered the potential effect of swan stay (i.e. number of swan days ha(-1)) and nutrient availability on macrophyte depletion. Swan grazing negatively affected the presence and abundance (% cover) of macrophyte beds, particularly at high swan density. No significant effect on dry biomass was found. Furthermore, swan grazing negatively affected community structure, suggesting that mute swan promoted the dominance of a few species in macrophyte communities. Whatever the macrophyte variable considered, nutrient availability in fishponds did not affect macrophyte depletion rate. It is speculated that both the repeated use of the same fishponds by birds and their expansion within the landscape may lead to more acute and broader consequences for macrophyte beds over the longer term.

Protistan grazing impact on both heterotrophic bacteria and PCya was mainly due to NF, which contributed up to 96% of the microbial grazing. There was a clear selection of FLA by protists. PCya represented the main carbon source for both flagellates and ciliates in the mixolimnion, accounting for an average of 83% of the total carbon obtained from the ingestion of picoplanktonic organisms. Protists were the main consumers of particulate primary production (46-74% depending on season). Significant seasonal variation of grazing rates (0.011-0.041 h(-1)) was found, chiefly following variation of PCya production and biomass. Assuming a growth efficiency of 0.4, total protozoan production varied seasonally (189-313 g C m(-2) day(-1)) and was roughly half of particulate phytoplankton production. This study provides evidence that NF and PCya were tightly coupled in Lake Tanganyika and that herbivory by protists may be one of the reasons why this great lake has high productivity. Our results bring support to the idea that microbial herbivory is a major process in oligotrophic freshwater systems.					; Sarmento, Hugo/W-3805-2019; Sarmento, Hugo/A-7655-2008; Stenuite, Stephane/B-7787-2008	Unrein, Fernando/0000-0002-8592-1858; Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Sarmento, Hugo/0000-0001-5220-7992; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				AUG	2011	62	2					314	323		10.1007/s00248-011-9817-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-011-9817-8								21336683					WOS:000293964000007

Isolation by time and habitat and coexistence of distinct host races of the common cuckoo	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY												Isolation by time occurs when different populations of a single species reproduce at different times and thereby reduce the probability of interbreeding, potentially causing divergent adaptation to timing of reproduction, eventually resulting in ecological species separated by timing of reproduction. We analysed extensive data on timing of reproduction by different host races of the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus that is an obligate brood parasite laying eggs in the nests of many different species of passerine birds. Because different hosts breed at different times, specific host races of cuckoos have adapted to specific hosts by laying eggs when nests of these hosts are available, and such divergence may be further exaggerated by differences in timing of breeding among host races with similar habitat requirements. Host species accounted for a quarter of the variance in timing of breeding by the cuckoo. Common cuckoos reproduced at a similar, but narrower subset of dates as did possible hosts, showing that only a fraction of hosts with specific breeding dates were parasitized. Common cuckoo eggs laid in the 'right' kind of nests, phenotypically matching the eggs of the host, were laid later during the season than cuckoo eggs laid in the 'wrong' kind of nests where the eggs did not mimic those of the host. Pairs of sympatric cuckoo host races differed more in timing of breeding than pairs of allopatric host races, and pairs of cuckoo host races with similar breeding habitat differed more in breeding date than pairs of cuckoo host races with dissimilar habitat, as expected from reproductive character displacement. These findings are consistent with cuckoo host races being isolated by timing of breeding and habitat.

Their unsaturation ratios have been proposed to have great potential for cold-season paleotemperature reconstructions. However, recent study based on the next-generation sequencing has found that there is high level of genetic diversity in Group 1 Isochrysidales, with two main subclades Groups 1a and 1b. It is still unclear whether variable mixtures of different Group 1 subclades can significantly affect the LCA-based paleotemperature proxies in freshwater lake sediment records. Here we investigated LCA distributions and haptophyte-specific 18S rRNA sequences from a sediment core in Tuofengling Tianchi (a freshwater volcanic lake) of northeastern China using a combination of lipid biomarker and next-generation sequencing analyses. We recover 386 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from the studied sediment samples, 11 of which are affiliated with the LCA-producing Isochrysidales. Our phylogenetic analysis identifies that all LCA-producing Isochrysidales belong to Group 1 phylotype (Groups 1a and 1b subclades included), with Group la being the dominant subclade in most samples. The phylotype is strongly supported by the LCA evidence of two C-37 tri-unsaturated alkenone isomers, with RIK37 (ratio of isomeric ketones of C-37 chain length) of similar to 0.57-0.60. Groups 1a and 1b in our sediment core display significant downcore variations in the relative abundances, with Group 1a ranging from 32% to 100%. However, such highly variable mixtures are not a dominant factor in affecting the values of LCA-based on temperature proxies (U-37(K), (U38Et)-Et-K, and R3b) in our sediment core. Our study provides the sedimentary evidence that Group 1 LCAs elude species-mixing effects and highlight the potential importance of Group 1 LCAs from freshwater lakes in quantitatively reconstructing past temperature changes.

The Elephant Marsh, Malawi - Part 1: reconstruction of the historic hydromorphology	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The Elephant Marsh lies on the floodplain of the lower Shire River, in southern Malawi. It is both a cultivated, seasonal floodplain and an area of permanent shallow lakes. The marsh is highly biodiverse, has a productive fishery and supports the livelihoods of a large human population. Chronicles and hand-drawn sketches by 19th-century explorers and subsequent travellers describing the marsh landscape were used to develop an account of the marsh's historic hydromorphology. These anecdotal accounts are supported by Shire River outflows from Lake Malawi, inferred from observed water levels in the lake from c. 1900. Records show that the marsh has experienced regular periods of drying out, followed by periods of greater inundation than it currently experiences. Long-term hydrological trends have been accompanied by anthropogenic influences such as catchment degradation and embankment construction, which have altered sedimentation patterns in the marsh. The marsh exhibits traits of resilience to natural long-term climate change through its ability to return to a similar state during wet periods, even following prolonged dry periods. Over relatively short time frames, however, the ecology of the marsh, as described when it was declared a RAMSAR site in 2017, likely has low resistance to hydrological regimes that are sensitive to climate change. An appreciation of long-term climate and recent human-induced changes afforded a unique opportunity for contextualising its hydromorphological trends within the Anthropocene.

Isotopic ecology of the modern land snail Cerion, San Salvador, Bahamas:: Preliminary advances toward establishing a low-latitude island paleoenvironmental proxy	PALAIOS												The isotopic ecology of terrestrial snails from tropical island settings is not known despite the importance of such data sets for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. In this study, variations in carbon (C-13/C-12) and oxygen (O-18/O-16) isotope ratios obtained during whole-shell and sequential-rib analyses of the modern land snail, Cerion, reveal a record of diet and local environment on San Salvador, Bahamas. The mean delta C-13 value of adult Cerion shells collected from C-4 vegetation is higher by 1.0 parts per thousand relative to snails collected from C-3 plants, suggesting that carbon isotopes in shell carbonate reflect the dominant plant type in the diet, though the broad range of shell carbonate delta C-13 confirms a varied diet for this genus. The mean delta O-18 values of adult Cerion shells collected from the west coast of San Salvador are 0.8 parts per thousand higher than those collected from the east coast of the island . This difference may reflect the incorporation of water vapor derived from O-18-rich hypersaline lakes located in the island's western interior. Sequential-rib analysis of one adult Cerion shell reveals variations in delta C-13 and delta O-18 values through ontogeny that may reflect changes in food source and rainfall seasonality, respectively. This study lays the groundwork for future studies to establish fossil Cerion as a valuable paleoenvironmental proxy for San Salvador and the Bahamas.

Location Fermoscandia north of about 58 degrees N and neighbouring parts of NW Russia. Methods Phenology data on birch from 15 research stations and the half-monthly GIMMS-NDVI data set with 8 x 8 km(2) resolution from the period 1982-2002 were used to characterize the growing season. To link surface phenology with NDVI data, new algorithms on a pixel-by-pixel basis that show high correlation with phenophases on birch were developed. Then, time-integrated values (TI NDVI) during the phenologically defined growing season were computed to produce a bioclimatological map of Fermoscandia, which was tested and correlated with growing degree days (GDD) obtained from 20 meteorological stations. The map was also compared vs. traditional bioclimatic maps, and analysed for error factors distorting NDVI values. Results The correlation between GDD and TI NDVI data during the phenologically defined growing season was very high. Therefore, the TI NDVI map could be presented as a bioclimatic map reflecting GDD. However, several major areas have interfering factors distorting NDVI values, such as the pixel heterogeneity caused by the altitudinal mosaic in western Norway, the mosaic of lakes in southeastern Finland, and the agriculture-dominated areas in southern Fermoscandia. Main conclusions TI NDVI data from the phenologically defined growing season during 1982-2002 in Fermoscandia can be processed as a bioclimatic map reflecting GDD, except for the areas distorting NDVI values by their strong ground-cover heterogeneity.																			1466-822X	1466-8238				JUL	2006	15	4					416	430		10.1111/j.1466-822x.2006.00234.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-822x.2006.00234.x													WOS:000239310400010

Spatio-temporal trend analysis of precipitation data over Rwanda	SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL												This study applies a number of statistical techniques in an attempt to quantify the magnitude, and to determine the significance of trends in the number of rainy days and mean rainfall over Rwanda on a monthly, seasonal and annual timescale. Trend analysis of the number of rainy days (1961-1992) was performed on daily values collected from 25 weather stations and the rainfall trends (1935-1992) were analysed using aggregated mean monthly data from 28 weather stations. The magnitude and significance of trends at 95% interval level derived from the slopes of the regression lines are presented spatially with the help of maps. It was observed that on average, there was a steady decline in the frequency of rainfall across the country. A significant incline was registered mainly over the northern region and the number of rainy days decreased significantly over the eastern and central plateau. The mean rainfall was found to increase sharply in most parts, especially in the regions around Kivu Lake during the short rainy seasons. The central region of Rwanda displayed a diminishing trend in rainfall totals in January and February. At the same time, the wet areas located in the highlands and around Kivu Lake are becoming wetter compared to the rest of the country. The highlands were consequently experiencing more flooding, with the eastern lowlands and the central plateau becoming warmer. These phenomena have an adverse effect on crop production, as they cause failure and/or destruction.

The surface sediment samples from four stations in the Siddikli Dam Lake were collected seasonally from September 2015 to August 2016. Concentrations of selected metals were determined using ICP-MS. Descriptive statistical analysis including One-way ANOVA, significance (0.05) was done. Important differences in the mean values were tested using Tukey's multiple range test. Moreover, Principal component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to the data of the dam lake. The degree of metal contamination is compared with the standard shale values. The result of sediment enrichment factor, pollution loading index, and geoaccumulation index reveals that the surface sediments of the dam lake are not polluted. Thus, this study aims to identify the main pollution factors as well as the regions of the lake that are at risk. Moreover, significant correlations between the measured concentrations of the all heavy metals in the sediment samples were observed. It can be concluded that the heavy metal pollution level is low at Siddikli Dam Lake, however it will be good to adopt protective measures before it is too late.

Differential Gene Expression in Response to Salinity and Temperature in a Haloarcula Strain from Great Salt Lake, Utah	GENES												Haloarchaea that inhabit Great Salt Lake (GSL), a thalassohaline terminal lake, must respond to the fluctuating climate conditions of the elevated desert of Utah. We investigated how shifting environmental factors, specifically salinity and temperature, affected gene expression in the GSL haloarchaea, NA6-27, which we isolated from the hypersaline north arm of the lake. Combined data from cultivation, microscopy, lipid analysis, antibiotic sensitivity, and 16S rRNA gene alignment, suggest that NA6-27 is a member of the Haloarcula genus. Our prior study demonstrated that archaea in the Haloarcula genus were stable in the GSL microbial community over seasons and years. In this study, RNA arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP-PCR) was used to determine the transcriptional responses of NA6-27 grown under suboptimal salinity and temperature conditions. We observed alteration of the expression of genes related to general stress responses, such as transcription, translation, replication, signal transduction, and energy metabolism. Of the ten genes that were expressed differentially under stress, eight of these genes responded in both conditions, highlighting this general response. We also noted gene regulation specific to salinity and temperature conditions, such as osmoregulation and transport. Taken together, these data indicate that the GSL Haloarcula strain, NA6-27, demonstrates both general and specific responses to salinity and/or temperature stress, and suggest a mechanistic model for homeostasis that may explain the stable presence of this genus in the community as environmental conditions shift.																			2073-4425					JAN	2018	9	1							52	10.3390/genes9010052	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes9010052								29361787					WOS:000424116500049

Aquatic species diversity (algae, invertebrates, and fish) at 9 different stations in freshwater, brackish water and marine ecosystems, and terrestrial species diversity (plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) in the surrounding wetland were studied seasonally in 2016. A total of 195 taxa of terrestrial vascular flora and 134 species of aquatic flora (97 species of phytoplankton, 37 species of benthic algae); a total of 23 macrobenthic invertebrate taxa from the lake and 131 invertebrate species from the sea were identified. Also, 4 fish, 14 reptiles, 3 amphibians and 71 bird species were observed in the study area. While one species of phytoplankton was determined as a new record for the Turkish aquatic flora, a total of 71 marine invertebrate species were reported for the first time in the marine fauna of Gokceada.

Remediation of a Beneficial Use Impairment at Bluffer's Park Beach in the Toronto Area of Concern	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Bluffer's Park Beach in the Toronto and Region Area of Concern had a history of beach postings often exceeding 80% of the beach season since the 1980s. A study applied expanded E. coli surveillance and microbial source tracking techniques in 2005-2007 to identify fecal pollution sources contributing to beach postings. Expanded surveillance in the beach vicinity identified significant E. coli hotspots in the foreshore beach sand (pore water max E. coli=255,000 CFU 100 ml(-1)) and associated with a marsh inland of the beach. During rain events, streams from the marsh (max E. coli=173,000 CFU 100 ml(-1)) and runoff from the parking lot (max E. coli=4100 CFU 100 ml(-1)) were observed to overflow across the beach to contaminate beach waters. Microbial source tracking using library-dependent (antibiotic resistance and rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting of E. coli isolates) and library-independent (human HF183 bacterial DNA marker) methods indicated the prevalence of animal fecal pollution sources at the beach rather than human sewage. These results were consistent with sanitary survey information, observations of wildlife in the marsh area, and Gulls and Canada Geese on the beach. In 2006, a bird management program was initiated, and remedial actions continued in advance of the 2008 bathing season to engineer a berm to prevent marsh runoff into beach water and re-direct parking lot drainage into the marsh. Since these remediation actions, Bluffer's Park Beach has been posted less than 20% of each beach season, and it was awarded a Blue Flag accreditation in 2011.

Almost all of the drinking water in urban area of Suzhou city is provided by the seven water plants. Every link of drinking water supply, including raw water, finished water and tap water were monitored. The results indicated that BPA and 4-NP were detected in all samples with the concentration of 0.067-0.118gL(-1) and 0.111-0.350gL(-1), respectively, while 4-t-OP could be detected in only a few raw water samples with the concentration lower than its limit of quantitation (LOQ). The levels of BPA and 4-NP in raw water were significantly different among three hydrographic periods and the highest concentration can be observed in dry period. The difference in removal efficiency of BPA and 4-NP in seven water plants was also observed among three hydrographic periods, e.g. relative higher in dry period for BPA and in flow period for 4-NP. Potential risk assessment hinted that BPA and 4-NP in raw water showed a low to medium and a medium to high risk respectively to aquatic environment, while in tap water, the health risk from BPA and 4-NP could be ignored on human.																			0306-7319	1029-0397					2018	98	10					921	937		10.1080/03067319.2018.1516213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2018.1516213													WOS:000445799400003

Maintenance and utilization of Rong Cave's water reservoir, as well as touristic cave use, require frequent human access to Rong Cave. Depending on the availability of seasonal drip water and the water level of the lake, the abundant clay-rich sediment in the back portion of Rong Cave and possible seepage of gas from deeper strata along geologic faults provide seasonally elevated concentrations of radon in cave air. Based on repeated measurements over 10 months in 2015 and 2016 of the concentrations of radon isotopes (Rn-222 and Rn-220, also called thoron) with a portable SARAD (R) RTM 2200 instrument (SARAD (R) GmbH, Germany), the human total annual inhalation dose was estimated according to the UNSCEAR (2000) algorithm. The result indicates that the radon-related radiation exposure is insignificant for short-term visitors but may reach similar to 1.8 mSv a(-1) for tour guides and similar to 25 mSv a(-1) for cave utility workers. The latter values exceed the IAEA-recommended safety threshold of 1 mSv a(-1) (IAEA, 1996). We recommend radiation monitoring for cave utility workers and tour guides. Prolonged human presence in Rong Cave should be avoided during periods of seasonally elevated radon concentrations.

The bacterial community composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Co-occurrence patterns among bacterial taxa and environmental variables were determined through network analysis. Overall, strong seasonal variation patterns of BCC were observed whilst the spatial variations of BCC were slight in the long-term observation. However, core species bacteria persisted throughout the annual variations. Network analysis showed that the highly connected operational taxonomic units in bacteria-environment network included both the numerically dominant taxa and some functional groups with low abundance, such as Methylophilaceae and Nitrospira. Co-occurrence networks further revealed that the correlations of bacteria-bacteria could be more critical than those between environment and bacteria in structuring microbial communities, and would be a crucial driving factor of BCC in Lake Taihu.																			0149-0451	1521-0529					2018	35	3					186	197		10.1080/01490451.2017.1348406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2017.1348406													WOS:000428125600003

Challenging the concept of Aboriginal mosaic fire practices in the Lake Eyre Basin	RANGELAND JOURNAL					18th Biennial Conference of the Australian-Rangeland-Society	APR, 2015	Alice Springs, AUSTRALIA					Mosaic burning is the deliberate creation of a mosaic of patches representing different fire histories. It is often recommended for management of Australia's natural landscapes, on the assumption that it enhances biodiversity and reduces fire hazard through increased spatial and temporal diversity of fuel loads and species composition. It is also suggested that such fire practices were used throughout Australia by traditionally living Aboriginal people. Although the creation of a patchwork of different fire histories may be an effective management tool in modern land management, the evidence for universal mosaic burning before European settlement deserves scrutiny. The records of explorers, early settlers and anthropologists relating to a large portion of the Lake Eyre Basin, particularly the Channel country and the Simpson Desert region, were examined. It is concluded that extensive gaps in the records of smokes and large fires are important and meaningful, and do not represent a failure to record fires. The case for universal mosaic burning in the region is not supported by the evidence although mosaic burning did occur in specific circumstances. Fire practices were shaped by complex and interacting factors including the vegetation and terrain type, for example the occurrence of spinifex-dominated sandhills or stony deserts; seasonal conditions and the presence or not of adequate fuel loads; how readily Aboriginal people could access country and their reasons for using or not using fire; the stocking of the pastoral country and spread of feral animals; and government policies about fire.					; Friedel, Margaret/AAR-5104-2020	Friedel, Margaret/0000-0002-8350-636X; 													1036-9872	1834-7541					2015	37	6			SI		623	630		10.1071/RJ15057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ15057													WOS:000367099600010

User requirements for the snow and land ice services - CryoLand	CRYOSPHERE												CryoLand (2011-2015) is a project carried out within the 7th Framework of the European Commission aimed at developing downstream services for monitoring seasonal snow, glaciers and lake/river ice primarily based on satellite remote sensing. The services target private and public users from a wide variety of application areas, and aim to develop sustainable services after the project is completed. The project has performed a thorough user requirement survey in order to derive targeted requirements for the service and provide recommendations for the design and priorities of the service. In this paper we describe the methods used, the major findings in this user survey, and how we used the results to design and specify the CryoLand snow and land ice service. The user requirement analysis shows that a European operational snow and land ice service is required and that there exists developed cryosphere products that can meet the specific needs. The majority of the users were mainly interested not only in the snow services, but also the lake/river ice products and the glacier products were desired.					; Metsämäki, Sari/AAX-5850-2021; Luojus, Kari/AAO-7912-2020; Pulliainen, Jouni/Y-4810-2019; Gustafsson, David/G-6729-2012	Metsamaki, Sari/0000-0002-9633-4376; Luojus, Kari/0000-0002-4066-6005; Gustafsson, David/0000-0002-2754-7415; Pulliainen, Jouni/0000-0003-1157-2920; 													1994-0416	1994-0424					2015	9	3					1191	1202		10.5194/tc-9-1191-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1191-2015													WOS:000360659200011

Vulnerability of groundwater resources to interaction with river water in a boreal catchment	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												A low-altitude aerial infrared (AIR) survey was conducted to identify hydraulic connections between aquifers and rivers and to map spatial surface temperature patterns along boreal rivers. In addition, the stable isotopic compositions (delta O-18, delta D), dissolved silica (DSi) concentrations and electrical conductivity of water in combination with AIR data were used as tracers to verify the observed groundwater discharge into the river system in a boreal catchment. Based on low temperature anomalies in the AIR survey, around 370 groundwater discharge sites were located along the main river channel and its tributaries (203 km altogether). On the basis of the AIR survey, the longitudinal temperature patterns of the studied rivers differed noticeably. The stable isotopes and DSi composition revealed major differences between the studied rivers. The groundwater discharge locations identified in the proximity of 12 municipal water intake plants during the low-flow seasons should be considered as potential risk areas for water intake plants during flood periods (groundwater quality deterioration due to bank infiltration), and should be taken under consideration in river basin management under changing climatic situations.

Spatial/Temporal Characterization and Risk Assessment of Trace Metals in Mangla Reservoir, Pakistan	JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Composite water samples were collected from different sites of Mangla reservoir, Pakistan, in premonsoon, monsoon, and postmonsoon seasons. The physicochemical parameters and trace/heavy metals were determined in all water samples. The results manifested significant seasonal variations among Co, Cr, Ni, and Pb and the metals exhibited highest contribution in premonsoon season except Mn. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) revealed considerable anthropogenic intrusions in the reservoir. Probable risk associated with the metals levels on human health was also evaluated using hazard quotients (HQ) by ingestion and dermal routes for adults and children. It was noted that Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, and Pb (HQ(ing) > 1) were the most important pollutants leading to noncarcinogenic concerns. The HQ(derm) levels of all metals were below unity, suggesting that these metals posed no hazards via dermal absorption, while the oral intake was the major exposure pathway. The largest contributors to chronic risks were Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, and Pb in all the seasons. Therefore, immediate measures should be taken for sustaining the healthy aquatic ecosystem.

Contrasting pelagic plankton in temperate Irish lakes: the relative contribution of heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and autotrophic components, and the effects of extreme rainfall events	INLAND WATERS												The mobilisation of energy from allocthonous carbon by heterotrophic bacterioplankton can be proportionally more important than autotrophic production in humic lakes. Moreover, increasing levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in many aquatic systems linked to increases in precipitation, which in turn may be related to changing climate, mean that this heterotrophic component of the food web may play an increasing role in the overall transfer and production of energy, particularly within peatland catchments. While such catchments are common in the temperate northwest Atlantic regions of Europe, studies describing the seasonal dynamics of the heterotrophic, mixotrophic, and autotrophic components of their aquatic food webs are rare. In this study, the biomass of these pelagic components was enumerated over 1 year in 2 oligotrophic lakes, both situated in peatland catchments in the west of Ireland but with contrasting DOC concentrations. Bacterial biomass dominated the pelagic food web of the more humic lake, Lough Feeagh, while autotrophic phytoplankton biomass was greatest in the clearwater lake, Lough Guitane. The biomass of potentially mixotrophic flagellates was also slightly larger in the Lough Guitane, while phagotrophic ciliate biomass was comparable between the 2 lakes. An extreme precipitation event led to a significant increase in bacterial biomass while simultaneously depressing autotrophic production for several months in the humic lake. Extreme precipitation in the clearwater lake also depressed autotrophic production but did not give rise to significant increases in bacterial biomass. This quantification of autotrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic components provides a vital first step in understanding how pelagic communities contribute to net ecosystem productivity, and thus how Irish peatland lakes may be affected by projected climate changes.					; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023	Jennings, Eleanor/0000-0002-9344-2056; de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2015	5	3					295	310		10.5268/IW-5.3.828	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-5.3.828													WOS:000358848300010
J	Zehrer, RF; Burns, CW; Flöder, S				Zehrer, Reglindis F.; Burns, Carolyn W.; Floeder, Sabine			Sediment resuspension, salinity and temperature affect the plankton community of a shallow coastal lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Climate change is predicted to cause an increasing frequency of storm tides, rising sea levels and water temperatures, and altered precipitation and run-off. Such changes are likely to influence turbidity, salinity and temperature regimes of coastal aquatic ecosystems. To determine possible effects on plankton communities of these ecosystems, we combined feeding experiments with a monitoring study of tidally influenced, polymictic Lake Waihola (New Zealand). The feeding experiments were carried out using dominant Daphnia carinata, and important taxa of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates. The field study encompassed the entire planktonic food web. Moderate levels of turbidity and salinity affected clearance and ingestion rates of D. carinata, HNF and oligotrich ciliates in our feeding experiments. Redundancy analysis identified sediment resuspension, salinity and temperature as important factors affecting the plankton communities in Lake Waihola. A wide variety of biota was affected by sediment resuspension and temperature. Fewer species responded to salinity, most likely due to unusually low salinities throughout the monitoring period. If global warming results in altered turbidity, salinity or temperature regimes in coastal aquatic ecosystems changes might be expected in the structure of their plankton communities, with potential consequences throughout the food web.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2015	66	4					317	328		10.1071/MF13221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF13221													WOS:000351621600004

Vulnerability to harvest by anglers differs across climate, productivity, and diversity clines	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We contrast catchability of walleye (Sander vitreus) and northern pike (Esox lucius) populations with angling fisheries across regions that differ twofold in growing-degree-days and productivity and sixfold in fish diversity. Populations of both species in Alberta, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Oneida Lake, New York, had density-dependent catchability with approximately tenfold higher catchability in Alberta than in the other regions when density was controlled for. There is no evidence that the higher catchability estimates for Alberta walleye and northern pike are due to differential spatial distributions, enhanced hook avoidance due to catch and release or to differential size structure of the populations, or to differences in harvest regulations. We argue that the most likely explanation for the tenfold higher catchability is increased hunger resulting in enhanced foraging activity in the region with a substantially shorter growing season, lower prey productivity, and lower prey community diversity. Regardless of the proximate causes, higher catchability of fish harvested in recreational fisheries in Alberta substantially increases their vulnerability to overharvest and collapse if angling effort is unabated.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2014	71	3					416	426		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2013-0336													WOS:000332461000009

Here we present a record of Holocene climate and glacier fluctuations inferred from the paleolimnology of small lakes near Istorvet ice cap in East Greenland. Calibrated radiocarbon dates of organic remains indicate deglaciation of the region before similar to 10,500 years BP, after which time the ice cap receded rapidly to a position similar to or less extensive than present, and lake sediments shifted from glacio-lacustrine clay to relatively organic-rich gyttja. The lack of glacio-lacustrine sediments throughout most of the record suggests that the ice cap was similar to or smaller than present throughout most of the Holocene. This restricted ice extent suggests that climate was similar to or warmer than present, in keeping with other records from Greenland that indicate a warm early and middle Holocene. Middle Holocene magnetic susceptibility oscillations, with a similar to 200-year frequency in one of the lakes, may relate to solar influence on local catchment processes. Following thousands of years of restricted extent, Istorvet ice cap advanced to within 365 m of its late Holocene limit at similar to AD 1150. Variability in the timing of glacial and climate fluctuations, as well as of sediment organic content changes among East Greenland lacustrine records, may be a consequence of local factors, such as elevation, continentality, water depth, turbidity, and seabirds, and highlights the need for a detailed spatial array of datasets to address questions about Holocene climate change.

J	Lora, JM				Lora, Juan M.			Moisture transport and the methane cycle of Titan's lower atmosphere	ICARUS												Titan's surface and lower atmosphere support a hydrologic cycle that influences various aspects of the icy moon's appearance and evolution. Here, we review the state of knowledge around this methane cycle, focusing on its relationship to the circulation of the troposphere and to the distribution of surface liquids. Titan's meridional circulation consists mainly of Hadley cells, with an intertropical convergence zone-in which clouds and precipitation are promoted-that oscillates with latitude seasonally. There are separate regions at the poles wherein precipitation occurs in summertime. Overall, the character of precipitation depends on the amount of liquid available to evaporate on the surface, and a realistic liquid distribution (that is, with liquids limited to polar regions) leads to highly sporadic seasonal precipitation. This also produces a latitudinal profile of near-surface humidity wherein the poles are more humid than the lower latitudes. The lower latitude humidity reflects the horizontal transport by the Hadley circulation, but is cut off from the high near-surface humidity at the poles. Polar moist convection humidifies the mid-levels and from there the low latitudes, and equatorward, downgradient transport of moisture is accomplished by traveling storm systems in the high mid-latitudes. These waves in some cases interact with the convection to communicate the effects of latent heating nearly globally. Separately, surface and subsurface hydrology are important processes that lead to the observed distribution of liquids in polar basins, and furthermore indicate the influence of a subsurface methane table interacting with the climate system. Precipitation at lower latitudes largely runs off or infiltrates into the surface; runoff at higher latitudes feeds some of the low-lying polar basins; and subsurface methane flow regulates the distribution of near-surface methane such that the seas are surface exposures of, and other polar areas sustain evaporation from, a shallow methane table. Finally, we discuss the possible long-term evolution of surface liquids, including the influence of Croll-Milankovitch cycles and their effect on atmospheric moisture transport by eddies; whether or not Titan's surface features indicate past cycling of polar liquids, slower secular trends, or something else entirely remains unresolved.																			0019-1035	1090-2643				NOV 1	2024	422								116241	10.1016/j.icarus.2024.116241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2024.116241		AUG 2024											WOS:001293579000001

Estimation of euphotic zone depth in shallow inland water using inherent optical properties and multispectral remote sensing imagery	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Euphotic zone depth (Z(eu)) is a key indicator of underwater light environment that regulates different biogeochemical and physical processes in aquatic ecosystem. Remote sensing approaches offer a unique opportunity to frequently monitor Z(eu), although its estimation from diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) requires depth profiles of the down-welling irradiance (E-d). Measuring E-d values at different water depths (i.e., E-d profiling) in shallow waterbodies is a challenging task with the available profiling equipment. In this study, K-d values were estimated from measured absorption coefficient (a) data at multiple locations in the Chilika lagoon, which is a shallow waterbody located in the eastern coast of India and is a prestigious Ramsar site. Specifically, remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), a values (wavelength: 400-715 nm at 4 nm interval), Secchi disc depth (Z(SD)), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) contents were measured during Oct. 07-08, 2018 and Feb. 02-08, 2019 in the Chilika lagoon. Atmospherically corrected Sentinel 2A/2B (S2A/S2B) MSI-R-rs data (level 2A) were then used to develop algorithms for mapping Z(eu) for the entire lagoon. Modeling results showed that R-rs values at band 4 (665 nm) or band 5 (704 nm) extracted from the S2A/S2B MSI data may be used to estimate K-d of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (observed range: 1.29 m(-1) to 10.74 m(-1)) with the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as low as 0.81 m(-1). However, uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction of S2A/S2B MSI-single band R-rs values are high when compared with in situ R-rs. Thus, a multivariate modeling approach was adopted with R-rs- band ratio and band difference variables selected by stepwise, forward, and backward variable selection method with p < 0.05. Modeling results showed that the band differences between band 2 and band 4 and band 3 and band 5 may be used to estimate K-d(PAR) with improved mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) while ensuring low uncertainty associated with atmospheric correction. Spatio-temporal dynamics from S2A/S2B MSI for 85 different dates during Jan. 2017 to June 2021 provided seasonal patterns for Z(eu) in the Chilika lagoon.

J	Zhang, YH; Yu, YL				Zhang, Yinghua; Yu, Yilei			Evaluating the impact of percolated reclaimed water from river-channel reservoir on groundwater using tracers in Beijing, Northern China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												As an increasingly important aspect of water management, historical dry river-channels, ponds or lakes are operated for the storage of reclaimed water as a landscape with the need for reuse of water. However, the percolated reclaimed water may have an adverse effect on groundwater quality. The aims of this work are to evaluate the potential for using various groundwater constituents or characteristics as tracers of percolated reclaimed water, to clarify the groundwater hydrochemical process with the effect of the reclaimed water recharge, and to estimate the degree to which the infiltrated reclaimed water has mixed with the native groundwater. Results obtained by comparing analysis between the dry season and wet season are presented based on multivariate statistics analysis, correlation of hydrochemical elements, and stable isotopes. The groundwater with the impact of reclaimed water was clustered together with higher Cl, K and NH4-N concentrations, lower Ca concentrations and more enriched heavy isotopes using unprecedentedly 3D-biplot; The water types of the groundwater change from Ca-Mg-HCO3-Cl, via Ca-Na-Mg-HCO3-Cl to Na-Ca-Mg-Cl-HCO3 with increasing reclaimed water percolated into the groundwater; the most useful tracers for evaluation of the fate and mixing of reclaimed water are chloride ion and oxygen-18 and chloride ion is more accurate than oxygen-18 to quantify the recharge source of the groundwater from the reclaimed water; using a two-end-member mixing model to calculate the reclaimed water discharged into the groundwater, the proportion of reclaimed water in groundwater is up to 94% near the unlined riverbed and up to 43% far from it. These results demonstrate the potential of the combined application of multivariate statistics analysis, traditional hydrochemical analysis and isotopes to assess the percolated reclaimed water in the groundwater, especially using 3D-biplot to determine the spatial water quality changes defined by the different factors.

Morphologic and sedimentologic patterns of active aeolian dune-fields on the east coast of MaranhAo, northeast Brazil	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The eastern portion of the MaranhAo coast is characterized by large active dune-fields located in a tropical setting. This article combines the analysis of dune-field morphologic patterns with the classical analysis of grain size and heavy minerals to study the sedimentary dynamics of the active aeolian system in this region. Based on the heavy mineral analysis, the main sedimentary suppliers feeding the system are the westward alongshore drift bringing sand from the coast east of the Parnaiba River mouth and the river itself. The absence of well-defined variation patterns of the two morphometric parameters studied, dune spacing and crest length, reflects complex sedimentary dynamics and transport pathways, inside the aeolian system, despite the unidirectional wind. During the wet season, the interdune plains are flooded and the system is intensely reworked by intermittent drainages. During the dry season, the deposits formed by the drainages and interdune lakes become temporary internal sedimentary sources for the system. Due to this combined aeolian-fluvial transport, the sediment source area has a planar geometry, with contributions from the beach and interdune plains, and not linear as expected in a typical case of source only in the beach. The areal limits of the dune-fields is the main boundary condition controlling the dune-field patterns, as dune spacing and crest length, by changing the sedimentary inflow-outflow balance and interactions between migration dunes.

The highest average value of Sigma PAHs was detected as 295.28 ng/g dw in March, followed by 240.91 ng/g dw in June and 165.81 ng/g dw in September. Source characterization studies based on the analysis of diagnostic ratio (triangular plot method) suggested that the PAHs in sediments from Changdang Lake were mainly from the mixed combustion source of biomass and petroleum, and the origins of PAHs in different sampling sites have a great deal of temporal and spatial variability during different water seasons. Redundancy analysis was applied to identify the impact factors and the possible relationship between PAHs and environmental parameters. The predicted results showed that the main factors impacting PAHs temporal distribution were temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential, while conductivity showed secondary impacts on the PAHs distribution. Risk assessment of PAHs in sediments was carried out based on the US Sediments Quality Guidelines (SQGs). By comparing the present study results with SQGs standard values results showed that the adverse effects are not expected at the present levels of PAHs contamination observed in the sediments from Changdang Lake.

In this paper we describe a condition in which the bloom is of multi-year duration consisting of different morphologies of a single cyanobacteria species. Lake Catemaco, Veracruz, Mexico maintained a year-round massive (108 trichomes L-1) population of potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria, Cylindrospermopsis spp. The trichomes are present as straight and coiled morphotypes. The relative trichome morphology abundance varied with rainy (June-October) and dry seasons (November-May), but total trichome abundance did not vary. Coiled trichomes and heterocytes (occurring only on coiled trichomes) were significantly more abundant, both absolutely and relatively, during the dry season. Both coiled trichome and heterocyte mean volumes were significantly smaller during the rainy season than during the dry season. Biovolumes were largest in January when water temperature was 5 degrees C cooler suggesting buoyancy as a morphology-determining factor. However, with a more than three-fold lower TIN concentration during the dry season, we hypothesized that the coiled morphotype became abundant primarily because it formed heterocytes, which the straight morphotype did not. Spatial trichome and heterocyte abundance differences were small among the 15 lake sites (average CV for all dates: 20%). However, there was a pattern of increased heterocyte and coiled trichome abundance from lake inflow, as a nitrogen source, to outflow during the rainy season. The total volume of heterocytes per litre of lake water increased progressively four-fold from a minimum early in the rainy season to a maximum at the end of the dry season. Morphological diversity, as seen in Lake Catemaco, can partially compensate for the lack of species diversity in determination of community structure.

To explore the development of cyanobacteria in response to large-scale reservoir operation, a 2-year, biweekly monitoring program was implemented from 2007 to 2009 in the Pengxi River Backwater Area, a typical tributary of the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir. The data were divided into 3 subsets based on the seasonal operations of the reservoir. During the low-water operation period, temperature stratified in the water column, and intensive rainfall brought suspended solids and nutrients into the Pengxi River Backwater Area. These drivers led to relatively high levels of total particulate matter and low levels of euphotic depth in the water column compared with both the high-water operation period and reservoir discharge period. During these 2 periods, increases in water temperature stimulated the growth of most cyanobacteria. We concluded that the large-scale operation caused structurally different habitats in the Pengxi River Backwater Area, related to water depth, reservoir volume, and nutrient dynamics. These impacts were closely linked to seasonal effects, such as rainfall, river flow, and water temperature, which resulted in differences in habitat among reservoir operation stages.					yu, yingying/GRR-7851-2022														2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	1					77	88		10.5268/IW-6.1.803	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.1.803													WOS:000371809400007

Seasonal evolution of supraglacial lake volume from ASTER imagery	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Water stored in and released from supraglacial lakes is an important factor when considering the seasonal and long-term evolution of the Greenland ice sheet. Here we use a radiative transfer model to estimate changes in the depth and volume of a supraglacial lake on the surface of Jakobshavn Isbrae, West Greenland, between 2002 and 2005. When compared to estimates of the lake depth determined from airborne lidar observations, we estimate that the root-mean-square departure of the modelled lake depths was 0.3 m during cloud-free conditions. The maximum lake area, depth and volume were 3.4 km(2), 9.6 +/- 1.0 m and (18.6 +/- 3.7) x 10(6)m(3), respectively. When sequenced according to the number of positive degree-days (PDDs) accumulated prior to each image, we observe that the lake volume evolves in three distinct phases. At the start of the melting season, the rate of filling is slow; after approximately 80 PDDs the rate of filling increases by a factor similar to 3, and after approximately 125 PDDs the lake drains rapidly. We estimate that the lake drains at a minimum rate of (2.66 +/- 0.53) x 10(6) m(3)d(-1) over a 6 day period.

Temperature, pH, and water chemistry (major anions and cations) of the lakes were measured. Three archaeal clone libraries were constructed with a total of 297 sequences. Incorporating our previous data obtained from other lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, we performed statistical analyses to identify dominant environmental parameters that could account for the observed variations in archaeal community structure. We concluded that salinity and water chemistry (Na and bicarbonate concentration in particular) played an important role in shaping archaeal community. In particular, the relative abundance of archaeal 16S rRNA genes affiliated with the Halobacteriales of the Euryarchaeota increased with salinity, whereas that of crenarchaeotal 16S rRNA gene sequences showed the opposite trend. Crenarchaeotal 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from lake waters with salinity up to 28.3%. These results have important implications for our understanding of response of archaeal community to environmental changes in high-altitude lake ecosystems.

Trophic biology and migratory patterns of sympatric Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The trophic ecology (diet and head morphology) and migration patterns of two closely related salmonid fishes, Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus (L., 1758)) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma (Walbaum, 1792)), were examined in tributaries of Lake Aleknagik, southwestern Alaska, to test for differentiation between species. Schoener's index of proportional overlap and multivariate analyses of diets suggested that these species had significantly different trophic niches. Arctic char and the largest individuals of both species had the most diverse diets, and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum, 1792)) eggs dominated the diet of both species, especially Arctic char. Arctic char had larger jaws and wider heads than Dolly Varden of similar body length, which may contribute to interspecific diet difference. The species also differed in migration patterns; otolith microchemistry indicated that juvenile Arctic char were produced by nonanadromous mothers, whereas the mothers of the Dolly Varden had been to sea in the season prior to spawning. The species also segregate in spawning habitat (Arctic char in the lakes and Dolly Varden in streams), as well as in juvenile rearing habitat. Our study provides the first evidence of divergent feeding and migratory ecology between sympatric juvenile Arctic char and Dolly Varden, differences that may constrain hybridization and introgression between them.

Mapping the Tres Zapotes Polity The Effectiveness of Lidar in Tropical Alluvial Settings	ADVANCES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE												Seasonal wetlands and exuberant crop growth present challenges to systematic archaeological survey in alluvial settings, particularly in the tropical lowlands. Lidar can reduce the time and cost required to survey such areas by allowing targeting of elevated features not buried under recent alluvium, but demographic interpretation requires estimating post-abandonment alluvial depths. The broad alluvial plain between the Papaloapan delta and the Tuxtla Mountains in southern Veracruz, Mexico, offers a valuable case study, featuring seasonally inundated marshes, lakes, and vast fields of sugar cane, a crop infamously obstructive to lidar mapping. Undertaken to reconstruct demographic and organizational change in the Tres Zapotes polity, this study evaluates the benefits and limitations of lidar for archaeological survey in tropical alluvial settings based on overlap between lidar and systematic pedestrian survey and estimates of alluvial depth obtained by auger testing and underscores the importance of timing for lidar mapping in sugar cane.

Seasonal water-column dynamics of dissolved inorganic carbon stable isotopic compositions (δ13CDIC) in small hardwater lakes in Minnesota and Montana	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The carbon stable isotopic value of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)) was measured over several years at different depths in the water column in six carbonate-precipitating temperate lakes. delta C-13(DIC) behavior in three of these lakes departed from the conventional model wherein epilimnetic waters are seasonally enriched relative to all hypolimnetic waters, and in general delta C-13(DIC) values in the water column were not readily correlated to parameters such as lake stratification, algal productivity, hydraulic residence time, or water chemistry. Additionally, the processes implicated in generating the delta C-13(DIC) values of individual lakes differ between lakes with similar delta C-13(DIC) compositions. Each lake thus initially appears idiosyncratic, but when the effects of carbonate mineral equilibria, microbial activity, and lake residence time are viewed in terms of the magnitude of distinct DIC pools and fluxes in stratified lakes, generalizations call be made that allow lakes to be grouped by delta C-13(DIC) behavior. We recognize three modes in the relationship between delta C-13(DIC) values and DIC concentration ([DIC]) of individual lakes: (A) delta C-13(DIC) values decreasing with increasing [DIC]; (B) delta C-13(DIC) values increasing with increasing [DIC]; (C) delta C-13(DIC) values decreasing with increasing [DIC] but increasing again at the highest [DIC]. This approach is useful both in understanding delta C-13(DIC) dynamics in modern hardwater lakes and in reconstructing the environmental changes recorded by sedimentary delta C-13 components in the lacustrine pateorecord.

Holocene insolation and sea surface temperature influences on the polar front jet stream and precipitation in the midcontinental United States	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Variability in the source and seasonality of precipitation in the midcontinental United States during the Holocene was investigated using isotopic and sedimentological data from Martin Lake, northeastern Indiana, USA. Between 7100 and 4000 years before present (yr BP; present = 1950 CE), high S 18 O cal and S 13 C cal values with low variability indicate that moisture was predominantly derived from subtropical, southerly sources and delivered primarily during the warm season. Mean state shifts toward lower S 18 O cal and S 13 C cal occurred at ca. 4000 and 2550 yr BP, respectively, indicating an increase in northerly-sourced cold-season precipitation during the Late Holocene (i.e., the past 4200 years) and a subsequent reduction in warm season duration after 2550 yr BP. Record low %lithics from ca. 5000 to 4000 yr BP indicates major reductions in warm-season rain storms, consistent with regional evidence of drought at this time. An increase in the amplitude of centennial-scale variability in S 18 O cal , S 13 C cal , and %lithics after 1900 yr BP indicates greater precipitation source variability during the Common Era. During this interval, precipitation fluctuated between southerly-sourced, convective rainstorms when the Northern Hemisphere (NH) was warm (e.g., during the Medieval Climate Anomaly; 700-1000 - 1000 yr BP) and northerly-sourced rain and snow when the NH was cool (e.g., during the Little Ice Age; 150-550 - 550 yr BP). These trends, especially the change at ca. 4000 yr BP, are consistent with other North American paleoclimate records that collectively suggest a continental-scale shift in precipitation seasonality during the Middle to Late Holocene transition as the tropical Pacific Ocean transitioned from La Nina-like a-like conditions to a more El Nino-like o-like mean state. Concurrent NH cooling and persistent El Nino-like o-like conditions during the Late Holocene would have favored a southerly polar front jet stream with enhanced ridge and trough atmospheric circulation over North America - conditions resembling the positive mode of the Pacific-North American teleconnection (PNA). This would have increased interactions between high-latitude and subtropical airmasses over the midcontinent, increasing the proportion of northerly precipitation with low S 18 O delivered during the cold season (i.e., snowfall) and during extended periods with +PNA-like atmospheric circulation (e.g., the Little Ice Age).

To understand these communities, metabarcoding provides a powerful tool to assess their taxonomic composition and track spatio-temporal dynamics in both marine and freshwater environments. While marine ecosystems have been extensively studied, there is a notable research gap in understanding eukaryotic microbial communities in temperate lakes. Our study addresses this gap by investigating the free-living bacteria and small protist communities in Lake Ro & sacute; (Poland), a dimictic temperate lake. Metabarcoding analysis revealed that both the bacterial and protist communities exhibit distinct seasonal patterns that are not necessarily shaped by dominant taxa. Furthermore, machine learning and statistical methods identified crucial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) specific to each season. In addition, we identified a distinct community in the anoxic hypolimnion. We have also shown that the key factors shaping the composition of analysed community are temperature, oxygen, and silicon concentration. Understanding these community structures and the underlying factors is important in the context of climate change potentially impacting mixing patterns and leading to prolonged stratification. The study explored microbial diversity and seasonal dynamics in a temperate lake identifying different patterns in bacterial and protist communities, along with specific communities linked to deep anoxic layers.

Fishponds have a poor ecological state, requiring further insights for pond management. To gain those insights, monthly data on the pond environment were collected over the growing seasons from April to September (up to 14 years) across lowland to highland regions in Czechia. We used a ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphorus (DIN:TP) to investigate seasonal patterns of N and P limitations.ResultsFishponds in the lowland region (below 199 m above sea level, a.s.l.) were predominantly N-limited (80%), while ponds in the midland region (200-449 m a.s.l.) exhibited P limitation at the beginning of the growing season (April-May) and N limitation by the end of the season (August-September; 90% of fishponds). Highland fishponds (above 450 m a.s.l.) showed frequent P limitations, especially during the beginning of the season. Chlorophyll-a concentrations varied on both regional and seasonal scales, with the overall phytoplankton biomass peak at 31 ha of pond surface area. Chlorophyll-a remained stable at the beginning of the season regardless of the DIN:TP ratio but increased with a lower DIN:TP ratio by its end. The chlorophyll-a concentrations were lowest at the beginning and highest at the end of the season and decreased with altitude.ConclusionsSeasonal and regional variations in nutrient limitations and chlorophyll-a occur in fishponds. Our study suggests that targeted seasonal nutrient input and enhanced monitoring can significantly improve fishpond management practices and ecosystem stability.

Improving trophic niche and diet resolution of the salmonid community of Lake Ontario using three stable isotopes and multiple tissues	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Salmonids are ecologically and economically important fishes in Lake Ontario but declines in Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), recently the primary prey item, may cause shifts in salmonid diets. Improving our under-standing of salmonid trophic niches and diets and whether these have changed over time will provide insight into salmonid foraging patterns, ecology, and management. Using three stable isotopes (delta 13C, delta 15N and delta 34S) and Bayesian models, we estimated core trophic niches, niche overlaps among species, and diets for six salmonid species from Lake Ontario sampled during 2018. We used fin and muscle tissue with different temporal assim-ilation periods to assess seasonal variability in diet, and investigated salmonid trophic niches and diets among three major spatial units (East, Central, West). Overall, core trophic niches overlapped across all species, except Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Consistent with previous lake-wide analyses of Lake Ontario salmonid diets, Alewife were the preferred prey fish, although Lake Trout and Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) had more varied diets, particularly based on white muscle. Fin-based isotope mixing models predicted greater consumption of shallow (< 30 m depth) Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) for Lake Trout, Brown Trout (Salmo trutta), and Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) than other salmonids, indicating seasonal variation in diets. Lake Trout and Brown Trout also varied across spatial units with greater Round Goby consumption in western Lake Ontario. Spatially distinct diets suggest that Brown Trout and Lake Trout populations should be monitored regionally. Understanding prey consumption trends are important to effectively manage fish populations, especially considering on-going ecological changes in the Great Lakes.

J	Georgakakos, KP; Graham, NE				Georgakakos, Konstantine P.; Graham, Nicholas E.			Potential benefits of seasonal inflow prediction uncertainty for reservoir release decisions	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This paper examines the conditions for which beneficial use of forecast uncertainty may be made for improved reservoir release decisions. It highlights the parametric dependencies of the effects of uncertainty in seasonal inflow volumes on the optimal release and objective function of a single reservoir operated to meet a single volume target at the end of the season under volume and release constraints. The duration of the "season" may be one or several months long. The analysis invokes the application of Kuhn-Tucker theory, and it shows that the presence of uncertainty introduces complex dependence of the optimal release and objective function on the reservoir parameters and uncertain inflow forcing. The seasonal inflow volume uncertainty is represented by a bounded symmetric beta distribution with a given mean, which is considered to be unbiased, and a half-range Q(R). The authors find that the use of predicted inflow uncertainty is particularly beneficial during operation with a volume target that is either near reservoir capacity or near zero reservoir volume, with the optimal release being directly dependent on QR in these situations. This positive finding is moderated by the additional finding that errors in the estimation of predicted QR can result in significant operation losses (larger deviations from the target volume) that are due to suboptimal release decisions. Furthermore, the presence of binding release constraints leads to loss of optimal release and objective function benefits due to the seasonal inflow uncertainty predictions, suggesting less rigid release policies for improved operations under uncertain forecasts. It is also shown that the reservoir capacity values for which optimal reservoir operations are most sensitive to seasonal inflow uncertainty predictions are found to be at most 5 times the uncertainty range of the predicted seasonal inflow volume and to be at least as large as the uncertainty range of predicted inflow volumes. Suggestions for continued research in this area are offered.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				MAY	2008	47	5					1297	1321		10.1175/2007JAMC1671.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2007JAMC1671.1													WOS:000256574500003

Possible reasons and consequences of allometric growth and reproduction in adult signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus (Dana, 1852)) are among the most invasive macroinvertebrates in Europe, representing economic value as well as serious threats to ecosystems. Despite decades of research, uncertainties with respect to its biology remain. The present study describes the observations of adult signal crayfish during a single growing season, with a sex ratio of 1:1, reared under natural ambient conditions, in which moulting events, growth increments, morphological changes, mortality, and reproductive output were monitored. Two moults were observed in the majority of both sexes, with significant differences in moult growth increments of once- and twice-moulted animals. These led to modifications in morphology during the growing season. Females showed isometric growth at the first moult, while, at the second moult, they strengthened the functional state of structures linked to reproduction. In males, the effect was similar, but to a lesser extent, with extensive chelae development at the second moult. There were no differences in relative fecundity of once- and twice-moulted females. However, signal crayfish have different needs during the growing and reproductive seasons. The presented results indicate the ability to use resources according to current needs (development of strategical body parts) via their seasonal morphological plasticity as seen in representatives of the family Cambaridae.

An altimeter processing technique is developed for the detection, including waveform retracking, quality data selection, and elevation adjustment. The altimeter-observed glacier thinning is confirmed by the direct elevation differences between the digital elevation models from the satellite missions TanDEM-X and SRTM, and by the glacier area losses from Landsat images. At the two glacier sites, the altimeter-derived elevations show seasonal oscillations, with mean rates of -3.71 +/- 0.3 and -3.08 +/- 0.20 m year(-1) over 1993-2002 (T/P only), and -1.88 +/- 0.06 and -1.46 +/- 0.07 m year(-1) over 1993-2020 (T/P-Jason altimeters), with abnormal changes around the 1997-1998 El Nino. The declining rates suggest that the persistent losses of glaciers in Tanggula Mountains can no longer sustain the large thinning rates. The glacier feeds the nearby Chibuzhang Co lake, and lake level and glacier level changes from Cryosat-2 are consistent with those from the T/P-Jason altimeters. The glacier meltwater contributed to the accelerated rise of the glacier-fed Chibuzhang Co, at a rate of 0.15 +/- 0.05 m year(-1) over 1993-2002, increasing to 0.42 +/- 0.01 m year(-1) over 2003-2020. The lake levels of Chibuzhang Co experienced notable drops after the 1997-1998 and 2014-2016 El Nino. The Cryosat-2 result shows the altitude effect of glacier change: the higher the glacier, the less it melts. A repeat altimeter can provide time-lapsed elevation measurements as a virtual glacier station to monitor glacier melt caused by climate change.					; Lee, Jui-Chi/ABG-8244-2021; Andersen, Ole Baltazar/H-7481-2016; Tseng, Kuo-Hsin/NDT-1118-2025; Andersen, Ole/H-7481-2016	Abulaitijiang, Adili/0009-0001-2435-6218; Andersen, Ole Baltazar/0000-0002-6685-3415; Tseng, Kuo-Hsin/0000-0003-3581-076X; Lee, Jui-Chi/0000-0001-6686-546X													1017-0839	2311-7680				FEB	2021	32	1					1	20		10.3319/TAO.2020.11.15.01	http://dx.doi.org/10.3319/TAO.2020.11.15.01													WOS:000647821000001

Using 7 years of eddy covariance flux observations in the Ebinur Lake National Wetland Nature Reserve (ELNWNR) in Xinjiang, Northwest China, this study analyzes the surface-atmosphere energy transfer characteristics at the station to explore variation characteristics of the energy flux and the energy balance closure (EBC), and the factors that influence EBC. The results show that: (1) diurnal and seasonal variations are observed in turbulent flux, available energy, and the partitioning of sensible and latent fluxes affected by environmental factors; (2) the degree of EBC varies significantly diurnally and seasonally, with EBC during the growing season significantly higher than during the dormant season; (3) due to the surface heterogeneity, EBC exhibits significant variations with wind direction that differ between the growing and dormant seasons; (4) environmental factors (e.g., vapor pressure deficit and air temperature) are important in limiting near-surface EBC, but they play a secondary role compared with the state of atmospheric motion.

Lake Lucero is a highly dynamic environment, strongly characterized by the capillary action of the groundwater, the extreme seasonality of the climate, and the hypersalinity. Sediments are predominantly composed of gypsum with minor quartz, thenardite, halite, quartz, epsomite, celestine, and clays. Geochemical analysis has revealed the predominance of nitrates over ammonium in all of the analyzed samples, indicating oxygenated conditions throughout the sediment column and in groundwater. Conversely, the microbial communities are primarily aerobic, gram-negative, and are largely characterized by their survival adaptations. Halophiles and oligotrophs are ubiquitous for all the samples. The very diverse communities contain methanogens, phototrophs, heterotrophs, saprophytes, ammonia-oxidizers, sulfur-oxidizers, sulfate-reducers, iron-reducers, and nitrifiers. The microbial diversity varied significantly between groundwater and sediment samples as their temperature adaptation inferences that revealed potential psychrophiles inhabiting the groundwater and thermophiles and mesophiles being present in the sediment. The dynamism of this environment manifests in the relatively even character of the sediment hosted microbial communities, where significant taxonomic distinctions were observed. Therefore, sediment and groundwater substrates are considered as separate ecological entities. We hope that the variety of the discussed playa environments and the microorganisms may be considered a useful terrestrial analog providing valuable information to aid future astrobiological explorations.					; Glamoclija, Mihaela/GWQ-3360-2022; Sirisena, Kosala/AAR-2022-2020	Glamoclija, Mihaela/0000-0003-4327-6480; 													1664-302X					NOV 12	2019	10								2595	10.3389/fmicb.2019.02595	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02595								31781077					WOS:000499212800001

As model systems, ponds are a good object for ecological research and monitoring of global environmental changes. We examined cyanobacteria along with other groups of algae versus zooplankton and abiotic characteristics of water in 51 aquatic ecosystems exposed to anthropogenic pressure (from natural forest to highly disturbed field ponds) with 3 distinct trophic groups: meso-, eu- and hypertrophic. This study aimed to define how different levels of trophy affect pond-specific cyanobacteria assemblages and to identify species responding to particular trophic states. We demonstrated that trophic type determined the occurrence of certain cyanobacteria species. From among 78 identified taxa, shade- and turbid mixed adapted were the most numerous. Eutrophic ponds had the highest cyanobacteria species and diversity and abundance of zooplankon. Dominating species such as Chroococcus minimus, , Anagnostidinema amphibium, , Phormidium granulatum or Komvophoron minutum preferred mesotrophic, while e.g. Jaaginema subtilissimum, , Limnolyngbya circumcreta, , Limnothrix vacuolifera or Romeria leopolienis eutrophic waters and these were not grazed by filtrators. Only 3 species ( Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, , Dolichospermum circinale, , Planktothrix agardhii) ) were associated with hypertrophic ponds. Therefore, we assume that cyanobacteria taxa have a high indicative potential to distinguish between trophic type of ponds. Reynolds Functional Groups also exhibit responses to changes in water quality. It was partucularly evident in the case of cyanobacteria representatives of codon M which was attributed to eutrophic ponds. Advancing our understanding about trophic preferences of cyanobacteria is crucial, especially in the era of global warming and the persistent issue of water eutrophication, when problems with harmful cyanobacterial					Kuczyńska-Kippen, Natalia/AAC-1955-2022; Celewicz, Sofia/Q-9399-2018	Celewicz, Sofia/0000-0003-2033-2777; Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia/0000-0002-0513-9461													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 1	2024	949								174932	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174932		AUG 2024						39074746					WOS:001287747100001

In this study, we used the oxygen isotope of phosphate (S18Op) 18 O p ) as a tracer in the river-lake systems, establishing a tracing pathway from potential end-members, through inflow rivers, and eventually to the lake. Taking Dianshan Lake and its main inflow rivers as the study area, we measured S 18 O p values of potential end-members, including domestic sewage treatment plant effluents, industrial effluents from phosphorus-related enterprises (printing and dyeing, electroplating, plastics, etc.), and farmland soils. Notably, the industrial effluent signatures ranged from 13.1 %o to 21.0 %o with an average of 16.8 %o +/- 3.2 %o, enriching the S 18 O p threshold database. Using the MixSIAR model, it was found that phosphorus in the Jishuigang River primarily originated from agricultural non-point sources and domestic sewage in the dry season, while the Qiandengpu River, with a higher proportion of urban area, had a greater influence from domestic sewage and industrial effluents. Moreover, significant differences were observed between S 18 O p values at the lake entrances of the inflow rivers (13.7 %o +/- 1.0 %o) and in acid-soluble phosphate of the lake sediments (9.9 %o +/- 1.0 %o). Isotopic tracing revealed that phosphorus in the lake originated from both external inputs (80.6 %) and internal release (19.4 %) in the dry season. Alongside pollutant flux calculations based on the hydrological conditions and water quality of the inflow rivers, our findings indicated that phosphorus in Dianshan Lake was mainly attributed to agricultural non-point sources, domestic sewage and sediment release in the dry season. This study provided novel insights into the identification of pollution sources in the river-lake systems, with broad implications for pollution control and environmental protection.

The seasonal variation and ecological risk of microplastics in the Lower Ganges River, Bangladesh	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Microplastic (MP) pollution has gained considerable attention in various ecosystems; however, it has received relatively less attention in freshwater-riverine environments than in other ecosystems. The Ganges River Delta, one of the world's most densely populated areas, is a potential source of MP pollution in the freshwater ecosystem. MPs were identified throughout the year in the lower Ganges River water. Seasonally, the highest abundance was observed during the monsoon (14.66 +/- 2.06 MPs/L), followed by the pre-monsoon (13.46 +/- 1.75 MPs/L) and post-monsoon (11.50 +/- 0.40 MPs/L). Throughout the year, MP discharge was estimated at 4.12 x 1012 to 2.17 x 1013 MPs/year. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy identified plastic polymers in the water, like ethylene vinyl acetate, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, and nylon. Moderate contamination by MPs was assessed throughout the year. Significant correlations between MP abundance and both rainfall and discharge were observed. It is essential to implement preventative measures in the Ganges River Basin to mitigate MP pollution before the situation worsens.Practitioner Points Throughout the year, MP concentration ranged from 10.67 to 20.33 MPs/L The highest MP occurrence was observed in the monsoon season (14.66 +/- 2.06 MPs/L) The lowest abundance was detected in the post-monsoon period (11.50 +/- 0.40 MPs/L) There was a moderate level of MP contamination in the lower Ganges River water It was shown that discharge and rainfall were correlated with MP abundance Microplastic (MP) pollution was observed throughout the year in the lower Ganges River water, with the highest and lowest abundance recorded during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. The study revealed a correlation between MP abundance and discharge and rainfall in the river water. image					Tareq, Shafi/AAH-9973-2020; fahmida, parvin/AAF-9675-2021; Shammi, Mashura/AAA-3372-2020	Tareq, Sayeed Ahamed/0009-0002-0249-4166; Hassan, Md.

Process-based models (PBMs) are typically used to simulate water quality modeling. In watershed modeling utilizing PBMs, it is crucial to effectively reflect the actual watershed conditions by appropriately setting the model parameters. However, parameter calibration and validation are time-consuming processes with inherent uncertainties. Addressing these challenges, this research aims to address various challenges encountered in the calibration and validation processes of PBMs. To achieve this, the development of a hybrid model, combining uncalibrated PBMs with data-driven models (DDMs) such as deep learning algorithms is proposed. This hybrid model is intended to enhance watershed modeling by integrating the strengths of both PBMs and DDMs. The hybrid model is constructed by coupling an uncalibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). SWAT, a representative PBM, is constructed using geographical information and 5-year observed data from the Yeongsan River Watershed. The output variables of the uncalibrated SWAT, such as streamflow, suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), as well as observed precipitation for the day and previous day, are used as training data for the deep learning model to predict the TP load. For the comparison, the conventional SWAT model is calibrated and validated to predict the TP load. The results revealed that TP load simulated by the hybrid model predicted the observed TP better than that predicted by the calibrated SWAT model. Also, the hybrid model reflects seasonal variations in the TP load, including peak events. Remarkably, when applied to other sub-basins without specific training, the hybrid model consistently outperformed the calibrated SWAT model. In conclusion, application of the SWAT-LSTM hybrid model could be a useful tool for decreasing uncertainties in model calibration and improving the overall predictive performance in watershed modeling.Practitioner points We aimed to enhance process-based models for watershed water-quality modeling. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Long Short-Term Memory hybrid model's predicted and total phosphorus (TP) matched the observed TP. It exhibited superior predictive performance when applied to other sub-basins. The hybrid model will overcome the constraints of conventional modeling. It will also enable more effective and efficient modeling. A hybrid model that combined process-based and deep learning models was constructed to advance the intricate parameter calibration and validation inherent in the process-based model. A hybrid model outperformed the conventional SWAT model, providing superior predictive performance and more convenient modeling capabilities. image					Kim, Joon/AAS-1429-2020; Kim, Jin Hwi/MHQ-7811-2025	Jeong, Dae Seong/0009-0004-8684-4737													1061-4303	1554-7531				AUG	2024	96	8							e11079	10.1002/wer.11079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wer.11079								39096183					WOS:001282792800001
J	Hoehle, M; Wrozyna, C				Hoehle, Marlene; Wrozyna, Claudia			Spatio-temporal distribution of ostracod species in saline inland lakes (Mansfeld lake area; Central Germany)	PEERJ												Ostracods are a diverse group of microcrustaceans with a ubiquitous distribution in a wide array of aquatic habitats and are common constituents of lake sediments. Inferences on the temporal-spatial distribution of ostracod species is a prerequisite for reconstructions of palaeoenvironmental conditions. This requires a precise knowl-edge not only about ecological preferences and specific life histories, but also the understanding how (local) ecological parameters affect ostracod species assemblages (abundance and composition). Generally, these studies are rare and often characterized by an insufficient differentiation of living specimens from the total amount of valves of the modern population leading to uncertainties in species occurrences and diversity data. Modern ostracod populations were sampled from 12 water bodies within a relatively small study area (Mansfeld lake area, Central Germany). Physico-chemical parameters (temperature, oxygen content, conductivity, pH) were measured in situ and the uppermost 2 cm of sediment were collected in different seasons (April, June, September). Relative abundances of ostracods (living and dead), differentiated for adults and juveniles, were used for statistical analyses (Spearman's rank correlation, Canonical correspondence analysis, Cluster analyses, Fisher's alpha), to investigate rela-tionships between species distribution and environmental factors as well as to identify habitat similarities and ostracod species assemblages. In total, 27 ostracod species (20 living species) were identified. Majority of them are considered as very common (cosmopolitan) freshwater species. Only two species are usually known from brackish water (Cytheromorpha fuscata and Cyprideis torosa). This is the first confirmation of living C. torosa in German inland waters. The relative abundances of ostracods show strong fluctuations during the study period and differences in composition of the ostracod species assemblages between and within the water bodies. There are also strong differences between bio-and taphocoenoses. The measured physico-chemical parameters which are usually considered as most important drivers on ostracod species distribution do not contribute to explain the observed temporal-spatial distribution of the ostracod species. Differences in taphocoenoses show, that taphonomic processes can be very local and the sampling site, as well as the sampling time, is crucial. Biodiversity of ostracods is biased by sampling time, the variability of the ostracod assemblages between sampling month and the relationship between abundance of valves and living ostracods is not straightforward. Therefore, without precise knowledge of the ecological requirements of a species at a local scale, uncertainties may exist for the palaeoecological indication of a species.

Seasonal dynamics of phenolic substances from the macrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum and their allelopathic effects on the growth and reproduction of Plationus patulus (Rotifera: Brachionidae)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied temporal variations in phenolic compounds from the hydrophyte Myriophyllum aquaticum collected from a shallow lake. The effects of macrophyte-conditioned medium containing phenols with other compounds and phenols only as well as plant tissue extracts were tested on the survival and reproduction of the rotifer Plationus patulus. Apical tissue of the hydrophyte had the highest levels of total phenols. Rotifers in controls, and those exposed to phenols from the macrophyte-conditioned medium grew rapidly within two weeks, but cultures exposed to phenols extracted from the apical region took longer. Age-specific survival of P. patulus showed a rapid decline within one week when exposed to plant extracts compared to conditioned medium. The average lifespan of P. patulus was longer in the macrophyte-conditioned medium as compared to the controls, but shorter in the aqueous plant extract. Gross and net reproductive rates showed similar trends, wherein the controls had significantly higher values than those exposed to plant extracts, but increased with the conditioned medium only at the two lower concentrations tested. The demographic response of rotifers exposed to phenols only from the macrophyte-conditioned medium differed from those of the macrophyte-conditioned medium containing both phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. Macrophyte phenolic compounds influenced the survival and reproduction of P. patulus but depended on the other chemicals released into the medium.					; Nandini, S./AFN-8031-2022; Sarma, S.S.S./G-3634-2010	Sarma, S.S.S./0000-0003-2820-1579; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2022	849	17-18			SI		3843	3858		10.1007/s10750-022-04963-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-04963-0		AUG 2022											WOS:000837919300004

Histologic, immunologic and endocrine biomarkers indicate contaminant effects in fishes of the Ashtabula River	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The use of fish as sentinels of aquatic ecosystem health is a biologically relevant approach to environmental monitoring and assessment. We examined the health of the Ashtabula River using histologic, immunologic, and endocrine biomarkers in brown bullhead (BB; Ameiurus nebulosus) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and compared fish collected from a reference site (Conneaut Creek). Seasonal analysis was necessary to distinguish differences in fish between the two rivers. Overall BB from the Ashtabula River had a lower condition factor and significantly more macrophage aggregates than those from the reference site. Reduced bactericidal and cytotoxic-cell activity was observed in anterior kidney leukocytes from both BB and largemouth bass from the Ashtabula River. Lower plasma thyroxine and triiodo-l-thyronine in both species in the Ashtabula River indicated disruption of the thyroid axis. Differences in physiological biomarker responses were supported by body burden chemical concentrations when data were analyzed on a seasonal basis. The use of two fish species added a level of rigor that demonstrated biological effects were not exclusive to a single species. The results provide strong evidence that contaminants have affected fish in the Ashtabula River, a Great Lakes Area of Concern, and provide a baseline by which to evaluate remediation activities.					; Hitt, Nathaniel/Y-6541-2019; Iwanowicz, Luke/AAB-3247-2021	Ottinger, Christopher/0000-0003-2551-1985; Iwanowicz, Luke/0000-0002-1197-6178; 													0963-9292	1573-3017				JAN	2012	21	1					165	182		10.1007/s10646-011-0776-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-011-0776-0								21882039					WOS:000298996900018
J	Grey, J				Grey, Jonathan			The use of stable isotope analyses in freshwater ecology: Current awareness	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY					4th Symposium for European Freshwater Science (SEFS 4)	AUG, 2005	Jagiellonian Univ, Cracow, POLAND		Jagiellonian Univ			Ecological research using stable isotopes has progressed rapidly during the last 20 years and although more studies are including the addition of isotopically labelled compounds at tracer levels, the overwhelming majority rely on measurements of natural abundance ratios. Access to isotope ratio mass spectrometry has increased, spurred on by awareness of the techniques and increasing demand, and consequently cost of sample analysis has dropped. Today stable isotopes of carbon (C-13/C-12), nitrogen (N-15/N-14), sulphur (S-34/S-32), oxygen (O-18/O-16), and hydrogen (H-2/H-1) can be determined routinely. Perhaps one of the most appealing attributes of isotopic signatures is their potential use to find patterns and determine mechanisms across a range of scales from the molecular level through to characterising whole food webs, reconstructing palaeoenvironments, tracing nutrient fluxes between ecosystems and identifying subsidies, or migrations of organisms. Ecologists from every discipline who are unlikely to have been trained as isotope chemists have added stable isotope analysis (SIA) to their "toolbox", but often increasing use leads to increasing abuse. The usefulness of SIA arises from predictable physical and enzymatic-based discrimination between biological and non-biological materials leading to different isotopic compositions. Without some ecological understanding of these, interpretation of isotope-derived data can often be flawed. Here, I explore how SIA recently has been used for research in aquatic ecology, reviewing how some of these techniques have allowed elucidation of key processes in aquatic systems such as the contribution of allochthony to lake food webs, and discuss the "state of the art". Included are some thoughts on where our knowledge in aquatic ecology remains deficient and how continued development and future application of SIA and interdisciplinary methodologies may be applied.					; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; 													1505-2249						2006	54	4					563	584																WOS:000243236300004

A multiproxy study, based on sedimentological descriptions, together with mineralogy, carbonate content, XRF core scanning and biological proxies supported by AMS C-14 dates, were applied to the 3-m-long core extracted from "Flowers Marsh", a small Middle Atlas pond. This approach provides evidence for a continuous paleohydrological and paleoenvironmental record during the Mid- to Late Holocene. The investigated aquatic system evolved from a dry or very shallow waterbody towards a system with a progressively rising water level. The dominance of the detrital fraction with poor preservation of bioindicators and eroded pollen, indicate the existence of an ephemeral waterbody from 6000 cal. yr BP until a transitional phase characterized by new sedimentological facies and the appearance of ostracods around 2300 cal. yr BP. This transition, ending at 2000 cal. yr BP, is interpreted as a flooding phase leading to an ephemeral lake. It is certainly fed by the excess water from the nearby Aguelmam Azigza Lake during its high level period. Afterwards, enhanced organic matter deposition and the appearance of well-preserved diatoms until 1400 cal. yr BP corroborate a high water-level trend. Endogenic carbonate to detrital fraction ratios indicate fluctuating, but generally shallow, water levels from 1400 cal. yr BP until 650 cal. yr BP when a relatively rapid rise in water level occurred. Flowers Marsh data are, generally, consistent with most of the existing regional records. The highstand period recorded between 2000 and 1400 cal. yr is a common feature extending to more distant sites from the northern Mediterranean. It corresponds to the wetter Iberian-Roman period. Fluctuating shallow water levels recorded since 1400 cal. yr BP to now could be linked to drier/wetter phases associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age (650- 150 cal. yr BP) respectively, in the western Mediterranean realm. The present study demonstrates the ability of Flowers Marsh to record valuable palaeohydrological changes since the Mid-Holocene and confirms the high sensitivity of Middle Atlas hydrosystems to climatic changes.

But, usually, collecting in situ data is restricted in these areas because of their remote locations, vast area and dynamic conditions. Remote sensing provides a cost effective tool to investigate hydrological patterns and the seasonal trend of changes in wetlands. In this paper, Land-use/land-cover change during water inundation period of Hamun wetland was investigated in order to determine change trend during this period. Hamun wetland is an unsustainable ecosystem, and monitoring this wetland is essential for conservation goals. This trend is critical for decision makers in order to plan the conservational scheme in all unsustainable ecosystems. To reach this objective, the land-use/land-cover maps during inundation period of Hamun were produced using Landsat 8 time series images. The results of accuracy assessment showed the classification of water and vegetation have the highest accuracy (94% and 93%, respectively). And the accuracy of plants in the water classes was the lowest (water-veg=89.9%, veg-water 1=88.8%, veg-water 2=87.6%). This means the higher misclassification is in determining the vegetation in the water. Then, the changes in the land-cover classes in relation to wetland inundation were investigated. Results of land-use/land-cover change illustrate the regions that were suitable for water birds but lost their suitability when the wetland dried out. These areas are crucial for water bird's conservation. Satellite data determined these areas with acceptable accuracy.					; Pourmanafi, Saeid/AAX-7957-2021; Saatchi, Sassan/AAQ-2649-2021	Maleki, Saeideh/0000-0002-7005-5029; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				NOV	2018	46	11					1871	1879		10.1007/s12524-018-0842-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-018-0842-7													WOS:000451342600013

The first spinicaudatan (Crustacea:Diplostraca) from Permo-Triassic continental sequences in South America and its palaeoecological context. Alcheringa 37, 187-199. ISSN 0311-5518. Cornia martinsnetoi sp. nov., the first spinicaudatan from Permian-Triassic continental sequences of southern South America, is described. The new species has characters diagnostic of the typical late Palaeozoic-Early Triassic subfamily Vertexiinae from Gondwana. This new taxon was found in tuffaceous siltstones in the upper part of the Quebrada de los Fosiles Formation (Puesto Viejo Group), which may span the Permo-Triassic boundary in Argentina. The lower and coarser-grained interval of the Quebrada de los Fosiles Formation was deposited in distal alluvial fans and low- to high-sinuosity rivers. The upper fine-grained interval of this formation, which hosts the spinicaudatans and associated fossils (ostracods, megaspores, fish scales), was deposited in shallow floodplain lakes.

Starvation causes disturbance in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism in Diporeia	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												The benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. was once the predominant macroinvertebrate in deep, offshore regions of the Laurentian Great Lakes. However, since the early 1990s, Diporeia populations have steadily declined across the area. It has been hypothesized that this decline is due to starvation from increasing competition for food with invasive dreissenid mussels. In order to gain a better understanding of the changes in Diporeia physiology during starvation, we applied two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry (GCXGC/TOF-MS) for investigating the responses in Diporeia metabolome during starvation. We starved Diporeia for 60 days and collected five organisms every 12 days for metabolome analyses. Upon arrival to the laboratory, organisms were flash frozen and served as control (day 0). We observed an increase in lipid oxidation and protein catabolism with subsequent declines of essential amino acids (proline, glutamine, and phenylalanine), down-regulation of glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, and decreased polyunsaturated fatty acid abundance in nutritionally stressed Diporeia. Abundance of 1-lodo-2-methylundecane, a metabolite closely related to insect pheromones, also declined with starvation. This research has further substantiated the applicability of GCXGC/TOF-MS as a research tool in the field of environmental metabolomics. The next step is to apply this new knowledge for evaluating nutritional status of feral Diporeia to elucidate the underlying cause(s) responsible for their decline in the Great Lakes.

The moraine-dammed glacial lakes were studied for three seasons to create baseline data. The second, third, and fourth lakes in the Gokyo Valley are deeper than previously assumed. The vertical profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen indicated that the thermocline zone varied between 10 and 20 m below the surface during the post-monsoon season. Although most of the analyzed metal concentrations were below the level recommended by the WHO for safe drinking water, lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) levels exceeded the limits in some of the samples. This has created great concern for human health. The probable route of these two pollutants is monsoon precipitation that carries industrial pollutants along its route. The sedimentation rates of Gokyo Lakes range from 0.069 to 0.089 cm per annum, which is within the limits of other high-altitude lakes. The present findings created a baseline database for some of the remote high-altitude lakes in Nepal that can be used for lake management and for assessing future changes in lake characteristics in the Himalayan region.

We used Landsat 4-8 imagery from 1984 through 2021 to manually map lower glacier ice margins for 19 maritime glaciers in Kenai Fjords National Park. Of these glaciers, six are tidewater, three are lake-terminating, six are land-terminating and four terminated in more than one environment throughout the study period. We used the mapped ice margins to quantify seasonal terminus position and areal change, including distinguishing between ice loss at glacier termini and along glacier margins. Overall, 13 glaciers substantially retreated (more than 2 sigma), 14 lost substantial area and only two underwent both net advance and area gain. The glaciers that had insubstantial length and area changes were predominantly tidewater. Cumulatively, the lower reaches of these 19 glaciers lost 42 km(2) of ice, which was nearly evenly distributed between the terminus and the lateral margins. The rapid rate of glacier change and subsequent land cover changes are highly visible to visitors and locals at Kenai Fjords National Park, and this study quantifies those changes in terms of glacier length and area.

Plastic response to a proxy cue of predation risk when direct cues are unreliable	ECOLOGY												Responses to proximate cues that directly affect fitness or cues directly released by selective agents are well-documented forms of phenotypic plasticity. For example, to reduce predation risk, prey change phenotype in response to light level (e.g., moon phase) when light affects predation risk from visual predators, and to chemical cues (kairomones) released by predators. Less well understood is the potential for organisms to perceive predation risk through proxy cues: proximate cues that correlate with, but do not directly affect predation risk. Previous field studies indicate that body and spine length of an invasive cladoceran in Lake Michigan, Bythotrephes longimanus (the spiny water flea), increase during the growing season, coincident with a decrease in clutch size. Although the cause of seasonal trait changes is not known, changes are associated with warmer water temperature and increased predation risk from gape-limited fish (i.e., fish whose ability to consume Bythotrephes is limited by mouth size). Using a laboratory experiment, we found no effect of fish (Perca flavescens) kairomones on Bythotrephes morphology or life history. In contrast, higher water temperature led to longer absolute spine and body length, increased investment in morphological defense of offspring (measured as the ratio of spine-to-body length), and decreased clutch size and age at reproduction. These plastic responses are unlikely to be adaptive to temperature per se, but rather our findings indicate that temperature serves as a proxy cue of fish predation risk. Temperature correlates with risk of gape-limited fish predation due to growth of fish from larval stages incapable of consuming Bythotrephes early in the season, to larger sizes by midseason increasingly capable of consuming Bythotrephes, but limited by gape size to consuming smaller individuals. We argue that for Bythotrephes, temperature is a more reliable cue of predation risk than fish kairomones, because fish kairomones are present throughout the season due to continual presence of non-gape-limited adult fish, to which plastic response would have little effect. Organisms may, therefore, not only respond to changes in an environmental factor because the factor directly affects risk, but also when the environmental factor serves as a proxy signaling change in predation risk.					; Bourdeau, Paul/AAA-3551-2019; McAdam, Andrew/G-1802-2010	Miehls, Andrea/0000-0002-9556-1817; McAdam, Andrew/0000-0001-7323-2572													0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	2013	94	10					2237	2248		10.1890/12-2250.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-2250.1								24358710					WOS:000325692900016

Long-term nitrate and phosphate loading of river water in the Upper Manyame Catchment, Zimbabwe	WATER SA												Urbanisation and agriculture represent a dramatic example of human interference in catchment hydrology. The impact of agricultural, domestic, industrial and municipal activities on river flow and water quality within the Upper Manyame Catchment Area (UMCA) was assessed using 7-year nitrate, phosphate and water flow rate data, collected by the Environmental Management Agency (EMA). Water samples for nitrate and phosphate analysis were collected at 8 points along the Manyame (2 points), Marimba (2 points) and Mukuvisi (4 points) rivers, and runoff volume was recorded at the mouth of each river. Annual runoff of each river was closely related to rainfall amount, with the lowest runoff being recorded during drought years. High nitrate and phosphate concentrations were recorded directly downstream of residential, municipal and industrial areas suggesting that these were the major sources of the pollutants found in the river water. For example, phosphate concentration at 2 sites along Mukuvisi River (downstream of domestic and industrial areas) exceeded the statutory limit (0.5 mg/l) for `safe' or good quality water (`blue' category) according to the Zimbabwe Water (Waste and Effluent Disposal) Regulations, and ranged from 0.78 mg/l during the dry season to 2.23 mg/l during the wet season. In the Marimba River phosphate concentration at Site 4 (downstream of domestic, industrial and sewage processing plant) also exceeded the safe water quality standard by 4-6 times. Although Marimba River contributes the lowest proportion of runoff (relative to the other two rivers sampled) entering Lake Chivero, it contributed the highest nitrate (114 840 kg/yr) and phosphate (84 324 kg/yr) loading. It was concluded that anthropogenic activities within the UMCA were the major sources of nitrate and phosphate pollution in the three rivers and pose a serious threat to the ecological sustainability of the rivers and lakes downstream, and to the economic wellbeing of nearby cities which rely on the water for potable uses.

J	Schwarzenberger, A; Sadler, T; Von Elert, E				Schwarzenberger, Anke; Sadler, Thomas; Von Elert, Eric			Effect of nutrient limitation of cyanobacteria on protease inhibitor production and fitness of Daphnia magna	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Herbivore-plant interactions have been well studied in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as they are crucial for the trophic transfer of energy and matter. In nutrient-rich freshwater ecosystems, the interaction between primary producers and herbivores is to a large extent represented by Daphnia and cyanobacteria. The occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and ponds has, at least partly, been attributed to cyanotoxins, which negatively affect the major grazer of planktonic cyanobacteria, i.e. Daphnia. Among these cyanotoxins are the widespread protease inhibitors. These inhibitors have been shown (both in vitro and in situ) to inhibit the most important group of digestive proteases in the gut of Daphnia, i.e. trypsins and chymotrypsins, and to reduce Daphnia growth. In this study we grew cultures of the cyanobacterium Microcystis sp. strain BM25 on nutrient-replete, N-depleted or P-depleted medium. We identified three different micropeptins to be the cause for the inhibitory activity of BM25 against chymotrypsins. The micropeptin content depended on nutrient availability: whereas N limitation led to a lower concentration of micropeptins per biomass, P limitation resulted in a higher production of these chymotrypsin inhibitors. The altered micropeptin content of BM25 was accompanied by changed effects on the fitness of Daphnia magna: a higher content of micropeptins led to lower IC50 values for D. magna gut proteases and vice versa. Following expectations, the lower micropeptin content in the N-depleted BM25 caused higher somatic growth of D. magna. Therefore, protease inhibitors can be regarded as a nutrient-dependent defence against grazers. Interestingly, although the P limitation of the cyanobacterium led to a higher micropeptin content, high growth of D. magna was observed when they were fed with P-depleted BM25. This might be due to reduced digestibility of P-depleted cells with putatively thick mucilaginous sheaths. These findings indicate that both the grazer and the cyanobacterium benefit from P reduction in terms of digestibility and growth inhibition, which is an interesting starting point for further studies.					von Elert, Eric/S-1666-2018	von Elert, Eric/0000-0001-7758-716X; Schwarzenberger, Anke/0000-0002-5877-8726; Sadler, Thomas/0000-0002-8621-379X													0022-0949	1477-9145				OCT	2013	216	19					3649	3655		10.1242/jeb.088849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.088849								23788705					WOS:000324233500018

Estimating the stocking potential of fish in impoundments by modelling supply and steady-state demand	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Fish stocking is an increasingly common management tool for freshwater and marine environments and is often used to create and maintain fisheries in closed waters. The densities at which fish are stocked can have a large impact on a stocking programmes success and sustainability. Stocking densities in impoundment sport-fisheries, for example, are often based on social or practical factors, and ecologically based stocking models are needed to assist the selection of stocking densities that are appropriate for the environment. 2. In this study, stocking density is calculated with a numerical model that balances the supply of prey production with the energetic demand of stocked fish. The model aims to deliver outcomes over a range of potential management objectives, by providing specific consumption scenarios that represent the trade-off between population abundance and individual body size in stocked fisheries. 3. The model uses a steady-state population approach to calculate stocking density, which optimises population consumption by maintaining a consistent biomass distribution and encourages sustainable stocking by considering the energetic needs of all cohorts. Carrying capacity is represented by the steady-state stocking density under a minimum consumption scenario (when fish meet only their minimum energetic needs). The comparison between a desired consumption rate and the existing level of production is used to assess the status or health of the existing population and is used to determine whether stocking can occur and whether stocking densities can be sustainably increased. The probability of incorrectly assuming populations are achieving a given consumption level is also estimated, which is an ideal approach for interpreting multiple probability distributions. 4. A Monte-Carlo analysis of uncertainty was used to provide a probability distribution of stocking density of Australian bass (Macquaria novemaculeata) in three Australian impoundments under various seasonal and consumption scenarios. The likely consumption rates of the existing populations were determined using historical stocking densities, which showed that the three populations were of reasonable health, although one impoundment may be overstocked. The steady-state stocking densities depended on the desired consumption rate, and there was an eightfold difference in the stocking density aimed at providing large trophy fish and the density required to reach carrying capacity. 5. Model outputs of existing abundance and biomass density agreed with empirical estimates of abundance and relative density in these impoundments, which provides support to the models accuracy. This supplydemand approach to estimating the range of appropriate stocking densities shows promise as a decision-support tool for stocked impoundments and other closed fisheries.

J	Lucas, MC; Baras, E				Lucas, Martyn C.; Baras, Etienne			Methods for studying spatial behaviour of freshwater fishes in the natural environment	FISH AND FISHERIES												Spatial behaviour of fishes in fresh and brackish water ranges in temporal scales between localized diel movements, often associated with foraging and predator evasion, to seasonal or life-cycle related events involving movements between freshwater habitats or freshwater and marine biotopes. Recent technological advances have resulted in dramatic improvements in the range of techniques available for the study of spatial behaviour of freshwater fishes in the natural environment, and broadly may be divided into two categories: capture dependent and capture independent. The former incorporates those methods that rely on sampling marked fish (mark recapture) or unmarked fish (density estimates, catch per unit effort) over defined scales of time and space in order to derive information on distribution and movement. Captured fish may also be tagged with transmitters that radiate energy, enabling the fish to be tracked and/or environmental data to be gathered. Biochemical analysis of samples from fish, requiring non-destructive sampling (genetic analysis and scale microchemistry) or destructive sampling (otolith microchemistry) may also provide information on migration and ontogenetic processes. Capture independent techniques include visual observation and video techniques, hydroacoustics and automated fish counting. Catch per unit effort and mark recapture techniques are most efficient where long-term fishery or monitoring studies are in place and data on crude spatial and temporal scales are acceptable. They also have the advantages of low technical requirements and low equipment costs. Where specific management or ecological questions are pertinent, recapture independent techniques may be more appropriate. Telemetric methods can provide high resolution information at the individual level, while hydroacoustics is increasingly providing information at the population level in large lake and river environments. Biochemical methods are becoming increasingly useful in determining the extent of population segregation, where DNA analysis is used, and in the study of migration and ontogenetic changes in behaviour, where otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analysis is used.

The quality of water creates a new sign for the public to prevent them from waterborne diseases. This study uses sensitive water quality parameters obtained from the northeast monsoon season, October 2021, at different locations in Mooli Kulam lake (11 degrees 07 ' 17.6 '' N, 77 degrees 22 ' 59.9 '' E) of Tiruppur District, Tamil Nadu, India. The parameters considered for the analysis of lake water quality are closely included with drinking and irrigation parameters. The northeast monsoon samples collected from the lake were analysed and the Water Quality Indexing was applied to the dataset using three methods, namely, the Weight Arithmetic method, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment, and Horton's method. The parameters are divided into drinking water variables and irrigation water variables. This study includes water quality index mapping using Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation of the spatial distribution method using ArcMap 10.8. The dataset was subjected to correlation and regression analysis in order to determine the most significant pollutant. A total of 10 sampling stations and 23 water quality parameters have been analysed. The results obtained show that the lake has high eutrophication with compounds of potassium, iron, and nitrates.					; Ladu, Nyagong Santino David/GLT-3007-2022; Mageshkumar, P/E-9618-2018; Mageshkumar, P./E-9618-2018	KRN, Ashwin/0000-0001-5544-0319; Ladu, Nyagong Santino David/0000-0002-1128-186X; Selvaraj, Arulmozhi/0000-0001-6441-2897; Arumugam, Rangaraj/0000-0001-7234-6789; A, GOPALAN/0000-0002-2218-7238; Mageshkumar, P./0000-0002-7172-1804; P, MUKESH/0000-0003-1500-0778; ESAKKI RAJAN, PRASATH/0000-0003-3617-2405													1687-8434	1687-8442				AUG 1	2022	2022								3402951	10.1155/2022/3402951	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/3402951													WOS:000862773600004

Weathering and soil erosion from the lake catchment areas, the inflow of large number of tourists, drainage outlets, etc. pose a serious threat to two urban lakes, namely, Pichola and Fateh Sagar in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. Subsequently, stringent water quality monitoring programmes are required to assess the water quality of these two lakes in two distinct seasons, i.e., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. In this research study, the measured physicochemical parameters were computed for the water quality index (WQI), organic pollution index (OPI), and eutrophication index (EI) to evaluate the health of these lakes. The Pichola Lake had shown elevated concentrations for EC, TDS, DO, BOD, COD, TH, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42- as compared to Fateh Sagar. The mean nutrient concentrations were recorded to be higher in Pichola Lake (TN 3.99 mg/L; TP 0.15 mg/L) as compared to Fateh Sagar (TN 2.50 mg/L; TP 0.003 mg/L). The lower values registered in the post-monsoon period were due to the dilution effect caused by the rainfall and influx of runoff water. These two lakes contribute significant ecological and economic value to the area, helping to meet the water requirements for the surrounding population, agricultural practices, and tourists. Therefore, the present study can provide essential information about taking up appropriate measures to protect the water quality of urban lakes and the need to implement better management policies and initiatives for the same.					; Rai, Atul Kumar/IUM-9136-2023	Auddy, Nilabhra/0009-0003-1717-535X; Rai, Atul Kumar/0000-0002-2640-3188; Nayek, Sumanta/0000-0002-1164-4210														1751-231X				AUG	2022	17	8					1615	1634		10.2166/wpt.2022.078	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wpt.2022.078													WOS:000847040300005

In this study, the spatial distribution and area changes of the different types of wetlands in the Yellow-River-Source National Park (YRSNP) were obtained using the object-based classification method for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. The relationship between wetland change and climate factors was investigated by combining grey relation analysis and correlation analysis. The response of wetland change to different climatic factors was consequently clarified. The results showed that the river wetlands and lake wetlands increased significantly from the year 2000 to 2010 (4.04% and 4.21%, respectively). However, the total wetland area demonstrated a decreasing trend (7.08%), primarily due to the significant decrease in the marsh wetlands (6.81%). The total wetland area demonstrated a slightly increasing trend from the year 2010 to 2020 (0.14%), in which river wetlands and lake wetlands increased by 3.25% and 2.09%, respectively, while the marsh wetlands demonstrated a tendency to be stable. From the year 2000 to 2010, 75.53% of precipitation and 27.68% of temperature demonstrated a significant increase and an obvious warm-humid climate trend. However, from the year 2010 to 2020, the trend of increasing precipitation weakened, the temperature decreased slightly, and the warm-humid climate trend was not significant. From the year 2000 to 2020, the YRSNP river wetlands and lake wetlands were significantly and positively correlated with temperature and precipitation, while the marsh wetlands were most affected by climate warming, especially the warm-season temperatures.

Molting patterns were investigated by mixed models run on photoidentification data collected by camera trapping and digital camera surveys. Photoperiod was the predominant environmental variable affecting the molt but molting of females was also linked to air temperature and ice thickness. The cumulative proportion of molting seals peaked around the 18th-20th May, when day length reached 18 h. The main molting season, when most of the seals were hauled out at the same time, lasted on average for 16 days with considerable inter-annual differences in the duration (range 11-22 days). The results provide important baseline information on Saimaa ringed seal molt. Continued monitoring is important as the molt is an energetically demanding period for the seals, and any changes in molting behavior may indicate changes in habitat or in environmental conditions.

Understanding the leaching of heavy metals is necessary for developing efficient water quality improvement plans. This study investigated how arsenic leaches from different soil and sediment types and responds to hydrologic conditions to identify areas susceptible to arsenic contamination. In this study, batch- and column-leaching tests and sequential extraction procedures were used to examine arsenic leaching processes in detail. The results showed that most arsenic-loaded sediments accumulated in the vicinity of a reservoir inlet, and arsenic in reservoir beds have a higher leaching potential than those from agricultural land and stream beds. Arsenic deposited at the bottom of reservoirs had higher mobility than that in the other soils and sediments, and arsenic leaching was closely associated with the acidity of water. In addition, arsenic leaching was found to be responsive to seasons (wet or dry) as its mobilization is controlled by organic compounds that vary over time. The results suggested that temporal variations in the hydrochemical composition of reservoir water should be considered when defining a management plan for reservoir water quality.					; HER, YOUNG GU/Q-7975-2018; Her, Younggu/Q-7975-2018; Hwang, Soonho/AAI-7534-2021	Kang, Moon-Seong/0000-0001-7344-1905; HER, YOUNG GU/0000-0003-3700-5115; Song, Jung-Hun/0000-0002-0021-9227; HWANG, SOONHO/0000-0003-2152-077X														2076-3417				NOV	2019	9	21							4628	10.3390/app9214628	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9214628													WOS:000498058600153
J	Sassi, M				Sassi, Maria			Seasonality and Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture in Kenya: Evidence from Mixed-Methods Research in Rural Lake Naivasha Basin	SUSTAINABILITY												This study investigates the impact of seasonality within the debate on nutrition-sensitive agriculture focusing on rural Lake Naivasha Basin in Kenya, which presents an interesting case study of the food system in East Africa. Seasonality shapes food and nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa, dominated by a rain-fed system; however, lack of monthly data hampers understanding. Using mixed methods, this study constructs a monthly dataset of a representative sample of households from February 2018 to January 2019. A fixed-effects analysis highlights the association between three pathways from agriculture to nutrition while controlling for the hunger and harvesting seasons by crop. Supported by qualitative information from focus groups, the results suggest that seasonality is an important dimension of the agriculture-nutrition link and promote understanding of the complexity of the pathways suggested by the literature, including the association between crops and dietary diversity, with relevant policy implications.

Paleomagnetic, Sedimentological, and Isotopic Data on Neoproterozoic Periglacial Sediments of Siberia: A New Perspective on the Low-Latitude Glaciations Problem	IZVESTIYA-PHYSICS OF THE SOLID EARTH												Paleo- and rock magnetic, sedimentological, and isotope geochemical study is carried out for the carbonate member of Late Neoproterozoic Nichatka Formation (Siberian Platform, western slope of the Aldan Shield) enclosed within glacial deposits corresponding to the hypothetical event of "Snowball Earth" global glaciation. Based on the sedimentological, rock magnetic, and geochemical indications it is established that sediments composing this member have varve-type seasonal stratification and, according to our estimates, have been accumulated for at most 13 thousand years. Obtaining the detailed paleomagnetic data for the Precambrian varves allowed us to reveal a linear trend in the distribution of the virtual geomagnetic poles and to link it with the peculiarity of secular variation of the geomagnetic field during the time span of the Nichatka Formation. The paleomagnetic record in the periglacial sediments of the Nichatka Formation testifies to their deposition close to the equator which might be considered as supporting the Snowball Earth hypothesis. However, the absence of annual temperature fluctuations within the equatorial belt makes the formation of seasonal deposits at low latitudes barely possible and completely excludes such a possibility in the conditions close to total glaciation. The contradiction between paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic data is not explained in the context of the actualistic model of the geomagnetic field. The peculiarities of the paleomagnetic record in the Nichatka Formation, similar to the record of the field during the reversal, suggest that the geomagnetic field in the Neoproterozoic could be determined by substantial contribution of the low-latitude non-axial-dipole component. This peculiarity of the Neoproterozoic geomagnetic field can explain the entire set of the worldwide paleomagnetic data implying low latitude glaciations in the Neoproterozoic.

The hydrological loading effects over the Asian continent display strong latitude dependence. The significant hydrological loading effects appear at the GPS stations situated in the coastal areas, some regions near large rivers and lakes, and high-latitude areas in Russia, as evidenced by the fact that a large root mean square (RMS) and high percentage of the variance related to the annual signal modeled by singular spectrum analysis (SSA) for each measurement are cumulated at the stations located in these regions. In contrast, the hydrological loading effects are not pronounced in mid-latitude areas of the Asian continent (e.g., Central Asia, northern and plateau regions of China), which is due to the high topographical variability and scarce water resources in these regions. Then, the cross wavelet transform (XWT) is used to quantify the consistency between different data sets. For the data sets of GPS/GLDAS, the XWT-based semblance for 64% of the stations reaches above 0.8, while it reaches above 0.8 for 48% for the data sets of GPS/GRACE, indicating that the data sets of GPS/GLDAS present better consistency. In addition, we also discuss the effects of hydrological loading on GPS observations from the RMS value, noise characteristic, and velocity uncertainty. After applying the hydrological loading correction, the RMS values of almost all GPS observations are reduced with different amplitudes, implying that the hydrological loading correction can reduce the RMS values of most GPS observations in the Asian continent. Meanwhile, the variations of noise and velocity uncertainty suggest that hydrological loading has changed the noise characteristic of almost all GPS observations, and thus lead to the overestimation of velocity uncertainty.

Wind regime changes in the Euro-Atlantic region driven by Late-Holocene Grand Solar Minima	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Understanding atmospheric response to radiative forcing, including the intensity and distribution of wind patterns is critical as this might have important implications in the coming decades. Long-term episodes of reduced solar activity (i.e. Grand Solar Minima, GSM) have triggered rapid climate change in the past, recorded in proxy-based records, including varved sediments from Meerfelder Maar, Germany, where the Homeric GSM (similar to 2800 years ago) was studied. This study reconstructs windy conditions during the same GSM from Diss Mere, another varved record in England, to support the solar-wind linkage in the North Atlantic-European region. We use diatoms as proxies for windiness and support the palaeolimnological and palaeoclimate interpretation with a multi-proxy approach, including sedimentological, geochemical, and biological (chironomids and pollen) evidence. The diatom assemblage documents a shift from Pantocsekiella ocellata dominance to Stephanodiscus parvus and Lindavia comta, indicating a shift to more turbulent waters from similar to 2767 +/- 28, linked to increased windiness. This shift is synchronous with changes in C-14 production, linked to solar activity changes during the GSM. Both proxy records reflect a rapid and synchronous atmospheric response (i.e. stronger winds) at the onset and during the GSM in the North Atlantic and continental Europe. In order to test whether this solar-wind linkage is consistent during other GSMs and to understand the underlying climate dynamics, we analyse the wind response to solar forcing at the two study sites during the Little Ice Age, a period that includes several GSMs. For this, we have used a reconstruction based on a 1200-year-long simulation with an isotope-enabled climate model. Our study suggests that wind anomalies in the North Atlantic-European sector may relate to an anomalous atmospheric circulation in response to long-term solar forcing leading to north-easterlies modulated by the East Atlantic pattern.					; Langdon, Peter/B-4682-2013; Martin-Puertas, Celia/I-4580-2014; Sjolte, Jesper/N-7833-2019	Milner, Alice/0000-0001-6882-3992; Martin-Puertas, Celia/0000-0002-1349-5669; Tjallingii, Rik/0000-0002-9723-3622; Langdon, Peter/0000-0003-2724-2643; Sjolte, Jesper/0000-0003-0870-5331; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Harding, Poppy/0000-0002-2184-9455; Walsh, Amy/0000-0002-0194-0438													0930-7575	1432-0894				APR	2023	60	7-8					1947	1961	s00382-022-06388-w	10.1007/s00382-022-06388-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06388-w		JUL 2022											WOS:000833443600001

Breeding Seasonality in Female Vervet Monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) Living in an Anthropogenic Landscape	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												Resource availability is intricately linked to female reproductive success, and poor timing of reproduction can negatively impact maternal and/or infant survival. Thus, females should exhibit flexibility in the timing of reproduction that reflects local conditions. We examined eight years of data on births, conceptions, mating seasonality, and interbirth intervals (IBIs) in relation to food availability, weather, and female dominance rank in three groups of vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) living in a forest-agriculture matrix near Lake Nabugabo, Uganda. Births (N = 126) occurred year-round but were moderately seasonal (61.1% of births in October-December). The degree of seasonality varied slightly between groups. However, there was no survival difference for infants born within or outside of birth peaks. Fruit availability did not vary seasonally, nor did feeding on either natural or anthropogenic foods. IBI did not vary between groups but was shorter than those of other wild populations, with most females breeding in successive years. Higher-ranking females had shorter IBIs than lower-ranking females. The moderate breeding seasonality and shorter IBIs in the Nabugabo vervets compared with other populations may relate to habitat differences and latitudinally-variable factors. The maintenance of a birth peak despite consistent food availability suggests vervets and other primates may be phylogenetically constrained, which prohibits adapting to changing environmental conditions, such as climate change.					; Chapman, Colin/S-1911-2019	Chapman, Colin/0000-0002-8827-8140; Schoof, Valerie/0000-0002-6545-7736; Schwegel, Megan/0000-0002-5502-6350													0164-0291	1573-8604				FEB	2023	44	1					45	70		10.1007/s10764-022-00313-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10764-022-00313-y		JUL 2022											WOS:000833446800002

Currently, the lake has been facing alarming environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity due to the invasion of water hyacinth. Although the weed is invasive, it can be converted into various benefits. Hence, this study was conducted in North Eastern Lake Tana, Sheha Gomengie Kebele. The main objective is compost preparation in terms of its drying periods, analyses, and user perception. Physicochemical and nutrient analyses were performed according to the standard procedures. Acid digestion was used for heavy metal analyses. From the result, the pH measurements ranged from 7.619 +/- 0.195 to 7.719 +/- 0.261, and the moisture content ranged from 38.712 +/- 0.680 to 49.60 +/- 9.06%. The mean electrical conductivity (EC) values of all treatments of matured compost ranged from 2.780 +/- 0.542 to 3.51 +/- 0.971 ds/m. The TN values of the matured compost ranged from 0.420 +/- 0.379 to 0.754 +/- 0.194 on a dry weight basis. The overall mean values of the C:N ratio for all the treatments were 11.60 which is within an acceptable range. A high amount of available P concentrations was observed in all compost treatments which ranged from 2.740 +/- 0.190 to 2.940 +/- 1.410 g/kg. Moreover, the concentrations of heavy metals in all treatments were below the permissible limit of different agencies and there was also no significant difference in the mean values of analysis of variance at (P < 0.05). Therefore, the prepared compost can be recommended for better agricultural purposes. Considering users' understanding of compost preparation as an opportunity, converting WH into compost is promising in terms of its rich supply and the possibility of preparing in the dry season where labor is abundant. Therefore, it can be one way of sustainably reducing WH adverse effects on the Lakeshore.					; Teshome, Gizachew/MGT-9256-2025; Adugna, marelign/MVV-2348-2025; Alem, Teferi/MVT-9564-2025	Ayele, Dessie Tibebe/0000-0002-4779-7331; Teshome, Gizachew/0000-0001-9545-3827; Jembere, Kehali/0000-0002-1672-9408; Adugna, Marelign/0000-0002-4108-2570														2661-801X				JUL 30	2022	16	1							56	10.1186/s13065-022-00851-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13065-022-00851-9								35908069					WOS:000833503500001

The water from this basin receives industrial, urban, and rural waste from many sources. The mussel species Limnoperna fortunei was chosen based on population data, distribution, and sensitivity. Previous tests with comet assay and micronuclei frequency in this freshwater mussel have shown to be successful in biomonitoring studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic contamination of the Guaiba Lake Hydrographic Region, through the determination of damage by the micronuclei and comet assays in L. fortunei (golden mussel). Nine sampling sites were evaluated in three different seasons: five sites in the mouths of the main rivers that flow into Guaiba lake; one site at the mouth of a stream; one major site of sewage discharge; two sites at Guaiba lake, near a sewage discharge; and the control site in a preservation area. DNA damage was detected by the single cell gel assay, as well as the frequency of micronuclei in hemocytes of mussels exposed under laboratory conditions for 7 days to water and sediment samples. Significant results were found in different seasons in almost all sampling sites (P < 0.05, ANOVA Dunnet's test). Most of the positive results were found in samples affected mainly by urban effluents. It was possible to observe that there was a weak relation between mutagenic and genotoxic responses and mussels inorganic elements contents. Seasonal variation was observed at different sampling sites, but always indicating a huge contamination near urban sewage discharge. These results are consistent with previous studies, allowing us to infer that urban contamination is the biggest problem in this region. It is also possible to infer that L. fortunei is a good sentinel organism for the Guaiba Basin.

J	Drake, JM				Drake, JM			Allee effects and the risk of biological invasion	RISK ANALYSIS					Risk Assessment for Invasive Species Workshop	OCT 21-23, 2001	New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM		New Mexico State Univ			The Allee effect is a nonlinear phenomenon exhibited in the population dynamics of sparse populations in which the per capita population growth rate increases with increasing population density. In sufficiently sparse populations, the Allee effect may lead to extinction and is known to generate a threshold in the probability of establishment when presented as a function of introduced population size or density. As introduced populations are generally small, Allee effects are probably common in biological invasions and their consideration is necessary for accurately assessing the risk of invasion by many species, including all sexually reproducing species. Bythotrephes longimanus, an invasive, freshwater, cladoceran zooplankter from Europe, is one such species. Here, I review a previously published model of the Allee effect for continuously sexually reproducing species. Then, I develop a new model for seasonally parthenogenetic species such as Bythotrephes, and thereby demonstrate the potential consequences of Allee effects. This result underscores the importance of considering nonlinear phenomena, including thresholds, when conducting risk analysis for biological introductions.

Four farms were visited during the harvest season in 2012. Samples of strawberries, irrigation water, soil and hand swabs were collected and analyzed for E. coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella and STEC Although fecal indicators and pathogens were found in environmental samples, only one of 80 samples of strawberries was positive for E. coli (1.0 log(10) cfu/g) and pathogens were not detected in any of the strawberry samples. The water samples from all irrigation sources were contaminated with E. coli in numbers ranging from 0 to 3.3 log(10) cfu/g.Campylobacter (8/16 samples) and Salmonella (1/16 samples) were isolated from samples with high numbers of E. coli. The water samples collected from a lake had lower numbers of E. coli than the samples from rivers and a stream. The present study indicated continuous background contamination in the primary production environment. Although the background contamination was not reflected on the strawberries tested here, the results must be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of samples.																			1660-4601					JUN	2015	12	6					6919	6932		10.3390/ijerph120606919	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph120606919								26090606					WOS:000357268500074

Upper Lake is a freshwater lake, which is the major source of drinking water in the city of Bhopal, the capital city of M.P., the central province of India, but due to anthropogenic activities this lake is being polluted. During the investigation heavy metals and physicochemical parameters were analyzed to determine the water quality seasonally in the year of 2006 and 2007. All the physicochemical parameters except DO (6.50-6.97 mg l(-1)), Free CO2 (0.8-1.6 mg l(-1)) and BOD (5.47-6.85 mg l(-1)) were below the prescribed limit as recommended by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for drinking water standards. In case of heavy metals, Ni (0.173-0.253 mg l(-1)) and Cr (0.047-0.087 mg l(-1)) were found beyond the prescribed limits (0.02 and 0.05 mg l(-1), respectively), whereas Pb (0.057-0.087 mg l(-1)), Cu (0.016-0.020 mg l(-1)) and Hg (0.0006-0.0011 mg l(-1)) were within the safe limit. This study reveals that water of upper lake is partially polluted with heavy metals. It is recommended that strict vigilance and constant monitoring are needed to maintain water quality of the lake, which is a major source of potable water for the Bhopal city.																			0007-4861	1432-0800				FEB	2011	86	2					168	174		10.1007/s00128-010-0172-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-010-0172-0								21170704					WOS:000286934500006

Temperature, redox, and amendments alter wetland soil inorganic phosphorus retention dynamics in a Laurentian Great Lakes priority watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Surface water phosphorus loading must be reduced to improve water quality and decrease harmful algal blooms. Many wetlands have a natural capacity to retain inorganic reactive PO43- via soil sorption. However, soil PO43- retention capacity is finite and may be limited by soil legacy phosphorus effects in agricultural and urban areas. This study evaluated soil PO43- retention in soils from a wetland constructed on former agricultural land in the Lake Erie, Maumee River watershed targeted for nutrient load reduction. Soil PO43- sorption isotherms were evaluated under cool (10 degrees C), warm (22 degrees), aerobic, and anaerobic treatments to determine changes in PO43- retention due to environmental conditions and estimate seasonal changes in PO43- sorption. The soils displayed a strong capacity for PO43- retention by sorption. However, results indicate that cooler temperatures and anaerobic conditions decreased PO43- sorption and lowered retention rates at PO43- concentrations observed in the region. Soil amendment experiments investigated opportunities to increase PO43- retention because many soils display elevated phosphorus concentrations due to historic land use, limiting their ability to adsorb additional PO43-. Amendments increased PO43- retention capacity compared to unamended soils in the presence of high PO43- concentrations, suggesting soil PO43- retention can be improved in areas where natural storage capacity has been exhausted. Results from this study can inform natural resources managers in the Laurentian Great Lakes and elsewhere when identifying potential nutrient reduction wetland locations and assist with developing operational guidelines to optimize PO43- retention and water quality improvements using wetlands.

J	Ismail-Meyer, K				Ismail-Meyer, Kristin			The potential of micromorphology for interpreting sedimentation processes in wetland sites: a case study of a Late Bronze-early Iron Age lakeshore settlement at Lake Luokesa (Lithuania)	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Lake Luokesa lies in the eastern part of Lithuania and is part of a region of lakes formed by the Scandinavian ice-sheet and its melt waters during the last glaciation. During the Late Bronze-Early Iron Age transition, between 625 and 535 cal BC, a lakeside settlement with an onshore palisade was built on the platform of a carbonate bank. A total of five profiles, each comprising an organic occupation layer and lake sediments at its bottom and top, were examined micromorphologically. In this paper, natural and anthropogenic processes that led to the formation of the individual layers are presented; their possible origins are reconstructed and then discussed and compared to lakeside settlements of the circum-alpine region. This includes the emergence of lake marl, accumulation of organic layers in the settlement area as well as their decomposition, erosion and trampling features and inwash of sand through runoff from the hinterland. Due to the accumulation of the up to 60 cm thick culture layers in waterlogged environments, indications of seasonal deposition cycles could be identified.					; Ismail-Meyer, Kristin/HGB-6440-2022	Ismail-Meyer, Kristin/0000-0002-0398-6907; 													0939-6314	1617-6278				JUL	2014	23	4			SI		367	382		10.1007/s00334-014-0459-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-014-0459-x													WOS:000338232900004
J	Meyer, A; Prygiel, E; Laplace-Treyture, C				Meyer, Albin; Prygiel, Emilie; Laplace-Treyture, Christophe			Performance of a multimetric index based on phytoplankton to evaluate the ecological quality of French large rivers: The IPHYGE index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Large rivers around the world are impacted by human activities. Such activities can lead to the eutrophication of these water bodies, and consequently to potentially harmful algal blooms. In this study, we describe the development of a phytoplankton-based multimetric index used for the biomonitoring of the ecological quality of large rivers located in metropolitan France, as advocated by the European Water Framework Directive. Using a dataset containing phytoplanktonic surveys sampled over the 2010-2021 period for a total of 963 station-years, we calculated biomass-based and trophic metrics. We then selected the best biomass-based metric and several trophic metrics based on their ability to highlight situations impaired by eutrophication and/or algal blooms and well correlated to pressure gradients (i.e. using coefficients of determination). The best biomass-based metric was calculated from both the seasonal average and maximal concentrations of chlorophyll-a. Three trophic metrics, created using the Weighted Average - Partial Least-Squares method, were included in the multimetric index. Each metric is correlated with one parameter of interest, namely with total phosphorus, Kjeldahl nitrogen and nitrates. The values of the biomass metric and the three trophic metrics were aggregated to calculate the final value of the IPHYGE index ("Indice Phytoplancton pour les Grands cours d'Eau"; phytoplankton index for large rivers) in order to obtain the best relationship with the eutrophication pressure. Ecological quality classes derived from the index values were well related to gradients of parameters linked to eutrophication, for example total phosphorus and nitrogen compounds.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2024	166								112303	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112303		JUL 2024											WOS:001275089800001

The choice of a water quality monitoring model depends on many factors, including the source of the data and the purpose of the study. In this study, a model for determining the concentration of chlorophyll-a in the dry season over a 6-year period (from 2019 to 2024) was built based on 6 spectral bands of Sentinel-2 satellite images and the results of an analysis of 22 water environment samples according to 4 regression models: Log-Log, Log-Lin, Lin-Log and Lin-Lin. The model results revealed that the chlorophyll-a concentration exhibited the strongest linear correlation in the blue and green spectral bands. As a result, we constructed a map of the chlorophyll-a concentration for the dry season Hinh River basin from 2019 to 2024 using the log-lin model, which has the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 1.2). According to the log-lin model, the chlorophyll-a concentration reached an average of 3-5 mu g/L. During the dry season, the concentration of chlorophyll-a fluctuated primarily in rivers and streams, whereas it remained highly stable in reservoirs. In summary, this study constructed a model for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations in surface water environments in river basins based on satellite images. The findings of the present study serve as an essential dataset for surface water quality monitoring programs in river basins.					; Oanh, Nguyen/HZK-4570-2023; Tran, Bach/HCH-3137-2022; Ngo, Dung/HHS-4847-2022	Ngo Trung, Dung/0000-0002-3074-7135; 													2363-6203	2363-6211				AUG	2024	10	4					5813	5829		10.1007/s40808-024-02102-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-024-02102-3		JUL 2024											WOS:001268659300002

Applying early warning indicators to predict critical transitions in a lake undergoing multiple changes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Lakes are dynamic ecosystems that can transition among stable states. Since ecosystem-scale transitions can be detrimental and difficult to reverse, being able to predict impending critical transitions in state variables has become a major area of research. However, not all transitions are detrimental, and there is considerable interest in better evaluating the success of management interventions to support adaptive management strategies. Here, we retrospectively evaluated the agreement between time series statistics (i.e., standard deviation, autocorrelation, skewness, and kurtosis-also known as early warning indicators) and breakpoints in state variables in a lake (Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada) that has improved from a state of eutrophication. Long-term (1980 to 2019) monitoring data collected fortnightly throughout the ice-free season were used to evaluate historical changes in 15 state variables (e.g., dissolved organic carbon, phosphorus, chlorophyll a) and multivariate-derived time series at three monitoring stations (shallow, middepth, deep) in Lake Simcoe. Time series results from the two deep-water stations indicate that over this period Lake Simcoe transitioned from an algal-dominated state toward a state with increased water clarity (i.e., Secchi disk depth) and silica and lower nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, which coincided with both substantial management intervention and the establishment of invasive species (e.g., Dreissenid mussels). Consistent with improvement, Secchi depth at the deep-water stations demonstrated expected trends in statistical indicators prior to identified breakpoints, whereas total phosphorus and chlorophyll a revealed more nuanced patterns. Overall, state variables were largely found to yield inconsistent trends in statistical indicators, so many breakpoints were likely not reflective of traditional bifurcation critical transitions. Nevertheless, statistical indicators of state variable time series may be a valuable tool for the adaptive management and long-term monitoring of lake ecosystems, but we call for more research within the domain of early warning indicators to establish a better understanding of state variable behavior prior to lake changes.

Sap flux-upscaled canopy transpiration, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency in an old growth forest in the Great Lakes region of the United States	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] Combining sap flux and eddy covariance measurements provides a means to study plant stomatal conductance and the relationship between transpiration and photosynthesis. We measured sap flux using Granier-type sensors in a northern hardwood-dominated old growth forest in Michigan, upscaled to canopy transpiration, and calculated canopy conductance. We also measured carbon and water fluxes with the eddy covariance method and derived daytime gross primary production (GPP). The diurnal patterns of sap flux and canopy transpiration were mainly controlled by vapor pressure deficit (D) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Daily sums of sap flux and canopy transpiration had exponential relationships to D that saturated at higher D and had linear relationships to PAR. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniesis) had higher sap flux per unit of sapwood area than eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), while sugar maple and hemlock had higher canopy transpiration per unit of leaf area than yellow birch. Sugar maple dominated canopy transpiration per ground area. Canopy transpiration averaged 1.57 mm d(-1), accounting for 65% of total evapotranspiration in the growing season. Canopy conductance was controlled by both D and PAR, but the day-to-day variation in canopy conductance mainly followed a negatively logarithmic relationship with D. By removing the influences of PAR, half-hourly canopy conductance was also negatively logarithmically correlated with D. Water use efficiency (WUE) had a strong exponential relationship with D on a daily basis and approached a minimum of 4.4 mg g(-1). WUE provides an alternative to estimate GPP from measurements of sap flux.

One of these functions is the ability to bind elements forming geochemical barriers. The research aimed to study the geochemical conditions of natural wetlands and flooded paddy fields (artificial wetlands) in the Ganjiang River basin to trace geochemical barriers. The research approach was based on a comprehensive analysis of water and aqueous extracts from bottom sediments and paddy soils, including chemical and mineral composition. The samples were collected in November 2019, during the dry season at the end of harvesting. Chemical analysis was performed using standard methods for natural substances: titrimetry, photometry, ionic chromatography, high-temperature oxidation, ICP-MS, and ICP-AES. The mineral composition of the soils and sediments was determined by XRD. It was found that the main physicochemical characteristics (TDS, pH, main component concentrations) of the natural wetland water correspond to the surface water of the study area, whereas the irrigation water is similar to shallow groundwater. The content of trace elements in the irrigation water is higher than in the natural wetland water. Generally, the trace element composition of the natural wetland water corresponds to the geochemical background of the study area. Analysis of the mineral and chemical composition of the paddy soils and sediments indicates the geochemical barriers that accumulate a wide range of elements. In the natural wetland, the geochemical barrier is likely associated with a decrease in oxygen content and advective transport rate in the sediments, whereas in the paddy fields, the precipitation of clay minerals in the soil profile forms the geochemical barrier related to a decrease in filtration properties and advection-diffusion transport.					; Soldatova, Evgeniya/B-7096-2016; Toropov, Andrey/GPS-8981-2022; Dogadkin, Denis/AGH-5915-2022; Gromyak, Irina/JOK-2243-2023	Gromyak, Irina/0000-0003-2030-993X; Toropov, Andrey/0000-0001-7759-2831; Soldatova, Evgeniya/0000-0003-3967-4822; Dogadkin, Denis/0000-0002-6207-0130; 													2523-3963	2523-3971				JAN 13	2021	3	1							134	10.1007/s42452-020-04060-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-04060-8													WOS:000608211300005

Larval and early juvenile fish dynamics in main channel and backwater lake habitats of the Illinois River ecosystem	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The spatial and temporal complexity of large river ecosystems likely promotes biological diversity within riverine larval fish assemblages. However, the focus of most previous riverine studies of larval fish distribution has tended to concentrate mainly on backwater habitats. There has been less focus on the value of the main channel for larval fishes. We sampled two habitats types (three main channel sites and three backwater lakes) along 20 km of the Illinois River ecosystem during 2 years to compare the larval fish distribution along both spatial and environmental gradients between these habitats. Across the 2 years of this study, we found similar trends in the spatial and temporal distribution of larval fish, although there were some differences in densities between years. The relative abundance and size of many of the different fish taxa varied among habitats. Centrarchids, clupeids, poeciliids, cyprinids (excluding common carp) and atherinids were more abundant within backwater lake habitat. In contrast, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), sciaenids, moronids and catostomids were more abundant in main channel habitats. Furthermore, sciaenid and clupeid larvae captured in the backwater lake habitat were larger as the season progressed than those captured in the main channel. Our study suggests that larval fish show habitat specialisation, similar to adults, indicating that both the backwater lakes and the main channel are both important for larval fish and preserving the diversity of the fish assemblages in large floodplain rivers.

Through the collection of monitoring data from 2016 to 2023 in Chagan Lake, the first development of ecological criteria for ammonia nitrogen and risk evaluation for Northeast China was carried out based on the secondary ecological risk models (the quotient value method and joint probability curve). In addition, the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) model is improved through the use of genetic algorithms to identify more suitable ammonia water-quality benchmarks for ecological risk assessment. The results showed that high ammonia nitrogen concentration in wet season is primarily influenced by agricultural irrigation and drainage activities, whereas the dry season is driven by low temperatures and the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. The biological benchmark of improved SSD model with a genetic algorithm has a maximum error reduction of 23.84 % compared with other distributions, which is more than twice that of the median water-quality benchmark under the traditional Class III water-quality standard and empirical formula. Risk evaluation using traditional water-quality standards leads to the overprotection of the biological environment. Evaluations using quotient value methods and joint probability curves yield consistent results. The severity of the ecological risk of ammonia nitrogen follows the order: wet season > flat season > dry season. Using a genetic algorithm to optimize SSD model can effectively reduce the uncertainty of the model, providing a more accurate and reasonable ammonia nitrogen water-quality benchmark. This study improves the evaluation of the ecological risk of ammonia nitrogen in Lake Chagan, provides ideas for reducing the uncertainty of the selection of ammonia nitrogen water-quality benchmarks, and effectively prevents the overprotection of the lake from ammonia nitrogen.

Recent research from the Fayum basin of Egypt, which holds archaeological evidence for early use of domesticates, aims to place inhabitants of that region within their contemporary environmental setting. We present here results of wood charcoal analysis from three early- and middle-Holocene deposits on the north shore of the Fayum and reconstruct both contemporary woodland ecology and patterns of anthropogenic wood use. In total, three woodland communities likely existed in the area, but inhabitants of this region made heavy use of only the local lakeshore woodland, emphasizing tamarisk (Tamarix sp.) for fuel. While seasonally watered wadi woodlands were not harvested for fuel, more arid locations on the landscape were, evidencing regional mobility between ecological zones. Results indicate that wood was locally abundant and that inhabitants were able to select only preferred species for fuel. This study provides further evidence for low-level food production in the Fayum that preserved critical ecosystem services, rather than dramatic niche construction to promote agriculture as seen elsewhere in middle-Holocene Southwest Asia.					; Holdaway, Simon/AAE-5069-2020; Marston, John/J-8248-2012; Wendrich, Willeke/ABA-6744-2020	Marston, John M./0000-0002-1412-9695; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2017	27	12					1812	1824		10.1177/0959683617708443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617708443													WOS:000417713200002

Accelerated mass movement activities due to increased rainfall in the Nainital township, Kumaun Lesser Himalaya, India	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												Nainital township is known to be vulnerable to landslides and related mass movement activities since past and their record in the area dates back to as early as 1867. Previous studies estimate that about half the area of Nainital basin is covered with debris generated by landslides. GPR studies carried out in the area confirm that the thickness of the debris on the slope varies between 2 and 10 m. Geologically, the area constitute limestone, shale and slate belonging to Blaini, Krol and Tal formations of the Lesser Himalaya. These rocks are traversed by a major Nainital Lake Fault that runs all along the area in the NW-SE direction and the Hanumangarhi Fault that runs almost E-W. The off-shoots of these faults have also been many sections. The geotechnical properties of rocks and soils constituting the slope like poor rock mass conditions, negligible cohesion and moderate friction angle of the debris material also constitute a propensity towards its failure. It has further been observed that the area receive higher amount of rainfall particularly after 2009. There is an increase of about 73% annual precipitation as well as precipitation during monsoon season. This has caused the intensity of rainfall to have risen from 30 mm per day during 1995-2009 to 51 mm per day during 2010-2015. This increased rainfall intensity in the township has caused many slopes in the area to fail.

The analysis was made using 32 samples of water taken at 8 defined sites in the lake in different months of the year, following protocol established by Mexican standards. The results showed that the lake water has acceptable physicochemical and microbiological qualities for the protection of aquatic life. The K-Means method was used to regionalise the lake into clusters. The distribution of the variables is seen to differ in the rainy and dry seasons and it is also seen that the cluster pattern reflects the dominant direction of lake currents, thus providing easily accessed identification of the areas in which changes in water quality are greatest. To assess the activities taking place in the basin readily available public information was consulted. The pressures faced by the lake were identified applying a Pressure-State-Response framework. The results showed that the pressures on the lake are mainly caused by anthropogenic activities and that while the water quality is within the range "good to excellent", it is important to establish stricter criteria, closer to international standards, in order to maintain and conserve this quality. Thus a series of strategies and recommendations are given in the article, which should lead towards sustain ability. The methodology presented can easily be used in other places where little data exists and where it is hoped to exploit available freshwater as well as preserving its optimal quality.

Spatial heterogeneity, or patchiness, has been recognized as an important feature in a number of lake systems. In this study, we analysed changes in the seasonal dynamics of fish community in a subtropical lake over one year, focusing on the spatial and temporal distribution of fish biomass and species composition. Mangueira is a large shallow lake (3 m deep in average, 90 km long, 3-10 km wide, approximate to 820 km(2)) located along the Atlantic coast-line in southern Brazil (33 degrees 31'22"S 53 degrees 07'48"W). Mangueira Lake presents longitudinal gradients in both biotic and abiotic factors, and a principal components analysis (PCA) showed temporal and spatial gradients in the system. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed significant differences between the north and south extremes of Mangueira Lake. Secchi transparency (p < 0.001), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (p = 0.03) and chlorophyll a (p < 0.001) were identified as the driving factors for this spatial gradient. A two-way ANOVA was adjusted for each data set. Chlorophyll a (p = 0.017), fish captures (p = 0.033) and fish richness (p = 0.026) were different according to the sampling site (after removing the seasonal effect), while only fish richness presented significant seasonal variation after removing the sampling site effect (p = 0.041). This longitudinal gradient can be related to two main driving pressures. The first is prevailing winds from northeast to southwest, with predictable consequences for the whole trophic cascade. The other structuring pressure is the interface of the Taim wetland with northern Mangueira Lake. Thus, the northern part presents more turbid water, muddy sediments and increased chlorophyll a concentration, while the southern part is characterized by increased water transparency, less chlorophyll a concentration and more PVI (percent volume infested) of submerged macrophytes, demonstrating the spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem.

J	Brett, MT; Muller-Navarra, DC				Brett, MT; Muller-Navarra, DC			The role of highly unsaturated fatty acids in aquatic food web processes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY					1st International-Plankton-Ecology-Group Workshop on the Role of Food Quality for Zooplankton	MAR 17-21, 1996	CTR LIMNOL, NIEUWERSLUIS, NETHERLANDS	Int Plankton Ecol Grp	CTR LIMNOL			1. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are almost exclusively synthesized by plants. Animals can convert from one form of PUFA to another through elongation and desaturation, but very few can synthesize PUFA de novo. PUFA play an important role in regulating cell membrane properties, serve as precursors for important animal hormones and are essential for animals. 2. In aquaculture studies, highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA), a subset of PUFA, have been found to be critical for maintaining high growth, survival and reproductive rates and high food conversion efficiencies for a wide variety of marine and freshwater organisms. 3. The plankton Literature suggests high food-quality algae species are rich in HUFA and low food-quality algae are poor in HUFA. Adding semi-pure emulsions of HUFA to algae monocultures can markedly increase the growth Fates of zooplankton feeding on these mixtures. 4. A study measuring zooplankton biomass accrual when feeding on natural phytoplankton found a strong correlation between phytoplankton HUFA (specifically eicosapentaenoic acid) content and herbivorous zooplankton production. 5. The aquatic ecology literature suggests that planktonic foodwebs with high HUFA content phytoplankton have high zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratios, while systems with low HUFA phytoplankton have low zooplankton biomass. Also, the seasonal succession of plankton in many temperate lakes follows patterns tied to phytoplankton HUFA content, with intense zooplankton grazing and 'clear-water-phases' characteristic of periods when the phytoplankton is dominated by HUFA-rich species. 6. Herbivorous zooplankton production is constrained by the zooplankton's ability to ingest and digest phytoplankton. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that much of the phytoplankton which is assimilated may be nutritionally inadequate. HUFA may be key nutritional constituents of zooplankton diets, and may determine energetic efficiency across the plant-animal interface, secondary production and the strength of trophic coupling in aquatic pelagic foodwebs.

The DF sampling was performed using the ASTM method D-1739 from April 2017 to March 2018 in four urban and suburb sampling sites around Tabriz, Iran. The ICP-OES was utilized for the determination of the elemental components of DF. The results showed that the level of DF varied from 1.3 to 27.6 (8.0 +/- 3.4) g/m(2).month during the sampling period, and the level of DF was higher in warm seasons than cold seasons. Also, it was revealed that the mean DF has a direct and significant relationship with temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity. The elements of Fe (11,997-17,093 mg/Kg and 71-81%) and Al (2903-6852 mg/Kg and 14-25%), which are the main elements of the Earth crust, were the dominant metals of DF among the analyzed elements. The lowest average value of the enrichment factor (EF) was for Al and was < 1, while the highest EF belonged to Hg, Pb, Cu, Sr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cr, which were > 10 in all the sites, indicating that anthropogenic emission sources spread a considerable amount of trace elements in DF compared to the Lake Urmia bed or soil. The EF values for various elements (except than Cu and Hg) in cold seasons considerably increased compared to warm seasons. In all the study sites, Fe (540-1307 mg/m(2).yr) had the highest deposition rates among the metals. This study revealed that the Earth crust is the main source of DF in the region.

Spatial and temporal variations of a saxitoxin analogue (LWTX-1) in Lyngbya wollei (Cyanobacteria) mats in the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada)	HARMFUL ALGAE												The concentration of the saxitoxin analogue LWTX-1 was quantified in samples of the benthic filamentous cyanobacterium Lyngbya wollei (Farlow ex Gomont) Speziale and Dyck collected in two fluvial lakes of the St. Lawrence River (Canada) over the 2006-2013 period. The study was aimed at documenting the spatial (between fluvial lakes, between sites within each lake) and temporal (inter annual, monthly) variations of toxin concentration in relation with hydrological (water level), physical (water temperature, conductivity, transparency), chemical (nutrients in overlying water) and biological (L. wollei biomass and mat condition) characteristics. Toxin concentration was hypothesized to vary seasonally with biomass accumulation and environmental conditions. Toxin concentrations measured in Lake. Saint-Louis (51 +/- 40 mu g LWFX-1 g(-1) DM, N = 29 days in 2007, 2009-2011) were double those in Lake Saint-Pierre (25 +/- 31 mu g LWTX-1 g(-1) DM, N = 26 days in 2006-2008, 2012-2013); however, August 2007 measurements taken from both lakes did not differ significantly. Ten of the twelve highest values (>100 mu g LWTX-1 g(-1) DM) were obtained from Lake Saint-Louis, between April and October in 2007, 2010 or 2011. Under ice samples showed intermediate concentrations of LWTX-1 (42 +/- 9 mu g LWTX-1 g(-1) DM, N = 2). Concentrations of LWTX-1 were positively correlated with. Secchi depth (r = 0.59, p < 0.001), L. wollei biomass (Spearman r = 0.31, p < 0.01) and %N in filaments (r = 0.48, p < 0.001), suggesting toxin production was linked to mat growth and metabolism rather than water quality. Although LWTX-1 has been reported to have a low toxicity, monitoring of L. wallet abundance is required to assess the environmental and human health risks posed by this taxon in the St. Lawrence - Great Lakes system.

J	Jung, HC; Alsdorf, D				Jung, Hahn Chul; Alsdorf, Doug			Repeat-pass multi-temporal interferometric SAR coherence variations with Amazon floodplain and lake habitats	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												We have analysed interferometric coherence variations in Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data at three central Amazon sites: Lake Balbina, Cabaliana and Solimoes-Purus. Because radar pulse interactions with inundated vegetation typically follow a double-bounce travel path that returns energy to the antenna, coherence will vary with vegetation type as well as with physical and temporal baselines. Lake Balbina consists mostly of upland forests and inundated trunks of dead, leafless trees whereas Cabaliana and Solimoes-Purus are dominated by flooded forests. Balbina has higher coherence values than either Cabaliana or Solimoes-Purus probably because the dead, leafless trees support strong double-bounce returns. The mean coherences of flooded woodland are 0.28 in Balbina and 0.11 in both Cabaliana and Solimoes-Purus. With increasing temporal baselines, flooded and nonflooded wetland habitats show a steadily decreasing trend in coherence values whereas terra-firme and especially open-water habitats have little variation and remain lower in value. Flooded and nonflooded wetland coherence varies with the season whereas terra-firme and open water do not have similarly evident seasonal variations. For example, flooded habitats in all three study regions show annual peaks in coherence values that are typically 0.02 greater than coherence values from temporal baselines 180 days later, yet open water shows no variation with time. Our findings suggest that, despite overall low coherence values, repeat-pass interferometric coherence of flooded habitats is capable of showing the annual periodicity of the Amazon flood wave.

J	Zeng, XQ; Rasmussen, TC				Zeng, XQ; Rasmussen, TC			Multivariate statistical characterization of water quality in Lake Lanier, Georgia, USA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Watershed monitoring programs depend on water quality characterization data collected for many parameters, at many times and places, and with limited resources. Our objective is to present a strategy that reduces the measured parameters, locations, and frequency without compromising the quality of the monitoring program. One year of twice-monthly (growing season) and monthly (dormant season) water quality data collected from 17 lake and 10 tributary sites are used in conjunction with multivariate statistical techniques to improve the utility of collected data by identifying key parameters and monitoring locations. Factor analysis shows that tributary water quality data consists of three components-stormwater runoff, municipal and industrial discharges, and ground water-which can be distinguished using total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, and alkalinity plus soluble reactive P, respectively. Lake water quality characterization is more ambiguous than tributary water quality characterization, but factor analysis indicates that anoxia associated with lake stratification is the largest source of lake water quality variation, followed by nutrient abundance, and finally by biomass abundance. Cluster analysis suggests that tributary and lake monitoring stations can be consolidated. Reducing the number of parameters and stations frees up resources for increased monitoring elsewhere.

Two periods have been detected within this data set-years with decreased DOM until the middle of 1980s and then years with increased DOM until 2000. Temperature, hydrological regime of runoff from the catchment (namely the amount of interflow), and changes in atmospheric deposition of acidity coincided with the variations in DOM concentrations. The analysis of single runoff events confirmed the relation between the export of increased DOM concentrations from the catchment and interflow. A multiple linear regression model based on monthly averages of temperature and interflow explained 67% of DOM variability. This model suggested a 7% increase in DOM concentration under the scenarios of possible future climate change related to doubled CO(2) concentration in the atmosphere. The scenarios were based on results of several global circulation models.. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xu, CY; Singh, VP				Xu, CY; Singh, VP			Evaluation and generalization of temperature-based methods for calculating evaporation	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Seven temperature-based equations, each representing a typical form, were evaluated and compared for determining evaporation at two climatological stations (Rawson Lake and Atikokan) in north-western Ontario, Canada. The comparison was first made usings the original constant values involved in each equation, and then using the recalibrated constant values. The results show that when the original constant values were used, larger biases existed for most of the equations for both stations. When recalibrated constant values were substituted for the original constant values, six of the seven equations improved for both stations. Using locally calibrated parameter values, all seven equations worked well for determining mean seasonal evaporation values. For monthly evaporation values, the modified Blaney-Criddle method produced least error for all months for both stations, followed by the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods. The Linacre, Kharrufa and Hamon methods showed a significant bias in September for both stations. With properly determined constant values, the modified Blaney-Criddle, the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite methods can be recommended for estimating evaporation in the study region, as far as temperature-based methods are concerned.

Information on the factors structuring chironomid communities is important to understand their ecological aspects and to improve the interpretation of paleolimnological records based on the analyses of subfossil assemblages. The chironomid community of Lake Moreno Oeste exhibited spatial heterogeneity, with four distinctive groups of taxa associated with different substrate types: (1) macrophyte Myriophyllum sp. (mainly represented by Parapsectrocladius escondido, Parachironomus sp. and Apedilum griseistriatum); (2) submerged riparian leaves (Ablabesmyia sp.); (3) deep sediment (Cryptochironomus sp. and Polypedilum sp.2.); and (4) littoral and sublittoral sediment (Riethia truncatocaudata and Djalmabatista). Along the sampling period, significant seasonal changes in chironomid composition were observed in substrates from sublittoral and littoral zones; however, a relatively stable community was recorded in the deeper zone. In Lake Moreno Oeste, the spatiotemporal structure of chironomid larvae assemblages is mainly driven by the substrate type and environmental factors associated with depth, such as organic matter content, sediment granulometric composition, and dissolved oxygen. The results presented here contribute to our understanding of chironomid ecology in North Patagonia and constitute an essential step forward to improve biomonitoring and paleolimnological studies in lacustrine environments in the region.

An initial analytical study had been carried out before the construction. In this paper, a simplified two-dimensional model is developed to simulate the steady lake water temperature (LWT) distribution during continuous operation. The simulation results indicate that the impacts of the discharge on entering water temperatures (EWT) and the ecological environment of lake are acceptable. Field test results showed that the COP values of the system were, respectively, 0.7-0.85 higher in cooling season and about 0.46 higher in heating season than those of the air-source heat pump (ASHP) units at the same sink and source temperatures. An acceptable payback period of 5.6 years was found through an economic analysis based on the comparison between the initial and operating costs of the system and those of the distributed ASHP units that would have been installed according to initial scheme.

J	Mol, JH; Ouboter, PE				Mol, JH; Ouboter, PE			Downstream effects of erosion from small-scale gold mining on the instream habitat and fish community of a small neotropical rainforest stream	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Small-scale gold mining has caused widespread siltation of South American streams, but little information is available on the effects of an increased load of suspended and deposited sediment on diverse Neotropical fish communities. We used a paired watershed design to compare the instream habitat and fish community structure of an undisturbed rainforest stream and a stream affected by gold mining. In the period 1994-2001, the affected stream showed high turbidity (424-2874 nephelometric turbidity units), high concentration of suspended sediment (318-2468 mg/L), and elevated concentrations of potassium, aluminum, and iron. Mercury was detected in the low-water season (0.67 mug/L). The main fractions of P, Al, and Fe were associated with suspended sediment and were not in solution. The sediment load of the polluted stream (3.10 +/- 0.77 tonnes/year/ ha) was mainly (95.6%) produced by the eroding goldfields. Sedimentation was evident from the accumulation of a 23-cm-thick layer of fine sediment (<100 mu m) on the streambed. The deposited sediment covered most structural elements of the streambed and thereby reduced instream habitat diversity. The fish community of the stream affected by gold mining showed low species diversity, low proportion of young fishes, high proportion of midchannel surface-feeding fishes and fishes adapted to low light, low proportion of visually orienting fishes and fishes that hide in leaf-litter banks and woody debris, and low relative biomass of food fishes. These results suggest that erosion related to small-scale gold mining reduces fish diversity and shifts community structure because of (1) increased turbidity resulting from an increased load of suspended sediment and (2) a reduction of instream habitat diversity related to sedimentation. Gold mining occurred over 7 years and is still occurring, but the sediment stored in the streambed is expected to pose a pollution problem long after the gold miners have left the area.

To improve altimeter ranging accuracy and in turn to get better surface height measurement, contaminated waveforms should be retracked against geophysical corrections. In this paper, an improved threshold retracker (ITR) is developed to retrack waveforms over lakes. ITR considers not only the physical characteristics of the reflecting surface, but also the stochastic feature of waveform, and two new retrackers, the N-Beta function model, and the N-5-Beta function model, are also put forward to develop the waveform retracking program of this study. TOPEX/POSEIDON waveforms over Hulun Lake in the North China are retracked to monitor the temporal lake level variations. A comparison with the in situ hydrological data indicates ITR is very efficient to monitor the lake level variations with the retracked altimetric data. The result of our study shows accurate seasonal level variations and the descending trend of Hulun Lake.						guo, jinyun/0000-0003-1817-1505; Chang, Xiaotao/0000-0002-8860-2270													1939-1404					JUN	2009	2	2					80	86		10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2021673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2021673													WOS:000276104800006

ANNUAL NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF MACROPHYTES IN THE EASTERN AMAZON FLOODPLAIN	WETLANDS												Aquatic herbaceous macrophytes contribute significantly to the input carbon for the Amazon floodplain. These plants have large seasonal variations in areal coverage and high productivity. The present study estimates annual net primary production (NPP) of aquatic herbaceous macrophytes in a large lake on the eastern Amazon floodplain, assesses the sources and amount of uncertainty associated with these measures, and offers a comparison among the estimates of herbaceous macrophyte productivity in the Amazon region. Plant biomass accumulated during the rising water stage of the annual flood cycle, peaking at 2300 to 6100 g m(-2) and decreasing later in the year. Annual net primary production was estimated to range from 2400 to 3500 g m(-2) yr(-1), with above water production between 650 and 1100 g m(-2) yr(-1), and below water production between 1700 and 2600 g m(-2) yr(-1). Echinochloa polystachya and Paspalum fasciculatum were the most productive species, followed by Paspalum repens, Hymenachne amplexicaulis, and Oryza perennis. The four main sources of uncertainty in the estimates were macrophyte taxa, location, sampling design, and lack of measurements of dead material loss.

Biting flies and Trypanosoma vivax infection in three highland districts bordering lake Tana, Ethiopia	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												An epidemiological study was conducted to determine the prevalence of trypanosomosis in cattle, small ruminants and Equidae, and to identify biting flies; potential mechanical vectors of trypanosomes in the three districts of Bahir Dar Zuria, Dembia and Fogera, bordering lake Tana, Ethiopia. About 1509 cattle, 798 small ruminants and 749 Equidae were bled for the prevalence study using the buffy-coat method and the measurement of the hematocrit value. Sixty-six NGU and 20 monoconical traps were deployed for the fly survey. The results indicated the presence of trypanosomes in 6.1% (92/1509) of the cattle with a maximum during the late rainy season (9.6%) than the early dry season (3.6%) at Fogera district. Prevalence at the district level varied from 4% to 9.6%. Only one sheep (1/122) and one goat (1/676) were found positive for T vivax-like trypanosomes and none of the Equidae was positive. All the trypanosomes encountered in cattle belong to the single species of T vivax. The PCV was negatively associated with detection of T vivax (21.6% in infected versus 25.4% in non-infected cattle). A total of 55,398 biting flies were caught of which 49,353 (89.08%) belong to Stomoxys, 4715 (8.51 %) to horse flies and 1330 (2.4%) to Chrysops species. There was no tsetse fly. Species identification has indicated the presence of Atylotus agrestis, Chrysops streptobalia, Stomoxys calcitrans, S. nigra, S. pulla, S. pallida, S. sitiens, S. taeniata, S. uruma, Haematopota lasiops and Hippobosca variegata. The overall apparent density was 214.7 flies/trap/day. Seasonal comparison showed higher fly catches in the lite rainy season than the early dry season. This study indicated that T vivax infections culminate in cattle at the same time as mechanical vectors such as Stomoxys sp. and Arylotus agrestis. Therefore, attention towards T vivax infection in cattle is essential to control the impact of the disease on productivity. A further study on biting flies is recommended. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study comprehensively analyzed the concentrations, distribution, potential sources, and health risk of 7 PTEs in multimedia (seawater, sediment and organism) in typical subtropical bays in southern China. The results indicated that Zn was the most abundant element in seawater, and the average concentration of Cd in sediment was 3.93 times higher than the background value. Except for As, the seasonal differences in surface seawater were not significant. The content of Zn in fishes, crustacea, and shellfish was the highest, while the contents of Hg and Cd were relatively low. Bioaccumulation factor indicated that Zn was a strongly bioaccumulated element in seawater, while Cd was more highly enriched by aquatic organisms in sediment. According to principal component analysis (PCA), and positive matrix factorization (PMF), the main sources of PTEs in Quanzhou Bay were of natural derivation, industrial sewage discharge, and agricultural inputs, each contributing 40.4 %, 24.2 %, and 35.4 %, respectively. This study provides fundamental and significant information for the prevention of PTEs contamination in subtropical bays, the promotion of ecological safety, and the assessment of human health risk from PTEs in seafood.

We investigated the Qingshuihe Basin (a Late Cenozoic basin located between the Tianjingshan and Qingshuihe faults in the north-eastern SNATB) using field geological surveys combined with borehole, high-density resistivity, and optically stimulated luminescence dating. Four distinct stages in the tectonic evolution of the Qingshuihe Basin since the Late Miocene are identified, corresponding to four tectonic events in the local region influenced by the Tibetan Plateau expansion. First, the Late Miocene experienced several significant events, including tectonic stress field transitions, sedimentary hiatus, and sudden environmental changes, which may have been the first local tectonic activity due to the north-eastward expansion of the Tibetan Plateau. Second, the Early-Middle Pleistocene growth strata in the Hejiakouzi valley (controlled by the Hejiakouzi anticline and Tianjingshan Fault) suggest that the basin-range-style tectonic features were basically formed in the SNATB. Third, geological investigations of lacustrine sedimentation reveal that two palaeolakes were present during the Late Pleistocene. Significant phase transitions and a sedimentary hiatus during the Late Pleistocene in the lake formations indicate a transformation of the sedimentary environment, which marked the beginning of the left-lateral strike-slip of the Tianjingshan Fault. Finally, the broad distribution of second-level river terraces along the banks of the Qingshuihe and other seasonal rivers close to the Tianjingshan indicate the effect of the north-eastward expansion of the Tibetan Plateau on the local tectonic evolution. We elucidate the stratigraphy, major unconformities, and river terraces formed since the Late Miocene in the Qingshuihe Basin, providing important information regarding the tectono-topographical-sedimentary system.

At the surface, DGM production was mainly photomediated, with reduction rates being twice as high in the wetland than in the lake. In the water column, the distribution of DGM concentrations was not strictly related to light but followed a multimodal distribution, with peaks encountered below the epilimnion at depths receiving <5% of the incident light. Those peaks were recorded in the middle and at the bottom of the metalimnion during the ice-free season, as well as under ice cover and at the bottom of an anoxic hypolimnion. Rather than being a consequence of the bacterial mercuric reductase activity, metalimnetic DGM peaks were associated with the intensity and duration of phytoplankton blooms. In situ incubation experiments also showed that DGM production ceased when samples were kept in the dark, filtered, or when an inhibitor of photosynthesis was added. Our results illustrate the important role of phytoplankton on Hg redox dynamics in the water column of lakes.

The geology of the area is mainly composed of basalts, rhyolitic ignimbrites, and Quaternary sediments. Hydrogeochemistry and the source of ions in the groundwater of the study area are poorly understood. Therefore, the current study aims to assess the factors and the different hydrochemical processes significantly controlling groundwater quality, source, and chemistry. For this purpose, a total of eighteen groundwater samples were collected using 250 ml sampling bottles at selected points in the dry season (May 2017) and wet season (November 2017). Gibbs diagram, correlation analysis, scatter plots of ionic molar ratio relations, saturation index values (estimated using PHREEQC Interactive 2.8) were used to decipher the hydrogeochemical process. Gibbs diagram shows that the rock-water interaction process is the predominant, Na+/Cl- and Ca2+/Mg2+ molar ratio value of all groundwater samples in both seasons reveals that the groundwater chemistry of the area is controlled by silicate minerals weathering. The strong correlation of Ca2+ with Mg2+ in the dry season, and Ca2+ with HCO3- and Na+ with HCO3- in the wet season could also be an indication of silicate weathering and ion exchange processes. The impact of anthropogenic practices on groundwater chemistry is also seen from the strong correlation of Ca2+ with Cl-, NO3-, PO43-, and F-, NO2- with K+, Mg2+, and PO43-, PO43- with F- , and NO3- with Na+, Cl-, HCO3- . The negative values of chloro-alkaline indices in both seasons indicate base-exchange reaction where an indirect exchange of Ca2+ and Mg2+ of the water with Na+ and K+ of the host rock occurs. Saturation indices results for the wet season show that the groundwater is under-saturated with respect to calcite, aragonite, dolomite, gypsum, and anhydrite. In the dry season, however, some of the waters are oversaturated with respect to calcite and aragonite. To sum up, the groundwater quality of the study area is controlled by geological processes and anthropogenic effects.					; Berhe, Berihu Abadi/MVT-8932-2025	Tesema, Fethangest Woldemariyam/0009-0006-1167-132X; Berhe, Berihu Abadi/0000-0001-5841-9689; Suyum, Gebreslassie Mebrahtu/0009-0007-3150-725X													2073-073X						2021	13	1					21	42		10.4314/mejs.v13i1.2	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/mejs.v13i1.2													WOS:000685507400002
J	Guan, YF; Zheng, FR				Guan, Yunfei; Zheng, Furong			Alterations in the Water-Level Regime of Tonle Sap Lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												The Tonle Sap Lake (TSL), located in southwestern Mekong Basin, is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. The water-level regime of the TSL has been changing over the last few decades due to the rapid development of water infrastructures and climate change in the Mekong Basin. This paper makes efforts to quantify the water-level regime alterations of the TSL by analyzing the pre- and post-1991 historical data of daily water levels from Kompong Luong Station. The method of modified indicators of hydrologic alteration was utilized, and the TSL's hydrological behavior was explored further by focusing on the redistribution of hydrology and unfavorable disturbances. The results reveal that the coefficients of variation of most indicators in recent years increase compared with the preimpact years from 1960 to 1990. This demonstrates that the Mekong Basin and TSL are experiencing an increasingly unstable and varied hydrological cycle, which is more susceptible to interference with increased frequency and degree. Moreover, the system may have suffered more unfavorable human interference in dry years and in the dry season. It is expected that the findings in this paper will contribute to the protective development and adaptive management of the Mekong Basin and the TSL in the future.																			1084-0699	1943-5584				JAN 1	2021	26	1							05020045	10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0002013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0002013													WOS:000661469100001

Understanding these transport processes is important, as they can affect the lake water budget, or biogeochemical cycles in lakes due to nutrient inputs. We present here a seasonal Rn-222 mass balance of Lake Burullus (Northern Egypt), the second largest lake of Egypt. The Lake receives Rn-222 from drainage water and the decay of Ra-226, and loses Rn-222 via decay of Rn-222, atmospheric evasion and water discharge into the Mediterranean Sea. However, the mass balance reveals a significant surplus of Rn-222, which cannot be explained by the previously mentioned processes. The Rn-222 surplus is especially high during the dry season, and might be explained by groundwater discharge and pore water exchange which transports Rn-222 into the lake. Higher Rn-222 fluxes into the lake during dry season might be explained by higher bioirrigation rates due to warmer temperatures, or higher groundwater discharge rates due to a higher hydraulic head on land caused by excessive irrigation in adjacent fields. Groundwater discharge and pore water exchange should be investigated in further detail in order to understand if they have effects on water budgets and biogeochemical cycles of Lake Burullus.					; Imam, Noha/AAC-4161-2022; Moosdorf, Nils/B-3851-2009	Moosdorf, Nils/0000-0003-2822-8261; imam, noha/0000-0001-5807-7009; 													0265-931X	1879-1700				JAN	2021	226								106368	10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106368								33077303					WOS:000597158600001

Data from 120 sampled respondents were collected through extensive personal interviews; field observation and the collected data were processed in a (SPSS) statistical package for social science. The study identified six main value-chain actors (fishermen, fishermen cooperatives, wholesalers, processors, retailers, and end-users/consumers) who were involved in value-adding, supplying, collecting and marketing, and consuming, but still there were slightly strong market linkage among actors. They lack a win-win strategy in the overall share of cost and profit. For instance, of the value-chain actors in districts, fishermen share high costs but as evident, they earn little profit. The sector faces many production constraints (lack of modern knowledge and poor harvesting and storage facilities, illegal fishing materials, weak governance, and many harvesting sites) and marketing constraints (price fluctuation, poor quality supply-insufficient value-added and seasonality of market). However, to ensure the benefit of the actors and profitability of the sector there should be a need for building good governance for better proper management of monitoring and evaluation and thereby strengthen the chain.

J	Shi, X; Sun, J; Xiao, ZJ				Shi, Xi; Sun, Jian; Xiao, Zijun			Investigation on River Thermal Regime under Dam Influence by Integrating Remote Sensing and Water Temperature Model	WATER												River water temperature (RWT), a primary parameter for hydrological and ecological processes, is influenced by both climate change and anthropogenic intervention. Studies on such influences have been severely restricted due to the scarcity of river temperature data. This paper proposed a three-stage method to obtain long-term daily water temperature for rivers and river-type reservoirs by integrating remote sensing technique and river water temperature modelling. The proposed three-stage method was applied to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and validated against in situ measured RWTs in the two study sites, Cuntan and Huanglingmiao. The result showed improvements in the method: the quadrate window selection and RWT correction jointly reduce RMSE from 1.8 to 0.9 degrees C in Cuntan and from 2.1 to 1.2 degrees C in Huanglingmiao. As a whole, the estimated daily RWT has a consistent RMSE of 1.1-1.9 degrees C. Meanwhile, by analysing the Landsat-derived daily RWT, we demonstrated that the TGR had a significant impact on the outflow's thermal regime. At the downstream reach of TGR, an apparent increase in RWT in the cold season and interannual thermal regime delay compared to inflow were found with the increasing water level after the dam construction. All the results and analyses indicate that the proposed three-stage method could be applied to obtain long time series of daily RWT and provide a promising approach to qualitatively analyse RWT variation in the poorly gauged catchment for river water quality monitoring and management.

It plays an important role in the ecological process of the water environment and directly affects human production and life, the ecological environment system of the water area, and the diversity of organisms. In order to adjust and improve the ecological conditions of the watershed, it is necessary to obtain a large amount of effective lake surface water temperature data, and use this as a basis to analyze the temporal and spatial change process of the LSWT. This study uses MODIS (MOD11A2) surface temperature product data to obtain the LSWT of Dianchi Lake, and then analyzes the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the LSWT of Dianchi Lake on different time scales (year, season, month) during the day and night. The research results show that the annual, seasonal and monthly average values of the LSWT during the day and night are all increasing from 2001 to 2017. The average annual temperature rise rate of Dianchi LSWT during the day and night is 0.09 degrees Cyr(-1) and 0.05 degrees Cyr(-1), respectively. The spatial analysis results show that the LSWT increase area of Dianchi Lake is expanding.																			1755-1307						2021	658								012005	10.1088/1755-1315/658/1/012005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/658/1/012005													WOS:000685506000005
J	Dar, T; Rai, N; Kumar, S; Bhat, A				Dar, Tanveer; Rai, Nachiketa; Kumar, Sudhir; Bhat, Aadil			Spatiotemporal dynamics of stable isotopes of different water sources in western Himalayas: Insights into regional hydrological processes	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The spatiotemporal variations in stable isotope ratios are primarily related to atmospheric moisture transport. However, the isotopic composition of stream water is significantly influenced by the diverse landscape of glaciated and snow-dominated basins. The present study investigates the spatiotemporal variation of the isotopic composition of stream water and potential water sources such as rain, snowmelt, glacier melt, lakes, and groundwater in the Upper Jhelum River Basin (UJRB). Our findings reveal that the significant seasonal variability of precipitation is mainly associated with the transition between westerlies (WDs) and the Indian Southwest Monsoon (ISWM), each conveying distinct moisture to the UJRB. The isotopic signature in rain is actively controlled by the combined effect of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) during WDs. However, the impact of "amount effect" with lower condensation temperature is dominant during the latter half of ISWM. Seasonal variations in delta 18O and d-excess in stream water are distinct, influenced by different contributing sources and topographic controls. A linear relationship is observed between delta 18O vs. altitude and glacier area ratio (GAR). Lower delta 18O in stream water and higher d-excess values are observed in the southwest at higher elevations in glacier-fed tributaries. In the northern side, higher delta 18O in stream water indicates contributions from nonglacier fed tributaries and enhanced groundwater contributions rather than merely following the lower delta 18O of precipitation along the strengthened WDs gradient. The delta 18O isotopic lapse rate (ILR) of rain (-0.19%o/100 m) is higher compared to ILR for the river (- 0.05%o/100 m), reflecting the mixing of water sources in river water. However, both are lower than the global average (-0.28%o/100 m). This study helps in understanding the influence of meteorological, topographic factors and other water sources on stream water, a prerequisite for projecting a potential future change in the complex Himalayan region.					; Rai, Nachiketa/D-9859-2015; Kumar, Sudhir/ABE-6793-2020	Dar, Tanveer/0000-0002-9590-7072; Rai, Nachiketa/0000-0002-2358-7962; 													0883-2927	1872-9134				SEP	2024	170								106038	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.106038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.106038		JUL 2024											WOS:001264055700001

The mechanisms of water and nutrient uptake by plants depend on climatic and edaphic conditions, as well as the plant root system. Soil solution is the medium in which abiotic and biotic processes exchange nutrients, and nutrient concentrations vary with the abundance of reactive minerals and fluid residence times. High-altitude ecosystems of the tropical Andes are interesting for the study of the association between vegetation, soil hydrology, and mineral nutrient availability at the landscape scale for different reasons. First of all, because of low rock-derived nutrient stocks in intensely weathered volcanic soils, biocycling of essential nutrients by plants is expected to be important for plant nutrient acquisition. Second, the ecosystem is characterized by strong spatial patterns in vegetation type and density at the landscape scale and hence is optimal to study soil-water-vegetation interactions. Third, the area is characterized by high carbon stocks but low rates of organic decomposition that might vary with soil hydrology, soil development, and geochemistry, all interconnected with vegetation. The p & aacute;ramo landscape forms a vegetation mosaic of bunch grasses, cushion-forming plants, and forests. In the nutrient-depleted nonallophanic Andosols, the plant rooting depth varies with drainage and soil moisture conditions. Rooting depths were shallower in seasonally waterlogged soils under cushion plants and deeper in well-drained soils under forest and tussock grasses (>100 cm). Vegetation composition is a relevant indicator of rock-derived nutrient availability in soil solutions. The soil solute chemistry revealed patterns in plant-available nutrients that were not mimicking the distribution of total rock-derived nutrients nor the exchangeable nutrient pool but clearly resulted from strong biocycling of cations and removal of nutrients from the soil by plant uptake or deep leaching. Soils under cushion plants showed solute concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Na of about 3 times higher than forest and tussock grasses. Differences were even stronger for dissolved Si with solute concentrations that were 16 times higher than forest and 6 times higher than tussock grasses. Amongst the macronutrients derived from lithogenic sources, P was a limiting nutrient with very low solute concentrations (<1 <mu>M) for all three vegetation types. In contrast K showed greater solute concentrations under forest soils with values that were 2 to 3 times higher than under cushion-forming plants or tussock grasses. Our findings have important implications for future management of Andean p & aacute;ramo ecosystems where vegetation type distributions are dynamically changing as a result of warming temperatures and land use change. Such alterations may lead not only to changes in soil hydrology and solute geochemistry but also to complex changes in weathering rates and solute export downstream with effects on nutrient concentrations in Andean rivers and high-mountain lakes.

Habitat suitability of biocrust communities in a cold desert ecosystem	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Drylands are unique among terrestrial ecosystems in that they have a significant proportion of primary production facilitated by non-vascular plants such as colonial cyanobacteria, moss, and lichens, i.e., biocrusts, which occur on and in the surface soil. Biocrusts inhabit all continents, including Antarctica, an increasingly dynamic continent on the precipice of change. Here, we describe in-situ field surveying and sampling, remote sensing, and modeling approaches to assess the habitat suitability of biocrusts in the Lake Fryxell basin of Taylor Valley, Antarctica, which is the main site of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research Program. Soils suitable for the development of biocrusts are typically wetter, less alkaline, and less saline compared to unvegetated soils. Using random forest models, we show that gravimetric water content, electrical conductivity, and snow frequency are the top predictors of biocrust presence and biomass. Areas most suitable for the growth of dense biocrusts are soils associated with seasonal snow patches. Using geospatial data to extrapolate our habitat suitability model to the whole basin predicts that biocrusts are present in 2.7 x 105 m2 and contain 11-72 Mg of aboveground carbon, based on the 90% probability of occurrence. Our study illustrates the synergistic effect of combining field and remote sensing data for understanding the distribution and biomass of biocrusts, a foundational community in the carbon balance of this region. Extreme weather events and changing climate conditions in this region, especially those influencing snow accumulation and persistence, could have significant effects on the future distribution and abundance of biocrusts and therefore soil organic carbon storage in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Biocrusts are dominant primary producer communities inhabiting the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. We found that gravimetric water content, electrical conductivity, and snow frequency are the top predictors of biocrust presence and biomass. We predict that biocrusts are present in 2.7 x 105 m2 and contain 11-72 Mg of aboveground carbon in the Lake Fryxell basin, often occurring on soils associated with seasonal snow patches. Our study illustrates the synergistic effect of combining field and remote sensing data for understanding and predicting ecological dynamics in the context of a changing climate.image					; Barrett, John/D-5851-2016	Power, Sarah/0000-0002-4863-290X; Thomas, Valerie/0000-0003-2189-6013; 													2045-7758					JUL	2024	14	7							e11649	10.1002/ece3.11649	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.11649								38952663					WOS:001257391400001

However, the phase relationships between Milankovitch forcing mechanisms and hydrologic changes are ambiguous because of challenges in interpreting climate proxies and dating continental successions. We present an analysis of Miocene red and green mudstone rhythmites in two basins (Jiuxi and Guide, NE Tibet) using a climate proxy based on lithologic color. Time-series analysis of the color proxy indicated a dominance of 405 k.y. cycles, from which we constructed an orbital eccentricity metronome astrochronology from 18 Ma to 10 Ma. Periods of lake expansion and contraction are characterized by the green and red mudstones, respectively, and correspond to orbital eccentricity minima and maxima, respectively. We interpreted the antiphase relationship between orbital eccentricity and hydrologic evolution using a net precipitation model, with low precipitation/evaporation ratio being due to excessively high evaporation during times of high orbital eccentricity, and vice versa. High orbital eccentricity scenarios with strong seasonality and insolation extremes are analogous to anthropogenic global warming, and our results provide insights into a future of Central Asian intensified aridification, following the "dry gets-drier" global warming projections and regionally high aridity sensitivity.					; Hinnov, Linda/D-9486-2013	Yao, Xu/0009-0001-7003-4746; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL-AUG	2024	136	7-8					3457	3471		10.1130/B37129.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B37129.1													WOS:001271861600004

This study uses a narrative political ecology approach to document and analyze how people experiencing unsheltered homelessness along an urban riparian corridor in Salt Lake County, Utah, engage with seasonal episodic poor air quality. In-depth, on-site semi-structured interviews (n = 16) were conducted with individuals living in tents and other constructed shelters. Participant responses were developed into narratives focused on daily experiences with poor air quality, attributing the causes of air pollution, and locating responsibility for poor air quality. Responses demonstrate the power of participant narrative in their own analyses of lived experiences of wildfire smoke, haze, and seasonal inversion, as well as the ways these events influence broader conceptualizations about personal health, vulnerability, responsibilization, and power-infused nature-society relations.

J	Sanabria, J; Lhomme, JP				Sanabria, J.; Lhomme, J. P.			Climate change and potato cropping in the Peruvian Altiplano	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The potential impacts of climate change on potatoes cropping in the Peruvian highlands (Altiplano) is assessed using climate projections for 2071-2100, obtained from the HadRM3P regional atmospheric model of the Hadley Centre. The atmospheric model is run under two different special report on emission scenarios: high CO2 concentration (A2) and moderate CO2 concentration (B2) for four locations situated in the surroundings of Lake Titicaca. The two main varieties of potato cultivated in the area are studied: the Andean potato (Solanum tuberosum) and the bitter potato (Solanum juzepczukii). A simple process-oriented model is used to quantify the climatic impacts on crops cycles and yields by combining the effects of temperature on phenology, of radiation and CO2 on maximum yield and of water balance on yield deficit. In future climates, air temperature systematically increases, precipitation tends to increase at the beginning of the rainy season and slightly decreases during the rest of the season. The direct effects of these climatic changes are earlier planting dates, less planting failures and shorter crop cycles in all the four locations and for both scenarios. Consequently, the harvesting dates occur systematically earlier: roughly in January for the Andean potato instead of March in the current situation and in February for the bitter potato instead of April. Overall, yield deficits will be higher under climate change than in the current climate. There will be a strong negative impact on yields for S. tuberosum (stronger under A2 scenario than under B2); the impact on S. juzepczukii yields, however, appears to be relatively mixed and not so negative.

Spatial and temporal patterns of microbial mats and associated invertebrates along an Antarctic stream	POLAR BIOLOGY												Microbial biofilms are biological hotspots in many alpine and polar ecosystems, but the controls on and functional significance of their fauna are little known. We studied cyanobacterial mats and the underlying sediment in a glacial meltwater stream in the McMurdo Dry valleys, Antarctica. We investigated mat biomass (total and phototrophic), diatoms, and micro-meiofauna (nematodes, rotifers, and tardigrades) at nine sites along a 1670m stream reach in a cold, low-flow growing season, and in a warmer growing season in which peak flows (above 100Ls(-1)) scoured the mats. Diatom and invertebrate communities were not related, but mat biomass in the low-flow year was negatively related to nematode abundance, including that of the omnivore Eudorylaimus. In the high flow year that followed, invertebrate abundance was reduced in the mats, diatom community structure was altered, and mat biomass was higher. The difference in invertebrate abundance between years was greater in mats in upstream reaches, where the greatest increases in flow velocity may have occurred, and was negligible in mats in downstream reaches as well as in the sediment beneath the mats. Integrating our results with previous findings, we generate two predictive hypotheses to be tested in glacial meltwater streams: (1) under peak flows invertebrates decline in the microbial mats, while (2) the sediment beneath the mats is a refuge from the flow disturbance. Our results also suggest that, under stable flow conditions, microinvertebrate grazers could exert top-down control on microbial mat biomass.

In this study, Random Forests (RF) algorithm is used to build reservoir outflow simulation model to evaluate the value of hydrologic information. The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China is selected as a case study. As input variables of the model, the classic hydrologic information is divided into past, current and future information. Several different simulation models are established based on the combinations of these three groups of information. The influences and value of hydrologic information on reservoir outflow decision-making are evaluated from two different perspectives, the one is the simulation result of different models and the other is the importance ranking of the input variables in RF algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to reasonably simulate outflow decisions of TGR. It is shown that past outflow is the most important information and the forecasted inflows are more important in the flood season than in the non-flood season for reservoir operation decision-making.					; XU, TAO/HTS-9005-2023	He, Shaokun/0000-0002-4562-2319; Guo, shenglian/0000-0002-8594-4988														2073-4441				OCT	2018	10	10							1372	10.3390/w10101372	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10101372													WOS:000451208400087

We evaluated the relationship between the community structure of periphytic algae on Utricularia foliosa and macrophyte richness and coverage and limnological variables in a shallow reservoir. Water sampling for physical, chemical and biological analyses was performed at sites with contrasting macrophyte coverage and richness in each of the four main seasons of the year. Periphytic algae were evaluated for density and species composition. High densities of diatoms and filamentous cyanobacteria in the periphyton were observed at sites with high macrophyte coverage and richness, while high abundances of flagellates of Chrysophyceae and Chlorophyceae were found at sites with low macrophyte richness. Light and nutrient availability were determining factors of the temporal variability of the periphytic algae community. We concluded that the interaction between seasonality and spatial heterogeneity (macrophyte community structure and limnological variables), explained the variability in species composition and algal density of the periphyton. Therefore, seasonality and spatial heterogeneity acted as determining factors for periphyton structure on a free-floating macrophyte with high structural complexity.

Integrated hydro-and wind power generation: a game changer towards environmental flow in the Sub-middle and Lower Sao Francisco River Basin?	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Many renewable resources for the generation of electricity, such as hydropower and wind power, are dependent on climatic factors. Reservoirs have been created to overcome the stochastic nature of river flows and to make water supply more reliable. However, reservoirs are affecting the ecological status of river ecosystems, e.g., by modifying the flow regime, triggering discussions regarding the discharge of reservoirs. In Brazil's northeast region, the installed capacity for wind power generation has increased substantially in recent years. Setting up a modeling system for simulating wind power and hydropower generation in this study, it is analyzed whether wind power generation, peaking in the dry season, can help to achieve a more environmentally oriented flow regime in the Sub-middle and Lower Sao Francisco River Basin. Simulated higher discharges from reservoirs during the rainy season and lower discharges during the dry season, representing a more natural flow regime, will reduce hydropower generation in the dry season. Under recent conditions, the resulting gap in electricity generation can only be partially covered by wind power. A large share needs to be generated by thermal power plants or be imported from other regions in Brazil. The planned future increase in installed wind power capacity can change this picture; the demand for electricity generated by thermal power plants and imported will decrease. Adopting an integrated approach for hydropower and wind power generation, the flow regime in the Sub-middle and Lower Sao Francisco River Basin can be modified to improve the ecological status of the river system.

Analyzing the feasibility of a space-borne sensor (SPOT-6) to estimate the height of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in inland waters	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing based approaches have been widely used over the years to monitor and manage submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) or aquatic macrophytes mainly by mapping their spatial distribution and at the most, modeling SAV biomass. Remote sensing based studies to map SAV heights are rare because of the complexities in modeling water column optical proprieties. SAV height is a proxy for biomass and can be used to estimate plant volume when combined with percent cover. The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of a satellite sensor to estimate the SAV height distribution in an inland reservoir. Also to test different radiative transfer theory based bio-optical models for estimating SAV heights using SPOT-6 data. The satellite-based multispectral data have rarely been used and SPOT-6 data, to the best of our knowledge, have never been used to estimate SAV heights in inland water bodies. In addition to depth and hydroacoustic data, in situ hyperspectral radiance and irradiance were measured at different depths to compute remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and the attenuation coefficients (K-d and K-Lu). Two models, Palandro et al. (2008) and Dierssen et al. (2003), were used to derive bottom reflectance from both in situ and atmospherically corrected SPOT-6 R-rs. Bottom reflectance-based vegetation indices (green-red index, slope index, and simple ratio) were used to estimate SAV heights. Validation was performed using echosounder acquired hydroacoustic data. In situ model calibration produced an R-2 of 0.7, however, the validation showed a systematic underestimation of SAV heights and high Root Mean Square Error (RMSE); indicating that there is a greater sensitivity in in situ models to localized variations in water column optical properties. The model based on SPOT-6 data presented higher accuracy, with R-2 of 0.54 and RMSE of 0.29 m (NRMSE = 15%). Although the models showed a decreased sensitivity for SAVs at depths greater than 5 m with a height of 1.5 m, the finding nonetheless is significant because it proves that re-calibration of existing bottom reflectance models with more field data can enhance the accuracy to be able to periodically map SAV heights and biomass in inland waters. Although the initial results presented in this study are encouraging, further calibration of the model is required across different species, seasons, sites, and turbidity regime in order to test its application potential.

Facies architecture of the Stuttgart Formation (Schilfsandstein, Upper Triassic), central Germany, and its comparison with modern Ganga system, India	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Stuttgart Formation (Schilfsandstein) is approximately 50 m thick in Thuringia, representing deposition during the "Mid-Carnian Wet Intermezzo". Stratigraphically it occurs between the Grabfeld and Weser formations, which formed under arid conditions. It comprises NNE-SSW-trending elongate, anastomosing channelized sand-rich bodies with erosional bases (channel belts) that are several kilometres wide and pass laterally into predominantly mudstones deposited in interfluve areas. The source area of these clastics was the uplifted Norwegian Caledonides. Muddy interfluve facies is dominant in exposures in Thuringia, Central Germany. The Lower Stuttgart Formation has an unconformable base that is locally overlain by metre-thick "Basal Beds". These consist of grey mudstones and thin sandstones deposited under humid conditions in predominantly shallow brackish water environments after a marine ingression via the Eastern Carpathian/Upper Silesian Gate. The following 30-40 m-grey, fine-grained sandstones, siltstones and mudstones were deposited in fluvial environments in channel belts and interfluve areas under humid conditions. These are followed by predominantly reddish mudstones and sandstones of mainly fluvial origin, deposited under somewhat drier conditions with seasonal droughts. The Upper Stuttgart Formation may be more than 16 m thick: it comprises reddish and grey sandstones and mudstones that were mostly deposited in lake delta settings by recurring flash floods. During the deposition of this unit climate was weakly humid with less prominent seasonal draughts. The modern Ganga Plain of India is an analogue for the depositional setting of the Stuttgart Formation. Climatic conditions in Ganga Plain are humid monsoonal with seasonal droughts and roughly comparable with those interpreted for Mid-Carnian times in Germany. The sandy deposits of incised channel belts and channels and muddy deposits of interfluve areas in the Ganga Plain are comparable with the sandstonedominated channelized facies and mudstone dominated interfluve facies of the Stuttgart Formation, respectively.

J	Lewin, WC; Okun, N; Mehner, T				Lewin, WC; Okun, N; Mehner, T			Determinants of the distribution of juvenile fish in the littoral area of a shallow lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Research has often focused on the pelagic areas of lakes; the littoral zone has received less attention. The few studies concerning fish distribution in littoral habitats have concentrated on stands of submersed macrophytes, whereas other littoral habitat types have seldom been investigated. 2. This study aimed to predict the occurrence of juvenile fish in several littoral habitats of a shallow lake as a function of food availability, complexity of habitat structure, water depth and substrate. Habitats comprising reed, woody structures, and two open water areas differing in depth were sampled for fish and invertebrate biomasses on two shores, over 6 months and during both daylight and at night. 3. The juvenile fish community consisted almost exclusively of 0+ and 1+ roach and perch. There was a strong diel component in habitat use, with a predominant occurrence of fish in complex habitats (mainly woody structures) during the day, and a partial migration towards the open habitats at night, more strongly expressed in roach than in perch. 4. The diet of all fish groups was relatively constant over the seasonal cycle, and was independent of habitat. There was a higher degree of planktivory in roach than in perch, but both species fed on benthic macroinvertebrates to a substantial extent. 5. According to a logistic regression model, the biomass of potential food organisms in the different habitats had little predictive effect on the spatial distribution of the fish, whereas the structural complexity of the habitats combined with the diel cycle explained about 28% of the occurrence patterns in 0+ and 1+ perch and 1+ roach.					; Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008	Lewin, Wolf-Christian/0000-0001-6598-6489; Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X													0046-5070					APR	2004	49	4					410	424		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01193.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01193.x													WOS:000220272600005

In this work, an improved version of the multimedia model ChimERA fate, including a phytoplankton compartment and equations to calculate phytoplankton, detritus and dissolved organic matter variations in time, was developed. The model was parameterized to simulate five dynamic scenarios for shallow meso-eutrophic water bodies based on a latitudinal gradient (in Europe); such scenarios include seasonal profiles of water temperature, phytoplankton biomass, detritus, and dissolved organic matter. Model runs were performed for each scenario for 8 hydrophobic chemicals (PCB congeners), with the aim of investigating the influence of scenario characteristics and compound properties on bioavailable concentrations. The key processes were adsorption/uptake by phytoplankton and deposition to sediment of detritus-bound chemicals. The northern Scenarios ("Scandinavia" and "UK") showed the highest bioavailable concentrations, with annual maximum/minimum concentration up to 25; in contrast, for example, maximum concentrations in the "Mediterranean" scenario were lower by a factor of 2 to 9 with respect to the northern ones (depending on chemical hydrophobicity), due to the generally higher biomass and carbon levels, and showed only limited seasonal variability (up to a factor of 4). These results highlight the importance of including biomass and organic carbon dynamics in both modelling approaches and scenarios for the evaluation of exposure concentrations in aquatic environments.

Effect of capture frequency on the survival of Piping Plover chicks	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Evaluating the possible effects of intensive research on species being studied and on the results of studies is important for both ethical and scientific reasons. We captured, banded, recaptured, and measured prefledged Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) chicks during the 2010 breeding season at Lewis and Clark Lake on the Missouri River in South Dakota. We evaluated the potential for increased mortality related to frequent handling of chicks with an experiment that compared the survival of chicks handled a single time for banding (N = 48) to chicks handled repeatedly from hatch to fledge (N = 50). Estimates of daily survival rate (phi) for chicks in the two treatments did not differ (phi(single-capture) = 0.984 +/- 0.006, phi(multiple-capture) = 0.985 +/- 0.006). Similar to previous studies, we found little evidence of increased prefledge mortality associated with frequent handling of Piping Plover chicks. However, because the effects of frequent handling of shorebird chicks may vary among species and other factors such as habitat quality (e.g., food availability), we suggest that, where possible, researchers include experiments similar to ours to evaluate possible research impacts, especially when studying threatened and endangered species.

A FRESHWATER LAKE SAGA: CARBON ROUTING WITHIN THE AQUATIC FOOD WEB OF LAKE SCHWERIN	RADIOCARBON					21st International Radiocarbon Conference	2012	Paris, FRANCE					Recently, several case studies have demonstrated the presence of human radiocarbon dietary reservoir effects in inland contexts. Freshwater reservoir effects present a high degree of variability, making it difficult to define local reservoir effect reference values necessary for correcting chronologies based on C-14 dating of human bone material. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that C-14 ages of edible freshwater species are delimited by the C-14 ages of the main water carbon pools (DIC, POC, and DOC). Water, plant, algae, bivalve, and fish samples were collected from lakes Schwerin and Ostorf (Germany). C-14 and isotopic measurements were performed on the floral and faunal species and on water DIC, POC, and DOC. The results demonstrate the potential of the study area for large and variable freshwater reservoir effects. In the case of Lake Schwerin, the working hypothesis was verified as the C-14 ages of faunal and floral species were delimited by the C-14 ages of water DIC and POC, probably associated with 2 extreme categories of food chains (grazing and detritus). While the results obtained confirm the working hypothesis and suggest a relatively straightforward interpretation, further research is necessary to investigate possible spatial and seasonal variations.

Seasonal and scale-dependent variability in nutrient- and allelopathy-mediated macrophyte-phytoplankton interactions	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												macrophyte-phytoplankton interactions were investigated using a dual laboratory and field approach during a growing season, with responses quantified as changes in biomass. Short-term, close-range interactions in laboratory microcosms always led to mutual exclusion of macrophytes (Elodea canadensis or Ceratophyllum demersum) and algae (Raphidocelis subcapitata, Fistulifera pelliculosa) or cyanobacteria (Synechococcus leopoliensis), suggesting regulation by positive feedback mechanisms, progressively establishing and reinforcing a "stable state". Laboratory results suggest that close-range regulation of R. subcapitata and F. pelliculosa by macrophytes was primarily via nutrient (N, P) mediation. Sprig-produced allelochemicals may have contributed to inhibition of S. leopoliensis in C. demersum presence, while S. leopoliensis was apparently enhanced by nutrients leaked by subhealthy (discolored leaves; biomass loss) E. canadensis. Seasonal changes in algal growth suppression were correlated with sprig growth. Marginal differences in in situ phytoplankton patterns inside and outside monospecific macrophyte stands suggest that the nutrient- and/or allelopathy-mediated close-range mechanisms observed in the laboratory did not propagate at the macrophyte-stand scale. Factors operating at a larger scale (e. g., lake trophic state, extent of submerged vegetation coverage) appear to override in situ macrophyte-phytoplankton close-range interactions.

C., Canada - Characterization of a microbialite forming environment	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The objectives of this study are two-fold: (1) to describe and quantify the seasonal physical and chemical limnological properties of Pavilion Lake, a microbialite-rich lake in British Columbia, Canada, and (2) to gain a broader limnological context of Pavilion Lake by examining the limnology and hydrology of the lakes and groundwater systems in the area (similar to 30 km radius). Pavilion Lake is a dimictic lake with annual ice-cover. It is a hard water (mean CaCO3 = 181.8 mg L-1), ultra-oligotrophic (mean Total Phosphorus [TP] = 3.3 mu g L-1) lake, that is groundwater fed most likely through diffuse, low velocity local and regional sources. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) separated Pavilion Lake from the other groundwater, stream and lake samples along a conductivity and pH gradient on Axis 1 (lambda(1) = 0.392), and a nutrient (Total Nitrogen [TN], TP) and K+, Mg2+, Si gradient on the second axis (lambda(2) = 0.160). Pavilion Lake has the lowest Ca2+ and TP concentrations, and the highest Na+ concentrations and optical transmissivity amongst all sampled sites. Furthermore, the lake is characterized by low sedimentation rates. These characteristics are potentially important factors in supporting the past and on-going development of microbialites within the lake. Our study provides a limnochemical reference to consider in the conceptualization of ideal environments supporting large-scale microbialites.					; Saffari, Mohsen/AAD-2756-2022; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013; Forrest, Alexander/C-3765-2014; Laval, Bernard/J-9861-2012	Laval, Bernard Edmond/0000-0002-4810-9246; McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; Antoniades, Dermot/0000-0001-6629-4839; Andersen, Dale/0000-0001-8827-1259; Schulze-Makuch, Dirk/0000-0002-1923-9746; Forrest, Alexander/0000-0002-7853-9765; 													1863-9135						2009	173	4					329	351		10.1127/1863-9135/2009/0173-0329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2009/0173-0329													WOS:000264204800007

Expressed in microcystin-LR equivalents, high microcystin concentrations were recorded from August to December each year, reaching values of up to 6.7 mu g L-1. A significant correlation was found between the microcystin cell content and the cell densities of P. rubescens. Cellular quotas of microcystins ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 pg cell(-1). Simultaneously, laboratory experiments were performed on a strain of P. rubescens isolated from the lake to assess the potential impact of various 4 concentrations on intra- and extracellular microcystin production. Unlike natural populations, this strain only produced [D-Asp(3)] MC-RR. The intracellular microcystin content was similarly correlated to the cell density, but the cellular quota was slightly higher (0.3-0.7 pg cell(-1)) than in the natural population. Again, as in the natural population, a linear relationship was found between growth rate and microcystin production rate. These findings support the hypothesis that environmental factors, such as phosphate concentrations, have no direct impact on microcystin production by P. rubescens, but act indirectly by affecting growth rate.

Growing season energy and water exchange from an oil sands overburden reclamation soil cover, Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Joint Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union/Canadian-Meteorological-and-Oceanographic-Society/Eastern Snow Conference/American-Meteorological-Society	MAY 29-JUN 01, 2007	Newfoundland, CANADA					The oil sands mining industry in Canada is required to return mining areas to a land capability equivalent to that which existed prior to mining. During the reclamation process, ecosystems are created that bear little similarity to boreal forests that existed prior to mining. Quantifying the water balance of reclaimed ecosystems is critical in establishing whether there is sufficient moisture for vegetation growth and in the fate of salts, which can be toxic when drawn to the surface or leached out of the covers. At Syncrude Canada Ltd's Mildred Lake mine north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the surface energy balance was measured atop a reclaimed saline-sodic overburden pile during three growing seasons using eddy covariance. At the onset of the study, the dominant vegetation was foxtail barley, which changed to sweet clover in 2004, and a low-density species mix in 2005, including some aspen and white spruce seedlings. The 2005 growing season was cooler and wetter than 2003 and 2004, and there were seasonal differences in the delivery of precipitation among years. There were distinct differences in the surface energy balance among the study years related to weather, soil moisture, vegetation and stage of growth. Latent heat was the largest consumer of energy in 2003, and mid-day fluxes of sensible and latent heat were approximately equal. In 2004, sensible heat became the dominant flux, primarily due to prolonged dry periods, whereas the wet 2005 season had the greatest latent heat flux density of any year. Ground heat flux declined throughout the growing season and ranged between 3 and 17% of net radiation. Total evapotranspiration was 246, 224 and 283 turn for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. A total derivative analysis of the Penman-Monteith equation reveals the influence of available energy, vapour pressure deficit and surface conductance in controlling evapotranspiration.

Regional response of the coastal aquifer to Hurricane Ingrid and sedimentation flux in the Yax Chen cave system (Ox Bel Ha) Yucatan, Mexico	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Coastal karst aquifers are an important source of potable water which can be affected by external forcing on various temporal and spatial scales (e.g. sea-level) but there is a lack of long-term data to understand their response. Sediment cores and their proxy records have been used in lakes and oceans to assess past environmental change, but haven't been extensively applied to anchialine caves where there is less known about the physical, biological and chemical processes affecting sedimentation. Over fifty sediment traps were placed in Yax Chen which is part of the Ox Bel Ha cave system near Tulum, Mexico and four water level sensors were placed in two additional cave systems (Ponderosa, Sac Actun) for comparative water table fluctuations. Data collected over the past three years (2011-2013) captured seasonal and spatial sediment flux including the effect of an intense rainfall associated with Hurricane Ingrid (September 18, 2013). The data indicates that sediment deposition was controlled by cenote size and the presence of mangrove. Areas upstream of Cenote Gemini had negligible sediment accumulation as there were few cenotes and the terrain is dominated by lowland tropical forest, while areas downstream from Cenote Gemini were dominated by mangrove forests and larger cenotes which resulted in higher sediment accumulation rates (0.014 vs. 0.22 mg/cm(2)/day). Bi-annual sedimentation rates in 2013-2014 were higher in the months after the rainy season (0.2 vs. 0.5 mg/cm(2)/day) indicating that cenote productivity was likely controlling sedimentation. Mangrove areas with their peat accumulations occlude the porous karst causing funneling of nutrient rich rainwater into the sunlit cenotes enhancing primary productivity and sedimentation in downstream areas. Hurricane Ingrid had little effect on the yearly sediment rate even though water table fluctuations were high (0.7 m) compared to the yearly values (0.3 m). This likely is due to water bypassing the cenotes with little residence time to enhance productivity and sedimentation in downstream areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

High-resolution monitoring reveals dissolved oxygen dynamics in an Antarctic cryoconite hole	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study presents the first high-resolution dataset of dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements in an ice-lidded cryoconite hole on Canada Glacier, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Fibre optic DO minisensors were installed in a cryoconite hole prior to seasonal internal melting and hydrological connection to the subsurface drainage system. Oxygen air saturation in the cryoconite hole typically ranged from 50 to 80%, in broad agreement with previous single measurements, indicating net respiration (R). This is consistent with results of simple incubation experiments performed in the field. Simultaneous time series for electrical conductivity, water temperature, and DO over the four-week study period provide information regarding the connectivity of cryoconite holes with the near-surface drainage system. The main driver of the observed variations in DO is likely to be periodic melt-freeze cycles. We conclude that automated sensing techniques, such as those described here, when used in conjunction with physical measurements, have great potential for high-resolution monitoring of the factors that perturb biogeochemical processes in cryospheric surface aquatic ecosystems.

Lakes and reservoirs are often effective N and P sinks, but the variability of their biogeochemical dynamics is still poorly documented, particularly in tropical systems. To contribute to the extending of information on tropical reservoirs and to increase the insight on the factors affecting N and P cycling in aquatic ecosystems, we here report on a long-term N and P mass balance (2003-2018) in Valle de Bravo, Mexico, which showed that this tropical eutrophic reservoir lake acts as a net sink of N (-41.7 g N m(-2) y(-1)) and P (-2.7 g P m(-2) y(-1)), mainly occurring through net sedimentation, equivalent to 181% and 68% of their respective loading (23.0 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 4.2 g P m(-2) y(-1)). The N mass balance also showed that the Valle de Bravo reservoir has a high net N atmospheric influx (31.6 g N m(-2) y(-1)), which was 1.3 times the external load and likely dominated by N-2 fixation. P flux was driven mainly by external load, while in the case of N, net fixation also contributed. During a period of high water level fluctuations, the net N atmospheric flux decreased by 50% compared to high level years. Our results outlining water regulation can be used as a useful management tool of water bodies, by decreasing anoxic conditions and net atmospheric fluxes, either through decreasing nitrogen fixation and/or promoting denitrification and other microbial processes that alleviate the N load. These findings also sustain the usefulness of long-term mass balances to assess biogeochemical dynamics and its variability.

However, farming faces many challenges: shorter growing seasons, severe weather conditions, climate change, and limited services and economic support. Lakehead University Agricultural Research Station (LUARS) is continuously working toward improving farming in Northern Ontario and testing different agricultural initiatives. Precision agriculture (PA) is one of the strategic means to improve Northern Ontario farming and sustain agricultural operations. Hence, PA requires accurate and up-to-date baseline information; the aim of this study is to develop baseline spatial information (land cover and soil pH variability maps) for the LUARS using remote sensing technology. A set of aerial images were acquired from the remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) and created an orthophoto (7-cm spatial resolution). A detailed land cover map was produced using a deep learning algorithm. We collected soil samples from three different sections (plots) of the area to analyze soil pH variations. Different geostatistical methods [ordinary kriging, Simple kriging, and empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK)] and deterministic interpolation techniques: local polynomial interpolation (LPI) and inverse distance weighted (IDW) were tested to map the spatial distribution of soil pH. A land cover classification achieved an overall accuracy of 73% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.70. Most of the homogeneous agricultural plots indicated higher producer's and user's classification accuracies. There was no linear correlation between soil sample data and vegetation indices derived from RPAS images to test the linear regression for soil pH mapping. EBK, LPI, and IDW produced soil pH maps with higher accuracies for Secs. 1-3, respectively.

Microcrustacean (Cladocera and Copepoda) Assemblages of a Tropical Karst Lake District	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The taxonomic richness, composition, abundance, and biomass of pelagic microcrustaceans (Cladocera and Copepoda) were determined in 17 lakes of the "Lagunas de Montebello" National Park, a karst lake district in Chiapas State, southeast Mexico. The selected aquatic bodies exemplify the lake diversity in the area, which displays an anthropic impact gradient from impacted/eutrophic lakes on the NW to non-impacted/oligotrophic lakes on the SE. Sampling was conducted in two contrasting climatic periods: warm-rainy and cold-dry seasons. There were 32 taxa, five calanoid copepods, 16 cyclopoid copepods, and 11 cladocerans. The highest taxonomic richness, abundance, and biomass were found in the impacted/eutrophic lakes and the lowest in the non-impacted/oligotrophic lakes. Nauplii and copepods were the most abundant, while the copepods provided the largest biomass. Small-sized individuals composed the most significant abundance and biomass in impacted/eutrophic lakes, while large-sized individuals in the non-impacted/oligotrophic lakes. Even though the studied lakes belong to the same lake district, they showed low taxonomic similarity. Not a single taxon was found in all lakes; the most distributed taxa (13-14 lakes) were Mastigodiaptomus nesus and Leptodiaptomus cuauhtemoci, while 15 taxa (47%) were found in only 1-3 lakes. This karst lake district showed a great regional microcrustacean taxonomic richness but a great singularity level in each lake.

Distribution and incidence of the oil palm weevil Rhynchophorus phoenicis (Fabricius, 1801) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in selected agro-ecological zones of Uganda	AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY												The genus Rhynchophorus (Herbst 1795) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a key pest of palms worldwide, but information on Rhynchophorus spp. attacking the oil palm, Elaeis guineensis Jaquin in Uganda is outdated. This study was carried out to establish the diversity, distribution and incidence of Rhynchophorus spp. on E. guineensis at three pmduction set-ups namely large-scale plantations, adaptive trials and small-scale farms in three (Lake Victoria Crescent, Lake Albert Crescent and Western Highlands) agro-ecological zones in Uganda; and to establish the effect of vicinity to natural vegetation on incidence of the pest. Two surveys were conducted in 2018 during the dry and wet seasons. Oil palm trees in each study site were scored as infested (1) or not infested (0) with Rhynchophorus spp. Heavily infested oil palms were sampled to collect weevils for morphological identification and were found to be of only one species, Rhynchophorus phoenicis (Fabricius, 1801). Incidence of R. phoenicis was compared across sampling sites, season and proximity to natural vegetation; and subjected to a multiple linear regression with temperature, relative humidity and rainfall. Incidence of R. phoenicis was highest in Masaka district in the western side of River Nile in Lake Victoria Crescent agro-ecological zone; and absent in Mayuge and Bugiri district at the eastern side of River Nile in Lake Victoria Crescent agro-ecological zone. The pest incidence was higher in the wet than the dry season; and in fields far away from natural vegetation than those that were nearer. Mean incidence of R. phoenicis did not correlate with temperature, relative humidity and rainfall. These findings offer clues of factors to consider in designing strategies for managing R. phoenicis in Uganda.

Pan coefficients for estimating open-water surface evaporation for a humid tropical monsoon climate region in India	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Pan coefficients have been developed for the Sukhna lake region in Chandigarh, India that has a humid tropical monsoon climate, using the optimisation technique for annual, monthly and seasonal time scales. Evaporation estimated using the Bowen ratio energy budget method has been considered as actual evaporation. Results show that the pan coefficient for the study area varies significantly both by month and season. The month-wise variation is in the range of 0.72-1.40 and the seasonal variation is in the range of 0.81-1.16. Pan coefficients obtained using various existing models such as Cuenca, Snyder, Modified Snyder, Pereira, Orang, FAO-56 and Wahed-Snyder have also been compared with the developed coefficients. Comparative analysis indicates that the pan coefficients obtained using the Snyder model overestimate evaporation significantly, while the rest of the models significantly underestimate evaporation. The study concludes that the developed pan coefficients are observed to estimate the open-water surface evaporation with a fair degree of accuracy for the study area while the pan coefficient value of 0.7 being used by most field organisations in India give high errors. However, since pan coefficients vary spatially due to the variation in the relative significance of various meteorological parameters, the pan coefficients developed in the present study need to be further evaluated for their suitability to other similar climatic regions of India.																			2347-4327	0973-774X				OCT	2019	128	7							175	10.1007/s12040-019-1198-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-019-1198-2													WOS:000472207200002

Based on Ortho Mosaic Image calibrated by UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), and 3D image map obtained by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and digital geometry, distribution of the trackways was identified. Occurrences of dinosaur tracks and sedimentary facies of the track-bearing deposits were described and the paleoenvironments were interpreted. The sauropod and ornithopod trackways represent their gregarious behavior. The theropod trackways show the characteristic of solitary behavior, whereas small theropod trackways discovered newly in this study show their gregarious behavior. The sedimentary facies of the track-hearing deposits are divided as follows: Interlaminated to thinly interbedded fine-grained sandstone to siltstone and mudstone; Bluish gray to light green calcareous sandy to silty mudstone; Light greenish gray muddy sandstone to sandy mudstone; Planar- to cross-laminated fine-grained sandstone to siltstone; Thin- to medium-bedded and graded medium- to fine-grained sandstone. They are interpreted as unconfined flow deposits formed on lake margin to shallow lake under paleoclimatic conditions with alternating wetting and drying intervals, and to have been intermittently influenced by pedogenesis. Mudcracks, wave ripples, small invertebrate trace fossils, weak pedogenesis and evaporite mineral casts are observed in the track-bearing deposits, suggesting that the paleoenvironments of the Sagok Formation at Sinseong-ri were lake margin (mudflat to sandflat) to shallow lake under seasonal climate in which arid climate prevailed and the lake was sometimes brackish during drying periods. It is interpreted that the Cretaceous lake and lake margin at Sinseong-ri provided a ecosite for diverse dinosaurs during arid condition.					; Choi, Taejin/AAI-4361-2020; Kim, Hyun/D-5568-2011; Lim, Hyoun/AAC-5499-2022	Lim, Hyoun Soo/0000-0002-2489-4470; Kim, Hyun Joo/0000-0002-5166-040X; Choi, Taejin/0000-0002-6680-5018													0435-4036	2288-7377				OCT	2019	55	5					495	511		10.14770/jgsk.2019.55.5.495	http://dx.doi.org/10.14770/jgsk.2019.55.5.495													WOS:000497963300001

A comprehensive study of the vegetation in Taitemar Lake from 2000 to 2017 was conducted, to determine differences between the overflow and the non-overflow areas, which were monitored along belt transects. There are some conclusions: (1) the ecological benefits of Taitemar Lake gradually emerged with increased water transfer: in the overflow area, the number of species per unit area, vegetation cover, and vegetation density were 6.8 species per 100 m(2), 30%, and 1350 per 100 m(2), respectively, while the three indices above in the non-overflow area were 1.7 species per 100 m(2), 7.0%, and 27.0 per 100 m(2), respectively. (2) In recent decades, the major changes in Taitemar Lake were as follows: in the early stage of water transport (2000-2006), the surface vegetation was dominated by newly germinated annual herbs (important value (IV) 0.50), followed by perennial herbs (IV 0.20), and finally shrubs (IV 0.10). After a few years, in 2008, the annual herbs almost disappeared in the overflow are and were replaced by shrubs and perennial herbs. Shrubs were the newly germinating seedlings of native species, and perennial herbs were dominated by Phragmites australis. From 2012 to 2016, under the abundant water conditions, the dominant species composition tended to be simple and the local vegetation developed in the direction of a saline meadow. (3) From 2011 to 2017, P. australis became the dominant species on the shoreline with the Simpson and Shannon indices remaining at low levels.

J	Sommaruga, R; Augustin, G				Sommaruga, Ruben; Augustin, Guenther			Seasonality in UV transparency of an alpine lake is associated to changes in phytoplankton biomass	AQUATIC SCIENCES												We studied the temporal variation in ultraviolet (UV) radiation transparency in the water column of a low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) lake (range: 0.12-0.65 mg L-1) located above the treeline. After ice-break, the water column was spatially segregated into an upper zone (0-4 m depth) with relatively constant UV transparency and a lower zone (4-9 m depth) where transparency decreased over time, for example at 380 nm, by up to 70%. This temporal decrease in UV transparency was significantly correlated with the increase in phytoplankton chlorophyll a. For the entire study period, there was no clear relationship between changes in UV transparency and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorptivity. Furthermore, changes in DOC concentration were not reflected in CDOM absorptivity or fluorescence, indicating a discrepancy between estimates of concentration and optical properties of this material. Use of spectral slope to track signals of CDOM photobleaching resulted in no consistent pattern. An indication of the low proportion of UV-absorbing chromophores in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool was obtained by applying size-exclusion chromatography combined with simultaneous measurements of DOC and UV absorption. These results indicated that more than the 50% of the DOM did not have significant UV absorption. Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of DOM also showed a low diversity of organic compounds which exhibited relatively low molecular weight (< 250 D). These results, in combination with measurements of DOC-specific absorptivity and fluorescence, indicated that DOM in this lake is mainly autochthonous. Overall, our results show that factors which have been established to explain temporal changes in UV transparency of high DOC lakes may have little application in this and similar alpine lakes. Finally, reconstruction of the UV-exposure history in alpine lakes may have to take into account the discrepancy between DOC and CDOM.

Near real-time sea surface temperature (SST) images derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) provide indices of upwelling events, but visual inspection of daily images can be tedious. Moreover, the definition, of what constitutes an upwelling from AVHRR data is subjective. We developed a semi-automated method to classify upwellings during the period of thermal stratification using daily, cloud-free surface for temperature charts from AVHRR SST data. Then we statistically evaluated the location, frequency, magnitude extent, and duration of upwelling events in Lake Michigan from 1992-2000. Further, we analyzed meteorological data from the National Data Buoy Center buoys in an attempt to improve the reliability of the classification and to provide a means for future forecast of coastal upwelling. Although variable, upwelling events along the western shoreline were preceded by 4 days of southerly and west-to-north-westerly winds, while upwelling events occurring along the eastern shore were preceded by 4 days of northerly winds. Probability of an upwelling event occuring was a function of the direction-weighted wind speed, reaching 100% probability at direction weighted wind speeds of 11 m s(-1) for the western shore. Probability of an upwelling occurrence along the east coast reached 73% at 11 m s(-1) and 100% at 13 m s(-1). Continuous measurements of wind data with a sufficient temporal resolution are required during the entire upwelling season to improve the predictability of upwellings.					; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020	Rutherford, Edward/0000-0002-7282-6667; Mason, Doran/0000-0002-6017-4243; Plattner, Stefan/0000-0001-5185-5437													0380-1330						2006	32	1					63	76		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[63:CAFCUI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[63:CAFCUI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236636000006

Reconstructions of precipitation isotopic compositions have emerged as a powerful tool to reconstruct rainfall amount in many tropical regions, yet it has proven difficult to reconcile precipitation isotope records from the IPWP with records of widespread drying. To evaluate the signals preserved in precipitation isotope records, we produced new hydrogen and carbon isotope records from Lake Towuti and Lake Matano in Sulawesi, Indonesia using long-chain n-alkanes. We then compared these new records to existing n-alkanoic acid records from the same lakes and compiled available marine runoff, salinity, leaf wax hydrogen isotope (delta H-2(wax)), and leaf wax carbon isotope (delta C-13(wax)) records in the IPWP. During the last deglaciation, marine runoff and salinity proxies reveal that precipitation amount began to increase dramatically between similar to 12.3 ka at the end of the Younger Dryas. A principal component analysis of precipitation isotope records indicates a shift from more H-2-enriched to H-2-depleted waxes at similar to 12.3 ka as sea level rise inundates most of the Sunda and Sahul shelves, coincident with runoff and salinity proxies, suggesting precipitation isotopes respond strongly to rainfall amount in this region. Over 70% of IPWP delta C-13(wax) records show a transition from more to less C-13-enriched waxes beginning about 19.9 ka, prior to the reconstructed increases in precipitation. We suggest that vegetation shifted in response to the changing seasonality of precipitation. The dramatic changes in the IPWP during the last deglaciation highlight the capacity for the region to experience dynamic changes in precipitation, vegetation, and atmospheric circulation.					; He, Chengfei/AAX-5695-2021; Du, Xiaojing/GPF-6312-2022; Bijaksana, Satria/I-4683-2013; Vogel, Hendrik/C-6148-2014	Du, Xiaojing/0000-0001-9709-0732; Parish, Meredith/0000-0001-7159-3358; Vogel, Hendrik/0000-0002-9902-8120													0277-3791	1873-457X				JUL 15	2024	336								108755	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108755		JUN 2024											WOS:001301692600001

The study was led by specific objectives, specifically: assessing the effects of flooding on agricultural productivity, and smallholder farmer's responses to rainfall variability for the past 20-30 years, investigating climate-smart water management practices for sustainable agriculture, and analyzing the seasonal variations of the physicochemical water quality parameters. The study used a mixed research design, which used mixed methodologies to collect and analyze data using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. A straightforward random sampling approach was used to determine the sample size. Three hundred and ninety-seven respondents participated in the study. Quantitative data was analyzed using the R programming language, and qualitative data was analyzed using ATLAS.ti. The study identified climate-smart water management practices like mulching, terracing, contour farming, conservation tillage, agroforestry, and fertilizer management. Most of the respondents (29.7%) cited a reduction in soil fertility. 57.9% of the total sampled respondents had noticed changes in rainfall variability, and 67.3% reported a decrease in rainfall. The majority (38% of the participants) use mulching to reduce running water into the catchment areas. Turbidity, temperature, and DO were beyond the WHO-permitted levels.

Using trait-based approaches to study phytoplankton seasonal succession in a subtropical reservoir in arid central western Argentina	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The application of trait-based approaches has become a widely applied tool to analyse community assembly processes and dynamics in phytoplankton communities. Its advantages include summarizing information of many species without losing essentials of the main driving processes. Here, we used trait-based approaches to study phytoplankton temporal succession in a subtropical reservoir. We applied a combined approach including morphological traits (i.e. volume, surface) and functional clustering of species (morphology-based functional groups (MBFG) and Reynolds' groups) and related the clustering of species with the environment. We found that this reservoir is characterized by a low richness and a bimodal distribution of phytoplankton biomass. Taxonomic and functional classifications were coincident, and the dominant species and groups biomasses were explained by the same group of variables. For instance, group X-2, MBFG V and Carteria sp. biomasses were explained by: pH, Secchi disk depth, N-NH4; while group B, MBFG VI and Cyclotella ocellata biomasses were explained by stability of the water column, incident solar radiation, Secchi disk depth and N-NH4. From our results, we state that functional and taxonomic classifications are complementary rather than opposed approaches, and their specific uses depend exclusively on the aim of the study and the characteristics of the environment under evaluation. Our work is the first description of phytoplankton dynamics in a reservoir in the arid central western Argentina (Cuyo region).

Biochemical composition of the ovarian fluid and its effects on the fertilization capacity of turbot Scophthalmus maximus during the spawning season	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study investigated the biochemical composition of ovarian fluid and its effect on the fertilization capacity of turbot Scophthalmus maximus during the spawning season. The fertilization rate and pH of ovarian fluid varied throughout the spawning season, with the highest values recorded at the mid-season. Positive correlations were found between the fertilization rate and the ovarian fluid pH. The composition of major inorganic ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl-) showed no significant changes during the spawning season. Alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity was significantly higher during mid-season than other seasons. The lowest levels of protein, acid phosphatase (ACP) and aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) were in the ovarian fluid released at the mid-season. Moreover, significant relationships were observed between the fertilization rate and the levels of protein, ACP, AKP and AAT. These observations suggest that the biochemical profile of ovarian fluid affects the insemination microenvironment as well as the fertilization capacity of S. maximus eggs. Determination of such profiles may prove to be a useful strategy to improve S. maximus breeding techniques.

Selection of climate information for regional climate change assessments using regionalization techniques: an example for the Upper Great Lakes Region, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Climate change assessments often utilize only a small number of climate stations within the assessment region. Consequently, the selection of representative stations that capture the spatial variability of climate is an essential first step of the assessment. Furthermore, climate observations and scenarios frequently need to be linked with other (e.g. agricultural, biological, socioeconomic) datasets available at varying spatial resolutions in order to assess regional-scale impacts and vulnerability. This study illustrates the utility of well-known objective climate classification techniques in facilitating regional-scale climate change assessments, using the Upper Great Lakes region (UGLR) of the United States as an example. A combination of principal components analysis and cluster analysis was employed to group climate stations from the US Historical Climatology Network into a small number of climate regions. The regionalization initially was performed on long-term averages of monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation for 1971-2000, and then applied to two earlier time periods (1911-1940 and 1941-1970) to assess the sensitivity of the regionalization to the development period. The spatial variability of average monthly temperature and precipitation in the UGLR was found to be effectively represented by seven climate types. Potential applications of the regionalization for climate change assessments are illustrated. First, Euclidean distance, employed within a geographic information system (ArcGIS), provided a convenient means of assigning political units (counties) within the UGLR to the climate regions to facilitate the integration of point-scale climate information with spatially-aggregated datasets. Second, a minimum number of climate stations for an assessment were selected based on the climate regionalization. Finally, the regionalization was used to evaluate the spatial representativeness of a subset of climate stations that were initially chosen based on the completeness of daily observations.																			0899-8418	1097-0088				MAY	2015	35	6					1027	1040		10.1002/joc.4036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.4036													WOS:000353987800018

Currently however, the situation is under severe pressure due to several stressors that have a clear impact on access to water. In the Arctic, climate change is having an impact on water availability by melting glaciers, decreasing seasonal rates of precipitation, increasing evapotranspiration, and drying lakes and rivers existing in permafrost grounds. Water quality is also being impacted as manmade pollutants stored in the environment are released, lowland areas are flooded with salty ocean water during storms, turbidity from permafrost-driven thaw and erosion is increased, and the growth or emergence of natural pollutants are increased. By 2030 it is estimated that the world will need to produce 50% more food and energy which means a continuous increase in demand for water. Decisionmakers will have to very clearly include life quality aspects of future generations in the work as impact of ongoing changes will be noticeable, in many cases, in the future. This article will focus on effects of climate-change on water security with an Arctic perspective giving some examples from different countries how arising problems are being addressed.

Studies that document the complex stratigraphy and architecture of high-latitude alluvial systems deposited under greenhouse conditions are extremely rare. It is exceptionally uncommon to find extensive, accessible outcrops that also contain numerous Arctic dinosaur fossils; hence the Prince Creek Formation is of great significance not only to sedimentologists but also to paleontologists involved in reconstructing high-latitude dinosaur habitats. Maastrichtian strata of the Prince Creek Formation record deposition on a tidally influenced high-latitude coastal-plain in (i) first-order meandering trunk channels, (ii) second-order meandering distributary channels, (iii) third-order fixed (anastomosed?) distributary channels, and (iv) on floodplains. Conglomerate and medium- to coarse-grained multistory sandbodies are found exclusively in regionally restricted 13-17-m-thick fining-upward successions (FUSs) that display inclined heterolithic stratification (IHS) capped by finer-grained, organic-rich facies. These relatively thick FUSs are interpreted as first-order meandering trunk channels. Thinner (2-6-m thick), single-story, heterolithic sheet sandbodies composed predominantly of IHS and including abundant mud-filled channel plugs are the most frequently encountered channel form. Trough cross-lamination at the base of the HIS records paleoflow at high angles relative to the dip of the inclined beds, indicating that lateral accretion of point-bars was the principal depositional mechanism. These single-story sandbodies are interpreted as second-order meandering distributary channels. Fine-grained, 1.5-3.0-m-thick, ripple cross-laminated ribbon sandbodies deposited mainly by vertical accretion above an arcuate erosion surface and containing only minor IHS are interpreted as third-order fixed (anastomosed?) distributary channels. Thinner (0.2-1.0-m-thick) current-rippled sheet sands and silts are interpreted as small-scale crevasse splays and levees. Organic-rich siltstone and mudstone, carbonaceous shale, coal, bentonite, and tuff are interpreted as deposits of lakes, ponds, swamps, marshes, mires, paleosols, and ashfall on floodplains. Heterolithic sheet sandstones deposited by small, sinuous meandering distributary channels typically appear lenticular along strike, commonly incise into pre-existing distributary channels, and interfinger with and incise into organic-rich floodplain facies. Fixed, ribbon-form (anastomosed?) distributaries incise either into meandering distributaries or into floodplain facies, with numerous ribbons typically preserved in tiers at the same stratigraphic level. Spatial relationships between channel types, and between channels and floodplain facies, indicate that the bulk of deposition took place on crevasse-splay complexes adjacent to trunk channels. Crevasse-splay complexes were constructed by the lateral migration of sinuous meandering distributaries and the vertical filling of fixed (anastomosed?) distributaries, with splay complexes separated from each other by organic floodplain facies. Flow in meandering distributaries and fixed (anastomosed?) distributaries may have been contemporaneous. Alternatively, fixed (anastomosed?) distributaries may record the initial or waning stages of flow during splay-complex formation or abandonment. IHS composed of rhythmically repeating, coarse-to-fine couplets of current-rippled sandstone and siltstone or mudstone is found in all three types of channels. The rhythmic and repetitive nature of these couplets together with relatively thick, muddy fine-grained members in couplets suggest that flow in channels was likely influenced by tidal effects. Drab colors in fine-grained sediments, abundant carbonaceous plant material, and common siderite nodules and jarosite suggest widespread reducing conditions on poorly drained floodplains influenced, in more distal areas, by marine waters. However, carbonaceous root traces found ubiquitously in all distributary channels and most floodplain facies along with common Fe-oxide mottles indicate that the alluvial system likely experienced flashy, seasonal, or ephemeral flow, and a fluctuating water table. The flashy nature of the alluvial system may have been driven by recurring episodes of vigorous seasonal snowmelt in the Brooks Range orogenic belt as a consequence of the high paleolatitude of northern Alaska in the Late Cretaceous.

Landscape-scale control of carbon budget of Lake Simcoe: A process-based modelling approach	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We present an application of the Integrated Catchments model for Carbon (INCA-C) to simulate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in two main tributaries of Lake Simcoe. This is the first application of the INCA-C model to a large watershed with mixed agricultural, urban and forest land use. Understanding DOC dynamics in the Lake Simcoe watershed will aid in understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of organic and metal contaminant transport in the watershed which should, in turn, lead to improved watershed management. We were able to successfully simulate flows in the Beaver River and to capture the seasonal and inter-annual patterns in DOC concentration in the Beaver and White Creeks, two of Lake Simcoe's major tributaries. Sensitivity analysis showed the importance of hydrology and land use in controlling surface water DOC. The success of the model application presented here suggests that some of the same processes which control DOC in headwater watersheds are also operating in larger river basins.

Preliminary Evaluation of a Large-Scale American Eel Conservation Stocking Experiment	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Significant declines in the recruitment of American eels Anguilla rostrata to formerly productive habitats in the upper St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario resulted in the implementation of an experimental conservation stocking program. Nearly 3.8 million American eels (glass eel and elver stages) were stocked during 2006-2009. Our study objectives were to (1) assess the adequacy of sampling procedures for following temporal changes in stocked eel abundance, (2) examine captured eels for evidence of spinal trauma, (3) qualitatively evaluate whether stocked eels would disperse outside of stocking locations, and (4) provide initial data on biological variables describing young stocked yellow eels. Boat electrofishing was successful at capturing all four stocked year-classes, and the densities of stocked eels in the main stocking locations ranged from 25 to 275 eels/ha. Estimated sampling precision ranged from 0.15 to 0.28, and the estimated sample sizes required to detect a 50% change in stocked eel densities ranged from 27 to 112 electrofishing transects depending on location and season. The stocked American eels dispersed throughout Lake Ontario and demonstrated among the fastest recorded growth rates for this species: 60 to 123 mm/year. The first male American eels ever identified in the St. Lawrence River watershed were among the stocked individuals assessed for gender. We conclude that boat electrofishing for yellow American eels has the potential to measure stocking effectiveness along shallow shorelines with limited aquatic vegetation. We also recognize that the ultimate assessment of the conservation stocking experiment will not be made until future studies on the population demographics, migratory behavior, and spawning physiology of stocked American eels are complete.

Although beach monitoring is crucial to estimating nesting population size and activity, in-water data are essential for understanding population dynamics, evaluating management strategies, and ensuring the species' continued recovery. Fifteen immature and 7 adult female ridleys were fitted with platform terminal transmitters and released off the upper Texas coast during 2004 through 2007. Immature individuals were tracked primarily during warmer months and exhibited preferences for tidal passes, bays, coastal lakes, and nearshore waters, although movement patterns varied among years. Females tracked during their inter-nesting intervals remained in the vicinity of the upper Texas coast and, upon entering the post-nesting stage, moved eastward along the 20 m isobath to foraging areas offshore of central Louisiana. Satellite telemetry indicated that inshore and continental shelf waters of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico serve as developmental, migratory, inter-nesting, and post-nesting habitat for the Kemp's ridley. Projected population growth will likely lead to increased use of the northwestern Gulf by the species and more frequent encounters with human activities. The extent of such anthropogenic interactions and need for mitigation measures should be examined and considered by natural resource managers to facilitate continued recovery of this and other sea turtle species in the Gulf of Mexico. Likewise, research efforts should be continued to better understand seasonal in-water distributions, abundances, population dynamics, and mortality risks to all life history stages.

Life-cycle evaluation of nitrogen-use in rice-farming systems: implications for economically-optimal nitrogen rates	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Nitrogen (N) fertilizer plays an important role in agricultural systems in terms of food yield. However, N application rates (NARs) are often overestimated over the rice (Oryza sativa L.) growing season in the Taihu Lake region of China. This is largely because negative externalities are not entirely included when evaluating economically-optimal nitrogen rate (EONR), such as only individual N losses are taken into account, or the inventory flows of reactive N have been limited solely to the farming process when evaluating environmental and economic effects of N fertilizer. This study integrates important material and energy flows resulting from N use into a rice agricultural inventory that constitutes the hub of the life-cycle assessment (LCA) method. An economic evaluation is used to determine an environmental and economic NAR for the Taihu Lake region. The analysis reveals that production and exploitation processes consume the largest proportion of resources, accounting for 77.2% and 22.3% of total resources, respectively. Regarding environmental impact, global warming creates the highest cost with contributions stemming mostly from fertilizer production and farming processes. Farming process incurs the biggest environmental impact of the three environmental impact categories considered, whereas transportation has a much smaller effect. When taking account of resource consumption and environmental cost, the marginal benefit of 1 kg rice would decrease from 2.4 to only 1.05 yuan. Accordingly, our current EONR has been evaluated at 187 kgNha(-1) for a single rice-growing season. This could enhance profitability, as well as reduce the N losses associated with rice growing.					yan, xiao yuan/M-9840-2016; XIA, Yongqiu/D-6236-2017; Yan, Xiaoyuan/M-9840-2016	yan, xiao yuan/0000-0001-8645-4836; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2011	8	11					3159	3168		10.5194/bg-8-3159-2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-8-3159-2011													WOS:000298132200005

Microbial communities in contrasting freshwater marsh microhabitats	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Heterotrophic microorganisms are widely recognized as crucial components of ecosystems; yet information on their community structure and dynamics in benthic freshwater habitats is notably scarce. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), we determined the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in a freshwater marsh over four seasons. DGGE revealed diverse bacterial communities in four contrasting microhabitats. The greatest compositional differences emerged between water-column and surface-associated bacteria, although communities associated with sediment also differed from those on plant litter and epiphytic biofilms. Sequences of bacterial clones derived from DGGE bands belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria (31%), Actinobacteria (19%) and Bacteriodetes (19%). Betaproteobacteria were notably absent. Fungal clones obtained from leaf litter were mainly Ascomycota, but two members of the Basidiomycota were also identified. Overall, habitat type was the most important factor explaining variation in bacterial communities among samples, whereas temporal patterns in community composition were less pronounced in spite of large seasonal variation in environmental conditions such as temperature. The observed differences among bacterial communities in different microhabitats were not caused by random variation, but rather appeared to be determined by habitat characteristics, as evidenced by largely congruent community profiles of replicate samples taken at 10-100 m distances within the marsh.					; Burgmann, Helmut/E-8804-2011	Burgmann, Helmut/0000-0002-5651-5906; 													0168-6496					JUL	2009	69	1					84	97		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00692.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00692.x								19496822					WOS:000266637200008

Elevated pH regulates bacterial carbon cycling in lakes with high photosynthetic activity	ECOLOGY												Bacteria are critically important for carbon (C) cycling and energy flow in aquatic environments. However, studies to date have largely focused on the role of substrate quality in the regulation of this important process. As such, we know little about the role of other ecological drivers in shaping bacterially mediated C cycling. Here we examine the manner in which planktonic bacterial abundance (BA), productivity (BP), respiration (BR), and growth efficiency (BGE), and thus C cycling are affected by elevated pH, an ecological factor that occurs commonly in highly productive aquatic systems. We undertook our study in lakes of the Mackenzie Delta region of Canada. These lakes routinely experience high pH caused by rapid macrophyte photosynthesis. Two different experiment types were employed: first, a series of short-term experiments was used to assess the direct effects of elevated pH on bacteria experiencing differing pH levels in situ. Second, long-term mesocosms were used to explore the effect of elevated pH on bacteria over longer time scales and in the presence of other trophic levels. Bacterial productivity and BR slowed dramatically with elevated pH over the short term, potentially uncoupling bacterial processing of organic matter from its in-lake production and causing a switch away from biomass creation and toward C mineralization. With longer term exposure, bacterial communities adapted to the direct stress of elevated pH, but responses at higher trophic levels caused a cascade that mediated the effect of alkalization on bacteria, in a manner that could well vary among aquatic ecosystems. Our study establishes elevated pH as a key driver of bacterial C cycling and energy flow in aquatic systems with high autotrophic productivity.

We conducted high vertical resolution (2 m interval) monitoring at similar to monthly intervals over a year for hydrological parameters, Chl-a, ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-) and different species of phosphorus (P) and manganese (Mn) in a 40-meter-deep subtropical reservoir (Shanmei Reservoir) in Fujian, southern China. In this seasonally stratified reservoir featured with high nutrient loading, the consistent trend in the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) between the euphotic zone and the hypolimnion, coupled with its mirrored correlation with Chl-a concentration indicates that upward flux from the hypolimnion affects phytoplankton growth in the euphotic zone. The monthly variation of the depth-integrated multiple species of N and P indicates that during the stratification period in the hypoxic hypolimnion, approximately 80% of the DIP is removed, leading to a remarkable decoupling phenomenon between NH4+ and DIP. This process effectively increases the ratio of DIN to DIP in the hypolimnion, thereby significantly reducing the potential of algal blooms caused by the upward flux. A robust positive linear correlation between iron-manganese bound phosphorus (CBD-P) and particulate Mn was observed during stratification period implying that DIP was scavenged by sediment-released Mn throughout the water column. Vertical profiles during stratification showed that upward diffusion of Mn2+ facilitated the formation of Mn oxide zones near the oxycline. The most significant decrease in DIP inventory occurs when Mn oxide zones migrate either upwards from the bottom or downwards from the oxycline, indicating that the migration of Mn oxides on the vertical profile is a key factor in the decoupling of NH(4)(+)and DIP. Our findings underscore the importance of Mn cycling as an underappreciated DIP self-immobilization process in the water column of reservoirs characterized by high nutrient loading. Furthermore, we propose that denitrification and Mn cycling establish a consecutive feedback mechanism, preventing excessive nutrient accumulation in low oxygen bottom water. In the context of global changes, we anticipate a heightened prominence of this feedback mechanism.

N. erebi diets reflected strong 'boom and bust' patterns of food consumption, with high concentrations of benthic (non-filamentous) algae during boom (flow) times, moving to higher concentrations of filamentous algae and detritus during bust (no flow) periods. M. ambigua diets were primarily dominated by aquatic insects in all sampling periods. Although there was no clear 'boom to bust' pattern in relation to flow, M. ambigua secondary prey consumption revealed a compensatory switch between high energy prey (crustaceans) during more productive periods with terrestrial insects during less productive periods. The ability of both species of fish to switch from high to low concentrations of food quality under a variable environmental background allows them to persist through both high productive and low productive periods. This interaction between native biota and variable 'boom' and 'bust' conditions, and how changes to the natural hydrology will affect it is an important consideration of any future water resource development plans.

Physical Factors and Microbubble Formation Explain Differences in CH4 Dynamics Between Shallow Lakes Under Alternative States	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Submerged macrophytes play a key role in maintaining clear vegetated states in shallow lakes, but their role on methane (CH4) dynamics is less explored. They might enhance methanogenesis by providing organic matter but they can also supply oxygen to the sediments increasing methanotrophy. They may also affect gas exchange by diminishing wind turbulence in the water column. We previously measured seasonal CO2 and CH4 partial pressure (pCO(2) and pCH(4)) and diffusive fluxes from two clear vegetated and two turbid algal shallow lakes of the Pampean Plain, Argentina, and we reported that clear lakes had higher mean annual pCH(4) despite states having similar mean annual CH4 diffusive flux. In this study we explore the contribution of physical and biological factors regulating surface pCH(4). Mean annual CH4 diffusive fluxes and CH4 fraction of oxidation (F-ox) were similar between states, implying a comparable mean annual CH4 input. kCH(4) was significantly higher than kCO(2,) suggesting occurrence of CH4 microbubbles, yet kCH(4) was higher in turbid lakes than in clear lakes, implying a higher microbubble formation in turbid lakes. Furthermore, in turbid lakes there were positive relationships between k and wind speed, and between k and pCH(4), yet in clear lakes these relations were absent. Results suggest that submerged vegetation suppresses wind induced turbulence in clear vegetated lakes, decoupling kCH(4) from wind and reducing microbubble formation, therefore augmenting pCH(4) in their surface waters. Overall, physical rather than biological factors appear to control the observed differences in pCH(4) between states.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Sánchez, María Laura/AAZ-1382-2021; Baliña, Sofia/IQR-8280-2023	Sanchez, Maria Laura/0000-0001-5831-1811; 														2296-665X				JUN 23	2022	10								892339	10.3389/fenvs.2022.892339	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.892339													WOS:000821807300001

Distribution of seston and nutrient concentrations in the eastern basin of Lake Erie pre- and post-dreissenid mussel invasion	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Increased human population growth, reduction of phosphorus (P) loading, and the invasion of dreissenid mussels may have changed the spatial pattern and relationships between the nearshore and the offshore seston and nutrient concentrations in the eastern basin of lake Erie over the past 30 years. We compared seston characteristics, nutrient concentrations, and phytoplankton nutrient status between nearshore and offshore zones in years before (1973-1985) and after (1990-2003) the dreissenid invasion. In 1973 (the only pre-dreissenid year nearshore data was collected), chlorophyll a (chla) and nutrient concentrations were higher nearshore than offshore. In post-dreissenid years, nearshore chla concentrations became significantly lower than the offshore, while carbon (C):chla ratios became higher, which was related to mussel grazing and possibly photoacclimation. Phosphorus deficiency in the phytoplankton increased over the 30-year period, and in the post-dreissenid years was less acute in the nearshore than offshore. Mean water column irradiance became higher in the nearshore relative to the offshore in the post-dreissenid years. The nutrient changes and phytoplankton physiology were consistent with the expected effects of nutrient cycling by mussels and diminished demand by phytoplankton despite increased demand from benthic algae in the nearshore. This basin-scale study suggests that dreissenid mussel invasion can be associated with alterations in the spatial pattern of water column properties in large lakes even on open coasts with vigorous circulation and exchange.

Phytoplankton versus macrophyte contribution to primary production and biogeochemical cycles of a coastal mesotidal system. A modelling approach	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study presents an assessment of the contributions of various primary producers to the global annual production and N/P cycles of a coastal system, namely the Arcachon Bay, by means of a numerical model. This 3D model fully couples hydrodynamic with ecological processes and simulates nitrogen, silicon and phosphorus cycles as well as phytoplankton, macroalgae and seagrasses. Total annual production rates for the different components were calculated for different years (2005, 2007 and 2009) during a time period of drastic reduction in seagrass beds since 2005. The total demand of nitrogen and phosphorus was also calculated and discussed with regards to the riverine inputs. Moreover, this study presents the first estimation of particulate organic carbon export to the adjacent open ocean. The calculated annual net production for the Arcachon Bay (except microphytobenthos, not included in the model) ranges between 22,850 and 35,300 tons of carbon. The main producers are seagrasses in all the years considered with a contribution ranging from 56% to 81% of global production. According to our model, the -30% reduction in seagrass bed surface between 2005 and 2007, led to an approximate 55% reduction in seagrass production, while during the same period of time, macroalgae and phytoplankton enhanced their productions by about +83% and +46% respectively. Nonetheless, the phytoplankton production remains about eightfold higher than the macroalgae production. Our results also highlight the importance of remineralisation inside the Bay, since riverine inputs only fulfill at maximum 73% nitrogen and 13% phosphorus demands during the years 2005, 2007 and 2009. Calculated advection allowed a rough estimate of the organic matter export: about 10% of the total production in the bay was exported, originating mainly from the seagrass compartment, since most of the labile organic matter was remineralised inside the bay.

Introduction of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, may cause a cascade of alterations in trophic webs, among other negative effects, indirectly due to its feeding behaviour. A simplified model site, covenient for studying such interrelations is Lago de Patzcuaro, Mexico, a shallow lake where carp was first introduced in 1974. The aim of our study was to characterize diet composition, diet breadth and trophic position of C. carpio and local fish fauna, and to assess diet overlap between fish fauna from sites with different habitat characteristics during the wet and the dry seasons. Materials and methods. We assessed the diet of C. carpio and local fish fauna in six sites during the wet and the dry seasons. Stomach content analysis was carried out separately for each length class. The importance of each item was estimated by the index of relative importance (IRI) and the omnivory index was used to assess the feeding behaviour. The trophic guild and trophic position were determined using the TrophLab software and stable isotope analysis. Diet breadth was calculated by Levin's Index and diet overlap by the Horn's Index. Fish dorsal muscle and water hyacinth tissues were obtained from nitrogen isotope signature analysis. Results. We found that C. carpio is an omnivorous fish that feeds in shallow areas with water hyacinth cover and rooted macrophytes, consuming mainly detritus and plant debris (>60%). However, delta N-15 values indicate that C. carpio is also a secondary consumer because it also ingests invertebrates associated with plant debris. The carp diet overlaps with native blackfin, Goodea atripinnis Jordan, 1880, at most sites. Small carp (<120 mm SL) overlapped with the Chirostoma spp. diet, as well as the introduced Oreochromis spp. at shallower sites with surface water hyacinth and with plant detritus at the bottom. Conclusion. Lago de Patzcuaro is facing trophic food web reduction that seems to be a more serious problem than feeding competition between the common carp and other fish species.

A functional form of the bulk coefficient was determined from eddy correlation measurements at the central part of the lake. Wind speed (U), temperature, humidity, and infrared radiation surface temperature, from which the specific humidity qs of the water surface was determined, were also measured. Specific humidity q and U at 10 m above the surface of each grid were derived from routine measurements at meteorological stations in and around the lake, by applying the Kriging interpolation scheme. This operation produced not only the totals but also the horizontal variation in E. The mean annual E was estimated as 911 (+/- 42) mm, which is within the range of previous estimates of 671-1003 mm/yr. Seasonally, E followed the change in net radiation with a short (<1 month) phase delay caused by stored energy in the water body. Year-to-year variation was small. Horizontally E tended to be larger in the central and southern parts of the lake, reflecting stronger wind regime there.

Genetic mating system and mate selection in smallmouth bass	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Mating systems are an important factor influencing the variance in reproductive success among individuals within natural populations and thus have important ecological and evolutionary implications. We used molecular pedigree reconstruction techniques with microsatellite DNA data to characterize the genetic mating system and mate selection in adult smallmouth bass spawning in Lake Opeongo. The genetic mating system of smallmouth bass in this system can be characterized as predominantly monogamous with a low rate of polygynandry particularly among larger individuals. Iteroparous individuals showed a complete absence of interannual mate fidelity, presumably due to the low annual return rate of spawning adults. Within a season, individuals from both sexes pursued additional mating opportunities with males showing greater variance in mate number than females. Female mate selection appeared to be largely random with little evidence for elevated levels of inbreeding in this population. Multiple mating females pursued additional males to whom they were less related than the first male with which they spawned within a given season, however, this pattern varied among years. The mating pattern observed in this population would likely limit the strength of sexual selection and thus could account for the lack of sexual - dimorphism and the absence of alternative reproductive tactics in this species.

Bayesian variable selection of factors explaining fish movement distance	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Understanding fish movement patterns is vital for stock assessment and fishery management. We used a variable selection procedure in a Bayesian framework to understand what factors most likely affect the net movement distance of individual fish based on a conventional tag-recovery study of lake whitefish populations in Lake Huron during 2003-2011, where fish of this species with spawning site fidelity were tagged during the spawning season and recovered throughout the year. We found that fish with greater total length, and those that were tagged and released from tagging sites near Cheboygan and Alpena, Michigan, moved longer net distances than fish from other tagging sites. Habitat conditions also had a profound effect on net movement distance. We found that shorter movement distances by lake whitefish can be expected if the relative density of the benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. was higher near the tagging site during the recovery year. We also found evidence that lake whitefish may start their annual spawning migration runs earlier during wanner years. More generally, our Bayesian framework for analysis of conventional tagging data has potential for wide applicability, and model details and our code are provided to facilitate this.

This taxon forms relatively large populations in the phytoplankton of Lake Tuofengling Tianchi, a 33m-deep, oligotrophic, crater lake located in Inner Mongolia. In this paper, the valve morphology and ultrastructure of this taxon is described using light and scanning electron microscopy and a new name, Lindavia khinganensis sp. nov., is proposed. A discriminant analysis based on morphological LM and SEM data confirmed that L. khinganensis is distinct from other Lindavia species with a similar morphology such as L. comta (Ehrenberg) Nakov et al., L. radiosa (Grunow) De Toni & Forti, L. balatonis (Pantocsek) Nakov et al., L. praetermissa (Lund) Nakov et al. and L. tenuistriata (Hustedt) Nakov et al. In addition, the seasonal and interannual distribution of L. khinganensis was investigated using sediment trap samples collected over a two-year period.

The observed mean total As concentration in water (1.29 mu gl(-1)) during the wet and dry seasons did not exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value of 10 mu gl(-1). Among the examined biota, Tympanotonus fuscatus recorded higher As levels (2.31 +/- 0.24 mg kg(-1)) and Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus recorded the least As content (0.67 +/- 0.08 mg kg(-1)). A significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between As concentrations in fish muscles and water during the dry and wet seasons. The health risks associated with human consumption of fish estimated using Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) were lower than the USEPA guideline value of 1 for all fish species examined except in populations that consume larger amounts of fish. However, higher THQ values (>2) were obtained for Tympanotonus fuscatus, suggesting the potential for non-carcinogenic health outcomes in adults after a prolonged period of consumption.

Contribution of manipulable and non-manipulable environmental factors to trapping efficiency of invasive sea lamprey	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We identified aspects of the trapping process that afforded opportunities for improving trap efficiency of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in a Great Lake's tributary. Capturing a sea lamprey requires it to encounter the trap, enter, and be retained until removed. Probabilities of these events depend on the interplay between sea lamprey behavior, environmental conditions, and trap design. We first tested how strongly seasonal patterns in daily trap catches (a measure of trapping success) were related to nightly rates of trap encounter, entry, and retention (outcomes of sea lamprey behavior). We then tested the degree to which variation in rates of trap encounter, entry, and retention were related to environmental features that control agents can manipulate (attractant pheromone addition, discharge) and features agents cannot manipulate (water temperature, season), but could be used as indicators for when to increase trapping effort. Daily trap catch was most strongly associated with rate of encounter. Relative and absolute measures of predictive strength for environmental factors that managers could potentially manipulate were low, suggesting that opportunities to improve trapping success by manipulating factors that affect rates of encounter, entry, and retention are limited. According to results at this trap, more sea lamprey would be captured by increasing trapping effort early in the season when sea lamprey encounter rates with traps are high. The approach used in this study could be applied to trapping of other invasive or valued species. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the streamflow and water level complexity increases as the time-scale increases. The sample entropy of the streamflow increases when the time-scale increases from a daily to a seasonal scale, also the sample entropy of the water level increases when the time-scale increases from a daily to a monthly scale. The water outflows of Poyang Lake, which is impacted mainly by the inflow processes, lake regulation, and the streamflow processes of the Yangtze River, is more complex than the water inflows. The streamflow and water level complexity over most of the time-scales, between the daily and monthly scales, is dominated by the increasing trend. This indicates the enhanced randomness, disorderliness, and irregularity of the streamflows and water levels. This investigation can help provide a better understanding to the hydrological features of large freshwater lakes. Ongoing research will be made to analyze and understand the mechanisms of the streamflow and water level complexity changes within the context of climate change and anthropogenic activities.

Trace Metal Concentration in a Temperate Freshwater Reservoir Seasonally Subjected to Blooms of Toxin-Producing Cyanobacteria	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In situ interactions between cyanobacteria and metals were studied at Torro reservoir (TA cent mega River, North Portugal). The metal content of water and sediments from the reservoir was monitored monthly at Marco de Canaveses (seasonally subjected to toxic blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa) and upstream at Amarante (no blooms recorded), for 16 months. During the 16 months of the study period, M. aeruginosa bloomed twice at Marco de Canaveses, firstly forming a scum, and later with colonies scattered throughout the reservoir. Metals Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were analysed in the sediment and in the water column. Cu-binding ligands in water were also determined. When no blooms were taking place, average metal levels for water and sediment were not statistically different at both locations. Therefore, it was considered that the absence of cyanobacteria blooms at Amarante was not due to differences in metal content. When blooms were taking place at Marco de Canaveses, a significant increase of metal levels in the sediment occurred simultaneously. Sediment quality guidelines showed that during this period, Cu and Pb concentrations (32.3 and 43.2 mg kg(-1), respectively) were potentially toxic. However, quantification of the exchangeable metal fraction indicated that these metals were probably not bioavailable. Concentration of Cu-binding ligands in water was higher during the blooms, indicating that cyanobacteria are capable of changing the metal speciation in situ in a reservoir.
