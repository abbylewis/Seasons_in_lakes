J	Porcal, P; Hejzlar, J; Kopaácek, J				Porcal, P; Hejzlar, J; Kopaácek, J			Seasonal and photochemical changes of DOM in an acidified forest lake and its tributaries	AQUATIC SCIENCES					9th Meeting of the Nordic-Chapter-of-the-International-Humic-Substances-Society	MAY 19-21, 2003	Mid Sweden Univ, Sundswall, SWEDEN	Int Hum Substances Soc	Mid Sweden Univ			The concentration, composition, and photochemical changes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were evaluated in surface and bottom layers, and surface and subsurface tributaries of Plesne Lake, Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic, during one hydrological year. DOM was fractionated using the Amberlite XAD-8 and ion exchange resins into five fractions: hydrophilic neutrals, hydrophilic acids, hydrophilic and hydrophobic bases, hydrophobic acids, and hydrophobic neutrals. Photochemical transformations of DOM by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were tested with in-situ experiments using water from the surface tributary. The fraction composition of DOM was dominated by hydrophobic acids in all samples, with annual averages of 54-58% of DOM. The surface tributary differed from the subsurface one in higher and lower percentages of hydrophobic neutrals and hydrophilic neutrals, respectively. The surface and bottom water of the lake did not significantly differ in the composition of DOM fractions despite significantly higher DOM concentrations at the bottom. The results of in-situ photochemical experiments showed the significance of PAR in photochemical as well as biological transformations of allochthonous DOM in this lake. The net rates of photo-production of DIC and photochemical plus biological degradation of DOC ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 and 0.6 to 4.3 mumol L-1 day(-1), respectively, with maximum values in late spring. The hydrophobic acids fraction and the remaining DOM fractions were decomposed biologically (in dark bottles) and by combined photochemical and biological degradation (in transparent bottles) at similar rates, resulting in unchanged fraction composition of DOM in the experiments.

Summer E-coli Patterns and Responses along 23 Chicago Beaches	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concentrations of E coli in recreational beach water are highly variable both locally and temporally, but a broader understanding of these fluctuations may be explained through coastal observations. Currently, beach contamination study approaches tend to be site-specific under the belief that politically delineated beaches are unique and management of beaches cannot be regionally oriented. E coli data collected over five years from 23 Chicago beaches clearly identified ambient linked patterns at the regional scale. Temporal fluctuations were similar, with all beaches having simultaneous peaks and troughs of E coli concentrations. Spatially, E coli concentrations for beaches more closely situated were more closely correlated, indicating spatial autocorrelation. Julian day, wave height, and barometric pressure explained up to 40% of the variation, a value comparable to individual, less parsimonious site-specific models. Day of sampling could explain the majority of the variation in E coli concentrations, more so than beach, depth, or time of day. Comparing beaches along a targeted coastline allows a better understanding of inherent background regional fluctuations and, ultimately, better predictions of E coli concentrations in coastal recreational water.

J	Serizawa, H; Amemiya, T; Rossberg, AG; Itoh, K				Serizawa, Hiroshi; Amemiya, Takashi; Rossberg, Axel G.; Itoh, Kiminori			Computer simulations of seasonal outbreak and diurnal vertical migration of cyanobacteria	LIMNOLOGY												Algal blooms caused by cyanobacteria are characterized by two features with different time scales: one is seasonal outbreak and collapse of a bloom and the other is diurnal vertical migration. Our two-component mathematical model can simulate both phenomena, in which the state variables are nutrients and cyanobacteria. The model is a set of one-dimensional reaction-advection-diffusion equations, and temporal changes of these two variables are regulated by the following five factors: (1) annual variation of light intensity, (2) diurnal variation of light intensity, (3) annual variation of water temperature, (4) thermal stratification within a water column and (5) the buoyancy regulation mechanism. The seasonal change of cyanobacteria biomass is mainly controlled by factors, (1), (3) and (4), among which annual variations of light intensity and water temperature directly affect the maximum growth rate of cyanobacteria. The latter also contributes to formation of the thermocline during the summer season. Thermal stratification causes a reduction in vertical diffusion and largely prevents mixing of both nutrients and cyanobacteria between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. Meanwhile, the other two factors, (2) and (5), play a significant role in diurnal vertical migration of cyanobacteria. A key mechanism of vertical migration is buoyancy regulation due to gas-vesicle synthesis and ballast formation, by which a quick reversal between floating and sinking becomes possible within a water column. The mechanism of bloom formation controlled by these five factors is integrated into the one-dimensional model consisting of two reaction-advection-diffusion equations.					; Rossberg, Axel/G-1179-2010	Rossberg, Axel/0000-0001-9014-3176; Itoh, Kiminori/0000-0003-3619-8824; Amemiya, Takashi/0000-0002-3098-3875													1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2008	9	3					185	194		10.1007/s10201-008-0245-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-008-0245-5													WOS:000260470300002
J	BENNETT, GW; CHILDERS, WF				BENNETT, GW; CHILDERS, WF			LAKE CHUBSUCKER AS A FORAGE SPECIES	PROGRESSIVE FISH-CULTURIST												Through an accidental introduction and its ability to multiply and survive in habitat already inhabited by warm-water fished, the lake chubsucker (Erimyzon sucetta) became established in a large water-filled stone quarry in central Illinois inhabited by largemount bass, smallmouth bass, crappies, bluegills, redear sunfish, green sunfish, grass pickerel, and bullheads. The lake chubsucker produced shcools of fry in the shallows at a time when bass fry were schooling in the same areas. Experimental stocking of the lake chubsucher with largemouth bass, with smallmouth bass, and with largemouth bass and several kinds of hybrid sunfish, has indicated its usefulness. This species is desirable because it produces large numbers of young at an optimum time and location, it usually does not grow too large to fall prey to the larger bass, it does not increase the turbidity of the water even when relatively abundant, and it does not build up excessively large populations.																			0033-0779						1966	28	2					89	+		10.1577/1548-8640(1966)28[89:TLCAAF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8640(1966)28[89:TLCAAF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19667788800007

This visible tephra was discovered as part of a high resolution multiproxy re-investigation of the Les Echets sequence. Independent chronological information suggests that the tephra is c. 2 000-45 000 years old, and geochemical analysis indicates that it is of basanitic composition. The latter suggests a possible origin in the Eifel; however, as yet, no other volcanic events or deposits can be correlated to the Les Echets tephra. New sedimentological and chronological data are presented indicating that the tephra falls within an interval that most likely correlates with Dansgaard-Oeschger events 12-9. Thus, this tephra could potentially be an important middle MIS 3 marker horizon in central Europe if it can be traced in other palaeorecords.					; Davies, Siwan/E-6915-2011; Hormes, Anne/X-9995-2019; Veres, Daniel/AAX-3319-2020; Wastegard, Stefan/G-5720-2012	Hormes, Anne/0000-0002-7722-8252; Davies, Siwan/0000-0003-0999-7233; Veres, Daniel/0000-0003-3932-577X; Preusser, Frank/0000-0002-5654-1346; 													0300-9483	1502-3885					2008	37	3					434	443		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00028.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2008.00028.x													WOS:000257550400007

The 1st group was from the 1963 hatchery release (Kootenay Lake, British Columbia stock). They spawned from mid-Sept until early Nov. in the outlet stream, the main tributary, and along one section of the lake shore. The 2nd group, comprised of the natural-reared kokanee of the lake, spawned from early Dec. until mid-Jan., apparently along only one section of the lake shore. In addition, females of the 2 groups were significantly different (P< 0.05) in mean length and mean weight. The regressions of egg number on fork length showed no significant difference. Reasons for the selection of spawning sites and the origin of the stock of the second group are suggested.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1968	32	1					76	+		10.2307/3798238	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3798238													WOS:A1968A593400010

Air samples were collected simultaneously in intensive experiments during May and July 1994 and January 1995 in order to determine the influence of contaminated air masses from the Chicago urban/industrial complex on the southern Lake Michigan atmosphere. Gas phase Sigma PAH concentrations over the lake similar to 10-20 km offshore ranged from 0.8 to 70 ng/m(3) while urban air concentrations were 27-430 ng/m(3). Photooxidation of gas phase PAHs during the day resulted in daytime over-lake concentrations that were similar to 75% less than corresponding nighttime concentrations. Gas phase Sigma PCB concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 1.1 ng/m(3) over the lake and from 0.27 to 14 ng/m(3) in the urban area. Sigma PCB concentrations varied seasonally as a result of higher volatilization during the summer. The highest concentrations occurred when the air flow was from the urban/industrial area encompassing Evanston, IL, to Gary, IN, toward the lake, and concentrations were neat regional background when the wind was from any other direction. The urban air emissions increased the average coastal atmospheric concentrations above the continental background signal by factors of 12 and 4 for Sigma PAHs and Sigma PGBs, respectively. Because of photooxidation of gas phase PAHs during the day, the average daytime concentration was increased by only a factor of 5 while the average nighttime concentration was increased by a factor of 18.

Jake			A whole-lake experiment to control invasive rainbow smelt (Actinoperygii, Osmeridae) via overharvest and a food web manipulation	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Invasive rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) have spread rapidly throughout inland lakes of North America with detrimental effects on several native fishes. To test for the potential to control this species, we conducted an experimental removal of rainbow smelt in Sparkling Lake, Wisconsin during 2002-2009. We combined intensive spring harvest of rainbow smelt with an effort to increase predation on this invasive through restricted angler harvest of walleye and increased stocking of walleye (Sander vitreus). Over 4,170 kg of rainbow smelt were harvested during the experiment; up to 93% of adults were removed annually. We observed a significant decline in rainbow smelt gillnet catches during the removal. However, rainbow smelt relative abundances began increasing upon cessation of the removal effort. Bioenergetics modeling suggested that despite achieving higher than the regional average walleye densities, walleye consumed only a fraction of the rainbow smelt standing stock biomass. Our findings suggest that removal of rainbow smelt from invaded lakes may be difficult, and reinforce the importance of prevention as a strategy to limit the expansion of this invasive fish.

With the change of climatic conditions and diversion scheme, the inflow of fresh water also varies greatly, which makes the content of anionic cation in Mono Lake also changes. We detect the change of material concentration and anion content in Mono Lake by the change of geographical position and water level of Mono Lake. We also compared the content of anions and cations in average spring water and average stream water. Find out the characteristics of the ion content in Mono Lake and try to speculate the reasons. Through the analysis of the relationship between different anions and cations, PH concentration factor and molarity change in ordinary water, and the inference of the cause of their change, the changes of anions and cations composition in mono Lake Water with the change of water level were detected.																			1755-1307						2021	632								022043	10.1088/1755-1315/632/2/022043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/632/2/022043													WOS:000688420700043

Seasonal sampling dynamics of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in northeastern South Dakota	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Numerous studies on smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) have focused on movements, diets, and capture rates among habitat types, but we are aware of no study that has documented capture rates and size structure by month to aid in assessment and management of this fish. The objective of this study was to determine monthly sampling dynamics and population size structure of smallmouth bass in four northeastern South Dakota glacial lakes. Smallmouth bass were collected monthly (May-September) from Enemy Swim Lake and Roy Lake in 2007 and Clear Lake and Pickerel Lake in 2008 using modified-fyke nets and night electrofishing in rocky habitats. Monthly mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) values for smallmouth bass collected with fyke nets were variable but generally low (0.2-4.7 fish/net night) across months and lakes. Monthly mean CPUE values for smallmouth bass collected by electrofishing were variable in all four lakes (99.7-771.8 fish/h); however, in Clear Lake and Enemy Swim Lake CPUE significantly increased from May through September, primarily due to age-0 bass becoming vulnerable to electrofishing. For all lakes except Clear Lake, there were no significant differences in monthly mean CPUE values of 180mm and longer smallmouth bass. Length distributions varied by month, but in general May and June samples contained a higher proportion of larger individuals than later sampling months. Overall mean relative weight (Wr) values were greater than 80, but relative weight varied among lakes and months. Our results suggest that spring (May to June) sampling of smallmouth bass using night electrofishing in rocky habitats will result in the broadest length range of captured bass.

J	HUTCHINSON, TA				HUTCHINSON, TA			AN ANALYSIS OF NMC NESTED GRID MODEL FORECASTS OF ALBERTA CLIPPERS	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Forecasts of Alberta Clipper-type cyclones, defined as cyclones that move southeastward from regions of western Canada into south-central Canada or the north-central United States before moving eastward to the coast of North America, were studied using the National Meteorological Center's Nested Grid Model (NGM). All available NGM forecasts between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 1992, excluding the months of June, July, and August, were analyzed. The 5-yr sample included 59 Alberta Clippers. For each case, the cyclone center position and central pressure were recorded for the NGM's initialization (0 h) and for 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-h forecasts for each available run. Average cyclone position errors ranged from 140 km, with a standard deviation of 183 km at 12 h, to 339 km, with a standard deviation of 407 km at 48 h. Average central pressure errors ranged from 0.0 hPa, with a standard deviation of 2.5 hPa at 12 h, to 1.0 hPa, with a standard deviation of 5.7 hPa at 48 h. East of 84.0 degrees W, cyclones verified farther east than forecast. West of 84.0 degrees W, the NGM tended to forecast the cyclones farther north and slightly farther west than they were seen to verify. Positional and pressure forecast errors over and near the Great Lakes were found to be smaller than in other areas.																			0882-8156					SEP	1995	10	3					632	641		10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010<0632:AAONNG>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1995)010<0632:AAONNG>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995RQ78400014

Recent history of nonindigenous species in the Laurentian Great Lakes; An update to Mills et al., 1993 (25 years later)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The seminal work of Mills et al. (1993) lists 137 established aquatic species as nonindigenous to the Great Lakes (two plants are further subdivided into two subspecies groups). We have removed seven of these species: three have been redefined as probably native, and four plants (including both subspecies of Sonchus arvensis) have been reclassified as terrestrial. Thirty-five species that arrived prior to 1993 (some due to reclassification, some due to a time lag in discovery and reporting) have been added to the list. Twenty-four new species have become established post-1993, bringing the total to 188 (with Pluchea odorata including two subspecies). Notably, 21 of the 23 species were introduced between 1993 and 2006, but only 3 new species have been documented with new reproducing and overwintering populations in the last decade. Multiple revisions have been made to taxonomy and introduction dates based on additional review of literature and museum/herbarium collections. Over the most recent 25 years, the rate of introduction of nonindigenous species capable of becoming established has declined. With the 2006 expansion of ballast regulations to include residual ballast sediments in vessels declaring 'No Ballast on Board', the rate of new invasions has fallen to a low of only 0.25 species per year.

Weak Response of Animal Allochthony and Production to Enhanced Supply of Terrestrial Leaf Litter in Nutrient-Rich Lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												Ecosystems are generally linked via fluxes of nutrients and energy across their boundaries. For example, freshwater ecosystems in temperate regions may receive significant inputs of terrestrially derived carbon via autumnal leaf litter. This terrestrial particulate organic carbon (POC) is hypothesized to subsidize animal production in lakes, but direct evidence is still lacking. We divided two small eutrophic lakes each into two sections and added isotopically distinct maize litter to the treatment sections to simulate increased terrestrial POC inputs via leaf litter in autumn. We quantified the reliance of aquatic consumers on terrestrial resources (allochthony) in the year subsequent to POC additions by applying mixing models of stable isotopes. We also estimated lake-wide carbon (C) balances to calculate the C flow to the production of the major aquatic consumer groups: benthic macroinvertebrates, crustacean zooplankton, and fish. The sum of secondary production of crustaceans and benthic macroinvertebrates supported by terrestrial POC was higher in the treatment sections of both lakes. In contrast, total secondary and tertiary production (supported by both autochthonous and allochthonous C) was higher in the reference than in the treatment sections of both lakes. Average aquatic consumer allochthony per lake section was 27-40%, although terrestrial POC contributed less than about 10% to total organic C supply to the lakes. The production of aquatic consumers incorporated less than 5% of the total organic C supply in both lakes, indicating a low ecological efficiency. We suggest that the consumption of terrestrial POC by aquatic consumers facilitates a strong coupling with the terrestrial environment. However, the high autochthonous production and the large pool of autochthonous detritus in these nutrient-rich lakes make terrestrial POC quantitatively unimportant for the C flows within food webs.

Effects of thermocline deepening on lake plankton communities	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Theory predicts, and some evidence demonstrates that in lakes, the depth of the thermocline can have a large structural influence on the spatial distribution, and strongly influences the composition of plankton communities. However, experimental assessments of responses of the planktonic food web to thermocline depth have not yet been done at the whole-basin scale. We conducted an experiment wherein we artificially lowered the thermocline in an isolated basin of a three-basin lake, maintaining another isolated basin as a control. The vertical distribution and taxonomic composition of both phytoplankton and zooplankton were monitored throughout the summer months. Greater phytoplankton production, especially in the epilimnion, attributable mainly to increases in the chlorophytes was observed with thermocline deepening, but at the deepest thermoclines, production was limited. Total zooplankton biomass was unaffected by thermocline depth, suggesting top-down control by predators. Zooplankton biomass peaks were less pronounced in the manipulated basin, but tended to follow the thermocline whether at its normal position or as it was deepened. Zooplankton composition was significantly altered by large increases in densities of predatory cyclopoid copepods and rotifers; taxa commonly found in turbulent environments. Overall, both phytoplankton and zooplankton communities demonstrated important shifts in structure and composition in response to thermocline deepening.					; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020	Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Prairie, Yves/0000-0003-1210-992X; Cantin, Ariane/0000-0003-1931-8556; Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781													0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2011	68	2					260	276		10.1139/F10-138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F10-138													WOS:000288098700008

North Halfmoon Lake and Lofty Lake (Alberta, Canada) were chosen for whole-lake liming experiments as a new restoration technology to enhance calcite precipitation and reduce eutrophication. During a 3-year study (1991-93) the relationships between zooplankton and phytoplankton were assessed, together with the effects of lime additions. 2. Zooplankton communities were numerically dominated by rotifers, while the major contribution to biomass was due to large filter-feeding Daphnia during the first half of the summer season. In Lofty Lake, cladocerans made up to 93% of biomass, whereas in North Halfmoon Lake both cladocerans and calanoids were strongly represented. 3. Total zooplankton and cladoceran biomasses were inversely correlated with chlorophyll a (chl a). The same relationship was found between large Daphnia (greater than or equal to 1 mm) and chi a. These relationships suggest that the decline in Daphnia may have been caused by an increase in cyanobacteria biomass during bloom events. 4. There were minor changes in rotifer populations after liming; however, these changes have been caused by natural year-to-year Variation rather than liming. In general, cladocerans showed an increase in body size and population biomass when pre and post-treatment data were compared by means of ANCOVA. Statistical analysis showed that there were more cladocerans per unit of chi a after liming; however, further research is needed to relate these patterns unambiguously to the application of lime as a restoration technology.

In all years, basic CuSO4 gave better control of greasy spot on leaves and fruit when applied in June or July, during or after peak ascospore release, than in late April or early May, before major ascospore discharge began. Benomyl controlled greasy spot as well as the Cu fungicide did prior to a shift in pathogen population from benomyl sensitive to benomyl tolerant. Greasy spot control on leaves with oil was affected little by time of spraying, and it often equaled that provided by a well-timed Cu fungicide treatment. However, unlike summer application of basic copper sulfate, oil gave variable and often no control of greasy spot rind blotch.																			0191-2917	1943-7692					1982	66	8					687	690		10.1094/PD-66-687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-66-687													WOS:A1982NY45100019

Therefore, there is a necessity to look into the water standards before the usage. This is a problem that can greatly benefit from Artificial Intelligence (AI). Traditional methods require human inspection and is time consuming. Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) facilities supply machine learning with push of a button, or, on a minimum level, ensure to retain algorithm execution, data pipelines, and code, generally, are kept from sight and are anticipated to be the stepping stone for normalising AI. However, it is still a field under research. This work aims to recognize the areas where an AutoML system falls short or outperforms a traditional expert system built by data scientists. Keeping this as the motive, this work dives into the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for comparing AutoML and an expert architecture built by the authors for Water Quality Assessment to evaluate the Water Quality Index, which gives the general water quality, and the Water Quality Class, a term classified on the basis of the Water Quality Index. The results prove that the accuracy of AutoML and TPOT was 1.4 % higher than conventional ML techniques for binary class water data. For Multi class water data, AutoML was 0.5 % higher and TPOT was 0.6% higher than conventional ML techniques.

Eurytemora lacustris was found in all of the studied lakes, with the highest abundance (8 ind. L-1) in Lake Wigry. In Lake Szurpiy, E. lacustris has never been recorded before. The results of this study revealed that E. lacustris was most numerous in thermocline zones, suggesting that this species could temporarily tolerate warmer water and lower oxygen concentrations due to better food resources. During the study, it was found that a large part of the E. lacustris population had epibiont ciliates, in contrast to other species of zooplankton that did not have any epibionts. The improvement in the water quality of many deep lakes could lead to an increase in the abundance of E. lacustris. However, epibiont ciliates may be a threat for this species and may play a substantial role in determining the production, distribution, and community dynamics of E. lacustris.

J	BARTH, S				BARTH, S			BORON ISOTOPE VARIATIONS IN NATURE - A SYNTHESIS	GEOLOGISCHE RUNDSCHAU												The large relative mass difference between the two stable isotopes of boron, B-10 and B-11, and the high geochemical reactivity of boron lead to significant isotope fractionation by natural processes. Published deltaB-11 values (relative to the NBS SRM-951 standard) span a wide range of almost-equal-to 90 parts per thousand. The lowest deltaB-11 values around - 30 parts per thousand are reported for non-marine evaporite minerals and certain tourmalines. The most B-11-enriched reservoir known to date are brines from Australian salt lakes and the Dead Sea of Israel with deltaB-11 values up to + 59 parts per thousand. Dissolved boron in present-day seawater has a constant world-wide deltaB-11 value of + 39.5 parts per thousand. In this paper, available deltaB-11 data of a variety of natural fluid and solid samples from different geological environments are compiled and some of the most relevant aspects, including possible tracer applications of boron-isotope geochemistry, are summarized.																			0016-7835					DEC	1993	82	4					640	651																WOS:A1993MQ03600005

The seasonal occurrence of 25 pharmaceuticals including 23 antibiotics, paracetamol (PAR), and carbamazepine (CMZ) in Taihu Lake was investigated; meanwhile, the distribution and removal of these pharmaceuticals in two drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) and a constructed wetland were evaluated. A high detection frequency (>70%) in the Taihu Lake was observed for nearly all the 25 pharmaceutics. Chlortetracycline (234.7 ng L-1), chloramphenicol (27.1 ng L-1), erythromycin (72.6 ng L-1), PAR (71.7 ng L-1), and CMZP (23.6 ng L-1) are compounds with both a high detection frequency (100%) and the highest concentrations, suggesting their wide use in the Taihu Basin. Higher concentrations of chloramphenicols, macrolides, PAR, and CMZP were observed in dry season than in wet season, probably due to the low flow conditions of the lake in winter and the properties of pharmaceuticals. The overall contamination levels of antibiotic pharmaceutics (0.2-74.9 ng L-1) in the Taihu Lake were lower than or comparable to those reported worldwide. However, for nonantibiotic pharmaceutics, PAR (45.0 ng L-1) and CMZP (14.5 ng L-1), significantly higher concentrations were observed in the Taihu Lake than at a global scale. High detection frequencies of 25 pharmaceuticals were observed in both the two DWTPs (100%) and the wetland (>60%) except for florfenicol and sulfapyridine. The removal efficacies of the studied pharmaceuticals in DWTP B with advanced treatment processes including ozonation and granular activated carbon filtration (16.7-100%) were superior to DWTP A with conventional treatment processes (2.9-100%), except for sulfonamides. Wetland C with the constructed root channel technology was efficient (24.2-100%) for removing most pharmaceuticals. This work suggests that the application of cost-effective technologies such as constructed wetlands should be considered as an efficient alternative for removing pharmaceuticals from water supply sources.					; hu, ongxia/GQP-8544-2022; 胡, 君健/JFK-8122-2023	Hu, Xialin/0000-0003-0897-0741; hu, junjian/0000-0002-9668-2645													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	17					14889	14902		10.1007/s11356-017-8830-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8830-y								28478598					WOS:000402997700030
J	Williams, MAJ; Adamson, D; Cock, B; McEvedy, R				Williams, MAJ; Adamson, D; Cock, B; McEvedy, R			Late Quaternary environments in the White Nile region, Sudan	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Both the channel of the lower White Nile and the soils adjacent to the river have a number of special characteristics, which are a direct reflection of its unique late Quaternary history. These attributes include a straight channel pattern (despite a flood gradient of 1 in 100000 and a very fine suspension load) and localised concentrations of buried evaporites, carbonates, and highly saline subsoils at intervals alongside the river. Late Quaternary aeolian, fluviatile and lacustrine deposits in and near the lower White Nile valley reveal a strong contrast between the often dry, cold and windy late Pleistocene climates characteristic of the Last Glacial Maximum (18000 +/- 3000 BP) and the wetter and warmer climates prevalent in those regions towards 11500-11000 BP, 9500 BP and 8500-7000 BP. Buried shell-beds and recessional strandlines indicate a sudden and rapid regression of the vastly expanded terminal Pleistocene White Nile in possible Younger Dryas times (11000-10000 BP) coinciding with probable temporary closure of Lake Victoria in the Ugandan upper reaches of the White Nile. The stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of freshwater gastropod shells in the lower White Nile region is consistent with a stronger summer monsoon towards 11500-11000 BP and again towards 8500-7000 BP. At intervals between ca. 18 000 and 12000 BP, the lower White Nile was a strongly seasonal river, which shifted course frequently and carried large quantities of medium and coarse sand. The present Sudd swamps in the southern Sudan cannot have been in existence during those times, but came into existence (or became reestablished), during the Holocene. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Hjerpe, EE				Hjerpe, Evan E.			Outdoor Recreation as a Sustainable Export Industry: A Case Study of the Boundary Waters Wilderness	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in northeastern Minnesota contains more than a million acres of connected lakes and rivers. As one of the most heavily visited U.S. Wilderness areas, the BWCAW represents an ecosystem managed primarily for conservation values that also has a substantial regional economic impact. This combination of high visitation and strong conservation management represents a sustainable symbiotic relationship where visitor expenditures help maintain ecosystem protection. To investigate this symbiotic relationship, the regional economic impacts of the BWCAW were estimated. Multiplier effects were calculated and the sustainability and tradeoffs associated with BWCAW tourism were examined, as was the export nature of BWCAW recreation. Data collection consisted of surveying 2016 summer BWCAW visitors. Visitor regional expenditures were extrapolated to overall visitation data and entered into IMPLAN impact analysis software. Based on 513 completed surveys, and an overall survey response rate of 40%, out-of-region visitors spent over $56 million in the three counties surrounding the BWCAW in 2016, generating $78 million in total economic output and creating 1100 full and part-time jobs. Estimated economic impacts of outdoor recreation and their sustainability can be helpful for informing regional economic development policy for conservation areas world-wide.

Geomorphology of Talacasto alluvial fan, Precordillera of San Juan, Argentina	JOURNAL OF MAPS												We present a 1: 50,000 geomorphological map of the Talacasto river alluvial fan (93 km(2)), located in the Central Andean Precordillera of Argentina. The aim of this map is to identify and classify dynamic and potentially destructive geomorphological processes such as gully erosion, headward erosion, concentrated erosion, laminar erosion and similar features that are present in an alluvial fan, so as to identify unstable sectors for public infrastructure. This map is the result of combining remote sensing data, aerial photographs analysis and fieldwork. Landforms and active geomorphological processes are identified, classified and illustrated for this Quaternary alluvial fan. Four Quaternary landscape subunits were classified, taking into account morphogenetic characteristics and erosional processes such as: (1) Exhumed and erosional landforms inducted by neotectonic activity; (2) Alluvial landforms; (3) Polygenetic landforms covered in glacis; and (4) Playa lake landforms. The presence of desert pavements and salt-hardened subsoil formations contributes to the generation and transmission of surface runoff during summer heavy rains, causing alluvial hazards and damages in routes and roads.																			1744-5647					DEC 4	2017	13	2					929	935		10.1080/17445647.2017.1409138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17445647.2017.1409138													WOS:000424375000001

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The effect of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) loading on trophic structure and water clarity was studied during summer in 24 field enclosures fixed in, and kept open to, the sediment in a shallow lake. The experiment involved a control treatment and five treatments to which nutrients were added: (i) high phosphorus, (ii) moderate nitrogen, (iii) high nitrogen, (iv) high phosphorus and moderate nitrogen and (v) high phosphorus and high nitrogen. To reduce zooplankton grazers, 1(+) fish (Perca fluviatilis L.) were stocked in all enclosures at a density of 3.7 individuals m(-2). 2. With the addition of phosphorus, chlorophyll a and the total biovolume of phytoplankton rose significantly at moderate and high nitrogen. Cyanobacteria or chlorophytes dominated in all enclosures to which we added phosphorus as well as in the high nitrogen treatment, while cryptophytes dominated in the moderate nitrogen enclosures and the controls. 3. At the end of the experiment, the biomass of the submerged macrophytes Elodea canadensis and Potamogeton sp. was significantly lower in the dual treatments (TN, TP) than in single nutrient treatments and controls and the water clarity declined. The shift to a turbid state with low plant coverage occurred at TN >2 mg N L-1 and TP >0.13-0.2 mg P L-1. These results concur with a survey of Danish shallow lakes, showing that high macrophyte coverage occurred only when summer mean TN was below 2 mg N L-1, irrespective of the concentration of TP, which ranged between 0.03 and 1.2 mg P L-1. 4. Zooplankton biomass and the zooplankton : phytoplankton biomass ratio, and probably also the grazing pressure on phytoplankton, remained overall low in all treatments, reflecting the high fish abundance chosen for the experiment. We saw no response to nutrition addition in total zooplankton biomass, indicating that the loss of plants and a shift to the turbid state did not result from changes in zooplankton grazing. Shading by phytoplankton and periphyton was probably the key factor. 5. Nitrogen may play a far more important role than previously appreciated in the loss of submerged macrophytes at increased nutrient loading and for the delay in the re-establishment of the nutrient loading reduction. We cannot yet specify, however, a threshold value for N that would cause a shift to a turbid state as it may vary with fish density and climatic conditions. However, the focus should be widened to use control of both N and P in the restoration of eutrophic shallow lakes.

Each sub -basin in the landscape records the interplay between active tectonism and shifting climate. Many of the basins in southern Nevada that contain deposits of the Muddy Creek Formation were closed fluvio-lacustrine systems during the latest Miocene and into the Pliocene. They were subsequently integrated into the regional Colorado River system. Lacustrine deposits of the Muddy Creek Formation are exposed along the trace of the Las Vegas Valley shear zone in the Nellis Dunes Recreation Area (NDRA), northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The Muddy Creek Formation in NDRA consists of approximately 130 m of mixed carbonates and clastics, and new tephrochronology suggests an early to late Pliocene age (N 4.7 to N 2.6 Ma) for the lowermost lacustrine deposits and an unknown, but younger, age for the uppermost spring -fed lacustrine deposit. These sediments were deposited in an arid to semiarid lake (Lake Nellis) and alluvial floodplain system based on the interpretation of lithologies and facies associations. The stratigraphic succession coarsens upward and reflects establishment of a lacustrine carbonate system overlain by a clastic succession of peripheral lake sediments of alluvial and floodplain origin. The peripheral lake deposits consist of spring -fed and fluvial wetland mudflats of brown claystone and siltstone. This brown claystone is capped by a succession of yellow and red sandstones deposited by fluvial and minor eolian processes. The second, and youngest, freshwater limestone, likely disconformably, overlies the yellow and red sandstones, and is thought to be temporally and depositionally distinct from the underlying Muddy Creek deposits. The transition from the lower lacustrine carbonates to clastic fluvial channel and flood -plain deposits indicates desiccation of Lake Nellis and possibly occurs soon after N 2.7 to N 2.6 Ma based on the ages of tuffs occurring in the uppermost limestone and marl beds. This is consistent with an interpreted increase in regional aridity after N 2.8 Ma (Smith et al. 1993). The second limestone deposit at the top of the section represents an even younger spring -fed lacustrine deposit of unknown age. Throughout the lower carbonate section, three tuffs were identified, and geochemically correlated, using a discriminant -function analysis, to the tuff of Napa (# 4.70 6 0.03 Ma), the Putah Tuff (N 3.3 Ma), and the lower tuffs of the Badlands (N 2.7 to N 2.6 Ma). The timing of deposition of Lake Nellis sediments postdates the integration of the three major lake systems in this region (Lake Grand Wash, Lake Hualapai, and Lake Las Vegas) into the Colorado River drainage (5.6-4.9 Ma), and also postdates the full integration of the river to sea level (4.8-4.63 Ma) (Howard et al. 2015; Crow et al. 2021). Lake Nellis represents an isolated lake basin that was one, and maybe the last, lacustrine system to be fully integrated into the Colorado River drainage in this region.

Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) Can Guide Decision-Making in Inland Fisheries Management	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												Evaluating and integrating local ecological knowledge held by fishers into decision-making processes has the potential to significantly enhance fisheries management. The present study aimed to collect information on fishery practices and to assess the ecological knowledge of local professional fishers through interviews, evaluating its importance in managerial design. As a case study, Polyphytos Reservoir in Greece, which supports substantial fisheries, was selected. During the summer of 2023, thirty-seven interviews were conducted to document fishing efforts, methods, catches, biological information, and fishers' perspectives on lake management, and economic/demographic details. In addition to gathering data on fishing activities, the study seeks to understand fishers' perspectives on managerial deficiencies and necessities, thereby revealing their valuable ecological knowledge. The integration of this knowledge into decision-making processes can empower stakeholders and enhance local participation in fishery management. Ultimately, this approach has the potential to address long-standing conflicts, foster inclusive processes, and ensure better collective outcomes.					; PETRIKI, OLGA/I-6493-2018	Kouletsos, Athanasios/0009-0007-5264-2864; Ntislidou, Chrysoula/0000-0002-8313-7613														2076-3417				OCT	2024	14	19							8819	10.3390/app14198819	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app14198819													WOS:001332205700001

Diet of juvenile Galaxias maculatus (Galaxiidae) during the upstream migration period in the lower Waikato River, New Zealand	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												We analysed 344 juvenile Galaxias maculatus (length 35-59 mm) collected from two sites in the lower Waikato River, North Island, New Zealand, to determine diet during the period of upstream migration (August-November). In total, 53% of guts contained invertebrate food items comprising 16 taxa, with Cladocera numerically most abundant overall (32% of items), followed by Chironomidae, Saldidae and unidentified Insecta (18-24%). Cladocera heavily dominated G. maculatus diet in October (74-97%), particularly at the upper site, which was downstream of a lake- and wetland-fed tributary inflow. There were greater proportions of the cladocerans Bosmina and Daphnia and fewer Copepoda or Rotifera in guts compared with relative abundances in river water at locations where fish were caught during the day. These results highlight the potential importance of a range of foods items, in particular large zooplankton, to the diet of migratory juvenile G. maculatus, and implicate off-channel habitats as potential sources of cladoceran food following spring high flow events.

Heterogeneity of archaeal and bacterial ammonia-oxidizing communities in Lake Taihu, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												P>Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) communities within the surface sediments of Lake Taihu, a large eutrophic freshwater lake in China, were investigated using molecular approaches targeting the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene. Large intra-lake variability in the composition and the relative abundance of both groups of ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes was observed. Archaeal amoA far outnumbered bacterial amoA at most sites except those located in the Eastern Taihu Bay. This bay, which is used for intensive pen aquaculture, harboured the most unique AOA communities but was dominated by AOB in terms of relative abundance. Accumulation of organic substances rather than presence of submersed macrophytes significantly influenced the relative abundance of AOA. In contrast, shifts in the abundance of AOB were not found to be significantly related to the investigated environmental parameters. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all archaeal amoA sequences fell within either the Crenarchaeotal Group (CG) I.1b or the CG I.1a subgroup, and all AOB clustered exclusively with the genus Nitrosomonas. These findings represent the first detailed survey of AOA in eutrophic freshwater lake sediments by demonstrating that AOA dominate the ammonia-oxidizing communities, and are negatively correlated with the accumulation of organic substances.

J	Pensgaard, AM				Pensgaard, Anne Marte			CONSULTING UNDER PRESSURE: HOW TO HELP AN ATHLETE DEAL WITH UNEXPECTED DISTRACTERS DURING OLYMPIC GAMES 2006	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY												Norway has strong traditions when it comes to doing well in Winter Olympics. In 2002 in Salt Lake City, Norway became the best nation (i.e., most gold medals and overall points), and thus the expectations leading up to the 2006 Turin Games in Italy were high. The goal was 25 medals, although it ended up with 19. This was regarded as rather poor results among the Norwegian sports journalists. The evaluation following the Games revealed that illness and lack of mental preparations were two of the key factors to which the athletes attributed the disappointing results. To illustrate the dynamics during the Games and how the expectations and the mixed results influenced one of the athletes and also the work of the sport psychologist, a case is presented. The role of a nation's collective efficacy and how it may influence the athletes is discussed, as well as the role of the coach as an important mediator regarding how an athlete may or may not cope during such circumstances.

Sustainable management of freshwater crayfish (koura, Paranephrops planifrons) in Te Arawa (Rotorua) lakes, North Island, New Zealand	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Freshwater crayfish or koura (Paranephrops planifrons White, 1842) support important customary fisheries for Te Arawa iwi (tribal members) in the Te Arawa lakes, North Island, New Zealand. Until recently, however, there was limited published information on which to base fisheries regulations. We sampled over 9000 koura in eight lakes using a traditional Maori harvesting method known as the tau koura which comprised bundles of bracken fern fronds (Pteridium esculentum) laid on the lake bed. We examined the catch rates and biological traits of koura in the Te Arawa lakes and the implications for the current fishing regulations and koura management. koura were present in all of the study lakes except Okaro, but harvestable quantities were only found in Rotorua, Rotoma and Rotoiti. The overall ratio of females to males was about 1:1. Egg-bearing koura were found throughout the year, but only occasionally during the summer months. Koura fecundity increased as a power function of orbit-carapace length (OCL). Size at onset of breeding for 50% of females, in lakes where koura were present, ranged from 22.1 mm OCL to 27.5 mm OCL. In addition to existing regulations, the following management measures are recommended: (1) implementing a slot limit with a minimum size of 28 mm and a maximum size of 39 mm OCL, (2) banning the taking of egg-bearing koura, (3) limiting deep-water harvest methods to the use of the tau koura, and (4) implementing a tau koura harvest season beginning on 1 December and ending on 31 March.

Reasons for this are too high nutrient inputs and high efficiency of internal nutrient recycling and transformation into phytoplankton biomass. In our NITROLIMIT-project (nitrolimit.de) it has been proven that nitrogen is a crucial control variable for the majority of shallow lakes and its reduction is ecologically meaningful. This was checked by a balance approach in a polymictic eutrophic lake for nitrogen input (external inputs from surface inflow, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen fixation by nostocalaen cyanobacteria), output by surface outflow and internal turnover processes (primary production, release of ammonia from the sediment). Lake Langer See is part of a riverine system in lake chain of Scharmutzelsee region (Brandenburg, Germany). It is a very shallow and eutrophic lake with theoretical water retention time of 30 days. Dominant nitrogen input is the surface inflow consisting more than 80% of organic nitrogen. During vegetation period, input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and lake concentration are very low and primary production is limited by availability of inorganic nitrogen. Despite of this low DIN concentration pelagic primary production is high and phytoplankton is dominated by cyanobacteria resulting in a poor ecological quality of the lake. We could prove that short cycling of nitrogen by ammonification in the pelagic water and in the surface sediment are the main drivers for the high intensity of phytoplankton primary production. An intensive short-term recycling of freshly settled detritus can compensate the relatively low external nitrogen inputs. Although N-2 fixation during late summer is low compared to sediment release of ammonia by ammonification, we suggest a relevant short-term competition for nostocalean cyanobacteria. N-2 fixation can contribute to stabilization of high level of phytoplankton primary production as an additional nitrogen input during summer. Management measures should include a reduction of organic nitrogen input rather than nitrate load reduction for these lake types. Moreover, possibilities of top down control should be complemented with top down mechanisms like macrophyte competition and grazing by zooplankton and mussels.

The rotifer fauna from plankton of 17 lentic freshwaters is listed and commented upon. Species richness (39 taxa) and species diversity are fairly low. Only 6 taxa are euplanktic, the others are facultative plankters or littoral/benthic species. Three of the true plankters found are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, whereas the rest of the rotifers (apart from two unidentified monogononts) shows a wide-spread or cosmopolitan distribution. Thirty-three taxa are new to the Kerguelen archipelago. A comparison is made with the rotifer assemblages observed on other Subantarctic islands. Taxonomic notes on little known species are added. The validity of Cephalodella gibba microdactyla as separate subspecies is rejected, and Filinia terminalis kergueleniensis is recognized as junior synonym of F. pejleri.

Perch spawned inshore during early spring; hatching occurred 10-20 days after spawning. Newly hatched perch were 5.6-6.2 mm total length (TL). Soon after hatching the larvae moved into the limnetic zone where they began feeding. This movement is probably a mechanism to escape intense predation in the littoral zone. Normally the 1st food of perch was immature copepods, but within a week they incorporated all common zooplankters into their diet. When the perch reached 25 mm TL (about day 40) they returned to the littoral zone, where they are larger and more abundant prey than was present in the limnetic habitat. There is no correlation between growth rates and zooplankton abundances, which suggests that food quantity is not a limiting factor in the early life history of perch in Lake Itasca.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1985	12	1					47	56		10.1007/BF00007709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007709													WOS:A1985ADN1100005

Influence of habitat heterogeneity on the foraging ecology of first feeding yellow perch larvae, Perca flavescens, in western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The diet of first-feeding fish larvae can influence their future growth and survival. The foraging ecology of yellow perch (YP) larvae was studied in western Lake Erie, a region characterized by habitat heterogeneity associated with the Maumee River Plume (MRP) and a high prevalence of invasive species. To determine the influence of the MRP on YP diet, water physical characteristics, zooplankton prey community, and larval YP diet and foraging selectivity were compared between MRP and non-MRP waters, 2006-2008. Water temperature was higher, while water clarity was lower in the MRP when compared to non-MRP waters. The zooplankton prey community (groups constituting >1% of YP prey items) did not differ between MRP and non-MRP waters, being composed of small dadocerans, cyclopoid and calanoid copepods and non-native dreissenid mussel veligers. Ration increased with YP total length cm, with no differences found between MRP and non-MRP waters. Diet composition also varied with larval YP length, with the smallest larvae preying more heavily on dreissenid veligers than larger fish, and no differences between MRP and non-MRP waters. Most sizes of larvae positively selected for cyclopoid copepods in MRP and non-MRP waters, while selection for other prey was neutral or negative. Our study reveals a similar zooplankton community and larval foraging ecology between MRP and non-MRP waters during spring season, despite habitat physical differences, and points to mechanisms unassociated with larval foraging (i.e., predation) as a reason for higher recruitment of YP residing inside versus outside of the MRP as larvae.

Water, Water Everywhere: Perceptions of Chaotic Water Regimes in Northeastern Siberia, Russia	GLOBAL WARMING AND HUMAN - NATURE DIMENSION IN NORTHERN EURASIA	Global Environmental Studies											This paper explores applied anthropological research examining perceptions, understandings and responses to increasing water on the land, one of the major effects of global climate change for native Viliui Sakha agropastoralist communities of northeastern Siberia, Russia. The paper draws on fieldwork investigating perceptions, understandings and responses to the local effects of global climate change for native Viliui Sakha agropastoralist communities of northeastern Siberia, Russia. For Viliui Sakha, global climate change translates locally into a highly altered climate system and water regime. 2008 fieldwork shows Inhabitants observing warmer winters, increased snowfall, excessive precipitation, changed seasonality, and the transformation of their ancestral landscape due to increased water on the land and degrading permafrost. One urgent change is how the increased water on the land is turning hayfields into lakes, inundating households and ruining transportation networks. The increasing water on the land interferes with subsistence and threatens to undermine settlement. Beyond these physical changes, what does the increased water on the land mean to Viliui Sakha? Inhabitants expressed not only concern about their future but also common fear that they would 'go under water.' Water has visceral meaning to Sakha, based on their historically-based belief system, their adaptation to their environment, and knowledge system. In response, 2009 field research looked in more depth at communities' perceptions of water, and worked to bring those perceptions and beliefs into our 2010 knowledge exchange exercise. This paper will present our initial findings and make suggestions on how these findings can be understood more broadly for other peoples unprecedentedly affected by water crises in the face of global climate change.																			2192-6336		978-981-10-4648-3; 978-981-10-4647-6				2018							1	10		10.1007/978-981-10-4648-3_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-4648-3_1	10.1007/978-981-10-4648-3												WOS:000432244100002

A study of all known populations revealed that this species is virtually restricted to excessively-drained yellow sands in areas that support evergreen oak-dominated scrub vegetation. Microhabitats supporting individual plants have lower litter cover and depth, and greater sky opening, than microhabitats lacking D. frutescens, and tend to be dominated to a greater extent by herbaceous species. Spring fire, defoliation, or removal of aboveground tissues killed 100% of Dicerandra frutescens individuals in field experiments. Control mortality rates for the six-month period were 38-54%. D. frutescens populations recruited following fire from seed stored in the soil. The sensitivity of this narrow endemic to loss of aboveground tissue is consistent with its recently described chemical defense.																			0040-9618					JUL-SEP	1992	119	3					308	313		10.2307/2996762	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2996762													WOS:A1992JQ81100007
J	Mörner, NA				Mörner, NA			Sea level and climate:: rapid regressions at local warm phases	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Observational data are presented which indicate that periods of rapid sea level regression in the Stockholm area (2650-2550 BP, 1600-1500 BP and 980-900 BP) were correlated with short periods of exceptional local-to-regional dryness (2550-2500 BP, 1530-1470 BP and 960-880 BP). This novel climatic-eustatic relation is understood in terms of (1) a local-to-regional eustatic drop in sea level due to a dry period (in the order of 50-100 yr) with stationary summer high pressure and very low water run-off into the Baltic land its embayment over the Lake Malaren valley), and (2) a smaller regional sea level drop due to decreased transport of water along the Gulf Stream. It seems significant that the regressional amplitudes at Stockholm in the Baltic are larger than those recorded on the Swedish west coast and far larger than the small cm-oscillations recorded in the subsiding North Sea region.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the water quality of Ergene River Basin components (Merit and Ergene Rivers and 10 most significant tributaries of the basin) by investigating 25 trace and toxic element concentrations (Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Tl and Pb). Water samples were collected in rainy season (spring) of 2018 from 21 stations and element levels were investigated by using an ICP-MS. Cluster Analysis (CA) was used to classify the investigated trace and toxic elements in terms of accumulation levels in the waters of Ergene River Basin and to classify the investigated stations in terms of contamination levels. According to the results of element analysis, Ergene River has Class II and corlu Stream has Class III water quality in terms of nickel and chromium parameters. Almost all the investigated watershed elements have Class III and Ergene River and corlu Stream have Class IV water quality in terms of selenium parameter. According to the results of elemental CA, 4 statistically significant clusters were formed, which were named as "Most intense elements", "Second most intense elements", "Moderate intense elements" and "Rarest elements".

The lake is located at the modem northern limit of the monsoon, and is therefore sensitive to the extension of the East Asian summer monsoon. Based on calibration against the instrumental record, the delta O-18(car) variation has been interpreted as changes in atmospheric circulation pattern on decadal time scales. On longer time scales, the delta O-18(carb) in lake sediments could be mainly regulated by the relative contribution of nearby (remote) water-vapor sources associated with subtropical (tropical) monsoon through changes in the distance from sources to the site of precipitation. Increased remote water vapors from tropical monsoon would lead to lighter isotope value in our study site. Through time the delta O-18(carb) record in Lake Xiarinur indicate a notable weak tropical monsoon during the Younger Dryas, a gradual increasing monsoon from the early Holocene and weakening monsoon after the middle Holocene. Oxygen isotope records from lakes and stalagmite in the Asian monsoon region across different localities show a general similar temporal pattern since the last deglaciation, and highlight a fundamental role of the tropical monsoon.

J	Gwiazda, R; Flis, A				Gwiazda, Robert; Flis, Adam			Studies of food ecology of Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo in relation to water transparency require system-adjusted data: an example from two Polish reservoirs	ARDEA												Water transparency is an important factor affecting fish availability (underwater visibility) for diving birds. The diet of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo in relation to water transparency (range 1.4-4.0 m) was studied by pellet analyses at the submontane reservoir Dobczyce, Poland, from June to November. Although water transparency proved to be related to the birds' distribution, in the range of turbidities studied, no relationship was found with either fish species and fish size taken. Of 14 species in the diet, Roach Ruhkis rutilus was dominant in all monthly samples (35-91% in 2002, 56-82% in 2004). Numbers of Great Cormorants and water transparency (range 0.4-1.4 m) were studied in the turbid lowland reservoir Goczatkowice during the migration period in autumn (August-November 2011 and 2012). Observations here suggest that the effect of water transparency on food uptake and habitat choice was only apparent below 0.6 m Secchi depth. The number of foraging Great Cormorants was not only affected by Secchi depth, but by a complex of factors (year, month, place, Secchi depth and water depth). We argue that, especially when the number of Great Cormorants is low, only highly detailed measurements of these factors (both spatially and as time series) can show the complex relationship between prey distribution, environmental conditions and the predator's behaviour.

Consequently, it is concluded that Lake Biwa is a noticeable body of water where a massive sink of silica is caused. Calculated silica sedimentation in Lake Biwa was 2.0 x 10(7) kg Si year(-1) (7.1 x 10(8) mol Si year(-1)) which is equivalent to about 80% of the annual inflow discharge of DSi to Lake Biwa. The magnitude of the sink varies seasonally by increasing in the winter holomictic stirring period, since it is greatly affected by the species composition of phytoplankton, the load of phosphorus and the condition of stratification. It seems reasonable to suppose that the DSi in Lake Biwa is removed mainly by biological processes, i.e., the assimilation of DSi by large centric diatoms and its accumulation in their frustules. Such silica sinks occur naturally in deeper stagnant waters, providing extended water residence time and supplying a certain amount of nutrients. These findings indicate that an increase in nutrient loads and abundance of stagnant water due to the construction of large dams lead to an expansion in the magnitude of the silica sink in a limnetic system.																			0168-2563					JUL	2007	84	3					285	295		10.1007/s10533-007-9115-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9115-1													WOS:000247238200004

The profile, studied by using multi-proxies (e.g., carbon isotopes, pollen analysis, palaeo and mineral magnetism and clay minerals) has recorded globally well established abrupt climatic events in the last 20,000 years, such as the LGM, Older Dryas (OD), Younger Dryas (YD), Holocene warming, 8.2 ka, and 4.2 ka events. Most events, estimated assuming a constant rate of sediment accumulation for similar lithologies, may be related to the rapid changes in the local climate and albedo structure. The ITCZ may have played a key role in controlling the behavior of the southwest monsoon from the LGM. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The age of the host made no significant difference in the mode of reinfestation of lice, fleas or mites. Flea reinfestation rates were related to the sex of the host, requiring 4 and 2 days, respectively, to reach control levels on male and female hosts. Mite populations reached the control level within 1 day, regardless of the sex of the host. No statistically significant louse reinfestations were noted within 8 days after the hosts were released. The percent of the host population reinfested with each ectoparasite followed the same patterns of reinfestation as the numbers of each parasite per host. The mode of ectoparasite reinfestation is probably a function of the behavior of the host relative to the lifestyle of the ectoparasite species.																			0090-3558	1943-3700					1980	16	4					577	586		10.7589/0090-3558-16.4.577	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-16.4.577								7463612					WOS:A1980KU71500020

Projected monthly temperature changes of the Great Lakes Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The Great Lakes Basin is an important agricultural region for both the United States and Canada. The regional crop growths are affected by inter-annual climatic conditions and intra-seasonal variability. Consequently, monthly climate change projection data can provide more useful information for crop management than seasonal climate projections. However, very few studies undertaken for the Great Lakes Basin have focused on monthly timescales. In this study, we investigate the projected mid-century (2030-2059) monthly mean maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature changes of this region, relative to the baseline period (1980-2009). Future Tmax increases in this region are likely to be greater during the May to October period (coinciding with the region's growing season) than in other months. The order of magnitude of future Tmax and Tmin changes of the five Great Lakes sub-basins are Superior > Huron > Michigan > Erie and Ontario. Most future Tmax changes over land areas are higher than those over the lakes, whereas Tmin changes are likely to be higher over lakes than over the adjacent land areas in this region. The future number of extreme warm days (Tmax >= 29-32 degrees C) in this region will increase by between about 5 days (in the north) to 40 days (in southern parts of the basin), while the number of winter cold days (Tmax <= -5 degrees C similar to 0 degrees C) may decrease by between 3 days (south) and 35 days (north). This study furthermore identifies some fluctuations of latitudinal temperature gradients in the Great Lakes Basin, these areas covering the north latitude 40.5-41.5 degrees, 43.5-44.0 degrees, 45.5-46.5 degrees, and 47.5-49.5 degrees.					; Ciborowski, Jan/AAC-8247-2019	ZHANG, LIANG/0000-0002-6063-3892; Ciborowski, Jan/0000-0002-6588-0366; Hein-Griggs, David/0000-0003-2304-2409													0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV	2018	167						453	467		10.1016/j.envres.2018.08.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.08.017								30125764					WOS:000447247500045

Meteorological conditions that lead to early thermal stratification of the lake in April are of prime importance for YCS and account for 41% of the total YCS variance. Zooplankton concentration during spring has no significant influence on YCS. The extensive stocking program on the lake (50-200 million larvae stocked per year) significantly supports YCS, but this relationship becomes apparent only after the influence meterological conditions are removed from the data. Conspecifics of age-classes 1 and 2 have a negative influence on the age 0 year-class, but the nature of this intraspecific competition remains unknown. No stock-recruitment relationship could be detected in this study. The final model includes five independent variables and accounts for 84% of the total YCS variance.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	1988	45	6					1088	1093		10.1139/f88-132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-132													WOS:A1988N930900019

Impacts of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) on benthic invertebrate fauna: a case study from the Baltic Sea	NEOBIOTA												The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) was first observed in the Baltic Sea in 1990 and has since displayed substantial secondary dispersal, establishing numerous dense populations where they may out compete native fish and negatively impact prey species. There have been multiple round goby diet studies from both the Baltic Sea and the North American Great Lakes where they are similarly invasive. However, studies that quantify their effects on recipient ecosystems and, specifically, their impacts on the benthic invertebrate macrofauna are rare, particularly from European waters. In this study, we conducted the first before-after study of the potential effects of round goby on benthic invertebrate macrofauna taxa in marine-brackish habitats in Europe, focusing of two sites in the Western Baltic Sea, Denmark. Results were in line with those from the Great Lakes, indicating negative impacts on specific molluscan taxa (e.g. Cardiidae bivalves and Neritidae gastropods, which both showed a fall in detected densities of approximately 98% within the Guldborgsund Strait). In contrast, many other groups appeared to be largely unaffected or even show positive trends following invasion. Round goby gut content data were available at one of our study sites from the period immediately after the invasion. These data confirmed that round goby had in fact been preying on the subset of taxa displaying negative trends.					; Behrens, Jane/ADK-2595-2022; Moran, Nicholas/AAX-8224-2021	Plet-Hansen, Kristian/0000-0002-6838-2063; van Deurs, Mikael/0000-0003-2368-2502; Behrens, Jane Windfeldt/0000-0002-0136-9681; Dinesen, Grete E./0000-0002-6385-1238; Moran, Nicholas/0000-0002-7331-0400; 													1619-0033	1314-2488				AUG 19	2021	68						19	30		10.3897/neobiota.68.67340	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.68.67340													WOS:000687333800001

The total biomass of the macroinvertebrates sampled during this period was 9,985.5 mg (dry weight) and 19,314 specimens were collected. Decapods (52.9 %) were the most important group regarding biomass while dipterans (21.1 %), ostracods (20.0 %), cladocerans (14.0 %), and oligochaetes (13.4 %) were the most abundant macroinvertebrates. All taxa showed frequency variations related to the high-low water cycle of Rio Negro and the substrate at the lake margins varied in quantity as well as in composition and structure. The greatest amounts of litter occurred in the flood period, with a higher proportion of new and whole leaves. The degree of litter fragmentation increased towards the low water period. The functional structure of the macroinvertebrate community showed adaptation to the available substrate in each season. A gradient of dominance between the functional categories, related to the distance from the central area of the water body, was observed. Shredders were sampled mainly inside the "igapo" (high water period), in a similar proportion to collectors. On the other hand, collectors were clearly predominant in the dry period. Scrapers were limited to the rising and falling water periods. The same trend is probably found in all the corresponding sections of the Rio Negro.

Optical properties of the ice cover on Vendyurskoe lake, Russian Karelia (1995-2012)	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Solar radiation penetrating the ice is one of the most important factors that determine the functioning of lake ecosystem in late winter. Parameterization of the attenuation of solar radiation in the snow-ice sheet is an essential tool in the study of the light regime of ice-covered lakes. The optical properties of the snow-ice sheet in Vendyurskoe lake, northwestern Russia, are investigated on the basis of long-term field observations (1995-2012). The four-layer approach (snow, white ice, slush and congelation ice) is used to study the attenuation of the downwelling planar irradiance in the snow-ice sheet. The bulk attenuation coefficients for four layers (18.8 m(-1) for snow, 6 m(-1) for white ice, 3.5 m(-1) for slush and 2.1 m(-1) for congelation ice) are calculated by the quasi-Newton method. A comparison of observed and calculated values of the irradiance beneath the ice shows that the determined coefficients adequately describe the attenuation of the downwelling irradiance by snow-ice cover.

J	Schümann, D				Schuemann, Daniel			Between Trauma and Dream: Images of Siberia in Texts by Waclaw Sieroszewski and Hanna Krall	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SLAVISCHE PHILOLOGIE												To a large extent, the contemporary image of Siberia in Polish culture evolved during the time of the Partitions. The common practice of the Tsarist regime to ban participants of the 1830-31 and 1863 insurrections, as well as politically wayward members of the intelligentsia, to Siberia and the Russian Far East affected many families of Poland's cultural elite. Many of those who were able to return to their homeland had the desire to share their traumatic experience, which often led to outbursts of creativity. As a consequence of this, during the period prior to World War I, there was an abundance of narratives, poems, songs, and paintings that aimed at boosting the spirit of Polish rebellion. In these works, the moral outrage at the regime's cruelty is usually intertwined with images of the forlorn and desolate expanses of icy, swamp-ridden Siberia. With a number of deportees developing a liking for Siberia, as well as with some banished Polish intellectuals gaining an international reputation for excellence in various fields, this Dantesque image of Siberia as Poland's Hell' came under re-evaluation in the last two decades of the 19(th) century. One of the first writers to focus on a theme other than that of Polish martyrdom in Siberia was Waclaw Sieroszewski. Banned to the regions of Lake Baikal and Yakutia, he developed a keen interest in the cultures and customs of the indigenous Siberian peoples, whom he described in both anthropological surveys and fictional writing. The present paper analyzes selected works from the diverse array of Sieroszewski's Siberia-related fiction, especially the novel Na kresach lasow [At the Frontiers of the Forests] (1894) and the narratives "W matni" ["In the Trap"] (1897) and "Jesienia" ["In Autumn"] (1884). While some of Sieroszewski's works explicitly continue the `martyrological' tradition of Polish narratives about Siberia, the aforementioned texts portray their settings as cultural spaces in their own rights. The need to re-evaluate Polish-Siberian relations arose again in 1945, when Poland became part of the Soviet hemisphere. While Sieroszewski, in spite of a monumental edition of his collected works, gradually fell into oblivion, young journalists such as Hanna Krall were sent on sponsored trips to Siberia in order to convey a new image of the Russian East in Poland. Krall, who later became famous for her artistically innovative narratives of the Shoa, is the author of three collections of travelogues recounting her Siberian experiences: "Ludzie na Syberii" ["People in Siberia"] (1974), Dojrzaloo dostepna dla wszystkich [A-Levels for Everyone] (1977), and Na wschod od Arbatu [East of Arbat Street] (2(nd) ed. 1983). While the conspicuous absence of the 'martyrological' approach to Siberia can easily be explained by the thematic constraints of media coverage in Communist Poland, Krall's attempt to create a new myth of the 'Siberian Dream' cannot be dismissed as pure Cold-War rhetoric. Her Siberia is a 'Dream Country' of the young, the innovative, and the creative, much like the myth of the American Wild West. When comparing her Siberian narratives to those of Waclaw Sieroszewski, it becomes clear that Krall's perspective on Siberia is essentially that of an outsider. In contrast, Sieroszewski's approach to Siberia is based on an insider's view of the territory which includes criticism both of Russian imperialism and of the social inequality prevailing in indigenous Siberian societies. Both Sieroszewski's and Krall's texts show (albeit unconsciously in Krall's case) the difficulties of imposing narrative control over the vast expanses of Siberia.																			0044-3492						2010	67	2					335	375																WOS:000296212000004

Prey Supply and Predation as Potential Limitations to Feasibility of Anadromous Salmonid Introductions in a Reservoir	WATER												Introducing anadromous fish upstream of migration barriers has frequently been proposed as a conservation strategy, but existing conditions and future changes to the ecosystems above barriers such as invasive species, climate change, and varying water operations influence the capacity to support such introductions. In the Upper Skagit River, Washington, USA, introduction of anadromous salmonids above three high-head dams was proposed; however, the proliferation of invasive redside shiner Richardsonius balteatus fundamentally altered reservoir food web interactions, presenting potential challenges for the growth and production of introduced anadromous salmonids. By combining empirical measurements of zooplankton availability and temporal patterns in thermal structure of the reservoir with bioenergetics model simulations to quantify the rearing capacity of Ross Lake, we estimated the lake could support millions of sockeye salmon fry entering in spring after accounting for temporal consumption demand by the existing planktivore community dominated by redside shiner. The initial fry estimates varied according to the expected fry-to-smolt survival rate, and whether salmonids would be thermally restricted from prey in the epilimnion. This translated to estimates of 189,000 to 285,000 smolts leaving the following spring, and 7700 to 11,700 returning adults, using mean fry-to-smolt and smolt-to-adult survival rates from a nearby sockeye salmon population. We also estimated that predation potential could pose substantial mortality for lake-rearing sockeye or Chinook salmon, although it is expected to play a lesser role in limiting survival of species that only migrate through the reservoir. These results provide a case study and framework for examining bottom-up and top-down food web processes that influence growth and survival of introduced anadromous salmonids in reservoir habitats, thus guiding the direction of future feasibility studies in Ross Lake and other regulated rivers where introduction programs are considered.					; Duda, Jeffrey/A-7132-2009	Johnson, Rachelle/0000-0003-1480-4088; Duda, Jeffrey/0000-0001-7431-8634														2073-4441				APR	2024	16	8							1157	10.3390/w16081157	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16081157													WOS:001210315300001

The dense summer blooms (''red tides'') were found to be nitrogen-limited. The algae's competitive advantage, however, cannot result from superior uptake capabilities: its K-s (mu mol NH4.L(-1)) for NH4 was higher and its V(max)mu mol NH4.mg chlorophyll a(-1).h(-1) was lower than other phytoplankton types commonly occurring in the region. The competitive advantage of G. bogoriense probably stems from other physiological capabilities: dark ammonia and phosphorus assimilation and the ability to undertake diel vertical migration cycles between the upper Photic water layers during the day and nutrient-rich deeper layers at night. These findings confirm the vertical nutrient retrieval hypothesis in migrating phytoplankton.					van Rijn, Jaap/Q-5254-2017	van Rijn, Jaap/0000-0002-9680-2133													0022-3646					DEC	1994	30	6					964	971		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1994.00964.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1994.00964.x													WOS:A1994QD95400008
J	Liu, L; Yang, SB				Liu, Lian; Yang, Shuai-bin			Fire history of the Chinese Loess Plateau under extreme warming scenarios: A case study of the loess-paleosol sequence L5-S5	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												In order to study the history of natural fires under warming scenarios and to evaluate the possible incidence of fires in the future, we analyzed the carbon concentration and carbon isotope composition of black carbon within the loess-paleosol sequence of the Chinese Loess Plateau. Notably, the interglacials in this East Asian monsoon region were abnormally warm. The results from the interval of L5-S5 of the studied Xifeng section suggest that the principal factors controlling natural fires in an interglacial period (S5) and a glacial period (L5) were fuel load and fuel moisture level, respectively. The difference between the carbon isotope composition of black carbon and soil organic carbon during S5LL1 (marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 14) was due to the fact that the former records the more positive carbon isotope values of C3 plants caused by drought and low temperatures in the fire season, while the latter records the carbon isotope of plants throughout the year. The optimum temperature and humidity conditions during S5SS1 (MIS 13) were the most conducive to fires during the interglacial period of S5. However, when the temperature and humidity decreased to a specific range (mean annual temperature 2-12 degrees C, mean annual precipitation 200-700 mm) during the glacial period of L5, the fire occurrence reached its highest level.																			1040-6182	1873-4553				JAN 10	2021	571						89	96		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.09.031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.09.031		JAN 2021											WOS:000612111700005
J	Mez, K; Hanselmann, K; Preisig, HR				Mez, K; Hanselmann, K; Preisig, HR			Environmental conditions in high mountain lakes containing toxic benthic cyanobacteria	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In glacial lakes on an alpine pasture in Switzerland, benthic cyanobacteria produced microcystin, a cyclic hepatotoxic heptapeptide. The cyanobacteria formed dense mats on sediments and submerged stones. The mats consisted mainly of Oscillatoria limosa, Phormidium konstantinosum (= Oscillatoria tenuis) and Tychonema granulatum (=Oscillatoria granulata). In order to characterize the ecological conditions of these cyanobacteria, nutrient concentrations were determined, and an automatic data acquisition station was installed in one of the lakes. It continuously recorded air temperature, global irradiance, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction: as well as temperature, pH, oxygen content and conductivity of the lake water. The nutrient situation in the lakes was mainly influenced by the erosion of the gneissic catchment by glacial meltwater and by precipitation. In the glacial lakes, the concentrations of calcium, iron, magnesium, sodium and sulphate increased throughout the summer season. Conductivity values of 4-110 mu S cm(-1) represent generally low nutrient concentrations. Nevertheless, iron concentrations of up to 20 mu M occurred. Biomass, expressed as protein concentration, as well as the microcystin content of the cyanobacterial mats varied within one season and between different years (1994 and 1995). In one cyanobacterial mat community, biomass and microcystin concentrations were highest at the same time, in an other one the microcystin content was maximal three weeks after the highest biomass concentration was reached. Our observations suggest that biomass and toxin production in the mats were strongly influenced by mechanical stress, temporary desiccation and high irradiation.																			0018-8158						1998	368						1	15		10.1023/A:1003224032079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003224032079													WOS:000076259700001

The response of ENSO flavors to mid-Holocene climate: Implications for proxy interpretation	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												The response of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to mid-Holocene boundary conditions remains an open question: paleoclimate proxies and climate model simulations do not agree in the magnitude of the reduction of ENSO variability, while recent proxy evidence from fossil corals from the central Pacific show that the reduction in mid-Holocene ENSO variability compared to the end of the twentieth century is not different from the reduction during other Holocene time intervals. This is inconsistent with the interpretation of lake and ocean sediment records from the eastern Pacific, which show a significant reduction compared to all other Holocene periods. In order to reconcile the seemingly conflicting proxy evidence from the eastern and central Pacific, we hypothesize that ENSO remained active during the mid-Holocene; however, there was a change in the spatial pattern of the sea surface temperature anomalies, also known as ENSO flavors. Using National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Climate System Model version 4 forced with mid-Holocene orbital conditions, we find that the frequency of occurrence of the strongest eastern Pacific (EP) events decreases in the mid-Holocene and their variance is reduced by approximate to 30%, while the frequency of central Pacific (CP) events slightly increases and their variance does not change. We also find a shift in the seasonality of EP events, but not in that of CP events. Lastly, mid-Holocene EP events develop more slowly and decay faster. The differential response of ENSO flavors to mid-Holocene forcing is remotely forced by the West Pacific, where a weakening of the trade winds in early boreal spring in the mid-Holocene initiates an anomalous downwelling annual Kelvin wave, which reaches the eastern Pacific during the ENSO development season, weakens the upper ocean stratification, and results in reduced ENSO upwelling feedback. The simulated reduction in the EP flavor versus the CP flavor in the mid-Holocene is consistent with proxy evidence: The teleconnection patterns of the two flavors with temperature, precipitation, and salinity are distinct, and proxies from different regions of the Pacific might be recording variability associated with only one of the flavors, or some combination of their relative effects.

J	Sorensen, JA; Kallemeyn, LW; Sydor, M				Sorensen, JA; Kallemeyn, LW; Sydor, M			Relationship between mercury accumulation in young-of-the-year yellow perch and water-level fluctuations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A three-year(2001-2003) monitoring effort of 14 northeastern Minnesota lakes was conducted to document relationships between water-level fluctuations and mercury bioaccumulation in young-of-the-year (YOY) yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected in the fall of each year at fixed locations. Six of those lakes are located within or adjacent to Voyageurs National Park and are influenced by dams on the outlets of Rainy and Namakan lakes. One site on Sand Point Lake coincides with a location that has nine years of previous monitoring suitable for addressing the same issue over a longer time frame. Mean mercury concentrations in YOY yellow perch at each sampling location varied significantly from year to year. For the 12-year monitoring site on Sand Point Lake, values ranged from 38 ng gww(-1) in 1998 to 200 ng gww(-1) in 2001. For the 14-lake study, annual mean concentrations ranged by nearly a factor of 2, on average, for each lake over the three years of record. One likely factor responsible for these wide variations is that annual water-level fluctuations are strongly correlated with mercury levels in YOY perch for both data sets.																			0013-936X					DEC 1	2005	39	23					9237	9243		10.1021/es050471r	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es050471r								16382948					WOS:000233712700039

Lake trout were reported to spawn historically at three of these sites-Welcome Island, Hare Island, and near the Agawa River. No lake trout eggs were found at the Welcome Island site in 1987 or 1989. Eggs were found at the Agawa site in 1989 but not in 1988. Spawning occurred at Hare Island in 1987 and 1989 but egg deposition rates were < 20 eggs m(-2). Two other sites-Sinclair Cove and No Name Shoal-were studied because lake trout catches were high in gillnets set during autumn and substrate that might be suitable for spawning was nearby. Lake trout eggs were deposited at rates up to 370 eggs m(-2) in Sinclair Cove. No eggs were found at No Name Shoal. Egg deposition greater than 20 eggs m(-2) occurred in pebble, cobble and boulder substrates that had interstices extending between 20 and 120 cm below the substrate surface. Eggs were not found in substrates < 2 mm in diameter. Lake trout abundance, inferred from gillnet catches, at these five sites did not vary directly with egg-deposition rates. The site with the highest lake trout egg-deposition, Sinclair Cove A, was comprised of mobile substrate and its location, interstitial depth, and area changed among years presumably in response to wave action.																			0380-1330						1995	21			1			202	211		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71092-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71092-9													WOS:A1995UL89400015
J	Allum, DJM; Stastna, M				Allum, Donovan J. M.; Stastna, Marek			Simulations of buoyant flows driven by variations in solar radiation beneath ice cover	PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS												Spatial variations in ice and snow characteristics imply that radiative forcing in late winter lakes is spatially heterogeneous. We present idealized, three-dimensional simulations of buoyancy-driven flows, driven in this setting with heterogeneous solar radiation intensity, comparing rectilinear and radial cases. In both cases, radiative forcing in fresh water at temperatures below 4 degrees C initiates an unstable stratification near the surface, leading to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. The variations in radiative forcing intensity generates gravity current-like flow along the surface. The resulting flow interacts with developing three-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. We provide an in-depth analysis of the development and death of the gravity current-like flow in the two cases mentioned. We find that while the interaction of this current with radiatively driven convection does create instabilities along the leading edge and slow its propagation, it is mixing with the convective and warm return flow that leads to the cessation of propagation and eventual death of the current. Differences in geometry affect the depth of the shear layer between the current and return flow, determining the timing of when propagation ends.

Ice structure is a key regulator of ice stability and thus safety, affecting activities on ice. Here, we analysed spatial and temporal variations in ice structure across 21 Swedish lakes, spanning from 55 to 69 degrees N, and over five decades. We found regional differences in ice structure, with fastest changes occurring in southern Sweden. The stable clear ice layer was particularly sensitive to warming, showing a rapid decline. The number of days when temperatures exceeded the freezing point during the ice cover period was identified as a strong driver for how ice was structured. Since there is a high risk for increased occurrences of unsafe ice conditions under predicted air temperature changes, we recommend re-establishing ice structure monitoring programmes, informing society on the increased risks of being on ice and including ice structure to safety guidelines.

Zirconium and hafnium fractionation and distribution of Rare Earth Elements in neutral-alkaline waters: Case study of Lake Van hydrothermal system, Turkey	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												We investigated the distribution of Zr, Hf, and rare earth elements (REE) as the sum of lanthanides plus Y in the hydrothermal system in the Lake Van area of south-eastern Turkey. This system is characterised by water with variable pH in alkaline conditions resulting from hydrothermal CO2 upraise and neoformation of calcite minerals in near equilibrium with the interacting waters. Zr, Hf, and REE determinations were carried out for aqueous phases and suspended solids in lake water and surrounding thermal springs. We found that dissolved Hf is partitioned relative to Zr during calcite formation and that such fractionation is a function of the Ca2+ activity in warm water. The observed Zr-Hf fractionation is explained by coulombic interactions that occur between suspended solid particles and dissolved phases at the calcite-water interface. There, the surfaces of carbonate minerals demonstrated greater reactivity towards aqueous Hf-bearing species relative to Zr-complexes. This evidence involves a coulombic mechanism of reactivity at the calcite-water interface because Hf complexes are negatively charged while Zr compounds are uncharged. Thus, authigenic calcite can behave as a suitable host for dissolved metal ion species to adsorb on crystal surfaces to remediate waste waters from mine drainage.

Foraging Ecology Differentiates Life Stages and Mercury Exposure in Common Terns (Sterna hirundo)	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												Some populations of common terns (Sterna hirundo) breeding at inland lakes in North America are declining, including the Laurentian Great Lakes. Terns nesting at inland colonies forage in freshwater during the breeding season and primarily in coastal marine environments during the nonbreeding season. As piscivores, they are susceptible to dietary Hg exposure. To characterize patterns of Hg exposure in this population, we 1) quantified within and among season differences in total mercury (THg) concentrations (mu g/g) in blood and feathers at 2 Lake Superior breeding colonies, and 2) documented spatial and temporal variation in exposure by studying adult foraging ecology using geospatial tracking devices and stable isotopes. We used general linear models to assess the relationship between isotopic composition and THg concentrations in bird tissues relative to sex, age, colony location, and season. The THg concentrations were lowest in winter-grown feathers (geometric mean [95% confidence limits]): 1.32 (1.09-1.59) mu g/g dw (n = 60), higher at the more industrially influenced colony (chick feathers: 4.95 [4.62-5.37] mu g/g dw [n = 20]), and increased with a riverine-based diet. During the breeding season, Hg exposure varied along a gradient from lake to river, with adult females having lower blood THg concentrations than males (females: 0.83 [0.67-1.03]) mu g/g ww (n = 7); males: 1.15 (0.92-1.45) mu g/g ww (n = 5). Stable isotope values suggested adults obtained 42 +/- 12% (n = 12) of their diet from the river during incubation, which was validated with tracking data. During chick-rearing, chicks obtained 68 +/- 19% (n = 44) of their diet from the river. Our results indicate colony location, foraging behavior, and season influenced Hg exposure for these Lake Superior colonies and underscores the importance of local contamination with respect to exposure.

An advance of the term of decline of ice cover was determined (by 2.5 day.dec(-1)on average for all lakes), as well as a reduction of duration of ice cover (by 4.4 day.dec(-1) on average for all lakes), and a decrease in its maximum thickness (by 2 cm.dec(-1) on average for all lakes).

Use of river-wetland habitats in a declining population of the terrapin (Mauremys rivulata) along the Strymon River, northern Greece	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												A declining population of the freshwater turtle Mauremys rivulata (Chelonia, Geoemydidae) living in a human-impacted area along the Strymon River, just upstream from Kerkini Lake (Prefecture of Serres, northern Greece), was investigated by capture-recapture and radio-tracking. Fyke nets placed along the river and in ponds lying on the riparian lowland gave about 2000 catches in 6 years, permitting us to assess major inter-habitat movements during ontogenesis and throughout the seasons. Annual intensive radio-tracking of 15 females and 10 males gave finer details of movement patterns between different river-wetland habitats. Younger specimens, including yearlings, inhabited the ponds almost exclusively, whereas the adult population shifted seasonally from the ponds during the mating season to a marsh area lying on the opposite side of the river for aestivation and overwintering. The river served mainly as a corridor for transit between the two habitats. Moreover, longitudinal movements along the river were observed, particularly in the males, which probably allow dispersal and gene flow between subpopulations living in the area. One major threat to the viability of M. rivulata in the study area is the diversion of water for irrigation during the summer, drying up the Strymon completely, which reduces the water level in the ponds. Livestock crossing the area for grazing and watering in the ponds is also of impact, as turtles in the ponds are trampled on and nests are disturbed.

Cyanobacterial Blooms and their Toxicity in Vojvodina Lakes, Serbia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The presence of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) is a significant indicator of water quality, having in mind that several genera have the quality of producing cyanotoxins, which are harmful to animals, plants and humans. Seven lakes in Vojvodina (Republic of Serbia) were examined in May and September 2007 for cyanobacterial presence and cyanotoxins content, Chl a concentration and index of phosphatase activity as the indicators of water quality. In the spring period, cyanobacteria species were not dominant in only 2 of 14 water samples. Microcystins were detected in all of the lakes examined. The concentrations of microcystins ranged from 6.66 mu g/L (Provala Lake) to 199.9 and 238 mu g/L (Palic and Ludas Lake respectively).The investigations conducted on 7 water ecosystems in Vojvodina, regarding the basic parameters of eutrophication, Chl a concentration and phosphatase activity index, have rendered the examined ecosystems immensely endangered due to significant water quality deterioration. It was determined that the intensification of eutrophication processes has been linked to the increased presence and abundance of cyanobacteria as well as significant toxin production.

J	Kaasalainen, H; Stefánsson, A				Kaasalainen, Hanna; Stefansson, Andri			Sulfur speciation in natural hydrothermal waters, Iceland	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The speciation of aqueous dissolved sulfur was determined in hydrothermal waters in Iceland. The waters sampled included hot springs, acid-sulfate pools and mud pots, sub-boiling well discharges and two-phase wells. The water temperatures ranged from 4 to 210 degrees C, the pH(T) was between 2.20 and 9.30 at the discharge temperature and the SO4 and Cl concentrations were 0.020-52.7 and <0.01-10.0 mmol kg(-1), respectively. The analyses were carried out on-site within similar to 10 min of sampling using ion chromatography (IC) for sulfate (SO42-), thiosulfate (S2O32-) and polythionates (SxO62-) and titration and/or colorimetry for total dissolved sulfide (S2-). Sulfite (SO32-) could also be determined in a few cases using IC. Alternatively, for few samples in remote locations the sulfur oxyanions were stabilized on a resin on site following elution and analysis by IC in the laboratory. Dissolved sulfate and with few exceptions also S2- were detected in all samples with concentrations of 0.02-52.7 mmol kg(-1) and <1-4100 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. Thiosulfate was detected in 49 samples of the 73 analyzed with concentrations in the range of <1-394 mu mol kg(-1) (S-equivalents). Sulfite was detected in few samples with concentrations in the range of <1-3 mu mol kg(-1). Thiosulfate and SO32- were not detected in < 100 degrees C well waters and S2O32- was observed only at low concentrations (< 1-8 mu mol kg(-1)) in similar to 200 degrees C well waters. In alkaline and neutral pH hot springs, S2O32- was present in significant concentrations sometimes corresponding to up to 23% of total dissolved sulfur (S-TOT). In steam-heated acid-sulfate waters, S2O32- was not a significant sulfur species. The results demonstrate that S2O32- and SO32- do not occur in the deeper parts of < 150 degrees C hydrothermal systems and only in trace concentrations in similar to 200-300 degrees C systems. Upon ascent to the surface and mixing with oxygenated ground and surface waters and/or dissolution of atmospheric O-2, S2- is degassed and oxidized to SO32- and S2O32- and eventually to SO42- at pH > 8. In near-neutral hydrothermal waters the oxidation of S2- and the interaction of S2- and S-0 resulting in the formation of S-x(2-) are considered important. At lower pH values the reactions seemed to proceed relatively rapidly to SO42- and the sulfur chemistry of acid-sulfate pools was dominated by SO42-, which corresponded to >99% of S-TOT. The results suggest that the aqueous speciation of sulfur in natural hydrothermal waters is dynamic and both kinetically and source-controlled and cannot be estimated from thermodynamic speciation calculations.

Forests, however, are mainly confined to the eastern Tibetan Plateau. On the central Tibetan Plateau, in contrast, shrubs and dwarf shrubs need to be studied instead of trees as a source of climate information. The objectives of this study were to check the dendrochronological potential of the dwarf shrub Wilson juniper (Juniperus pingii var. wilsonii) growing from 4740 to 4780 m a.s.l. and to identify the climatic factors controlling its radial growth. Forty-three discs from 33 stems of Wilson juniper were sampled near the north-eastern shore of the Nam Co (Heavenly Lake). Cross-dating was performed along two directions of each stem, avoiding the compression-wood side as far as possible. A ring-width chronology was developed after a negative exponential function or a straight line of any slope had been fit to the raw measurements. Then, correlations were calculated between the standard ring-width chronology and monthly climate data recorded by a weather station around 100 km away. Our study has shown high dendrochronological potential of Wilson juniper, based on its longevity (one individual was 324 years old), well-defined growth rings, reliable cross-dating between individuals and distinct climatic signals reflected by the ring-width variability. Unlike dwarf shrubs in the circum-arctic tundra ecosystem which positively responded to above-average temperature in the growing season, moisture turned out to be growth limiting for Wilson juniper, particularly the loss of moisture caused by high maximum temperatures in MayJune. Because of the wide distribution of shrub and dwarf shrub species on the central Tibetan Plateau, an exciting prospect was opened up to extend the presently existing tree-ring networks far up into one of the largest tundra regions of the world.					; Ren, Ping/AAB-1474-2021; Liang, Eryuan/A-1435-2010; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022	Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; Li, Xiaoxia/0000-0002-7241-4785; Liang, Eryuan/0000-0002-8003-4264; 													0305-7364	1095-8290				MAR	2012	109	4					721	728		10.1093/aob/mcr315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcr315								22210848					WOS:000300731500004

The testicular and ovarian cycles and reproductive hormone levels of these morphotypes were determined from May to October in populations east and west of the Keweenaw Peninsula in southern Lake Superior. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) increased from August to October for lean and siscowet males and females east of the Keweenaw Peninsula and for siscowets west of the Keweenaw Peninsula. Circulating estradiol-17 beta (E2) levels and ovarian GSIs increased simultaneously in females of both morphotypes. However, circulating 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) levels in lean and siscowet males were not significantly elevated until October even though testicular GSIs increased by August. Transcripts of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) beta subunit (an indirect measure of FSH activity) increased in lean and siscowet males and females during August and September, when GSIs were increasing for both morphotypes. The seasonal changes in GSIs and hormone levels indicate that both lean and siscowet individuals in southern Lake Superior populations undergo reproductive maturation at the same time in the fall; therefore, reproductive timing does not appear to genetically isolate the morphotypes in these populations. A proportion of the sampled females (lean lake trout: 54%; siscowets: 42%) exhibited no increase in GSI from August to October, strongly suggesting that in any given year some proportion of the population does not reproduce. This was also observed in males but at a lower percentage (19-20%). Fish that did not have maturing gonads from August to October also had lower E2 and 11-KT levels than maturing fish. Fecundity measured for lean and siscowet lake trout was not statistically different and was similar to historical values.

Here we present a sedimentary record from the central Tibetan Plateau to investigate the impacts of climate and human activities on alpine vegetation during the late Holocene, based on a 162-cm-long lacustrine sediment core collected from Tangra Yumco. Palynology, charcoal and minerogenic input reveal variations of climate and human activity during the past 3400 cal yr BP. Our results show that alpine steppe dominated by Artemisia, Cyperaceae and Poaceae was present in the Tangra Yumco area during the entire covered period. Only minor human activities are visible between 3400 and 2300 as well as from 1700 to 400 cal yr BP, when vegetation was mainly influenced by climate. Although human activities (presence/grazing) became more intensive between 2300 and 1700 cal yr BP corresponding to the Zhang Zhung Kingdom, vegetation change is still mainly affected by a more arid climate. Strongest human influence on vegetation was found after 400 cal yr BP, when vegetation composition was altered by farming and grazing activities. Our records indicate human activities did not have significant impacts on alpine environment until the past few centuries at Tangra Yumco on the central Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

River to the flood of July 1996 in the Saguenay Region of Quebec: Large-scale avulsion in a glaciated valley	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Modifications to valley form due to extreme flooding in the lower 34 km of the Ha! Ha! River were analyzed. Heavy regional precipitation in July 1996 triggered extreme runoff and the catastrophic drainage of Ha! Ha! Lake, producing discharges of 1100 m(3)/s, 8 times the 100-year flood. Dominant valley modifications, revealed by comparing preflood and postflood topographies derived photogrammetrically, were related to two large-scale avulsions; in particular, a deep retrogressive incision which bypassed the 30-m-high Perron Falls, exporting 6 x 10(6) m(3) of glacial stratified drift from a 2-km section of valley and producing massive sedimentation in the reach downstream. Reconstructed maximum flow power values support the existence of a 300 W/m(2) threshold for major scouring of the alluvial valley bottom. The evidence highlights the potential for massive scour and fill and reorganization of the long profile, with potentially catastrophic effects on infrastructure, during extreme floods in glaciated valley settings.																			0043-1397					SEP	1998	34	9					2383	2392		10.1029/98WR01550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/98WR01550													WOS:000075674800026

In 2000, studies were continued with removal of 204 kg ha(-1) of fish and restocking with 134 kg ha(-1) of cyprinids. The removal of about 50% of cyprinid had a quite considerable impact on almost all of the observed parameters. Summer mean chlorophyll a values in 2000 decreased by 43%, phytoplankton community changed from being dominated by filamentous blue-greens causing blooms in 1999 to a much more diverse community with, e.g., green algae, dinoflagellates and cryptomonads in the year following fish removal. The zooplankton community showed the typical composition of lakes with very high predation pressure of omnivorous cyprinid fish leading to a decrease in both mean body length and fecundity of daphnids.

Meteorology influencing springtime air quality, pollution transport, and visibility in Korea	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												In an environment with many local, remote, persistent, and episodic sources of pollution, meteorology is the primary factor that drives periods of unhealthy air quality and reduced visibility. The 2016 Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) field study provides a unique opportunity to examine the impact of meteorology on the relative influence of local and transboundary pollution. Much of the KORUS-AQ campaign can be grouped into four distinct research periods based on observed synoptic meteorology, including a period of complex aerosol vertical profiles driven by dynamic meteorology, stagnation under a persistent anticyclone, low-level transport and haze development, and a blocking pattern. These episodes are examined using a diverse archive of ground, airborne, and satellite data. While frontal boundaries are recognized as the primary mechanism driving pollution transport in eastern Asia, results show that they are not always related to sustained periods of hazardous air quality and reduced visibility at the surface. Significant long-range transport of pollution and dust was constrained to a few short events, suggesting that the majority of pollutants sampled during KORUS-AQ originated from local sources. A severe regional pollution episode is examined in detail, featuring dense haze and significant secondary particle formation within a shallow moist boundary layer. Observations during KORUS-AQ also highlight a rapid, 40 ppbv increase in ozone pollution as a strong sea breeze front traversed the Seoul Metropolitan Area. Representativeness of meteorology and pollution conditions measured by KORUS-AQ is considered by comparison with climatology. This analysis is an essential step toward improved local and regional forecasting of air quality and visibility.

Although the lake drained spontaneously the next day, it caused nationwide concern and triggered emergency responses. We identified the primary flood trigger as a massive rockfall from the northwest face of Saldim Peak (6388m) which fell approximately 570m down to the unnamed glacier above Langmale glacial lake, causing a massive dust cloud and hurricane-force winds. The impact also precipitated an avalanche, carrying blocks of rock and ice up to 5m in diameter that plummeted a further 630m down into Langmale glacial lake, triggering a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). The flood carved steep canyons, scoured the river's riparian zone free of vegetation, and deposited sediment, debris, and boulders throughout much of the river channel from the settlement of Langmale to the settlement of Yangle Kharka about 6.5km downstream. Peak discharge was estimated at 4400 +/- 1800m(3)s(-1), and total flood volume was estimated at 1.3x10(6)m(3) of water. This study highlights the importance of conducting integrated field studies of recent catastrophic events as soon as possible after they occur, in order to best understand the complexity of their triggering mechanisms, resultant impacts, and risk reduction management options.

The suspended solids concentration in the lake determines the attenuation of light. A 2-dimensional sediment transport model, STRESS-2d, was used to estimate the spacial distribution of the silt content for periods with different wind conditions. The model was calibrated using measured values of the fall velocity distributions of sediment, freshly deposited material and suspended solids. The specific light attenuation coefficient of the various sediment classes was also measured and used in the light attenuation model, CLEAR, together with simulation results from the STRESS-2d model, to simulate the light attenuation variations in time and space. By comparison of the simulation results for different scenarios, the influence of regional planning features on the sediment balance and the light attenuation can quantified. A provisional example of this method is presented.																			0018-8158					JUL 17	1992	235						167	176		10.1007/BF00026209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026209													WOS:A1992JM30800015

Heteroptera (Insecta: Hemiptera) of the peat bogs of Belarusian Lakeland	BIOLOGIA												The first overview on the Heteroptera of peat bogs of the Belarusian Lakeland is presented. Five natural oligotrophic peat bogs were studied in 2012-2014 by entomological sweep-net. A total of almost 2,612 true bugs were sampled, representing 83 species of 13 families. Ten species (12.11-36.72% of the individuals) were tyrphobiontic or tyrphophilous. The five most abundant species represented 71.39-82.30% of the individuals. The most common species were Stictopleurus crassicornis (14.56-59.63%) and Stephanitis oberti (10.25-36.21%). The number of individuals of adult Heteroptera in peat bogs was low in spring and high in July-August. The natural peat bog offered favorable conditions to phytophagous (72.29%) polyphagous (60.00%) true bugs species. The most preferred host plants were ericales shrubs.					; Sushko, Gennadi/AAE-7730-2020	Sushko, Gennadi/0000-0003-1354-4413; 													0006-3088	1336-9563				JUN	2016	71	6					688	694		10.1515/biolog-2016-0085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-0085													WOS:000380738200012

In such an assessment, the sensitivity of Lake Ohrid (Macedonia/Albania; surface area A = 358 km(2), volume V = 55 km(3), > 200 endemic species) to three major human impacts-water abstraction, eutrophication, and global warming-is evaluated. It is shown that ongoing eutrophication presents the major threat to this unique lake system, even under the conservative assumption of an increase in phosphorus (P) concentration from the current 4.5 to a potential future 9 mg P m(-3). Eutrophication would lead to a significant reduction in light penetration, which is a prerequisite for endemic, deep living plankton communities. Moreover, a P increase to 9 mg P m(-3) would create deep water anoxia through elevated oxygen consumption and increase in the water column stability due to more mineralization of organic material. Such anoxic conditions would severely threaten the endemic bottom fauna. The trend toward anoxia is further amplified by the predicted global warming of 0.04 degrees C yr(-1), which significantly reduces the frequency of complete seasonal deep convective mixing compared to the current warming of 0.006 degrees C yr(-1). This reduction in deep water exchange is triggered by the warming process rather than by overall higher temperatures in the lake. In contrast, deep convective mixing would be even more frequent than today under a higher temperature equilibrium, as a result of the temperature dependence of the thermal expansivity of water. Although water abstraction may change local habitats, e.g., karst spring areas, its effects on overall lake properties was shown to be of minor importance.

J	Kadlec, RH				Kadlec, Robert H.			Wastewater treatment at the Houghton Lake wetland: Hydrology and water quality	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Lagoon-treated wastewater was discharged to a natural peatland to remove nutrients. For thirty consecutive years, an average of 600,000 m(3) of treated water was discharged to the Porter Ranch peatland near the community of Houghton Lake, Michigan. This discharge was seasonal, commencing no sooner than May 1 and ending no later than October 31. During the winter half-year, treated wastewater was stored at the lagoon site. This water contained 3.5 mg/L of total phosphorus, and 7 mg/L of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Other wastewater quality parameters were CBOD5 = 15 mg/L, TSS = 34 mg/L, and fecal coliforms at 66 cfu/100 ml. The peatland was large, about 700 ha, but the zone that provided wastewater polishing was approximately 100 ha. Outflows from the larger peatland showed no effects of the discharge, and maintained concentrations of 40 mu g/L of phosphorus, and 85 mu g/L of ammonia nitrogen. Nutrients were stored in the 100-ha irrigation area, which removed 94% of the phosphorus (53 metric tons) and 95% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen. All other constituents were also removed in the irrigation area, except for pass-through substances such as chloride. Phosphorus was stored in new biomass, increased soil sorption, and accretion of new soils and sediments, the last being dominant. A simple growth and uptake model described the removal of phosphorus, with an uptake rate coefficient that did not change over time. Thus, rates in this system were stable over time, and the P-removal capacity did not diminish. The irrigation area underwent large changes in ecosystem structure. There was an initial fertilizer response, characterized by much larger standing crops of vegetation. There was also a plant community shift, from the initial sedge-willow cover type to a cattail-dominant cover type. This new cattail patch became a floating mat. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The carbonate percentage and ostracode abundance show a consistent pattern with similar to 200-year moisture oscillations during the last 1000 years. The moisture pattern in the Qaidam Basin is in opposite relation to tree-ring-based monsoon precipitations in the surrounding mountains, suggesting that topography may be important in controlling regional moisture patterns as mediated by rising and subsiding air masses in this topographically-complex region. Cross-spectral analysis between our moisture proxies and solar activity proxy shows high coherence at the similar to 200-year periodicity which is similar to Chinese monsoon intensity records, implying the possible solar forcing of moisture oscillations in the NE Tibetan Plateau.

S) to assess the magnitude and seasonality of N or P limitation of algal growth. P appeared to be in abundant supply relative to growth requirements throughout 1982. Alkaline phosphatase levels were low (< 3 nmol substrate converted .cntdot. .mu.g-1 Chl a [chlorophyll a] .cntdot. l-1), 32PO43- turnover times were always long (> 103 min in the main body of the lake), and little or no P was accumulated by the seston during short-term enrichments. NH4+ enhancement assays suggested a persistent cellular shortage of N throughout all seasons in the plankton of a large shallow bay, and in the main basin when the water was stratified. High NH4+ uptake capacities, as measured with the NH4+ analog [14C]methylammonium, and selective accumulation of N from N plus P enrichments provided supportive evidence of cellular N deficiency. Winter mixing brought large quantities of NO3- and SRP into the surface euphotic zone of the main basin, and throughout this period neither N nor P appeared to be limiting. Polymixis in the shallow bay resulted in large variations in N supply and deficiency, and these effects were modulated in part by changes in depth of the euphotic zone. N was always in low abundance relative to P in Lake Titicaca, but the extent of nutrient control on algal growth varied considerably with site and time of year.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019; Lovejoy, Connie/A-3756-2008; Wurtsbaugh, Wayne/G-6856-2011	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Lovejoy, Connie/0000-0001-8027-2281; 													0024-3590	1939-5590					1984	29	3					540	552		10.4319/lo.1984.29.3.0540	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1984.29.3.0540													WOS:A1984SX74500008

This study reports the results of control trials on an introduced fish assemblage (Salmo trutta [brown trout], Perca fluviatilus [Eurasian perch], and Scardinius erythropthalmus [common rudd]) in a small lagoon in the lower North Island. The trials indicated that repeated netting was an effective means of suppressing introduced fish biomass and could potentially result in eradication if the lagoon was closed off to immigration from the adjacent lake. Increases in native fish density and diversity during the control trials indicated that the reduction in introduced fish biomass could have alleviated predation pressure on these species. In addition perch, and to a lesser degree rudd, completed regular spawning migrations into the lagoon from the lake during spring, providing opportunities for strategic control in the future.																			1543-4060	1543-4079				JUN	2019	37	2					90	100		10.3368/er.37.2.90	http://dx.doi.org/10.3368/er.37.2.90													WOS:000467981600007

Convective cells in snow clouds were observed by two Doppler radars over Ishikari Bay, Hokkaido, Japan, during winter monsoon surges. Seven cells that allowed us to examine structural changes were selected for the investigation. From the time series of maximum reflectivity and vertical mass flux in each cell, the analyzed cells were classified into two groups: "rapid change" and "slow change." The former was further divided into two types according to the strength of vertical wind shear in the environment: rapid change in weak shear (Rw), and rapid change in strong shear (Rs). The structure of the Rw-type changed greatly, due to the formation and the descent of a high-reflectivity core (> 30 dBZ), and the subsequent dissipation of the updraft. Since the updraft hardly tilted and collapsed when the core descended in the updraft, loading by graupel particles was suggested to be effective to terminate the updraft. The structure of the Rs-type changed greatly due to the short lifetime of the updraft that was tilted toward the downshear side due to the strong vertical shear. In contrast, the cell of slow-change group (S-type) maintained its structure because of a persistent updraft. Since the updraft, which was tilted hardly, was sustained even when a core (less than or equal to 30 dBZ) descended in the updraft region, the loading effect was thought to be small due to the small amount of graupel particles. From a comparison of the three types, it was found that the different features of the cell's structure were caused by two factors: the tilt of the updraft, and the effect of loading by graupel particles. Based on these results, we discussed the maintenance process of a snow cloud composed of convective cells. The fact that convective cells in the past observational studies can also be classified in the same way as cells analyzed in the present study, was also discussed. The relationship between the growth of graupel particles, and the temperature in the environment, was also discussed.					ueda, hiroshi/P-9078-2014; Maki, Masayuki/NQF-8798-2025														0026-1165					FEB	2004	82	1					179	206		10.2151/jmsj.82.179	http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj.82.179													WOS:000221340300011

Razorback Sucker Movement Strategies across a River-Reservoir Habitat Complex	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Razorback SuckerXyrauchen texanusoccur in reservoir and riverine habitats in the Colorado River basin, with some individuals aggregating at river-reservoir inflows. To assess use of inflow areas and potential environmental correlates with fish movement among reservoir and river habitats, we used a passive receiver array to monitor location and movements (n = 69) and depth (n = 19) of acoustic- and PIT-tagged fish in Lake Powell from April 2018 to March 2019. Acoustic receivers were deployed along 18 km of the San Juan River-Lake Powell inflow area, and a PIT tag antenna was deployed below a waterfall that impedes all upstream movement approximately 30 km upstream of the inflow area. Fish were detected moving between the inflow area and the river in all seasons except winter. Fifty-eight percent of fish moved from the reservoir and were detected upstream at the waterfall, while 42% of fish appeared to remain within the reservoir. These reservoir-resident fish moved long distances (hundreds of kilometers) but had relatively small linear home ranges (<18 km). On average, fish moved farthest and home range size was largest from April to September, and seasonal differences corresponded with differences in the number of fish detected. River discharge was relatively constant, and monthly distance moved was positively correlated with monthly river temperature, suggesting temperature alone might cue movements. Fish were detected at depths of 5.7 m but generally remained in shallow water (<2 m). Causal mechanisms that drive habitat use by adult fish are unclear but likely involve intraspecific differences in response to resource needs. We hypothesize that reservoirs provide warmer temperatures for longer periods of the year relative to regulated rivers, which might benefit warmwater fishes. Understanding the importance of movement among river and reservoir habitats might further conservation efforts by encouraging inclusion of reservoir habitats in management plans.

Accounting for littoral primary production by periphyton shifts a highly humic boreal lake towards net autotrophy	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The prevailing view that many humic lakes are net heterotrophic is commonly based on pelagic measurements alone. Poor light conditions in humic lakes are assumed to constrain littoral primary production (PP), such that the littoral zone has been considered an insignificant contributor to whole-lake PP. However, that assumption is based on models and inferences from pelagic processes which do not take littoral zone structure into account. Many lakes have an extensive ring of aquatic vegetation lying near the water surface, which provides substratum for epiphytic algae under well-illuminated conditions. We measured both pelagic and littoral PP and community respiration (CR) in Mekkojarvi, a small, highly humic headwater lake, in southern Finland throughout the open water season in 2012. We used a C-14 incorporation technique to measure pelagic PP, while littoral PP was determined using changes in dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations during insitu incubations. We then estimated whole-lake PP and CR for both the littoral and pelagic zones. We found that littoral PP usually dominated whole-lake PP, contributing >90% to total PP in summer. A mean pelagic production to respiration ratio (GPP:CR) of 0.4 clearly indicated strong net heterotrophy, but a value of 2.2 for the littoral zone indicated strong autotrophy. For both habitats combined, the mean whole lake GPP:CR was 1.6, indicating net autotrophy. We suggest that littoral PP can contribute significantly to whole-lake PP even in highly humic lakes, and that the littoral contribution can shift some lakes which have been considered net heterotrophic to metabolic balance or even net autotrophy during the ice-free period. Small humic lakes like Mekkojarvi with rings of littoral vegetation are widespread, especially in the boreal zone, and at least for similar lakes, evaluating lake metabolism from pelagic measurements alone is likely to be misleading.

J	Nicoll, K				Nicoll, Kathleen			A revised chronology for Pleistocene paleolakes and Middle Stone Age - Middle Paleolithic cultural activity at Bir Tirfawi - Bir Sahara in the Egyptian Sahara	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					19th INQUA Congress on Quaternary Perspectives on Climate Change, Natural Hazards and Civilization / SEQS Session	2015	Nagoya, JAPAN					At Bir Tirfawi and Bir Sahara in the now hyperarid Egyptian Sahara, relict lake deposits located in adjacent deflation basins near 22 degrees 54'57.58 '' N 28 degrees 50'19.54 '' E preserve evidence of different hydroclimate conditions that enabled cultural activities during the Middle Stone Age - Middle Paleolithic (MSA-MP). Single aliquot regeneration optically stimulated luminescence (SAR-OSL) dating techniques were applied to sediment samples with archaeological contexts to generate a more precise geochronology for the groundwater-supported lakes and prehistoric activities in the region. New age determinations on nine samples collected from Bir Sahara East and Bir Tirfawi are presented for the five paleolake phases originally described by the excavation team. The new analyses yielded dates that are more precise, and refine the original geochronology for water availability at this location. The determinations suggest that some of the originally defined lake phases are temporally indistinct. SAR-OSL dates of the West 2 and West 3 lake phases defined at Bir Sahara East overlap in time, and are contemporaneous with the Grey 3 phase at Bir Tirfawi, at around 102 ka. The refined age for the Grey 1 phase at Bir Tirfawi dates to 135 +/- 21.6 ka, and two dates for the Post-Lake phase at Bir Sahara center around 41 ka. A probability distribution plot (pdf) of all nine of the analytical results resolves the chronology of groundwater-supported paleolakes and prehistoric activities in the region around 41 ka (MIS 3), 80 ka (MIS 5a), 102 (MIS 5c-d), and 115 ka (MIS 5d-e). Precise dates for the sediments at these archaeological sites are important for several lines of multidisciplinary inquiry, including the role of Middle-Late Pleistocene climate on landscape change and water availability, variations in material culture and the adaptations in populations of anatomically modern humans (AMH) in the Sahara. Research in the Bir Sahara - Bir Tirfawi region is particularly interesting because the sites are within the modern hyperarid core of NE Africa, and are not located along the coasts or major waterway corridors "Out of Africa" like the Nile Valley. Semi-permanent paleolakes and long-lived spring-fed oases located in the modern arid belt west of the River Nile between Egypt and Sudan were crucial biomes for sustaining the lifeways and dispersal of Homo throughout the Quaternary. However, the importance and the role of such ecosystems dispersed across the North African landscape is somewhat underestimated in existing hypotheses that aim to describe hominin adaptation and dispersals.

Effects of Reservoir Levels on Arizona National Recreation Area Visitation, Visitor Spending, and Local Economies	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This study estimates the effects of reservoir levels on demand for recreation visits to Lake Powell (Glen Canyon National Recreation Area [NRA]) and Lake Mead NRA, correlating reservoir levels with overnight and total recreation visits. We also consider the effects of closures of recreation access points (such as launch ramps or marinas) when lake levels fall below critical thresholds. Our overall results are similar to past studies, but find that the access point closures are a more robust predictor of visits than simple elevation measures. Policies that manage the Colorado River, including those that seek to maintain reservoir levels above critical levels with the primary goal of preventing water delivery cutbacks, also affect recreation demand and the economies of nearby communities. Our analysis maps changes in visits (from changing elevations) to changes in visitor spending, recreationist user benefits, and regional economic indicators such as value added and employment. Such indicators could be used in future benefit-cost or economic impact analyses of Colorado River water management policies.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2022	58	5					622	638		10.1111/1752-1688.12962	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12962		OCT 2021											WOS:000712955300001

In terms of the spacetime distribution the highest density of rotifers was noted in the summer period (average 386 ind/l, relative annual abundance 62%), and in the epilimnetic layer (average 309 ind/l, relative annual abundance 58%). A total of 41 rotifer taxa belonging to 22 genera and 14 families were identified. Three rotifer species: Gastropus stylifer, Synchaeta tremula and Trichocerca birostris were dominant and perennial during the annual investigation. Pearson's product-moment correlations and canonical correlation analysis suggest that temperature, pH values, alkalinity, chemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll a concentration significantly influenced rotifer density. According to rotifer food collection and selection, in Visovac Lake macrofilter-feeders predominated, and microfilter-feeders were in a minority.

The sampling site is at a depth of 100 m, with temperatures of 2 to 4 degreesC year-round. RNA extracted from sediment was probed with radiolabeled oligonucleotides targeting bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic SSU rRNAs, as well as with a universal probe. The coverage of these probes in relation to the present sequence database is discussed. Because ribosome production is growth rate regulated, rRNA concentrations are an indicator of the microbial populations active in situ. Over a 1-year period, changes in sedimentary SSU rRNA concentrations followed seasonal changes in surface water temperature and SSU rRNA concentration. Sedimentary depth profiles of oxygen, reduced manganese and iron, and sulfate changed relatively little from season to season, but the nitrate concentration was approximately fivefold higher in April and June 1997 than at the other times sampling was done. We propose that sediment microbial SSU rRNA concentrations at our sampling site are influenced by seasonal inputs from the water column, particularly the settling of the spring diatom bloom, and that the timing of this input may be modulated by grazers, such that ammonia becomes available to sediment microbes sooner than fresh organic carbon. Nitrate production from ammonia by autotrophic nitrifying bacteria, combined with low activity of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria in the absence of readily degradable organic carbon, could account for the cooccurrence of high nitrate and low SSU rRNA concentrations.

J	Arheimer, B; Andersson, L; Lepisto, A				Arheimer, B; Andersson, L; Lepisto, A			Variation of nitrogen concentration in forest streams influences of flow, seasonality and catchment characteristics	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Short-term variation of nitrogen concentrations must be considered when assessing longterm changes in forest ecosystems, and calculating accurate estimates of nitrogen export. In this study, 10 years of monthly concentration and daily flow measurements from 20 small forested catchments in Sweden and Finland were used to link concentrations to flow dynamics and/or seasonal variations, and to relate the detected links to catchment characteristics. The methods used included regression analyses and the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Significant correlations between different nitrogen fractions and flow volume were found for most of the catchments, but in general flow volume only explained 20% of the variation in NO3-N and organic-N, and 10% of the variation in NH4-N concentrations. Both positive and negative correlations between concentration and flow were detected for the inorganic-N fractions, whereas for organic-N only positive correlations were recorded. Increasing flow conditions were often found to be associated with twofold median inorganic-N concentrations, especially during the spring. However, the most extreme seasonal variation was associated with the influence of the growing season, showing up to 20 times lower inorganic-N concentrations. Regarding NO3-N concentrations, high atmospheric nitrogen deposition appeared to moderate this seasonal influence whereas it was highest for catchments including lakes. Intensively drained catchments showed the quantitatively largest difference between growing and dormant seasons for NH4-N concentrations. In general, links between nitrogen concentrations and flow/seasons could be related to annual mean temperature, annual mean concentrations and the water regime of the catchments. The geographical heterogeneity of detected links and the still rather low explanation level for the concentration variation, show the importance of a more dynamic approach to nitrogen leakage where also catchment characteristics are included.

A pollen record from the early Priabonian to the late Aquitanian encompassing the EOT was produced for thirty-three locations in Southeastern France. Changes in lowland flora and vegetation were documented based on the shift from dense forests with tropical-subtropical plants to open shrublands rich in xeric plants, paving the way for the future Mediterranean landscapes. Cupressaceae, particularly Tetraclinis, and Ephedra, occupied a proeminent place in the newly structured vegetation. Palaeolimatic fluctuations were quantified using the Climatic Amplitude Method, revealing the fact that the EOT was mainly characterized by a decrease of 7-9 degrees C in winter temperatures and by an increase in overall temperature and rainfall seasonality. Using the climatostratigraphic approach further improved the regional chronostratigraphy. This climate change occurred during a period and in a region marked by an extensive geodynamic upheaval. This work documents the pathways of some influential marine incursions of the Mediterranean Sea earlier than is usually considered. Finally, the deposition of evaporites in lakes is interpreted as the result of a combination of different factors, including the entrance of marine waters in the terrestrial realm, a decrease in regional rainfall, a decrease in the supply of water by rivers and increased seasonality. Palaeoelevations of nearby mountains were also estimated using pollen grains transported from highlands and reconstructed palaeotemperature of the lowlands.

To investigate the relative effects of periodic environmental changes on their inshore migration and ascending behavior from the bottom to swim with flood tidal currents, year-round collections were carried out from December 2003 to December 2005 inside Hamana Lake, Japan, where strong tidal flows occur. Glass eel collections (N = 543) near the inlet to the lake indicated that recruitment occurred mainly in winter from November to May. Time-series autocorrelation analysis of average daily catch rates found negative autocorrelation coefficients at 16-20 days periodicities and positive ones at 30-32 days periodicities in the 2004-2005 season, suggesting that the amount of recruiting glass eels fluctuates with a lunar cycle. Abundances of glass eels showed a diel rhythm and a tidal rhythm with eels appearing only at night and catches during flood tide being higher than during ebb tide, indicating 'Selective Tidal Stream Transport' that eels utilize flood tidal-streams selectively at night to migrate inshore. The generalized additive models (GAM) for the abundance suggested that relatively long timescale factors such as 'recruitment season' and 'lunar age' could affect the abundance of glass eels. The GAM for glass eel presence/absence indicated that the timing of glass eel ascending into the water column during flood tide at night was at 150-180 min after low tide, which tended to synchronize with the rise of water temperature caused by the inflow of warm water from the Pacific coast outside the lake. Results suggested that a temperature increase at the beginning of flood tide may be a cue for the ascending behavior, or at least could be a zeitgeber of the circatidal rhythm regulating the ascending behavior.

Kfltz. was the dominant attached alga in streams and along lake shores in southern Ontario. Maximum production occurred in summer and resulted from 2 short periods of intensive vegetative growth (June and Sept.). Optimum habitat conditions consist of a firm substrate in shallow alkaline water. These conditions are provided by harbor facilities where man-made structures supplement naturally occurring rock outcrops or cobble beaches and where nutrients are available from tributaries draining agricultural and urban land areas. Periodicity appears to be related to temperature; the interval between the 2 periods of intensive growth during warm weather decreases at successively more northern locations. Frequent observation of Cladophora growing at a single stream station revealed that variations in thallus morphology and relative cell dimensions of C. glomerata are greater than has generally been recognized. These variations can be attributed to changes in environmental conditions and events in the annual life cycle of the alga.																			0022-3646	1529-8817					1967	3	2					57	+		10.1111/j.1529-8817.1967.tb04631.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.1967.tb04631.x								27064803					WOS:A19679692700001

The Late Younger Dryas is characterized by a general trend towards a fall in lake-level and a large climatic instability. The Early to Mid-Holocene period shows two large lowering phases developing during the Preboreal and the first half of the Older Atlantic. Each of these phases was interrupted by a shea-term rise in lake-level, and followed by a major and durable high lake-level event occurring during the Boreal and the second half of the Older Atlantic. This regional pattern of climatic changes presents similarities with climatic changes recorded both in western and central Europe and in the Atlantic ocean.

Altinyazi, Karaidemir, Kayalikoy, Sultankoy and Suloglu Dam Lakes are located in Thrace Region and they were constructed by DSI (State Water Works) in order to provide irrigation and drinking water and flood protection. The aim of this study was to determine a total of 25 essential and toxic element accumulations in water of these significant reservoirs (Li, Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Tl and Pb) and apply the Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WAWQI) in order to evaluate the water quality in terms of drinking purposes. Cluster Analysis (CA) was also used to classify the investigated elements and stations in terms of similar characteristics. Water samples were collected in spring season (rainy) of 2018 from 15 stations and element accumulations were investigated by using an ICP-MS. According to results of elemental CA, 4 statistically significant clusters were formed in terms of similar elemental densities, which were named as "most intense elements", "high-moderate intense elements", "low-moderate intense elements" and "rarest elements". According to results of locational CA, 2 statistically significant clusters were formed in terms of similar water quality characteristics, which were named as "more polluted locations" and "less polluted locations". According to the results of WAWQI, the reservoirs has "A grade" water quality and the values of overall WAWQI were within the permissible limits (<100).

Host adaptive radiation is associated with rapid virus diversification and cross-species transmission in African cichlid fishes	CURRENT BIOLOGY												Adaptive radiations are generated through a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors. Although adaptive radiations have been widely studied in the context of animal and plant evolution, little is known about how they impact the evolution of the viruses that infect these hosts, which in turn may provide insights into the drivers of cross -species transmission and hence disease emergence. We examined how the rapid adaptive radiation of the cichlid fishes of African Lake Tanganyika over the last 10 million years has shaped the diversity and evolution of the viruses they carry. Through metatranscriptomic analysis of 2,242 RNA sequencing libraries, we identified 121 vertebrate -associated viruses among various tissue types that fell into 13 RNA and 4 DNA virus groups. Host -switching was commonplace, particularly within the Astroviridae, Metahepadnavirus, Nackednavirus, Picornaviridae, and Hepacivirus groups, occurring more frequently than in other fish communities. A time -calibrated phylogeny revealed that hepacivirus diversification was not constant throughout the cichlid radiation but accelerated 2-3 million years ago, coinciding with a period of rapid cichlid diversification and niche packing in Lake Tanganyika, thereby providing more closely related hosts for viral infection. These data depict a dynamic virus ecosystem within the cichlids of Lake Tanganyika, characterized by rapid virus diversification and frequent host jumping, and likely reflecting their close phylogenetic relationships that lower the barriers to cross -species virus transmission.

J	Yu, ZC; McAndrews, JH; Eicher, U				Yu, ZC; McAndrews, JH; Eicher, U			Middle Holocene dry climate caused by change in atmospheric circulation patterns: Evidence from lake levels and stable isotopes	GEOLOGY												Sediment hiatuses, detritus layers, and inwashed terrestrial moss layers in five cores at Crawford Lake, Ontario, Canada, show that the lake level was low between ca. 4.8 and 2 ka (1 ka = 1000 C-14 yr B.P.). This low level is attributed to a dry and warm climate, which has also been documented at other sites in southern Ontario, southern Michigan, and southern Wisconsin. Oxygen isotope (delta(18)O) values from authigenic marl show a negative shift of 2.4 parts per thousand from -9 parts per thousand to -11.4 parts per thousand (Vienna Peedee belemnite) between ca. 5 and 2 ka. Enhanced evaporation under dry and likely closed-basin conditions would lead to more enrichment in O-18, so we suggest that the trend to depleted O-18 indicates a significant change in the delta(18)O value of the source meteoric water. The major moisture source for the Great Lakes region is the Gulf of Mexico, from which the amount and seasonality of precipitation are affected by the interplay of air masses from the Gulf of Mexico and North Pacific, probably controlled by jet stream positions and storm tracks. In the late middle Holocene, the isotopically heavy moisture from the gulf might have contributed less precipitation and/or a higher proportion in winter months, probably caused by more frequent eastward extension of dry Pacific air depleted in O-18. This hypothesis implies that the delta(18)O values of paleoprecipitation in the middle Holocene reflected moisture-source history more strongly than paleotemperature.

The concentration of unsupported 210Pb in the water column is maintained principally by atmospheric input. However, most of the 210Po in Crystal Lake is produced in situ from radioactive decay of 210Pb. Mass balance considerations indicated that the removal rates of 210Pb and 210Po from the water column to the sediment varied temporally by nearly an order of magnitude. During transient periods of high biological productivity, a large net flux of these nuclides into the sediment occurred. In addition, 210Pb was rapidly stripped from the water column during fall turnover. During these short-lived events most of the annual net removal of 210Pb and 210Po occurred. The mean removal residence time was estimated 0.095 yr for 210Pb and 0.26 yr for 210Po. These residence times suggest that there is a difference between 210Pb and 210Po in the extent of their recycling in the water column. There was a cyclic response of the water column 210Po inventory corresponding to successive time periods where there was a net loss or net gain. This cycling is attributed to rapid biological removal and subsequent release from the sediment of freshly deposited 210Po. For 210Pb, replenishment of the water column apparently occurred mainly from atmospheric input.																			0016-7037	1872-9533					1984	48	10					2053	2063		10.1016/0016-7037(84)90386-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(84)90386-7													WOS:A1984TP17900016

From these data, we calculated mixed layer depth, several measures of light penetration (diffuse attenuation coefficient, first optical depth, euphotic zone depth), and depth of the subsurface chlorophyll-a maxima. During summer, mean offshore mixed layer depth was typically 10-15 m, Kd for PAR was 0.1-0.17 m(-1), first optical depth was 6-9 m, euphotic zone depth was 35-40 m, and depth of subsurface chlorophyll-a maxima was 30-35 m. We also observed substantial spatial and temporal variation in these values across the basin and within and among seasons. Glider-based observations provide a wider horizontal and vertical perspective than other methods (e.g., ship- and satellite-based observations, buoys, and fixed moorings), and are therefore a valuable, complementary tool for Great Lakes limnology. The set of observations reported here provide seasonal and basin-scale information that may help to identify anomalies useful for future glider-assisted investigation into the role of biophysical processes in Great Lakes limnology and ecology.

However, the mechanisms of CH4 generation remain unclear in sediments of shallow urban lakes. The aims of this investigation were to study the characterization of environmental parameters, CH4 generation, and methanogen populations in Wulongtan Lake, China, which is affected solely by nonpoint pollution. Materials and methods The concentrations of CH4 in the atmosphere and of vertical sediment profiles and the methane flux at the air-water interface were monitored in the summer of 2012. Environmental parameters in the water column and in the vertical sediment profiles were assayed. The activities of cellulose, saccharase, polyphenol oxidase, and urease enzyme and 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of Archaea (ARC), Methanobacteriales (MBT), Methanococcales (MCC), Methanomicrobiales (MMB), Methanosarcinales (MSL), Methanosarcinaceae (MSC), and Methanosaetaceae (MST) were determined in the vertical sediment profiles. The abundance of methyl-coenzyme A reductase (ME) gene was also determined to evaluate the total activities of methanogens. Results and discussion High CH4 concentrations were detected in the atmosphere above the lake, and the mean CH4 flux at the air-water interface was 6.21 mM m(-2) h(-1). Dissolved oxygen decreased with an increase of water depth. Eh values and CH4 contents increased, but total nitrogen, water content, and total organic carbon (TOC) decreased with an increase of sediment depth. Cellulose, saccharase, polyphenol oxidase, and urease activities were detected in all sedimentary layers. The copy number of 16S rRNA gene (wet weight) for Archaea reached the highest value in the surface sediment. Copy numbers of ME were higher at 12-33 cm than at 0-6 cm. In general, abundances of MMB, MBT, and MSL were higher than that of MCC in the same sedimentary layer. 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of MST decreased with increasing depth, while MSC was higher at 18-27 cm than that at other sections. These indicate that hydrogenotrophic, aceticlastic, and methylotrophic pathways coexisted in these sediments. Principal component analysis revealed that in the sediments, the level of CH4 was closely related with several parameters including saccharase, urease, ME, and MBT, while TOC content was related to CEL, MST, ARC, water content, and Eh. Conclusions High CH4 release potential was detected in this shallow urban lake and can be ascribed to the anaerobic aquatic environment, bacterial enzyme activities, and methanogens. The orders MMB, MBT, and MSL were dominant in sediments for CH4 production. The presence of orders or families of methanogens might be determined by the types of available substrates in lake sediments.					zhang, shijie/HGF-0836-2022; Wang, Chao/GXF-8353-2022; wang, pei/MTG-1182-2025														1439-0108	1614-7480				MAY	2014	14	5					1004	1012		10.1007/s11368-014-0858-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-0858-8													WOS:000336080500016

A long-term secular increase in moisture availability from the early/mid Holocene to the present, driven by increasing summer insolation resulting from precessional changes in the Earth's orbit, has been documented in earlier studies. However, higher frequency Holocene variability is not yet understood. Here we present high-resolution diatom assemblage data from two small Altiplano lakes, Lago Lagunillas and Lago Umayo, indicating changes in effective moisture in the southern tropical Andes at decadal, centennial and millennial timescales throughout the mid to late Holocene. A strong millennial-scale component, similar in pacing to periods of increased ice-rafted debris flux in the North Atlantic, is observed in both lake records, which suggests that regional precipitation and North Atlantic climate variability are coupled at these scales. The interpretation of the higher frequency variability is hampered by the small number of high-resolution continental and marine records for comparison.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2008	18	6					867	876		10.1177/0959683608093524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683608093524													WOS:000258754900003

Phytoplankton species have several mechanisms that allow them to overcome phosphorus starvation, such as high-affinity uptake of orthophosphate (P-i), stand-by energy metabolism or utilization of phosphorus from stored polyphosphates. This short review is focused on the production of extracellular phosphatases that is usually accompanied by high-affinity uptake of P-i. Extracellular phosphatases are localized on the cell membrane, where they catalyze the liberation of P-i from various organic compounds that are too large to be directly transported into the cell. The production of extracellular phosphatases is not a general response to starvation in phytoplankton; it is a species-specific or cell-specific feature. The ELF (Enzyme Labelled Fluorescence) technique enables direct visualization of the sites of enzymatic activity and therefore gives detailed information about the physiological status of natural phytoplankton.

The sea lamprey invasion simultaneously caused wide-spread devastation while giving rise to a collective realization that the health of the Great Lakes would require ongoing cooperation among governments, scientists, and users of the resource. Since its inception, the effort to control sea lampreys in the Great Lakes has been defined by a "shoot for the moon" mentality. The desperation of communities directly harmed by the sea lamprey invasion, coupled with the determination and unyielding commitment to science by those tasked with addressing the problem, led to the formation of the only reported successful aquatic vertebrate invasive species control program at an ecosystem scale.

J	Tian, C; Pei, HY; Hu, WR; Xie, J				Tian, Chang; Pei, Haiyan; Hu, Wenrong; Xie, Jun			Variation of cyanobacteria with different environmental conditions in Nansi Lake, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Nansi Lake is located on the east line of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China. A comprehensive study was carried out to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of cyanobacteria in the lake from June 2008 to May 2011 based on monthly sample monitoring from five stations. The effect of environmental factors on cyanobacterial abundance was also evaluated. The cyanobacterial community contained 15 genera and 23 species. The cyanobacterial abundance of each monitoring station ranged from 0 to 1.53x10(7) cells/L with an average of 1.45x10(6) cells/L, which accounted for 11.66% of the total phytoplankton abundance. The dominant species of cyanobacteria were Pseudanabaena (32.94%) and Merismopedia (19.85%), not the bloom-forming algae such as Microcystis and Anabaena. In addition, the cyanobacterial community structure and water quality variables changed substantially over the survey period. Redundancy analysis (RDA) suggested that temperature and phosphorus were important environmental factors that affected cyanobacteria. Temperature was the most important factor affecting cyanobacterial abundance. The effect of phosphorus on cyanobacterial abundance was more notable in warm periods than in periods with low temperature.																			1001-0742	1878-7320					2012	24	8					1394	1402		10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60964-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60964-9								23513680					WOS:000308448000006

The annual export of K was strongly influenced by high K concentrations at the initiation of spring melt. Potassium concentrations were positively correlated with concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon, particulate and dissolved phosphorus, and particulate, dissolved organic and ammonium nitrogen, suggesting a common origin in the decomposition of tundra plants. Calcium and Mg stream concentrations were generally highest in July and August when the depth of the soil active layer reached a maximum of approximately 0.5 m. Precipitation-derived Na and K accounted for up to half of the Na and K stream export while chemical weathering supplied > 85 % of exported Ca and Mg. Cation export rates in these arctic foothill watersheds are among the lowest recorded.

Four coefficients of the TP model were successfully ''calibrated'' by matching observations from 1977, the only period when sediment TP and stream loads were measured simultaneously but a period when sewage loads were low. A fifth coefficient, sediment layer thickness, had to be specified a priori. Model performance was satisfactory except occasionally in summer when the predicted stratification was incorrect, and during 1982-89 when sewage loads were high. The model predicts a noticeable reduction in lakewater TP concentration within 20 years but only a slow reduction in sediment concentration. Internal loads are predicted to remain a feature of the lake but gradually to decrease in frequency and size. It would be desirable to improve prediction of sediment layer thickness and bioavailability, and to apply the model to nitrogen.																			0028-8330					SEP	1996	30	3					383	396		10.1080/00288330.1996.9516725	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1996.9516725													WOS:A1996VL66200010

This documents a case of natural reproduction of the regularly stocked non-native carp in Swedish waters, near the northern limit for the stocking operations. Stocking of common carp in Sweden is generally conducted under assumptions that reproduction is not possible due to low spring-time water temperatures not meeting the reproductive requirements of common carp. Our observation suggests that risks for ecological impacts through the establishment of self-reproducing populations of common carp can be higher than previously assumed. We recommend that this observation is considered when deciding on permits for future carp stocking in Sweden.

El Chichon displays mineralogical and geochemical characteristics that are unique with respect to typical arc volcanoes and other volcanic centers within the Chiapas belt, including mineralized lithic fragments. Several decade-old published research studies have alluded to the possible connection between El Chichon magmatism and porphyry Cu mineralization. We aim to summarize these observations, and along with new hornblende mineral thermobarometry demonstrate that they complement current models for the genesis of fertile parental magmas and the development of Porphyry Cu-Mo- Au Systems. We suggest that while the 1982 plinian eruption revealed the epithermal portion of the magmatic-hydrothermal system, the altered lithic fragments found in pyroclastic deposits likely represent a mineralized zone from an actively developing porphyry deposit at depth.

Luke; Blythe, Nathan			From detachment to transtensional faulting: A model for the Lake Mead extensional domain based on new ages and correlation of subbasins	MIOCENE TECTONICS OF THE LAKE MEAD REGION, CENTRAL BASIN AND RANGE	Geological Society of America Special Papers											New studies of selected basins in the Miocene extensional belt of the northern Lake Mead domain, southern Nevada, suggest refinements on previous models for the early extensional history of the region. Critical data come from (1) the Longwell Ridges area, west of Overton Arm and within the Lake Mead fault system; (2) the Salt Spring Wash Basin, in the hanging wall of the South Virgin Mountains-White Hills detachment fault; and (3) previously studied subbasins of the South Virgin Mountains in the Gold Butte step-over region. Our model focuses on the early history of extension and involves analysis of the lower Horse Spring Formation and correlative strata. The basins and fault patterns suggest two stages of basin development related to two distinct faulting episodes, an early period of detachment faulting, followed by a switch to faulting mainly along the Lake Mead transtensional fault system while detachment faulting waned. Apatite fission-track ages suggest that the footwall block of the detachment fault began cooling at 18-17 Ma. The 18-17 Ma time period appears to be the age of the upper limestone of the Rainbow Gardens Member of the Horse Spring Formation, which is interpreted to be a pre-extensional unit deposited only north of Gold Butte block in the Gold Butte step-over basin, where facies patterns and slow rates of sedimentation make faulting uncertain. The first definite basin stage occurred ca. 16.5-15.5 Ma, during which there was slow to moderate faulting and basin subsidence in a contiguous basin along the South Virgin Mountains-White Hills detachment fault and in the Gold Butte step-over basin; the step-over basin had complex fluvial and lacustrine facies and was synchronous with landslides and debris flows in the basin in the hanging wall of the detachment fault. At ca. 15.5-14.5 Ma, there was a dramatic increase in sedimentation rate related to formation or increased activity on the Gold Butte fault, a change from lacustrine to widespread fluvial, playa, and local landslide facies in the step-over basin, and the peak of exhumation and faulting rates on the detachment fault. The simple early Gold Butte step-over basin broke up into numerous subbasins at ca. 15.5-14.5 Ma as initial faults of the Lake Mead fault system formed. From 14.5 to 14.0 Ma, a major change occurred from dominantly detachment faulting to dominantly transtensional (strike-slip + normal) faulting in the Lake Mead fault system as detachment faulting waned. At this time, the Lake Mead fault system began to propagate to the west, and activity on faults and in subbasins north of Gold Butte slowed or ceased, accompanied by major progradation of alluvial conglomerates over the step-over basin. The geometry of the South Virgin Mountains-White Hills detachment fault that dominated the early Lake Mead extension history fundamentally controlled patterns of faulting and magmatism throughout the rest of the extensional history, even as the detachment faulting itself slowed from 14 to 11 Ma, when it ceased to be active. In a regional view, the detachment faulting in eastern Lake Mead is linked to and forms the northern end of the ca. 20-11 Ma northern Colorado River extension corridor. Similar to the rest of the corridor, faulting and exhumation peaked at 15 Ma, but at the north end of the corridor in eastern Lake Mead, detachment faulting changed rapidly to dominantly transtensional left-lateral faulting of the Lake Mead fault system. Eastern Lake Mead shows evidence for a spatial boundary between the southern and central Basin and Range that is best thought of as a northeast-southwest-trending feature located on numerous older tectonic boundaries. The area also records a temporal change from detachment to transtensional faulting characteristic of the central Basin and Range after 15 Ma.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2463-8				2010	463						371	394		10.1130/2010.2463(17)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2010.2463(17)													WOS:000286214300017

Na/K and K/Mg ratios indicate that the Aq. 2 composition represents a deep mature hydrothermal fluid. The Ca/Sr ratios are unusually low for Aq. 2 (similar to 17) compared to Aq. 1 (similar to 130) and not obviously related to Ca/Sr in the wall rocks. On the other hand, based on the similarity of Sr-87/Sr-86 from waters and wall rocks, we suggest that Aq. 1 is shallow and composed of volcanic rocks, while Aq. 2 is deeper and composed of sedimentary rocks.

Dust-mediated loading of trace and major elements to Wasatch Mountain snowpack	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Depth-integrated snow columns were collected at 12 sites across the central Wasatch Mountains, Utah, during March and April 2010 to determine concentrations of trace elements, major anions and cations, and pH. Sample collection was conducted at or near maximum snow accumulation prior to the onset of melt, and included spring dust events driven by southerly pre-frontal winds. Snow samples were melted in the laboratory and subsampled for analyses on filtered (0.45 mu m) and unfiltered fractions. All measured elements (Al, As, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sr, Ti, Tl, U, V. and Zn) and major anions (Cl, NO3, and SO4) displayed significant increases in concentration (for example, factor of 2 to 5 increases for As, Cr, Hg, and Pb) between the six sites sampled in March (prior to dust events) and the six sites sampled in April (after dust events). Acid neutralizing capacity and pH were also elevated in April relative to March snowpack. Comparison of elemental concentration in the particulate (>0.45 mu m; difference between unfiltered and filtered concentration) and soluble (<0.45 mu m; filtered concentration) fractions shows that the concentration increase between March and April snowpack for the trace elements is primarily a result of association with dust particles >0.45 mu m. The results suggest that the majority of trace element loading to the Wasatch snowpack occurs via dust deposition. The major elements were primarily loaded in the <0.45 mu m fraction, suggesting deposition of soluble dust particles. The overall findings of this paper are similar to other studies regarding the role of dust on nutrient and trace element accumulation in soils and lake sediments, but to our knowledge this is the first study that compares trace element chemistry of seasonal snowpack before and after dust deposition events.

J	HENDERSON, BA; NEPSZY, SJ				HENDERSON, BA; NEPSZY, SJ			RECRUITMENT OF YELLOW PERCH (PERCA-FLAVESCENS) AFFECTED BY STOCK SIZE AND WATER TEMPERATURE IN LAKES ERIE AND ST-CLAIR 1965-85	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Two influences on recruitment of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were considered: parental stock size and spring water temperatures. The data for this analysis were obtained from two sources. First, from samples of trawl catches (near bottom) from April to October (1965-85) in the western, central, and eastern basins of Lake Erie, and from Lake St. Clair and second, from gillnet catches from April to July in the three basins of Lake Erie (1978-86). The relative abundances (CPUE) of stocks in these study areas were as follows: western > St. Clair > eastern > central basin. Degree-days and mean water temperatures of the basins were ranked as follows: St. Clair > western > central > eastern basin. Rates of warming of water were greatest in the western basin, followed by St. Clair, central basin, and eastern basin. The rates of increase in water temperature (April to June) were positively related to average water temperatures and total degree-days (above 0.degree.C). Only in the western basin of Lake Erie could the variations in recruitment to age 1 + be apportioned to the effect of parental stock size (12%) and water warming in the spring (51%). Recruitment at age 0 + (young-of-year(YOY)) was explained also by both warming rate (17%) and parental stock size (12%) for the samples from the western basin. The pooled data obtained from samples of catches in the gillnets indicated that only parental stock size (19%) determined the abundance of perch at age 1 + yrs-old. The relative abundance of yearlings was related to the abundance of YOY perch in the previous year in only the central and western basins (trawl sample). The dependence of recruitment on the density of the parental stock was evident from the regression of the ratio of recruits (age 1 +) to spawners on parental stock size in the combined trawl samples from Lakes Erie and St. Clair, and in the separate samples from the eastern and central basins of Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair. Similarly, recruitment at age 0 + (YOY) was also shown to be density-dependent in all but the western basin of Lake Erie. The coefficients obtained by regressing recruitment (0 +, 1 + years) on stock size were significant and less than 1 in the pooled sample from the western basin and St. Clair, indicating density-dependent recruitment.																			0380-1330						1988	14	2					205	215		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71549-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71549-X													WOS:A1988N631100010

A total of 10 sand and gravel pits and more than 100 wells were examined to document the complex facies architecture. The field study was supplemented with a ground-penetrating radar survey and a shear-wave seismic survey. All collected sedimentological and geophysical data were integrated into a high-resolution three-dimensional geological model for reconstructing the spatial distribution of facies associations. The Porta subaqueous fan and delta complex consist of three fan bodies deposited on a flat lake-bottom surface at the margin of a retreating ice lobe. The northernmost fan complex is up to 55 m thick, 6.2 km wide and 6.5 km long. The incipient fan deposition is characterized by high-energy flows of a plane-wall jet. Very coarse-grained, highly scoured jet-efflux deposits with an elongate plan shape indicate a high Froude number, probably > 5. These jet-efflux sediments are deposited in front of a large similar to 3.2 km long, up to 1.2 km wide, and up to 25 m deep flute-like scour, indicating the most proximal erosion and bypass area of the jet that widens and deepens with distance downstream to the region of maximum turbulence (approximately five times the conduit diameter). Evidence for subsequent flow splitting is given by the presence of two marginal gravel fan lobes, deposited in front of 1.3 to 2.5 km long flute-like scours, that are 0.8 to 1 km wide and 7 to 20 m deep. In response to continued aggradation, small jets developed at the periphery of these bar-like deposits and filled in the low areas adjacent to the original superelevated regions, locally raising the depositional surface and characterized by large-scale trough cross-stratified sand and pebbly sand. The incision of an up to 1.2 km wide and up to 35 m deep channel into the evolving fan is attributed to a catastrophic drainage event, probably related to a lake outburst and lake-level fall in the range of 40 to 60 m. At the mouth of this channel, highly scoured jet-efflux deposits formed under hydraulic-jump conditions during flow expansion. Subsequently, Gilbert-type deltas formed on the truncated fan margin, recording a second lake-level drop in the range of 30 to 40 m. These catastrophic lake-level falls were probably caused by rapid ice-lobe retreat controlled by the convex-up bottom topography of the ice valley.

J	Deino, AL				Deino, Alan L.			40Ar/39Ar dating of Bed I, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, and the chronology of early Pleistocene climate change	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												40Ar/39Ar dating of tuffs and lavas of the late Pleistocene volcanic and sedimentary sequence of Olduvai Gorge, north-central Tanzania, provides the basis for a revision of Bed I chronostratigraphy. Bed I extends from immediately above the Naabi Ignimbrite at 2.038 +/- 0.005 Ma to Tuff IF at 1.803 +/- 0.002 Ma. Tuff IB, a prominent widespread marker tuff in the basin and a key to understanding hominin evolutionary chronologies and paleoclimate histories, has an age of 1.848 +/- 0.003 Ma. The largest lake expansion event in the closed Olduvai lake basin during Bed I times encompassed the episode of eruption and emplacement of this tuff. This lake event is nearly coincident with the maximum precessional insolation peak of the entire Bed I/Lower Bed II interval, calculated from an astronomical model of the boreal summer orbital insolation time-series. The succeeding precessional peak also apparently coincides with the next youngest expansion of paleo-Lake Olduvai. The extreme wet/dry climate shifts seen in the upper part of Bed I occur during an Earth-orbital eccentricity maximum, similar to episodic lake expansions documented elsewhere in the East African Rift during the Neogene.

J	Hosmani, SP; Kumar, LV; Partha, S				Hosmani, SP; Kumar, LV; Partha, S			Ecological significance of biochemical parameters in certain fresh water lakes of Mysore.	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Studies on biochemical aspects of water pollution based on analysis of glycolic acid, chlorophylls, phycobiliproteins and total dissolved solids were made in twenty lakes in aro;nd Mysore city. Four categories of water have been recognized based on the range of glycolic acid present. The high values of glycolic acid may be due to high contents of organic pollutants coupled with high intensities of light during summer that inhibit algal photosynthesis and increase the percentage of extracellular release. The glycollate excrete may directly reflect the growth and photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton. High amounts of pollutants enhance the growth of bluegreen algae and in turn increase phycobiliproteins. Phytoplankton members of Euglenaceae also occur as mixed organisms to be of lesser relevance. Total dissolved solid content is high in Melkote lake, possibly due to the regular disturbance by devotees visiting the temple tank.																			0254-8704					APR	1999	20	2					121	124																WOS:000079334800007

The oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate (delta 18Op) is a powerful tool for tracking P sources and cycling in diverse natural ecosystems. Here, we use delta 18Op distribution in a small freshwater body (a lagoon-lake system) with high biological activity. We report delta 18Op values seasonally along the water flow path in lagoon-lake system adjacent to Lake Biwa, Japan. The delta 18Op values of inflowing water originating as agricultural runoff were constant throughout the study period at +16.3 parts per thousand +/- 0.2 parts per thousand. The delta 18Op values in the system were generally offset from temperature-dependent isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding water, ranging from +11.1 parts per thousand to +17.8 parts per thousand. The delta 18Op values of the lake water approached equilibrium values in July and October, when dissolved inorganic P (DIP) retention rates were high, consistent with extensive biologically mediated phosphate cycling. A delta 18Op two end-member mixing model, involving inflowing P and biologically recycled P, suggests that P turnover rates in the lagoon-lake system were high during the productive seasons. In contrast, the longer lake water residence time in the non-irrigation season (winter) allowed delta 18Op values to deviate toward lower values relative to both equilibrium and agricultural source delta 18Op values, suggesting that P metabolism was dominated by extracellular/ecto-enzymatic hydrolysis of dissolved organic P under low DIP concentrations. This work highlighted the utility of delta 18Op for understanding P dynamics in shallow lake ecosystems.

Evidence for a meteoritic origin of the September 15, 2007, Carancas crater	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												On September 15th, 2007, around 11:45 local time in Peru, near the Bolivian border, the atmospheric entry of a meteoroid produced bright lights in the sky and intense detonations. Soon after, a crater was discovered south of Lake Titicaca. These events have been detected by the Bolivian seismic network and two infrasound arrays operating for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, Situated at about 80 and 1620 km from the crater. The localization and origin time computed with the seismic records are consistent with the reported impact. The entry elevation and azimuthal angles of the trajectory are estimated from the observed signal time sequences and back-azimuths. From the crater diameter and the airwave amplitudes, the kinetic energy, mass and explosive energy are calculated. Using the estimated velocity of the meteoroid and similarity criteria between orbital elements, an association with possible parent asteroids is attempted. The favorable setting of this event provides a unique opportunity to evaluate physical and kinematic parameters of the object that generated the first actual terrestrial meteorite impact seismically recorded.					; Evers, Läslo/E-5707-2011; Drob, Douglas/G-4061-2014; Hernandez, Bruno/E-1742-2011	Le Pichon, Alexis/0000-0001-6531-069X; Evers, Laslo/0000-0003-2825-6211; Drob, Douglas/0000-0002-2045-7740; Hernandez, Bruno/0000-0002-9028-2771													1086-9379	1945-5100				NOV	2008	43	11					1797	1809																WOS:000263510700004

The Garton pump destratified Ham''s Lake (40 ha) in 3 days. Except for 1 small isolated basin, Ham''s Lake remained completely destratified for the rest of the summer. Algal biomass declined, numbers of species of green algae increased, but numbers of species of blue-green algae did not decrease as expected. After destratification, pH remained high (> 8), carbonate alkalinity was observed and reactive phosphate was undetectable. An axial flow pump increased the heat content of Arbuckle Lake (95I ha) and caused the lake to destratify about 1 mo. earlier than usual. Increasing the heat content of the lake did not affect the concentration of most water quality parameters or the biomass of algae.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	55	2					129	138		10.1007/BF00021054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00021054													WOS:A1977DU02000004
J	RICH, PH				RICH, PH			HYPOLIMNETIC METABOLISM IN 3 CAPE COD LAKES	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The hypolimnetic O2 deficits and CO2 increments in 3 closed-basin, kettle lakes on Cape Cod were examined during summer stratification in 1976. Areal hypolimnetic O2 deficits ranged from oligotrophic (Gull and Hathaway Ponds) to distinctly mesotrophic (Mares Pond). Areal hypolimnetic dissolved inorganic C increments (assuming aerobic RQ [respiratory quotient] = 0.85) ranged higher, to borderline eutrophic for Mares Pond. Both O2 uptake and dissolved inorganic C (DIC) release were correlated inversely with the amount of light reaching the hypolimnion. The observed ratios of DIC released to O2 taken up (RQ = CO2/O2) in the hypolimnia of the 3 lakes varied from 1.4 (Mares) to 3.4 (Gull), and may correlate directly with the amount of light reaching the hypolimnion. Underwater light may suppress O2 uptake more than DIC release. Lakes may significantly augment their inventories of alternate electron acceptors by donating electrons to anaerobic photosynthesis at or below the light compensation depth.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1980	104	1					102	109		10.2307/2424963	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424963													WOS:A1980KG11300011

William, Jr.			Development of eutrophication criteria for Minnesota streams and rivers using multiple lines of evidence	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Development of water-quality criteria to address eutrophication impacts on aquatic life in streams and rivers lags behind development of lake eutrophication criteria, in part, because of multiple stressor pathways, natural variability in nutrient responses between water bodies, and a lack of methods that can address this complexity. Several investigators have demonstrated significant and predictable relationships among summer nutrients, sestonic chlorophyll a, and 5-d biochemical O-2 demand (BOD5) in medium to large Minnesota rivers. Diel dissolved O-2 (DO) flux also is positively correlated with total P (TP) and chlorophyll a concentrations. Our findings demonstrate significant relationships among several sensitive macroinvertebrate and fish metrics and TP, chlorophyll a, BOD5, and diel DO flux. Criteria were developed using multiple lines of evidence including quantile regression and regression tree analysis of macroinvertebrate and fish data and reference-condition analysis. A regional approach was used to develop eutrophication criteria and demonstrated that different criteria should be applied across regions. Draft river eutrophication criteria based on these lines of evidence are presented.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2015	34	2					574	592		10.1086/680662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/680662													WOS:000354387700016

Samples from living trees and from historical monuments were used. The chronology covers the period from 1550 to 2000, with at least 50 samples covering the first 300 years collected from different monuments. Time of construction was determined for three 18th century churches and one 19th century peasant's house. It was shown that for all monuments, the timber was logged 3-5 years before the time of building known from archival data. Research revealed that extreme low temperatures during the growing season resulted in a factor of 1.5-3 decrease in the tree ring width in 1601, 1783 and 1939-1940. In a majority of the samples, false rings induced by low temperatures in early summer are observed in 1601 and 1812. Density fluctuations of early wood are characteristic for the year 1810. For stands growing on soils with low water holding capacity and thus prone to water deficiency, variations in the width of annual rings are related to variations in rainfall. It is shown that fluctuations of the water level in Lake Onega can serve as an indicator of rainfall and, therefore ground water level. The availability of wooden structures of different ages in the museum enables objective correction of the regional chronology and a highly reliable interpretation of natural factors influencing tree growth in the region.

To represent the flood propagation between mainstream and floodplain, we use a model designed for flood propagation in river mainstreams with flat bed and large overflow and without topographic data. Depending on the water level in the riverbed, the model calibrated on the levels observed at two stations gives the level in the floodplains and propagation time between stations. Several cases are tested for various types of hydraulic connections between mainstream and floodplain. The model could correctly reproduce the flood rise and fall in the floodplain, even for a lake connected by a single channel to the riverbed or in the case of a strong attenuation of the flood between very distant stations.

The bird population was counted, the proportion of petioles cut by bird was estimated and the density of the four main invertebrate groups on the leaves was measured just after the breeding season, in July and then in September 1997 in the whole N. alba area (739 ha divided into 15 sections). Up to 6 +/- 1% of leaves were cut in July, with differences between sections (from 0.3 +/- 0.1 to 16 +/- 6%) when about 10,000 coots fed in this part of the lake. A positive relationship was recorded between the proportion of cut petioles and coot density during the first period (excluding sections where N. alba was mixed with another plant species, Trapa natans). In September, coot abundance fell to 5000 individuals and the impact decreased to 0.3 +/- 0.2% of leaves, new generations of leaves having meanwhile grown. The comparison of the mean density of invertebrates on cut and intact leaves showed a massive depletion of the beetle, Galerucella nymphaeae, present on the upper side of the leaves. The selection of this specific food item might explain this marked interaction, which was nevertheless insignificant in September because of high turn over rates of the plant.

WATER RESEARCH												An enclosure experiment in the shallow, subtropical Lake Donghu, China, was performed in the summer of 2001 to examine the effect of TN:TP (total phosphorus) ratios and P-reduction on the occurrence of Microcysitis blooms. The treatments were performed with enough amounts of N but with different amounts of P in the water column and sediment. Microcystis blooms occurred in the enclosures either with an initial TN:TP <29 or TN:TP >29 where the nutrients (N, P) were high enough. Microcysitis blooms never occurred in the treatments with low P concentration in spite of the presence of sufficient N. The P-rich sediments served as an important source for the P supply in the water column, and such a process was activated greatly by the outburst of Microcystis blooms which pumped up selectively P from the sediments and thus decreased the TN:TP ratios. Therefore, the low TN:TP ratio is not a cause but rather a result of Microcystis blooms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Members of the Genus Methylobacter Are Inferred To Account for the Majority of Aerobic Methane Oxidation in Oxic Soils from a Freshwater Wetland	MBIO												Microbial carbon degradation and methanogenesis in wetland soils generate a large proportion of atmospheric methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. Despite their potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, knowledge about methane-consuming methanotrophs is often limited to lower-resolution single-gene surveys that fail to capture the taxonomic and metabolic diversity of these microorganisms in soils. Here our objective was to use genome-enabled approaches to investigate methanotroph membership, distribution, and in situ activity across spatial and seasonal gradients in a freshwater wetland near Lake Erie. 16S rRNA gene analyses demonstrated that members of the methanotrophic Methylococcales were dominant, with the dominance largely driven by the relative abundance of four taxa, and enriched in oxic surface soils. Three methanotroph genomes from assembled soil metagenomes were assigned to the genus Methylobacter and represented the most abundant methanotrophs across the wetland. Paired metatranscriptomes confirmed that these Old Woman Creek (OWC) Methylobacter members accounted for nearly all the aerobic methanotrophic activity across two seasons. In addition to having the capacity to couple methane oxidation to aerobic respiration, these new genomes encoded denitrification potential that may sustain energy generation in soils with lower dissolved oxygen concentrations. We further show that Methylobacter members that were closely related to the OWC members were present in many other high-methane-emitting freshwater and soil sites, suggesting that this lineage could participate in methane consumption in analogous ecosystems. This work contributes to the growing body of research suggesting that Methylobacter may represent critical mediators of methane fluxes in freshwater saturated sediments and soils worldwide. IMPORTANCE Here we used soil metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to uncover novel members within the genus Methylobacter. We denote these closely related genomes as members of the lineage OWC Methylobacter. Despite the incredibly high microbial diversity in soils, here we present findings that unexpectedly showed that methane cycling was primarily mediated by a single genus for both methane production ("Candidatus Methanothrix paradoxum") and methane consumption (OWC Methylobacter). Metatranscriptomic analyses revealed that decreased methanotrophic activity rather than increased methanogenic activity possibly contributed to the greater methane emissions that we had previously observed in summer months, findings important for biogeochemical methane models. Although members of this Methylococcales order have been cultivated for decades, multi-omic approaches continue to illuminate the methanotroph phylogenetic and metabolic diversity harbored in terrestrial and marine ecosystems.					; Wrighton, Kelly/ABD-6621-2021; Stefanik, Kay/F-5036-2017; Stefanik, Kay C./F-5036-2017	Wrighton, Kelly/0000-0003-0434-4217; Borton, Mikayla/0000-0001-8037-4253; Daly, Rebecca/0000-0003-2223-7458; Smith, Garrett/0000-0002-1014-5102; Angle, Jordan/0000-0002-3260-5851; Stefanik, Kay C./0000-0001-7792-0516													2150-7511					NOV-DEC	2018	9	6							e00815-18	10.1128/mBio.00815-18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00815-18								30401770					WOS:000454730100004

With this light-weight box corer only a relatively small cross-sectional area is offered to the sediment, allowing easier penetration. The closure blade is propelled smoothly across the base of the box in a downwardly convex path by a set of constant force springs. Depending on choice of blade-release mechanisms, the corer can either be triggered immediately as the support cable slackens, after a delay of a few seconds, or immediately upon retrieval. The box corer has been used successfully to sample poorly consolidated sediments in freshwater lakes over a depth range of 8 to 1624 m.

A socio-ecological systems approach towards future research for the restoration, conservation and management of southern African estuaries	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												This Reflections article highlights the growing pressures that southern African estuaries are experiencing in the Anthropocene, as identified by the research presented in this Special Medal Issue. Estuaries are exposed to multiple stressors, and their responses to climate change are becoming increasingly evident. As the health of estuaries deteriorates, so does their ability to deliver valuable ecosystem services. Although legislation in southern Africa exists to ensure freshwater inflow, maintain water quality, promote sustainable resource use and control development in estuary functional zones, implementation of these measures is lacking. In some cases, the legal instruments themselves are falling short, such as the general standards for wastewater discharge, which are insufficiently stringent to prevent estuary eutrophication. Research on estuaries has clearly identified how these pressures influence estuaries and where intervention is required. Issues requiring attention, such as those elucidated through the monitoring and management options related to the Lake St Lucia estuarine system, have also been highlighted. Looking to the future, there is a requirement for estuarine research, in order to support cooperative governance and the implementation of the Ecological Reserve and Estuary Management Plans. The time is also right for a National Estuary Restoration Programme. A socio-ecological systems framework for the future research, restoration and management of estuaries is presented and recommended as a way forward.

Therefore, more and more studies have focused on extreme hydro-meteorological events in various climates and geographic regions. Based on nearly 50 years of observed records of the Poyang Lake Basin, the occurrence and changing trends of extreme streamflow indices, including the annual maximum flow, annual peak-over-threshold flows, and low flows, were analyzed for ten hydrological stations. The results indicate that most annual maximum flows occurred from April to July, highly attributed to the Southeast Asian summer monsoons, whereas the annual minimum flows were concentrated between January and February. As for the low flow indices (the annual minimum flow, annual minimum 7-d flow, and annual minimum 30-d flow), a significant increasing trend was detected in most parts of the Poyang Lake Basin. The trends illustrate the potential effects of climate change and human activities on the hydrological cycle over the Poyang Lake Basin.					; Tian, Kun/NLN-9482-2025	Zhao, Guangju/0000-0002-4233-9403; Zhao, Guangju/0000-0001-7756-4494													1674-2370	2405-8106					2011	4	2					121	132		10.3882/j.issn.1674-2370.2011.02.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3882/j.issn.1674-2370.2011.02.001													WOS:000219754300001
J	Gronkjær, P; Skov, C; Berg, S				Gronkjær, P; Skov, C; Berg, S			Otolith-based analysis of survival and size-selective mortality of stocked 0+year pike related to time of stocking	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The effect of time of stocking on the extent and source of mortality in 0+ year pike Esox lucius was investigated in a lake (20 ha) and a drainable pond (0(.)5 ha) using pike with alizarin marked otoliths. The results indicated that pike stocked late relative to the recruitment of native 0+ year pike fell victim to cannibalism from these larger individuals. This resulted in very low survival through the first growing season (<2%). Pike stocked early in the season exhibited significantly higher survival (>12%). Analyses of the size distribution of the alizarin marks from these fish revealed that the largest 0+ year pike exhibited by a factor of 3(.)3, higher survival than the average 0+ year pike in the lake. In order for large 0+ year pike to exhibit such high relative fitness a minimum of 69(.)7% of the original population must suffer size dependent mortality. In the pond the survival of the largest pike was by a factor of 4(.)2 higher than the average pike, and the corresponding size dependent mortality was 76(.)4%. The substantial size-dependent mortality was most probably due to intra-cohort cannibalism or habitat segregation between large and small 0+ year pike that exposes the small pike to predatory fishes in the open lake. Cannibalism exerts a major influence on the survival of 0+ year pike post-stocking although the magnitude and origin differ in relation to stocking time.

A complete floristic inventory was made, and the relative frequencies of each algal taxon were estimated. Periphytic cumulative chlorophyll a was measured by means of artificial substrata. The stream was a typical maritime Antarctic lotic ecosystem, with evident signs of enrichment by sea-birds. Variability in discharge strongly affected the water chemistry, with the high water level periods characterized by the lowest conductivities and dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations. Epilithic algal communities predominantly consisted of algal mats or filamentous and foliose forms of Prasiola crispa. Other dominant species were Leptolyngbya fragilis, Hydrurus foetidus, Chrysococcus cf. rufescens and Phaeogloea mucosa. Whereas P. crispa appeared more frequently near to the origin of the stream in Boeckella Lake, Chrysophyceae were better developed towards the mouth.																			0954-1020	1365-2079				JUN	1996	8	2					161	167		10.1017/S0954102096000235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102096000235													WOS:A1996UN62900008

J	Sharma, S; Barrie, LA; Hastie, DR; Kelly, C				Sharma, S; Barrie, LA; Hastie, DR; Kelly, C			Dimethyl sulfide emissions to the atmosphere from lakes of the Canadian boreal region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) concentrations were measured over 2 years in 10 lakes situated in northwestern Ontario. Concentrations varied fi-om 0.1 nmol L-1 to 100 nmol L-1 (geometric mean of 1.2 nmol L-1) during the ice-free season (April to November) of 1995 and 1996. Shallow (1-5 m depth and 1-5 ha area) and medium depth (5-10 m depth and 5-15 ha area) lakes exhibited higher surface water DMS concentrations than deeper and larger lakes (32 m depth and 20-56 ha area). During the fall in the medium size lakes (5-12 m depth and <15 ha area), DMS concentrations increased markedly by a factor of as much as 100 because of circulation of deeper, high-DMS water from the hypolimnion (lake turnover). The estimated seasonal mean fluxes of DMS from shallow and medium-depth lakes to the atmosphere ranged between 0.058 and 15 mu mol S m(-2) d(-1) respectively. The shallow and medium depth lakes tend to release higher DMS than the large and deeper lakes. Extrapolation of flux estimates indicates that the lakes of the Canadian Boreal Shield emit 1.5 Gg yr(-1) biogenic sulfur (DMS) to the atmosphere, and this is approximately 83% of the total annual biogenic sulfur (DMS) emissions from the Canadian Boreal Shield (lakes plus terrestrial). Compared to the annual anthropogenic emissions by five smelters in the boreal region, these emissions are small (0.08%).

Early season population dynamics of salvinia weevil on giant salvinia in central Louisiana	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												A single salvinia weevil (Brazil ecotype) (Cyrtobagous salviniae Calder and Sands) release was conducted on giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta D.S. Mitchell) infestations on Lake Iatt, LA, United States, during 2015. The site was not monitored postweevil release and it was assumed that yearly water level drawdowns and winter freezing temperatures most likely inhibited salvinia weevil establishment. In February 2017, lake managers surveying for giant salvinia were surprised to discover salvinia weevils present lake wide, Large-scale monitoring efforts were initiated to document the occurrence of an established and self-sustaining salvinia weevil population. Adult and larval salvinia weevil density, plant nitrogen content, and water temperature were monitored every 2 wk during February through July 2017. The detection of larval weevils in February was used to estimate the previous timing of adult salvinia weevil mating and oviposition and it was determined that these reproductive activities occurred at a previously undocumented low temperature range fluctuating between 14.5 and 17 C. Adult and larval densities had a distinct inverse relationship during the early warm season. Adult densities steadily decreased as larval densities increased, indicative of overwintered adults mating and dying soon after. Adult and larval densities stabilized at subequal densities as water temperatures warmed, and continual mating, oviposition, and adult emergence produced stable densities of both adult and larval salvinia weevils in May and June. These monitoring efforts provided a rare field demonstration of the population dynamics of a lake-wide established and self-sustaining salvinia weevil population.																			0146-6623					JUL	2020	58						123	128																WOS:000554659600007

The waters of Purace were classified in 2 different groups as a function of the physico-chemical parameters and element distributions. Group 1 is characterized by the highest pH (similar to 3.5), an outlet temperature of similar to 81 degrees C and a strong depletion of Fe, Al, Si and Ba with respect to the isochemical dissolution of the average volcanic local rock. Group 2 waters have lower pH values similar to 1.9 and temperature (similar to 48 degrees C) compared with Group 1. Moreover, Group 2 is not characterized by a typical pathway representing the congruent dissolution of the rock and shows a distribution of major and minor elements that is more close to the near congruent dissolution of the average volcanic local rock with respect to Group 1. These geochemical features of major and minor elements allow to propose that the chemical composition of the waters of Group 1 is strongly affected by the precipitation of secondary minerals such as alunite, jarosite, kaolinite, barite and polymorphs of SiO2. The grouping of waters is also supported by the distribution of dissolved REE normalized to the average volcanic local rock. Group 1 shows REE patterns strongly depleted in light rare earth elements (LREE), typical of water that formed alunitic and/or kaolinitic rocks. On the contrary, Group 2 is characterized by flat patterns, in according to the near-congruent dissolution of the rocks. REE dissolved in waters of Purace were compared with REE in the acidic waters of Nevado del Ruiz and Azufral Colombian volcanoes and with REE in minerals recognized in advanced argillic alteration (alunite, gypsum and kaolinite). Precipitation of secondary minerals is proposed as a common process depleting LREE in acidic sulphate - chlorine waters in volcano - hydrothermal systems. Furthermore, the chemical fractionation of the major and minor elements was interpreted together with the corresponding distributions of REE in order to trace the water - rock interaction processes. Saturation indexes of most common secondary minerals identified in advanced argillic alterations were calculated using PHREEQC software in a range of temperature from 25 to 250 degrees C. This geochemical approach allows to identify the possible mineral precipitation or dissolution of secondary minerals as well as the temperature at which the water reached equilibrium with a given set of minerals. In Group 1, the precipitation of secondary minerals LREE enriched (alunite minerals and kaolinite) was traced at temperature of precipitation higher than similar to 101 degrees C.

J	Xu, YT; Fang, J; Tao, K; Fang, JY; Liu, YX				Xu, Yating; Fang, Jian; Tao, Kai; Fang, Jiayi; Liu, Yuxin			Increasing risk of synchronous floods in the Yangtze River basin from the shift in flood timing	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Floods are some of the most frequent and severe natural hazards worldwide. In the context of climate change, the risk of extreme floods is expected to increase in the future. While, the trends in flood timing and risk for flood synchronization remain unclear. In this study, the seasonality of flood peaks, annual maximum rainfall, and annual maximum soil moisture in the Yangtze River Basin were examined using observational and reanalysis data from 1949 to 2020. Changes in the timing of extreme events may increase the possibility of concurrent flooding, therefore the risk for synchronous floods were further explored. The results indicate that the seasonality of floods has a strong consistency with that of annual maximum rainfall. In the southern Yangtze River Basin, floods usually occur between early June and early July, with a delayed trend. However, they occur slightly later in the north, generally from late July to early August, with a tendency of advance. Overall, the timing of floods is positively correlated with rainfall and soil moisture peaks, and the correlation is much stronger for annual maximum rainfall. However, for more intense floods or for larger catchments, soil moisture plays an important role in modulating the variations in flood timing. Reverse latitudinal changes in flood timing are expected to result in more synchronous floods. The synchrony frequency exceeded 60 % for most of the stations, and the frequency was increasing for nearly half of the region, especially in the middle reaches, Poyang Lake and south of Dongting Lake. In addition, the flood synchrony scale in the south of the basin showed significant upward trends. These findings would provide important implications for flood risk management and adaptive strategy development.					刘, 雨欣/JXX-6277-2024; Fang, Jiayi/LKL-2195-2024														0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 15	2024	921								171167	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171167		FEB 2024						38395164					WOS:001196607200001

Ice Freeze-up and Break-up Detection of Shallow Lakes in Northern Alaska with Spaceborne SAR	REMOTE SENSING												Shallow lakes, with depths less than ca. 3.5-4 m, are a ubiquitous feature of the Arctic Alaskan Coastal Plain, covering up to 40% of the land surface. With such an extended areal coverage, lakes and their ice regimes represent an important component of the cryosphere. The duration of the ice season has major implications for the regional and local climate, as well as for the physical and biogeochemical processes of the lakes. With day and night observations in all weather conditions, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide year-round acquisitions. Monitoring the evolution of radar backscatter (sigma degrees) is useful for detecting the timing of the beginning and end of the ice season. Analysis of the temporal evolution of C-band sigma degrees from Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Wide Swath and RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR, with a combined frequency of acquisitions from two to five days, was employed to evaluate the potential of SAR to detect the timing of key lake-ice events. SAR observations from 2005 to 2011 were compared to outputs of the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo). Model simulations fall within similar ranges with those of the SAR observations, with a mean difference between SAR observations and model simulations of only one day for water-clear-of-ice (WCI) from 2006 to 2010. For freeze onset (FO), larger mean differences were observed. SAR analysis shows that the mean FO date for these shallow coastal lakes is 30 September and the mean WCI date is 5 July. Results reveal that greater variability existed in the mean FO date (up to 26 days) than in that of melt onset (MO) (up to 12 days) and in that of WCI (6 days). Additionally, this study also identifies limitations and provides recommendations for future work using C-band SAR for monitoring the Lake-ice phenology of shallow Arctic lakes.

In Ebinur Lake, a fuzzy water-land boundary hinders lake area extraction using remote sensing. Furthermore, unquantifiable anthropogenic-natural factors make it difficult to explore the drivers of lake area change. Utilizing Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study employs Landsat series, Sentinel 2, and MOD09GA/MYD09GA data to extract the water area of Ebinur Lake by applying indices such as NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI, and MAWEI. Threshold determination and shoreline refinement are achieved through Otsu's method and the Canny algorithm, followed by a comparative analysis. Monthly spatiotemporal variations between 2009 and 2023 are analyzed using distance-level analysis and center-of-gravity analyses. It is noteworthy that this study adopted PLS-SEM. By comprehensively considering multifactorial interactions, this approach effectively simulates real-world natural scenarios and quantitatively evaluates the complex impacts of hydrology, meteorology, soil-vegetation, and human activities that influence changes in lake area. The results are as follows: (1) MAWEI outperforms NDWI, MNDWI, and AWEI with >95% overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient >0.9, making it the best index for water body extraction; (2) from 2009 to 2017, Ebinur Lake's area gradually increased, falling within a range of 450 km(2) to 900 km(2). Conversely, from 2017 to 2023, the lake's area notably decreased, falling to between 330 km(2) and 880 km(2); (3) Ebinur Lake's center of gravity shifts northwest to southeast, with primary changes in northwest mini-lake and transition zones; (4) hydrological factors were identified as the primary driver of changes in the Ebinur Lake area, contributing 64.3% of the total impact. Soil-vegetation, human activities, and meteorological factors contributed 16.7%, 11.3%, and 7.8%, respectively. The quantified driving factors and the MAWEI-based monitoring framework can directly provide references for water resource allocation policies and ecological restoration priorities in the economic zone of the Tianshan Mountains.

In 1948 there appeared to be ca. 25 % of the number of fish present that were found in 1916. The average total length of the fish had risen from 162 to 243 mm., the average weight from 50 to 180 grams; a gain in size comparable in magnitude to the reduction in numbers. The most rapid changes in size and weight occurred between 1939 and 1948. Changes were caused by: (1) repeated epizootics due to a sporozoan parasite (Myxobolus). (2) temporary decrease in numbers of the Cisco (Leucichthys artedi Le Sueur). Fishing pressure as a cause of the falling off in number appeared to be of minor importance.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1951	32	4					719	728		10.2307/1932737	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932737													WOS:A1951XW60800011

In this study, nine types of agricultural land use were monitored in 2010 and 2011, and a correlation analysis between nutrient losses from agricultural non-point sources (NPS) and nutrient stocks in the lake was conducted over monthly and seasonal time periods. The results indicate that the monthly average concentration of total nitrogen (TN) ranged from 1.41 to 7.34 mg/L in 2010 and from 1.52 to 5.90 mg/L in 2011, while the monthly average concentration of total phosphorous (TP) ranged from 0.11 to 0.26 mg/L in 2010 and from 0.13 to 0.30 mg/L in 2011. The annual loss of TN from agricultural NPS was 195.55 tons in 2010 and 208.40 tons in 2011. The cultivation of water oat made the largest contribution to the loss of TN. The annual loss of TP was 44.58 tons in 2010 and 48.12 tons in 2011, and multi-vegetable cultivation made the largest contribution to the loss of TP. The results of correlation analysis show that the monthly stocks of TN and TP in the lake have a positive correlation with the monthly losses of TN and TP from agricultural NPS. According to the seasonal data, the stocks of TN and TP in the lake both have a much stronger correlation with the losses of TN and TP from agricultural NPS in summer than in other seasons. Agricultural NPS pollution control should be the main focus for the water resource conservation in this area.

Surface and Groundwater in Volcanic Islands: Water from Azores Islands	VOLCANOES OF THE AZORES: REVEALING THE GEOLOGICAL SECRETS OF THE CENTRAL NORTHERN ATLANTIC ISLANDS	Active Volcanos of the World											Small volcanic islands face unique challenges in the assessment and management of their hydrological systems and water resources, which distinguish them from other regions around the world. This chapter summarizes the latest knowledge of the water resources in the Azores Archipelago. Although precipitation is abundant, the Azores islands have poorly developed watersheds and few perennial streams. Most water is contained in volcanic lakes whose geomorphological characteristics are being controlled by volcano-tectonic activity. Some lakes interact with volcanic fluids. Several lakes are subject to anthropogenic pollution, mainly related to agricultural production and/or open air grazing. Lakes on the Azores are under the influence of various chemical processes: (1) sea-salt spraying effect, (2) water-rock interaction due to hydrolysis, and (3) contamination with volcanic fluids. Groundwater is a vital resource in Azores islands for human consumption, agriculture and industry. The occurrence, movement, and storage of groundwater show that heterogeneity and anisotropy directly depend on volcanic eruptions and secondary processes, such as fracturing and weathering. The total volume of groundwater resources in the Azores equals 1.6 x 10(9) m(3)/year. Groundwater occurs in two main aquifer systems: perched and basal aquifer systems. The spatial distribution of springs is very heterogeneous, with densities varying between 0.01 to 0.72 springs/km(2) and median discharge values varying between 1.73 and 36.29 m(3)/day. 160 wells were known, located at distances between 300 and 5825 m from the coastline and had capture depths from 25 to 284 m. The specific flow rates (q) range from 1.4 x 10(-2) to 266.7 L/sm, with a median value equal to 22 L/sm, and transmissivity varies between 1.43 and 34809 m(2)/day, with a median of 3162 m(2)/day. Groundwater chemical composition facies varies from sodium chloride to sodium bicarbonate waters and show low mineralization. Volcanic degasification and hydrothermal steam rising from deeper geothermal systems contribute to the contamination of shallower aquifers resulting in the occurrence of a large number of mineral and thermal waters. With the exception of those sites, associated with active faults and volcanoes, the groundwater quality in some of the Azores islands is mainly deteriorated by salt water intrusion in the coastal aquifers, inland agricultural activities, and the lack of sanitation system.

J	Shin, N; Deng, ZW				Shin, N; Deng, ZW			Space/time features of the secular variation in 1951-1998 northern 500-hPa height	METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS												This paper presents a trend coefficient as a characteristic index with which to investigate the 1951-1998 secular trend variation (STV) of northern 500-hPa height on a seasonal basis. Evidence suggests that low thigh) latitude 500 hPa geopotential height displays a remarkably positive (negative) trend; the positive anomaly of the height is maintained over NW Africa, the western Mediterranean Sea and North Africa, mid-Pacific at lower latitudes, Lake Baikal and area to the east and NW North America; the height drops significantly over the Aleutians and North Pacific, the area to the south of the Greenland and NE North America and the sector to the north of the Arabian Sea. Further, analysis of abrupt change shows that the 500-hPa circulations experience noticeable sudden change twice, once around the early 1960s and again in 1976, during which period the height exhibits great differences between the Pacific and Atlantic. In the first period it drops (rises) over the mid-Atlantic at lower latitudes (NW Africa); in the second period the height rises (drops) over the mid-Pacific at lower latitudes and Lake Baikal (the North Pacific). Statistical tests indicate that in the 1976 case the low-Latitude positive abrupt change is even more noticeable compared to the negative of the North Pacific, thus representing a large-scale jumping event of the northern 500-hPa height.																			0177-7971						2000	73	1-2					35	46		10.1007/s007030050062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s007030050062													WOS:000086034100003

The LULC change detection was done between 2007 and 2021. This study used the supervised classification-maximum likelihood approach in ArcGIS 10.3 software to detect LULC in Loha Taluka, Maharashtra. The taluka was classified into four major LULC classes, viz. water, vegetation, settlement and barren-land. Changes in LULC directly or indirectly will also induce a change in the environmental parameters. Environmental parameters (water surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration and total suspended solids) were analysed for Limboti Reservoir. Data were predicted for next two years (2022 and 2023) using multiplicative seasonal decomposition and Holt-Winter's multiplicative method and trends of each parameter were analysed using Mann-Kendall trend method. For both years, vegetative land was the most extensive LC in Loha Taluka, accounting for more than 60% of the total land area. However, throughout these years, urbanisation was rampant and vegetative land was converted to settlement. In these years, open water resources such as reservoirs, lakes and rivers covered a very small percentage of the total area, which is a serious threat to the ecosystem. As a result, proper water body management is essential; otherwise, these resources will be destroyed and will no longer be able to contribute to the area's socioeconomic growth.

To validate this hypothesis, we explored the use of data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to discriminate the presence and extent of lake ice during the winter of 1990-1991 on the 45 lakes and reservoirs in Wisconsin with a surface area greater than 1,000 hectares. Our results suggest both the feasibility of using the AVHRR to determine the date of lake ice breakup as well as the strong correlation (R = -0.87) of the date so derived with local surface-based temperature measurements. These results suggest the potential of using current and archival satellite data to monitor changes in the date of lake ice breakup as a means of detecting regional ''signals'' of greenhouse warming.

J	Pivot, FC				Pivot, Frederique C.			C-Band SAR Imagery for Snow-Cover Monitoring at Treeline, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada	REMOTE SENSING												RADARSAT and ERS-2 data collected at multiple incidence angles are used to characterize the seasonal variations in the backscatter of snow-covered landscapes in the northern Hudson Bay Lowlands during the winters of 1997/98 and 1998/99. The study evaluates the usefulness of C-band SAR systems for retrieving the snow water equivalent under dry snow conditions in the forest-tundra ecotone. The backscatter values are compared against ground measurements at six sampling sites, which are taken to be representative of the land-cover types found in the region. The contribution of dry snow to the radar return is evident when frost penetrates the first 20 cm of soil. Only then does the backscatter respond positively to changes in snow water equivalent, at least in the open and forested areas near the coast, where 1-dB increases in backscatter for each approximate 5-10 mm of accumulated water equivalent are observed at 20-31. incidence angles. Further inland, the backscatter shows either no change or a negative change with snow accumulation, which suggests that the radar signal there is dominated by ground surface scattering (e.g., fen) when not attenuated by vegetation (e.g., forested and transition). With high-frequency ground-penetrating radar, we demonstrate the presence of a 10-20-cm layer of black ice underneath the snow cover, which causes the reduced radar returns (-15 dB and less) observed in the inland fen. A correlation between the backscattering and the snow water equivalent cannot be determined due to insufficient observations at similar incidence angles. To establish a relationship between the snow water equivalent and the backscatter, only images acquired with similar incidence angles should be used, and they must be corrected for both vegetation and ground effects.																				2072-4292				JUL	2012	4	7					2133	2155		10.3390/rs4072133	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs4072133													WOS:000306759700013
J	FAST, AW; TYLER, PA				FAST, AW; TYLER, PA			THE REESTABLISHMENT OF MEROMIXIS IN HEMLOCK LAKE, MICHIGAN, AFTER ARTIFICIAL DESTRATIFICATION	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The monimolimnion of meromictic Hemlock Lake, Michigan, was eliminated by artificial aeration in 1970. The previous meromictic condition was described earlier and is reviewed herein. Aeration resulted in removing the anoxic monimolimnion, and during the autumnal overturn the entire water column became oxygenated and homothermal. In 1971, after cessation of aeration, a return to meromixis set in during the summer months. Aeration had caused the disappearance of H2S and of green bacteria, and had allowed invasion of the entire lake bottom by crayfish, trout, etc., but during 1971 these disappeared from the developing monimolimnion. Previous to aeration the lake had been slightly dichothermic, with bottom temperatures slightly higher than those in the remainder of the monimolimnion. Dichothermy did not develop again after aeration during the period of investigation. A comparison is made with meromictic conditions in a reservoir bottom pool, Lake Barrington, Tasmania.																			0020-9309						1981	66	5					665	674		10.1002/iroh.19810660503	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19810660503													WOS:A1981MS17000002

Daily, seasonal, and annual variability of temperature in streams inhabited by the endemic San Pedro Martir trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss nelsoni), in Baja California, Mexico, and the predicted temperature for the years 2025 and 2050	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The present study measured the daily, seasonal, and annual variability of the water temperature of streams in which the endemic rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss nelsoni, is distributed on the western slope of the Sierra San Pedro Martir, Baja California, Mexico, between 1996 and 2019. The seasonal thermal interval and daily duration of summer temperatures above the thermal threshold for this trout subspecies (>= 28 degrees C) were determined in streams at different elevations (553, 1,220, and 2,080 m asl, or meters above sea level). Temperatures 28 degrees C were recorded at the study site on the stream with the lowest elevation (San Antonio de Murillos Creek) over an accumulated 365 h between June and September 2014, with the maximum temperature recorded there, 30.66 degrees C, making it the site most vulnerable to global warming. At the San Antonio de Murillos Creek site, the average water temperature predicted by three models (GFDL R30, HadCM3, and Mote) for the year 2025 would be a non-lethal temperature, <28 degrees C, for trout at a minimum elevation of 491-511 masl, while this was predicted to be 545-701 masl for the year 2050. Predicted hourly water temperatures of 28 degrees C (non-lethal) may occur at minimum elevations of 868-898 masl in 2025 and at 908-1028 masl in 2050, reducing a 21-23% and 23-31% its current altitudinal distribution range, respectively, thus avoiding its presence at the type locality (San Antonio de Murillos).

Drought and the collapse of the Tiwanaku Civilization: New evidence from Lake Orurillo, Peru	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Tiwanaku was a regionally significant, state level polity in the south-central Andes from ca. 500e1000 CE. The development of complex society in the region was greatly facilitated through intensified agricultural systems that relied on monsoonal precipitation. At the end of the first millennium CE, the Tiwanaku political regime collapsed, and their raised field systems were mostly abandoned within 200 years or less. It has been suggested that a prolonged period of aridity contributed to the collapse, but questions have remained about its chronology and severity. In this study, we investigated the relationship between d2Hwax and d18Ocalcite values, aridity and societal change. A period of nondeposition or erosion occurred between 915 and 1025 CE indicating a low lake stand exposing the core site. This extended and pronounced drought ending 1025 CE was recorded in the isotopic proxies extracted from lake sediments that show this period of aridity persisted into the 13th century. The broad agreement between our record and other regional paleoenvironmental archives of Holocene climate variability is consistent with Northern Hemisphere oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns as a mechanism for driving centennial scale climate change in the Andes and supports the correspondence between prolonged drought and the collapse of Tiwanaku.

Biome reconstruction suggests a dominance of temperate steppe vegetation (mainly Artemisia and Poaceae) on the central Tibetan Plateau during the first half of the Holocene (10.8-4.4 cal. ka BP), while alpine steppes with desert elements (mainly Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, and characteristic high-alpine herb families) tend to dominate the second half (4.4-0 cal. ka BP). The Artemisia/Cyperaceae ratio-a semi-quantitative measure for summer temperature-indicates a general cooling trend throughout the Holocene. Dense temperate steppe vegetation and maximum desert plant withdrawal, however, indicate that a suitable balance of wet and warm conditions for optimum vegetation growth likely occurred during the middle Holocene (7.3-4.4 cal. ka BP). Severe Early Holocene cold events have been reconstructed for 8.7-8.3 and similar to 7.4 cal. ka BP. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Model calibration was accomplished using data collected from 1981 until 1996 to encompass extreme climatic conditions. Simulation results suggest that wetland inflows are dominated by runoff (36%), direct precipitation to the lake (45%) and groundwater inflows (19%), while outflow from the wetland is primarily evaporation (84%) and groundwater discharge to the underlying aquifer (16%). Modeled surface runoff produces short duration, high magnitude flows typically associated with spring thaw while modeled groundwater provides flows smaller in magnitude but Ion-er in duration that may be increasingly important to wetland stage during extended periods of drought and flood. Despite an oversimplification of the complex groundwater component of the wetland system it was found that this modeling approach was able to predict system response over 16 years under extreme climatic conditions.					; Tracy, John/ABD-2930-2020; Carroll, Rachel/I-1417-2019	Tracy, John/0009-0009-8102-4867; 													1084-0699					JAN-FEB	2005	10	1					70	84		10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2005)10:1(70)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2005)10:1(70)													WOS:000225805300008

We find that the early, middle, and late Holocene were punctuated by periods wet enough to establish large pluvial lakes in currently dry basins in the Chihuahuan Desert; the largest dated pluvial lake covered similar to 5650 km(2) during the early Holocene. Constructional beach ridges in these subbasins are 221 +/- 33 C-14 yr B.P. (Little Ice Age equivalent), 3815 +/- 52 to 4251 +/- 59 C-14 yr B.P.

(early Holocene), dates that correlate with other millennially spaced wet or cold events in the Northern Hemisphere. We attribute these wet episodes to increased precipitation, cooler temperatures, and reduced evaporation following southward shifts in winter storm tracks, which are related to long-term El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability during the Holocene.																			0091-7613					FEB	2006	34	2					113	116		10.1130/G22036.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G22036.1													WOS:000235224000013

In Lake IJssel the catches of pikeperch, Stizostedion lucioperca, in 101 mm gillnets show the largest variability, compared with the variability in the catches of perch, Perca fluviatilis, in these nets and of eel, Anguilla anguilla, in fykenets. Variability in recruitment is the major cause of annual variation in the catch of pikeperch and perch. Year-class strength of pikeperch is highly correlated with summer temperature. Effort limitation provides a marginal gain in stabilising the annual catch in the Lake IJssel pikeperch and perch fishery. In spite of severe over-exploitation, the total outcome of the Lake IJssel fishery has been stable over the last decade, because of the low variability in the catches of eel and because all together four species are exploited.																			0028-2960						1992	42	2-3					500	511																WOS:A1992KD55800026

Distinct temporal patterns and sudden changes in lake areas and ET were observed, with Qinghai Lake showing an upward trend in the summer area and a mutation in 2020, while ET exhibited a mutation in 2021. Cyclic characteristics were observed, with significant correlations noted during specific periods, indicating a strong positive phase relationship between lake area and ET.

Highly Efficient Photochemical Vapor Generation for Sensitive Determination of Iridium by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Herein, we describe the highly efficient photochemical vapor generation (PVG) of a volatile species of Ir (presumably iridium tetracarbonyl hydride) for subsequent detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). A thin-film flow-through photo-reactor, operated in flow injection mode, provided high efficiency following optimization of identified key PVG parameters, notably, irradiation time, pH of the reaction medium, and the presence of metal sensitizers. For routine use and analytical application, PVG conditions comprising 4 M formic acid as the reaction medium, the presence of 10 mg L-1 Co2+ and 25 mg L-1 Cd2+ as added sensitizers, and an irradiation time of 29 s were chosen. An almost 90% overall PVG efficiency for both Ir3+ and Ir4+ oxidation states was accompanied by excellent repeatability of 1.0% (n = 15) of the peak area response from a 50 ng L-1 Ir standard. Limits of detection ranged from 3 to 6 pg L-1 (1.5-3 fg absolute), dependent on use of the ICPMS reaction/collision cell. Interferences from several transition metals and metalloids as well as inorganic acids and their anions were investigated, and outstanding tolerance toward chloride was found. Accuracy of the developed methodology was verified by analysis of NIST SRM 2556 (Used Auto Catalyst) following peroxide fusion for sample preparation. Practical application was further demonstrated by the direct analysis of spring water, river water, lake water, and two seawater samples with around 100% spike recovery and no sample preparation except the addition of formic acid and the sensitizers.

This sensitivity is reflected in the dilute chemistry of the lakes, which was documented in the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's Western Lake Survey of 1985. Sixty-nine lakes in seven national parks sampled during the 1985 survey were resampled during fall 1999 to investigate possible decadal-scale changes in lake chemistry. In most lakes, SO4 concentrations were slightly lower in 1999 than in 1985, consistent with a regional decrease in precipitation SO4 concentrations and in SO2 emissions in the western United States. Nitrate concentrations also tended to be slightly lower in 1999 than in 1985, in contrast with generally stable or increasing inorganic N deposition in the west. Differences in alkalinity were variable among parks but were relatively consistent within each park. Possible effects of annual and seasonal-scale variations in precipitation amount on lake chemistry were evaluated based on climate data available for the parks and an analysis of climatic effects at two research watersheds with long-term records. Results suggest that rain prior to sampling in 1985 may have caused elevated NO3 in some lakes due to direct runoff of precipitation and flushing of NO3 from alpine soils, which may explain some of the decrease in NO3 concentrations observed in survey lakes.

Rock flour produced during glacier advances is represented by clay-sized plagioclase, K-feldspar, and biotite in homogeneous internal composition. The abundance of rock flour is deemed proportional to the intensity of glacies advances. Age control for the composite section is provided by combining previously published radiocarbon dates on organics, U/Th dates on ostracode shells, and U/Th dates on saline minerals from nearby Searles Lake correlated to OL92 by pollen. The rack flour record displays three levels of variability: (1) a dominant one of about 20,000 yr related to summer insolation and precipitation; (2) an intermediate one of 3000-5000 yr, perhaps related to North Atlantic Heinrich events; and (3) a minor one of 1000-2000 yr, perhaps related to North Atlantic thermohaline-driven air-temperature variation, (C) 2001 University of Washington.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2001	55	1					14	24		10.1006/qres.2000.2183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/qres.2000.2183													WOS:000167410300003
C	Eckmann, R		Wanzenbock, J; Winfield, IJ		Eckmann, Reiner			A review of the population dynamics of coregonids in European alpine lakes	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2011	Advances in Limnology				11th International Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	SEP 26-30, 2011	Mondsee, AUSTRIA	Austrian Acad Sci, Austrian Fed Minist Sci & Res, Prov Govt Upper Austria, Community Mondsee				The population dynamics of coregonids in European alpine lakes have been studied intensively during recent decades. Many of these studies have focussed on the impacts of anthropogenic eutrophication and subsequent re-oligotrophication. These changes in productivity represent the single most important perturbation of coregonid habitats since the mid-twentieth century. While the problem of eutrophication has been successfully addressed in many European alpine lakes, new forms of anthropogenic challenge such as climate change and the colonization of lakes by non-native aquatic species continue to impact on coregonid populations and demand research. The picture that emerges from a compilation of primary research papers suggests that abiotic and biotic factors are most influential on year-class strength during the larval phase, exerting more moderate effects during the embryonic and reproductive phases, and only a weak influence during the growth phase. In contrast, individual biomass is mainly determined during the growth phase, but moderate effects on growth may also occur during the larval and reproductive phases. Changes in lake productivity influence the various life-history phases of coregonids in both positive and negative ways, for example by improving feeding conditions and via deterioration of spawning habitat quality. Climate change, on the other hand, seems to influence mainly the embryonic and larval phases, with the available studies suggesting that higher temperatures and earlier onset of stratification in spring tend to boost year-class strength. These effects, however, appear insufficient to balance the marked effects of re-oligotrophication, which has caused and continues to cause a marked depression of growth in many European alpine lakes. The bumper fish harvests obtained during the peak of anthropogenic eutrophication are thus a thing of the past.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47066-2				2013	64						3	24		10.1127/1612-166X/2013/0064-0002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1612-166X/2013/0064-0002													WOS:000328231900002
J	Nowak, GM; Quinn, TP				Nowak, GM; Quinn, TP			Diel and seasonal patterns of horizontal and vertical movements of telemetered cutthroat trout in Lake Washington, Washington	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Salmonid fishes are often the top predators in cool lakes, and their movements may reflect the distribution of available prey as well as physical factors such as light and temperature. We used ultrasonic telemetry to examine the vertical and horizontal movement patterns of cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki in Lake Washington, a monomictic lake in Washington State. We hypothesized that the trout would show seasonal shifts in vertical distribution, balancing avoidance of warm surface waters with the need to forage on vertically migrating limnetic planktivores, During the lake's annual stratification period, the trout avoided the near-surface waters (mean fish depth = 15.7 m); however, the trout were nearer to the surface when the lake was mixed (mean fish depth 7.5 m), consistent with a thermal constraint. The trout did not show notable diel changes in behavior, either in depth or swimming speed. Rather, they swam, about 0.5 body lengths per second in open water during the day and were only somewhat slower at night, with fewer vertical excursions, No home ranges were evident, as trout moved throughout the lake, Foraging in littoral areas occurred primarily in spring and exclusively during daylight hours, The results are consistent with foraging by large cutthroat trout in the limnetic zone on the lake's dominant planktivores, juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka and longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys. Cutthroat trout behavior contrasted sharply with results fur sympatric rainbow trout O. mykiss, which occupied the warmer surface waters and the littoral zone and which showed a more pronounced diurnal activity pattern.																			0002-8487					MAY	2002	131	3					452	462		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0452:DASPOH>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0452:DASPOH>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000175453300008

Simulating a Spill of Diluted Bitumen: Environmental Weathering and Submergence in a Model Freshwater System	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The main petroleum product transported through pipelines in Canada is diluted bitumen (dilbit), a semiliquid form of heavy crude oil mixed with natural gas condensates to facilitate transport. The weathering, fate, behavior, and environmental effects of dilbit are crucial to consider when responding to a spill; however, few environmental studies on dilbit have been completed. We report on 11-d-long experimental spills of dilbit (Cold Lake Winter Blend) in outdoor microcosms meant to simulate a low-energy aquatic system containing natural lake water and sediments treated with low (1:8000 oil:water) and high (1:800 oil:water) volumes of dilbit. In the first 24 h of the experiment, volatile hydrocarbons quickly evaporated from the dilbit, resulting in increased dilbit density and viscosity. These changes in dilbit's physical and chemical properties ultimately led to its submergence after 8 d. We also detected rapid accumulation of polycyclic aromatic compounds in the water column of the treated microcosms following the spills. The present study provides new information on the environmental fate and behavior of dilbit in a freshwater environment that will be critical to environmental risk assessments of proposed pipeline projects. In particular, the study demonstrates the propensity for dilbit to sink under ambient environmental conditions in freshwaters typical of many boreal lakes. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2621-2628.

Temperature, Precipitation, and Lightning Modification in the Vicinity of the Athabasca Oil Sands	EARTH INTERACTIONS												The Athabasca oil sands development in northeast Alberta, Canada, has disturbed more than 500 km(2) of boreal forest through surface mining and tailings ponds development. In this paper, the authors compare the time series of temperatures and precipitation measured over oil sands and non-oil sands locations from 1994 to 2010. In addition, they analyzed the distribution of lightning strikes from 1999 to 2010. The oil sands development has not affected the number of lightning strikes or precipitation amounts but has affected the temperature regime. Over the past 17 years, the summer overnight minimum temperatures near the oil sands have increased by about 1.2 degrees C compared to the regional average. The authors speculate that this is caused by a combination of the industrial addition of waste heat to the atmosphere above the oil sands and changing the surface type from boreal forest to open pit mines with tailings ponds.					; Brown, Daniel/AAT-6490-2020	Flesch, Thomas/0000-0003-3993-6036; 														1087-3562				DEC	2011	15								32	10.1175/2011EI412.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2011EI412.1													WOS:000300612700001

We determined its distribution over a 250 km stretch of the St. Lawrence River (SLR; Quebec, Canada) to elaborate predictive models of its presence and biomass based on chemical and physical characteristics. A 2008 survey revealed L. wollei was generally found downstream of the inflow of small tributaries draining farmlands. As enriched waters flowed slowly through dense submerged vegetation, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration dropped but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) remained high, leading to a low DIN: TDP ratio. Models identified DOC (positive effect), TP (negative effect), and DIN:TDP (negative effect) as the most important variables explaining L. wollei distribution. The risk of L. wollei occurrence in the SLR was correctly forecasted in 72%-92% of all cases with an independent data set. Proliferation of L. wollei, a potentially heterotrophic, diazotrophic cyanobacterium, is favoured by organic enrichment and imbalance of DIN:TDP ratio. Its dominance coincided with low macrophyte biomass, yielding a simplified, less productive ecosystem.

However, these studies mainly focus on the epilimnion and little is known regarding the bacterioplankton inhabiting the hypolimnion of deep holomictic lakes, despite its biogeochemical importance. In this study, we investigated the bacterioplankton community composition in a deep freshwater lake with a fully oxygenated hypolimnion (Lake Biwa, Japan) using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sampling at a pelagic site over 15 months throughout the water column revealed that the community composition in the hypolimnion was significantly different from that in the epilimnion. The bacterial community in the hypolimnion was composed of groups dominating in the whole water layer (e. g., bacI-A1 and acI-B1) and groups that were hypolimnion habitat specialists. Among the hypolimnion specialists, members of Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes were highly represented (e. g., CL500-11, CL500-15 and CL500-37), followed by members of Acidobacteria, Chlorobi and nitrifiers (e. g., Ca. Nitrosoarchaeum, Nitrosospira and Nitrospira). This study identified the number of previously understudied taxa dominating the deep aerobic freshwater habitat, suggesting that the biogeochemical cycling there is driven by the microbial community that are different from that in the epilimnion.

Functional Data Analysis in Ecosystem Research: The Decline of Oweekeno Lake Sockeye Salmon and Wannock River Flow	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS												Functional regression is a natural tool for exploring the potential impact of the physical environment (continuously monitored) on biological processes (often only assessed annually). This paper explores the potential use of functional regression analysis and the closely related functional principal component analysis for studying the relationship between river flow (continuously monitored) and salmon abundance (measured annually). The specific example involves a depressed sockeye salmon population in Rivers Inlet, BC. Particular attention is given to (i) the role of subject matter expertise and cross-validation techniques in guiding decisions on basis functions and smoothing parameters, and (ii) the importance of restricting the time domain for the continuously monitored variable to a scientifically meaningful period of time. In addition, we derive a joint confidence region for the functional regression coefficient function and discuss its use relative to the more commonly used pointwise confidence intervals. The analysis points to a substantial negative correlation between early spring river flow and marine survival of the sockeye salmon that subsequently migrate down the inlet.

In a lake setting, frazil is a surface phenomenon, the strong downward current produced by a swirling flow, with an intake vortex present, provides a mechanism by which frazil is transported from the water surface to the submerged intake below. Laboratory experiments were conducted to study the entrainment envelope associated with swirling and non-swirling flows into submerged water intakes. Three-dimensional velocity measurements were made with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. The results clearly show that the entrainment envelope for swirling flow is several times larger than that for non-swirling flow. This paper details, for a given set of conditions, the differences in the non-swirling and swirling flow entrainment envelopes and emphasizes the potential difficulties with frazil ice that vortices can cause at intakes.

The reconstruction was performed using simple 2D and 3D models based on friction cone theory and robust 3D models considering complex geometry of collapsed material and detailed ground topography. The research suggests that one large block was detached about 100 m above the road level, fragmenting along the route and transforming into a pile of rubble with large sized boulders.

The differences in the percentage of different forms of diatoms and microresidues of higher plants have been revealed. The comparison of diatom complexes in the studied samples with analogous data on sediments in large lakes of Kamchatka attests to fundamental differences between these objects. Two genera of diatoms (Cyclotella and Stephanodiscus) are absent or are found in insignificant amounts in floodplain and oxbow alluvium.

There is increasing concern regarding how climate change will affect lake-water thermal structure and lake-ice characteristics, particularly ice formation, duration, break-up, thickness, and composition. This study employs a one-dimensional process-based multi-year lake ice model, MyLake, to simulate the evolution of the Northern Hemisphere lake-ice and thermal structure patterns under a changing climate. After testing the model on Baker Lake located in Nunavut Canada, large-scale simulations were conducted over the major land masses of the Northern Hemisphere subarctic regions between 40 degrees and 75 degrees N using hypothetical lakes positioned at 2.5 degrees latitude and longitude resolution. For the baseline period of 1960-1999, the lake-ice model was driven by gridded atmospheric forcings from the ERA-40 global reanalysis data set while atmospheric model forcings corresponding to future (2040-2079) climate were obtained by modifying the ERA-40 data according to the Canadian Global Climate Model projection based on the SRES A2 emissions scenario. Analysis of the modelling results indicates that lake-ice freeze-up timing will be delayed by 5-20 days and break-up will be advanced by approximately 10-30 days, thereby resulting in an overall decrease in lake-ice duration by about 15-50 days. Maximum lake-ice thickness will also be reduced by 10-50 cm. The change in maximum snow depth on the lake-ice ranges between -15 to +5 cm, while the change in white-ice thickness ranges between -20 to +10 cm depending on the geographic location and other climate parameters. The future warming will also result in an overall increase in lake-water temperature, with summer stratification starting earlier and extending later into the year.

Multivariate statistic and time series analyses of grain-size data in quaternary sediments of Lake El'gygytgyn, NE Russia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Lake El'gygytgyn, located in the Far East Russian Arctic, was formed by a meteorite impact about 3.58 Ma ago. In 2009, the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) at Lake El'gygytgyn obtained a continuous sediment sequence of the lacustrine deposits and the upper part of the impact breccia. Here, we present grain-size data of the past 2.6 Ma. General downcore grain-size variations yield coarser sediments during warm periods and finer ones during cold periods. According to principal component analysis (PCA), the climate-dependent variations in grain-size distributions mainly occur in the coarse silt and very fine silt fraction. During interglacial periods, accumulation of coarser material in the lake center is caused by redistribution of clastic material by a wind-induced current pattern during the ice-free period. Sediment supply to the lake is triggered by the thickness of the active layer in the catchment and the availability of water as a transport medium. During glacial periods, sedimentation at Lake El'gygytgyn is hampered by the occurrence of a perennial ice cover, with sedimentation being restricted to seasonal moats and vertical conduits through the ice. Thus, the summer temperature predominantly triggers transport of coarse material into the lake center. Time series analysis that was carried out to gain insight into the frequency of the grain-size data showed variations predominately on 98.5, 40.6, and 22.9 kyr oscillations, which correspond to Milankovitch's eccentricity, obliquity and precession bands. Variations in the relative power of these three oscillation bands during the Quaternary suggest that sedimentation processes at Lake El'gygytgyn are dominated by environmental variations caused by global glacial-interglacial variations (eccentricity, obliquity), and local insolation forcing and/or latitudinal teleconnections (precession), respectively.

The sediment particle size, organic carbon content, and pH were determined in the lake sediments in addition to the determination of the spatial distribution of heavy metals, as well as the metal enrichment levels for the sediment. The results of the metal analysis obtained using the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique indicated that the metal levels in Lake Cildir and spring waters which feed the lake were identified as Class 1 water quality according to the Turkish Surface Water Quality Regulation limits. Although the Ni and Cr levels found in the sediment were higher than some Sediment Quality Guideline (SQG) limits, the Ni and Cr levels of the core samples representing past periods provided no indication of enrichment for these elements.

Estimates of evapotranspiration from contrasting Wisconsin peatlands based on diel water table oscillations	ECOHYDROLOGY												Evapotranspiration rates (ET) from contrasting Wisconsin bogs (one forested bog, one open bog) were compared over 4 years by analyzing diel oscillations of their water tables. Daily rates of ET from peatlands were also compared to rates of evaporation (E) from encircled bog ponds. We hypothesized that ET would be higher in the forested bog due to the greater leaf area index of forest canopy relative to moss and ericaceous shrubs. We also hypothesized that ET in peatlands would exceed the physical process of E from encircled ponds. Field data supported the first hypothesis, but the second only proved true for the forested peatland. Daily estimates of peatland ET varied widely, ranging from similar to 1 to > 10 mm/d; but average ET was higher in the forested peatland (4.04 vs. 3.09 mm/d; p < .01). Average ET in the forested peatland was also higher than E during summer (4.04 vs. 3.31 mm/d; p <.05); whereas in the open peatland, average ET was slightly lower than E for all measured seasons (p <.01). Methodologically, the performance of three equations used to estimate ET from daily water table fluctuations was similar. The specific yield of peat (S*y), which is a critical variable in all three equations, was found to be an exponential function of water table depth; and absent an empirically derived S*y, errors in estimates of peatland ET can be large. Given landscape composition across this northern temperate region (13% lakes, 20% peatland, and 54% upland forest) and estimates of forest ET gleaned from the literature, our findings suggest that the regional feedback of water to the atmosphere increases from open waters to peatlands to upland forest, consistent with prior observations that the biological process of transpiration dominates continental ET.

J	Liermann, S; Beylich, AA; van Welden, A				Liermann, Susan; Beylich, Achim A.; van Welden, Aurelien			Contemporary suspended sediment transfer and accumulation processes in the small proglacial Saetrevatnet sub-catchment, Bodalen, western Norway	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A combination of different process monitoring, lake sediment coring and sediment analysis methods and techniques was applied in the 17.5 km(2) Saetrevatnet sub-catchment in the upper Bodalen drainage basin (Nordfjord, western Norway) in order to define hydro-meteorological controls on runoff, suspended sediment transfer and sediment accumulation, and to determine the role of Lake Saetrevatnet within the drainage basin-wide sediment routing system. The proglacial system shows the typical seasonal and weather-depended runoff variations for glacierized drainage basins. Significant suspended sediment transport is associated to summer glacier melt (when 61.9% of the annual suspended sediment yield was recorded in 2010) as well as to single rainfall events (when 19.8% of the annual suspended sediment yield was recorded in 2010). The intensity of atmospheric energy input and the frequency of heavy rainfall events were found to be critical for the rate of suspended sediment transport within the Saetrevatnet sub-catchment. The computed annual suspended sediment yield from the proglacial area was 24.2 t km(-2), which is notably lower as compared with a number of other glacierized basins worldwide. Delta accumulations rates from 2009 (4 cm yr(-1)) and 2010 (3 cm yr(-1)) as well as average annual delta advance ranging from 3.8 m to 4.6 m confirm the calculated high annual lake sedimentation rate of 1.7 cm yr(-1). Lake Saetrevatnet (0.02 km(2)) currently traps about 80-85% of the sediments delivered from the upstream-located glacial system highlighting the importance of small ephemeral proglacial lakes within larger valley-fjord sediment routing systems.

J	Li, XH; Ye, XC				Li, Xianghu; Ye, Xuchun			Variability of Rainfall Erosivity and Erosivity Density in the Ganjiang River Catchment, China: Characteristics and Influences of Climate Change	ATMOSPHERE												Soil erosion is one of the most critical environmental hazards in the world. Understanding the changes in rainfall erosivity (RE) and erosivity density (ED), as well as their affecting factors, at local and catchment scales in the context of climate warming is an important prerequisite of soil erosion prevention and soil loss risk assessment. The present study identified the variability and trends of RE and ED in terms of both time and space in the Ganjiang River catchment over the period of 1960-2012, and also analyzed and discussed the impact of climate change. The results show that RE and ED in the catchment had great monthly variations and high year-to-year variability. Both presented long-term increasing trends over the entire study period. The highest RE and ED were observed in June and in the eastern and northeast parts of the catchment, which indicated that June was the most susceptible month for soil erosion in this area and the lower reaches of the Ganjiang River was the riskiest area for soil erosion. Finally, the East Asian summer monsoon and climate change were highly correlated with changes in RE and ED.

J	Simon, J; Dörner, H				Simon, Janek; Doerner, Hendrik			Survival and growth of European eels stocked as glass- and farm-sourced eels in five lakes in the first years after stocking	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												European eels Anguilla anguilla stocked as wild-sourced glass eels showed a better overall performance of growth and survival compared with farm-sourced eels after stocking in five isolated lakes within a 7-year study period. Eels stocked as farm eels lost their initial size advantage over eels stocked as glass eels within 3-5years after stocking. Population sizes estimated for consecutive stocking batches indicated that 8-17% of eels stocked as farm eels survived 3-6years after stocking compared with 5-45% of eels stocked as glass eels. This study coupled with results of previous studies suggests that stocking of farm eels may have no advantage in growth and survival compared with stocking of glass eels if stocking occurs at an optimal time in spring. In addition, the use of relatively expensive farm eels may provide no general advantage over stocking of glass eels. However, if glass eels are only available for stocking purposes very early in the year, lower survival rates than obtained in the present study can be assumed and stocking with relatively more expensive farm eels could possibly be a better option.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2014	23	1			SI		40	48		10.1111/eff.12050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12050													WOS:000328213900006
J	ARHEIMER, B; WITTGREN, HB				ARHEIMER, B; WITTGREN, HB			MODELING THE EFFECTS OF WETLANDS ON REGIONAL NITROGEN TRANSPORT	AMBIO												Created wetlands have been suggested as a method to reduce nitrogen transport to the Baltic Sea. This paper presents a dynamic conceptual model for simulation of the hypothetical effect of wetlands on nitrogen export to the coastal zone. The study was performed in the Soder-kopingsan drainage basin (882 km(2)) in southeastern Sweden, discharging into the Baltic Sea. An empirically based routine for wetland retention was calibrated separately and incorporated in the model. Scenarios with different location and size of wetlands were analyzed. It was estimated that conversion of 1% (8.8 km(2)) of this basin into wetlands would reduce the nitrogen transport by 10-16% and that more than 5% (45 km(2)) conversion to wetlands is required to reduce the transport by 50%. It was concluded that creation of wetlands should be considered, primarily, downstream from major lakes, in coastal areas, and where the summer load is a significant portion of the annual load. Some further conclusions from the study were that: i) the net reduction of nitrogen transport per unit area of wetland decreases with increasing total area of wetlands in a drainage basin; ii) the wetland retention efficiency obtained in studies of individual wetlands can not be extrapolated in a linear fashion to estimate the net reduction of nitrogen transport at the mouth of a whole drainage basin; iii) the seasonal hydrological and hydrochemical dynamics are of fundamental importance for wetland retention efficiency, which complicates comparison and extrapolation of results from one region to another.

EXCHANGE Consortium	Biogeochemistry of upland to wetland soils, sediments, and surface waters across Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes coastal interfaces	SCIENTIFIC DATA												Transferable and mechanistic understanding of cross-scale interactions is necessary to predict how coastal systems respond to global change. Cohesive datasets across geographically distributed sites can be used to examine how transferable a mechanistic understanding of coastal ecosystem control points is. To address the above research objectives, data were collected by the EXploration of Coastal Hydrobiogeochemistry Across a Network of Gradients and Experiments (EXCHANGE) Consortium - a regionally distributed network of researchers that collaborated on experimental design, methodology, collection, analysis, and publication. The EXCHANGE Consortium collected samples from 52 coastal terrestrial-aquatic interfaces (TAIs) during Fall of 2021. At each TAI, samples collected include soils from across a transverse elevation gradient (i.e., coastal upland forest, transitional forest, and wetland soils), surface waters, and nearshore sediments across research sites in the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions (Chesapeake and Delaware Bays) of the continental USA. The first campaign measures surface water quality parameters, bulk geochemical parameters on water, soil, and sediment samples, and physicochemical parameters of sediment and soil.					; stetten, lucie/ABF-3661-2021; Pennington, Stephanie/KZU-2619-2024; Mozdzer, Thomas/A-3599-2014; Ward, Nicholas/HGB-9389-2022	Patel, Kaizad F./0000-0001-6437-7809; Day, Donnie/0000-0001-9454-7602; Pennington, Stephanie/0000-0003-2685-1092; Song, Bongkeun/0000-0002-6645-7025; Pratt, Dannielle/0000-0002-6796-6227; Kirwan, Matthew/0000-0002-0658-3038; Myers-Pigg, Allison N./0000-0002-6905-6841; Sandborn, Daniel/0000-0001-9653-2287; Homolka, Khadijah/0000-0002-5208-8740; Roebuck, Jesse/0000-0002-8575-2572; Mozdzer, Thomas/0000-0002-1053-0967; 														2052-4463				NOV 24	2023	10	1							822	10.1038/s41597-023-02548-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02548-7								38001085					WOS:001107565000002

Modeling biogeochemical processes in a freshwater lake during the spring thermal bar	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This article describes a coupled physical-biological model for reproducing the ecological processes in a freshwater lake during the evolution of the thermal bar, a phenomenon of sinking of maximum density waters in a narrow zone. The biological part of the model includes 10 prognostic variables: nitrate, phosphate, ammonium, chlorophyll a, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and nitrate and phosphate detritus of small and large sizes. The results of modeling of hydrodynamic processes in Barguzin Bay of Lake Baikal using meteorological data for June 2019 demonstrate a short-term period of the thermal bar existence. The analysis of spatial distributions of biochemical variables of the model showed that the thermal bar acts as a natural barrier limiting the transfer of phosphates and plankton to the open lake.

J	Li, W; Zhang, TL; Li, ZJ				Li Wei; Zhang Tanglin; Li Zhongjie			Spatial distribution and abundance of small fishes in Xiaosihai Lake, a shallow lake along the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, China	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Spatial distribution and abundance of small fishes were studied in autumn 2007 in the Xiaosihai Lake, a shallow lake along the middle reach of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River. Based on the plant cover, the lake was divided into three major habitats: Myriophyllum spicatum habitat (MS habitat), Trapa bispinosa habitat (TB habitat), and non-vegetation habitat (NV habitat). A modified pop-net was used for quantitative sampling of small fishes in the three habitats, and the Zippin's removal method was used for estimating densities of the small fishes. A total of 13 species belonging to 5 families were collected, with 11 species in MS habitat, 7 species in TB habitat, and 5 species in NV habitat. Habitat type had significant effect on the spatial distribution of small fishes. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index in the MS, TB and NV habitats were 1.28, 0.56 and 0.54, respectively. The total density and biomass of small fishes were significantly higher in the MS habitat (13.68 ind/m(2) and 4.44 g/m(2)) than in the TB habitat (1.41 ind/m(2) and 0.54 g/m(2)) and the NV habitat (1.08 ind/m(2) and 0.40 g/m(2)), and were not significantly different between the TB habitat and the NV habitat. Water depth had no significant effect on spatial distribution of the small fishes. It was suggested that vegetation type played an important role in habitat selectivity of small fishes, and the presence of submersed vegetation should be of significance in the conservation of small fish diversity.

An evaluation of Thiomicrospira, Hydrogenovibrio and Thioalkalimicrobium: reclassification of four species of Thiomicrospira to each Thiomicrorhabdus gen. nov and Hydrogenovibrio, and reclassification of all four species of Thioalkalimicrobium to Thiomicrospira	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												Thiomicrospira (Tms) species are small sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophic members of the Gammaproteobacteria. Whilst the type species Tms. pelophila and closely related Tms. thyasirae exhibit canonical spiral morphology under sub-optimal growth conditions, most species are vibrios or rods. The 16S rRNA gene diversity is vast, with identities as low as 91.6% for Tms. pelophila versus Tms. frisia, for example. Thiomicrospira was examined with closely related genera Hydrogenovibrio and Thioalkalimicrobium and, to rationalize organisms on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, physiology and morphology, we reclassify Tms. kuenenii, Tms. crunogena, Tms. thermophila and Tms. halophila to Hydrogenovibrio kuenenii comb. nov., H. crunogenus corrig. comb. nov., H. thermophilus corrig. comb. nov. and H. halophilus corrig. comb. nov. We reclassify Tms. frisia, Tms. arctica, Tms. psychrophila and Tms. chilensis to Thiomicrorhabdus (Tmr) gen. nov., as Tmr. frisia comb. nov., Tmr. arctica comb. nov., Tmr. psychrophila comb. nov. and Tmr. chilensis comb. nov. - the type species of Thiomicrorhabdus is Tmr. frisia. We demonstrate that Thioalkalimicrobium species fall within the genus Thiomicrospira sensu stricto, thus reclassifying them as Tms. aerophila corrig. comb. nov., Tms. microaerophila corrig. comb. nov., Tms. cyclica corrig. comb. nov. and Tms. sibirica corrig. comb. nov.

Since their dominant form of recruitment is vegetative reproduction, entangled fragments on boats and trailers can establish new populations. The effectiveness of recreational boats as transport vectors relies on the resistance of macrophytes to air exposure. During the summers of 2012 and 2013, we conducted five field experiments in northern Wisconsin to assess air tolerance of Eurasian water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and curly-leaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus). We simulated conditions that these plants would experience when ensnared on boats and trailers by testing viability after drying of single stems, coiled stems, and vegetative buds (turions). Single stems of M. spicatum and P. crispus were viable for up to 18 and 12 h of air exposure, respectively. Coiling extended the viability of M. spicatum to 48 h of air exposure. Turions of P. crispus successfully sprouted after 28 days of drying. The fact that recreational boaters in the region typically visit multiple lakes within a few days suggests that most lakes are susceptible to introduction of viable plants, and so lake managers should continue to focus attention on boat cleaning.					; Bruckerhoff, Lindsey/JAX-6797-2023	Bruckerhoff, Lindsey/0000-0002-9523-4808; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2015	746	1					113	121		10.1007/s10750-014-1947-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1947-9													WOS:000348186600008
J	Reimann, C; Banks, D				Reimann, C; Banks, D			Setting action levels for drinking water: Are we protecting our health or our economy (or our backs!)?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Clean and healthy drinking water is important for life. Drinking water can be drawn from streams, lakes and rivers, directly collected (and stored) from rain, acquired by desalination of ocean water and melting of ice or it can be extracted from groundwater resources. Groundwater may reach the earth's surface in the form of springs or can be extracted via dug or drilled wells; it also contributes significantly to river baseflow. Different water quality issues have to be faced when utilising these different water resources. Some of these are at present largely neglected in water quality regulations. This paper focuses on the inorganic chemical quality of natural groundwater. Possible health effects, the problems of setting meaningful action levels or maximum admissible concentrations (MAC-values) for drinking water, and potential shortcomings in current legislation are discussed. An approach to setting action levels based on transparency, toxicological risk assessment, completeness, and identifiable responsibility is suggested. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is necessary to reveal the composing and distribution characteristics of nutrients for elucidating its complex removal and retention mechanisms in natural wetlands. In this study, the composition and the spatial distribution characteristics of nitrogen in a natural wetland in central China were illustrated and analyzed. The self-organizing map (SOM) model was used in this study to assess the water quality dataset of the wetland. The relationships between nitrogen and other water quality parameters were revealed by the visualization function of the SOM model with the pre-processed data; the modeling result was in agreement with the linear correlation analysis.

Key role of the amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus in reed beds of Lake Ladoga	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The Baikalian amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus, a successful invader in Eurasia, colonized the coastal zone of Lake Ladoga (northeastern Europe) in late 1990s. In the summers of 2000 and 2005 the density and biomass of benthic communities associated with macrophyte beds (Phragmites australis) and role of the invader ill fish diet were studied. Due to high production of macrophytes (600-800 g carbon m(-2) y(-1)) the benthic biomass was high, averaging 70.6 g m(-2) in 2005. Whilst the mean benthic biomass showed a 2-fold increase from 1990 to 2005, the biomass of native benthos 2-fold decreased, from 33.6 +/- 6.6 to 16.5 +/- 6.5 g m(-2). Gmelinoides fasciatus reached 54 +/- 13 g m(-2) and constituted 77% in the zoo-benthic biomass in 2005 as compared with 6% in 1990. Some crustaceans such as Gammarus lacustris and Asellus aquaticus reduced notably their distribution area and decreased in density. G. fasciatus is an important food item in diet of ruffe, perch and young burbot.

Combining Optical and Radar Satellite Imagery to Investigate the Surface Properties and Evolution of the Lordsburg Playa, New Mexico, USA	REMOTE SENSING												Driven by erodible soil, hydrological stresses, land use/land cover (LULC) changes, and meteorological parameters, windblown dust events initiated from Lordsburg Playa, New Mexico, United States, threaten public safety and health through low visibility and exposure to dust emissions. Combining optical and radar satellite imagery products can provide invaluable benefits in characterizing surface properties of desert playas-a potent landform for wind erosion. The optical images provide a long-term data record, while radar images can observe land surface irrespective of clouds, darkness, and precipitation. As a home for optical and radar imagery, powerful algorithms, cloud computing infrastructure, and application programming interface applications, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is an invaluable resource facilitating acquisition, processing, and analysis. In this study, the fractional abundance of soil, vegetation, and water endmembers were determined from pixel mixtures using the linear spectral unmixing model in GEE for Lordsburg Playa. For this approach, Landsat 5 and 8 images at 30 m spatial resolution and Sentinel-2 images at 10-20 m spatial resolution were used. Employing the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques, the playa's land surface changes and possible sinks for sediment loading from the surrounding catchment area were identified. In this data recipe, a pair of Sentinel-1 images bracketing a monsoon day with high rainfall and a pair of images representing spring (dry, windy) and monsoon seasons were used. The combination of optical and radar images significantly improved the effort to identify long-term changes in the playa and locations within the playa susceptible to hydrological stresses and LULC changes. The linear spectral unmixing algorithm addressed the limitation of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images related to their moderate spatial resolutions. The application of GEE facilitated the study by minimizing the time required for acquisition, processing, and analysis of images, and storage required for the big satellite data.					; Tong, Daniel/A-8255-2008	Gill, Thomas E./0000-0001-9011-4105; Tong, Daniel/0000-0002-4255-4568; , Iyasu/0000-0003-2649-5374														2072-4292				SEP	2021	13	17							3402	10.3390/rs13173402	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13173402													WOS:000694606100001

Characterizing the degree of aqueous alteration in a fresh sample of Mukundpura CM chondrite fall using ATR-FTIR and TGA	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements on immediately collected Mukundpura show the typical feature for phyllosilicates around 10 mu m, corresponding to Si-O stretching mode in silicate, and its broadness signifies the amorphous or poorly crystalline silicates. The absence of the 11.2 mu m feature (a characteristic of anhydrous silicate olivine) and the weight loss observed in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) imply aggressive aqueous alteration, which resulted in phyllosilicate formation at the expense of primary anhydrous silicates. It is consistent with Mossbauer spectra, showing the presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+ in phyllosilicates, but no characteristic peak for olivine is observed, suggesting the major fraction of primary silicates are aggressively altered due to the presence of water on the parent body, and now major lithology must be highly altered. TGA measurements were carried on it (i) within 24 h and (ii) after 30 months of its fall. In both cases, the weight loss was similar to 10% in the 400-770 degrees C temperature range, confirming the absence of any environmental impact on the water bound to the hydrated clay in Mukundpura samples. Appreciable weight loss in 400-770 degrees C indicated the presence of hydrated clay that corroborated FTIR measurements and ruled out any thermal event suffered by its postaqueous alteration, consistent with amorphous or poorly crystalline silicate phase observed in FTIR. When we couple the results of the present study and already reported results by our group on the same Mukundpura fragment, it is inferred that our sample has suffered a very high degree of aqueous alteration on the parent body. The fingerprint ratios, which are extensively used to correlate or assign petrological subgroup, are FeO/SiO2, hydrous silicate/anhydrous silicates, and MgO/FeO, which are either considered alone or in combination, and for Mukundpura, the values for these ratios are 1.05, 7.2, and similar to 0.60, respectively. These values indicate that the major lithology of Mukundpura fresh fragment must be assigned as CM2.1.

J	MacCormack, S				MacCormack, Sabine			Human and Divine Love in a Pastoral Setting: The Histories of Copacabana on Lake Titicaca	REPRESENTATIONS												In 1583 an image of the Virgin, the work of an indigenous sculptor, was set up in Copacabana on Lake Titicaca, near an ancient cult site of the Inca Sun. It soon attracted Indian and Creole pilgrims and also became known in Europe. United by their devotion to the Virgin, the pilgrims and others who sought her help did so for diverging reasons. In Creole and European terms the cult of the Virgin of Copacabana is explicable in the context of other cults of Christian miracle-working images. Viewed in its Andean context, however, it highlights deep-rooted continuities with pre-Christian observance and the autonomy and resilience of Indian religious and cultural forms. / REPRESENTATIONS 112.

THE ROLE OF IRON AND MANGANESE REMOBILIZATION TO THE HYPOLIMNIC ENRICHMENT OF HEAVY-METALS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Concentrations of heavy metals in water and in the sediment.sbd.overlying water.sbd.area are given for two different charged urban lakes. During period of summer stratification an increase of heavy metals (Fe,Mn,Cr,Pb,Zn) and Al occurs in the anoxic hypolimnion of the lake, and this seems to be a consequence of redox chemical mobilisation of iron and of coprecipitated heavy metals. In the sediment.sbd.overlying water.sbd.area micro stratifications of dissolved heavy metals occur in the range of the redox decline. The comparison with the less charged lake as well as investigations during period of total circulation and of ice cover confirm this thesis, redox chemical reactions for mobilisation of iron and manganese are of significance for the remobilisation of coprecipitated heavy metals.																			0003-9136					MAR	1986	106	1					91	117																WOS:A1986A649600007

Collapse of Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis (Mitchill, 1818) species pair in Como Lake, Ontario	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) species pairs exist in a small number of northern temperate lakes in North America. Sympatric populations of dwarf and normal-sized whitefish represent a continuum of morphological and genetic divergence among these lakes. In this study, we used morphological and age data to assess the status of the Lake Whitefish species pair in Como Lake, Ontario (Canada). Whitefish were collected with gill-nets from spawning shoals during the fall of 2012 and 2014 and compared with archived (circa 1989) dwarf and normal-sized specimens. Our study indicates that the two previously collected forms have been replaced by a single form with a different morphology and age structure. In comparison to archived specimens, contemporary Lake Whitefish were larger, deeper-bodied and older; with more gill rakers, lateral line scales, smaller eyes and a wider interorbital width. We hypothesize that the recent invasion of Como Lake by Spiny Waterflea (Bythotrephes longimanus) has affected whitefish growth rates and changed the ecosystem conditions that previously maintained the species pair.

This study focused on comparative analyses of the distribution of the green sulfur compared to the purple sulfur bacteria by analyzing specific populations along fine scale depth profiles of the chemocline of Lake Cadagno. Water samples were collected from the chemocline on October 14(th) 1998, and on September 28(th), 2004. A detailed analysis of chemocline depth profiles revealed that total biomass of phototrophic sulfur bacteria was three times higher in 2004 than in 1998. The three-fold increase of biomass was entirely due to increments in abundance of one population of green sulfur bacteria, identified as Chlorobium clathratiforme. Abundance of purple sulfur bacteria remained unchanged with respect to overall numbers in the chemocline, but also with respect to distribution of different populations in depth in the chemocline. Aggregates of small-celled purple sulfur bacteria decreased in size about four-fold, but remained associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria of the genus Desulfocapsa. Compared to 1998, these had increased in numbers about three times in 2004, resulting in about ten times higher numbers per aggregate. These results demonstrate long-term effects of a presumed disturbance in autumn 1999 and 2000, on environmental conditions and on green sulfur and sulfate-reducing bacteria in the chemocline, however, without changes in the abundance and in the distribution of purple sulfur bacteria.

J	Jenkins, KM; Boulton, AJ				Jenkins, KM; Boulton, AJ			Connectivity in a dryland river: Short-term aquatic microinvertebrate recruitment following floodplain inundation	ECOLOGY												Periodic hydrological connectivity among fragmented floodplain habitats governs the persistence of aquatic biota. In dryland rivers, unpredictable flooding interspersed with low flows and drying drive their "boom and bust" ecology. During drying, aquatic habitats contract and fragment. Flooding connects and expands habitats, triggering productivity booms in waterbirds, fish, and plants. Microinvertebrates form the base of the food web and also flourish after floods, but their colonization pathways remain unknown. To determine the relative contribution of flood water-transported propagules vs. emergence of in situ resting stages from inundated sediments, we studied short-term recruitment of microinvertebrates after flooding in the dryland Darling River, Australia. Lakes open to transported and emerging in situ micro invertebrates were compared with lake and laboratory microcosms closed to transported microinvertebrates. Floods imported most early colonists to floodplain lakes. In situ emergence from sediments was less important until weeks later but potentially sustained production over a longer period of inundation. Some taxa primarily colonized lakes via emergence whereas others were only transported to lakes. A spatially nested ANOVA approach spanning patches within lakes to among reaches revealed contrasting variability across hierarchical scales for taxonomic richness and densities of microinvertebrate taxa. This was most marked at the reach scale, possibly reflecting seasonal patterns in flooding. Microinvertebrate colonization sequences in the Darling River floodplain rely on connectivity between habitats during flooding. Ecological connectivity was greater at small spatial scales (patches within lakes 100-1000 m, among lakes 10(4)-10(5) m) than at larger spatial scales (reaches 10(5)-10(6) m). The strength of connectivity is likely to vary across spatial scales with the magnitude, duration, and rate of rise and fall of floods.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	2003	84	10					2708	2723		10.1890/02-0326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0326													WOS:000186599300019

Perch were sampled in six localities in Lake Geneva, and two localities in Lake Neuchatel. Analyses were performed using twelve microsatellites in June 2012 (spawning period) and September 2012 (early autumn). Results revealed that perch populations in Lake Geneva were genetically different than those of Lake Neuchatel. Genetic diversity of perch in Lake Neuchatel (mean number of allele A = 6.91, allelic richness A(r) = 5.19 and observed heterozygosity H-o = 0.607) were significantly higher than for perch in Lake Geneva (A = 6.08 A(r) = 5.86 and H-o = 0.416). Some private alleles were present and characterize each lake population. According to F-ST-pairwise estimates, populations of the two lakes were significantly different. Some hypotheses that may explain this difference are discussed: the nature of the watershed and the anthropic pressures, as fishing pressure and aquaculture practices. Even at a fine-local scale, the choice of the origin of a wild population influences the initial genetic variability introduced in the farming system at the first step of domestication.

J	Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ; Schiff, SL				Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ; Schiff, SL			A S-isotope approach to determine the relative contribution of redox processes to net SO4 export from upland, and wetland-dominated catchments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Reoxidation of S stored in lowlands after summer droughts has been reported to be responsible for the excess SO4 export observed in many catchments in south central Ontario. Stable S isotopes can be used to identify the source of SO4 export in stream water, and are particularly well suited to evaluating zones of dissimilatory SO4 reduction (DSR) and the contribution of oxidation of reduced S species to stream SO4. The Plastic Lake-1 (PC1) stream drains an upland coniferous forest and then passes through a Sphagnum-dominated swamp before discharging to Plastic Lake. Measurements of SO4 fluxes and isotope ratios were used to determine the source of net SO4 export and the contribution of redox processes to S retention and export in the upland and wetland, respectively. Mass balance budgets for the years 1999/00 and 2000/01, which had comparatively wet summers, indicated that the upland part of the catchment consistently exported SO4 in excess of bulk deposition inputs. In contrast, mass budget calculations for the swamp indicated a net retention of 3 and 2 g S-SO4/m(2) of wetland area, in 1999/00 and 2000/01 respectively. Higher 534 SO4 ratios and lower SO4 concentrations in the swamp outflow (average +8.6 +/- 2.6parts per thousand; 1.5 +/- 0.6 mg S-SO4/L) compared to the inflow draining the upland (+5.4 +/- 0.7parts per thousand; 2.4 +/- 0.3 mg S-SO4/L) indicated that DSR was at least partly responsible for net SO4 retention in the swamp. Isotope values in upland stream water (+5.7 +/- 0.7parts per thousand) were only slightly higher than values in bulk deposition (average +5.1 +/- 0.6parts per thousand) and soil leachate (+4.4 +/- 0.4parts per thousand) over the 2-year period of study. Similar sigma(34)SO(4) values in upland stream water compared to deposition and soil leachate, despite substantial variations in water table height in the streambed (92 cm), suggest that reoxidation of reduced sulphides is not an important contributor to SO4 export from the upland. Rather, net SO4 export from the upland subcatchment is likely due to net release from upland soil, and slight differences in sigma(34)SO(4) between bulk deposition and soil leachate are consistent with SO4 release from organic S forms.

Analyses of the LGM wind simulation for the tropical Atlantic show that the convergence zone does not extend all the way into South American continent during the Austral summer. This would have prevented moisture inflow into the adjacent continental area of equatorial northeastern Brazil. Interpretations of paleoclimate proxy records from this region are consistent with this scenario. In the subtropics, LGM westerlies were weaker and data show characteristics of more humid conditions. At higher latitudes model simulations suggest intensification of the westerlies which, in combination with colder sea surface temperatures would imply less moisture influx into the South American continent from the Atlantic sector. Low lake levels in high southern latitudes and general aridity would support the model findings.

Macrophytes are of fundamental importance to the functioning of lake ecosystems. They provide structure, habitat, and a food source and are a required component in monitoring programs of lake ecological quality. The key aim of this study is to document the variation in spatial extent and density of macrophytes seasonally between 2015 and 2020 of the Sirmione Peninsula (Lake Garda, Italy), using Sentinel-2 imagery. In addition to this, our results were compared to previous data from imaging spectrometry; individual parameters affecting macrophyte communities were tested, and the possible effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on macrophyte colonization was evaluated. Satellite images allowed the mapping of the spatiotemporal dynamics of submerged rooted macrophytes in order to support monitoring of the shallow water ecosystem under study. Substantial changes were found in both spatial extent and density over the period from 2015 to 2020, particularly in 2019 when there was almost a complete absence of dense macrophytes. Variables found to influence the amount of macrophytes included transparency, chlorophyll-a, water level, winter wave height, and grazing by herbivores. A separate analysis focusing on areas associated with boat transit found a recovery in macrophyte coverage during the period of COVID-19 lockdown. The outcome of the study highlights a decline in the density of the macrophytes and a shift towards deeper areas compared to the situation in 1997. The area examined is part of an internationally important site containing the highest abundance and diversity of overwintering water birds in Italy. Exploiting satellite data at high frequency provided an insight to understand the dynamic changes and interactions with herbivorous birds, environmental factors, and anthropogenic pressures, revealing a delicately balanced and threatened ecosystem.					; Free, Gary/IUO-8431-2023; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Bolpagni, Rossano/Q-7053-2018; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013	Pinardi, Monica/0000-0001-5289-8842; Ghirardi, Nicola/0000-0002-5006-9853; Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988; Bolpagni, Rossano/0000-0001-9283-2821; 														2076-3417				MAR	2022	12	5							2693	10.3390/app12052693	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12052693													WOS:000769103400001

The objectives of the study were: (i) to identify the depth zone (location in relation to average water level) where the replacement of species occurs most rapidly; (ii) to test whether and to what extent the occurrence of species, their abundance and their response to the gradient evolves over time; and (iii) to assess the shape of the species' response to the gradient, calculating the niche overlap of the dominant species. Results showed that the diversity of species peaked at a depth between 18 and 48 cm, in a zone thought to be of intermediate disturbance (the transect depth was, on average, 103 cm). The main macroalgal species (the red alga, Bangia arropurpurea and the green algae, Jaoa bullata, and Cladophora glomerata), showed a variety of response shapes to the gradient: monotonic, symmetrical and skewed, depending on the stage of seasonal growth. The efficient regulation of growth of B. atropurpurea along the fluctuating gradient was interpreted as an adaptive trait giving it an advantage over more slowly reacting species. The spatial and temporal niches of B. atropurpurea and Jaoa bullata overlapped widely only in early spring, whereas later their optimal habitats were clearly differentiated. This suggested partial niche segregation between these two species, and a potential seasonal interaction. (C) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Grasby, SE				Grasby, SE			Naturally precipitating vaterite (μ-CaCO3) spheres: Unusual carbonates formed in an extreme environment	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Vaterite, a rare hexagonal CaCO3 Polymorph, was identified in precipitates forming at a supraglacial sulfur spring, in Borup Fiord Pass, northern Ellesmere Island, Canadian High Arctic. Vaterite occurs in a precipitate mound along with calcite, gypsum, and native sulfur. The unusual conditions of the site, including an extremely cold climate, supersaturated alkaline waters, and the presence of gypsum, mimics conditions used to grow vaterite in laboratory experiments. Stable isotope data suggest that vaterite may preferentially form during colder periods of the year. Vaterite found at the site is characterized by 2- to 10-mum rounded to spherical shaped particles (comprising smaller 0.5- to 2-mum spheres) as both individuals and in chainlike structures. The spherical habit of vaterite resembles carbonate structures that have been interpreted to be organic; however, delta(13)C values are indicative of an inorganic origin. The thick permafrost, and the extreme cold and dry environment make this site a good terrestrial analog for carbonate precipitates that might be expected at potential deposits associated with water discharge on other planetary bodies.

Unconventional filling dynamics of a pit crater	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The rise and fall of magma columns is a process commonly observed in volcanoes hosting lava lakes and serves as proxy of magmatic reservoir pressure and warning for potential eruptions. This dynamic process typically involves the filling and emptying of a "pit crater" - a cylindrical depression usually formed by one or more collapses of a structure lying above an emptied surficial reservoir. Between 2016 and 2020, the 300 m deep pit crater located within Nyamulagira volcano (Democratic Republic of Congo) underwent an unusual filling dynamic. In May 2019 while filled to about 90% the crater floor collapsed by 90 m within two months, followed by the rapid emergence of a sub-circular solidified block overlooking the crater rim in less than 6 months. Using numerical simulations of models based on thermal energy and constrained by multiparametric data, we account for the incremental filling of the crater by successive intra-crateric lava flows and the subsequent collapse of the crater floor. We further characterize this unconventional filling mode based on thermal budget considerations. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Regional, Seasonal, and Diurnal Variations of Cloud-to-Ground Lightning with Large Impulse Charge Moment Changes	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The use of both total charge moment change (CMC) and impulse charge moment change (iCMC) magnitudes to assess the potential of a cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning stroke to induce a mesospheric sprite has been well described in the literature, particularly on a case study basis. In this climatological study, large iCMC discharges for thresholds of >100 and >300 C km in both positive and negative polarities are analyzed on a seasonal basis. Also presented are local solar time diurnal distributions in eight different regions covering the lower 48 states as well as the adjacent Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf Stream. The seasonal maps show the predisposition of large positive iCMCs to dominate across the northern Great Plains, with large negative iCMCs favored in the southeastern United States year-round. During summer, the highest frequency of large positive iCMCs across the upper Midwest aligns closely with the preferred tracks of nocturnal mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). As iCMC values increase above 300 C km, the maximum shifts eastward of the 100 C km maximum in the central plains. Diurnal distributions in the eight regions support these conclusions, with a nocturnal peak in large iCMC discharges in the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes, an early to midafternoon peak in the Intermountain West and the southeastern United States, and a morning peak in large iCMC discharge activity over the Atlantic Ocean. Large negative iCMCs peak earlier in time than large positive iCMCs, which may be attributed to the growth of large stratiform charge reservoirs following initial convective development.					; Cummer, Steven/A-6118-2008	Lyons, Walter/0000-0001-6009-2259; Lang, Timothy/0000-0003-1576-572X													0027-0644	1520-0493				OCT	2014	142	10					3666	3682		10.1175/MWR-D-14-00034.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-14-00034.1													WOS:000342482400009

The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in surface waters of the main basin of Lake Kivu showed modest spatial (coefficient of variation between 3% and 6%), and seasonal variations with an amplitude of 163 ppm (between 579 +/- 23 ppm on average in March 2007 and 742 +/- 28 ppm on average in September 2007). The most prominent spatial feature of the pCO(2) distribution was the very high pCO(2) values in Kabuno Bay (a small sub-basin with little connection to the main lake) ranging between 11213 ppm and 14213 ppm (between 18 and 26 times higher than in the main basin). Surface waters of the main basin of Lake Kivu were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere at an average rate of 10.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1), which is lower than the global average reported for freshwater, saline, and volcanic lakes. In Kabuno Bay, the cbCO(2) emission to the atmosphere was on average 500.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (similar to 46 times higher than in the main basin). Based on whole-lake mass balance of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) bulk concentrations and of its stable carbon isotope composition, we show that the epilimnion of Lake Kivu was net autotrophic. This is due to the modest river inputs of organic carbon owing to the small ratio of catchment area to lake surface area (2.15). The carbon budget implies that the CO2 emission to the atmosphere must be sustained by DIC inputs of geogenic origin from deep geothermal springs.

J	Zakaria, HY; Ahmed, MH; Flower, R				Zakaria, Howaida Yehia; Ahmed, Mahmoud Hussien; Flower, Roger			Environmental assessment of spatial distribution of zooplankton community in Lake Manzalah, Egypt	ACTA ADRIATICA												Lake Manzalah is the largest of the four Nile Delta lakes in Egypt. It provides more than 50% of the total inland fisheries of the country. During the last two decades the Lake has been exposed to multiple changes mainly due to local human activities. Monthly zooplankton samples were collected during an integrated environmental monitoring program within the MELMARINA Project that extended from July 2003 to September 2004 to study the distribution and occurrence of zooplankton community in Lake Manzalah. Results showed that, the average zooplankton standing crop was 1277 x 103 individuals m(-3). Spring was the most productive season (2127 x 10(3) individuals m(-3)) representing 41.65% to the total zooplankton counts. Five groups dominated zooplankton community; Rotifera, Copepoda, Ostracoda, Protozoa and Cladocera. The meroplanktonic larvae of Polychaeta, Cirripedia, Mysidacea and Gastropoda as well as free living nematods were rarely recorded. Rotiftra contributed 81.89% to the total zooplankton community. They were represented by 38 species belonging to 19 genera dominated by genus Brachionus (86.65% of the total Rotifera) followed by genus Keratella (8.68%). Keratella species has been indicated as on indicator of pollution. Copepoda (including their larval stages) was the second group in order of abundance forming about 14.28% of the total zooplankton counts and represented by seven species. Acanthocyclops americanus was the dominant species. The productivity of Lake Manzalah decreased from 19 79 to become highly eutrophic lake during the present study, but with higher production than the other Egyptian lakes. Management is needed to stabilize the Manzalah lake ecosystem in a way that promotes the sustainability of the system.																			0001-5113						2007	48	2					161	172																WOS:000252564400007
J	STAHL, JB				STAHL, JB			ECOLOGY OF CHAOBORUS IN MYERS LAKE INDIANA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Two species of Chaoborus live in Myers Lake, Indiana, C. punctipennis (Say) and C. flavicans (Meigen). Their distributions and life cycles were studied to see if their ecological niches were sufficiently different to explain their coexistence. C. flavicans emerged earlier than most of the C. punctipennis in Myers Lake, but in two Ontario lakes they emerged at the same time, so differences in emergence time are not thought to be significant. Bathymetric distribution, time of nocturnal vertical migration, and the length at which the larvae become benthic were similar in both species. Although mature larvae of C. flavicans were larger than those of C. punctipennis, young larvae of the same size lived together during the summer. Presumably larvae of the same size use the same food. Therefore, it is concluded that the niches of C. punctipennis and C. flavicans are similar; any differences are probably too small to explain their coexistence.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1966	11	2					177	+		10.4319/lo.1966.11.2.0177	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1966.11.2.0177													WOS:A19667752500004

Warming combined with experimental eutrophication intensifies lake phytoplankton blooms	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton blooms are a global water quality issue, and successful management depends on understanding their responses to multiple and interacting drivers, including nutrient loading and climate change. Here, we examine a long-term dataset from Lake 227, a site subject to a fertilization experiment (1969-present) with changing nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios. We applied a process-oriented model, MyLake, and updated the model structure with nutrient uptake kinetics that incorporated shifting N:P and competition among phytoplankton functional groups. We also tested different temperature and P-loading scenarios to examine the interacting effects of climate change and nutrient loading on phytoplankton blooms. The model successfully reproduced lake physics over 48 yr and the timing, overall magnitude, and shifting community structure (diazotrophs vs. non-diazotrophs) of phytoplankton blooms. Intra- and interannual variability was captured more accurately for the P-only fertilization period than for the high N:P and low N:P fertilization periods, highlighting the difficulty of modeling complex blooms even in well-studied systems. A model scenario was also run which removed climate-driven temperature trends, allowing us to disentangle concurrent drivers of blooms. Results showed that increases in water temperature in the spring led to earlier and larger phytoplankton blooms under climate change than under the effects of nutrient fertilization alone. These findings suggest that successful lake management efforts should incorporate the effects of climate change in addition to nutrient reductions, including intensifying and/or expanding monitoring periods and incorporating climate change into uncertainty estimates around future conditions.					; Higgins, Scott/F-5700-2016; Paterson, Michael/AGT-8809-2022; Couture, Raoul/AGR-6683-2022	Venkiteswaran, Jason J./0000-0002-6574-7071; Couture, Raoul/0000-0003-4940-3372; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2022	67	1					147	158		10.1002/lno.11982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11982		NOV 2021											WOS:000721810700001

Catastrophic events in the Quaternary outflow history of Lake Baikal	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake Baikal is Earth's deepest lake and an iconic site of scientific study. This vast basin holds sedimentary archives of environmental change dating back to the Miocene and its array of palaeoshorelines and surrounding relief record the past similar to 1-3 Ma of lake-levels and outflows. Here we present an extensive review of previous work alongside a new set of observations concerning the Quaternary development of Lake Baikal, with special focus on lake-level fluctuations and the formation and evolution of the lake's three known outlets. The sequence of shoreline terraces indicates that lake-levels were both higher and lower in the past. Lake Baikal stood similar to 200 m higher during the Last Interglacial, i.e. Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e and dropped to 40 m below (present-day) during the Last Glacial Maximum (MIS 2). The relative lake-level variations reflect climate factors and gradual or sudden (coseismic) tectonic impacts on the elevation of the lake's outlet thresholds. Three successive outlets are known: i) the palaeo-Goloustnaya-Manzurka, associated with the Manzurka Alluvium; ii) the palaeo-Irkut, and iii) the currently-active Angara River outlet. We propose that the Manzurka Alluvium is the product of catastrophic events in Lake Baikal. The sudden (possibly coseismic) collapse of the similar to 15 x 3 km Goloustnaya fault block into Lake Baikal triggered a mega-tsunami that thrust overwash deposits across neighbouring drainage divides above Lake Baikal and the valleys of the Goloustnaya-Manzurka River system. The age of the Manzurka Alluvium remains poorly constrained, but the mega-tsunami is potentially traceable to an unconformity in drill core sediments at similar to 0.8-1.0 Ma, although older (late Pliocene) and younger (similar to 125 ka) ages have also been proposed. The Irkut outlet existed between MIS 6 and MIS 5 when lake-level was similar to 200 m higher than present (similar to 640-650 masl) and a large bay extended into the Tunka rift at Baikal's south-west tip. Lake Baikal retreated from the Tunka rift when lake-level fell by up to 100 m in early MIS Se. We propose that the lake-level fall is connected to a partial collapse of Primorsky Ridge at Listvenichny Bay, which caused Baikal to overspill into the Angara River thereby forming a new outlet. The release of a > 4000 km(3) megaflood down the Angara River valley caused large-scale modification and reworking of valley-fills (MIS 5e). At the end of MIS 2, further collapse of Primorsky Ridge lowered the outlet threshold an additional 50-60 m and prompted a second megaflood down the Angara River valley, which left a widespread unconformity where horizontal-bedded sands (dated at similar to 11.8-13.4 ka) overlie cryoturbated deposits of the earlier megaflood. The central role of catastrophic processes at Lake Baikal suggests that, rather than being rare events, coseismic landsliding and mega-tsunami may be more frequent than hitherto recognised.

Large increase in CH4 emission following conversion of coastal marsh to aquaculture ponds caused by changing gas transport pathways	WATER RESEARCH												Methane emissions from aquatic ecosystems play an important role in global carbon cycle and climate change. Reclamation of coastal wetlands for aquaculture use has been shown to have opposite effects on sediment CH4 production potential and CH4 emission flux, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we compared sediment properties, CH4 production potential, emission flux, and CH4 transport pathways between a brackish marsh and the nearby reclaimed aquaculture ponds in the Min River Estuary in southeastern China. Despite that the sediment CH4 production potential in the ponds was significantly lower than the marsh, CH4 emission flux in the ponds (17.4 +/- 2.7 mg m(-2) h(-1)) was 11.9 times higher than the marsh (1.3 +/- 0.2 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Plant-mediated transport accounted for 75% of the total CH4 emission in the marsh, whereas ebullition accounted for 95% of the total CH4 emission in the ponds. CH4 emission fluxes in both habitat types were highest in the summer. These results suggest that the increase in CH4 emission following the conversion of brackish marsh to aquaculture ponds was not caused by increased sediment CH4 production, but rather by eliminating rhizospheric oxidation and shifting the major transport pathway to ebullition, allowing sediment CH4 to bypass oxidative loss. This study improves our understanding of the impacts of modification of coastal wetlands on greenhouse gas dynamics.

Weakly expressed climate oscillations have been inferred from some local pollen records of Late Saalian sediments. Sea level stood 7 m below the current northwest German sea-level datum (NN) during the interglacial climate optimum and decreased afterward. A uniform vegetational succession of the Eemian mixed forests, correlated with marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e, terminated with the demise of boreal woodlands marked by a steep increase in nonarboreal pollen. This is the onset of the early Weichselian Herning Stade, correlated with MIS 5d. No sharp climate oscillations during the Eemian have been documented. In the ending phase of the interglaciation, the climate deteriorated gradually. Dominant heath and grass tundras point to a substantial decline of summer temperature during the Herning Stade. Sea level then stood at -40 m NN. Sedimentological considerations, supported by counts of partly varved deposits, indicate that the Eemian lasted about 10,000-11,000 yr and the Herning for several millennia.

Ten AMS radiocarbon dates on bulk sediment samples show that the lake came into existence about 2,300 years ago and that it has dried out since then, but only for brief time periods. Changes in the diatom assemblage composition indicate that lake level fluctuated in response to shifting humidity conditions. The changes reflect wetter conditions ca. 300 BC-AD 800, more variable conditions between AD 800 and 1150, a distinct dry phase within the time span AD 1150-1700 and a return thereafter to more humid conditions until present. There is general agreement between the Lake Nhauhache record and other records from the Southern Hemisphere summer rainfall region. This suggests that sediments from small interdunal lakes, which are abundant along the coast of southern Africa, provide reliable, regional paleoenvironmental information about an area from which more such data are needed.

J	Dye, B; Jose, F; Allahdadi, MN				Dye, Bass; Jose, Felix; Allahdadi, Mohammad Nabi			Circulation Dynamics and Seasonal Variability for the Charlotte Harbor Estuary, Southwest Florida Coast	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A hydrodynamic model was developed and validated for the Charlotte Harbor estuarine system, located in SW Florida, to elucidate freshwater fluxes within the system's various inlets during diverse hydrologic conditions. Fresh water entering the system not only varies seasonally but also, because of regulatory fresh water, releases controlling water levels within an upstream lake. The unnatural freshwater releases have been found to negatively affect the system's ecology, in particular within the Caloosahatchee River portion of the system. Neither the flood nor ebb phase exhibits uniform dominance in flushing the system's four major passes. Boca Grande Pass and Big Carlos Pass were mostly ebb dominant, whereas San Carlos Bay was largely flood dominant; neither phase dominated at Captiva Pass. The similarities and/or contradictions of these results in comparison to former field and modeling results are mainly attributed to the differences between the freshwater sources and environmental forces corresponding to each study that forces a different mass-balance condition over the estuary-bay system and, thereby, at each individual inlet. A Lagrangian particle tracking study revealed particles released within the Peace River during different hydrological conditions were comparably transported regardless of freshwater inputs and predominate wind direction. In contrast, particles released within the Caloosahatchee River were flushed into the Gulf of Mexico within 10 days during a usually wet El Nino, dry(November-April) season period whereas during the summer wet (May-October) season released particles remained in the estuary for a longer period (13 days), ultimately resulting in their further transport into Pine Island Sound and Matlacha Pass. The results also demonstrate the effect of freshwater river inputs and wind on the travel time of the neutrally buoyant particles within the estuarine system. The hydrodynamic and coupled particle tracking model serve as the first step in a forthcoming larval transport modeling study.					; Dye, Bass/LKM-3112-2024; Jose, Felix/A-1770-2015; Allahdadi, Mohammad/AAB-4214-2022	Dye, Bass/0000-0001-9745-353X; Jose, Felix/0000-0002-9892-0950; 													0749-0208	1551-5036				MAR	2020	36	2					276	288		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-19-00071.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-19-00071.1													WOS:000516577400007

Middle Eocene regressive phase evident in the uppermost part of the Harudi Formation, Kachchh Basin, western India	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The present study focuses on the presence of gypsiferous foraminiferal packstone (GFP) facies which defines the top of the Lutetian aged Harudi Formation and separates it from the overlying Bartonian aged Fulra Limestone Formation. This facies has been reported from Harudi and Lakhpat areas of Kachchh District and may serve as a regressive stratigraphic boundary between the Harudi and Fulra Limestone Formations that had been previously considered as conformable succession. Here, the gypsum, halite and iron oxide minerals (hematite and/or goethite) are precipitated as secondary minerals in the desiccation cracks developed in the foraminiferal packstone facies. The precipitation of gypsum, halite and hematite/goethite along with desiccation cracks is suggestive of the oxidizing condition and would have been possible in supratidal environment under warm and dry semi-arid to arid climatic conditions. Thus, it is inferred that the cracks would have been formed during subaerial exposure of the foraminiferal packstone facies during relative sea-level fall.																			0891-2556	1878-5212				FEB 3	2020	35	1							17	10.1007/s13146-020-00549-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-020-00549-w													WOS:000512836100001

During the earlier phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions, lahars were generated by expulsion of waters from the Lake, but once the lake had emptied, lahars were formed by remobilisation of seasonal snowpack laden with saturated freshly erupted tephra. Four types of lahars occurred during the eruptive sequence: (1) Initial snow-slurry lahars, composed of granular snow and ice incorporated by eruptively expelled Crater Lake waters which left behind frozen deposits with 2.5-20% elastic sediment. (2) Large dilute lahars, generated as the volumes of ejected lake water increased and removed much of the readily available snow. At least one third of the pre-eruption Crater Lake volume was expelled during one day producing the largest lahars of the series. These lahars were hyperconcentrated flows for up to 84 km from source, leaving extensive deposits along the channel margins. (3) Concentrated lahars; smaller volume lahars generated as the frequency of eruptions and volumes of expelled water declined. These lahars were able to maintain high sediment concentrations, measured at 46-52% by volume suspended sediment at 42 km from source. Their high sediment concentrations were maintained by erosion and incorporation of sand from the deposits of earlier flows which were lining the channel margins. (4) Remobilised tephra lahars, generated following the two largest tephra eruptions of the sequence. Seasonal snowpack was covered by water-saturated tephra. Warmer spring temperatures and heavy rainfall events caused collapse and remobilisation of snow and tephra, producing several lahars in catchments draining eastern Ruapehu.					; Neall, Vincent/NFT-6307-2025; Cronin, Shane/AAC-9964-2020	Cronin, Shane/0000-0001-7499-603X; 													0377-0273					MAR	1997	76	1-2					47	61		10.1016/S0377-0273(96)00064-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0377-0273(96)00064-9													WOS:A1997WP40200003

Exploring the extensive movements and home range of one of North America's most mobile fish: the freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens are a unique and ubiquitous freshwater species of the family Sciaenidae. Despite the species' wide distribution and unique biogeography, life history, and behavior, surprisingly little is known about freshwater drum movement ecology. In this study, we use passive acoustic telemetry tags and a broad-scale gridded receiver array to track the interannual and seasonal movement of freshwater drum tagged in tributaries of the North and South Basins of Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada). First, tagged freshwater drum had lower survival in the south basin where higher fishing pressure is thought to be a cause of mortality. We found that freshwater drum in Lake Winnipeg are remarkably mobile, with mean monthly movement rates among the highest on record for any freshwater fish. In the spring, fish entered rivers prior to spawning. A few weeks later, most individuals moved into lake habitat where they made extensive lateral movements. Home range and hotspot analysis revealed seasonal and population-specific patterns of occupancy, with elevated densities in lake habitat during the ice-on period and dispersed distributions during open water. Both populations remained almost exclusively in their respective rivers and basins. Homing and site fidelity were apparent, with nearly all fish returning to their original tagging river during each successive spawning season. The results bolster the existing information on freshwater drum movement ecology and may help enhance conservation and management strategies, particularly toward addressing commercial bycatch.					; Enders, Eva/G-9804-2019; Enders, Eva/HLG-6347-2023	Glowa, Sarah/0000-0002-0711-6642; Enders, Eva/0000-0003-2103-0359; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2024	107	12			SI		1709	1731		10.1007/s10641-024-01635-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-024-01635-x		NOV 2024											WOS:001360217100001

However, integrating participant feedback into current science, research, and decision-making processes is challenging. This paper presents a novel approach that marries a rigorous Delphi method, borrowed from policy and organizational sciences, with contemporary "crowdsourcing" to address the complex problems of water pollution exacerbated by climate change in the Lake Champlain Basin. In an online Delphi forum that occurred over a six-week period during the Spring of 2014, fifty-three participants proposed and commented on adaptive solutions to address water quality in the context of climate change. In a follow up Multi-Stakeholder workshop, thirty-eight stakeholders participated in refining and synthesizing the results from the forum. To inform modeling and policy dialogue, the resulting list of interventions was analyzed by time horizon, domain, type of adaptation action, and priority level. The interventions suggested by stakeholders within the crowdsourcing forum have contributed to the current policy dialogue in Vermont including legislation to address phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain. This stakeholder approach strengthens traditional modeling scenario development to include solutions and priorities that have been collectively refined and vetted.						zia, asim/0000-0001-8372-6090													0959-3780	1872-9495				JUL	2017	45						111	123		10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.05.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.05.005													WOS:000411912800010
J	Suárez, SP; Peiffer, S; Gebauer, G				Suarez, Silvia Parra; Peiffer, Stefan; Gebauer, Gerhard			Origin and fate of nitrate runoff in an agricultural catchment: Haean, South Korea - Comparison of two extremely different monsoon seasons	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The monsoon season in South Korea has great influences on biogeochemical and hydrological processes in the entire country, but is specifically of concern in the Soyang lake watershed, the main drinking water reservoir for the 20-million-people metropolis Seoul. Therefore, water quality and nitrate concentration control in Lake Soyang is of high public priority. The Haean catchment is the most prominent agriculture-dominated sub-catchment of the Soyang lake watershed. It is a complex terrain influenced by extreme rain events and non-point nitrate sources. In this investigation we used input-output calculations and a stable isotope approach to quantify and determinate the origin of nitrate inputs into the rivers that later flow into the lake. During pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons in 2013 and 2014 we measured daily rainfall and river water discharge within the Haean catchment and collected rain, river water and groundwater samples in order to analyze nitrate concentrations and nitrate nitrogen and oxygen isotope abundances. Furthermore, we collected nitrogen fertilizers as applied in the catchment. Heavy monsoon events, as in 2013, were the most pronounced drivers of nitrate leaching being responsible for >80% of the nitrate output in the river runoff. On the other hand, an almost missing summer monsoon in 2014 drove the nitrate runoff in a different manner, being responsible for only 0.4% of the total nitrate nitrogen river discharge in the previous year. Results of nitrate nitrogen and oxygen isotope abundance analyses suggest soil microbial nitrification as the most important contributor to the nitrate in the river runoff. In addition, nitrate from groundwater partially affected by microbial denitrilication contributed to the nitrate in the runoff due to river-aquifer exchange fluxes during the monsoon season. Direct leaching of nitrate from mineral fertilizers and atmospheric nitrate deposition were obviously only minor contributors to the nitrate in the runoff. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kankaala, P; Bergström, I				Kankaala, P; Bergström, I			Emission and oxidation of methane in Equisetum fluviatile stands growing on organic sediment and sand bottoms	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Methane emission and rhizospheric CH4 oxidation were studied in stands of Equisetum fluviatile, a common cryptogam in boreal lakes. The experiment was performed in mesocosms with organic sediment or sand bottoms under natural variation of temperature and light using the light-oxic dark-anoxic chamber (LO/DA) technique. Net CH4 emission from the organic sediment during the growing season varied between 3.4 and 19.0 mg m(-2) h(-1), but from sand the net CH4 emission was only 3-10% of that measured from the organic sediment. In the organic sediment net CH4 emission was very significantly correlated with sediment temperature (r(2) = 0.92). In the sand mesocosms the variation of net CH4 emission was better correlated with the shoot biomass than with sediment temperature variation during the growing season, indicating that methanogens were severely limited by substrate availability and were probably dependent on substrates produced by E. fluviatile. The proportion of the methane oxidized of the potential CH4 emission in summer did not differ significantly between the bottom types. The net CH4 emission during the growing season as a proportion of the seasonal maximum of the shoot biomass was significantly higher in the organic sediment mesocosms (6.5%) than in sand (1.7%). The high CH4 emissions observed from dense well-established E. fluviatile stands in the field appear to be more related to temperature-regulated turnover of detritus in the anaerobic sediment and less to CH4 oxidation and seasonal variation in plant growth dynamics.																			0168-2563					JAN	2004	67	1					21	37		10.1023/B:BIOG.0000015277.17288.7a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:BIOG.0000015277.17288.7a													WOS:000188852600002

Evaluating the hydrological, geothermal and anthropic factors in the Banos tarn (Spanish Pyrenees)	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Banos tarn is a low-altitude Pyrenean glacial lake with both geothermal and surface influxes and significant local anthropic stressors. Its water was seasonally sampled from 2010 to 2013 to study its dynamics and evaluate the main factors affecting its hydrochemical trends. Main surface and thermal streams draining into the water mass were also assessed and a detailed characterisation of the study site was made. The large catchment area of the Banos tarn implies a huge water input, a short water retention time and a high water mass mixing that reduces the natural stratification of the lake. The hydrochemical features of the Banos tarn are primarily determined by a slightly alkaline pH and fluctuating medium-high ionic and nutrient contents. Hydrological changes affecting lake tributaries are the foremost factors driving seasonal changes in the ionic composition of the lake. Resuspension of organic matter and nutrients trapped in floor sediments by a century-long history of untreated waste water inputs is supposed to be the main nutrient source to the Banos water mass. Other anthropic activities, such as tourism, dam and withdrawal pipe management, as well as shoreline reforestation, also affect the trophic dynamics of the Banos tarn. These results present herein are scientifically novel because of the uncommon features of the Banos tarn and may broaden our understanding of factors affecting glacial lake dynamics on a global scale.

Studying past effects can throw light on future predictions of solar terrestrial relations at similar solar activity levels. Solar induced climate changes do happen at the turning points of such cycles when changes in solar spin rates occur. Reversing of North Atlantic Oscillations can be interpreted in terms of solar stimuli. The sudden abrupt rises of lakes levels and closed seas are solar forced. It is anticipated that the Aral and the Dead Sea will recover in the near future. Following drought conditions in African Equatorial lakes by the end of cycle 23 around 2008 +/- 2 yr, cyclic rises and falls of lakes level are expected to be coherent with the weak cycles 24 to perhaps 26 when solar forcings will reverse or cease to exist. The Atlanto Canadian fish disappearance dilemma is a natural Wolf-Gleissberg cycle induced effect and is expected to recover in due time. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Data on the weather, structure of lake ice, and geochemistry of water were also collected during the 60-day field program. The study lake is shallow (mean depth 1.0-1.5 m) with a large wetland area. Compared with polar lakes, solar elevation is higher, snow accumulation is much lower, and the ice has more sediment. The ice was all congelation ice with a mean thickness of 36.6 cm, corresponding to a mean air temperature of -9.6 degrees C. The mean daily broadband albedo and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) band transmittance were 0.54 and 0.08 (bare ice), 0.74 and 0.04 (new snow), and 0.30 and 0.12 (melting period), respectively. The level of light allowed photosynthesis to occur to the bottom of the lake. The ice acted as a grey filter for the sunlight with a mean attenuation coefficient of 2.1 m(-1). These results expand our knowledge of the evolution of light transfer through ice and snow cover and its role in the ecology of lakes in temperate and arid areas.

The aim of this study was to map and quantify groundwater discharge to Lake Steilingen, a small lake in south-west Germany, using Rn as a natural groundwater tracer. 222Rn, nutrients, temperature and oxygen concentration were measured in depth profiles and in sediment-near water samples during April and June 2016. The spatial distribution of Rn activities (max. 944Bqm-3) showed that groundwater discharges into the middle of the lake and along the northeastern shore from springs in the hypolimnion (11-14m depth). Based on a Rn mass-balance groundwater accounts for 70% of the total water input (GWflux= 11ls-1) to the lake. There were significant positive correlations between methane and nitrite with Rn activity, suggesting the groundwater as a common source. Overall the inflow of groundwater causes a deterioration in lake water quality.

We examined the individual and combined effects of climate warming and microplastic pollution on the growth rate and predatory performance of an invasive freshwater fish, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). In temperature-controlled chambers, we exposed 160 juvenile gobies to one of six scenarios over 37 d, combining three environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics (63-75 & mu;m polyethylene microbeads) with two temperature regimes representing contemporary (18 & DEG;C) and projected mean summer maxima (26 & DEG;C) in their current range in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin. Exposure to elevated temperature reduced the growth and predatory performance of round gobies. Their decline in predatory performance was greatest at the highest microplastic concentration, regardless of temperature. The effects of environmentally relevant microplastic concentrations on the growth and performance of gobies were weaker than the effects of thermal stress. Given that the round goby is an abundant and widely distributed bottom-dwelling fish in nearshore areas of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin, its responses to these co-occurring stressors could have cascading effects on food webs.

In addition, the seasonal dynamics of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton were followed in the lake from April to November. Bacterioplankton production was P limited from May to August. N alone never stimulated bacterioplankton production, but bacterioplankton growth was close to colimited by P and N in July and August. Organic C stimulated bacterial production in June and September. Zooplankton enhanced bacterioplankton production in June, when bacterioplankton production was limited by P and C and the phytoplankton biomass in the lake was low. N alone stimulated phytoplankton growth in all experiments. In addition, P alone stimulated phytoplankton growth in May and July and the combination of P and N stimulated phytoplankton growth in July and August. Zooplankton additions resulted in a decrease in phytoplankton biomass in May and September, mainly owing to grazing on Cryptophyceae. The experimental results indicate that bacterioplankton and phytoplankton growth were uncoupled during most of the open-water period because P primarily limited bacterioplankton growth and N limited phytoplankton growth. The response of the bacterioplankton community was most likely a direct effect of nutrient additions. Primary production and bacterioplankton production were correlated during the season, but partial correlations analysis indicates that this relationship can be attributed to the fact that both primary production and bacterioplankton production showed strong positive correlations with temperature. We suggest that uncoupling of bacterioplankton production and phytoplankton production may be a common phenomenon in lakes.

In July the geese gathered in the central Seewinkel area (main gathering place Lange Lacke). After summer migration resightings of ringed geese dated from September onwards. The large flocks of non-breeders preferred the Lange Lacke area. Observations of non-breeders indicated that they left the area almost completely during moult and they were then resighted in July. Before the moult, non-breeding geese showed small-scale movements indicating fidelity to favoured localities. Some of them were the former rearing sites. The association of birds ringed on the same site and in the same year in the first and even the second year after ringing was shown.																			0373-2266						1991	79	2					265	268																WOS:A1991FM37700030

The isolate, designated strain Y5 is a spore-forming, motile rod, with lateral flagella. It is Gram-negative though it phylogenetically falls within the low G + C Gram-positive organisms. In addition to the more usual electron donors such as lactate and succinate, strain Y5 also can use H-2 + CO2 chemoautotrophically and metabolize aromatic compounds such as syringic acid, ferulic acid, phenol, benzoate and toluene, coupled to arsenate reduction. Aside from As(V), nitrate, sulfate, thiosulfate and Fe(III) can also serve as electron acceptors. Based on 16S rDNA phylogeny and its physiological characteristics, strain Y5 was identified as most closely related to the genus Desulfosporosinus. The ability of microorganisms to reduce arsenate for respiration appears to be widely distributed and may be relevant in the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in environments containing mixed contaminants.

J	Dokulil, MT; Teubner, K				Dokulil, MT; Teubner, K			Steady state phytoplankton assemblages during thermal stratification in deep alpine lakes. Do they occur?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Phytoplankton seasonal and long-term succession can be described and functionally classified by associations similar as in terrestrial vegetation studies. Such a concept has to include 'climax' into pelagic succession which in turn leads to the question to what extent steady state assemblages occur and if during periods of dynamic equilibrium can be identified. Here we explore the situation with respect to the above question for deep, nutrient poor, alpine lakes in Austria. We first track the long-term development of phytoplankton biomass, their taxonomic structure and their relation to total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a as predictors of trophic state over the past 35 years. We then analyse this data set for coherent algal associations which can be ascribed to trait separated functional groups according to Reynolds et al. (2002). A three year period of stable environmental conditions has then be extracted from the progression of trophic state indices, having similar dominating species each year. These years were finally analysed for steady state conditions according to definitions given in Sommer et al. (1993). During thermal stratification, achievement of an equilibrium could be ruled out although coexistence of several dominating species lasted for several weeks. Habitat templates were constructed from environmental variables prior to biomass peaks for two species important in summer assemblages, the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella and the diatom Fragilaria crotonensis. In summary, functional groups proved to be a valid and useful concept to describe species succession of phytoplankton in deep alpine lakes while pelagic climax is much less clear and steady state conditions were never met.					; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 													0018-8158					JUL	2003	502	1-3					65	72		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004270.70364.f3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004270.70364.f3													WOS:000186636900005

The Sentinel-3A satellite is equipped with a dual-frequency synthetic aperture radar altimeter (SRAL), which allows for inland water levels to be measured with higher precision and improved spatial resolution. However, in regions at middle and high latitudes, where many lakes are covered by ice during the winter, the non-uniformity of the altimeter footprint can substantially impact the accuracy of water level estimates, resulting in abnormal readings when applying standard SRAL synthetic aperture radar (SAR) waveform retracking algorithms (retrackers). In this study, a modified method is proposed to determine the current surface type of lakes, analyzing changes in backscattering coefficients and brightness temperature. This method aligns with ground station observations and ensures consistent surface type classification. Additionally, a dual-threshold algorithm that addresses the limitations of the original bimodal algorithm by identifying multiple peaks without needing elevation correction is introduced. This innovative approach significantly enhances the precision of equivalent water level measurements for ice-covered lakes. The study retrieves and compares the water level data of nine North American lakes covered by ice from 2016-2019 using the dual-threshold and the SAMOSA-3 algorithm with in situ data. For Lake Athabasca, Cedar Lake, Great Slave Lake, Lake Winnipeg, and Lake Erie, the root mean square error (RMSE) of SAMOSA-3 is 39.58 cm, 46.18 cm, 45.75 cm, 42.64 cm, and 6.89 cm, respectively. However, the dual-threshold algorithm achieves an RMSE of 6.75 cm, 9.47 cm, 5.90 cm, 7.67 cm, and 5.01 cm, respectively, representing a decrease of 75%, 79%, 87%, 82%, and 27%, respectively, compared to SAMOSA-3. The dual-threshold algorithm can accurately estimate water levels in ice-covered lakes during winter. It offers a promising prospect for achieving long-term, continuous, and high-precision water level measurements for middle- and high-latitude lakes.					an, zhiyuan/GWN-2548-2022; Qiu, Liang/AEQ-0223-2022															1424-8220				DEC	2023	23	24							9724	10.3390/s23249724	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23249724								38139570					WOS:001136032800001

Trona deposition in the basin can be explained in terms of its geology, hydrology and geochemistry. Brine composition and evolution takes the form of dilute stream and dilute underground flows, hots saline spring reservoir and saturated brines. Trona is precipitated in the lake as a result of evaporative concentration of saline alkaline brines. Carbonates, halides, sodium silicates, zeolites, feldspars, iron oxides, quartz and garnet, occur in trona as impurities. The presence of authigenic minerals is attributed to the reaction between the volcanics and brines. Other minerals forming from residual brines are halite, gaylussite, calcite, villiaumite, strontianite, fluorite and mirabilite.																					90-5809-163-5				2000							383	386																WOS:000089525700099
J	DELGIORGIO, PA; PETERS, RH				DELGIORGIO, PA; PETERS, RH			PATTERNS IN PLANKTONIC P-R RATIOS IN LAKES - INFLUENCE OF LAKE TROPHY AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A comparative analysis of planktonic metabolism in 20 southern Quebec lakes was carried out to test the hypothesis that planktonic P:R ratios reflect gradients of both nutrient enrichment and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Mean epilimnetic phytoplankton photosynthesis ranged from 8 to 377 mg C m-3 d-1, and the amount of C respired by the plankton in excess of phytoplankton photosynthesis ranged from 30 to 86 mg C m-3 d-1. Plankton community respiration was 2-8 times greater than phytoplankton photosynthesis in all oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes during the growing season, and this imbalance narrowed toward the more productive lakes. P:R ratios were positively related to chlorophyll and total P concentration, and inversely related to water color and DOC concentration. The strong influence of DOC on planktonic P:R ratios was almost exclusively due to its depressing effect on phytoplankton photosynthesis; DOC had no statistical effect on respiration. The calculated DOC loading for these lakes suggests that organic C loss through epilimnetic respiration in excess of phytoplankton photosynthesis is comparable to the estimated DOC loss within the lakes and that summer plankton metabolism could be supported by external DOC inputs in most lakes. The highly significant intercept of the respiration to production relationship, 27 mg C m-3 d-1, may indicate the baseline metabolism supported by external sources of C that occurs in these temperate lakes. Estimates of respiratory CO2 production from the pelagial of these lakes range from 11 to 60 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1, depending on lake trophy and DOC concentration. These estimates suggest that the planktonic metabolism of allochthonous DOC probably constitutes a major source of CO2 in lakes.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159													0024-3590					JUN	1994	39	4					772	787		10.4319/lo.1994.39.4.0772	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1994.39.4.0772													WOS:A1994PC98200003
J	BEAUCHAMP, RSA				BEAUCHAMP, RSA			LAKE TANGANYIKA	NATURE												The fauna of L. Tanganyika has aroused great interest because of its abundance of species, many of which are found nowhere else and resemble marine types. The hydrological features of the lake are no less remarkable and provide an explanation for the evolution of so many endemic species. The conc, of salts is unexpectedly low in such an old lake considering that the outlet from the lake is small and intermittent. This is explained by the inflow being of small volume and low salt content, and rain falling directly on the lake accounts for 2/3 of the total water supply.

Diversity of extremophilic bacteria in the sediment of high-altitude lakes located in the mountain desert of Ojos del Salado volcano, Dry-Andes	EXTREMOPHILES												Ojos del Salado, the highest volcano on Earth is surrounded by a special mountain desert with extreme aridity, great daily temperature range, intense solar radiation, and permafrost from 5000 meters above sea level. Several saline lakes and permafrost derived high-altitude lakes can be found in this area, often surrounded by fumaroles and hot springs. The aim of this study was to gain information about the bacterial communities inhabiting the sediment of high-altitude lakes of the Ojos del Salado region located between 3770 and 6500 m. Altogether 11 sediment samples from 4 different altitudes were examined with 16S rRNA gene based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone libraries. Members of 17 phyla or candidate divisions were detected with the dominance of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The bacterial community composition was determined mainly by the altitude of the sampling sites; nevertheless, the extreme aridity and the active volcanism had a strong influence on it. Most of the sequences showed the highest relation to bacterial species or uncultured clones from similar extreme environments.

In a number of samples both dissolved Fe(T) and Fe2+ were also determined. Great care was exercised to minimize any contamination of the samples. Not surprisingly the highest metal concentrations occur in the low-pH, high-Eh regional groundwaters, with much lower values observed in the reflux brines and the neutral Wahpool-Timboram waters. It is thought that the source of these metals to the groundwaters is the dissolution of a suite of heavy minerals within the aquifer, the Pliocene Parilla Sand. As the acid groundwaters flow toward the lake some metals are removed near lake edge at depth. The metal concentrations in the spring zone region indicate an extremely dynamic system, where at different times of the year due to changes in the hydrologic regime metals can be either removed or solubilized.					; Herczeg, Andrew/B-8323-2011; Carey, Anne/Q-9296-2019; Herczeg, Andrew/AAL-4141-2020	Carey, Anne E./0000-0002-0272-5254; Herczeg, Andrew/0000-0002-3788-2743; Welch, Susan/0000-0002-2890-0065; 													0009-2541					MAR 5	1992	96	1-2					115	132		10.1016/0009-2541(92)90124-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(92)90124-N													WOS:A1992HN07100008

The microbes and their by-products in the nucleus induced the precipitation of carbonate, overcoming the inhibition to initiate crystal formation. The enveloping radiating crystals comprising aragonitic cortices tended to grow abiotically producing well-formed euhedral crystals with a paucity of included bacterial fossils. Whereas those cortical crystals made-up of calcite commonly contained bacterial fossils, indicating that the bacterial colonies contributed to the calcitic cortical crystal precipitation. Similar spherulites form a thick, widespread accumulation in the Aptian Pre-Salt lacustrine deposits in the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. As with the travertine, tufa, and caliche spherulites, the Pre-Salt spherulites most likely initiated carbonate precipitation around bacterial colonies and/or their bioproducts, probably while afloat in a lacustrine water column before settling to the water-sediment interface. Absence of inter-spherulite sediment and the spherulite-to-spherulite compaction indicate that cortical crystal growth continued while the spherulites were at the sediment-water interface rather than displacively within a sediment.

DOC correlated with water level at both sites. Mean concentrations of DOC (Murrumbidgil Swamp, 36.0 g m-3; Lake Merrinmajeel, 27.5 g m-3) and POC (15.0 g m-3; 15.5 g m-3) were high compared with other water bodies worldwide, although average for wetlands. The relatively high concentrations of DOC and POC in the study wetlands appear to be the result of their high rates of plant production, and input of leaves from river red gums.																			0018-8158					JUL 23	1993	264	1					13	19		10.1007/BF00014660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014660													WOS:A1993LW09500002

Here, we present a well-dated peat/mud profile with multiple proxies to reconstruct the historic development of Honghe wetland and discuss its response to the East Asian monsoon variations during the Holocene. The results show that the Honghe wetland developed as a shallow-water lake in the mid-early Holocene during a time of high precipitation from the East Asian monsoon. At 4600 years BP, peat layers appeared with sharp increases in the accumulation rate, grainsize Md and arboreal plants, marking a decline in water levels with the relative dry climate. Moreover, the transition corresponds well to the mid-Holocne monsoon weakening event and we suggest the decrease of the monsoon associated precipitation plays a critical role in driving the lake-peatland transition in Honghe. Facing the intensified summer monsoon in future, we suggest some practical measures should be taken to protect the present wetlands from changing back to lakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Soluble organic S constitutents (C-bonded S and ester sulfate) were 1-18% of total S in streams, the water column, and lake outlet. Seston (0.3-1.2% dry mass) in South Lake consisted of ester sulfate (44-59%), C-bonded S (32-43%), sulfate (10-16%), and nonsulfate inorganic S (< 2%). Rates of S deposition measured in sediment traps were highest after spring turnover. The organic matter content (52-81% dry mass) of traps at 5, 8, and 15.5 m showed no significant differences. Net mineralization of seston inputs was 26% based on mass balance calculations, with 43% of the ester sulfate output mineralized. Because most of the S input to the sediments was not mineralized, organic S accumulated and constituted the major (74% of total S) S component of the sediment.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1985	30	6					1196	1207		10.4319/lo.1985.30.6.1196	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1985.30.6.1196													WOS:A1985AVJ1000006

The farming of tilapia has witnessed significant growth due to its high protein content, large size, fast growth, and culinary appeal. However, as aquaculture becomes more intensive, tilapia are increasingly susceptible to emerging infections. Epidemics of tilapia lake virus (TiLV) disease during the summer months have been observed to cause significant mortality in tilapia across various life stages. Seaweed-derived bioactive substances have been extensively studied for their broad antiviral properties. These compounds can enhance the host's immune responses or directly target and inhibit virus replication before it infects host cells. Highlighting the serious concerns of emerging disease in farmed tilapia, and possibility of exploring novel compounds for disease remediation, the present review explores seaweeds as a valuable source of antiviral agents for the development of innovative vaccines and medications against TiLV. The review highlights future research directions to expedite the development of new disease treatments in tilapia farming.					; KHOGEN SINGH, SOIBAM/ESN-7687-2022; Mehta, Naresh/X-4181-2019; Yadav, Nitesh Kumar/JVN-2973-2024; Meena, D.K./KVZ-3197-2024; Meena, Dharmendra/KVZ-3197-2024	Yadav, Nitesh Kumar/0000-0003-4408-0199; Meena, D.K./0000-0003-3764-6617; Debbarma, Sourabh/0000-0002-4767-8201; 													0967-6120	1573-143X				DEC	2024	32	7					10313	10339		10.1007/s10499-024-01663-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-024-01663-5		AUG 2024											WOS:001302655800001

By using a hybrid population model with discrete-time equations and ordinary differential equations, we represent the zebra mussel's life cycle, growth, and population movement. The dynamics of the larvae (unsettled and settled larvae) are represented during the summer months in a system of two ordinary differential equations, while the juvenile, small adult, and large adult stages are represented by a discrete model with yearly time steps. The goal is to investigate the effects of zebra mussel movement between three different spatial locations and possible control measures. Zebra mussel data and temperature values from three locations in the Hudson River over several years were used to estimate model parameters. We investigate the stability and net reproductive number for our model. We illustrate numerically the hybrid population model for several scenarios of movement and cleaning boats to remove mussels.																			1023-6198	1563-5120				AUG 2	2024	30	8			SI		1117	1146		10.1080/10236198.2024.2302015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236198.2024.2302015		FEB 2024											WOS:001169215300001
J	Quinlan, R; Smol, JP				Quinlan, R; Smol, JP			Regional assessment of long-term hypolimnetic oxygen changes in Ontario (Canada) shield lakes using subfossil chironomids	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Subfossil chironomid assemblages were used to infer long-term water quality changes in south-central Ontario shield lakes, which are currently being impacted by anthropogenic eutrophication, acid rain, and recent climate change. Using a transfer function developed to infer average end-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (avg VWHO), a 'top-bottom' paleolimnological approach was used to reconstruct pre-industrial (pre-1850) deepwater oxygen conditions. Comparison with present-day ('top' surface sediments) chironomid-based inferences of avgVWHO results suggest that hypolimnetic oxygen levels are presently similar to natural, pre-industrial ('bottom' sediments) levels in most lakes. Approximately half of the study lakes recorded an increase in hypolimnetic oxygen since the 19th century. Inferred changes in avgVWHO correlate well with our results from another chironomid-based oxygen model which reconstructs the Anoxic Factor (AF). When study lakes are separated according to their hydrological status (i.e., natural versus managed), lakes with a dam at their outlet and seasonally managed lake levels had significantly different changes in avgVWHO compared to lakes with natural hydrology. Lakes with a dam at their outlet generally recorded increases in avgVWHO, while natural hydrology lakes mostly recorded declines. There was no relationship between inferred changes in avgVWHO and the density of cottage and resort development along the shorelines of lakes. Changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) possibly related to recent climate changes may also be affecting deepwater oxygen, however patterns of change are very subtle.

We consider a data set containing all names and locations of about 58,000 lakes in Finland. Using computational techniques, we address two major onomastic themes. First, we address the existence of local dependencies or repulsion between occurrences of names. For this, we derive a simple form of spatial association rules. The results partially validate and partially contradict results obtained by traditional onomastic techniques. Second, we consider the existence of relatively homogeneous spatial regions with respect to the distributions of place names. Using mixture modeling, we conduct a global analysis of the data set. The clusterings of regions are spatially connected, and correspond quite well with the results obtained by other techniques; there are, however, interesting differences with previous hypotheses.

This notification will be required seven days before the event and must be accompanied by objective evidence that justifies the need to use one. The IOC-MC has expressed the viewpoint that, at present, eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea (EVH) is the optimal laboratory challenge to confirm that an athlete has exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The EVH test recommended was specifically designed to identify EIB. EVH has been performed in thousands of subjects in both the laboratory and the field. The test requires the subject to hyperventilate dry air containing 5% carbon dioxide at room temperature for six minutes at a target ventilation of 30 times the subject's forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The test conditions can be modified to simulate the conditions that give the athlete their symptoms with exercise. A reduction in FEV1 of 10% or more of the value before the test is considered positive.

Historically and Currently Used Dechloranes in the Sediments of the Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Dechlorane (mirex), Dechlorane Plus (DP), Dechlorane 602 (Dec602), Dechlorane 603 (Dec603), Dechlorane 604 (Dec604), and Chlordecone (Kepone) were analyzed in 16 sediment cores collected in 2007 from the Great Lakes of North America. Results show that Lake Ontario sediments have accumulated mirex, DP, Dec602 and Dec604 in amounts 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than other Great Lakes. The chemical inventory decreases log linearly with increasing latitude (N) and longitude (W) of the sampling locations, but Lake Ontario sites are outliers in the regression against latitude. The regression analyses suggest differences among the analytes with regard to source impact and long-range transport behavior. Temporal. trends of input differ among lakes. Most sites in Lake Superior are still receiving increasing fluxes of DP and Dec602, while these have been declining in Lake Ontario from the peak around 1990. The relative abundance of the two DP isomers, represented by f(syn), increases with increasing distance from the potential discharge source in Niagara Falls, NY, suggesting the anti-DP isomer is more vulnerable to degradation during long-range atmospheric transport.

The results showed that the macrophyte-covered infralittoral zones were the "hotspots'' of CH4 emission in water systems. There were large temporal variations for CH4 fluxes, ranging from - 1.7 to 131 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), in the macrophyte-covered littoral zone. The highest CH4 emissions occurred during the period of the summer algal bloom. The amount of CH4 flux from June to September accounted for about 50 -90% of the annual fluxes. CH4 fluxes from the bare infralittoral zone ( - 0.2 similar to 4.2 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were low and close to those in the pelagic zone. The difference in CH4 fluxes between macrophyte-covered and bare infralittoral zones indicated that vegetation in the inundated area played an essential role in CH4 production. In the infralittoral zone, the redox condition (DO, Eh), temperature, and primary production controlled CH4 fluxes; these variables explained 47% of flux variation, whereas such influences were not detected in the pelagic zone.

The second mode (M2) occurs most frequently and has the most spacious impact, which featured a mid-high latitudes one-ridge-one-trough pattern at 500 hPa, with persistent cold air from prolonged maintenance blocking ridge over Lake Baikal. Concurrently, the western northward-shifted western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and an active Bay of Bengal Trough enhanced southerly moisture transport from the tropical Pacific Ocean and tropical Indian Ocean, respectively, facilitating precipitation. This saddle-type circulation weakened mid-low latitudes cold air intrusion further to south but enhanced moisture transportation and upper-level divergence, triggering the development during ECPEs in southern China. Comparative analysis revealed that purely extreme cold events (ECEs) demonstrated significant correlation with intensified East Asian winter monsoons, characterized by a persistently extended East Asian trough and prolonged maintenance of the Lake Baikal ridge without active circulation anomalies over mid-low latitudes. This synoptic configuration facilitated enhanced southward penetration of cold air masses, resulting in more pronounced temperature drops across southern China compared with ECPEs. And southern China is located at the entrance of the upper-level jet, and during ECPEs, the jet core of the upper-level shifts more westward with stronger horizontal wind shear and divergence than during ECEs. This configuration facilitates ascent, thereby leading to extreme precipitation over the region. In addition, the first mode (M1) and the third mode (M3) are further studied by comparing with M2, as they have different sources of cold air and water vapor channel from the tropical Indian Ocean through the Indochina Peninsula to southern China. Therefore, M1 and M3 lead to less frequent ECPEs than M2.																			0169-8095	1873-2895				JAN	2026	329								108525	10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108525													WOS:001592575100001

Over the West Kunlun Shan, surge events have been detected for some glaciers, however, the characteristics (e.g., the active phase) of the identified surge-type glaciers are not fully understood due to the paucity of long-term observations of glacier changes. In this study, we investigated the geometric evolution of the Chongce Glacier (a surge-type glacier) over the past five decades. Glacier elevation changes were observed by comparing topographic data from different times. Surface velocity and terminus position were derived using a cross-correlation algorithm and band ratio method, respectively. A decreasing rate of glacier surface thinning was found for the Chongce Glacier during the studied period. Glacier elevation changes of -0.46 +/- 0.12, -0.12 +/- 0.05, and 0.27 +/- 0.11 m yr(-1) were estimated for the periods of 1970-2000, 2000-2012, and 2012-2018, respectively. Moreover, this glacier experienced obvious surface lowering over the terminus zone and clear surface thickening over the upper zone during 1970-2000, and the opposite during 2000-2018. Surface velocity of the Chongce Glacier was less than 300 m yr(-1) in 1990-1993, and then quickly increased to more than 1000 m yr(-1) between 1994 and 1998, and dropped to less than 50 m yr(-1) in 1999-2020. Over the past five decades, the Chongce Glacier generally experienced a slight retreat, except for a terminus advance from 1995 to 1999. According to the spatial pattern of glacier elevation changes in 1970-2000 and the long-term changes of glacier velocity and terminus position, the recent surge event at the Chongce Glacier likely initiated in winter 1993 and terminated in winter 1998. Furthermore, the start date, end date, and duration of the active phase indicate that the detected surge event was likely triggered by a thermal mechanism.					; Wang, Kai/AAT-3039-2020	LIU, Lin/0000-0002-2473-491X; 														2072-4292				SEP	2021	13	18							3759	10.3390/rs13183759	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13183759													WOS:000701467900001
J	Kienast, F; Siegert, C; Dereviagin, A; Mai, DH				Kienast, F; Siegert, C; Dereviagin, A; Mai, DH			Climatic implications of Late Quaternary plant macrofossil assemblages from the Taymyr Peninsula, Siberia	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE					Annual QUEEN Workshop	APR, 2000	LUND, SWEDEN					Plant macrofossil investigations were carried out on Late-Quaternary deposits at Cape Sabler (NW shore of Lake Taymyr, Siberia). Four dated samples (three Late Pleistocene, one Holocene) rich in plant macrofossils were analysed with respect to their floristic composition. The flora of the Holocene sample is similar to the recent plant cover in the study area and is mainly characterized by subarctic and high arctic dwarf-shrubs and hydrophytes. The Pleistocene samples, radiocarbon dated to ca. 30, 27 and 18 ka BP, reflect a species-rich vegetation. The high proportion of pioneer plants within these samples indicates frequent disturbances of the vegetation cover. Furthermore, an almost complete absence of hydrophytes and swamp plants and the dominance of xerophytes, respectively, are typical for the Pleistocene vegetation from the Cape Sabler section. The presence of the tundra-steppe Crassulaceae Orostachys spinosa gives evidence for extremely cryoxeric climatic conditions in the Central Taymyr Peninsula during the Late Pleistocene. The species composition of the Pleistocene samples thus proves the predominance of a continental climate during the Weichselian, which was characterized by a decreased cloud cover, and thus increased direct solar radiation reaching the ground and extreme annual temperature variations. That would have entailed higher summer temperatures, lower precipitation, and longer vegetation periods (due to shorter snowmelt), thus, better conditions than today for the growth of plants in the study area. The higher species diversity in the Weichselian samples confirms this assumption. All these factors caused mainly aerobic soil environments and favourable conditions for seasonal heating of soils.

Currently, prediction of climate change is the most important part of strategic plans. This study was conducted to assess effects of climate changes on surface runoff in Maharlu Lake basin, Iran. We processed climate data during the future period in two general circulation models (MICROC5 and HadGEM2-ES) under radiative forcing scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5), and considered changes in temperature and precipitation to the base period (1980-2013) during P1 (2021-2040), P2 (2041-2060), and P3 (2061-2080). We used statistical indices (interpretation and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients) for assessing the model accuracy. The results showed the model successful simulation of daily runoff. The statistical and SWAT model results at three stations had good accuracy for calibration (NES = 0.72 andR(2) = 0.75) and validation (NES = 0.85 andR(2) = 0.86 similar to 0.92). The basin annual maximum mean temperature during the future period to the base period, under RCP4.5 scenario, increased between 1.45 and 3.94 degrees C, and 1.34 and 5.55 degrees C under RCP8.5 scenario. Annual minimum mean temperatures during future period increased, relative to the base period. This increase under RCP4.5 scenario is 1.20-3.34 degrees C, while 1.28-5.51 degrees C under RCP8.5 scenario. Changes in precipitation vary. The change in the rainy seasons (November to April) is greater than the arid seasons (May to October). Finally, soil and water assessment tool model simulated runoff response during the future period under two different scenarios. In spring, runoff will increase. Climate change is useful for cropping and presenting managerial solutions by managers and policymakers of water resources.

Numerous ornithological observations have drawn our attention to the problem of rapidly progressing overgrowth of the lake and significant fluctuations in its water surface area. These fluctuations, especially in the spring period, significantly limit safe reproduction possibilities of very rare species of water-marsh birds. A multidirectional and comprehensive spectrum of research works allowed us to determine the genesis of the ecosystem and show that the shallow lake is undergoing the final stage in its evolution. The economic aspect of human activity (changes in land use and land development works) has contributed to serious degradation of the ecosystem. Climate changes observed in recent years (increased air temperature and, consequently, higher evaporation) additionally deepen and accelerate this process. The research made it possible to determine how the ecosystem functions today, but it is also an attempt to determine our predictions about its future.					; Slowinski, Michal/B-6546-2011; Kaczmarek, Halina/AEF-4328-2022; Słowiński, Michał/B-6546-2011; Kramkowski, Mateusz/HGC-8797-2022	Tyszkowski, Sebastian/0000-0001-7861-5492; Slowinski, Michal/0000-0002-3011-2682; Kramkowski, Mateusz/0000-0001-8025-7815; Kaczmarek, Halina/0000-0002-0650-8134; Bartczak, Arkadiusz/0000-0002-9285-6273; Slowinska, Sandra/0000-0003-4233-7384														2073-4441				JAN	2019	11	1							32	10.3390/w11010032	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11010032													WOS:000459735100031

Phytoplankton Community and the Relationship with the Environment in Nansi Lake, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This study was carried out from June to October 2008 in Nansi Lake. Based on the data collected from five sampling stations, phytoplankton taxonomic composition, abundance, temporal variations and spatial distribution were examined. About 94 species, including 48 species of Chlorophyta, 22 species of Bacillariophyta, and 1 water bloom causative species were identified. Average phytoplankton diversity index and evenness values were 1.59 and 0.58, respectively, revealing moderate biodiversity of phytoplankton biocoenosis. The phytoplankton abundance averaged 1.52x10(7) cells/L, and was much higher than previous investigation carried out in the same months in 1995. The species of Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta dominated phytoplankton community. The main dominant species were Scenedesmus dimorphus, Chlorella vulgaris, Synedra acus, Aulacoseira granulata, Merismopedia tenuissima and Mona/Ian/us brevicylindms. Concerning nutrient stoichiometry, it was suggested that the higher TN: TP ratio indicated potential P-limitation for phytoplankton growth in Nansi Lake. The environmental conditions of water quality and phytoplankton community composition indicated that Nansi Lake was eutrophic in summer.																			1735-6865	2008-2304				WIN	2011	5	1					167	176																WOS:000285682200018

Role of tributary cyanobacterial and nutrient transport and sediment processes on cyanobacterial bloom initiation in Lake Superior nearshore	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Watershed fluxes of suspended sediment (SS), nutrients, in particular phosphorus (P), and cyanobacteria may play a role in driving cyanobacterial blooms along the southwestern shore of oligotrophic Lake Superior. To understand how tributary loads contribute to nearshore blooms, we sampled two southwestern shore tributaries, Bois Brule and Siskiwit Rivers. We collected water-quality samples to compute nutrient and sediment loads and to assess cyanobacteria community composition from the tributaries to the nearshore. We collected suspended and streambed sediment to assess the capacity for sediment to store and transport bioavailable P and to assess cyanobacteria community composition. Storm flows drove export of SS, total P, and total nitrogen, with the majority of total P being particulate P. Equilibrium P concentrations revealed that SS sorbed P as it is moved through the stream network across sites and seasons and was a potential source of P to the nearshore. However, streambed sediment in the Bois Brule and Siskiwit River watersheds were P sinks during summer, which potentially delayed transport of dissolved P to the lake. The cyanobacteria community varied spatially and temporally relating to multiple environmental variables including nutrients (P, N, and C) and specific conductivity. Cyanobacteria capable of producing cyanotoxins were present in tributaries and found across multiple environmental compartments indicating a potential for fluvial flow to the nearshore. This study demonstrated that streamflow is a primary driver of total nutrient and sediment loading in both watersheds, which indicates the potential for algal loading to the nearshore via suspended sediment or water.																			0380-1330					FEB	2025	51	1							102409	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102409		JAN 2025											WOS:001415911700001

Vegetation and climate change during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age on the southern Cape coast of South Africa: Pollen evidence from Bo Langvlei	HOLOCENE												This paper presents continuous, high resolution fossil pollen and microcharcoal records from Bo Langvlei, a lake in the Wilderness Embayment on South Africa's southern Cape coast. Spanning the past similar to 1300 years and encompassing the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; c. AD 950-1250) and the Little Ice Age (LIA; c. AD 1300-1850), these records provide a rare southern African perspective on past temperature, moisture and vegetation change during these much debated periods of the recent geological past. Considered together with other records from the Wilderness Embayment, we conclude that conditions in the region during the MCA chronozone were - in the context of the last 1300 years - likely relatively dry (reduced levels of Afrotemperate forest pollen) and perhaps slightly cooler (increased percentages of Stoebe-type pollen) than present. The most significant phase of forest expansion, and more humid conditions, occurred during the transition between the MCA and the most prominent cooling phase of the LIA. The LIA is clearly identified at this locality as a period of cool, dry conditions between c. AD 1600 and 1850. The mechanisms driving the changes observed in the Bo Langvlei pollen record appear to be generally linked to changes in temperature, and changes in the influence of tropical circulation systems. During warmer periods, moisture availability was higher at Bo Langvlei, and rainfall was perhaps less seasonal. During colder periods, precipitation resulting from tropical disturbances was more restricted, resulting in drier conditions. While increased precipitation has been reported during the LIA from Verlorenvlei in the Western Cape as a result of an equatorward displacement of the westerly storm-track at this time, the opposing response at Bo Langvlei suggests that any increased influence of westerlies was insufficient to compensate for the concurrent reduction in tropical/local rainfall in the region.					; Meadows, Michael/AAH-2461-2020; Chase, Brian/A-1202-2010; Quick, Lynne/A-1511-2018; Haberzettl, Torsten/AAV-9216-2021	Du Plessis, Nadia/0000-0003-0290-4866; Meadows, Michael/0000-0001-8322-3055; Chase, Brian/0000-0001-6987-1291; Quick, Lynne/0000-0002-6735-7106; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2020	30	12					1716	1727	0959683620950444	10.1177/0959683620950444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620950444		AUG 2020											WOS:000562094100001

Strong positive relationships were identified between 1) bacterial production and bacterial abundance and 2) bacterial production and algal biomass. The relationship between bacterial production and bacterial abundance was improved by also considering water temperature. The analysis of covariance model revealed consistent differences between fresh, marine and estuarine/coastal waters, with production consistently high in estuarine/coastal environments. The log-linear regression coefficient of abundance was not significantly different from 1.00, and this linear relationship permitted the use of specific growth rate (SGR in day-1) as a dependent variable. A strong relationship was identified between specific growth rate and temperature. This relationship differed slightly across the three habitats. A substantial portion of the residual variation from this relationship was accounted for by algal biomass, including the difference between marine and estuarine/coastal habitats. A small but significant difference between the fresh- and saltwater habitats remained. No significant difference between the chlorophyll effect in different habitats was identified. The model of SGR against temperature and chlorophyll was much weaker for freshwater than for marine environments. For a small subset of the data set, mean cell volume accounted for some of the residual variation in SGR. Pronounced seasonality, fluctuations in nutrient quality, and variation of the grazing environment may contribute to the unexplained variation in specific growth.					; Gasol, Josep M/B-1709-2008; Gasol, Josep/B-1709-2008	white, paul/0000-0001-5853-4759; Gasol, Josep M/0000-0001-5238-2387; 													0095-3628						1991	21	2					99	118		10.1007/BF02539147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02539147								24194204					WOS:A1991FN75600002

Responses of diatoms to the Younger Dryas climatic reversal in a South Carpathian mountain lake (Romania)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A high-resolution paleolimnological study from Lake Brazi, a small mountain lake in the Southern Carpathian Mountains, Romania, shows distinct diatom responses to late glacial and early Holocene climate change between ca. 15,750 and 10,000 cal year BP. Loss-on-ignition, titanium, sulphur, phosphorus, biogenic silica content, and diatom assemblage composition were used as proxies for past environmental changes. Total epilimnetic phosphorus (TP) concentrations and lakewater pH were reconstructed quantitatively using diatom-TP and pH transfer functions. The most remarkable changes in the aquatic ecosystem were found at ca. 12,870 and 10,400 cal year BP. Whereas the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD) climatic reversal was conspicuous in our record, the beginning of the Holocene was not well marked. Two diatom assemblage zones characterize the YD in Lake Brazi, suggesting a bipartite division of this climatic oscillation. The diatom responses to the YD cooling were (1) a shift from Staurosira venter to Stauroforma exiguiformis dominance; (2) a decrease in overall diatom diversity; (3) a decrease in lake productivity, inferred from DI-TP, organic matter, and biogenic silica content; and (4) a lowering of the DI-pH. Compositional change of the diatom assemblages suggested a sudden shift towards more acidic lake conditions at 12,870 cal year BP, which is interpreted as a response to prolonged ice cover and thus shorter growing seasons and/or enhanced outwash of humic acids from the catchment. Taking into account the chironomid-based inference of only moderate July mean temperature decrease (< 1 A degrees C), together with the pollen-inferred regional opening of the forest cover and expansion of steppe-tundra, our data suggest that ecosystem changes in the Southern Carpathians during the YD were likely determined by strong seasonal changes.					; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Buczkó, Krisztina/AAO-3762-2020; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008	Hubener, Thomas/0000-0001-6291-9192; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809													0921-2728					AUG	2012	48	2					417	431		10.1007/s10933-012-9618-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9618-1													WOS:000305959000010

Here, we studied the depth profile of temperature and biochemical parameters in Longjing Lake, a subtropical reservoir in a mountainous city. Thermal stratification became strong during summer. Biochemical parameters were strongly associated with thermal structure. Stratification started at 2 similar to 6 m depth with a substantial decrease in dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chlorophyll a, and pH, corresponding to an increase in total nitrogen, ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), total phosphorus, and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) with depth; the majority of biochemical parameters showed slight variations from 12 m downward. Our results indicated the stratification of Longjing Lake was stronger and more stable than the stratification of tropical and temperate lakes in lowland cities.					; Li, Hong/AEO-4662-2022	Su, Xiaoxuan/0000-0001-6965-7084; 													1061-4303	1554-7531				DEC	2018	90	12					2036	2048		10.2175/106143017X15131012188178	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143017X15131012188178								30538012					WOS:000454205300003

ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY					34th Annual Meeting of the Alaska-Anthropological-Association	MAR, 2007	Fairbanks, AK	Alaska Anthropol Assoc				The Archaic stage was defined as a cultural response to post-Pleistocene landscapes dominated by trees. The Early Holocene produced an open landscape susceptible to colluviation, flooding, and gullying thus placing severe constraints on archaeological site preservation. The paleo-environment surrounding the development of the Northern Archaic can be reconstructed from pan-Alaska proxy records of flooding, loess fall, and soil formation at Onion Portage and Tingmiukpuk, and using a variety of studies of lake levels, glacial expansions, and slope activations, supplemented by loess and dune stratigraphy from the Tanana and Nenana valleys. The development of the Northern Archaic correlates with the retreat of the treeline, but may be inversely related to the development of peatland and forest landscapes at 7 kya in that the treeless Brooks Range attracted Archaic peoples north as the sphagnum peatland developed in the interior.

Transalpine routes connecting northern Italy with the northern Alps during these slots is consistent with late Holocene maximum glacier retreat. The age cohorts of the artefacts are separated which is indicative of glacier advances when the route was difficult and not used for transit. The preservation of Neolithic leather indicates permanent ice cover at that site from ca. 4900 cal. yr BP until AD 2003, implying that the ice cover was smaller in 2003 than at any time during the last 5000 years. Current glacier retreat is unprecedented since at least that time. This is highly significant regarding the interpretation of the recent warming and the rapid loss of ice in the Alps.

J	Jones, RI; Grey, J; Quarmby, C; Sleep, D				Jones, RI; Grey, J; Quarmby, C; Sleep, D			Sources and fluxes of inorganic carbon in a deep, oligotrophic lake (Loch Ness, Scotland)	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The main river inflows to Loch Ness and several depths in the water column within the loch were sampled over an annual cycle. The carbon isotope composition of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the samples was determined as well as that of phytoplankton from the loch. Values of delta C-13 for DIC in the rivers indicated that this DIC was derived from soil respiration in the catchment and achieved only partial equilibrium with the atmosphere during river transport. Riverine loading accounted for most of the DIC in Loch Ness, and the great depth of the loch relative to its surface area allows only limited exchange with the atmosphere. Despite the low productivity in Loch Ness, DIC concentrations in the low alkalinity water are appreciably influenced by plankton metabolism. and seasonal fluctuations in delta C-13 of DIC and phytoplankton revealed the particular impact of photosynthetic carbon fixation on DIC. However, the photosynthetic depletion of DIC during summer does not offset the riverine loading sufficiently to prevent the loch waters being supersaturated with CO2 throughout the year. Annual efflux of CO2 from Loch Ness is estimated to be 253 x 10(6) mol yr(-1), of which around one quarter may be due to net heterotrophic mineralization within the loch of organic carbon of terrestrial origin. The remainder is attributable to inorganic carbon input to the lake via river inflow and derived from prior mineralization of soil organic matter within the drainage area. This annual efflux of CO2 can represent around 6% of net ecosystem production in the catchment.

Scientific and stakeholder evidence-based assessment: Ecosystem response to floating solar photovoltaics and implications for sustainability	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												Floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) installations are increasing globally. However, their interaction with the hosting water body and implications for ecosystem function is poorly understood. Understanding potential impacts is critical as water bodies provide many ecosystem services on which humans rely and are integral for delivering the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we used scientific evidence from a systematic review and stakeholder expertise, captured through an international survey and a workshop, alongside existing understanding of the role of water bodies in delivering ecosystem services and the SDGs. We found 22 evidence outcomes that indicated potential physical, chemical and biological impacts of FPV on water bodies. Assessment by stakeholders from across sectors indicated that reduced water evaporation is the greatest opportunity, whilst changes to water chemistry, including nitrification and deoxygenation, are the greatest threat. Despite these findings, FPV operators reported no observed water quality or ecosystem impacts. However, only 15% of respondents had performed water quality analysis; visual inspection alone cannot ascertain all water quality impacts. Based on the integration of these findings, we determined that FPV could impact nine ecosystem services. Furthermore, established linkages between ecosystem services and SDGs indicate the potential for impacts on eight SDGs, although whether the impact is positive or negative is likely to depend on FPV design and water body type. Our results further the understanding of the effects of FPVs on host water bodies and may help to ensure the anticipated growth in FPVs minimises threats and maximises opportunities, safeguarding overall sustainability.					; Exley, Giles/AAD-1669-2021	Exley, Giles/0000-0001-7402-3895; Hernandez, Rebecca/0000-0002-8031-2949; 													1364-0321	1879-0690				DEC	2021	152								111639	10.1016/j.rser.2021.111639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.111639		SEP 2021											WOS:000708523200003
J	Bockheim, JG				Bockheim, JG			Genesis of bisequal soils on acidic drift in the upper Great Lakes region, USA	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Seventeen bisequal pedons were characterized on drift primarily from the Greatlakean advance [ca. 12 000 yr before present (BP)] in northern Wisconsin and the upper Michigan. The pedons, Alfic Haplorthods and Alfic Oxyaquic Fragiorthods, contain an Orthod sequum over an Udalf sequum and are derived primarily from coarse-loamy or coarse-silty materials overlying stratified sand and gravel or coarse-loamy materials. The upper sequum contains abundant roots and is very strongly acidic (pH 4.8), low in clay (<4.8%) and base cations (<20% base saturation), and high in exchangeable acidity (13 cmol(c) kg(-1)) and exchangeable Al (60% saturation). The lower sequum contains few roots, is strongly acidic (pH 5.4), is more enriched in clay (8.0%) and base cations (45% base saturation), and has lower exchangeable acidity and A] than the upper sequum. The occurrence and position of argillic and fragic horizons in the profile are favored by a lithologic discontinuity. The two horizons may form exclusive of one another. On the basis of soil solution chemistry data and mass-balance studies, the argillic horizon has formed from neoformation of clays with some clay migration. The fragic materials are of pedogenic origin and are forming in the upper part of a degrading argillic horizon. The soils have undergone environmental changes during the past 12 000 yr, but they appear to have originated from processes that are occurring today that result from extensive leaching during melting of the spring snowpack and solute movement in two-storied parent materials. The soils are strongly developed in view of the short snow-free season.																			0361-5995					MAR-APR	2003	67	2					612	619																WOS:000181461900027

Coordinated investigation of summer time mid-latitude descending E layer (Es) perturbations using Na lidar, ionosonde, and meteor wind radar observations over Logan, Utah (41.7°N, 111.8°W)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												It is well known that there is a strong correlation between the formation of a descending sporadic E layer (E-s) and the occurrence of large upper atmospheric zonal wind shears, most likely driven by solar thermal tides and/or gravity waves. We present new results of E-s perturbation events captured between 13 and 17 July 2011 (UT days 194-198) as part of a coordinated campaign using a wind/temperature Na lidar at Utah State University [41.7 degrees N, 111.8 degrees W], and a Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde (CADI; Scientific Instrumentation Ltd., Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada) and SkiYMet meteor wind radar, both located at nearby Bear Lake Observatory [41.9 degrees N, 111.4 degrees W]. During this period, the CADI detected strong descending E-s on 2 days (195 and 197) when large modulations of the top-side mesospheric Na layer occurred in synchronism with strong oscillations in the ionosonde E region echoes. A weakening in the descending E layer echoes was observed on the other 2 days (196 and 198) coincident with a large reduction in the zonal diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes above 95 km. Both tidal components were found to have comparable contributions to the total zonal wind shear that was critical for E-s formation and its downward propagation. Further investigation indicates that the weakening tidal amplitudes and the occurrence of the E-s events were also influenced by a strong quasi-two-day period modulation, suggesting significant quasi-two-day wave (QTDW) interactions with the tides. Indeed, a nonlinear, wave-wave interaction-induced 16-hour period child wave was also detected, with amplitude comparable to that of the prevailing tides. These interaction processes and their associated effects are consistent with earlier Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model studies of nonlinear interactions between the migrating tidal waves and the QTDW and were probably responsible for the observed damping of the tidal amplitudes resulting in the disruption of the E-s.

J	Yamamoto, Y; Nakahara, H				Yamamoto, Y; Nakahara, H			The formation and degradation of cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon flos-aquae blooms: the importance of pH, water temperature, and day length	LIMNOLOGY												Investigation of annual changes in phytoplankton community structure in a small artificial eutrophic pond was carried out from May 2002 to April 2003. A heavy bloom of Aphanizonienon flos-aquae var. klebahnii Elenk. (Cyanobacteria) persisted in most of the water column from June to the end of October. In November, the A. flos-aquae bloom suddenly crashed and green algae were predominant until the end of spring. Weekly monitoring suggested strong involvement of the changes in abiotic factors in the cyanobacterial bloom degradation. To clarify the effects of pH, water temperature, and day length on the growth of A. flos-aquae, laboratory batch experiments were conducted. The results showed that A. flos-aquae could not grow below pH 7.1 and 11 degrees C, and the growth tended to be suppressed under a 10L:14D photoperiod. pH, water temperature, and day length are vital factors in the growth of A. flos-aquae and, additionally, grazing by cyclopoid copepods also seemed important in bloom collapse.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2005	6	1					1	6		10.1007/s10201-004-0138-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-004-0138-1													WOS:000228456000001

Distribution of the schistosome intermediate snail host Biomphalaria pfeifferi in East Africa's river systems and the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												Background There is a need for current and more detailed information on the distribution of Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails in East Africa's river systems. B. pfeifferi is arguably the most important snail intermediate host in the transmission of schistosomiasis, a disease ranked second to malaria in terms of tropical diseases of public health importance. Methods We assessed the occurrence and geographical distribution of B. pfeifferi snails in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Maximum entropy modelling was used to predict the potential distribution of B. pfeifferi snails and malacological surveys were conducted guided by MaxEnt predictions and information from previous studies. Malacological surveys were conducted at a total of 172 sites, including streams, rivers, dams, irrigation schemes and springs over a 3-y period from 2018 to 2020, with geospatial, ecological and physicochemical information recorded for each site. Results B. pfeifferi snails were found at 23 of the 172 sites and inhabited a variety of habitat types. Of the 23 sites where B. pfeifferi snails were found, 15 (65.2%) were streams, 3 rivers (13.04%), 2 dams (8.7%), 2 springs (8.7%) and 1 an irrigation scheme (4.35%). B. pfeifferi abundance showed a significant positive correlation with increasing water temperature and decreasing water depth. In Kenya, B. pfeifferi snails were found around the Lake Victoria basin, the Mwea irrigation scheme and in parts of the former Eastern Province of Kenya. In Uganda, B. pfeifferi snails were found in Jinja District, Ntoroko District and Soroti District. In Tanzania, B. pfeifferi snails were found in the Iringa, Tabora and Kigoma Regions. We observed moderate to high prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection, with S. mansoni-infected snails found at 11 of 23 sites and with an average prevalence of 24.9% at infected sites. In Kenya, S. mansoni-infected snails were found in the Lake Victoria basin (22.5% prevalence at infected sites) and the former Eastern Province (13.5% prevalence at infected sites). In Uganda, infected snails were found in Ntoroko District (100% infected) and Soroti District (20% infected). In Tanzania, infected snails were found in the Kigoma Region, with a prevalence of 10% at the infected site. Conclusion This information on the distribution of B. pfeifferi snails and S. mansoni infection in East Africa's river systems can aid in developing better prevention and control strategies for human schistosomiasis. Regular surveys of the river systems for snail intermediate hosts followed by molecular detection of schistosome infection could form a basis for the development of a prompt and cost-effective surveillance system for schistosomiasis in the region.

Strontium Isotopic Signatures of Streams from Taylor Valley, Antarctica, Revisited: The Role of Carbonate Mineral Dissolution	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												We have collected and analyzed a larger set of stream waters for major ions and strontium isotopes in Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. These new data substantiate the concept that the dissolution of carbonate minerals is a significant source of strontium, even in polar desert environments where liquid water is primarily limited to stream channels. In Taylor Valley, most of the carbonate minerals present are the result of secondary processes, such as mineral precipitation and/or eolian deposition, and not through primary geologic sources, such as bedrock or till sources. In Von Guerard Stream (Lake Fryxell basin) and Andersen Creek (Lake Hoare basin), water samples were collected during the austral summer to determine short-term Sr-87/Sr-86 patterns. The observed variability in both time and space may be dependent on the relative amounts of primary and secondary carbonates present in the streambeds and hyporheic zone as well as contingent on the relative proportions of carbonate and aluminosilicate weathering.

J	Scott, AC; Cripps, JA; Collinson, ME; Nichols, GJ				Scott, AC; Cripps, JA; Collinson, ME; Nichols, GJ			The taphonomy of charcoal following a recent heathland fire and some implications for the interpretation of fossil charcoal deposits	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					Meeting on Fire and the Palaeoenvironment	APR, 1997	UNIV SHEFFIELD, SHEFFIELD, ENGLAND	Univ Sheffield Archaeol Soc	UNIV SHEFFIELD			In May 1995, fire burnt an area of heathland with stands of pine and birch trees in the Frensham Common Country Park near Tilford in Surrey, southeast England. Extensive areas were burnt by a rapidly spreading surface fire, and charcoal was produced from both the living plants and plant litter. Flames reached a height of no more than 2 m so that whilst much of the low growing vegetation was destroyed, the trees generally survived the burn. Samples were taken of unburnt living plants and unburnt litter as well as charcoal from heathland and adjacent woodland and small channels running through the locality. Much of the heathland charcoal was produced from living vegetation and included wood, leafy shoots, flowers and fruits of Calluna vulgaris (common heather) and rachises and pinnae of the fern Pteridium aquilinum (bracken). The surface peaty layer here was only charred to a depth of 1 or 2 mm. In contrast, the bulk of the charcoal from the Pinus sylvestris (scots pine) and Betula pendula (silver birch) trees was from litter, none of the lower branches of the trees having caught alight. Only a few fallen logs produced much wood charcoal. Fallen P. sylvestris female cones were typically only charred upon their upward-facing surface. Strong winds across the heathland following the fire gathered the charred C. vulgaris small leafy shoots, flowers and fruits into ripple concentrates. Movement of the charcoal by water following rain storms was also tracked from the heathland onto bare crossing paths and into depressions and channels as well as into a small nearby lake. Water transport resulted in selective bias in favour of wood charcoal. None of the other charred organs reached the lake. Scanning electron microscopy shows that a wide range of plant taxa and organs may be anatomically preserved by charcoalification, and plants covered with fungal hyphae (possibly indicating decomposition) were also found charred. Studies of samples in polished blocks show that all plant organs have increased reflectance under oil. Mean random reflectance under oil of all samples was 1.53 (range 0.13-6.22), which indicates that if preserved in the fossil record, they would be classified as the coal maceral semifusinite. Comparisons with fossil deposits are made, and this study may contribute to our understanding of charcoalified flower concentrates (e.g the late Cretaceous of Sweden and the USA) and deposits rich in few charcoal (e.g. of the early Cretaceous of southern England).

J	Pehlivanov, L				Pehlivanov, L			Water outflow as a cause of changes in trophic conditions for zooplanktivorous fish in reservoirs	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												The seasonal changes and vertical distribution of zooplankton, the export of zooplankters by outflow through water management installations, and the feeding of zooplanktivorous fish were studied in two Bulgarian reservoirs. In a bottom-draining reservoir, planktonic crustacea > 1.0 mm were found to be selectively exported as a result of their diurnal vertical migrations. Increases in water outflow for irrigation resulted in a decrease in total zooplankton abundance, as well as changes in zooplankton size and species composition at the beginning of the summer. At the same time, major changes occurred in the feeding patterns of bleak, Alburnus alburnus (L.), and juvenile pikeperch, Stizostedion lucioperca (L.), the principal zooplanktivores in this reservoir. It is easy for bleak to switch to feeding on an alternative food, but a lack of available large prey organisms is suggested as the main cause of the downstream movement of pikeperch juveniles. In a surface-draining reservoir, the pattern of zooplankton export corresponded to those in natural lakes. Discharged water carried with it mainly small-sized epilimnetic zooplankton from the most numerous groups (i.e, rotifers, juvenile copepods and cladocerans) in the reservoir. Furthermore, outflow exports represent a relatively small part of total zooplankton number, and thus, do not disturb the natural zooplankton succession, and changes in abundance and composition Coincidental changes in the trophic responses for zooplanktivores (mainly juvenile cyprinids and percids) were not found.																			0969-997X					FEB	2000	7	1-2					115	125		10.1046/j.1365-2400.2000.00201.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.2000.00201.x													WOS:000086118800013
J	Holopainen, S; Nummi, P; Pöysä, H				Holopainen, Sari; Nummi, Petri; Poysa, Hannu			Breeding in the stable boreal landscape: lake habitat variability drives brood production in the teal (Anas crecca)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Boreal forest lakes are normally considered stable environments, but from a duck's point of view, both resource abundance and habitat quality in the lakes may differ from 1year to another. Duck species differ in their flexibility to respond to variation in environmental factors, such as habitat quality, habitat variability and weather. Anas crecca, the common teal, has been suggested to be a species that can readily colonise newly formed habitat. We studied the effect of habitat quality (invertebrate food resources, amount of spring flood, beaver flood abundance, predation pressure), weather (temperature, precipitation, timing of ice break-up) and pair abundance on breeding success of teal at the landscape scale in Southern Finland. We used 20years of data (1989-2008) from a study area consisting of 50 lakes. This is typical boreal breeding area for the teal, whose population size is markedly variable. We express breeding success as number of broods in two different age classes. The number of broods in both age classes was explained well by habitat quality, but different variables seem to operate during different phases of the breeding season. Increases in abundance of breeding pairs and of food led to increased production of younger broods. Habitat factors including food and flood abundance were the most important predictors for older broods, which are the more influential in terms of recruitment. These factors manifested in an age-specific manner, highlighting the importance of comprehensive breeding time surveys of boreal breeding ducks to understand variation in their recruitment. Our research underlines the importance of high-quality habitats for breeding teal populations in the boreal forest landscape. The existence of these habitats depends substantially on human actions, such as managing beaver populations and preserving seasonal pond habitats.					; Pöysä, Hannu/JBS-4832-2023; Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021	Holopainen, Sari/0000-0002-3271-4468; Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2014	59	12					2621	2631		10.1111/fwb.12458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12458													WOS:000344778800014

The Fengcheng Formation contains large volumes of high-quality source rocks, which form not only in the depocenter but also in the wide, shallow lake margins. The source rocks analyzed in this study are different from those in most other ancient lakes in the following aspects: genesis and occurrence of organic matter, kerogen type, lithological composition, and hydrocarbon migration pathway. This study showed that the Fengcheng Formation has high hydrocarbon generation potential and that combinations of multiple paths enhanced the hydrocarbon expulsion and migration. Benthic microbial mats and algae that bloomed in the alkaline saline lake represent the dominant types of organic matter. Due to their specific composition, the evaporites may have catalyzed hydrocarbon generation via organic-inorganic interactions, while intergranular seams in bedded/laminated evaporites provided paths for hydrocarbon migration. Stylolites, with high contents of brittle minerals and low clay content, also allowed favorable paths for hydrocarbon expulsion and migration. Combining hydrocarbon expulsion fractures in the organic-rich laminae, fractures and microfractures caused by compressive tectonic stress, pathway networks formed that enhanced the efficiencies of both hydrocarbon expulsion and migration.

From the individual filtering rates of the different populations and the densities community grazing rates were derived. Copepoda made up 79-90% of crustacean plankton community in the open lake and 95-97% of it in littoral zone. Among them the nauplii dominated. At the end of summer 1982, when Anabaenopsis was in bloom, the filter-feeding species (Eudiaptomus, Daphnia) practically disappeared, being replaced by cyclopoids. Daphnia had the highest filtering rates followed by those of Eudiaptomus and Diaphanosoma. Among copepods, the filtering rates in decreasing order were: ovigerous .female. > all adults > copepodites > nauplii. .female. > .male.. The filtering rates of the different species varied both seasonally as well as from year to year. In 1983, when the concentration of organic seston decreased, filtering rate increased compared with those in the earlier years. During the water bloom in 1982, the rates decreased by 70% on the average. The community grazing rate was very low (3% per day) in the open lake and among macrophytes, both in 1981 and 1982; also the share of crustacean zooplankton in grazing was very low. In 1983, together with the improving of water quality, the community grazing rate increased 4-fold. In 1981 and 1983 the rates were influenced by water temperature but in 1982 by seston concentration.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 10	1986	135	1-2					131	147		10.1007/BF00006465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006465													WOS:A1986E914500014

J	Hang, T				Hang, T			A local clay-varve chronology and proglacial sedimentary environment in glacial Lake Peipsi, eastern Estonia	BOREAS												Ten cores consisting of varved clay from the northern part of Lake Peipsi in eastern Estonia have been correlated using varve thickness variations and specific marker varves into a 375-year floating varve chronology. Continuous sedimentation during gradual ice recession is concluded from a clear transition from proximal to distal varves. Cyclic variations in varve thickness are caused mainly by thickness changes of clayey winter layers. This is interpreted to indicate increased influx of finer material due to faster melting of the glacier. The cyclic pattern of thickness change is explained by alternating periods of increased and decreased melting of the ice. Simultaneous accumulation of varved clay in glacial Lake Peipsi and in the Luga and Neva basins of Russia is concluded from the good visual correlation between the mean varve thickness diagrams for the three chronologies. Because the varve chronologies from northwestern Russia have been tentatively correlated to the Swedish varve chronology, the timing of the clay accumulation in glacial Lake Peipsi is placed between c. 13500 and 13100 varve years BP.					; Hang, Tiit/G-1510-2017	Hang, Tiit/0000-0002-8486-7052; 													0300-9483	1502-3885					2003	32	2					416	426		10.1080/03009480301821	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009480301821													WOS:000183176200012

(2) While all species attained maximum biomass and morphological diversity at 1.5 m in 100% fertile sediment and minimum biomass in the least fertile sediment, the effects of sediment composition and irradiance on growth differed between the species. (3) Biomass of the erect P. praelongus was primarily determined by sediment composition whereas the biomass of the bottom-dwelling P. robbinsii was largely determined by irradiance: the intermediate, rosette-form. V. americana, showed an intermediate response.

An examination of Minnesota's muskellunge waters	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We examined Minnesota's muskellunge, Esox masquinongy, populations using various data sets including spring trap net assessments and angler diary surveys. We confronted a potentially problematic data set that had a large number of zero catches by fitting logistic models to the presence/absence data set and linear models to the subset of data that included catches with one fish or more. Currently, 105 lakes have been identified as muskellunge waters, of which 61 lakes have been created and maintained by stocking. Although the proportion of successful anglers has increased over time, catch rates have remained the same. It appears from analysis of trap net catches that the abundance of 102 cm (40 in) and larger muskellunge has been increasing over time. Both trap net and angler data provide some indications that size of muskellunge caught has also increased over time. Angler-harvested muskellunge averaged 11 years of age and 115 cm (45 in) total length. For Minnesota waters, muskellunge ultimate length averaged 134 cm (53 in) for females and 119 cm (47 in) for males. All evidence indicates a successful management program.																			0378-1909					JUN	2007	79	1-2					125	136		10.1007/s10641-006-9168-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9168-3													WOS:000245869600012
J	Luo, Q; Li, Y; Cao, XY; Jiang, SF; Yu, HB				Luo, Qiao; Li, Yong; Cao, Xueyou; Jiang, Shufang; Yu, Hongbing			The Spatial and Temporal Variability of the Blue-Green Spatial Structures of the South Dongting Lake Wetland Areas Amidst Climate Change, including Its Relationship with Meteorological Factors	WATER												In recent years, the water level of the Dongting Lake (DTL) has been continuously low, and the wetland area and landscape pattern have changed significantly. Considering the obvious spatial heterogeneity of water regime changes in different waters of the DTL, this paper takes two core areas of the South Dongting Lake Nature Reserve (SDLNR) as study areas and analyzes the spatial distribution characteristics of the wetland blue-green landscape patterns by using remote sensing image data and hydrological and meteorological data. The multi-scale correlation between runoff, precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration in the SDLNR was studied via cross-wavelet transform analysis. The results show the following: (1) The change in the blue-green spatial patterns in different regions in different periods is inconsistent, and this inconsistency is related to the topography, climate, and human activities in each region; (2) there are seasonal fluctuations in precipitation, air temperature, and evapotranspiration in the SDLNR. Among them, the annual mean temperature shows a rising trend and passes the significance test with 95% confidence, while the annual mean precipitation and annual mean evapotranspiration show no significant change trend; and (3) our Pearson correlation analysis and cross-wavelet change results show that precipitation and temperature are strongly correlated with runoff, with a resonance period of 8-16 months, while the correlation between evapotranspiration and runoff is not significant. We recommend that policymakers establish an effective early warning system and make plans to store water through micro-terrain transformation in possible climate change treatments and strategies.

J	Guo, NC; Xie, P				Guo, Nichun; Xie, Ping			Development of tolerance against toxic Microcystis aeruginosa in three cladocerans and the ecological implications	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												This is the first experimental study to compare difference in the development of tolerance against toxic Microcystis among multi-species of cladocerans (Daphnia, Moina and Ceriodaphnia) pre-exposed to two M. aeruginosa PCC7820 strains (MC-containing and MC-free). Zooplankton were divided into S population (fed Scenedesmus), M-F population (fed Scenedesmus + MC-free Microcystis), and M-C population (fed Scenedesmus + MC-containing Microcystis). M-F and M-C populations were pre-exposed to Microcystis strains for 4 weeks, and their newborns were collected for experiments. A pre-exposure to MC-containing or MC-free Microcystis increased tolerance against toxic Microcystis. The marked increases in survival rate and median lethal time (LT50, 100-194% increase) in the M-C population of Ceriodaphnia suggest that small-sized cladocerans may develop stronger tolerance against Microcystis than large-sized ones when both groups are exposed to toxic Microcystis. This may explain why dominant Daphnia is usually replaced by small-sized cladocerans when cyanobacteria bloomed in summer in eutrophic lakes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Paleomagnetism of the wintering lake pluton and the Early Proterozoic tectonic motion of the Superior boundary zone, Manitoba	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												This Lithoprobe-funded paleomagnetic study of the Early Proterozoic Wintering Lake granitoid body supports tectonic models that suggest continental accretion of the Trans-Hudson Orogen with the Superior Craton occurred at similar to 1822 Ma. Thermal demagnetization data for the granitoid specimens suggest that the magnetic remanence carriers are coarse-grained magnetite or titanomagnetite, and saturation isothermal remanence tests suggest that the magnetite is mostly multidomain. Six of seven paleomagnetic contact tests were negative, indicating that the host rocks have been remagnetized and that the granitoid body may have been partially remagnetized near its margins. Acceptable site mean remanence directions for 20 of 21 granitic sites yield a paleopole at 46.8 degrees N, 102.2 degrees W (with semi-axes of the 95% ellipse of confidence about the paleopole of dp = 11 degrees and dm = 11 degrees). The paleopole fits on the extrapolated apparent polar wander path (APWP) for the Superior craton at similar to 1822 Ma, which is the interpreted emplacement age of the pluton close to the peak of the Trans-Hudson orogeny. This is the first well-constrained paleomagnetic result from the Superior Province that provides direct evidence from concordant paleopoles for the Early Proterozoic accretion of the orogen to the craton. Further, the paleomagnetic results from the pluton's host rocks, along with other recent results from the Superior Boundary Zone, fill in a gap in the APWP for the craton between similar to 1780 and similar to 1720 Ma. The Superior path is now shown to form a hairpin as the craton moves from mid to polar paleolatitudes from similar to 1880 to similar to 1830 Ma, suffers a stillstand from similar to 1830 to similar to 1770 Ma during the peak of the Trans-Hudson orogeny, returns to mid-paleolatitudes from similar to 1770 to similar to 1740 Ma, and then moves on to subequatorial paleolatitudes by similar to 1720 Ma.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JUL	2006	43	7					1071	1083		10.1139/E06-015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E06-015													WOS:000241582600016

While disturbance in the prehistoric period was found to be minimal and mainly activated by fire, the impact of land uses after European arrival initiated a change in the erosion and fire regime and brought new grazing animals and exotic plant species. These triggered temporal changes in eutrophication and the nature of erosion, and significant vegetation changes. There was a reduction in the stability and persistence of species representation, especially in herbfield vegetation, and little recovery is evident despite the cessation of summer grazing. It is apparent that the area is very sensitive to disturbance by human impact and large fires.																			0004-9182	1465-3311				MAY	1994	25	1					77	87		10.1080/00049189408703100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049189408703100													WOS:A1994NU36000007

MICROBIALITES IN A HIGH-ALTITUDE ANDEAN LAKE: MULTIPLE CONTROLS ON CARBONATE PRECIPITATION AND LAMINA ACCRETION	PALAIOS												Microbialites comprise the mineralized record of early life on Earth and preserve a spectrum of fabrics that reflect complex physical, chemical, and biological interactions. The relatively rarity of microbialites in modern environments, however, challenges our interpretation of ancient structures. Here we report the occurrence of microbial mats, mineral precipitates, and oncoids in the Laguna Negra, a high-altitude hypersaline Andean lake in Catamarca Province, Argentina. Laguna Negra is a Ca-Na-Cl brine where abundant carbonate precipitation takes place. Extreme environmental conditions, including high UV radiation, elevated salinity, and temperature extremes, restrict multicellular life so that mineralization reflects a combination of local hydrologic conditions, lake geochemistry, and microbial activity. The resulting carbonates consist of micritic laminae, botryoidal cement fans, and isopachous cement laminae that are strikingly similar to those observed in Proterozoic stromatolites, providing insight into mechanisms of mineralization. Here, increased saturation with respect to carbonate minerals reflects mixing of spring-fed inlets and lake waters, favoring microbialite formation and preservation. This highlights the importance of hydrological mixing zones in microbialite formation and as taphonomic windows to record microbial activity. Recent discoveries of minerals related to evaporating playa-lake systems on Mars further highlights the potential of Laguna Negra to provide critical insight into biosignature preservation in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial settings.

A modelling investigation into lake-breeze development and convection triggering in the Nam Co Lake basin, Tibetan Plateau	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This paper uses the cloud resolving Active Tracer High-resolution Atmospheric Model coupled to the interactive surface model Hybrid in order to investigate the diurnal development of a lake-breeze system at the Nam Co Lake on the Tibetan Plateau. Simulations with several background wind speeds are conducted, and the interaction of the lake breeze with topography and background wind in triggering moist and deep convection is studied. The model is able to adequately simulate the systems most important dynamical features such as turbulent surface fluxes and the development of a lake breeze for the different wind conditions. We identify two different mechanisms for convection triggering that are dependent on the direction of the background wind: triggering over topography, when the background wind and the lake breeze have the same flow direction, and triggering due to convergence between the lake-breeze front and the background wind. Our research also suggests that precipitation measurements at the centre of the basins on the Tibetan Plateau are not representative for the basin as a whole as precipitation is expected to occur mainly in the vicinity of the topography.

Historic and Contemporary Mercury Exposure and Potential Risk to Yellow-billed Loons (Gavia adamsii) Breeding in Alaska and Canada	WATERBIRDS												The Yellow-billed Loon (Gavia adamsii) is one of the rarest breeding birds in North America. Because of the small population size and patchy distribution, any stressor to its population is of concern. To determine risks posed by environmental mercury (Hg) loads, we captured 115 Yellow-billed Loons between 2002 and 2012 in the North American Arctic and sampled their blood and/or feather tissues and collected nine eggs. Museum samples from Yellow-billed Loons also were analyzed to examine potential changes in Hg exposure over time. An extensive database of published Hg concentrations and associated adverse effects in Common Loons (G. immer) is highly informative and representative for Yellow-billed Loons. Blood Hg concentrations reflect dietary uptake of methylmercury (MeHg) from breeding areas and are generally considered near background levels if less than 1.0 mu g/g wet weight (ww). Feather (grown at wintering sites) and egg Hg concentrations can represent a mix of breeding and wintering dietary uptake of MeHg. Based on Common Loon studies, significant risk of reduced reproductive success generally occurs when adult Hg concentrations exceed 2.0 mu g/g ww in blood, 20.0 mu g/g fresh weight (fw) in flight feathers and 1.0 mu g/g ww in eggs. Contemporary mercury concentrations for 176 total samples (across all study sites for 115 Yellow-billed Loons) ranged from 0.08 to 1.45 mu g/g ww in blood, 3.0 to 24.9 mu g/g fw in feathers and 0.21 to 1.23 mu g/g ww in eggs. Mercury concentrations in blood, feather and egg tissues indicate that some individual Yellow-billed Loons in breeding populations across North America are at risk of lowered productivity resulting from Hg exposure. Most Yellow-billed Loons breeding in Alaska overwinter in marine waters of eastern Asia. Although blood Hg concentrations from most breeding loons in Alaska are within background levels, some individuals exhibit elevated feather and egg Hg concentrations, which likely indicate the uptake of MeHg originating from eastern Asia. Feather Hg concentrations tended to be highest in individuals overwintering farthest west (closer to Asia). A retrospective analysis of museum specimens (n=25) found a two-fold increase in Yellow-billed Loon feather Hg concentrations from the pre-1920s (as early as 1845) to the present. The projected increase in Hg deposition (approximately four-fold by 2050) along with the uncertainty of Hg being released through the thawing of permafrost and Arctic sea ice suggest that Hg body burdens in Yellow-billed Loons may increase. These findings indicate that Hg is a current and potentially increasing environmental stressor for the Yellow-billed Loon and possibly other Nearctic-Palearctic migrant birds.					; Uher-Koch, Brian/AAC-8538-2020	Perkins, Marie/0000-0002-2101-6234; Basu, Niladri/0000-0002-2695-1037; 													1524-4695	1938-5390				APR	2014	37				1		147	159		10.1675/063.037.sp117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.037.sp117													WOS:000335613500017

The long-term studies showed that five parameters were significantly lower in the MD region than in the PD region: photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d(PAR)), concentrations of total suspended matter (C-TSM), tripton (C-Tripton), and phytoplankton pigment (CChla+Pa), and CDOM absorption coefficient (a(CDOM)(350)). In winter in the MD region, with only scarce submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) coverage, the K-d(PAR), C-TSM, and C-Tripton were significantly higher than in the PD region with no SAV; in contrast, CChla+Pa and a(CDOM)(350) were significantly lower in the MD region than in the PD region. In the other three seasons with high SAV coverage, K-d(PAR), C-TSM, C-Tripton, CChla+Pa, and a(CDOM)(350) were all significantly lower in the MD region than in the PD region. The appearance and growth of SAV decreased C-TSM, C-Tripton, and K-d(PAR). The short-term high-frequency study showed that phytoplankton and tripton absorption coefficients were significantly lower in the MD region than in the PD region. In the PD region, there were highly significant exponential relationships between wind speed, wave height, and wave shear stress, and C-Tripton and K-d(PAR), showing that wind-driven sediment resuspension could significantly affect both the tripton concentration and PAR attenuation. However, in the MD region, there were only weakly significant correlations, or no significant correlations, between wind speed, wave height, and wave shear stress, and C-Tripton, and K-d(PAR). The combination of the long-term site-specific and short-term high-frequency observations is an excellent tool for study of the bio-optical properties in lake environments.

Helicopter rescue and prehospital care for drowning children: two summer season case studies	MINERVA ANESTESIOLOGICA												Background. Drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death in children <14 years of age and is one of the most important causes of accidental injury between the ages of 1 and 4 years. In this study, the characteristics of non-fatal unintentional drownings in a small series of pediatric victims were examined. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed data collected by the rescue team form May to October in two consecutive years (2006, 2007). Results. Nine accidents occured in public waters, while 5 occured in lakes and rivers. The submersion time reported ranged from approximately 5 to 15 min. The ground emergency service with basic life support rescue experts intervented within a mean of 12 min. The ground emergency service with basic life support rescue experts intervented within a mean of 12 min. Advanced cardiac life support maneuvers were implemented by the helicopter medical crew for all victims. Ten of the 14 children remained in cardiocirculatory arrest despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was <8 in all cases. Field resuscitation ultimately proved successful for every child. Thus, none was transported by the helicopter with ongoing CPR. All submersion-injured children survived. No postanoxic cerebral injury or major neurological complications were detected. Conclusion. Assuring safe tracheal ventilation, achieving intravenous access, and stabilizing both respiratory and hemodynamic disturbances on the ground before transferring the patient are the keys to out-of-hospital management. Our 100% survival rare likely results from adequate primary out of-hospital care. Promptly dispatching a helicopter with a specialized medical crew is very expensive, but is worth the cost because it offers a better chance of survival.																			0375-9393					DEC	2008	74	12					703	707											18946432					WOS:000261380000005

This study aims to systematically analyze the characteristics of the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data of geothermal, river, and lake waters to understand the circulation of groundwater and to uncover the mechanism of geothermal formation in the Tibetan Plateau. Field observations and isotopic data show that geothermal water has higher temperatures and hydraulic pressures, as well as more depleted D and O-18 isotopic compositions than river and lake waters. Thus, neither lakes nor those larger river waters are the recharge source of geothermal water. Snow-melt water in high mountains can vertically infiltrate and deeply circulate along some stretching tensile active tectonic belts or sutures and recharge geothermal water. After deep circulation, cold surface water evolves into high-temperature thermal water and is then discharged as springs at the surface again in a low area, under high water-head difference and cold-hot water density difference. Therefore, the large-scale, high-temperature, high-hydraulic- pressure geothermal systems in the Tibetan Plateau are developed and maintained by rapid groundwater circulation and the heat source of upwelled residual magmatic water. Inevitably, the amount of geothermal water will increase if global warming accelerates the melting of glaciers in high mountains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Allen; Gerik, Thomas J.; Harman, Wyatte L.; Williams, Jimmy R.; Magre, Melanie			EPIC Evaluation of the Impact of Poultry Litter Application Timing on Nutrient Losses	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Recently, changes in the utilization practices of animal manures for fertilization have been encouraged to reduce the potential of nonpoint pollution of lakes and streams from agricultural land. However, the potential impact of changing some of these practices has not been fully studied. The objective of this study was to examine the potential impact of limiting poultry litter application times on nutrient movement important to water quality. The WinEPIC model was used to simulate poultry litter applications during the winter months and chemical fertilizer application, with both cool season and warm season grass pastures on the major soil regions of Alabama. With the warm season grass, soluble nitrogen (N) losses could be reduced if the application of poultry litter was made after 30 December. With the cool season grasses, there was no significant difference in application dates for poultry litter for soluble N losses for any soil region, and no improvement could be noted for limiting applications in northern Alabama compared to southern Alabama. No significant difference was observed for soluble phosphorus (P) losses for application date for either warm season or cool season grass pastures. This indicates that factors other than plant P uptake during the growing season were the dominant regulators of the amount of soluble P lost in runoff. Also, the results would indicate that best management practices such as are administered with the P index are more important than plant growth factors in determining N and P losses to the environment.

A stationary impulse-radar system for autonomous deployment in cold and temperate environments	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Stationary ice-penetrating radar (sIPR) systems can be used to monitor temporal changes in electromagnetically sensitive properties of glaciers and ice sheets. We describe a system intended for autonomous operation in remote glacial environments, and document its performance during deployments in cold and temperate settings. The design is patterned after an existing impulse radar system, with the addition of a fibre-optic link and timing module to control transmitter pulses, a micro-UPS (uninterruptable power supply) to prevent uncontrolled system shutdown and a customized satellite telemetry scheme. Various implementations of the sIPR were deployed on the Kaskawulsh Glacier near an ice-marginal lake in Yukon, Canada, for 44-77 days in summers 2014, 2015 and 2017. Pronounced perturbations to englacial radiostratigraphy were observed commensurate with lake filling and drainage, and are interpreted as changes in englacial water storage. Another sIPR was deployed in 2015-2016 on ice island PII-A-1-f, which originated from the Petermann Glacier in northwest Greenland. This system operated autonomously for almost a year during which changes in thickness of the ice column were clearly detected.

The present study was performed to measure water quality variables, primary productivity, chl-a and biomass of toxin producing algal species and fish production. High nutrient influx and toxin producing algal species have been observed during June 1999 to May 2000 in two water bodies [Girija Kund (A) and Maqubara pond (B)] of Faizabad The maximum chl-a concentration, toxins producing algal species biomass were found to be 415.00 and 515.00 in pond A, while 451.00 mug/l and 541.22 mg/l in pond B, respectively in the case of Microcystis aeruginosa. Ecological parameters to evaluate GPP, NPP and CR were found to be 297.00, 134.000 and 182.00 mgCm3/h in summer season in pond B, respectively which is higher than pond A.

However, wetland cover types have changed dynamically and have attracted the attention of society and researchers over the past few decades. To obtain detailed knowledge and understanding of the long-term landcover dynamics of Poyang Lake and the associated driving forces, Landsat and HJ-1A/B images (31 images) were used to acquire classification and frequency maps of Poyang Lake in the dry season from 1973-2019 based on the random forest (RF) algorithm. In addition, the driving forces were discussed according to the Geodetector model. The results showed that the coverage of water and mudflat showed opposite trends from 1987-2019. Water and vegetation exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 1981-2003 and from 1996-2004 (p < 0.01), respectively. A phenomenon of vegetation expanding from west to east was found, and the expansion areas were mainly concentrated in the central zone of Poyang Lake, while vegetation in the northern mountainous area of Songmen (region 1) and eastern Songmen Mountain (region 2), showed a significantly expanded trend (R-2 > 0.6, p < 0.01) during the five-decade period. The year-long dominant distribution of water occurred mainly in the two deltas formed by the Raohe and Tongjin rivers and the Fuhe and Xinjiang rivers, with deep water. In the 1973-2003 and 2003-2019 periods, a total of 313.522 km(2) of water turned into swamp and mudflat and 478.453 km(2) of swamp and mudflat transitioned into vegetation, respectively. Elevation and temperature appeared to be the main factors affecting the regional wetland evolution in the dry season and should be considered in the management of Poyang Lake. The findings of this work provide detailed information for spatial-temporal landcover changes of Poyang Lake, which could help policymakers to formulate scientific and appropriate policies and achieve restoration of the Poyang Lake wetland.					; Zhang, Lifu/L-5976-2013	Wang, Sa/0000-0003-0451-7181; zhang, li fu/0000-0002-3533-9966; 														2072-4292				MAY	2020	12	10							1595	10.3390/rs12101595	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12101595													WOS:000543394800062
J	Gist, DH; Miller, MC; Brence, WA				Gist, DH; Miller, MC; Brence, WA			Annual reproductive cycle of the zebra mussel in the Ohio River: A comparison with Lake Erie	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In order to evaluate the effect of temperature and trophy on zebra mussel reproduction, the annual reproductive cycle of Dreissena polymorpha was determined by histological examination of the gonads. Populations from Lake Erie, its tributaries, and the Ohio River were compared since they varied systematically in these parameters. The timing of gonadal changes in Lake Erie mussels and that of its eutrophic tributaries were identical. Gonadal development commenced overwinter. By August, spawning had commenced and ovarian tubules contained oocytes of varying stages and sizes, males possessed fully developed testes, and mature sperm were evident. Mussels from Lake Erie spawned only once during a season but approximately 30 % of mussels from Lake Erie tributaries (Sandusky Bay, Huron River, Old Woman Creek) had an additional spawn. By October, the gonads of all mussels were regressed and empty, and it was difficult to determine sex histologically. In contrast, complete gonadal regression was not seen in the Ohio River population. Some females contained yolked oocytes throughout the year, and some males possessed spermatids during the winter months. Females were generally gravid from May through September although there was considerable variation among individuals at any point in the year. Spawning in the river populations was estimated to occur from March through September. Evidence of two sets per year was observed in the middle Ohio River mussels. Temperature appeared to regulate the onset of major reproductive events, but food must have played a role in determining the frequency of reproduction.																			0003-9136					JAN	1997	138	3					365	379																WOS:A1997WJ94300005

The influence of invasive aquatic plant removal on diets of bluegill in Minnesota lakes	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Invasive aquatic plants in U.S. lakes and reservoirs frequently require managers to implement plant control, yet little is known about how these management efforts alter habitat available to adult fish. We used a before-after, control-impact (BACI) design to study four Minnesota lakes (two treated lakes and two untreated control lakes) to evaluate the influence of plant management using herbicides (i.e., endothall/2,4-D) on diets of adult bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque) over the course of 4 yr. We hypothesized that removing plants would result in an immediate increase of prey items available to bluegill reflected in an increase in total items in the bluegill diet, and that an increase in prey items would affect diet breadth. Invasive Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum L., was eliminated following herbicide treatment; however, native plants immediately expanded and plant overall abundance in the littoral zone was not reduced. We found no significant treatment effects on number of prey items per stomach, stomach content mass, diet composition, or abundance of major diet groups. However, we found that diet breadth increased posttreatment in the fall season, as evidenced by a more even distribution of bluegill diet items in stomach contents. Bluegill diet composition varied across years and lakes (primarily due to changes in Cladocera), but not due to treatment. We concluded that early seasonal application of herbicides resulted in an immediate shift from invasive aquatic plants to a diverse native community, which had minor effects on diets of bluegill.

J	Johnson, LE; Ricciardi, A; Carlton, JT				Johnson, LE; Ricciardi, A; Carlton, JT			Overland dispersal of aquatic invasive species: A risk assessment of transient recreational boating	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Predictions of the geographic spread of introduced species are often limited by a lack of data on their mechanisms of dispersal. We interviewed boaters and inspected boating equipment at public boat launches on Lake St. Clair (Michigan, USA) to assess the potential for the zebra mussel, an invasive bivalve, to be dispersed overland to inland waters by transient recreational boating activities. Several mechanisms associated with recreational boating were found to be capable of transporting either larval or adult life stages. Larvae were found in all forms of water carried by boats (i.e., in live wells, bilges, bait buckets, and engines) but were estimated to be 40-100x more abundant in live wells than other locations. Dilution in receiving waters should. however, greatly reduce the risk of establishing new populations by the introduction of larvae. Contrary to common belief, mussel dispersal from these boat launches did not occur by direct attachment to transient boats. Rather. adult and juvenile mussels were transported primarily on macrophytes entangled on boat trailers and, less frequently, on anchors (5.3% and 0.9% of departing boats, respectively). Combining these data with estimates of survival in air and reported boater destinations, we predict that a maximum of 0.12% of the trailered boats departing these access sites delivered live adult mussels to inland waters solely by transport on entangled macrophytes. While this is a small probability, high levels of vector activity resulted in a prediction of a total of 170 dispersal events to inland waters within the summer season from the primary boat launch studied. Many other potential vectors remain to be assessed, but the dispersal of zebra mussels by trailered boats, particularly by "piggybacking" on macrophytes entangled on the trailers, must be controlled in order to limit further range expansion of the zebra mussel within North America.

J	Merino, ER; Assine, ML				Merino, Eder Renato; Assine, Mario Luis			Hidden in plain sight: How finding a lake in the Brazilian Pantanal improves understanding of wetland hydrogeomorphology	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Wetlands are permanently or seasonally flooded areas which support countless species of plants and animals. The Pantanal, in central-west Brazil is one of the largest freshwater wetlands in the world covering an area of similar to 150 000 km(2). The relationships between geomorphology, hydrology, sedimentation, and vegetation cover are critical for understanding how the landscape constrains the dynamics of wetlands. We provide a detailed study of the geomorphology and surface hydrology of the Negro River Interfan System (NRIS), in the southern Pantanal, by applying multiple approaches (i.e. remote sensing analysis, geomorphological zonation and hydrosedimentological surveys). A multitemporal analysis of Landsat imagery produced an inundation frequency map (2000-2011 period) that revealed a permanently flooded area in the central portion of the NRIS. A hidden fluvial lake was previously undetected due to the accumulation of floating mats and floating meadows of macrophytes. The Negro and Aquidauana feeder rivers exhibit remarkable differences in channel planform, water discharge, and sediment load. The Negro River presents a distributary pattern with marginal levees with decreasing elevation as it progrades into the lake and remains as a subaqueous landform conditioning the water flow downstream. The lake outflow to the Paraguay River occurs mainly by sheet flow during flood seasons and through small tributary channels during dry months. The lake's geometry is outlined by east-northeast and west-northwest straight borders, suggesting that the area is tectonically controlled. A cloud-based worldwide water surface database (1984-2015) revealed frequent channel changes within the NRIS. Recent channel avulsions in the lower course of the Negro River are noteworthy mainly because the former river channel at the confluence with the Paraguay River is no longer connected with the Negro River channel.

The results showed that, in sediments, pH increased and Eh decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in the first three weeks. The variation of sulfate reduction bacteria (SRB) amount increased initially and then fell, and had direct relation with sulfate concentration in the pore water. High sulfate concentrations led to a significant increase in total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (p < 0.01) of the overlying water and pore water except for TP concentration of the pore water. TP and labile organic phosphorus (LOP) in sediments decreased significantly compared with the control (P < 0.05) though no significant difference was found in the other forms of phosphorus.

Strain TL1 was identified as Achromobacter sp. based on its biophysical and biochemical properties and the analysis of its 16S rRNA sequence. Microcystis aeruginosa, which is the most common toxic cyanobacterium in eutrophic freshwater, could be decomposed by strain TL1. The results showed that after inoculation with the algalytic bacterium, the content of chlorophyll-a, maximum PSII quantum yield, and maximum electron transport rates of the alga decreased sharply. At first, the algal cells enhanced the activities of some antioxidative enzymes, but subsequently, the activities of antioxidative enzymes fell sharply once damage of the algal cells was achieved. The filtrate from strain TL1 culture suspension, after autoclaving and treatments with proteinase K, strongly inhibited algal growth, indicating that the lytic metabolites were extracellular and thermostable, not a protein.

Dramatic Improvements in Beach Water Quality Following Gull Removal	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Gulls are often cited as important contributors of fecal contamination to surface waters, and some recreational beaches have used gull control measures to improve microbial water quality. In this study, gulls were chased from a Lake Michigan beach using specially trained dogs, and water quality improvements were quantified. Fecal indicator bacteria and potentially pathogenic bacteria were measured before and during gull control using culture methods and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Harassment by dogs was an effective method of gull control: average daily gull populations fell from 665 before to 17 during intervention; and a significant reduction in the density of a gull-associated marker was observed (p < 0.001). Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli densities were also significantly reduced during gull control (p < 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively for culture methods; p = 0.012 and p = 0.034, respectively for qPCR). Linear regression results indicate that a 50% reduction in gulls was associated with a 38% and 29% decrease in Enterococcus spp. and E. coli densities, respectively. Potentially human pathogenic bacteria were detected on 64% of days prior to gull control and absent during gull intervention, a significant reduction (p = 0.005). This study demonstrates that gull removal can be a highly successful beach remedial action to improve microbial water quality.

In the fall of 1998, the plant will begin receiving water from Lake Texana, a source with very different water quality. A comprehensive treatability study was conducted to prepare the plant for the new water. In evaluating the desirability of treating a given blend and selecting an optimum blend to target for treatment, the authors considered several factors, e.g., amount of chemicals required, range in chemical dosages required, settled and filtered water quality, and compliance with the proposed enhanced coagulation regulations. The authors proposed that the optimal blend for Corpus Christi be identified by alkalinity and achieved by targeting a range of alkalinity in the raw water. In general, selection of a blend based on a target source water parameter may result in creation of a more consistent source water than is achievable by blending based on quantity alone, thereby increasing the potential for optimizing plant performance.																			0003-150X					AUG	1998	90	8					40	49																WOS:000075392800012

The present study analyzed the daily travel distance, home range and group characteristics of scaly-sided merganser Mergus squamatus in Yihuang and Wuyuan counties, Jiangxi Province, China, from December 2012 to March 2013 and December 2015 to March 2016. Results showed that the daily travel distance of scaly-sided merganser was 3100 +/- 1313 m; the daily home range was 122,460 +/- 42,019 m(2); and the overall home range was 202,350 m(2) during the wintering period. No significant difference was detected in the daily travel distance between different months (F = 0.658, P> 0.05). Significant differences were detected in the daily home rang between January and February, and between February and March. No significant correlation was observed between daily travel distance and home range (R = 0.256, n = 12, P > 0.05). The significant correlation between daily home range and daily minimum temperature may be related to energy requirements or prey activities. The average group size of the scaly-sided merganser was 3.91 +/- 2.94 individuals, and extremely significant differences existed at different time of day (F = 25.540, df = 11, P < 0.01). The largest group size (5.22 +/- 5 individuals) appeared at 16:00-17:00, and the smallest at 08:00-09:00 (2.6 +/- 1.12 individuals), similar results obtained between December 2015 and March 2016, which was related to the daily habits of this species, such as dispersed foraging, collective maintenance and rest. Group size peaked in February (5.07 +/- 4.166 individuals) and was smallest (2.91 +/- 1.354 individuals) in December with significantly different group sizes in all months (F = 35.351, df = 3, P < 0.01). A total of 57.98% of all groups had a majority of females. A large difference in sex ratios was observed among different months. The actual ratio of [(adult + sub-adult male): (adult + sub-adult female)] was 1:1.44 (n = 22) in February. Future studies are necessary, and the main goal should be focused on sex ratio, mortality and sex ratio at birth.																			0030-9923					JUN	2017	49	3					1005	1011		10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.3.1005.1011	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.3.1005.1011													WOS:000409565700032

Its detailed morphometric characters based on LM and SEM studies were described herein. The organism is oval in shape and thickly ciliated. The vestibulum is "V" shaped and occupies about 1/3 to 2/5 of the body length. The vestibular and nearby regions possess strong peripheral fibers which form a marked axial fiber about the cytopharynx. More than 10 contractile vacuoles are distributed along the periphery of the latter body. Comparisions were made between this new species and B. sinensis Nie, 1935. They were discriminated from each other in terms of general body forms, body size, and vestibulum shapes. Besides, special attention was paid to its high-speed daughter swarmers which we believed to be the infective stage of B. honghuensis.

The structure and dynamics of ichthyoplankton assemblages can tell us much about biodiversity and fish population dynamics, but are poorly understood in nearshore areas of the Great Lakes, where most spawning and nursery habitats exist. Ichthyoplankton samples were collected with a neuston net in waters 2-13 m deep weekly or biweekly from mid-April through August, during 3 years (2000-2002) as part of a study of fish assemblages in west-central Lake Erie. A suite of abiotic variables was simultaneously measured to characterize habitat. Cluster and ordination analyses revealed several distinct ichthyoplankton assemblages that changed seasonally. A lake whilefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) dominated assemblage appeared first in April. In May, assemblages were dominated by several percid species. Summer assemblages were overwhelmingly dominated by emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), with large gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) components. This seasonal trend in species assemblages was also associated with increasing temperature and water clarity. Water depth and drift processes may also play a role in structuring these assemblages. The most common and widely distributed assemblages were not associated with substratum type, which we characterized as either hard or soft. The timing of hatch and larval growth separated the major groups in time and may have adaptive significance for the members of each major assemblage. The quality and locations (with reference to lake circulation) of spawning and nursery grounds may determine larval success and affect year class strength.

Size variation in Tachyoryctes splendens (East African mole-rat) and its implications for late Quaternary temperature change in equatorial East Africa	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This study develops a new proxy for Quaternary temperature change in tropical Africa through analysis of size variation in East African mole-rat (Tachyoryctes splendens). In modern mole-rats, mandibular alveolar length is unrelated to annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, temperature seasonality, or primary productivity. However, it is inversely correlated with mean annual temperature, in agreement with Bergmann's rule. This relationship is observed at temperatures below similar to 17.3 degrees C, but not at higher temperatures. We apply these observations to late Quaternary mole-rats from Wakondo (similar to 100 ka) and Kisaaka (similar to 50 ka) in the Lake Victoria region and Enkapune ya Muto (EYM;similar to 7.2-3.2 ka) in Kenya's central rift. The Lake Victoria mole-rats are larger than expected for populations from warm climates typical of the area today, implying cooler temperatures in the past. The magnitude of temperature decline needed to drive the size shift is substantial (similar to 4-6 degrees C), similar in magnitude to the degree of change between the Last Glacial Maximum and Holocene, but is consistent with regional temperature records and with scenarios linking equatorial African temperature to northern hemisphere summer insolation. Size changes through time at EYM indicate that rising temperatures during the middle Holocene accompanied and potentially contributed to a decline in Lake Naivasha and expansion of grassland vegetation.

J	Yue, B; Chamberland, J; Mulvie, J				Yue, Bing; Chamberland, Joseph; Mulvie, John			Bottom-fast ice delineation with PolSAR and InSAR techniques in the Mackenzie Delta region, Northwest Territories, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Bottom-fast ice (BFI) refers to sea or lake ice that freezes to the sea or lake bed. The formation of BFI plays an important role in the Mackenzie Delta Region's seasonal environmental changes. This study involves examining the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for delineating BFI from floating ice on a study site within the coastal region of the Mackenzie Delta. The ultimate aim is to establish robust BFI monitoring tools using SAR data processing techniques. BFI detection methodologies based on polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image classification and interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence segmentation have been examined using RADARSAT-2 data. Polarimetric analysis can use individual SAR images and is not susceptible to decorrelation factors such as weather events. By using these analysis techniques it is thus possible to delineate BFI extent throughout the winter. A limitation of these techniques is the sensitivity to the water and consequently the ice saline content. The polarimetric decompositions and classifications for delineation of BFI apply only to areas where the water has a low saline concentration. Conversely, InSAR methods for BFI delineation require interferometric datasets with high temporal coherence. The results of the interferometric datasets can eliminate false alarms in BFI maps caused by similar backscattered SAR signal from floating ice with varying degrees of salinity. The delineation results using both methods were analyzed and compared. It was found that though each method is able to detect and delineate BFI on its own, reliable and more accurate results occur when the two methods are combined, as the reliance on different phenomena allow for false alarm identification.																			0703-8992	1712-7971				AUG	2013	39	4					341	353		10.5589/m13-042	http://dx.doi.org/10.5589/m13-042													WOS:000328375100007

Expansion of the North American amphipod Gammarus tigrinus Sexton, 1939 to the Neva Estuary (easternmost Baltic Sea)	OCEANOLOGIA												The North American gammaridean amphipod, Gammarus tigrinus, was found in the easternmost part of the Baltic Sea (Neva Estuary) near a new oil terminal. This species may well have been transported to the Neva Estuary with ballast waters from the Finnish area of the Gulf of Finland, where it was recorded recently. In 2005, the mid-summer density of G. tigrinus was 27 indiv. m(-2). By 2006 this species had spread 100 km to the east from the first site, colonizing the northern coastal zone of the estuary. Its density reached 99-126 indiv. m(-2). Fecund females and juveniles contributed about 50% to the entire population density, which testifies to the successful reproduction and establishment of G. tigrinus in the Neva Estuary. There is a high risk of further expansions of G. tigrinus from the new area to the various lakes of Eastern Europe via inland canal-river systems, which may lead to unforeseeable changes in aquatic communities.

Samples were analysed for major components, and for heavy metals at ultra-trace levels. The sample sites included biologically active ponds, glacier melt water, lake water, roadside drains, and rivers. Sample salinities varied widely, but heavy-metal concentrations were uniformly low except where significant human impacts would have been expected. Concentrations of silver, mercury, lead, copper, cadmium, chromium, nickel, and zinc were higher at Scott Base than in the other areas and were dominantly associated with coarse particulates. Natural sources of metals may be local lithology, but chemical and mechanical processes within the soils and solutions affect the distributions of different metals.																			0028-8330					SEP	1997	31	3					313	325		10.1080/00288330.1997.9516769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1997.9516769													WOS:A1997YA25200003

Alaskan brown bears (Ursus arctos) aggregate and display fidelity to foraging neighborhoods while preying on Pacific salmon along small streams	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The interaction between brown bears (Ursus arctos) and Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) is important to the population dynamics of both species and a celebrated example of consumer-mediated nutrient transport. Yet, much of the site-specific information we have about the bears in this relationship comes from observations at a few highly visible but unrepresentative locations and a small number of radio-telemetry studies. Consequently, our understanding of brown bear abundance and behavior at more cryptic locations where they commonly feed on salmon, including small spawning streams, remains limited. We employed a noninvasive genetic approach (barbed wire hair snares) over four summers (2012-2015) to document patterns of brown bear abundance and movement among six spawning streams for sockeye salmon, O.nerka, in southwestern Alaska. The streams were grouped into two trios on opposite sides of Lake Aleknagik. Thus, we predicted that most bears would forage within only one trio during the spawning season because of the energetic costs associated with swimming between them or traveling around the lake and show fidelity to particular trios across years because of the benefits of familiarity with local salmon dynamics and stream characteristics. Huggins closed-capture models based on encounter histories from genotyped hair samples revealed that as many as 41 individuals visited single streams during the annual 6-week sampling season. Bears also moved freely among trios of streams but rarely moved between these putative foraging neighborhoods, either during or between years. By implication, even small salmon spawning streams can serve as important resources for brown bears, and consistent use of stream neighborhoods by certain bears may play an important role in spatially structuring coastal bear populations. Our findings also underscore the efficacy of noninvasive hair snagging and genetic analysis for examining bear abundance and movements at relatively fine spatial and temporal scales.

Stream nutrient limitation and sediment interactions in the Eucha-Spavinaw Basin	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Water-quality concerns at lakes and reservoirs often force watershed managers to focus on nutrient sources within the catchment, particularly nutrients applied to the landscape and direct input of nutrients from wastewater treatment plants. When nutrients from these sources enter stream systems, nutrient molecules begin a spiraling process, moving downstream and interacting in various in-stream processes that temporarily retain and transform nutrients. The objectives of this study were to evaluate: 1) the limiting nutrient of periphytic algae using a passive diffusion periphytometer; 2) the content of easily exchangeable and bioavailable nutrients in sediments; and 3) sediment and water column dissolved phosphorus equilibrium in streams draining the Eucha-Spavinaw Basin in northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas. Stream nutrient concentrations were generally not limiting algal growth because nutrient enrichment did not elicit a significant increase in periphytic chlorophyll-a concentration at most locations and in most seasons; however, two streams did show evidence of P limitation of algal growth during summer. Nutrient concentrations in the select Ozark streams increased with an increase in pasture land use in the catchment (p<0.05). Sediment nutrient content and equilibrium P concentrations generally also increased with the proportion of pasture, but these parameters were more strongly influenced by wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge than catchment land use. In the Ozarks, it appears that the effects of wastewater treatment plants on stream water chemistry and sediment nutrient content were much greater than that from potential nonpoint sources and catchment land use.

The drought that affected Israel between 1998 and 2001 was of unusual climatic and hydrologic severity; the most serious in the last 125 years in northern Israel. The climatic drought affected the water flow of the Jordan River and the level of Lake Kinneret, which fell to -214(.)90 m (below sea-level), the lowest lake level in historical periods. The annual flow of the Jordan River in the drought period was the lowest in the 50-year hydrological record. Human interference, water pumping and flow diversion, exacerbated the negative drought impact, causing land degradation such as the drying of wetlands and salinization of freshwater aquifers. The failure to introduce drought contingency planning and sustainable water resources management has so far affected agriculture and nature conservation. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Stone, DM				Stone, DM			Logging options to minimize soil disturbance in the northern Lake States	NORTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY												Forest harvesting is likely to have greater impacts on site productivity than any other activity during the rotation. We determined effects of commercial, winter-logging of four aspen-dominated stands on site disturbance and development of regeneration on clay soils in western Upper Michigan. A large skidder caused deep rutting on 20% of a site in a thinning that removed 7.8 m(2) ha(-1) (34 ft(2) ac(-1)) of basal area, and on 38% of a clearcut site. After the first growing season, 45% of the clearcut had no aspen regeneration, and 82% had less than the recommended minimum of 15,000 (15 k) suckers ha(-1) (6 k ac(-1)). Options that can be utilized to minimize logging impacts include: (1) excluding riparian areas and poorly drained inclusions from cutting units; (2) dry season harvesting; (3) plowing snow from (or packing the snow on) skid trails and landings, permitting them to freeze; (4) felling with delayed skidding until trails and landings have frozen; and (5) application of best management practices (BMP) recommendations such as progressive (back-to-front) harvesting. Each of these should have minimal effects on logging costs and may be economically advantageous. As an interim guide, a minimum of 7.5 cm (3.0 in.) of soil frost is recommended for small equipment and 15 cm (6.0 in.) for large equipment. BMP guides could be effective in communicating management objectives to foresters, sale administrators, contractors, and operators, increasing their awareness of (and sensitivity toward) soil disturbance and thus, contribute to sustaining future productivity.																			0742-6348	1938-3762				SEP	2002	19	3					115	121		10.1093/njaf/19.3.115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/njaf/19.3.115													WOS:000177868600003

Spatial patterns, trends, and the potential long-term impacts of tree harvesting on lake calcium levels in the Muskoka River Watershed, Ontario, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The issue of calcium (Ca) decline in surface waters of eastern Canada is an emerging concern that may be made worse by timber harvesting. In the Muskoka River Watershed (MRW) in Ontario, the mean lake Ca concentration in 104 lakes decreased by 30% since the 1980s, with the rate of decrease slowing over time consistent with changes in lake sulfate (SO4) as the region recovers from acid deposition. Recent data suggested that smaller lakes, at higher elevation, in smaller catchments with higher runoff that are minimally impacted by the influence of roads and agriculture are associated with lower Ca concentrations and thus are the lakes most at risk of amplified Ca depletion. Using proposed annual allowable harvest cuts from 10-year forest management plans, 38% of 364 lakes assessed in the MRW will fall below a reported critical 1 mg.L-1 Ca threshold compared with just 8% in the absence of future harvesting. It is concluded that Ca decline poses a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems and should be taken into consideration in future forest management plans.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2016	73	3					382	393		10.1139/cjfas-2015-0231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-0231													WOS:000375423600006

The geopark has plenty of geoheritage resources, including the quaternary glacier landform, volcanic landscape, hot spring, desert, grassland, rivers, and lakes. It is famous owing to the geodiversity and biodiversity. The wetlands resources are rich and play an important role in maintaining the ecosystem and biodiversity. However, the monitoring and protection of wetlands are rarely reported. In this study, the remotely sensed data coupled with field survey and experimental data are used to systematically reveal the types, characteristics, and protection of the wetlands. The wetlands are classified into three types, i.e., lakes wetlands, river wetlands, meadow marshes, and swamps wetlands. In addition, the spatial distribution and mineral contents of various wetlands are analyzed. Finally, several protection suggestions are proposed. These results will be helpful to promote the management and protection of the wetlands.																			1746-4463		978-1-84564-829-9; 978-1-84564-828-2				2014	46						2521	2526		10.2495/ISME20133413	http://dx.doi.org/10.2495/ISME20133413													WOS:000346563503084

The Romanian Criminal Law stipulates that infringement of water sources and networks by any means, if harmful for people, animals or plants, is punished with prison from 6 months to 4 years or fine. The water sources that the law refers to are: springs, fountains, lakes and bowls. The water networks refer to pipes, filters, canals, cradles etc. The analysis of the infringement of water polluting is done according to the well-known doctrine structure and comprises: the infringement object and subject, the content of the infringement: the objective side of the material element, the immediate consequence and cause relation; the subjective side of the infringement as well as their means of realisation and the sanctions applicable.																			1314-2704						2012							1123	1126																WOS:000348536400151

It is known, however, that even mild environmental noise may induce large fluctuations in population abundances. This is due to a resonance effect that occurs in communities on the edge of stability. Here, we use a simple predator-prey model to explore the sensitivity of plankton communities to stochastic environmental fluctuations. Our results show that the magnitude of resonance depends on the timescale of intrinsic population dynamics relative to the characteristic timescale of the environmental fluctuations. Predator-prey communities with an intrinsic tendency to oscillate at a period T are particularly responsive to red noise characterized by a timescale of tau = T/2 pi. We compare these theoretical predictions with the timescales of temperature fluctuations measured in lakes and oceans. This reveals that plankton communities will be highly sensitive to natural temperature fluctuations. More specifically, we demonstrate that the relatively fast temperature fluctuations in shallow lakes fall largely within the range to which rotifers and cladocerans are most sensitive, while marine copepods and krill will tend to resonate more strongly with the slower temperature variability of the open ocean.

Ice and Snow on Lake Stemmevatnet, Spitsbergen, in Winter 2019/20	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The results of observations and modeling of the formation of the snow-ice cover of Lake Stemme (West Svalbard Island) in winter 2019/20 are presented. The main information was obtained by two radar (GPR) survey, performed on the floating ice of the Lake on March 12 and April 22 of 2020. Authors believe that probably these observations were the first ones on the Lake. The use of the radar made it possible to obtain data on the dynamics of the thickness of the layers of snow and ice cover, the so-called "snow ice" which is formed when the boundary between snow and ice was submerged under water. During the time between records, the thick-ness of the last "snow ice" increased two to three times, i.e., from units to the first tens of cm, and it spread to the entire deep-water part of the Lake area. In addition, analysis of high-precision positioning of the radar records revealed a significant deflection in the ice surface in the central part of the Lake under the influence of snow load and the decreasing level of the reservoir. The calculations of the thermodynamics of the floating ice cover have shown that its thickening occurs as a result of the processes of congelation and isostatic ice formation, replacing each other at its lower and upper boundaries, respectively. At the same time, the formation of "snow ice" violates the characteristic feature of decreasing of ice thickness with growth of the snow thick-ness, which significantly influences on the thermal and mass balance of the Lake snow-ice cover. Results of calculations of the ice cover deformation did show that it takes place not only due to the elastic, but also to the viscous properties of ice, and it is concentrated in a narrow coastal zone. The maximum radial stress is reached at a distance of several meters from the shore, where a circular crack parallel to the shoreline is formed. Such a crack is formed at all ice thicknesses at about the same distance from the shore.

J	Felip, M; Camarero, L; Catalan, J				Felip, M; Camarero, L; Catalan, J			Temporal changes of microbial assemblages in the ice and snow cover of a high mountain lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												It has recently been shown that a rich community of microorganisms inhabits the slush layers of the winter cover of high mountain lakes. In this study, temporal changes in species assemblages and environmental conditions in the ice and snow cover of Lake Redo in the Pyrenees (Spain) are presented. The winter cover was a highly dynamic environment, in which major changes occurred in physical structure and chemical characteristics. The biomass and species composition of the microbial groups present (autotrophic and heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, and bacteria) reflected these physicochemical alterations. After an initial phase, during which the ice sheet formed and the first snows accumulated with little or no development of slush layers, there were two stages of microbial assemblages, which coincided with the two main phases in the physical change of the cover: the growth period (from January to mid-April) and the ablation period (from mid-April to ice-out in June). Initially, microbial biomass originated from inputs of phytoplankton-rich (5.9 mu g chlorophyll a liter(-1)) surface lake water that flooded the cover as a result of the hydrostatic adjustment induced by the progressive accumulation of snow on top of the ice sheet. This was followed by a differential growth of mixotrophic or heterotrophic flagellated species, such as Ochromonas sp., Cryptomonas spp., Monosiga ovata and Oikomonas termo, which peaked at different times. Species depended primarily on bacterivory for their growth, since during this period, light did not reach the slush layers. By April, the transition from cover growth to ablation was marked by a reduction in biomass and in the number of species. During the ablation period, the rate of change of the cover was greater, and microbial assemblages were characterized by the vertical segregation and by the appearance of new species, some of which were typically nonplanktonic. During that time, the cover was highly influenced by the large amount of water from the melting of the snowpack within the catchment. This water Likely provided chemicals and organisms, while increased light availability allowed for the growth of algae (Pteromonas sp. and other volvocales) and of the associated food web in the upper slush. In deeper layers, however, a bacteria-based food web provided prey for large ciliates (Urosoma sp., Dileptus sp., and Lacrymaria sp.), probably carried from littoral or watershed soils.

The lakes are located in the northeastern region of European Russia. All lakes are separated into deep (with mean depth from 2.0 to 8.0 m) and shallow ones (mean depth is less than 1.5 m). Several lakes were low - or strongly polluted by crude oil. Concentrations of hydrocarbons in lake water were respectively 0.42-0.92 mg1(-1) and 7.4-6.3 mg 1(-1). Species composition, number and biomass of meiobenthos were investigated. Relationships between those parameters and environmental and trophic factors were analyzed. Meiobenthos biomass ranged from 0.003 to 0.911 g m(-2) in central zones of deep lakes and from 0.38 to 17.61 g m(-2) in littoral zones. The biomass of littoral Cladocera, Harpacticoida and Nematoda was higher in deep unpolluted mesotrophic lakes. The biomass of Bivalvia positively correlated with primary production of phytoplankton. Oil pollution caused structural changes of communities. Benthic Cladocera and Chironomidae are more vulnerable to the effect of oil pollution. They were only abundant at unpolluted and law-polluted localities of the lake bottom. Highest bionnass of meiobenthic Bivalvia occurred in low polluted lakes. Cyciopoida is the most resistant component of meiobenthos communities. Their abundance was highest at most polluted localities.

Three-dimensional exchange flows in a semi-enclosed bay: Numerical simulations and high frequency radar observations	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												In this work we present the exchange flows between a semi-enclosed Bay and the adjacent ocean as measured by a real-time coastal observing system in Baja California, Mexico. Several sources of information as numerical modeling, currents profile data, high frequency radar observations and drifters tracking, all together show an interesting three-dimensional structure to the exchange flows. The northern entrance (relatively shallow, - 40 m at its deepest portion) showed an estuarine-like exchange pattern, with a net outflow at the shallow parts and inflow at the deepest, suggesting that the frictional effect is more important than the earth's rotation, as typically observed in relatively small bodies of water like estuaries and coastal lagoons. On the other hand, the southern entrance (with a 400 m deep canyon) is more complex, with recurrent anticyclonic exchange pattern with inflows at the western limit and outflows at the east. We suggest that the vertical structure of this circulation may be sustained by the deep canyon which lowers the thermocline, but further investigation is needed.					; Marti, Clelia/H-5371-2014; Olache, Luis/AAB-6751-2019	Rodriguez-Padilla, Isaac/0000-0001-8782-7534; Navarro Olache, Luis F/0000-0002-2051-6560; Gonzalez Montes, Stephanie/0000-0002-3645-7630; Flores Vidal, Xavier/0000-0002-5891-5145													0272-7714	1096-0015				OCT 15	2018	210						26	35		10.1016/j.ecss.2018.05.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2018.05.027													WOS:000439740000004

Paleotopography of the continents was lower than originally thought, eliminating the 'cold continental interior paradox' of fossils of plants that could not tolerate freezing occurring in regions indicated by climate models to be well below freezing in winter. The controversy over the height of Cretaceous sea levels has been resolved by knowledge of the effects of passage of the subducted slab of the Farallon Plate beneath the North American crust. The cause of shorter term sea level changes of the order of 30 to 50 meters is not because of growth and decay of ice sheets, but more likely the filling and release of water from groundwater reservoirs and lakes although there may have been some ice in the Early and latest Cretaceous. Carbon dioxide was not the only significant greenhouse gas; methane contributed significantly to the warmer climate. Suggestions of very warm tropical ocean temperatures (> 40A degrees C) have implications for the nature of plant life on land limited by Rubisco activase. The land surfaces were much wetter than has been thought, with meandering rivers and many oxbow lakes providing habitat for large dinosaurs. A major rethinking of the nature of conditions on a warmer Earth is underway, and a new suite of paleoclimate simulations for the Cretaceous is needed.																			1674-7313	1869-1897				JAN	2017	60	1					5	19		10.1007/s11430-016-0095-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-016-0095-9													WOS:000392207400002

Compared with the Baltic ringed seal, and especially with the Saimaa seal, the population status of the Ladoga ringed seal is good. The population probably includes over 5000 animals. The body of the Ladoga seal is smaller than that of the Saimaa seal or the Baltic ringed seal; its pelage is darker and also craniometrically the Ladoga seal clearly differs from the other subspecies of ringed seal. During summer in Northern Ladoga, the Ladoga ringed seal forms haul-out herds of more than 50 animals. During haul-out in herds the Ladoga seal actively uses different vocalizations. Concentrations of mercury in the liver and kidney of the Ladoga seal are clearly elevated, but levels of the other environmental toxicants analyzed (Cd, Pb, PCB) are comparatively low.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 12	1996	322	1-3					193	198		10.1007/BF00031827	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031827													WOS:A1996UT84700031
J	Atkinson, SF; Mabe, JA				Atkinson, Samuel F.; Mabe, Jeff A.			Near real-time monitoring and mapping of specific conductivity levels across Lake Texoma, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A submersible sonde equipped with a specific conductivity probe, linked with a global positioning satellite receiver was developed, deployed on a small boat, and used to map spatial and temporal variations in specific conductivity in a large reservoir. 7,695 sample points were recorded during 8 sampling trips. Specific conductivity ranged from 442,uS/cm to 3,378,uS/cm over the nine-month study. The data showed five statistically different zones in the reservoir: 2 different riverine zones, 2 different riverine transition zones, and a lacustrine zone (the main lake zone). These data were imported to a geographic information system where they were spatially interpolated to generate 8 maps showing specific conductivity levels across the entire surface of the lake. The highly dynamic nature of water quality, due to the widely differing nature of the rivers that flow into the reservoir and the effect of large inflows of fresh water during winter storms is easily captured and visualized using this approach.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2006	120	1-3					449	460		10.1007/s10661-005-9072-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-005-9072-x								16741798					WOS:000239890400024

The contribution of lake benthic algae to the sediment record in a carbonate mountain lake influenced by marked natural water-level fluctuations	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Lake Tovel is an oligotrophic, meromictic, mountain lake of the Dolomites that undergoes marked seasonal water-level fluctuations (WLFs). We used neo- and paleolimnological data collected since 1999 to test the utility of algal and cyanobacterial pigments and diatom and chironomid biodiversity as proxies for WLF and to highlight the contribution of benthic algae to the sediment record. We found that detailed knowledge of present-day spatiotemporal patterns of WLF is essential for a complete and correct interpretation of paleolimnological data. Scytonemin, a cyanobacteria-specific photoprotective pigment, was produced by epilithic cyanobacteria in the depth zone affected by WLF and should be considered a proxy for the extent of WLF. The phytobenthos was as important as phytoplankton as a source of sedimentary pigments. We used information gained on the detailed distribution of diatoms at different depths and on different substrata in the 2 basins to show the probable location in the lake from which taxa in sediment cores originated to aid in interpretation of the sediment archive (including identification of periods of active hydrology). We sampled present-day chironomids in springs and streams feeding the lake and along a depth transect in the main basin. The taxa found were all rheophilic, crenophilous, or typical of the littoral zone of oligotrophic lakes. We interpreted sections of the cores containing large numbers of Orthocladiinae and Diamesinae head capsules as indicative of periods of active hydrology (including sudden and marked WLF) because the littoral taxa found in the cores must have been derived from the littoral zone by sediment focusing or slumps. Thus, we identified useful proxies of WLF in mountain, carbonate lakes.

J	Jin, KR; Sun, DT				Jin, Kang-Ren; Sun, Detong			Sediment resuspension and hydrodynamics in Lake Okeechobee during the late summer	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS												In this study, in order to better understand the mechanisms affecting sediment resuspension, extensive data sets were collected in September and October of 2002 including wind velocity, wave, current velocity, water temperature, total suspended solid, suspended sediment concentration, and total phosphorus. Analyses of these data indicate that waves are the dominant factors in sediment resuspension while wind-induced currents are the primary forces to transport suspended sediments. Surface and bottom currents frequently flow in opposite directions, forming a stratified water column. A time lag exists between currents near lake bottom and wind forcing at the surface. The diurnal thermal stratification occurs in the deep region of the lake. A time lag is also found between suspended sediment concentration and wind speed. The study provides valuable storm-event data and mechanism analyses, which can improve our understanding of the lake circulation, wave dynamics, and their impact on sediment resuspension and vertical mixing in Lake Okeechobee. The data resulting from this study will be used to validate the Lake Okeechobee Environment Model which is used to predict the impacts of different management scenarios on take activities.																			0733-9399	1943-7889				AUG	2007	133	8					899	910		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2007)133:8(899)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2007)133:8(899)													WOS:000248648600005
J	Arakelova, KS; Michel, E				Arakelova, Katherine S.; Michel, Ellinor			Physiological differences between coexisting congeneric species of snails in a subarctic lake	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												Quantitative measures of feeding, respiration, growth and reproduction were brought together to achieve an overview of differences in physiology between 2 sympatric species of Anisus (Gastropoda, Planorbidae) in subarctic Lake Krivoye, northwestern Russia. This is a resource-limited lake with a short summer growing season where one might expect intense competition for resources among the numerous snails. Because coexistence is a multidimensional process, we have aimed to quantify bioenergetic variables related to several different major physiological functions. Using experiments that manipulated detritus and periphyton, we showed that both species consume detritus in combination with algae, but used different feeding strategies. Anisus contortus has a steeper growth allometry, greater specific growth rate and faster reproductive cycle. Anisus acronicus, however, has a faster absolute growth rate and longer life cycle, which results in its dominance in biomass and numbers. Although bioenergetics in general cannot be used to test directly for competition between closely related species, we have shown alternative growth and energy-metabolism strategies used by different species in a common habitat. Indicators of niche partitioning, maintained by balance calculations, included differences in preferences, quality and consumption rate of consumed food, We expect that these differences are not only important in proximal coexistence, but may also present alternatives for surviving long-term changes in the lake's productivity and habitat types.																			1864-7790	1864-7782					2009	5	3					209	217		10.3354/ab00150	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ab00150													WOS:000267411800001
J	Konstantinov, EA				Konstantinov, E. A.			A New Technology of Coring for Bottom Soft Sediments	OCEANOLOGY												A new technology for coring of weakly consolidated sediment is proposed. The technology includes the original coring system and the way it is operated. The technology is based on a number of original solutions: (1) unification of the elements of the drill string, where household pipes made of PVC are used as a sampler and rods; (2) the use of the valve mechanism of a simple conical construction; (3) the method of vertical freezing of the core in open air. The coring system makes it possible to obtain the cores of the soft bottom sediment in winter from ice at a water depth of up to 7-10 m. Field tests have shown that the proposed system is inexpensive, easy to assemble and operate, very effective, and reliable. The new system can be used as an alternative or complement to existing systems for coring of bottom sediments.

Ingested mussels are crushed, but the internal septum in the umbonal region of the mussel usually remains intact. Using mussels collected at Point Pelee, Lake Erie, I showed that there is a strong relationship between the length of the septum and of the mussel (r2 = 0.96). 1 compared this with a similar relationship developed for European zebra mussels and tested both models on mussels collected from Point Pelee and from Stoney Point, Lake St. Clair. Septal length relative to mussel length was greatest at Stoney Point and least at Point Pelee. The European estimates fell between the two. I concluded that to obtain accurate estimates of mussel length when investigating size-selective predation on zebra mussels, the relationship between mussel and septal lengths should,be determined at each study location.																			0008-4301					DEC	1992	70	12					2486	2490		10.1139/z92-333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z92-333													WOS:A1992KG39400028
J	Blum-Reid, S				Blum-Reid, Sylvie			Sylvain Tesson : La Consolation de la foret	CONTEMPORARY FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES												French travel writer Sylvain Tesson relayed his six months stay alone in a hut by lake Baikal in Dans les forets de Siberie (2011). It is his response to the "call of the wild," an ode to nature and the rejuvenating climate of the Siberian forest. The narrative develops the silence and the physical experience of solitude that Tesson aspired to, rejecting cities and the noise of Western civilization. Life slows down, as the writer reduces the amount of material objects to survive. His main concern is for ecology and how to leave as little of a carbon footprint as possible onto the landscape. Tesson manages to slow down time and opposes movement, displacement and social acceleration, to fend off what Byung-Chul Han considers hyperactivity. Siberia romantically influences Tesson's writing on the raw geography of the place, its fauna and flora. He references an earlier foray into Siberia by Chris Marker, Lettre de Siberie (1958). However, seen from the summer 2020 situation with fires raging in Siberia, its future is at stake resulting more in a lament for future generations.																			1740-9292	1740-9306				AUG 8	2021	25	4			SI		433	440		10.1080/17409292.2021.1951472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17409292.2021.1951472													WOS:000708203300006

Hydrological changes in southern Africa over the last 200 Ka as recorded in lake sediments from the Tswaing impact crater	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												Sediments from Lake Tswaing (25 degrees 24'30" S, 28 degrees 04'59" E) document hydrological changes in southern Africa over the last 200 Ka. Using high-resolution XRF- scanning, basic geochemistry (TIC, TOC, TN), organic petrology and rock-evil pyrolysis, we identify intervals of decreased carbonate precipitation, increased detrital input, decreased salinity and decreased autochthonous (algal and bacterial) organic matter content that represent periods of less stable water column stratification and increased rainfall. Between 200 and 80 Ka BP, these intervals appear to be contemporaneous with local summer insolation maxima, indicating a strong influence of precessional variability (similar to 23 Ka) on African subtropical climate. This influence weakens during the last glacial period (similar to 80 to 10 Ka BP), when humid intervals at 73 to 68 Ka, 54 to 50 Ka, 37 to 35 Ka and 15 to 10 Ka BP are largely out of phase with insolation changes, and presumably reflect southward displacement of the ITCZ (Inter Tropical Convergence Zone) and/or changes in ocean circulation.

J	Sharma, P; Rai, SC				Sharma, P; Rai, SC			Streamflow, sediment and carbon transport from a Himalayan watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Rivers indeed serve an important role in the carbon fluxes being recognized as a major component to regional and global environmental change. The present study focuses the sediment and carbon transports in a Himalayan watershed (elevational range 300-2650 m asl, area of 3014 ha) at Sikkim, India. The watershed has five perennial streams, all attain significant size during rainy season. The micro-watershed for each perennial stream has a mosaic distribution of land-use practices, viz. forests, agroforestry, agriculture and wastelands. The average discharge in the Rinjikhola, the watershed outlet was 840-850 1 s(-1) in summer season that increased by 5-6 times in rainy season. Sediment concentration varied distinctly with seasons in different streams and the outlet of the watershed. The soil loss rate from the total watershed ranged from 6 to 7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) that accounts to a net loss of 833 t yr(-1) organic carbon, and 2025 t yr(-1) dissolved organic carbon from the watershed, and more than 90% of soil losses were attributable to open cropped area. The stream discharge, soil and carbon loss and precipitation partitioning through different pathways in forest and agroforestry land-use suggest that these land-uses promote conservation of soil and carbon. It is emphasized that a good understanding of carbon transfer through overland flow and discharge is important for policy decisions and management of soil and carbon loss of a Himalayan watershed as it is very sensitive to land-use/cover changes. Therefore, the conversion of forest to agricultural land should be reversed. Agroforestry systems should be included in agricultural land in mountainous regions. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Discriminant analyses were performed to determine and correlate the composite gradient of physical-chemical variables that separated the six study regions, East Poyang Lake (LPY), Open LPY, North LPY, Dongting, Meiliang Bay, and Taihu center, with variables including suspended solids (SS), Secchi depth (SD), water temperature (WT), chemical oxygen demand (COD), flow velocity, and total nitrogen-to-total phosphorous (TN:TP) molar ratio. A regression analysis showed that the interactions between the SS and TP concentrations affected the phytoplankton biomass in the lentic (Meiliang Bay and East LPY) and partly lotic (Open LPY and Dongting) zones. The trophic level index (TLI)-phytoplankton, SS-phytoplankton, and TP-phytoplankton relationships revealed that hydrological (water velocity) and physical (underwater light penetration) conditions had the greatest effect on the algal biomass in the eutrophic Yangtze-connected lakes, whereas phytoplankton growth was mainly related to nutrients in the eutrophic Yangtze-isolated lake.

Remote sensing from space allows the monitoring of vast unin-habitated regions like the Siberian Arctic. This study presents results from monitoring of snowmelt events during spring, the thaw of the active layer on different geomorphological units on tundra land surfaces, as well as lake-ice decay from high resolution TerraSAR-X and quad-pol RADARSAT-2 timeseries acquired over the central Lena Delta, Siberia. The main findings are that X-band data do not show a backscatter difference between frozen and thawed soils, whereas the C-band backscatter rises in the order of 3 dB. Polarimetric decompositions show the spatial extend of snowmelt events and help to distinguish between different geomorphological units. The high spatial resolution of the TerraSAR-X images is extremely helpful to distinguish between land surfaces and the frequent ponds in the investigation area.

J	Witham, F; Woods, AW; Gladstone, C				Witham, Fred; Woods, Andrew W.; Gladstone, Charlotte			An analogue experimental model of depth fluctuations in lava lakes	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Lava lakes, consisting of molten degassing lava in summit craters of active basaltic volcanoes, sometimes exhibit complex cycles of filling and emptying on timescales of hours to weeks such as recorded at Pu'u'O'o in Hawaii and Oldoinyo Lengai in Tanzania. Here we report on a new series of analogue laboratory experiments of two-phase flow in a reservoir-conduit-lava lake system which spontaneously generates oscillations in the depth of liquid within the lake. During the recharge phase, gas supplied from a subsurface reservoir of degassing magma drives liquid magma up the conduit, causing the lake to fill. As the magmastatic pressure in the lake increases, the upward supply of magma, driven by the gas bubbles, falls. Eventually the upflow becomes unstable, and liquid drains downwards from the lake, driven by the magmastatic pressure of the overlying lake, suppressing the ascent of any more bubbles from the chamber. At a later stage, once the lake has drained sufficiently, the descent speed of liquid through the conduit decreases below the ascent speed of the bubbles, and the recharge cycle resumes. Application of a quantitative model of the experiments to the natural system is broadly consistent with field data.																			0258-8900	1432-0819				JUL	2006	69	1					51	56		10.1007/s00445-006-0055-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00445-006-0055-8													WOS:000240107700004

We found no statistical difference in the bilogarithmic relationships (total cations vs. conductivity; salinity vs. conductivity) for waters of higher salinity (K-25 > 1000 muS cm(-1)) and waters of lower salinity (K-25 < 1000 muS cm(-1)). However, comparison among our models and models from the literature suggests that developing separate equations for low and high salinity water bodies has some merit.

Mineral dust transport to the Sierra Nevada, California: Loading rates and potential source areas	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The transport and deposition of aeolian dust represents an important material input pathway for many marine and terrestrial ecosystems and may be an ecologically significant source of exogenous phosphorus (P) to alpine lakes. In order to assess the abundance and elemental composition of atmospheric mineral dust over the Sierra Nevada of California, we collected size-fractionated atmospheric particulate matter (PM) samples during July 2008 to March 2009 at a mixed conifer site located in Sequoia National Park. PM concentrations were at their highest levels during the dry season, averaging 8.8 +/- 3.7 and 11.1 +/- 7.5 mu g m(-3) for the coarse (1 mu m < D-a < 15 mm) and fine (D-a < 1 mu m) fractions, respectively, while winter months were characterized by low (< 1 mu g m(-3)) PM concentrations in both size fractions. Using Al as a diagnostic tracer for mineral aerosol, we observed a significant and uniform contribution (50-80%) from aeolian dust to the total coarse PM load, whereas submicron particles contained comparatively little crustal material (7-33%). The mass concentrations of elements (Fe, Ca, Mg, P, and V) in the coarse PM fraction were significantly correlated with Al throughout the study, and coarse PM exhibited elemental signatures that were temporally consistent and distinguishable from those of other sites. Conversely, higher elemental enrichments were observed in the fine PM fraction for Fe, V, and P, indicating a greater contribution from anthropogenic emissions to the fine particle load. Fe/Al and Fe/Ca ratios suggest a mixture of mineral dust from regional agricultural activities and long-range transport of mineral dust from Asia. Asian sources comprised 40-90% of mineral dust in July 2008 and then declined to between 10 and 30% in August and early September.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				FEB 17	2011	116								G01018	10.1029/2010JG001394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JG001394													WOS:000287522700001

Pelagic flatworm predation on daphniids in a subtropical reservoir: different effects on Daphnia galeata and on Ceriodaphnia quadrangula	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Following a reduction in fish populations in 2004-2005, a new, single annual pulse of pelagic flatworms was observed in early summer during 2006-2009 in Liuxihe, a freshwater reservoir in South China. As soon as these worms appear, Daphnia galeata retreats into dormancy, one month earlier (July) in the presence of flatworms than previously observed (August) with fish, while the population of the related Ceriodaphnia quadrangula tends to increase. We show, through in situ lake sampling, in large enclosures and by laboratory observations, that Ceriodaphnia, although perhaps competitively inferior in its ability to acquire algal food, has a higher tolerance to flatworm toxins. As a result, Ceriodaphnia manages to coexist with and proliferate in the presence of the flatworm. Observations in the laboratory suggest that flatworm population autoregulates by being sensitive to their own toxins and that Ceriodaphnia, even if prey to the worms, likely incurs more benefit than cost from their presence.

A minor rise in lake productivity and the immigration of Betula pubescens occurred ca. 11,500 cal yr B.P. The rise in summer temperatures probably led to increased melting of remnant ice and enhanced erosion.

Treatments included both grouting and the construction of a concrete cutoff wall; however, minimal foundation treatment was performed in an area now experiencing sinkhole development and leakage. High (record) rainfalls in the Spring of 1996 forced reservoir waters into the spillway entrance where it remained for an extended amount of time. This resulted in the development of sinkholes and the subsequent reservoir leakage from the spillway to the Robert Hall Cave emergent downstream of the project. Consequently, the discharge at the Robert Hall weir experienced an increase from a normal 40 gpm to an estimated 4000 gpm. Total reservoir leakage was minimized by emergency sandbagging and filling of the sinkholes. Subsequent geotechnical and geophysical investigations were conducted to determine the most prudent temporary and permanent methods of repair. The investigations in the area of minimal foundation treatment have documented localized zones where the limestone section has undergone complete solutioning; therefore, without corrective action, the potential exists for loss of reservoir to approximately 30 feet below seasonal pool. A temporary levee has been constructed across the spillway entrance to provide an effective, cost efficient means to minimize further sinkhole development in the spillway floor until the design and construction of a multi-row grout cutoff is in place.																									1998							109	120																WOS:000082313800010

Deltaic floodplain wetland vegetation dynamics along the sediment surface elevation gradient and in response to disturbance from river flooding and hurricanes in Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Herbaceous wetland vegetation species percent cover data collected over five growing seasons (2007-2011) was used to define unique species assemblages along the elevation gradient of deltaic islands in the actively prograding deltaic floodplain wetlands in the Wax Lake Delta, a major distributary of the Mississippi River. The passage of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in September 2008 as well as a major river flood in spring of 2011 provided an opportunity to quantify the response and recovery of the vegetation community following disturbances of varying intensities. Two significant persistent species assemblages were observed from 2007 through 2011. The higher elevation species assemblage occurred above mean low water (MLW; -0.04 m NAVD88). While the lower elevation species assemblage occurred at elevations ranging from -0.47 to 0.30 m NAVD88. These unique lower and higher elevation species assemblages overlap at intertidal elevations. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike dras-tically reduced aboveground vegetation and percent cover immediately following the storms particularly for lower elevation species. No aboveground cover was observed for Sagittaria latifolia, Nelumbo lutea, Potamogeton nodosus, or Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) in any of the sampling stations following the hurricanes, com-pared to pre-hurricane aboveground cover mean ranging from 2 to 5%. Sagittaria platyphylla aboveground cover decreased from a pre-hurricane mean of 12.5% to <1% following the hurricanes. In subsequent years the commu-nity composition for all species returned to pre-disturbance cover, with the significant species assemblages returning within two years. In 2011 the major river flood resulted in disturbance that reduced species richness within both assemblages, likely related to differences in flood tolerance of vegetation species, with Nelumbo lutea cover expanding from a mean of 10% cover in the year prior to the flood to 22.5% following the flood. Veg-etation community composition was shown to be robust to major river floods and hurricane storm surge passage. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, their input dynamics and fate in surface waters are still rather poorly understood. This study compares the aquatic fate, concentration levels, and dynamics of the transformation product metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid (metolachlor ESA) and its parent compound metolachlor, an often-used corn herbicide. To this end, laboratory photolysis studies were combined with highly temporally resolved concentration measurements and lake mass balance modeling in the study area of Lake Greifensee (Switzerland). It is found that the two compounds show distinctly different concentration dynamics in the lake tributaries. Concentration-discharge relationships for metolachlor ESA in the main tributary showed a high baseflow concentration and increasing discharge dependence during harvest season, whereas baseflow concentrations of metolachlor were negligible and the discharge dependence was restricted to the period immediately following application. From this it was estimated that 70% of the yearly load of metolachlor ESA to the lake was due to groundwater recharge, whereas, for metolachlor, the bigger part of the load, 50-80%, stemmed from event-driven runoff. Lake mass balance modeling showed that the input dynamics of metolachlor and metolachlor ESA are reflected in their concentration dynamics in the lake's epilimnion and that both compounds show a similar fate in the epilimnion of Lake Greifensee during the summer months with half-lives on the order of 100-200 days, attributable to photolysis and another loss process of similar magnitude, potentially biodegradation. The behavior of metolachlor ESA can likely be generalized to other persistent and highly mobile transformation products. In the future, this distinctly different behavior of mobile pesticide transformation products should find a more appropriate reflection in exposure models used in chemical risk assessment and in pesticide risk management.

The island hillfort of Plune (Olsborg) appears for the first time in the source information of the chronicler Adam Bremen in 1070. At the Olsborg hillfort island 15 spearheads and javelins were discovered excavated from a small area of investigated bridge debris. This assemblage falls, in the light of dendrochronological research, between the late 10th and late 11th centuries. However, taking into account the information from written sources about the German conquest of Vagria and the destruction of the hillfort in 1138-1142, it can be presumed that also in those years some of the pole arm discovered there may have been lost in the area of the bridge.																			0208-6034	2449-8300					2021		36					395	420		10.18778/0208-6034.36.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.18778/0208-6034.36.19													WOS:001146356000006

Although a great deal of research results were obtained, such as lake-wetland ecosystem management and eco-hydrological mechanism of eco-environment evolution, there are few researches about comprehensive analysis on evolution trend and driven mechanism of lake-wetland water eco-environment. Baiyangdian, the biggest grass-type lake-wetland in North China, was chosen as the research object in this paper. Based on the long-term and field observations of water environmental quality and analysis for remote sensing images of water ecological landscape pattern, the evolution trend and driving mechanism for water eco-environment of Baiyangdian in the past 60 years have been studied systematically. The results showed that the average annual water level fluctuated greatly with a decreasing tendency as a whole. During 1974 and 2007, there was a general pattern of land use types, which the emergent plants, water body and cultivated land were the main, and the residential area, forest land, grass land and unused land were distributed as flower arrangement state. During the periods, the water body and emergent plants areas were decreased respectively by 28.7% and 20.8%, while the cultivated land areas were increased by 69.7%. The main pollutants (NH4+-N, CODMn, BOD5, TP, and TN) concentrations in Baiyangdian Lake were changed greatly with spatiotemporal variation and the pollutant concentrations were increased obviously. In the three polluted regions (north zone, south zone, and mixed zone), the north zone was polluted most seriously. The main pollutants concentrations were fluctuated obviously over a year, and the pollution was more serious in summer of normal and dry years, while the pollution was serious at the beginning of summer flood in wet years, and then became less. At last, the evolution trend and driven mechanism of water eco-environment of Baiyangdian was analyzed from three aspects, including typical climate indexes (such as precipitation, evaporation, air temperature, and solar radiation), ecological/environmental hydrology regime in upstream watershed of Baiyangdian, and human activities. It would provide some references to the comprehensive treatment of water eco-environment in Baiyangdian Lakes.

We analyzed the spatial and interannual variability of plant functional type biomass from field studies in low arctic tussock tundra and compared these to climate change simulations of plant community composition using a dynamic tundra vegetation model (ArcVeg). Spatial heterogeneity of peak season live aboveground biomass was estimated using field samples taken from low arctic tundra at Ivotuk, Alaska (68.5degreesN, 155.7degreesW) in 1999. Coefficients of variation for live aboveground biomass at the 1 m(2) scale ranged from 14.6% for deciduous shrubs, 18.5% for graminoids and 25.3% for mosses to over 57% for forbs and lichens. Spatial heterogeneity in the ArcVeg dynamic vegetation model was simulated to be greater than the field data, ranging from 37.1% for deciduous shrubs to 107.9% for forbs. Disturbances in the model, such as caribou grazing and freezing-thawing of soil, as well as demographic stochasticity, led to the greater variability in the simulated results. Temporal variances of aboveground live biomass over a 19-year period using data from Toolik Lake, AK fell within the range of field and simulation spatial variances. However, simulations using ArcVeg suggest that temporal variability can be substantially less than site-scale spatial variability. Field data coupled with ArcVeg simulations of climate change scenarios indicate that some changes in plant community composition may be detectable within two decades following the onset of warming, and shrubs and mosses might be the key indicators of community change. Model simulations also project increasing landscape scale spatial heterogeneity (particularly of shrubs) with increasing temperatures.

J	Horppila, J; Peltonen, H				Horppila, J; Peltonen, H			A bioenergetic approach on food consumption of roach (Rutilus rutilus (L)) in a eutrophic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												A bioenergetics model was fitted for roach to estimate their food consumption in L. Vesijarvi, southern Finland. When tested with independent data the consumption estimates by the bioenergetics model differed less than 10 % from those obtained with other methods. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model estimates are most sensitive to changes in the respiration parameters, the relative change in the consumption estimate being of the same magnitude as that in the value of the parameter. In L. Vesijarvi the bioenergetics model underestimated the seasonal growth of roach age groups 3 and 5 in July and overestimated the growth of older roach, which was due to differences in food availability. The decline in the proportion of maximum ration consumed (the P-values of the model) in late summer was steepest in the age groups 3 and 5 due to the the collapse of the cladoceran density, while older roach were able to complement their diets with plants and detritus. The daily consumption rates were highest in July-August reaching 1.2-2.5 g ww in the different age groups. It is suggested that the growth rate of roach is at present limited by the long capture and handling times of the small-sized cladocerans dominant in the lake. Older age groups can complement their diets with other food items but they are also forced to carry out energy-consuming migrations and their growth rate remains low.																			0003-9136						1997	139	2					207	222																WOS:A1997XC27100006

However, whether abrupt climate changes intensified during past warm periods remains poorly constrained due to the lack of high- resolution geological records. Here, we report a 512- m predominantly lacustrine sedimentary record from the Weihe Basin (North China), revealing that lake levels fluctuated significantly on suborbital (half- and quarter- precession) and millennial timescales over the last 2 Ma. Grain- size results reveal that magnitudes of rapid lake level fluctuations increased dramatically during Pleistocene interglacials, differing from glacial amplification of abrupt climate events recorded in North Atlantic marine sediments. Model results indicate that summer insolation maxima in low- latitude region of both hemispheres can lead to intensified monsoon precipitation in East Asia. Our proxy- model comparison highlights the importance of low- latitude bihemispheric insolation maxima in driving millennial- scale hydroclimatic variability in a warming future.

J	HOLLIDAY, VT				HOLLIDAY, VT			MIDDLE HOLOCENE DROUGHT ON THE SOUTHERN HIGH-PLAINS	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The climate of the Southern High Plains during the middle Holocene is indicated by data from a variety of sources. Stratigraphic, geomorphic, and pedologic research at six localities in draws, several dune sites, and one playa-lake basin show that widespread eolian erosion and sedimentation began in some areas by 9000 yr B.P. and culminated 6000-4500 yr B.P., probably because of warmer, drier conditions that reduced the vegetative cover. Archaeological investigations at three sites provide evidence for the excavation of wells at this time, apparently because of a declining water table. Studies of a few vertebrate and invertebrate faunas also indicate warming and drying in the middle Holocene. Climate models and very limited isotopic data from Bison bone suggest that summers in the middle Holocene were warmer than present, with reduced effective precipitation. All lines of evidence indicate that the Southern High Plains was subjected to prolonged drought in the middle Holoecene with a maximum between 6500 and 4500 yr B.P., conforming climatically and chronologically to the Altithermal.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	1989	31	1					74	82		10.1016/0033-5894(89)90086-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(89)90086-0													WOS:A1989T242100006

Diversity and nodulation effectiveness of rhizobia and mycorrhizal presence in climbing dry beans grown in Prespa lakes plain, Greece	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY												The Prespa lakes plain is an isolated area where about 1000 ha are seeded to Phaseolus vulgaris L. and Phaseolus coccineus L. Nodulation, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) presence and the genetic diversity of rhizobia were evaluated by 16S-ITS-23S-RFLP patterns and by sequencing. The bean rhizobial population in the region was diverse, despite its geographic isolation. No biogeographic relationships were detected, apart from a Rhizobium tropici-related strain that originated from an acidic soil. No clear pattern was detected in clustering with bean species and all isolates formed nodules with both bean species. Most strains were related to Rhizobium leguminosarum and a number of isolates were falling outside the already characterized species of genus Rhizobium. Application of heavy fertilization has resulted in high soil N and P levels, which most likely reduced nodulation and AMF spore presence. However, considerable AMF root length colonization was found in most of the fields.

J	Tamada, K				Tamada, Katsumi			Seasonal change in habitat use by Grey Herons in a rural area of western Hokkaido	ORNITHOLOGICAL SCIENCE												To evaluate the relative importance of rice fields for Grey Herons Ardea cinerea, habitat use by the herons in rural areas, including farmlands, streams, ponds, and lakes, was investigated in Ishikari district, western Hokkaido. To clarify habitat use by herons, censuses along 81 km long routes in rural areas and point counts at four sites (ponds and lakes) were conducted. Grey Herons used rice fields from mid June to mid August, but did not use this habitat either in April or after late September. Some herons used pond, lake, and river habitats in early April, but the number of herons in these habitats decreased from early June onwards and increased again from mid August until mid September. Heron numbers declined in late September, with few herons using ponds, lakes, and rivers until mid November. Herons used natural wetland habitats in spring, but when rice fields were flooded, they switched to this habitat. When water was drained from rice fields in late August, herons returned to natural wetlands. Observations revealed that herons feed mainly on tadpoles in rice fields and on small fish in ponds and lakes. Foraging success was higher, and time to capture one prey item was shorter, in rice fields compared with that in lakes and ponds. Intensive use of rice fields by Grey Herons coincided with the occurrence of Japanese Tree Frog Hyla japonica tadpoles in this habitat type. Grey Herons therefore use rice fields to feed on tadpoles. This suggests that tadpoles are important prey item for Grey Herons in this region.																			1347-0558					DEC	2012	11	2					95	102		10.2326/osj.11.95	http://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.11.95													WOS:000313396000003
J	Bégin, Y				Bégin, Y			Ice-push disturbances in high-Boreal and Subarctic lakeshore ecosystems since AD 1830, northern Quebec, Canada	HOLOCENE												Ice scars on lakeshore trees were surveyed on the islands of two large lakes in northern Quebec: Clearwater Lake (1270 km(2)) and Bienville Lake (900 km(2)), respectively at the southern edge of the Subarctic and at the northern limit of the Boreal zones. Correspondence of ice-scar chronologies with hydrological and climatological instrumental registers indicated that shore ice pushes are due to lake floods. In the AD 1930s, a shift in the flood regimes occurred. In the high Boreal, ice-push activity was much more frequent prior to 1930 than in the Subarctic. Major regional ice pushes occurred in An 1854, 1903, 1914, 1936, 1947, 1954, 1959-60, 1970 and 1979. Prior to 1930, local major events were concentrated south of the Subarctic zone, but the situation inverted after 1930. A northward shift in the average position of the Arctic front is postulated as having been the driving force of local hydrologic regimes that allowed ice disturbances to occur, especially in controlling the amount of snowfall. Ice scars provide proxy indicators of an increase in the frequency of snowy winters between the mid-1930s and 1980. The recent period of low levels represents an anomalous incursion in the century trend, but equivalent long episodes of low seasonal lake levels occurred prior to 1930.																			0959-6836					MAR	2000	10	2					179	189		10.1191/095968300672152610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/095968300672152610													WOS:000085661500003

However, due to the special aquifer structure in the karst areas of southern China, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can easily enter the water environment of underground rivers and cause serious pollution, which will affect the water quality safety. In this study, Qing-shui Spring underground river in Nanning city was selected as a representative of the typical underground river in southern China, and the pollution characteristics, source analysis, ecological risk assessment and diffusion law of PAHs were studied. The results showed that the total concentration of PAHs in groundwater and surface sediments was in the range of 282.42-464.88 ng/L and 400.14-1194.69 ng/g, respectively, and the overall concentrations of PAHs were below the moderate pollution level. Pollutant discharge and physical and chemical properties of PAHs caused the concentrations of PAHs to decrease gradually from upstream to downstream, but the proportion of high-cyclic PAHs increased gradually. According to the source analysis results of the ratio method, PAHs sources in groundwater were mainly biomass combustion sources in the upstream, oil sources in the middle and mixed sources in the downstream. Sediment and groundwater had some differences. The middle and upper reaches were the source of biomass combustion, while the middle and lower reaches were the mixed source. The ecological risk assessment results showed that the ecological risk of groundwater was at a moderate level, while the ecological risk of sediment was at a low level. Benzo[a]anthracene (BaA) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF) in groundwater and acenaphthylene (Acy) and fluoranthene (Flu) in sediment should be monitored intensively. Appropriate control measures should be put in place to prevent further pollution. Partition coefficients varied from 0.73 to 3.85 L/g in the sediment-water interface, increasing with the rise of PAH compounds. All of the organic carbon partition coefficients (K-oc) in the sediment-water interface were higher than predicate values based on the typical model of equilibrium distribution; this indicated that PAHs were strongly adsorbed in the sediment. The linear free energy relationship coefficient between the K-oc value and the n-octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow) was 0.85 but the slope was lower than 1, indicating that sediment in the Qing-shui Spring underground river had weak lipophilic characteristics and adsorption ability for PAHs. The results can provide a reference for the risk assessment and pollution control of PAHs in the karst underground rivers in South China.																				2073-4441				OCT	2021	13	19							2655	10.3390/w13192655	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13192655													WOS:000726692500001

Genetic connectivity and phenotypic plasticity in the cyprinodont Aphanius farsicus from the Maharlu Basin, south-western Iran	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Meristic and morphometric characteristics, including otolith data, of the Farsi tooth-carp Aphanius farsicus, which is endemic to the endorheic Maharlu Basin in south-western Iran, were analysed for a sample of 92 individuals from four spring-streams; DNA sequence data (cytochrome b gene) are presented for 29 specimens. Some phenotypic variation was detected but the genetic data clearly indicate connectivity between the populations. Possible links between phenotypic variation and environmental variables such as water temperature, habitat size and absence or presence of predators and competitors are discussed. Based on a literature survey and the new data, it is concluded that population connectivity is maintained during times of droughts via large aquifers that formed during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene, when the extant endorheic Maharlu Basin was created. Based on new data presented here and previous work, it is apparent that plastic and constant characteristics are present in Aphanius species, and that, if a population becomes isolated, a given trend of evolution may give rise to a taxonomically useful characteristic.

M.; Vonk, Jorien E.; Dolman, Han			Geochemical, sedimentological and microbial diversity in two thermokarst lakes of far Eastern Siberia	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Thermokarst lakes are important conduits for organic carbon sequestration, soil organic matter (soil-OM) decomposition and release of atmospheric greenhouse gases in the Arctic. They can be classified as either floating-ice lakes, which sustain a zone of unfrozen sediment (talik) at the lakebed year-round, or as bedfast-ice lakes, which freeze all the way to the lakebed in winter. Another key characteristic of thermokarst lakes are their eroding shorelines, depending on the surrounding landscape, they can play a major role in supplying the lakebeds with sediment and OM. These differences in winter ice regime and eroding shorelines are key factors which determine the quantity and quality of OM in thermokarst lake sediments. We used an array of physical, geochemical, and microbiological tools to identify the differences in the environmental conditions, sedimentary characteristics, carbon stocks and microbial community compositions in the sediments of a bedfast-ice and a floating-ice lake in Far East Siberia with different eroding shorelines. Our data show strong differences across most of the measured parameters between the two lakes. For example, the floating-ice lake contains considerably lower amounts of sediment organic matter and dissolved organic carbon, both of which also appear to be more degraded in comparison to the bedfast-ice lake, based on their stable carbon isotope composition (delta 13C). We also document clear differences in the microbial community composition, for both archaea and bacteria. We identified the lake water depth (bedfast-ice vs. floating-ice) and shoreline erosion to be the two most likely main drivers of the sedimentary, microbial and biogeochemical diversity in thermokarst lakes. With ongoing climate warming, it is likely that an increasing number of lakes will shift from a bedfast- to a floating-ice state, and that increasing levels of shoreline erosion will supply the lakes with sediments. Yet, still little is known about the physical, biogeochemical and microbial differences in the sediments of these lake types and how different eroding shorelines impact these lake systems.					; Belelli Marchesini, Luca/M-3554-2014; Maximov, Trofim/J-8964-2016; Vonk, Jorien/H-5422-2011; Dolman, Albertus/B-8552-2012; Rijkers, Ruud/GZN-0478-2022; Jetten, Mike/B-8834-2011; Reichart, Gert-Jan/N-6308-2018; Dean, Joshua/P-9009-2017; Bouillon, Steven/C-5177-2011; Welte, Cornelia/M-6165-2014	Karsanaev, Sergey/0000-0002-4055-381X; Belelli Marchesini, Luca/0000-0001-8408-4675; van Huissteden, Jacobus/0000-0001-7730-2793; Vonk, Jorien/0000-0002-1206-5878; Rijkers, Ruud/0000-0001-7263-8917; Reichart, Gert-Jan/0000-0002-7256-2243; Dean, Joshua/0000-0001-9058-7076; Meisel, Ove/0000-0002-6431-6659; Wacker, Lukas/0000-0002-8215-2678; Dolman, A.J./0000-0003-0099-0457; in 't Zandt, Michiel/0000-0002-0497-4502													0168-2563	1573-515X				SEP	2023	165	3					239	263		10.1007/s10533-023-01076-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-023-01076-1		AUG 2023											WOS:001077048300001

However, palaeoecological studies relying on these aquatic invertebrates have generally focused on post-glacial lakes, with relatively few applications to floodplain water bodies such as palaeo-oxbow lakes. In this study, zone-level (stratigraphic) trends in Chironomidae and Cladocera assemblage composition were analysed from a small palaeo-oxbow lake in a Central European river valley of Poland. Summer air temperature and hydrological conditions were found to be the main drivers of Cladocera and Chironomidae populations, causing a cascade effect in assemblage composition. At the local habitat scale, there were autecological differences in both taxonomic groups reflecting different responses to abiotic and biotic factors. Specifically, Cladocera responded distinctly to plant vegetation and fish predation during the Late Glacial lake phase, whereas Chironomidae were more sensitive to paludification processes and disappeared in the Northgrippian dry phase of the mire. Both groups indicated fluvial activity of the River Grabia, although the response was different. Also, species richness was higher in the more taxonomically diverse Chironomidae compared to Cladocera. As both groups responded to the same factors in a different way, it is recommended that they should be used in parallel in palaeoecological research studies.

Varied impact of land use on water and sediment parameters in fish ponds of the Dombes agro-ecosystem, France	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Agricultural land use in the area of water bodies is generally considered to increase the nutrient status of the water body water and sediments, but is this also the case for already nutrient-rich fish ponds? We studied 83 fish ponds in the Dombes region, France, where 1100 ponds are located in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape. Different water and sediment parameters were analysed for ponds and in ditches after rainfall events. Land use was studied in the primary catchment of ponds and in a 100-m zone around ponds. Soil parameters of different land-use types were analysed and farmers interviewed about agricultural practices. Increasing cropping area in the catchment of the ponds is significantly correlated to higher PO43- concentration of pond water and to a lower degree, also to NO3-, but only in certain years with higher rainfall and with a more uneven distribution in spring. Sediment parameters were not significantly influenced. High NO3- concentration in the water of a ditch during significant rainfall events was found for a cropland dominated catchment.

The animals apparently colonized the reservoir during the late 19th century, reached a population peak during the first half of the 20th century, and have declined since to near extinction. The apparent causes of this decline are habitat loss due to urbanization, adult salamander mortality from automobiles, loss of larvae during the annual reservoir drainage, and possibly predation by transient fish populations. Recommendations to preserve the population and to allow its size to increase include: (1) construction of a drift fence and tunnel system to divert migrating adults and juveniles underneath the highway, (2) maintenance of water levels through mid-summer to allow most larvae to complete metamorphosis, and (3) excavation of sumps in the lake bed to entrap larvae and keep them from being swept down the lake drain.																			0022-1511					JUN	1994	28	2					159	164		10.2307/1564615	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1564615													WOS:A1994NU81300005

In the southern population from the northern coast of the Issyk-Kul lake [USA], insects with a long-day photoperiodical reactions (PPR) are observed along with the insects with continuous life cycle. In Leningrad population, most insects have a long-day PPR, some have continuous life cycle and obligate diapause. The Syvtyvkar population has mainly a short-day PPR at the background of obligate diapause. The most northern population from Apatity is represented mostly by obligate diapause and the short-day PPR. The possible phylogenetic connections of the studied features and the mechanism of retaining of the observed heterogeneity in the populations have been discussed.																			0044-4596					SEP-OCT	1988	49	5					664	669																WOS:A1988Q386800010

In the 1920s, the lake was clear, with a summer Secci depth of about 2 m. During the first half of the 20th century, untreated sewage from the town polluted the lake. In the 1930s, the lake began to show eutrophic characteristics, and in the 1940s, the cyanobacterium Gloetrichia echinulata dominated in summer. In 1949, the first municipal sewage treatment plant was built. The treatment was, however, insufficient, since the lake continued to be the recipient of the effluent with the result that the occurrence of cyanobacteria became more frequent. Species such as Microcystis and Anabaena caused skin rash and allergic symptoms among swimmers. The phosphorus load on Lake Finjasjon increased as the population of Hassleholm grew and reached a peak value of 65 tons annum(-)1 in 1965. In 1977, the sewage plant was rebuilt to include chemical flocculation, reducing the total external phosphorus load to about 5 tons annum(-)1. Despite this improvement the lake did not recover from its chronic and toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Phosphorus-leaking black sediments were identified as the cause of the lake's failure to recover. Some 60% of lakebed area is covered with sediments on average 3 m thick. Dredging the sediments was started on a large scale in 1987. Five years later, 25% of the sediment area had been removed but the dredging was stopped since phosphorus continued to be released into the water from these areas. In 1992, a new restoration policy, a combination of further reduced external nutrient loading and food-web manipulation was initiated. A constructed wetland (30 ha) to reduce phosphorus and nitrogen was created in connection to the effluent from the sewage treatment plant. Protection zones along the feeder streams into Lake Finjasjon were also established. A cyprinid reduction programme by trawling was carried out between 1992 and 1994. When it started, the fish community was composed of 90-95% bream and roach. After two years of trawling, the ratio between piscivorous and planktivorous fish was 1:1. In 1994 and 1995, the transparency increased due to a considerably reduced biomass of phytoplankton and a radically altered phytoplankton community. The monoculture of Microcystis was replaced by a diverse phytoplankton community. The increased transparency made possible the development of submerged macrophytes such as Elodea, Myriophyllum and Potamogeton. The internal loading of phosphorus decreased dramatically in 1994 and 1995, possibly as a result of reduced sedimentation of phytoplankton.

Linking aquatic and terrestrial environments: can beaver canals serve as movement corridors for pond-breeding amphibians?	ANIMAL CONSERVATION												Beavers Castor canadensis are well known as ecosystem engineers for creating ponds by damming streams. However, in wetlands with soft substrates and shallow banks, beavers often dig networks of foraging canals, the ecological effects of which have received little study. We examined how canals are used by pond-breeding amphibians during dispersal and migration between aquatic and terrestrial habitat, focusing on the wood frog Lithobates sylvaticus, in Miquelon Lake Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada. In late summer, the number of emigrating young-of-the-year (YOY) wood frogs encountered at drift fences in riparian zones was highest at beaver canals and declined with distance from canal edges. On visual encounter surveys along the pond perimeter, YOY and adult wood frogs were up to nine times more abundant on beaver canals than along shorelines not modified by beavers. Beaver canals provided habitat for adult wood frogs and also functioned as movement corridors for emigrating YOY frogs, with possible implications for survival to maturity, meta-population dynamics and nutrient transfer between aquatic and terrestrial environments.

J	HAYES, FR; LIVINGSTONE, DA				HAYES, FR; LIVINGSTONE, DA			THE TROUT POPULATION OF A NOVA SCOTIA LAKE AS AFFECTED BY HABITABLE WATER, POISONING OF THE SHALLOWS AND STOCKING	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												A stocking, partial-poisoning and creel census experiment was carried out on a stratified lake in an effort to increase the crop of speckled trout, Salvelinus fontinalis. Except for a single year in which adult trout were planted, a negligible proportion of the introduced trout was recaptured. Application annually for five years of about one-half part per million of derris dust to the three-meter zone of the lake during summer stratification produced a heavy kill of coarse fish without harming the trout. Shiner, Notemigonus crysoleucas. perch, Perca flavescens and chub, Semotilus atromaculatus were eliminated from the lake. Sucker, Catostomus commersoni. was drastically reduced. Killifish, Fundulus diaphanus, and eel, Anguilla bostoniensis, were not appreciably reduced, despite large annual kills. Smelt, Osmerus mordax, stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, were killed in very small numbers during one or more poisoning years. Three independent estimates of the effect of the experiment upon the trout production of the lake are put forward: (1) The decrease in mass of the fish competing with trout for food, when calculated from the annual kills, amounts to 40 kg. The pre-poisoning mass of trout was 85 kg, calculated from a capture-recapture census. Thus if trout replaced its competitors quantitatively, the standing crop of trout would be increased to 150%. (2) The volume-time of water (i.e. percentage of the lake volume multiplied by the fraction of a year) which would be made available to trout by removing competitors from the part of the lake where summer temperature conditions would limit trout to between 50 and 100% of their full activity is calculated. If trout occupied this volume-time at the same density as they did the more favourable water, the standing crop of trout would be increased to 240%. (3) The total yield of the lake to anglers showed a steady increase following poisoning, to about 230% of the control value, or from less than 1 lb. per acre to nearly 2 lbs. per acre. These three estimates agree very well, considering the errors inherent in the method.																									1955	12	4					618	635		10.1139/f55-032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f55-032													WOS:A1955WZ51400006

After incubation and ethyl alcohol treatment, dialysis process was operated for partial purification. Levan amounts in our samples after hydrolysis were calculated based on the amount of sugar obtained by acid hydrolysis of standard levan. Sugar amount of samples were determined using by high performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC). H-1-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-1-NMR) spectra of the levan sample and standard were recorded. The results obtained by HPLC analysis showed that Chromohalobacter canadensis strain 85B had highest production potential as 234.67 mg levan/g biomass. The chemical shifts of H-1-NMR spectrum of the extracted levan also showed high similarity to those of pure levan isolated from Erwinia herbicola. Furthermore, Marinobacter sp. 163Y strain also is also capable with regard to levan production. In this study, this strain could yield 230.80 mg/g levan and this potential was first reported in the literature.					; ÇABUK, Ahmet/ABL-4727-2022; çınar, seval/ABG-5668-2021; Çelik, Pınar/AAB-4913-2020; Hoşgün, Emir Zafer/IXW-5284-2023	cinar, seval/0000-0003-4288-5444; 													1338-5178					AUG-SEP	2020	10	1					61	64		10.15414/jmbfs.2020.10.1.61-64	http://dx.doi.org/10.15414/jmbfs.2020.10.1.61-64													WOS:000560753800011

Excessive fishing effort, ongoing declines in landings and low revenues indicate that 75 years of fishery have not been sustainable in terms of socio-economical and ecological stability or avoidance of over-exploitation, despite measures aiming at reductions ill fishing effort throughout the management history. We review the management history with a focus on how responsible fisheries management depends on time scales of management decisions, in comparison to time scales of fish Population dynamics, and ecological changes. Management actions to improve sustainability have been generally implemented with considerable delays and in small steps, to avoid short-term losses in revenues. These actions turned out to be insufficient, its their potential impact was both inadequate and counteracted over time by technical advances in fisheries and by unforeseen ecological changes.

In west Anatolia, the Simav Graben used to be occupied by a lake. However, today it is drained and associated with Holocene sediments that record lake level changes. An initial drill-core at the lake's centre reveals an arid phase before ca. 14 ka (i.e. prior to the Late Glacial warming) followed by a wet phase (marshes and lake) throughout the Holocene. Along the lake's margin, two additional sediment sequences contain a detailed Holocene record of changes in humidity throughout the Simav Graben's watershed. Classification of the shoreline facies from these sequences records drought events marked by colluvium prograding towards the lake. Using 13 radiocarbon dates, sedimentary facies suggest rapid lake contraction phases grossly around 8.0, 3.9, 2.9, 2.4 and 2.0 ka. After the drier periods, recorded by phases of terrestrial progradation, lake level increase is marked by retrogradational lake muds and peats onlapping the colluvium, consistent with increases in total lake volume. Based on modern lake morphology, climate and runoff data, and the elevations recorded by the shoreline facies identified within the marginal Holocene sedimentary sequence, we constructed a paleohydrologic balance model and a precipitation curve. According to the model, annual precipitation may have been fallen below 460 mm during the 8.2 ka event, and 468-478 mm during the 4.2 ka and 3.2 ka events demonstrating an extreme decrease in precipitation compared to the earlier wet phases. In turn, Holocene Archaeology in West Anatolia outlines (i) a widespread abandonment and/or notable fire events at the end of the Early Bronze Age III (ca. 4.2 ka), and (ii) a high level of social instability at the beginning of the Early Iron Age (ca. 3.2 ka). The correlation between the timing of lake level falls at Simav (water volume depletion caused by drying trends) at 8.0 ka, 3.9 ka and 2.8 ka and cultural fluctuations suggest that drought events may have played a major role in these socio-political changes in western Anatolia. Furthermore, the high lake-level stages (associated with precipitation >500 mm) coincide with the Late Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age I transition as well as the Hellenistic and Roman periods, both times of economic stability and growth in the region.

The main objective envisaged was to analyze bacterial community composition (BCC) and for this purpose systematic and regular sampling of waters from ten different sampling stations, predetermined in the Lake according to differences in degree of human interference and also as zones of special ecological interests were selected. The isolated species were identified according to Bergey's Manual specification by examining their micro and macro morphological characteristics and biochemical characteristics on different culture media. Further confirmation was done by sequencing the 16s rRNA gene by using universal bacterial primers 27F and 1429R. From all the sampling stations the class Bacilli showed a maximum relative abundance with a contribution of 16 bacterial species. The whole process resulted in the identification of Bacillus aerius, Bacillus altitudinis, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus ginsengisoli, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus safensis, Bacillus stratosphericus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus tequilensis, Bacillus thermocopriae, Bacillus thuringiensis, Brevibacillus agri strain, Lysinibacillus boronitolerans, Lysinibacillus pakistanensis and Lysinibacillus sphaericus.

The majority of these water bodies is strongly influenced by high concentrations of dissolved ions and high acidity, and shows pH values around 3. Hereby, a first evaluation is given on the relevance of different parameters, regulating the phytoplankton composition and seasonal succession in the extremely acidic Lake Grunewalde, Lusatia. The phytoplankton biocoenosis, which was analysed for the period April 1996-July 2001, was of low biodiversity with a dominance of the phytoflagellates Ochromonas (Chrysophyceae), Chlamydomonas (Chlorophyta) and Gymnodinium (Dinophyceae). The development of the phytoplankton biomass was low with an average biovolume of 0.64 mm(3) l(-1). The phytoplankton succession revealed a clear dependence from the inorganic carbon. which is, in combination with phosphorus, the limiting major nutrient in acidic lakes. Higher TIC concentrations occurred during ice covering and stagnation periods in the hypolimnion, and were responsible for rapid increases of the planktonic populations with a maximum biovolume around 2-3 mm(3) l(-1). Vertical gradients of hydrochemical parameters and plankton distribution were assessed during the summer stratification period. A daily migration pattern was shown for the dominant mixotrophic nanoflagellate Ochromonas, living in deeper layers of the epi- and metalimnion and migrating to the lake surface during lowering light conditions in the evening. This behaviour is explained as a strategy to receive optimal light supply and to overcome nutrient stress in periods of strong physico-chemical gradients.

The transect of study sites covers the area from similar to 14degreesS to 20degreesS and includes core studies from seven lakes and modem calibration water samples from twenty-three watersheds analyzed to constrain the down-core interpretations of stable isotopes and diatoms. We selected lakes in different hydrologic settings spanning a range of sensitivity to changes in the moisture balance. These include: (1) lakes directly receiving glacial meltwater, (2) overflowing lakes in glaciated watersheds, (3) overflowing lakes in watersheds without active glaciers, and (4) lakes that become closed basins during the dry season. The results of our current work on multiple lakes in the Bolivian Andes show that while the overall pattern of Holocene environmental change is consistent within the region, conditions were not always stable over centennial to over millennial timescales and considerable decadal- to century-scale climate variability is evident [Abbott et al., Quat. Res. 47 (1997) 70-80, Quat. Res. 47 (1997) 169-180, Quat. Sci. Rev. 19 (2000) 1801-1820; Polissar, Master's thesis, University of Massachusetts (1999)]. Comparison of the paleoclimate record from one well-studied site, Lago Taypi Chaka Kkota (LTCK), with others within the region illustrates a consistent overall pattern of aridity from the late glacial through the middle Holocene. Previous work noted a difference between the timing of water-level rise in Lake Titicaca similar to 5.0-3.5 ka B.P. [Abbott et al., Quat. Res. 47 (1997) 169-180; Cross et al., Holocene 10 (2000) 21-32; Rowe et al., Clim. Change 52 (2002) 175-199] and the onset of wetter conditions at 2.3 ka B.P. in LTCK, a lake that drains into the southern end of Lake Titicaca [Abbott et al., Quat. Res. 47 (1997) 70-80]. Sedimentary and oxygen isotope evidence from Paco Cocha (13degrees54'S) located in the northern reaches of the expansive 57000 km(2) Titicaca watershed, which spans similar to 14degreesS to 17degreesS, indicates that glaciers returned to the watershed around 4.8 ka B.P. In addition, sedimentary and geochemical data from Llacho Kkota (15degrees07'S), located between LTCK (16degrees12'S) and Paco Cocha, indicate wetter conditions around 3.4 ka B.P. This suggests wetter conditions occurred first in the northern reaches of the Titicaca watershed and resulted in rising water levels in Lake Titicaca while the LTCK watershed remained unglaciated and seasonally desiccated. Comparison of the paleoclimate records from Paco Cocha, LTCK, and Potosi with other paleoclimate records from the region including Lake Titicaca and Nevado Sajama illustrates a consistent overall pattern of aridity from the late Pleistocene through the middle Holocene, but wetter conditions occurred in the northern areas first, and the aridity in the north was of shorter duration and less severe. The progressive increase in wet season (summer) insolation across the region during the Holocene likely resulted in an increasingly southward position and intensification of the zone of intense summer convection - known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone over the tropical Atlantic and Pacific. We suggest this is the cause of the overall pattern of increasingly later dates for the onset of wetter conditions moving north to south that we observe across the seven lakes discussed here that span four degrees of latitude. However, this does not explain the decadal- to century-scale variability that demonstrably exists at these same sites. Overall the last 2.3 ka has been the wettest period during the Holocene, but even during this relatively wet phase there are century-scale lowstands in lakes, including Titicaca, Llacho Kkota, Juntutuyo (17degrees33'S), and Potosi (19degrees38'S), and significant changes in the extent of glacial activity in the glaciated watersheds of Paco Cocha, LTCK, and Viscachani (16degrees11'S), indicating the continued sensitivity of the region to shifts in the moisture balance.

In the boreal zone, numerous lakes already undergo seasonal hypolimnetic anoxia, but its consequences for the microbial food web (MFW) are still largely unknown. However, the abundance as well as vertical distribution of predators, especially ciliates, in the MFW is generally assumed to be controlled by food and oxygen availability. To determine whether oxygen regulates the MFW, we studied the autotrophic picoplankton (APP), larger phytoplankton, bacteria, nanoflagellates (NFs) and ciliates present throughout the growing season in a small, humic and seasonally strongly stratified lake (Valkea-Kotinen) with an anoxic hypolimnion. The prey numbers in Lake Valkea-Kotinen were low, whereas the predators were numerous. The abundance of NFs, which was coupled with that of bacteria, was especially high. However, our results indicated no clear response to oxygen conditions, although the abundances of the predators were generally higher in the oxic than in the anoxic water layers. The only ciliate feeding group that showed a clear response was the omnivores, which thrived in the hypoxic hypolimnion in early summer. The APP and bacterial abundances were in general high in the upper hypolimnion near the thermocline, which in Lake Valkea-Kotinen is prone to convective mixing. This diurnal disturbance nurtures the autotrophic and heterotrophic community around the thermocline and may also explain the rather high predator abundance in the MFW of Lake Valkea-Kotinen.					; Zingel, Priit/H-8822-2016	Peltomaa, Elina/0000-0002-2858-8358; Zingel, Priit/0000-0003-1629-2063													0948-3055	1616-1564					2013	68	2					91	105		10.3354/ame01602	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01602													WOS:000315598900001

Measurable microcystin in Ozark streams was rare during summer 2018 baseflow conditions	AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS												Accelerated eutrophication due to human activity has been linked to an increase in the occurrence of cyanobacteria in freshwater systems. The purpose of this study was to document the occurrence of microcystin, a common cyanotoxin, within northwest Arkansas streams. Twenty streams were sampled from May through October 2018, and water and periphyton samples were analyzed for microcystin and chlorophyll-a (CHL-a). Mean microcystin concentrations in water samples were low across sites, ranging from < 0.10 to 0.21 mu g L-1. Mean microcystin in the periphyton across sites ranged from 2.6 to 9.9 mu g m(-2) and were within values observed in the literature. All microcystin concentrations measured in these Ozark streams were well below the current USEPA recreational guidelines of 8.0 mu g L-1 and the drinking water guidelines of 0.3 mu g L-1 for infants and 1.6 mu g L-1 for adults.

Forecasting annual cyanobacterial bloom biomass to inform management decisions in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, have been both a public health and ecological concern in Lake Erie for over a decade. Although models were previously developed to forecast cyanobacterial bloom severity, the recent few years of bloom severity observations indicate the need to update these empirical models. The models that best estimate the bloom biomass use the Maumee River discharge or total bioavailable phosphorus (TBP) loading from March through July. TBP is the sum of the dissolved reactive phosphorus and the proportion of particulate phosphorus that is bioavailable, corrected for loss due to settling in the river. In years when average June water temperatures were too low for Microcystis growth (<17 degrees C), the July loads were excluded. As total phosphorus (TP) load includes much phosphorus that is not bioavailable (or reaches the lake), the load of TBP was considered, and it provided a model that better explained the blooms than the TP load. Residual discrepancies between predicted and observed blooms may involve factors such as the timing of the majority of the spring loads (e.g., most in March or most in June or July) and potential influence from an extremely large bloom in the previous year. The most extreme loads, such as seen in 2015, may cause different responses than more moderate loads. The models estimate bloom size in most scenarios observed and can serve as the foundation for setting nutrient reduction targets to decrease the occurrence of blooms in western Lake Erie.

J	Schallenberg, M; James, M; Hawes, I; Howard-Williams, C				Schallenberg, M; James, M; Hawes, I; Howard-Williams, C			External forcing by wind and turbid inflows on a deep glacial lake and implications for primary production	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lake Coleridge is a deep monomictic lake in the Southern Alps of New Zealand which is affected by strong adiabatic winds. It receives significant inputs of inorganic suspended solids from rivers diverted into the lake for hydro-electric generation. External inputs of wind energy and suspended solids to Lake Coleridge were quantified throughout 1 year and their impacts on hydrodynamics and the light climate were analysed. During stratification, the lake had a deep mixed layer, underlain by a complex metalimnion. High wind energy inputs caused large internal waves which resulted in the upwelling of hypolimnetic water, horizontal density gradients, and significant currents. Calculated vertical diffusivity and exchange coefficients were similar to those of much larger lakes. Analyses indicated that mixing in the metalimnion was often a result of shear stresses arising from vertical gradients in horizontal velocities. Whole lake total suspended solids (TSS) burdens were significantly correlated with the previous 13-week integrated TSS loading from inflows. A seasonal pattern was observed where TSS from inflows entered either below, within or above the metalimnion. Evidence of effects of sediment resuspension from the marginal lake bottom was observed only when the lake level was low and the resulting impacts on the light climate were minimal. The synergistic effects of climate, thermal structure, and inflows resulted in the apparent light-limitation of phytoplankton photosynthesis in winter months.

The consideration of various roles of disturbance in creating a spatial and temporal pattern of habitats is made hierarchically at three spatial scales. Segment scale is the largest, represented by a braided river landscape on an alluvial fan. Riparian tree species direct their life history strategies to survive in the shifting habitat dynamics. Reservoirs constructed at the fan apex regulate flood disturbances and seasonal flow variation, changing the dynamic state to a monotonous, static habitat structure. Intermediate reach-scale structures are represented by pool-riffle sequences, gravel bars, secondary and abandoned channels and oxbow lakes. We focused particularly on the lateral variation of the entire valley floor and its stream channel, which provide critical habitats for spawning, hatching, rearing, wintering, feeding and dwelling as well as flow refugia for fish and macroinvertebrates. Bed instability resulting from an increased tractive force due to channel straightening and its impact on macroinvertebrate communities is also discussed. Finally, the smallest scale is the microhabitat seen as the interstitial spaces in gravel beds used by salmonid and benthic fish for all or some of their life stages. Sediment control dams and gravel mining in rivers and floodplains is causing gravel-size sediment starvation, whereas the introduction of fine sediment is substantially increased following land-use development.

This study has monitored chemical hazards in drinking water from source to tap, using effect-based methods. The study was conducted at a Swedish drinking water treatment plant sourcing lake water and aimed to investigate potential seasonal variations in both the raw water and water after different treatment steps. Furthermore, a granular activated carbon (GAC) pilot facility was evaluated. Samples were analyzed for estrogenicity, androgenicity, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity, oxidative stress (Nrf2) response and genotoxicity (micronucleus formation). We observed seasonal differences in oxidative stress and genotoxic effects in both raw and drinking water with higher activities during the late fall of each year. The removal efficiency for both oxidative stress and genotoxicity was limited in the full-scale treatment process and occasionally the genotoxicity was also detected in outgoing drinking water from the treatment plant and in samples collected at consumers tap on the distribution network. AhR activity was present in all raw water samples and the removal was limited. Estrogenic activities were observed in most of the raw water samples but in contrast to the other parameters estrogenicity was effectively reduced by the full-scale conventional treatment. The GAC pilot treatment was generally more efficient than the full-scale conventional treatment in removing all observed bioactivities and could be a viable complement to the current treatment to assure drinking water free from genotoxic compounds. Genotoxic activities in drinking water was observed while all currently regulated chemical parameters were fulfilled. This highlights the need for effect-based monitoring in efforts to ensure the chemical safety of drinking water, as target chemical analysis of single compounds will overlook both unknown hazardous compounds as well as potential mixture effects.

J	An, KG; Park, SS				An, KG; Park, SS			Influence of seasonal monsoon on the trophic state deviation in an Asian reservoir	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Trophic parameters including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), Secchi depth (SD), and chlorophyll-a (CHL) were analyzed to evaluate how the Asian monsoon influences the trophic state of the Taechung Reservoir, Korea. By using conventional criteria, the trophic state of this system ranged from mesotrophic to hypertrophic with spatial and seasonal variations depending on landuse pattern and flow regime. Based on TP, CHL, and transparency, the overall trophic state declined from the headwaters to the dam. However, based on TN, the entire reservoir was hypereutrophic throughout the year. Comparing nutrients and CHL as trophic parameters, large disparities of the trophic state have been observed in the headwaters during intensive monsoon. The trophic state was much greater when assessments were based on nutrients instead of CHL, indicating a potential trophic deviation. Using Carlson's (1990) two dimensional approach, deviations of the Trophic State Index (TSI), based on the relation between TSI (CHL) minus TSI ( TP), and TSI ( CHL) minus TSI (SD) during the intensive monsoon indicated that factors other than phosphorus limited algal growth, and that non-algal particles affect light attenuation. These findings were supported by high non-volatile suspended solids (NVSS), short water residence time, and low CHL: TP ratios during monsoon. Such deviations, however, did not occur during weak monsoon. The trophic disparity during the intensive monsoon was considered to be a result of the short water retention time and reduced light availability through dominance of inorganic suspended solids. Under these circumstances, trophic state assessments based only on nutrient loading may not be a useful indicator for water management.

Both species showed univoltine lifecycles with remarkable differences in winter. H. contubernalis overwintered mainly in the 4th or 5th larval instar; whereas, the more abundant H. pellucidula overwintered in the 2nd or 3rd larval instar. The main larval growth periods of the two species were also different, and this could be due to ecological segregation, which allows both species to share a similar ecological niche. The two species shared the same food habits throughout all larval instars; however, they both changed their food habits as they passed from one instar to another, and earlier instars were more predatory than the older ones.																			0270-5060					JUN	1997	12	2					269	279		10.1080/02705060.1997.9663534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1997.9663534													WOS:A1997WZ07300011

Pine pollen percentages exceed 95% with small amounts of spruce and fir in strata radiocarbon dates as older than 20,000 B. P. Evidently during the Wisconsin pluvial interval a pine forest or pine parkland invaded what is now desert grassland. Toward the bottom of the core pine drops to 40% and an increasing frequency of grass and other summer-rain pollen types suggests a monsoon climate. Superimposed on the overall drop in pine and rise in grass are a series of close-interval fluctuations in which pine may change by 40% within a few cm. These sudden changes are thought to represent brief climatic events of a type not generally recognized in Pleistocene studies.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1963	44	3					436	+		10.2307/1932522	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932522													WOS:A1963P090900025

Lake Dynamics Modulate the Air Temperature Variability Recorded by Sedimentary Aquatic Biomarkers: A Holocene Case Study From Western Greenland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Quantitative temperature reconstructions from lacustrine organic geochemical proxies including branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and alkenones provide key constraints on past continental climates. However, estimation of air temperatures from proxies can be impacted by non-stationarity in the relationships between seasonal air and water temperatures, a factor not yet examined in strongly seasonal high-latitude settings. We pair downcore analyses of brGDGTs and alkenones measured on the same samples through the Holocene with forward-modeled proxy values based on thermodynamic lake model simulations for a western Greenland lake. The measured brGDGT distributions suggest that stable autochthonous (aquatic) production overpowers allochthonous inputs for most samples, justifying the use of the lake model to interpret temperature-driven changes. Conventional calibration of alkenones (detected only after 5.5 thousand years BP) suggests substantially larger temperature variations than conventional calibration of brGDGTs. Comparison of proxy measurements to forward-modeled values suggests variations in brGDGT distributions monotonically reflect multi-decadal summer air temperatures changes, although the length of the ice-free season dampens the influence of air temperatures on water temperatures. Drivers of alkenone variability remain less clear; potential influences include small changes in the seasonality of proxy production or biases toward specific years, both underlain by non-linearity in water-air temperature sensitivity during relevant seasonal windows. We demonstrate that implied temperature variability can differ substantially between proxies because of differences in air-water temperature sensitivity during windows of proxy synthesis without necessitating threshold behavior in the lake or local climate, and recommend that future studies incorporate lake modeling to constrain this uncertainty.					; McKay, Nicholas/JYQ-5440-2024	Morrill, Carrie/0000-0002-1635-5469; Thomas, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6489-7123; Cluett, Allison/0000-0001-7561-0557; Castaneda, Isla/0000-0002-2524-9326													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL	2023	128	7							e2022JG007106	10.1029/2022JG007106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JG007106													WOS:001020782100001

The aerial extension of the lake fluctuates between 1165 km(2) to 906 km(2). The opening of new inlet into the lake has enriched its biodiversity but also has increased the rate of siltation, which inturn affected the lake's water holding capacity, causing ecological repercussions and impacting its flora and fauna. The RUSLE model integrated with remote sensing and GIS techniques was used to assess the soil loss in watershed of Chilika Lake. The model takes into account various factor viz. Crop/cover management factor (C), Soil erodibility factor (K), slope length (L), Conservation support practice factor (P), Rainfall erosivity factor (R), and steepness factor (S) to estimate potential soil loss. The results of the study reveal that 486.92 km(2) i.e., 73.16% area of the Chilika watershed falls under least risk category of soil erosion, 44.17 km(2) (6.6%) under moderate category, while, about 11% is at high, 8.8% at very high, and 0.043 at severe risk of soil erosion. The analysis estimates the annual average soil loss rate in the catchment of Chilika Lake to be 32.41 ton/ha/yr. The raster layers developed to study spatial soil loss indicate that the catchment of the lake is under the grip of soil erosion and siltation problems. Therefore, the study recommends immediate action of conservation and management planning processes to save the lake from further degradation.					kumar, rajiv/AEP-4640-2022; Ahmad, Wani/ABC-8198-2020	AHMAD, WANI SUHAIL/0000-0003-2861-0532; Behera, Dhiroj Kumar/0000-0001-9819-869X													0016-7622	0974-6889				MAR	2023	99	3					406	414		10.1007/s12594-023-2324-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12594-023-2324-y													WOS:000948944900015
J	MCLACHLAN, AJ				MCLACHLAN, AJ			REFUGIA AND HABITAT PARTITIONING AMONG MIDGES (DIPTERA, CHIRONOMIDAE) IN RAIN-POOLS	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. Rain-pools on granite exposures are common in tropical Africa and they are inhabited by the larvae of two midge species, Chironomus imicola Kieffer and Chironomus pulcher Wiedemann. 2. These pools differ from other ephemeral island habitats such as carrion, fallen fruit, sap flows, mushrooms and dung in their high degree of spatial predictability. Most pools are predictably inhabited by either C. imicola or C. pulcher. This finding is considered in the light of contemporary competition theory. 3. An arrangement whereby the same species repeatedly invades the same temporary habitat indicates that there is something about the habitat itself causing the discrimination. I suggest that degree of exposure to sunlight may provide a cue allowing females to discriminate between pools as oviposition sites. 4. Both species survive the long dry season by retreating to pools of river water left by receding livers. Dispersal to rain-pools by emerging adults occur during the following season with C. imicola occupying rain-pools remote from shaded rivers. Appropriately, measured against C. pulcher, the biology of C. imicola is that of a colonizing species. 5. The possibility is discussed that the chironomids in rock-pools do not survive to breed. Instead, these populations may be maintained externally, for exmaple by invasions from breeding populations in the Great Lakes of Africa, where larval densities may be too low to be detected by sampling. The evolutionary implications of such a situation are considered.																			0307-6946	1365-2311				MAY	1988	13	2					185	193		10.1111/j.1365-2311.1988.tb00346.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.1988.tb00346.x													WOS:A1988N485600007

Special emphasis was placed on nutrient cycling at the sediment-water interface and on the self-purification capacity of the lakes in the Danube Delta. In order to estimate the nutrient uptake of selected lakes we present in this paper the results of water analyses, benthic flux chamber experiments and deck incubation experiments of N-15-labeled sediment cores at the inflow and the outlet of the lakes. The external input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and silica into the lakes decreases with increasing distance to the main Danube branches whereas the total dissolved phosphorus input is independent of the hydrological distance to the main branches. The nutrient loading is highest in the inflow channels, and decreases towards the outflow of the lakes. In June, the uptake of NO3-, TDP and Si(OH)(4) in the lakes was higher than in September. In contrast, NH4+ uptake was more intense in September, when benthic release was more intense as well. On average, about 76% of the external plus internal nitrogen and phosphorus input into the lakes was taken up by macrophytes and phytoplankton during the growing season, whereas the uptake of external nutrient input amounted to about 43%. The benthic release of ammonia and silica increases from June to September and indicates, that part of the nutrients taken up during the growing season might be released during winter. We estimate the net impact of the Delta on the nutrient reduction of the Danube during the growing season is about 4.3%, assuming 10% of the Danube water is flowing through the Delta.					; Friedrich, Jana/AAG-4840-2021; Wehrli, Bernhard/A-4406-2013	Steingruber, Sandra Martina/0000-0001-8860-8421; Secrieru, Dan/0000-0002-0931-8440; Wehrli, Bernhard/0000-0001-7029-1972													0168-2563					JUL	2003	64	3					373	398		10.1023/A:1024944023408	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024944023408													WOS:000184414800005

Social-Ecological Institutional Fit in Volunteer-Based Organizations: A Study of Lake Management Organizations in Vilas County, Wisconsin, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS												How do the social and ecological attributes of social-ecological systems enable outcomes of those systems? The high concentration of lake organizations in northern USA enables us to study social, institutional, and ecological attributes that correlate with performance of common pool resource governance-institutional fit. In the summer of 2019, we performed an in-depth comparative study of thirty-one lake organizations in Vilas County, Wisconsin using data collected through semi-structured interviews, websites, and agency databases. We systematically compared the cases using crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis, specifically analyzing how the eight Ostrom institutional design principles lead to different outcomes for the lake social-ecological systems. The Ostrom institutional design principles played an important role in SES governance outcomes where there was low-resource dependence. We found that different combinations of design principles, social, and ecological conditions led to the same lake SES outcomes-equifinality. Although we expected that there were no panaceas for lake governance, we were surprised by the high diversity in organizational goals and the relative low diversity of rules in use.

This ephemeral saline lake is characterized by pH as low as 1.6 salinity as high as 32% total dissolved solids, and unusually complex geochemistry, including extremely high concentrations of aluminum, silica, and iron. We examined the microbial composition and putative function in this extreme acid brine environment by analyzing lake water, groundwater, and sediment samples collected during the austral summer near peak evapoconcentration. Our results reveal that the lake water metagenome, surprisingly, was comprised of mostly eukaryote sequences, particularly fungi and to a lesser extent, green algae. Groundwater and sediment samples were dominated by acidophilic Firmicutes, with eukaryotic community members only detected at low abundances. The lake water bacterial community was less diverse than that in groundwater and sediment, and was overwhelmingly represented by a single OTU affiliated with Salinisphaera. Pathways associated with halotolerance were found in the metagenomes, as were genes associated with biosynthesis of protective carotenoids. During periods of complete desiccation of the lake, we hypothesize that dormancy and entrapment in fluid inclusions in halite crystals may increase long-term survival, leading to the resilience of complex eukaryotes in this extreme environment.																			1431-0651	1433-4909				MAY	2018	22	3					367	379		10.1007/s00792-018-1000-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-018-1000-4								29350297					WOS:000428048800004

Three third-order sequences lasting in total ca. 10.6 m.y., and an internal lowstand systems tract (LST), transgressive systems tract (TST), highstand systems tract (HST), and falling-stage systems tract (FSST) have been identified. A series of sequence-specific paleogeographic maps have been constructed based on the contours of lithological parameters. The paleogeographic units include alluvial fan-braided (meandering) fluvial plain, upper delta plain, lower delta plain, sub-aqueous delta, shore-shallow lake, and deep lake. The preferred sites of coal accumulation are interdelta bays, upper delta plains, lower delta plains, and fluvial back swamps The sequence stratigraphic and sedimentological analysis of the Middle Jurassic coal-bearing measures of the Yuqia coalfield provides a basis for a comprehensive coal accumulation model that involves a six-period evolution from the LST, early TST, late TST, early HST, late HST to FSST. The major coal seams were accumulated in the early and late TST of the sequences S1 and S2. These results are of practical significance for coal resources exploration and enhance geological effects of prospecting engineering in the northern Qaidam Basin.

The history of vegetation types inferred from n-C-27/n-C-31 and average chain length of n-alkanes indicates the paleovegetation went through several distinct stages, consistent with pollen records from the study area. Compound-specific carbon isotope composition was also determined for C-27, C-29 and C-31 n-alkanes in the Qingshi core sediments. The relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 plants was calculated using a binary model and indicates that C-3 plants were the dominant input during the last glacial and Holocene. There were, however, shifts in the ratio of C-3 to C-4 vegetation abundance that correspond to changes in climate conditions. Generally, the long-term trend towards greater C-4 plant abundance from the last glacial to Holocene correlated with an increase in pCO(2), higher temperature, greater precipitation and more growing season precipitation. Our results suggest that temperature and seasonality of precipitation played a strong role in altering the relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 plants in the study area. These results provide information for predicting future vegetation changes in response to on-going global warming.

Influence of resource selection on nonbreeding season mortality of mallards	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Relationships between individual resource selection strategies and fitness are difficult to quantify at large spatial scales. These links are important for understanding the potential effects of management on population-level processes. We modeled the degree to which selection of specific landscape features altered mortality risk of female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) during the non-breeding season. We used individual resource selection estimates from adult female mallards equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) backpack transmitters (n = 56) in the Lake St. Clair region of southwestern Ontario, Canada, in August of 2014 and 2015. We determined the fate of individuals between August and January and used time-to-event analyses to model survival over 158 days. Furthermore, we investigated how diurnal and nocturnal resource selection and year were related to mortality risk. The survival rate for the adult female mallards was 0.57 (95% CI = 0.42-0.77). Resource types were combinations of land class types (e.g., water, marsh, flooded agriculture, supplemental feeding areas, and dry agriculture) important to mallards and varying levels of risk from anthropogenic disturbance ranging from inviolate refuges to publicly accessed areas where we predicted mortality risk to be greatest. Our results suggest that water that the public can access (i.e., public water) influenced mortality risk during multiple seasons. Specifically, selection of public water by female mallards reduced mortality risk diurnally during the non-hunting period (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.48-0.96) but increased mortality risk during the first half of the hunting period (hazard ratio = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.08-2.20). Our research highlights that individual selection strategies by ducks within this landscape can influence mortality risk.					; Schummer, Michael/FDB-4240-2022	Palumbo, Matthew/0000-0002-0195-1612; Schummer, Michael/0000-0002-6917-9542; 													0022-541X	1937-2817				SEP	2022	86	7							e22292	10.1002/jwmg.22292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22292		JUL 2022											WOS:000827282100001
J	SMITH, RIL				SMITH, RIL			DESTRUCTION OF ANTARCTIC TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS BY A RAPIDLY INCREASING FUR-SEAL POPULATION	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The terrestrial environment of Signay Island, South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctic, is undergoing rapid and possibly irreversible change caused by a natural biological agent. During the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the number of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella coming a shore on the island during the short summers. It is not known whether significant numbers of seals were present on the island prior to the initiation of commerical hunting in the early 1820s. The impact that the continuing increase of these seals had made on the island''s terrestrial and freshwater environments has been sudden and locally devastating. The fragile cryptogam-dominated vegetation has suffered physical damage from which it may be impossible to recover. These seals are also frequenting several of the islands''s freshwater lakes which are becoming increasingly eutrophic. The long-term implications of this impact are causing serious concern for the future of the lowland terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems on Signy Island if the fur seal population continues to increase.																			0006-3207	1873-2917					1988	45	1					55	72		10.1016/0006-3207(88)90052-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(88)90052-3													WOS:A1988N693500005

It is shown that the latitude and longitude do not change stochastically with time, but have regular cyclical components. Velocity of drift of the GMP has been estimated.

A research example of this progress can be demonstrated by the measurement campaigns that were mounted in Lake Trichonis, in central Greece. Numerical simulations and analytical theories have been tested against currents, surface seiche and temperatures. Simultaneous water gauges, current meters, anemometric stations, thermometers, sediment and water samplers were used for the verification of the model. The agreement between the theoretically predicted and experimentally determined data was satisfactory for most of the verifications. The most significant error was due to atmospheric pressure. The computed surface seiche showed excellent agreement with the observations, even in spectral analysis. The computed currents showed circulation patterns very similar to those measured in the field. The computed temperature distributions throughout the lake were not in good agreement because of incoming water from the bottom. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using palaeolimnological methods, we investigated the subfossil chironomid remains in surface sediments from a data set of 98 lakes from nine subregions of the European part of Northern Russia. We identified 143 chironomid taxa in the investigated lakes. Multivariate statistical analyses of chironomid and environmental data demonstrated that the mean July air temperature (T July), distance from the tree line, water depth, pH, and altitude explain the most significant variance in chironomid distribution. T July appeared to be the most important environmental variable. We established a chironomid-based inference model for reconstructing T July from subfossil data.

Environmental conditions for phytoplankton influenced carbon dynamics in boreal lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in lake water, and thus CO2 emissions from lakes are controlled by hydrologic inorganic carbon inputs into lakes, and in-lake carbon transformation (mainly organic carbon mineralization and CO2 uptake by primary producers). In boreal lakes, CO2 uptake by phytoplankton is often considered to be of minor importance. At present, however, it is not known in which and how many boreal lakes phytoplankton CO2 uptake has a sizeable influence on the lake water pCO(2). Using water physico-chemical and phytoplankton data from 126 widely spread Swedish lakes from 1992 to 2012, we found that pCO(2) was negatively related to phytoplankton carbon in lakes in which the phytoplankton share in TOC (C-phyto:TOC ratio) exceeded 5%. Total phosphorus concentration (TP) was the strongest predictor of spatial variation in the C-phyto:TOC ratio, where C-phyto:TOC ratios>5% occurred in lakes with TP>30 mu gl(-1). These lakes were located in the hemi-boreal zone of central and southern Sweden. We conclude that during summer, phytoplankton CO2 uptake can reduce the pCO(2) not only in warm eutrophic lakes, but also in relatively nutrient poor hemi-boreal lakes.					; Drakare, Stina/D-4532-2016; Drakare, Stina/ABF-1259-2020; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019	Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; Drakare, Stina/0000-0002-7389-2105; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2019	81	2							35	10.1007/s00027-019-0631-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-019-0631-6													WOS:000461138400001

Intrinsic brain tolerance to hypoxia in vertebrates	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												Many vertebrates are challenged by either chronic or acute episodes of low oxygen availability in their natural environments. Brain function is especially vulnerable to the effects of hypoxia and can be irreversibly impaired by even brief periods of low oxygen supply. This review describes recent research on physiological mechanisms that have evolved in certain vertebrate species to cope with brain hypoxia. Four model systems are considered: freshwater turtles that can survive for months trapped in frozen-over lakes, arctic ground squirrels that respire at extremely low rates during winter hibernation, seals and whales that undertake breath-hold dives lasting minutes to hours, and naked mole-rats that live in crowded burrows completely underground for their entire lives. These species exhibit remarkable specializations of brain physiology that adapt them for acute or chronic episodes of hypoxia. These specializations may be reactive in nature, involving modifications to the catastrophic sequelae of oxygen deprivation that occur in non-tolerant species, or preparatory in nature, preventing the activation of those sequelae altogether. Better understanding of the mechanisms used by these hypoxia-tolerant vertebrates will increase appreciation of how nervous systems are adapted for life in specific ecological niches as well as inform advances in therapy for neurological conditions such as stroke					Larson, John/JQW-4626-2023; Drew, Kelly/B-7995-2013														0022-0949	1477-9145				APR	2014	217	7					1024	1039		10.1242/jeb.085381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.085381								24671961					WOS:000333908500010

J	Guelda, DL; Koch, RW; Jack, JD; Bukaveckas, PA				Guelda, DL; Koch, RW; Jack, JD; Bukaveckas, PA			Experimental evidence for density-dependent effects and the importance of algal production in determining population growth rates of riverine zooplankton	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Food limitation effects on life history traits of lake zooplankton have been well documented but few studies have examined linkages between population growth rates and food resources in riverine environments. In rivers, allochthonous inputs of particulate organic matter may mitigate food limitation effects allowing density-independent mechanisms associated with washout (discharge) and feeding interference (turbidity) to assume greater importance. We experimentally manipulated densities of commonly occurring riverine zooplankton (Bosmina longirostris and cyclopoid copepods) within 20001 mesocosms containing ambient or algal-enriched food resources. The experiment was repeated through time (July, August, September) to represent the range of zooplankton densities and food resource levels observed in the Ohio River during warm-water, low-flow conditions. High growth rates and low sensitivity to density-dependent effects were observed during July when particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll concentrations were highest. Lower growth rates and stronger response to density-dependent effects were observed during August and September experiments when POC and chlorophyll concentrations were lower. Direct manipulations of algal abundance resulted in higher growth rates when gains in chlorophyll were accompanied by increases in the edible size fraction (September experiment). Algal C concentrations were found to be a significant predictor of variation in population growth rates for Bosmina but not cyclopoids. Algal C concentrations in the Ohio River rarely fell below experimentally derived minimum food thresholds but were often below saturation thresholds suggesting that population growth rates were constrained by autochthonous food resources despite the prevalence of allochthonous carbon.

J	KERMAN, BR; MEREU, RF				KERMAN, BR; MEREU, RF			WIND-INDUCED MICROSEISMS FROM LAKE-ONTARIO	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												The characteristics of microseisms measured in four vaults of the Southern Ontario Seismic Network within 30 km of the shore of Lake Ontario are analysed It is shown that the rms values in the 1-3 Hz band are coherent between the stations, indicating a common generative mechanism. A distinct onshore intermittent flux of Rayleigh-like wave energy was detected at a site near the shore. Microseismic energy in this band is distinctly correlated with the wind speed. The incremental microseismic energy above an absolute minimum activity as a function of wind direction, for a given fixed wind speed, correlates with the average fetch of the wind over the lake, indicating that the source of microseisms is the lake itself. The sensitivity to fetch effects is similar for both onshore and offshore stations indicating that shoaling is probably not a source. Niagara Falls, which also can have a wind-dependent flow from Lake Erie, causes a measurable effect to at least 25 km but does not significantly affect stations at a distance of 150 km.																			0705-5900	1480-9214				DEC	1993	31	4					501	516		10.1080/07055900.1993.9649483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.1993.9649483													WOS:A1993MT39000006

Total Hg and methylmercury dynamics in a river-floodplain system in the Western Amazon: Influence of seasonality, organic matter and physical and chemical parameters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Total mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) circulation in a connected river-floodplain system composed of two black water (a small forest river, igarape, and Cunia Lake) and a white water body (Madeira River), located in the Madeira River Basin were evaluated during the rising-water, early and late falling-water periods. We assessed organic matter (C and N composition, (C: N) a; and delta C-13 isotopic signature), and physical and chemical influences (pH, dissolved O-2, electric conductivity) in relationship to Hg and MeHg concentrations. Hg and MeHg concentrations in a sediment profile and three aquatic macrophytes (E. crassipes, E. azuera and Oryza sp.) were measured. Igarape and Cunia Lake showed higher Hg and MeHg concentrations (115-709; 10-25 ng g(-1)) in the suspended particulate matter compared (SPM) compared to the Madeira River (Hg: 5-16; MeHg: 0.2-0.3 ng g(-1)), partially independent of seasonality (p = 0.06). Total Hg had higher affinity for the SPM(1.75 times) than for dissolved organic matter. Organic matter characteristics correlated with MeHg concentrations (delta C-13 and (C: N) a; r(2) = 0.79; p < 0.0001), as well as physical and chemical parameters of the water column (dissolved O-2 and pH; r(2) = 0.80; p < 0.0001), demonstrating that physical and chemical changes between the river-floodplain system affect MeHg circulation and production. The inverse correlation of MeHg and SO42- concentrations (r(2) = 0.73; p < 0.0001) suggests the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Total Hg and MeHg concentrations as well as % MeHg were detected in the sediment profile (Hg: 24-51; MeHg: 0.6-3.2 ng g(-1); % MeHg: 1.8-6.2) and aquatic macrophytes (Hg: 1-30; MeHg: 0.3-7.5 ng g(-1); % MeHg: 1.6-33.7). We conclude that the highest Hg and MeHg concentrations in Cunia Lake, compared to the Madeira River, are due to the physical and chemical differences between these environments.

J	Harris, SA				Harris, SA			Causes and consequences of rapid thermokarst development in permafrost or glacial terrain	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Comparison of the temperatures at 50 cm depth in Fox Lake, Yukon Territory, with those at 10 cm depth in the soil on an adjacent lithalsa indicates that water absorbs between five and seven times as much solar energy as the soil on an annual basis. This is partly due to the differences in thermal properties between ice, water, soil and rock, but is also due to the water being translucent, and absorbing solar energy through a much thicker layer. Movements of water also help in the process. In winter, the soil cools down to -16 degreesC whereas the lake ice remains warmer than - 3degreesC. This is the reason that a thaw pond, once formed, will go on enlarging in icy materials until it runs out of ground ice or intersects a drainage way. Since thermokarst can be initiated by a variety of different agencies, a single occurrence cannot be used as a proof of climatic change.

We tested the hypothesis that this diet difference would have a significant impact on their pyloric caecal morphology in 5 lakes containing allopatric brook charr populations and 6 other lakes containing both brook charr and white sucker. We observed that the mean length of the most posterior caecum of charr was significantly greater in sympatry than in allopatry (XBAR +/- 1 SD: 9.91 +/- 1.12 mm versus 8.44 +/- 0.67 mm). This is equivalent to an increase of 18% of total pyloric caecal mass (dry weight) in sympatric brook charr. These results indicate that this response to differences in diet, well known in birds, also occurs in fish.					stevens, don/AAI-6983-2021; Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019; Stevens, Ernest/G-9569-2014	Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163; Stevens, Ernest/0000-0002-3113-1543													0378-1909					FEB	1993	36	2					205	210		10.1007/BF00002800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002800													WOS:A1993KM55800011

Data on PCNs in marine environment are scarce. In this study, 19 air samples were collected during a cruise in the equatorial Indian Ocean on board the Chinese research vessel Shiyan I from 4/2011 to 5/2011. PCN concentration of these air samples ranged from 0.033 to 2.56 pg m(-3), with an average of 0.518 pg m(-3), equal to or lower than the values reported for other oceans, seas, and lakes worldwide. Tri- and tetra-CNs were the main homologues in most samples. Remission of Halowax mixtures and incineration processes were the major sources of atmospheric PCNs in the study area. The PCN-corresponding toxic equivalency values ranged from 0 to 0.190 fg m(-3) (average: 0.038 fg m(-3)), falling in the low end of global range. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tellervo			Environment may be the source of Flavobacterium columnare outbreaks at fish farms	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Flavobacterium columnare, causing columnaris disease, was isolated for the first time from free water and biofilms in the environment outside fish farms. Fourteen isolates were found from Central Finland from a river by a water intake of a salmonid farm and 400 m upstream of the farm. One isolate was from a lake not under the influence of any fish farming. The bacterium could not be isolated from five other lakes in Central Finland or from three lakes in Eastern Finland, none of them in use for fish farming. Among the environmental isolates there was both genetic variability and difference in virulence, but the isolates were less virulent than the isolates originating from a disease outbreak at a fish farm. The isolates were able to survive for months outside the fish host and also to change their colony morphology, a phenomenon probably used as a survival strategy for F. columnare. This indicates that waters upstream of fish farms are a potential source of columnaris outbreaks at the farms during the summer. The results support the hypothesis that fish farms and farming practices may select for the virulent strains of F. columnare occurring in environmental waters to cause the infections at the farms.

Site activities were suspended in June due to migration activities, Afterwards the decline began again, and by mid September the Granite/Kimberlite interface was intercepted. The exploration of the intrusions, which form JD-01, was a vindication for all parties involved, as actual conditions necessitated little modification of original specifications. The project advanced in Six discreet areas within the four facies which comprise the pipe complex. By November 1996 the 15,000 tonne bulk sample was complete, tear down underground and fixing a portal door was completed in early December.

J	Usui, S; Kanou, K; Sano, M				Usui, Seiji; Kanou, Kouki; Sano, Mitsuhiko			Food habits of fishes in a freshwater reed belt in Lake Kitaura, eastern Japan, in summer	FISHERIES SCIENCE												The diets and feeding guild structure of a freshwater reed belt fish assemblage (30 species) were examined in Lake Kitaura, part of the Lake Kasumigaura system, eastern Japan, from June to September in 2009 and 2010. Ontogenetic dietary shifts were recognized in 14 species, including several species (e.g., Cyprinus carpio, Tridentiger brevispinis and Hyporhamphus intermedius) targeted by local fisheries. Juveniles of these species generally fed on zooplankton, later switching to other prey items (e.g., benthic chironomid larvae, gammaridean amphipods, shrimps, juvenile fishes, diatoms and decomposing reeds) with growth. A cluster analysis based on dietary overlaps showed that the reed belt fish assemblage comprised five feeding guilds (plant, zooplankton, benthic invertebrate, terrestrial insect and fish feeders). Of these, zooplankton feeders were the most abundantly represented in terms of species numbers, suggesting that the main food items for the fish assemblage were zooplankton (e.g., cladocerans, and calanoid and cyclopoid copepods). Fish feeders included five species, of which one was an alien species introduced from another region in Japan (Opsariichthys uncirostris) and three were from foreign countries (Micropterus salmoides, Lepomis macrochirus macrochirus and Ictalurus punctatus).																			0919-9268	1444-2906				MAY	2018	84	3					469	476		10.1007/s12562-018-1189-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-018-1189-2													WOS:000431509600007

Highly significant (R-2 = 0.93-0.95) relationships were found between absorbance coefficients (K-a lambda) and DOC within the UV-A and UV-B range (310, 320, 365 nm). Changes in UV absorbance with water depth were assessed in a subset of four lakes. Two study lakes with intermediate levels of DOC (DOC = 1.0-2.5 mg L-1) showed very marked depth related absorbance profiles, with evidence of photodegradation and much reduced absorbance in surface waters, particularly evident in late summer. These changes may affect complexation of metals and UV habitat characteristics for sensitive biota. These findings suggest that UV absorbance is an important variable for inclusion in long-term monitoring programs.

In this stratum, high HNAN numbers (> 30 .times. 106 HNAN liter-1) coincided with high bacterial activity. Assuming a conversion factor of 2 .times. 1018 bacteria mol-1 thymidine, we estimated a maximal bacterial production of about 4 .times. 109 bacteria liter-1 d-1 from thymidine incorporation. In the upper metalimnion (5-6-m depth) we found a low bacterial activity (estimated production 1 .times. 108 bacteria liter-1 d-1) and low HNAN numbers (3 .times. 106 HNAN liter-1). HNAN seem to be a link in the food web between bacteria and cyanobacteria on the one hand and ciliates on the other. Grazing experiments with selectively filtered lake water idicated ingestion rates of about 7 bacteria HNAN-1 h-1. We calculated that the HNAN are able to consume the entire bacterial production even at high bacterial growth rates.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	1989	34	2					297	309		10.4319/lo.1989.34.2.0297	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1989.34.2.0297													WOS:A1989U538800003

Therefore, high-frequency (every 3 days) monitoring and highresolution (100 sites) surveying of the algal biomass were performed during the summer of 2018-2020 to explore rainfall effects on algal growth and its associated mechanism in Xin'anjiang Reservoir, a large, deep, and oligotrophic reservoir in the subtropical region of China. The results showed that, in the short-term, rainfall inhibited algal growth in the river zone, while promoted algal growth in the lake zone. Path analysis (PLS-PM) and correlation analysis revealed that rainfall inhibited algal growth in the river zone by increasing discharge and decreasing light availability (turbidity) and water temperature, while promoted algal growth in the lake zone by increasing the nutrient concentrations, especially for phosphorus. In addition, we found that the stronger the rainfall is, the wider regions of the reservoir it impacted. Monthly observations at 100 sites showed substantial increases in both algal biomass (mean Chla concentration doubled) and nutrients concentrations in almost the whole reservoir after rainstorm events in Xin'anjiang Reservoir, indicating that rainstorm-induced nutrient pulsing loading could trigger algal blooms in oligotrophic reservoirs in the long-term. Extreme weather events are predicted to occur more frequently as the global climate changes in the future, and oligotrophic reservoirs are facing a greater risk of algal blooms.					; Xiao, Man/N-2972-2014; xiao, man/N-2972-2014; xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Shi, Pengcheng/LGZ-1138-2024	, Zou/0000-0001-9697-5168; Xiao, Man/0000-0003-0021-2129; Guangwei, Zhu/0000-0002-6718-8576													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2023	622		A						129711	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129711	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129711		MAY 2023											WOS:001011654200001

Core from the Rybnica Le & sacute;na PIG 1 borehole, which penetrated the Lower Anthracosia Shales, was analysed to explore the influence of climate on the evolution of the palaeolake, as distinct from tectonic and volcanic forcing. This reconstruction was made using mineralogical and geochemical proxies (elemental and mineralogical composition, TOC values, presence of framboidal pyrite and siderite). Based on the results, three chemically different intervals previously introduced by Wojcik-Tabol et al. (2021) are described. They represent the following stages of lake evolution: transgression (interval I), open lake (interval IIA and IIB), and termination (interval IIC and III). The initial stage of the lake (interval I) was probably related to a rise in humidity in the Late Pennsylvanian, linked to a southern Gondwana interglacial episode. Interval IIA represents the deepest facies of the Anthracosia Basin, where lake-floor anoxia prevailed. This stage was followed by a gradual lake-level fall recorded in interval IIB, with documented seasonality in humid and warm conditions. Interval IIC represents a stepwise lake regression attributed to aridification, as indicated by proxies showing a decrease in chemical weathering. Turbiditic sandy laminae in interval III reflect the terminal stage of lake infill.

However, such datasets can be very valuable for engineering design, improving environmental prediction tools or detecting change. This dataset documents physiographic, hydrometeorological and hydrological conditions in the Baker Creek Research Watershed from 2003 to 2016. Baker Creek drains water from 155 km(2) of subarctic Canadian Shield terrain in Canada's Northwest Territories. half-hourly hydrometeorological data were collected each year, at least from April to October, from representative locations, including exposed Precambrian bedrock ridges, peatlands, open black spruce forest and lakes. Hydrometeorological data include radiation fluxes, rainfall, temperature, humidity, winds, barometric pressure and turbulent energy fluxes. Terrestrial sites were monitored for ground temperature and soil moisture. Spring maximum snowpack water equivalent, depth and density data are included. Daily streamflow data are available for a series of nested watersheds ranging in size from 9 to 128 km(2). These data are unique in this remote region and provide scientific and engineering communities with an opportunity to advance understanding of geophysical processes and improve infrastructure resiliency.

Diets of all species colelcted were dominated by rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax; 67% by number) and alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus; 29%). Although predator and prey lengths had significant positive regressions, the strength of the relationships r2 < 0.05) indicated little selection of prey by length. Number of prey per stomach ranged from 0 to 79, but most predators contained less than 5 prey. Alewife abundance in the diet decreased significantly over summer, with a concomitant increase in rainbow smelt consumption. The ratio of alewives to rainbow smelt also varied with year. Diet of salmonines from western Lake Huron was quite different from that in other Great Lakes, particularly in the preponderance of rainbow smelt and in low overall diversity. I suggest that stocking rates and other regulations should consider lake differences in management of trout and salmon populations.																			0380-1330						1990	16	2					271	278		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71420-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71420-7													WOS:A1990DL43700008

Nature has provided a number of water resources such as surface water for instance rivers, lakes, springs, ground water and so on. By artificial means, man has created water storage systems such as excavated dams, check dams, reservoirs, tanks etc., to meet the basic water requirements throughout the year. But ever-growing population and poor water management skills of individuals have driven the globe towards serious water crisis. Solar distillation fills the gap between water scarcity and water productivity and remains one of the simplest methods of producing pure drinking water. Though many models in solar stills are being used across the globe, tilted wick type still excels with outstanding performance in the production of pure water. In this review, an attempt has been made in particular to study the factors that are involved in increasing the performance of tilted wick type solar distillation stills. This review covered the initiatives taken from the year 1985 being the first initiative in tilted wick type model to final tilted wick model on 2020 based on published articles.					; Subramaniam, Umashankar/B-9343-2017; Kasinathan, Padmanathan/N-2951-2017; GOPALSWAMY, MAHESWARAN/AAD-2975-2021; Alavandar, Srinivasan/C-1132-2008; Ravi, Rajesh/ISV-0459-2023; Rajagopal, Maheswar/I-7936-2019; V, Manikandan/R-3225-2019; Raju, Ganesh/R-5279-2019	RAVI, RAJESH/0000-0001-5359-8761; Rajagopal, Maheswar/0000-0001-7977-4751; GOPALSWAMY, MAHESWARAN/0000-0001-9258-7280; Venkatraman, Manikandan/0000-0003-4882-2663													0038-092X	1471-1257				JUN	2021	221						348	374		10.1016/j.solener.2021.04.048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2021.04.048		MAY 2021											WOS:000656664000007

This model, previously tested in the same study area against the Palmer Z-index, is run at monthly scale for the current scenario of land uses and under three scenarios that combine the land abandonment and the application of the new common agricultural policy (CAP) of the European Union. Under the current conditions, runoff yield is scarce and presents a high spatial variability when monthly rainfall intensity and depth are low, and infiltration processes mainly lead to water storage in the soil. When rainfall intensity is high, runoff accumulation along the hillslopes controls the depth of available water in the soil, and SMS is more homogeneous. On average, scrublands and pasture have the wettest values, crops of winter cereal and abandoned fields have intermediate conditions, and areas of bare soil and forest have the driest conditions all the year around. The abandonment and no revegetation of the low productive fields located in steep areas and the collapse of their landscape linear elements (LLEs) produce not only an increase of 2.3 % of the overall SMS in the catchment in comparison with the current scenario but also an increment of the effective runoff that cross the cultivated areas of the lowlands and the runoff depth that reach the wetlands, increasing the soil erosion risk and compromising the conservation of the lakes. When the new green areas of the CAP are installed in the upper part of the fields of the lowlands and around the lakes, the runoff depth and thus siltation risk clearly decreases but also SMS decreases 1.7 and 1.1 % considering the current land uses and adding revegetation practices in the abandoned fields, respectively. Hence, a management scenario where: (1) abandoned fields are covered with a dense cover of shrubs, (2) the LLEs are preserved, (3) the green areas of the PAC are created, and (4) runoff harvesting practices are applied to partially compensate the water deficit, will help to preserve the humidity of the soil and will be of interest to keep the agricultural land use around the protected lakes of the study area.

J	Kann, J; Welch, EB				Kann, J; Welch, EB			Wind control on water quality in shallow, hypereutrophic Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Large blooms of cyanobacteria, primarily Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, are linked to poor water quality in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. High pH and high un-ionized ammonia concentrations are associated with the blooms when algae are actively growing, followed by low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions when the blooms decline in mid- to late summer. Over a 12-year study period, algal biomass was strongly related to total phosphorus concentration (TP) and pH. Minimum water column DO was strongly related to net negative changes (i.e., declines) in algal biomass during July and August. The severity of both low DO and high ammonia was positively related to water column stability, which was dependent on wind speed. Bloom dynamics, coupled with climate, dominated year-to-year variability in water quality dynamics in Upper Klamath Lake. These data provide the empirical basis for previous research linking high mortalities of endangered sucker species with years of low wind and high water column stability.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUN	2005	21	2					149	158		10.1080/07438140509354424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140509354424													WOS:000230369900004
J	MATVEEV, V				MATVEEV, V			THE DYNAMICS AND RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BOTTOM-UP VS TOP-DOWN IMPACTS IN A COMMUNITY OF SUBTROPICAL LAKE PLANKTON	OIKOS												By analysis of a previously described system consisting of three trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and an invertebrate predator in a eutrophic lake), the generality of two hypotheses of food web theory was tested. (1) Top-down (predator-on-prey) impact weakens down the food web. (2) Time lags in the trophic level interactions decrease in duration from top to bottom of food webs. In the lake studied, a spring pulse of phytoplankton impacted with a delay the biomass of upper trophic levels - herbivorous zooplankton and the predatory water mite, Piona sp. Later in the season, the top-down control by Piona cascading down the food web became prevailing over bottom-up forces. Cross-correlations revealed that the top-down effect was not weakening downwards. Instead, the impact of zooplankton biomass on phytoplankton biomass was stronger than that of the invertebrate predator on zooplankton, despite the fact that the predator caused a decline in zooplankton biomass. Contrary to the theory, the time lags did not differ significantly between the impacts of trophic levels of a given pathway direction. However, they differed between bottom-up vs top-down pathways in support of the theory. Thus, some predictions of the food web theory may be restricted only to fish-impacted systems for which it was originally developed. An alternative explanation could be that the strength of top-down impact is associated with the width of consumers' feeding niches: the impact is stronger when niches are wider.

The aim of our research was to provide data on the steppe zooplankton community in a large-scale regional study. Therefore, a baseline survey was carried out in 23 shallow inland waters of different salinity in Northern Kazakhstan. We measured the quantity and identified the taxonomic composition of zooplankton in the spring period and examined changes in community structure in correlation with salinity. Lesser salt concentration of the hyposaline-mesosaline waters was indicated by the presence of halophilic rotifer species: Brachionus asplanchnoides, Br. dimidiatus, Br. plicatilis. Mesosaline and hypersaline waters were indicated by the presence of halobiont crustaceans: Moina salina, Arctodiaptomus salinus, Cletocamptus retrogressus. Very high concentration of salt was indicated by presence of Artemia alone which is the only group, that can tolerate and adapt to this extreme environment. In the hypersaline waterbodies at over 79 gL(-1) high TDS conditions a very simple tropical structure was found. Artemia playing monopolistic ecological function in the zooplankton community. We identified three characteristic groups of shallow inland saline waters based on their zooplankton composition.

To assess the implications of a severe drought in Finland, we carried out a national scale drought impact analysis. Firstly, we simulated water levels and discharges during the severe drought of 1939-1942 (the reference drought) in present-day Finland with a hydrological model. Secondly, we estimated how climate change would alter droughts. Thirdly, we assessed the impact of drought on key water use sectors, with a focus on hydropower and water supply. The results indicate that the long-lasting reference drought caused the discharges to decrease at most by 80% compared to the average annual minimum discharges. The water levels generally fell to the lowest levels in the largest lakes in Central and South-Eastern Finland. Climate change scenarios project on average a small decrease in the lowest water levels during droughts. Severe drought would have a significant impact on water-related sectors, reducing water supply and hydropower production. In this way drought is a risk multiplier for the water-energy-food security nexus. We suggest that the resilience to droughts could be improved with region-specific drought management plans and by including droughts in existing regional preparedness exercises.					; Keskinen, Marko/B-2886-2012; Veijalainen, Noora/AAN-4826-2020; Marttunen, Mika/G-3134-2019	Belinskij, Antti/0000-0003-4441-7580; Ahopelto, Lauri/0000-0003-1619-8800; Veijalainen, Noora/0000-0003-4665-933X; Keskinen, Marko/0000-0001-5236-2327; 														2071-1050				APR 2	2019	11	8							2450	10.3390/su11082450	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11082450													WOS:000467752200263

Towards improved objective analysis of lake surface water temperature in a NWP model: preliminary assessment of statistical properties	TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Information about the statistical structure of the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) field is needed for assimilation of lake observations into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, to describe the lake surface state at each grid-point containing lakes. In this study, we obtain the autocorrelation function for LSWT from two types of observations, in situ and satellite-based. We use summer time measurements during 2010-2014 over selected Fennoscandian lakes and Northern European domain. The estimated autocorrelations decrease exponentially (from 0.99 to 0.73 for in situ and from 0.97 to 0.61 for satellite observations), when the distance between observations increases from zero to one thousand kilometres. A large difference in lake depth leads to a decrease of the correlation. Typical error standard deviation of LSWT observations was found to be 0.9 degrees C for in situ observations and 1.2 degrees C for satellite observations. The exponential approximation for the LSWT autocorrelation functions is proposed, which depends on both the distance and the difference in lake depth. These results are directly applicable for the LSWT objective analysis in NWP. New autocorrelation functions, which allow interpolation of observations within and between lakes, were used in numerical experiments with the High-Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM). In this preliminary assessment, we suggest adaptation of the presently used functions by increasing the influence radius and taking into account the lake depth difference. Generalization of the results to cover the melting and freezing seasons, their assessment for different geographical areas as well as their application to other prognostic lake variables within NWP are foreseen.

However, E. coli does not provide enough information to determine fecal source or public health risk. The stsudy objective was to determine factors influencing the presence of E. coli and host-specific markers (HSM) from upstream to downstream in Beaver Lake Reservoir (BLR). From February 2014 to September 2015, 420 base flow and rain event samples were collected from seven sites-two sites from streams (White River [WR] and War Eagle Creek) draining into BLR and five sites from within BLR. Each sample was analyzed for E. coli and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for HSM related to human, bovine, and poultry. The data indicate that overall levels of E. coli were significantly greater in the WR and significantly lower at the most downstream sampling location in BLR. Escherichia coli is more likely present during spring (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.86), at the WR sampling site (aOR = 3.39), or during a rain event (aOR = 2.73). Moreover, the HSM HumM2 is more likely present (aOR = 1.99) when E. coli is present. These same factors were associated with E. coli concentrations >126 most probable number 100 mL(-1) (aOR = 2.76-12.48), except the poultry marker CL was more likely associated (aOR = 3.81) than HumM2. This study revealed that both seasonal and locational factors are important variables for fecal pollution in BLR. Moreover, these same factors may apply to fecal pollution in manmade reservoirs within similar types of watersheds across the United States, as well as internationally.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1048	1056		10.2134/jeq2017.03.0105	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2017.03.0105								28991970					WOS:000411433900014

Fifty species (one to eleven per lake) were recorded, including eighteen endemic and seven alien species. We investigated which local geo-climatic and other environmental variables shaped the fish assemblages. Altitude and temperature turned out to be the most important factors for total species richness as well as richness of omnivorous and zooplanktivorous species and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, with more species and higher diversity occurring in the warmer lowland lakes. Altitude may affect the fish assemblage directly through dispersal limitation or indirectly by creating a gradient in temperature with which it was strongly correlated. Cyprinidae was the most species-rich and widespread family. Atherinidae, Gobiidae, and Mugilidae (families of marine origin) were mainly found in the lowland regions, while Salmonidae exclusively appeared in the high-altitude lakes. The presence of widely distributed translocated native and alien species revealed a large human impact on the fish assemblages, potentially threatening the rich endemic fish fauna in lakes in this region.					; beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; Tavşanoğlu, Ülkü/AGK-9942-2022; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Özuluğ, Müfit/AAC-4685-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019	OZULUG, MUFIT/0000-0002-1437-3890; Tavsanoglu, Ulku Nihan/0000-0001-8462-415X; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Bezirci, Gizem/0000-0002-0634-0327; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2016	771	1					31	44		10.1007/s10750-015-2608-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2608-3													WOS:000372798500004

Analysis of summer (July-August) zooplankton data demonstrates a decline in rotifer species abundance and richness at all study sites. Long-term patterns show a shift in zooplankton community composition from dominance by rotifers, to increased densities of cyclopoids in the late 1990's. Between 1994 and 1997 rotifer species richness had declined by 5-9 species at all study sites. Some rotifer taxa (Synchaeta spp., Filinia spp., and Lecane spp.) have not been observed at any study site since 1996. Rotifer species composition has shifted from taxa indicative of eutrophic conditions to those, characteristic of oligotrophic waters. Coincidental with the shift in community composition is the introduction and proliferation of zebra mussels into Lake Champlain in the mid 1990's. Possible zebra mussel mediated effects or other causes for the observed community shifts are discussed.																					0-306-48469-2				2004							259	270																WOS:000224236900014

Summer habitat use of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in a small Arctic lake, monitored by acoustic telemetry	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Acoustic technologies were applied to describe how landlocked Arctic char from Iqalugaajuruluit Lake, Baffin Island, interact with its lacustrine habitat. Acoustic data from the lake bottom was collected using sonar equipment and substrate types were verified with benthic grabs and mapped in a geographic information system. Arctic char movements during the open water period were recorded from char fitted with acoustic tags. The distribution of the tagged Arctic char in Iqalugaajuruluit Lake was dependent on fish size and related to abiotic factors such as depth, substrate type and depth/temperature, temporally. The volume of water with temperatures below 6 degrees C during the open water period may be a limiting factor for large char (> 400 mm) in small Arctic lakes. The large piscivorous char are found most often in the deepest water over soft substrates and the smaller char which feed on varying proportions of invertebrates and fish were found most often over the more complex substrates such as boulders, pebbles and gravel.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				MAR	2009	18	1					117	125		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00330.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2008.00330.x													WOS:000263451300014

Most studies have examined resource partitioning between two native species or between a native species and one that has been introduced. In this study we examine the diel feeding ecology and habitat use of three species of juvenile salmonids (i.e., Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar, Brown Trout Salmo trutta, and Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) in a tributary of Skaneateles Lake, New York. Subyearling Brown Trout and Rainbow Trout fed more heavily from the drift than the benthos, whereas subyearling Atlantic Salmon fed more from the benthos than either species of trout. Feeding activity of Atlantic Salmon and Rainbow Trout was similar, with both species increasing feeding at dusk, whereas Brown Trout had no discernable feeding peak or trough. Habitat availability was important in determining site-specific habitat use by juvenile salmonids. Habitat selection was greater during the day than at night. The intrastream, diel, intraspecific, and interspecific variation we observed in salmonid habitat use in Grout Brook illustrates the difficulty of acquiring habitat use information for widespread management applications.

Our study was conducted in the upper reaches of the basin, where the Selenge river and its tributaries flow through the Mongolian forest-steppe. Monthly and maximum runoff, precipitation, and air temperature data from 12 gauging stations collected between 1978 and 2015 were analyzed to characterize the hydrological regime response to climate change. Concomitant with rising temperatures and increased potential evaporation, river runoff in the Mongolian part of the Selenge basin has decreased from the first interval (1978-1995) of our study period compared with the consecutive interval from 1996 to 2015. The decrease in runoff throughout the study area was most likely caused by an increase in potential evapotranspiration (and not reduced precipitation or land use changes) for both summer rainfall- and snowmelt-dominated rivers. Annual maximum runoff has also strongly decreased suggesting that reduced flooding is a contemporary threat for Mongolia's riverine ecosystems, probably causing the replacement of wetland and mesic habitats.

The sediment of the lake was densely inhabited by the filter-feeding bivalve Corbicula japonica. An overlying water sampler showed that PON at the sediment-water interface (less than a few millimeters above the sediment) was not depleted; nevertheless, active uptake of PON by C. japonica (10.4 mg-atoms N m(-2) d(-1)) is reported. Dissolved and particulate N species showed vertically uniform profiles at night, which we attributed to nocturnal water mixing associated with cooling surface water. These observations suggest benthic-pelagic coupling between filter-feeding bivalves and phytoplankton which enables the removal of nitrogen from the eutrophic lake through fisheries yield of bivalves.

However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and migration mechanisms of microbial communities in such environments remain unclear. Here, we investigated the composition and migration of the microbial communities at the ice-water-sediment interfaces of Daihai Lake (high salinity) and Ulansuhai Lake (low salinity) in Inner Mongolia, China. The changes in microbial communities under varying salinity conditions were analysed and potential pathogenic genera with implications for fish and other aquatic animals were identified. Ice and water were dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, whereas sediments mainly contained Chloroflexi and Nitrospirota. Additionally, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests and linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis were conducted to detect significant differences in microbial abundance. Significant seasonal and site-specific variations in indicator genera were observed in the sediments. Sulfuroxidising bacteria, such as Thioalkalispira-Sulfurivermis and Thiobacillus, were predominant in the summer. The indicator genus at point D1 was Thiobacillus, while the indicator genus at point D2 was Bacillus. Furthermore, the microbial migration efficiency was substantially lower in high-salinity lakes (sediment-to-water body: 9.8 %; water body-to-ice: 15.9 %) than in low-salinity lakes (sediment-to-water body: 27.1 %; water body-to-ice: 22.7 %). Seven pathogenic genera were identified in the saline lake, which could affect fish health and cause acute gastrointestinal inflammation in humans upon consumption. This study will allow us to fully understand the compositional characteristics of microbial species under different salinities and provide valuable information for subsequent saline lake management. In particular, it has important practical applications in water quality monitoring and ecological restoration.					yu, xuezheng/LZI-4153-2025; Han, Yunping/JPX-6846-2023														1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2025	171								113232	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113232		FEB 2025											WOS:001427632900001
J	Paltan, H; Dash, J; Edwards, M				Paltan, Homero; Dash, Jadu; Edwards, Mary			A refined mapping of Arctic lakes using Landsat imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Effective mapping of water bodies at regional scales is a challenge with respect to the description and monitoring of hydrological, climatic, and landscape processes. In a region as sensitive to climate change as the Arctic, inaccurate representation of lake cover has probably led to underestimation of the role of lakes as landscape constituents and thus of their contribution to biochemical cycles. To estimate lake cover reliably (and perhaps also its change through time), the scientific community necessitates techniques for mapping water bodies using satellite sensors that include rich historical data sets and have sufficiently fine spatial resolution. Here we applied a density-slicing detection technique to 617 cloud-free Landsat images for the summer months 2006-2011. We developed a comprehensive database of Arctic lakes with a detection accuracy of 80% and examined spatial patterns of lake distribution in relation to landscape properties. We mapped about 3,500,000 lakes; these cover nearly 6% of the Arctic land surface (about 400,000 km(2)) and are typically small (<0.1 km(2)). Lake density and lake fraction analyses show that lakes are most common in lowland permafrost areas with tundra vegetation. The method described here can also be used to map and monitor lake cover at regional to hemispheric scales and to monitor changes in lake cover over time.

River otter scat was collected from latrines to identify prey at the Emiquon Preserve and the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge located along the Illinois River near Havana and Lewistown in Fulton County, Illinois. Remains of prey from dissected scats were compared to osteological resources to taxonomically identify the remains. Fish were present in 85.4% of the dissected samples. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were the most common fish preyed upon during the study, occurring in 69.8% of all dissected samples. Crayfish were present in 77.1% of samples. Amphibians, insects, filamentous algae, green-winged teal (Anas crecca) or blue-winged teal (A. discors), and muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) were also consumed. The minimum number of individuals (MNI) consumed was also determined based on the prey remains present. The results of a two-tailed Fisher's exact test demonstrated there were significant differences in the percentage of prey consumed by otters at Emiquon and in previous studies conducted in Whiteside County, Illinois, and Alberta, Canada.

Partial least squares for efficient models of fecal indicator bacteria on Great Lakes beaches	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												At public beaches, it is now common to mitigate the impact of water-borne pathogens by posting a swimmer's advisory when the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) exceeds an action threshold. Since culturing the bacteria delays public notification when dangerous conditions exist, regression models are sometimes used to predict the FIB concentration based on readily-available environmental measurements. It is hard to know which environmental parameters are relevant to predicting FIB concentration, and the parameters are usually correlated, which can hurt the predictive power of a regression model. Here the method of partial least squares (PLS) is introduced to automate the regression modeling process. Model selection is reduced to the process of setting a tuning parameter to control the decision threshold that separates predicted exceedances of the standard from predicted non-exceedances. The method is validated by application to four Great Lakes beaches during the summer of 2010. Performance of the PLS models compares favorably to that of the existing state-of-the-art regression models at these four sites. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, when applied to spatial or spatio-temporal data, advanced solutions are required to go beyond pruning over single attributes and towards multidimensional pruning. Even though there exist solutions for geospatial data, such as GeoParquet and SpatialParquet, they fall short when applied to trajectory data (sequences of spatio-temporal positions). In this paper, we propose TrajParquet, a format for columnar storage of trajectory data, which is highly efficient and scalable. Also, we present a query processing algorithm that supports spatio-temporal range queries over TrajParquet. We evaluate TrajParquet using real-world data sets and in comparison with extensions of GeoParquet and SpatialParquet, suitable for handling spatio-temporal data.					; Nanni, Mirco/ACV-7966-2022; Perego, Raffaele/O-5821-2015; Renso, Chiara/M-9515-2015	Doulkeridis, Christos/0000-0002-3219-0510; Renso, Chiara/0000-0002-1763-2966; Nanni, Mirco/0000-0003-3534-4332; Koutroumanis, Nikolaos/0000-0003-3457-3045; Perego, Raffaele/0000-0001-7189-4724; 															979-8-4007-0168-9				2023							416	419		10.1145/3589132.3625623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3589132.3625623													WOS:001156830400073

Plateau-scale investigations of these components and their respective light absorption are limited due to the high altitude. In this study, we combined the analysis of major light-absorbing substances and their corresponding multiwavelength absorption to determine their specific contributions firstly. We investigated the spatial variations of total suspended particle (TSP) mass across the HTP, noting high contributions from dust, carbonaceous components, and secondary inorganic aerosols (SNA, including sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium). Enhanced levels of primary and secondary OC and SNA were observed in the marginal areas of the HTP, associated with high relative humidity (RH) and OX levels (O-3+NO2). EC was the primary contributor to light absorption, accounting for approximately 68%, 46%, and 64% in Ngari, Qinghai Lake, and Beiluhe, respectively. We found higher light-absorbing contributions from carbonaceous aerosols in the marginal areas compared to the central HTP site, particularly during the heating seasons (similar to 90%). Fugitive dust significantly contributed to TSP mass but not to light absorption. The concurrent constraints on the mass and optical properties of OC, EC, and dust in this study can help reduce uncertainties in climate models specific to the HTP.

To assess the possibility that this alga uses bacteria as a substitutable P source via phagotrophy, feeding experiments were conducted using bacteria-sized fluorescent microspheres as tracer particles. The experiments revealed that the ingestion rate of U. americana on the food particles (bacteria + microspheres) is significantly affected by the concentrations of phosphate as well as food particles in the lake water. The response of ingestion rate to phosphate concentration indicated that P levels greater than or equal to 0.4 mu M P were enough to reduce bacterivory by this alga. However, phosphate concentration had no effect on ingestion rate in heterotrophic nanoflagellates. These results suggest that U, americana can utilize bacteria as a substitutable P source. Such an ability favors the development and maintenance of dense blooms by this alga under P-limited conditions.

J	Hatt, RT				Hatt, RT			Relation of the meadow mouse Microtus p. pennsylvanicus to the biota of a Lake Champlain Island	ECOLOGY												A pair of adult mice and 5 equal aged juveniles of this species were the only vertebrates occurring on Sloop Island, Lake Champlain, New York, in Sept., 1926. The vegetated area of the island was confined to 120 sq. yards at the summit of the rocks. Here the mice were feeding principally upon Verbascum thapsus, Poa pratensis, P. annua, and the basal leaves of a Solidago sp. The island presented a very closely cropped appearance. Several species of invertebrates were common, though they are not known to have been utilized as food. One nest was found. Open runways connected the covered passages of the rock crevices. It is improbable that all of these mice could find food enough on the island to last through the winter, or even until the ice on the lake permitted their escape or their destruction by a foraging carnivore.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1928	9						88	93		10.2307/1929545	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929545													WOS:000200148200010

Human modifications of land cover include building reservoirs and thus creating artificial lakes for multipurpose use. In this research, the authors have completed a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model-based assessment of impacts of two large parallel lakes on precipitation. This area is located in the western part of the states of Kentucky and Tennessee and known as the Land between the Lakes (LBL). To determine the impacts, this study has replaced the lakes with grass, deciduous forests, and bare soil and conducted model simulations for three precipitation events of different magnitudes. The analysis suggests that precipitation increased in some cases and reduced in others. One of the key impacts of LULCC in the LBL area is the relocation of precipitation cells and also the timing of precipitation. Local precipitation amounts increased or decreased with these relocations. In summary, establishment of lakes or replacement of lakes with alternate land cover may modify local precipitation in the LBL area.						, Eric/0000-0002-8966-7076													1087-3562					SEP	2017	21						1	31		10.1175/EI-D-16-0016.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/EI-D-16-0016.1													WOS:000410788100001

Connecting past and present climate variability to the water levels of Lakes Michigan and Huron	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The water levels of Lakes Michigan and Huron have been monitored since 1865, and numerous attempts have since been made to connect their variations to potentially predictable large-scale climate modes. In the present study, the levels are analyzed after outflow-related damping effects were removed, increasing the transparency of the lake level fluctuations and potential climate connections. This filtering exposes a large oscillation which is connected to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and a similar to 27-yr periodicity that is likely resulting from the intermodulation of two near-decadal cycles originating in the North Atlantic region. While the lake level fluctuations prior to 1980 were predominately driven by changes in precipitation, it is now found that for the first time in our years of record, evaporation has begun to significantly contribute to lake level changes. Summertime evaporation rates have more than doubled since 1980 as a result of increasing water-surface temperatures, which are significantly correlated with decreasing wintertime ice cover.

These cherts appear to have formed by a combination of early diagenetic silicification of calcareous layers and permineralization of noncalcareous layers deposited in a very shallow subtidal or lower intertidal setting on a carbonate platform. The preserved assemblage is largely or entirely of cyanophytic affinity with coccoid forms dominating over filamentous forms. Many elements of this microbiota are morphologically similar to the 1900 Ma old Belcher Islands assemblage and 850 Ma old Bitter Springs assemblage.

J	Ford, TD; Pedley, HM				Ford, TD; Pedley, HM			A review of tufa and travertine deposits of the world	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												A general review of the nature and classification of tufas is presented and the available literature is summarised. An attempt is made to standardise the terminology currently in use and to distinguish clearly between ambient temperature deposits (tufas), thermal deposits (travertines) and speleothems. Consideration is also presented of the physico-chemical and biological processes, often acting together, which are responsible for the precipitation of freshwater calcium carbonate within tufa systems. These processes appear to be climatically controlled. Therefore, tufas may be of value in palaeo-environmental reconstruction, especially if intercalated with peaty material. While the majority of tufa deposits are of post-glacial age some of the most spectacular carbonate precipitates are thermal travertines. The second part of the paper deals with a world-wide survey of the principal deposits of tufa and travertine. Space prevents a fuller account of the European deposits and the reader is referred to Pentecost (1995) for a wide range of specific examples from Europe and Asia Minor.																			0012-8252					NOV	1996	41	3-4					117	175		10.1016/S0012-8252(96)00030-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0012-8252(96)00030-X													WOS:A1996VX94200001

The overall regression was interrupted by two minor transgressions during the late Younger Dryas and in early Preboreal, and these were probably caused by a combination of expansions of local ice caps and readvances of the Icelandic inland ice-sheer margin. Maximum absolute uplift rates are recorded during the regressional phase between the two transgressions (10 000-9850 BP), with a mean value of c. 15 cm . C-14 yr(-1) or 11-12 cm . cal. yr(-1). Mean absolute uplift during the regressional phase following the second transgression (9700-9100 BP) was around 6 cm .

Here we studied brain tissues from gulls at five Great Lakes colonies and one non-Great Lakes colony during spring of 2001 and 2003. Total brain Hg concentrations ranged from 0.14 to 2.0 mu g/g (dry weight) with a mean of 0.54 mu g/g. Gulls from Scotch Bonnet Island, on the easternmost edge of the Great Lakes, had significantly higher brain Hg than other colonies. No association was found between brain Hg concentration and [3H]-ligand binding to neurochemical receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartate, muscarinic cholinergic, nicotinic cholinergic) or nicotinic receptor alpha-7 relative mRNA expression as previously documented in other wildlife. In conclusion, spatial trends in Hg contamination exist in herring gulls across the Great Lakes basin, and herring gulls accumulate brain Hg but not at levels associated with sub-clinical neurochemical alterations.

J	Porst, G; Irvine, K				Porst, Gwendolin; Irvine, Kenneth			Implications of the spatial variability of macroinvertebrate communities for monitoring of ephemeral lakes. An example from turloughs	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Turloughs, ephemeral water bodies associated with karstified limestone, are an important habitat found in the West of Ireland. They are a priority habitat under the European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and are groundwater-dependent habitats under the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC; WFD). Sampling to meet the objectives of either Directive requires discrimination of inherent natural variation from anthropogenically induced disturbances and accounting for both spatial and seasonal patterns of biotic distribution. This study reports within- (submerged grassland) and between-habitat (submerged and emergent grassland) variability of macroinvertebrate communities in six turloughs. Two different habitat types were sampled from two turloughs in April 2007, and further assessment of spatial pattern in commonly found submerged grassland habitat was determined from four additional turloughs in spring 2008. While cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling identified differences in macroinvertebrate community structures between habitats in one out of two turloughs, congruence of invertebrate communities was, nevertheless, greater within than among turloughs. Within-habitat variability of macroinvertebrate communities across sampling locations of submerged grassland habitat was sufficiently low so that samples collected at any location of a turlough can provide a reliable metric of the macroinvertebrate community of a turlough as a whole. A standardized submerged grassland sampling approach for routine turlough sampling is recommended as a pressure response method to fulfil the requirements of the WFD. For a comprehensive conservation assessment, however, as demanded under the EC Habitats Directive, we suggest a multi-habitat sampling approach to obtain a thorough assessment of turlough macroinvertebrate biodiversity.

J	Hatch, LK; Reuter, JE; Goldman, CR				Hatch, LK; Reuter, JE; Goldman, CR			Stream phosphorus transport in the Lake Tahoe basin, 1989-1996	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Lake Tahoe is undergoing the initial stages of cultural eutrophication due to human alteration of the airshed and watershed. The lake's switch from nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) limitation has been attributed primarily to atmospheric N loading. This places an increased importance on controlling watershed movement of P to the lake. A stream water quality monitoring data set consisting of nine streams in the Lake Tahoe basin has been analyzed to characterize the spatiotemporal variation of P delivery to the lake. This data is from the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP), which provides scientific data for planning and regulatory agencies to address environmental problems in the Lake Tahoe basin. Results indicate that P delivery (concentrations, loads) varies greatly at interannual, seasonal, and spatial scales. Annual and seasonal total P (TP) concentrations can vary up to three orders of magnitude in a given stream and are strongly associated with suspended sediment. Particulate P is the major form of P transported by Tahoe streams and was strongly correlated with percent surficial geologic deposits, which are primarily located near streams. Tahoe streams with the highest annual P concentrations often had the lowest annual P loads, and visa versa. P loading is greatest during the spring snowmelt (75% of annual average). Potential watershed parameters influencing P delivery to Lake Tahoe have been identified as precipitation, basin area, basin steepness, and road and human development coverage. Results also suggest that human development impacts on stream P loads are most prevalent during high precipitation years. Identification and quantification of stream sediment and P sources such as streambanks and impervious surface is necessary to aid in watershed restoration efforts.																			0167-6369					JUN	2001	69	1					63	83		10.1023/A:1010752628576	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1010752628576								11393545					WOS:000168199000005
J	Angel, JR; Isard, SA				Angel, JR; Isard, SA			The frequency and intensity of Great Lake cyclones	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Cyclones are an important feature of the Great Lakes region that can have important impacts on shipping, lake temperature profiles, ice cover, and shoreline property damages. The objective of this research is to analyze the frequency and intensity of cyclones that traversed the Great Lakes region, the changes of these characteristics since 1900, the interrelationship of cyclone frequency and intensity, and their relationships to circulation patterns and regional temperature and precipitation. Significant increases in the number of strong (less than or equal to 992 mb) cyclones over the twentieth century were found for the annual, cold season, November, and December time periods. In contrast, the frequency of all cyclones in the annual and warm season time series and the central pressure of all cyclones in the annual, cold, and warm season time series displayed significant decreases from 1900 to 1939. Relationships between cyclone frequency and intensity and between cyclone and anticyclone frequency and intensity suggest that there is a partial compensation within the region. As the number of cyclones increases, their intensity decreases, As the number of cyclones increases, so does the number of anticyclones. And, finally, as the cyclones become stronger, so do the anticyclones. Comparisons with the Pacific-North American teleconnection index indicate that lower (higher) cyclone frequency is associated with more zonal (meridional) how. Comparisons of cyclone characteristics with temperature and precipitation in the Great Lakes region shows that cyclone frequency is inversely related to temperature and directly related to precipitation in most month and season categories. In contrast, the relationships between cyclone intensity and climate variables are inconsistent.

J	Coleman, NM; Dinwiddie, CL; Baker, VR				Coleman, Neil M.; Dinwiddie, Cynthia L.; Baker, Victor R.			Evidence that floodwaters filled and overflowed Capri Chasma, Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Erosional features on a plateau in the Valles Marineris provide evidence that a lake filled Capri Chasma until it overflowed its eastern rim, carving two large spillover channels. The floodwaters surged into the adjacent lowlands of ancestral Ganges Chasma and eastern Eos Chasma. The channel floor elevation and depth of incision at Daga Vallis reveal that a 1200-m-deep lake water column was drained by the flooding. The width, depth, and steep energy slope ( similar to 0.02) of Daga Vallis and the existence of several cataracts, including a 500-m-high dry falls, demonstrate the power of the floodwaters. We estimate a possible peak discharge rate of 1 - 6 x 10(8) m(3) . s(-1). The catastrophic flows may have been triggered by the collapse of topographic barriers in eastern Coprates Chasma, providing a gateway for lake waters in the central Valles Marineris to pour eastward toward Capri Chasma and the lowlands beyond. These may have been among the earliest flows in Simud-Tiu Valles, contributing discharge to a possible sea in the northern plains of Mars.

An Assessment of Potential Severe Droughts in the Colorado River Basin	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Much has been learned about Colorado River hydrology since the severe sustained drought study in 1995. We summarize our updated understanding of plausible future drought conditions by considering historical flows, tree-ring reconstructions, and climate change. We focus on natural streamflow at Lees Ferry, the primary metric used to quantify the runoff in the Colorado River Basin. We identify drought periods using historical records and tree-ring reconstructed streamflow at Lees Ferry, which we then use to characterize potential future droughts. Resampling from past drought periods generates plausible future conditions to consider during planning. We produced three drought scenarios, each comprising 100 streamflow sequences to be used as input to systems operation and management models. We used analysis of the duration-severity and cumulative deficit relative to the mean natural flow to evaluate droughts and drought simulations and show that the current millennium drought that started in 2000 has an average flow far less than the historical record. However, the flows reconstructed from tree rings or future flows projected from climate models indicate that even more severe droughts are possible. When used as input to the Colorado River Simulation System the drought scenarios developed indicate considerable periods when Lake Powell falls below its hydropower penstocks, indicating a need to rethink management and operation of these reservoirs during these critical conditions.					; Tarboton, David/G-8972-2011; Wheeler, Kevin/GSD-3621-2022	Salehabadi, Homa/0000-0003-3516-4462; Tarboton, David/0000-0002-1998-3479; Udall, Bradley/0000-0002-9691-1735; Schmidt, John C/0000-0002-2988-3869													1093-474X	1752-1688				DEC	2022	58	6					1053	1075		10.1111/1752-1688.13061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.13061		SEP 2022											WOS:000853818100001

We compared the effect of exudates of the exponential growth phase of Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz. Elenk with exudates during the decline phase on seedlings of the macrophyte species Potamogeton crispus L. Biomass, chlorophyll content, the ratio of variable-maximum fluorescence (F-v/F-m), and light response capacity of P. crispus seedings were significantly inhibited when affected by M. aeruginosa exudates of the exponential growth phase but promoted by exudates of the decline phase. Tiller numbers of P. crispus increased by 350% under the influence of exponential phase exudates, but decreased by 60% when decline phase exudates were applied. Both exudates increased the malondialdehyde contents and decreased the activity of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase in P. crispus seedlings. We conclude that the exponential growth phase of cyanobacteria rather than the decline phase is important for disrupting photosynthesis and for inducing oxidative stress in submerged macrophytes. Planting P. crispus should thus not be applied in summer but during the cyanobacteria decline phase.

Precipitation and cold spring waters are considered to be the input and final product, respectively, of normal weathering. The concentrations of major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-) in these water and in geothermal water and steam were used to calculate the origins of the dissolved salts in each lake. Rhyolitic strata dominate most lake catchments, but in some the presence of andesite, basalt, or hydrothermal ejecta influences the major ion ratios in the fraction of the dissolved salts derived from weathering. Each of the 32 lakes studied was classified according to the origins of its lakewater dissolved salts and the effect on these salts of its catchment geology.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1986	20	2					173	183		10.1080/00288330.1986.9516141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1986.9516141													WOS:A1986D925900002

The flood of GSL in 1982 has caused a loss of millions of dollars. Therefore, it is very important to predict the GSL levels as precisely as possible. This paper points out the reason why conventional methods failed to describe adequately the rise and fall of the GSL levels - the long-range dependence (LRD) property. The LRD of GSL elevation time series is characterized by some most commonly used Hurst parameter estimation methods in this paper. Then, according to the revealed LRD, the autoregressive fractional integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model is applied to analyze the data and predict the future levels. We have shown that the prediction results has a better performance compared to the conventional ARMA models.

Effects of road de-icing salt (NaCl) on benthic respiration and nutrient fluxes in freshwater sediments	LIMNETICA												Winter road salt applications are increasing chloride concentrations in many freshwater ecosystems. This trend is alarming, giv-en chloride's potential to impair aquatic ecosystems. Short-and long-term exposure to salt could affect ecosystem metabolism and nutrient cycles. Here, we examine connections between chloride concentrations, water quality conditions, benthic respi-ration, and sediment-water nutrient flux throughout a large (722 km2) lake and its catchment. Aquatic locations experiencing high concentrations of chloride are indicators of anthropogenic activities and are often associated with additional pollutants. We used sediment core flow-through incubations under ambient and enriched chloride concentrations to determine the effects of road salt on benthic respiration and nutrient fluxes in stream, stormwater pond, and lake sites. Salt (as sodium chloride) ad-ditions caused a significant overall increase in benthic respiration. Acute exposure to road salt caused the strongest increase in benthic respiration when water was warm and at sites that had low (< 50 mg Cl-/L) or high (> 400 mg Cl-/L) ambient chloride concentrations or when water was cold and sites had intermediate (100-400 mg Cl-/L) ambient chloride concentrations. Nitrate flux responded less uniformly to salt additions. Depending on waterbody type and season, ambient nitrate flux into the sediment was similar, increased, or decreased post-chloride addition. Dissolved phosphorus flux was not significantly impacted by salt additions. Across lake and stream sites, our results supported the hypothesis that chloride causes increased respiration while nutrient cycles were weakly and inconsistently altered under experimental pulse road salt additions.

J	Shou-ning, H; Yi-cheng, F; Guang, L				Shou-ning, Hao; Yi-cheng, Fu; Guang, Li			The Relationship between Water Quality in the Niyang River During the Flood Season and Land Use at Different Spatial Scales	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												To examine the relationship between water quality in the Niyang River and its response to land use at varying spatial scales, we analyzed water quality data from seven monitoring stations along the main stem of the Niyang River. This study evaluated the current status of water quality and its correlation with land use structures within buffer zones at different scales, identifying the optimal buffer scale for assessing the impact of land use on water quality. The results indicate that the water quality of the Niyang River falls under Class III standards, with chemical oxygen demand (COD) being a key indicator of potential pollution risk. There is a significant correlation between specific water quality parameters and land use patterns across different buffer scales. Notably, the 3-kilometer buffer zone exhibits the highest explanatory power for spatial variability in water quality, making it the optimal scale for managing water quality in the Niyang River. Forest land within this buffer zone significantly influences COD and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations. This study underscores the importance of optimizing land use structure within the 3-kilometer buffer zone, particularly through strategic allocation of forested areas, to enhance pollutant retention and improve the overall water ecological environment of the Niyang River.																			1230-1485	2083-5906				2025 SEP 29	2025										10.15244/pjoes/205819	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/205819		SEP 2025											WOS:001587872600001

Our long-term influenza surveillance of poultry and migratory birds in southern China in the past 12 years showed that H10 influenza viruses have been introduced from migratory to domestic ducks over several winter seasons at sentinel duck farms at Poyang Lake, where domestic ducks share their water body with overwintering migratory birds. H10 viruses were never detected in terrestrial poultry in our survey areas until August 2013, when they were identified at live-poultry markets in Jiangxi. Since then, we have isolated 124 H10N8 or H10N6 viruses from chickens at local markets, revealing an ongoing outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis of H10 and related viruses showed that the chicken H10N8 viruses were generated through multiple reassortments between H10 and N8 viruses from domestic ducks and the enzootic chicken H9N2 viruses. These chicken reassortant viruses were highly similar to the human isolate, indicating that market chickens were the source of human infection. Recently, the H10 viruses further reassorted, apparently with H5N6 viruses, and generated an H10N6 variant. The emergence and prevalence of H10 viruses in chickens and the occurrence of human infections provide direct evidence of the threat from the current influenza ecosystem in China. IMPORTANCE After the outbreak of avian-origin H7N9 influenza viruses in China, fatal human infections with a novel H10N8 virus were reported. Utilizing data from 12 years of influenza surveillance in southern China, we showed that H10 viruses were regularly introduced by migratory ducks to domestic ducks on Poyang Lake, a major aggregative site of migratory birds in Asia. The H10 viruses were maintained and amplified in domestic ducks and then transmitted to chickens and reassorted with enzootic H9N2 viruses, leading to an outbreak and human infections at live-poultry markets. The emergence of the H10N8 virus, following a pathway similar to that of the recent H7N9 virus, highlights the role of domestic ducks and the current influenza ecosystem in China that facilitates influenza viruses moving from their reservoir hosts through the live-poultry system to cause severe consequences for public health.

Understanding impacts of organic contaminants from aquaculture on the marine environment using a chemical fate model	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												As demand for sustainable marine aquaculture (mariculture) and marine food supply surges worldwide, there is a growing need for new tools to assess mariculture impacts on local ecosystems, including the cycling of toxic organic contaminants. With this in mind, we developed the Contaminant Fate in Aquaculture-Modified Eco-systems (CFAME) model. The current model was designed to explore the fate of mariculture-derived organic contaminants in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, known for its Chinook salmon farming industry. Model evaluation indicated robust model design, with 80% of modeled concentrations falling within a factor of ten of measured ones for native biota. Model results showed that mariculture was a source of organic contaminants in the sediment even at the Marlborough Sounds regional level and in wild marine fishes with high trophic levels near the farm area. Future research attention should be directed toward measuring chemicals with low log KAW (<0) and high log KOW values (e.g., >3) in sediment, and chemicals with log KOW values of 3-9 in wild fish.					; Niu, Shan/GSI-9904-2022; Ng, Carla/F-6130-2011	McMullin, Rebecca/0000-0002-9346-7421; Chen, Ruiwen/0000-0002-8714-0043													0304-3894	1873-3336				FEB 5	2023	443		A						130090	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130090		OCT 2022						36279653					WOS:000880766700001

Analysis and simulation of nutrient retention and management for a lowland river-lake system	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In the context of the European Water Framework Directive, we studied the possible impact of reduced emissions on phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in a lowland river-lake system (Havel River, Germany). As a prerequisite, we quantified the retention of nutrients in the river from mass balances and deduced its seasonal variation. We detected that about 30% of the total nitrogen input is retained within the surveyed river section. In contrast, phosphorus release from sediments was shown to cause a considerable increase in present P concentrations. Average net phosphorus release rates of about 20 mg P m(-2) d(-1) in late summer were estimated for the Havel Lakes. Based on the observed patterns of N retention and P release we parametrized a newly developed water quality simulation program (TRAM), which allows alternative model approaches of different complexity to be implemented and tested. To account for the future trend of internal P loading, the phosphorus excess in lake sediments was estimated from core samples and included in the model as a state variable. For analyzing scenarios of reduced nutrient emissisions, the water quality simulation program was linked to mesoscale hydrological catchment models for the first time. From scenario simulations we conclude that internal P loading is likely to counteract efforts of emission control for decades. Even by significant reductions in external P loads, a persistent phosphorus limitation of primary production can hardly be established in the analyzed time frame of 13 years. Though in the short run a continued reduction in nitrogen loads appears to be the more promising approach of eutrophication management, we recommend enhanced efforts to diminish both N and P emissions.					; Bronstert, Axel/AAA-3314-2022	Kneis, David/0000-0002-6048-6984; Bronstert, Axel/0000-0002-6369-8536; 													1027-5606	1607-7938					2006	10	4					575	588		10.5194/hess-10-575-2006	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-10-575-2006													WOS:000241044900009

In lakes less than similar to 100 m deep, the main pathways for O-2 consumption were organic matter (OM) mineralization at the sediment surface and oxidation of reduced compounds diffusing up from the sediment. In deeper lakes, mineralization of OM transported through the water column to the sediment represented a greater proportion of O-2 consumption. This process predominated in the most productive lakes but declined with decreasing total phosphorous (TP) concentrations and hence primary production, when TP concentrations fell below a threshold value of similar to 10 mg P m(-3). Oxygen uptake by the sediment and the flux of reduced compounds from the sediment in these deep lakes were 7.9-10.6 and 0.6-3.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. These parameters did not depend on the lake's trophic state but did depend on sedimentation rates for the primarily allochthonous or already degraded OM. These results indicate that in lakes deeper than similar to 100 m, mineralization of autochthonous OM is mostly complete by the time of sedimentary burial. This explains why hypolimnetic O-2 concentrations improve more rapidly following TP load reduction in deeper lakes relative to shallower lakes, where larger sediment-based O-2 consumption by settled OM and release of reduced substances may inhibit the restoration of hypolimnetic O-2 concentrations.

J	Hannon, GE; Bradshaw, RHW; Wastegård, S				Hannon, GE; Bradshaw, RHW; Wastegård, S			Rapid vegetation change during the early Holocene in the Faroe Islands detected in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												High-resolution pollen, plant macrofossil and sedimentary analyses from early Holocene lacustrine sediments on the Faroe Islands have detected a significant vegetation perturbation suggesting a rapid change in climate between ca. 10380 cal. yr BP and the Saksunarvatn ash (10 240 +/- 60 cal. yr BP). This episode may be synchronous with the decline in delta(18)O values in the Greenland ice-cores. It also correlates with a short, cold event detected in marine cores from the North Atlantic that has been ascribed to a weakening of thernohaline circulation associated with the sudden drainage of Lake Agassiz into the northwest Atlantic, or, alternatively, a period with distinctly decreased solar forcing. The vegetation sequence begins at ca. 10 500 cal. yr BP with a succession from tundra to shrub-tundra and increasing lake productivity. Rapid population increases of aquatic plants suggest high summer temperatures between 10 450 and 10 380 cal. yr BP. High pollen percentages, concentrations and influx of Betula, Juniperus and Salix together with macrofossil leaves indicate shrub growth around the site during the initial phases of vegetation colonisation. Unstable conditions followed ca. 10 380 cal. yr BP that changed both the upland vegetation and the aquatic plant communities. A decrease in percentage values of shrub pollen is recorded, with replacement of both aquatics and herbaceous plants by pioneer plant communities. An increase in total pollen accumulation rates not seen in the concentration data suggests increased sediment delivery. The catchment changes are consistent with less seasonal, moister conditions. Subsequent climatic amelioration reinitiated a warmth-driven succession and catchment stabilisation, but retained high precipitation levels influencing the composition of the post-event communities.

J	Brock, MA; Rogers, KH				Brock, MA; Rogers, KH			The regeneration potential of the seed bank of an ephemeral floodplain in South Africa	AQUATIC BOTANY												Germination from the seed banks of ephemeral floodplain wetlands of the Nyl River in South Africa was quantified in a glasshouse experiment to examine the potential of the seed bank for revegetation. Sediments from three sites with different wetting and drying histories (permanent, seasonal and occasional inundation) were collected in late summer after flooding and germination but before the seed bank was replenished. Samples were flooded artificially after dry, wet or wet/dry pretreatment and germination was recorded. Samples were then dried and reflooded to assess germination from the residual seed bank. All sites had a species-rich germinable seed bank, The water regime history of each site did not influence the number of species or individuals present in any trial or pretreatment. More species and individuals germinated in the first germination trial than the second. Fewer species germinated from the samples collected from above the water line than from underwater Sixteen species (12 aquatic) and 1392 individuals germinated in the first trial. Most species from the field communities also germinated from the seed bank. Twelve species, including 2 new species, germinated from the residual seed bank. Many of the species from these wetlands have persistent seed banks with staggered germination of propagules. Species maintain themselves over space (sites), conditions (water regimes) and time (trials) by a range of life-cycle patterns. Wetland communities that depend on their seed banks for revegetation between wetting and drying events may be altered by human-induced changes to water regimes.

Recently, one of its few representatives, Gemmatimonas phototrophica, was found to contain purple bacterial photosynthetic reaction centres. However, almost nothing is known about the environmental distribution of phototrophic Gemmatimonadetes bacteria. To fill this gap, we took advantage of fast-growing public metagenomic databases and performed an extensive survey of metagenomes deposited into the NCBI's WGS database, the JGI's IMG webserver and the MG-RAST webserver. By employing Mg protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester oxidative cyclase (AcsF) as a marker gene, we identified 291 AcsF fragments (24-361 amino acids long) that are closely related to G.phototrophica from 161 metagenomes originating from various habitats, including air, river waters/sediment, estuarine waters, lake waters, biofilms, plant surfaces, intertidal sediment, soils, springs and wastewater treatment plants, but none from marine waters or sediment. Based on AcsF hit counts, phototrophic Gemmatimonadetes bacteria make up 0.4-11.9% of whole phototrophic microbial communities in these habitats. Unexpectedly, an almost complete 37.9kb long photosynthesis gene cluster with identical gene composition and arrangement to those in G.phototrophica was reconstructed from the Odense wastewater metagenome, only differing in a 7.2kb long non-photosynthesis-gene insert. These data suggest that phototrophic Gemmatimonadetes bacteria are much more widely distributed in the environment and exhibit a higher genetic diversity than previously thought.

J	Latulippe, N				Latulippe, Nicole			Restoring the river, restoring relations: on Anishinaabe artist Michael Belmore's stone series, Replenishment	CULTURAL GEOGRAPHIES												In his work and creative practice, Anishinaabe artist Michael Belmore shows that materials have language and rock tells a story. Belmore's land-based installation on Manitoulin Island, a three-part granite series titled, Replenishment, tells a story about place that is activated by relationship and reciprocity between people and with the Earth. It reinscribes Indigenous presence on the land, rewrites settler-colonial narratives about place, and broadens the scope and intent of ecological restoration. Drawing on my interactions with the artist and his work during the 2017 Manitoulin Island Summer Historical Institute, a field school on Anishinaabe history, I explore the circulation of knowledge and agency in an Anishinaabe world and consider relationship as essential to decolonizing geography's engagement with Indigenous peoples and territories. Through rock as mnemonic device, Belmore demonstrates the restorative power of subtle and not so subtle acts of interconnection and relationship.

J	Pérez, T; Mattar, C; Fuster, R				Perez, Tomas; Mattar, Cristian; Fuster, Rodrigo			Decrease in Snow Cover over the Aysen River Catchment in Patagonia, Chile	WATER												The evidence for global warming can be seen in various forms, such as glacier shrinkage, sea ice retreat, sea level rise and air temperature increases. The magnitude of these changes tends to be critical over pristine and extreme biomes. Chilean Patagonia is one of the most pristine and uninhabited regions in the world, home to some of the most important freshwater reservoirs as well as to evergreen forest, lakes and fiords. Furthermore, this region presents a sparse and weak network of ground stations which must be complemented with satellite information to determine trends on biophysical parameters. The main objective of this work is to present the first assessment on snow cover over the Aysen basin in Patagonia-Chile by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the period 2000-2016. The MOD10A2 product was processed at 500 x 500 m spatial resolution. The time-series analysis consisted in the application of non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope for annual and seasonal mean of snow covered area (SCA). Data from ground meteorological network and river discharges were also included in this work to show the trends in air temperature, precipitation and stream flow during the last decades. Results indicate that snow cover shows a decreasing non-significant trend in annual mean SCA with a -20.01 km(2)year(-1) slope, and neither seasonal mean shows statistical significance. The comparison with in situ data shows a seasonal decrease in stream flows and precipitation during summer. The hydrological year 2016 was the year with the most negative standardized joint anomalies in the period. However, the lack of in situ snow-monitoring stations in addition to the persistence of cloud cover over the basin can impact trends, creating some uncertainties in the data. Finally, this work provides an initial analysis of the possible impacts of global warming as seen by snow cover in Chilean Patagonia.

The distribution of MCs in the water column, and toxin bioaccumulations in aquatic organisms were surveyed. The results suggested that Lake Taihu is heavily polluted during summer months by toxic cyanobacterial blooms (with a maximum biovolume of 6.7 x 10(8) cells/L) and MCs. The maximum concentration of cell-bound toxins was 1.81 mg/g (DW) and the dissolved MCs reached a maximum level of 6.69 mu g/L. Dissolved MCs were always found in the entire water column at all sampling sites throughout the year. Our results emphasized the need for tracking MCs not only in the entire water column but also at the interface between water and sediment. Seasonal changes of MC concentrations in four species of hydrophytes (Eichhornic crassipes, Potamogeton maackianus, Alternanthera philoxeroides and Myriophyllum spicatum) ranged from 129 to 1317, 147 to 1534, 169 to 3945 and 124 to 956 ng/g (DW), respectively. Toxin accumulations in four aquatic species (Carassius auratus auratu, Macrobrachium nipponensis, Bellamya aeruginosa and Cristaria plicata) were also analyzed. Maximum toxin concentrations in the edible organs and non-edible visceral organs ranged from 378 to 730 and 754 to 3629 ng/g (DW), respectively. Based on field studies in Lake Taihu, risk assessments were carried out, taking into account the WHO guidelines and the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for MCs. Our findings suggest that the third largest lake in China poses serious health threats when serving as a source of drinking water and for recreational use. In addition, it is likely to be unsafe to consume aquatic species harvested in Lake Taihu due to the high-concentrations of accumulated MCs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A marked wet phase gave way to a Fall in lake levels during the late glacial. Dune emplacement was active at this time to the south of the Manga Grasslands, but seems to have been absent from the grasslands themselves. Wet conditions prevailed during much of the early to mid-Holocene, accompanied by periods of significant barchanoid dune reactivation. A marked deterioration in climate and vegetation commenced around 4.1 ka sp, leading to the formation of the present-day semi-arid landscape. The data suggest that there have been major changes in humidity in this part of Subsaharan West Africa during the late glacial to Holocene and that the relationship between changes in precipitation and aeolian activity is complex.																			0016-7649					MAR	1999	156		2				357	368		10.1144/gsjgs.156.2.0357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.156.2.0357													WOS:000079080500015

Consistent wine evaluations were made in 1971-1973 for ''Chancellor'' (Seibel 7053), ''Chelois'' (Seibel 10878), ''DeChaunac'' (Seibel 9549) and ''Landot 4511''. At least 4 cultivars can be grown commercially along the southern shore of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania and produce high-quality table wines with a vinifera-like character. ''Chancellor'' consistently produced a wine of excellent quality. Wines of ''DeChaunac'' and ''Chelois'' were of high quality, and musts of ''Landot 4511'' fermented into wines of acceptable quality. Average yield of fruit from vines of these 4 cultivars ranged 19.0 tonnes(t)/ha for ''Chelois'' to 15.3 t/ha for ''Landot 4511''. Soluble solids of the musts were lowest for ''DeChaunac'' (18.5%) and highest for ''Landot 4511'' (19.4%). Total acidity values, expressed as tartaric acid, were lowest for ''Landot 4511'' 0.90 g/100 g of must) and highest for ''Chancellor'' (1.13 g/100 g). Average vine vigor ranged from 0.6 kg of cane wood/vine for ''Chancellor'' to 1.7 kg/vine for ''Landot 4511''.																			0002-9254	1943-7749					1978	29	2					120	124																WOS:A1978FD85900009

They have bandwidths of 67nm, 78nm, 60 nm and 120 nm, respectively. The Hyperion spectral bandwidth of 10.2 nm results in 10 to 15 Hyperion spectral samples across each Landsat band in the VNIR. When the Hyperion spectral responses in the 10.2 nm bands are properly weighted to aggregate to a given Landsat band, the radiometric response of the Landsat band can be reproduced by Hyperion. This is done for Bands 2, 3 and 4 on the scene 7 of Lake Frome, Australia collected simultaneously by Hyperion and Landsat on January 21, 2001. The initial comparison of the radiances from Hyperion synthesized into the ETM+ bands with the Landsat-7 ETM+ radiances showed differences of 15-23%, with ETM+ being higher. Prior to launch a laboratory standard comparison showed differences of 10-13% in the same direction.

This species is considered one of the most active migrants from the northern waterbodies in the Volga reservoir cascade to the Volga delta. Here, we explored the ranges of the preferred and avoidance temperatures of C. kolensis from two geographically isolated populations. Thermal tolerance was measured in a thermogradient installation and compared to the temperatures at which members of these populations occurred in their source waterbodies. Temperature preference was determined using the "chronic" method. Individuals of C. kolensis possessed a bimodal final temperature preferendum of 2-6 degrees C and 13-21 degrees C, which corresponds to the optimal thermal conditions of the species in a pond. These ranges were the same for individuals of both populations irrespective of the geographical location and water temperature of their source waterbodies. The temperature range of normal performance was 2-4 to 21-25 degrees C, and the pessimal temperature ranges were from 1 - 2 to 3-4 degrees C and from 22-25 degrees C to 26-30 degrees C. These temperature ranges coincide with field observations over a recent 20-year period of temperature conditions under which the species develops in nature. Our results allow us to characterize C. kolensis as an ecologically plastic species, which, despite its strong association with the cold-water Complex species, is adapting to a wider temperature range as global warming occurs.

J	Pyle, DM				Pyle, DM			Widely dispersed Quaternary tephra in Africa	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Several prominent widespread Pleistocene tephra layers have been recognised and correlated across northern Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda. A single unit has been correlated between Lake Turkana and the Gulf of Aden. Each of these tephra units represents the products of an eruption of at least 4 km(3) of magma. The number of active volcanoes within the African rift valleys suggests that there should be an order of magnitude more widespread tephra layers than have yet been correlated. Further study of the short cores recovered from East African lakes and mire deposits, integrated with ongoing research on the young or active caldera volcanoes of the East African Rift, should yield many more marker tuffs from the Holocene and late Pleistocene. The prospects for developing a high-resolution record of rift volcanism for the past 40,000 years are very good. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	TUFESCU, MVA				TUFESCU, MVA			SEASONAL-VARIATION PATTERNS OF THE FISH COMMUNITY IN THE LITTORAL WATERS OF NORTHERN LAKE-ONTARIO, THE PICKERING-DARLINGTON AREA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The ecotone fish community of the littoral waters is a mixture of onshore migratory pelagian species and littoral species. It is characterized by high numeric and diversity variations produced under the effect of migrations, thermal perturbations and the local habitat variations. The sixty analyzed sampling units belong to five years of records, three seasons and three types of littoral habitats. The Kendall tau test identifies the seasonal variation as a significant criterion for sample classification. From the ecological view point it corresponds to phases of the thermal stratification. The start of the thermal stratification identifies the season of a highest pelagian onshore migration. The maximum thermal stratification shows the community structure at the end of a massive pelagian return. The late fall circulation describes the community structure prevailed by the local populations. The quantitative patterns were evaluated for each season based on a 95% confidence interval of the mean and on normalized weighed averages. A comparison of subsequent community structures allowed a species classification by the magnitude of their numeric variations. Regarding the analyses of the diversity variations, a new strategy was introduced based on independently derived indices of the community diversity. The strategy identifies two features: the seasonal models of the diversity variation and the abnormal cases. The models depict the trends/features of the diversity variations. The abnormal cases evaluate the local/temporal side effects.																			0018-8158					APR 22	1994	281	3					141	154		10.1007/BF00028677	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00028677													WOS:A1994NL94300002
J	Kost, MA; De Steven, D				Kost, MA; De Steven, D			Plant community responses to prescribed burning in Wisconsin sedge meadows	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												In northern temperate regions, sedge meadows dominated by the tussock-sedge Carex stricta Lam. (Cyperaceae) were historically a fire-maintained community type. In two Wisconsin natural areas (Lulu Lake and Summerton), we assessed the effects of time since prescribed spring burning on plant composition and aboveground biomass in eight sedge meadows representing a partial chronosequence of zero to seven years since burning, plus no burning. We recorded plant species cover in line-intercept transects and measured live biomass and litter in sample plots along transects. Responses were prominent during the first two pears after burning. In the Lulu Lake meadows, live biomass and annual forb cover reached their highest values during the first growing season after burning, whereas cover and frequency of perennial forbs were elevated for two seasons. Plant litter was removed by burning but returned to preburn levels in one to two years. In the Summerton meadows, where seven years had elapsed since the last fire, burned and unburned meadows did not differ in Live biomass, litter, or relative cover of plant life-forms. It appears that periodic burns do not cause major shifts in the relative dominance of sedges and grasses, which are long-lived clonal perennials. However, because litter removal promotes recruitment of shorter-lived forbs, prescribed fire can enhance sedge meadow diversity by allowing plant species with different life histories to temporarily share dominance with the more abundant graminoids. Periodic seed inputs by forbs to the wetland seed bank may be a desirable fire management objective for maintaining sedge meadow diversity.																			0885-8608	2162-4399				JAN	2000	20	1					36	45																WOS:000085019900005

Both events had potential to cause catastrophic flooding that would have disrupted lives of millions and induced significant economic losses. Fortunately, prompt action by local authorities supported by the deployment of a real-time landslide early warning system allowed for quick and safe construction of a spillway to drain the dammed lake. It averted the worst scenario without loss of life and property at least one order of magnitude less to what would have been observed without quick intervention. Particularly, the early warning system was able to predict the second large-scale slope failure 24h in advance, along with minor rock falls during the spillway construction, avoiding false alerts. This paper presents the main characteristics of both slope collapses and damming processes, and introduces the successful landslide early warning system. Furthermore, we found that the slope endured cumulative creeping displacements of >40m in the past decade before the first event. Twenty-five meter displacement occurred in the year immediately before. The deformation was measured by the visual interpretation of multitemporal satellite images, which agrees with the interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurement. If these had been done before the emergency, economic losses could have been reduced further. Therefore, our findings strengthen the case for the deployment of systematic monitoring of potential landslide sites by integrating earth observation methods (i.e., multitemporal satellite or UAV images) and in situ monitoring system as a way to reduce risk. It is expected that this success story can be replicated worldwide, contributing to make our society more resilient to landslide events.					; Ph.D., Andres/X-2521-2019; Fan, Xuanmei/C-5219-2015; Xu, Qiang/AAE-3255-2022; Siva Subramanian, Srikrishnan/O-6437-2017; Li, Weile/AAD-2385-2019; Subramanian, Srikrishnan/O-8753-2019	Li, Weile/0000-0002-3741-8801; Alonso-Rodriguez, Andres Felipe/0000-0002-6404-2192; Xu, Qiang/0009-0004-8413-5662; Siva Subramanian, Srikrishnan/0000-0003-4004-0894; 													1612-510X	1612-5118				MAY	2019	16	5					1003	1020		10.1007/s10346-019-01159-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-019-01159-x													WOS:000466495400010

East-west asymmetry in long-term trends of landfast ice thickness in the Hudson Bay region, Canada	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Ice cover in the Hudson Bay region (HBR) goes through a complete cryogenic cycle each year. Freeze-up typically occurs in October and November, ice cover reaches its peak thickness from late March to May, and water bodies in the HBR are usually ice-free beginning in early August. In this study, the timing and magnitude of the annual peak in ice thickness were identified for each year from weekly ice observations compiled by the Canadian Ice Service. The Mann-Kendall test was used to determine the statistical significance of the temporal trends, and their magnitude was estimated using the Theil-Sen approach. The results indicate an asymmetry in temporal trends of landfast ice thickness; statistically significant thickening of the ice cover over time was detected on the western side of Hudson Bay, while a slight thinning lacking statistical significance was observed on the eastern side. This asymmetry is related to the variability of air temperature, snow depth, and the dates of ice freeze-up and break-up. Increasing maximum ice thickness at a number of stations is correlated to earlier freeze-up due to negative temperature trends in autumn. Nevertheless, changes in maximum ice thickness were reciprocal to the variability in the amount of snow covering the ground. These results are in contrast to the projections from general circulation models (GCMs), and to the reduction in sea-ice extent and thickness observed in other regions of the Arctic. This contradiction must be addressed in regional climate change impact assessments.

J	Daniszewski, P				Daniszewski, Piotr			Evaluation of Chemical and Physico-Chemical Indicators of Water in the Lakes of Barlinek-Gorzow Landscape Park (North-West Poland)	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												This paper presents the evaluation of physico-chemical parameters of lake water in the Barlinek-Gorzow Landscape Park based on the European Union Water Framework Directive. The research was carried out in the years 2008-2012, between April and October. From each of the three measuring stations located in the lakes included the study, two separate water samples were taken for chemical analysis. Upon sampling, the water pH was measured. Water was tested in compliance with the Polish Standards. Collected water samples were stabilized pursuant to the guidelines of the Polish Standards. Other indicators of water quality were marked within 24 h of sampling. The oxidation of dissolved organic matter was measured with the COD-Mn method, in accordance with Polish Standards. The pH values in the neutral range-7.48 to 7.85 in all lakes water. According to the classification of the European Union Water Framework Directive, all lakes were classified as first class. The tests have demonstrated that water quality in the lakes with regard to the tested indicators varied. By analyzing the average annual values, one can note that the pH, O-2diss. and NO3 - concentration showed a relatively small variation in all the investigated lakes. The total suspended solids (TSS) in the lakes Barlineckie, Glebokie, Suche, Lubiszewko, Przyleg and Chlop, fell into the II class, while the lakes Lubie and Wielgie met the criteria of the III class. The P-total concentrations in the surface layer of the lakes was little differentiated, reaching the levels appropriate for the II and III quality class according to the classification of the European Union Water Framework Directive. The total phosphorus concentration was 0.21-0.67 mg dm(-3). The highest concentration of total phosphorus was recorded in Lakes Przyleg and Wielgie. The total suspended solids in the lakes Barlineckie, Glebokie, Suche, Lubiszewko, Przyleg and Chlop, fell into the II class, while the lakes Lubie and Wielgie met the criteria of the III class. The P-total concentrations in the surface layer of the lakes was little differentiated, reaching the levels appropriate for the II and III quality class according to the classification of the European Union Water Framework Directive.																			0970-7077	0975-427X				MAY	2014	26	9	A				2527	2536		10.14233/ajchem.2014.15702	http://dx.doi.org/10.14233/ajchem.2014.15702													WOS:000335841000006

Biological Invasions: European Smelt Osmerus eperlanus (L.) and Microsporidium Glugea hertwigi Weissenberg, 1911	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The paper presents the phenomenology of European smelt Osmerus eperlanus and microsporidium Glugea hertwigi invasion into a new habitat, Lake Syamozero (Karelia), where neither of the species occurred before. The invasion history falls into four phases. The first, latent, phase started with a spontaneous invasion of the lake by smelt and lasted until the first fish showed up in catches (1968-1970). The second phase (from 1971 to 1980) was characterized by the population explosion of the invader. The smelt became the dominant species in the fish community, while the native plankton feeder, the vendace Coregonus albula, became an endangered species. The third phase (from 1980 to 1991) was marked by the population explosion of the microsporidium Glugea hertwigi and subsequent epizootic development. The fourth phase (from 1991 to present) is distinguished by the decreasing population of the invasive species, the smelt and the microsporidium Glugea hertwigi, and the recovery of the native vendace population.

However, the historical hydrology and ecological evolution in a concentrated distribution of permafrost in this region remain unclear, hindering our understanding of past and future changes in this region in the context of global warming. Here, we obtained a complete permafrost core from the Mohe Basin in the Greater Khingan Mountains in Northeast China. We reconstructed the hydrology and ecological evolution of the permafrost region since the Late Pleistocene (30 cal. ka BP) using organic geochemical evidence (including TOC, TN, C/N ratio, stable isotopes delta 13Corg and delta 15N) from a permafrost core, as well as AMS14C dating. The results indicate that the environment in the permafrost region in the Mohe Basin closely aligned with the glacial, deglaciation, and interglacial. Between the Last Mega-Interstadial and the Last Glacial Maximum (30-19 cal. ka BP), the surface runoff gradually decreased, primary productivity was low, the wetlands shrank until they disappeared, and a grassland ecosystem formed. During the Last Deglaciation (19-11.5 cal. ka BP), although the organic matter content fluctuated, the surface runoff and primary productivity increased, and the catchment area of the watershed expanded, leading to redevelopment of the wetlands, and a coniferous-dominated mixed forest wetland ecosystem formed. In the Early to Middle Holocene (11.5-5.8 cal. ka BP), primary productivity and surface runoff increased further, gradual wetland expansion reached the maximum extent, and a mixed coniferous-broadleaved forest wetland ecosystem formed. During the Middle to Late Holocene (since 5.8 cal. ka BP), primary productivity and surface runoff decreased, and the wetland water level declined, initiating peatland development and ultimately a coniferous forest swamp ecosystem formed. We believe that the ice volume in the Northern Hemisphere and the East Asian summer monsoon alternately controlled the regional hydrology and ecological evolution during different periods.

The impact of future climate change on bean cultivation in the Prespa Lake catchment, northern Greece	EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION												Local impact projections for the Prespa Lake catchment (northern Greece) were generated using the regional climate model RCA4 of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, as driven by the global climate model MPI-ESM-LR of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology under two RCP future emissions scenarios: RCP 4.5 (some mitigating measures applied) and RCP 8.5 (business as usual). These projections indicate that temperatures in this region will rise statistically significantly-by 1-3 degrees C (RCP 4.5) and 3-6 degrees C (RCP 8.5)-by the end of the century. Future wet season precipitation is not projected to change, but precipitation variability and maximum dry spell (P < 1 mm) length will increase statistically significantly. Bean cultivation using current species and methods will be adversely affected by future climate change. Temperature-based indices that are relevant to the seed and growth stages point to deteriorating conditions in the future under both climate change scenarios tested. Harmful days with mean temperatures of > 16 degrees C during the seed stage (15/04-15/05) will increase, while days with maximum temperatures that fall within the optimum range (21 degrees C < T-max < 26 degrees C) during the growth and blossoming stages (15/05-30/08) will decrease. Current irrigation methods using lake water will become more difficult to sustain in the future, as very low lake levels will become more frequent. Based on these simulations, we recommend that heat- and drought-resistant varieties of bean crops that do not require (much) irrigation should be prioritized and promoted for climate-proof agriculture. Sustainable irrigation methods, such as drip irrigation and the use of recycled wastewater, should be selected in the future. These recommendations will be integrated into local farming practice and policy recommendations for regional agricultural adaptation measures.					van der Schriek, Tim/D-1495-2009; Giannakopoulos, Christos/H-6827-2014; Varotsos, Konstantinos V./ABE-9802-2021	van der Schriek, Tim/0000-0003-4379-3349; Varotsos, Konstantinos V./0000-0002-9483-908X													2365-6433	2365-7448				APR 3	2020	5	1							14	10.1007/s41207-020-0151-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41207-020-0151-8													WOS:000523751600002

Based on the data of precipitation, terrain, stream systems, land use and the map of vegetation distribution in Qaidam Basin, we studied the factors influencing the spatial distribution of vegetation. The results showed that the vegetation was generally low in Qaidam Basin and there was a clear semi-ring structure from southeast to northwest. In some areas, the existence of rivers, lakes and spring belts turned this semi-ring structure into a non-continuous state and formed distinct bright spots and continuous linear features. There were four main factors that affected the spatial distribution of vegetation coverage in Qaidam Basin, i.e., precipitation, hydrological conditions, altitude and human activities. Precipitation and altitude have a correlation and determine the basic pattern of vegetation distribution in Qaidam Basin. The impacts of hydrological conditions and human activities were mainly embodied in partial areas, and often broke the pattern of vegetation distribution dominated by precipitation and altitude.

Chlorophyll content and factors affecting its spatial distribution in the Middle Volga reservoirs	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												On the basis of the data obtained during field observations in the summer low water period of 2001, the patterns of chlorophyll distribution and its relation to hydrological and hydrochemical factors in two eutrophic reservoirs of the Middle Volga are studied. The hydrological structure of the Gorky Reservoir, where the Volga water mass dominates, is homogeneous, while in the Cheboksary Reservoir along with the eutrophic Volga waters, the mesotrophic Oka water masses can be distinguished keeping their abiotic and biotic features over a long distance. Phytoplankton in the two contiguous reservoirs with different flow regimens and anthropogenic loads responds differently to the external influence. An autotrophic community in the Gorky Reservoir is more stable and depends little on abiotic factors which account for similar to 63% of the explained chlorophyll variation. In the Cheboksary Reservoir under maximal for the Volga cascade flow velocity and anthropogenic load, the development and distribution of phytoplankton are almost completely (R-2=0.93) controlled by these factors. The trophic state of the reservoirs has not changed as compared to the beginning of the 1990s.

Dongting Lake, as a typical river-lake interconnected system, is freely connected with the Yangtze River and their HC plays a major role in keeping the system healthy. Climate, hydrology, and anthropogenic activities are associated with the HC. In this study, hydrological drivers were divided into the total flow of three inlets (T-flow) and the total flow of four tributaries (F-flow). To elucidate the HC of the Dongting Lake, HC was calculated by geostatistical methods in association with Sentinel-2 remote sensing images. Then, the structural equation model (SEM) was used to quantify the impacts of hydrology (F-flow, and T-flow) and meteorology (precipitation, evaporation, and temperature) on HC. The geostatistical analysis results demonstrated that the HC showed apparent seasonal change. For East and West Dongting Lake, the dominant element was north-south hydrological connectivity (N-S HC), and the restricted was west-east hydrological connectivity (W-E HC), but the dominant element was E-W HC and the restricted was N-S HC in South Dongting Lake. The results of SEM showed that N-S HC was mainly explained by T-flow (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) and F-flow (r = 0.28, p < 0.05). T-flow, temperature (r = 0.33, p < 0.05), and F-flow explained E-W HC. The finding of this work supports the management of both the Dongting Lake floodplain and other similar river-lake floodplain systems.

In order to investigate the response of catchment soil erosion and organic carbon burial to climate change and human activity, a sediment core spanning the last 160 years was retrieved from Lake Chenghai in southwest China. Multi-proxy analysis including grain-size composition and geochemical indicators were undertaken in this study. The result of grain-size vs. standard deviation method shows that the sensitive component with a modal size of 13.2 mu m is related to fluvial processes and sensitive to the catchment soil erosion. The increasing intensity of soil erosion was mainly determined by the weakening of Indian summer monsoon and global warming. as well as intensive human activities during the middle of 20th century, which resulted in decreasing vegetation cover in Lake Chenghai catchment. The organic carbon burial rate was also attributed to the catchment disturbance. indicating that increased catchment soil erosion may impact the terrestrial carbon recycling.					; sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022; qf, Jiang/AGY-9132-2022; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016	Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; Jiang, Qingfeng/0000-0003-2489-6801; Jiang, Qingfeng/0000-0003-3518-4279													1129-5767	1723-8633					2018	77	3					372	384		10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1762	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1762													WOS:000456092500003

Spatiotemporal Variability of Cyanobacteria Blooms from Their MODIS-Based Automatic Identification	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												An automatic algorithm is proposed for identifying areas of cyanobacteria (CB) blooms in the Azov Sea based on an analysis of the optical spectra of MODIS satellite data. The algorithm has been validated by comparison with high-resolution quasi-synchronous Landsat data. The results obtained with this algorithm were used to study the spatiotemporal variability of CB blooms in the Azov Sea in 2003-2019 and give examples of the evolution of blooms in individual years. CB blooms in the Azov Sea are observed from March to November with a peak in August. The most intense and longest CB blooms are observed in Taganrog Bay. In the spring months, they spread from here eastward along the northern coast. In June-July, CB begin to intensively spread southward along the eastern coast and then, in some years, they penetrate into the center of the basin under the action of anticyclonic currents. An analysis of interannual variability has shown that the intensity of blooms was the highest in 2004-2011, with a peak in 2008-2009, and dropped significantly in 2011-2019. One reason for this drop is the decreased flow of the Don and Kuban rivers, as well as the increased wind speed observed in recent years.

This reconstruction is supported by 25 new radiocarbon dates on palaeosols that provide additional constraints on the Holocene tephro-chronostratigraphy. We show evidence of two catastrophic Ngozi eruptions and five Rungwe pumice fallout deposits, and also identify several more intercalated poorly preserved pumice and ash deposits. The Ngozi eruptions probably played a role in shaping the present-day caldera. The Rungwe record includes a ca. 2.2 km(3) deposit of a Plinian-style eruption dated at ca. 4 ka, a sub-Plinian one at ca. 2 ka and at least three additional smaller-scale fallout deposits. The Rungwe explosive eruptive record shows that the volcano has been frequently active in its late Holocene past.

Every month we randomly isolated juveniles of 20 clones from the lake and measured their life-history parameters immediately after isolation, i.e., under the influence of all modifying factors in the lake. The measurements were repeated after the clones had been kept in the laboratory for at least six generations without predator signals (controls) and with the addition of fish and Chaoborus kairomones. SFR increased monotonously from July to December in Fresh field isolates. Laboratory controls showed always much larger SFR; but approached field value in December. Most of the size difference was due to maternal effects. Reproductive allocation showed a different pattern than SFR with a minimum in September both in field samples and laboratory controls. Fish kairomone reduced SFR in July and August when fish predation is high, but not later in the fear. On the contrary, Chaoborus kairomone increased SFR in September and October when Chaoborus larvae are abundant in the lake, but not in summer. This indicates a seasonal shift in the clonal composition of D, hyalina populations towards clones adapted to the specific predation pressure. Reproductive allocation changed in response to fish kairomone in July and August, but not in response to Chaoborus kairomone. In this mesotrophic lake, fish have a stronger direct and indirect impact on Daphnia life history than Chaoborus larvae.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				JAN	2000	88	1					129	138		10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880115.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.880115.x													WOS:000085424600015

H2S concentrations higher than 1 mg l-1 and Fe2+ concentration above 0.20 mgl-1 produce interferences in the SRP analysis in many occasions (e.g., 80% underestimation of SRP). Intefering concentrations of these materials are present in anoxic water from a large number of lakes, groundwater springs and ocean basins. The mechanisms of the interferences are discussed and methods described to prevent these analytical errors. Fe2+ is not problematic if the sample is kept anoxic before and during filtration; vigorous aeration is obligatory if H2S is present. Simple methods to test for both the possible interfering compounds are presented. For the water from the anoic hypolimniaof 8 lakes, a modified analysis of total (unfiltered) reactive P (TRP) yields on average only 2% lower P concentrations than SRP analysis. TRP hence can replace the complicated SRP analysis in anoxic waters.					; Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022	Nurnberg, Gertrud/0000-0003-1752-6562; 													0043-1354	1879-2448					1984	18	3					369	377		10.1016/0043-1354(84)90114-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(84)90114-3													WOS:A1984SC24500016

Val; Guo, Laodong			Variations in chemical speciation and reactivity of phosphorus between suspended-particles and surface-sediment in seasonal hypoxia-influenced Green Bay	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water, suspended-particles, and surface-sediment samples were collected from Green Bay, Lake Michigan, for the measurements of phosphorus (P) species, including dissolved/particulate-P, inorganic/organic-P, and five different forms of particulate-P, namely exchangeable- or labile-P (Ex-P), iron-bound-P (Fe-P), biogenic-apatite and/or CaCO3-associated-P (CFA-P), organic-P (Org-P) and detrital-apatite-P (Detr-P) to elucidate their reactivity and transformation pathways in the water column. Suspended particles contained mainly Ex-P (25 +/- 15%), Fe-P (28 +/- 12%) and Org-P (29 +/- 7%). In contrast, Detr-P (34 +/- 10%) and Org-P (36 +/- 12%) were the predominant P species in surface sediment. Contents of Ex-P, Fe-P, Org-P and CFA-P decreased consistently from suspended particles to surface-sediment, but an increase was observed for the Detr-P, indicating a net loss of Ex-P, Fe-P, Org-P and CFA-P from particulate into dissolved phase. Such active regeneration of P in the water column between particulate and dissolved phases may serve as an internal phosphate source in Green Bay, especially under hypoxic conditions. Degradation of organic matter in south central bay areas seemed to promote hypoxia and enhance the reductive-dissolution of Fe-P and preservation of Org-P under low-oxygen conditions in the central bay. Overall, Ex-P, Fe-P, CFA-P and Org-P species, which comprised up to 50-90% of total particulate-P, can be collectively considered as potentially-bioavailable-P (BAP). Under low-phosphate (0.022 +/- 0.014 mu M in Green Bay) and summer low-oxygen/hypoxic conditions, suspended-particles may release up to 71% of their BAP before deposited in sediment although the BAP regeneration decreased along the south-north transect in Green Bay.

Widespread application of these models is encouraged, however for this to be realised necessary parameter values, such as pollen productivity estimates require further investigation. This study shows results of tests undertaken to detect the influence of a homogenous vegetation structure and sampling strategy upon the calculation of PPEs from contemporary data. Using a collection of contemporary moss samples, sub-groups were created using defined sampling strategies (random or systematic) and nearest neighbour distance thresholds to investigate the influence of these conditions upon PPE generation. Results suggest that a random sampling strategy achieves the most reliable values, but using a systematic strategy is possible. Furthermore, in areas where vegetation patterning is non-stationary, a large degree of variation is incorporated into the values obtained, and the use of quantitative models in such situations could be problematic.

It is crucial to ascertain the pollution status, influencing factors, ecological risks, and possible sources of heavy metals in the sediments of the Xiangjiang River. Sediment is both a source and a sink of heavy metals in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, surface sediment was collected from the Zhuzhou Reach of the Xiangjiang River and eight heavy metals were investigated. Results In all sediment samples, all eight heavy metals were detected and their average concentration fell in the order of Zn > Pb > As > Cu > Cr > Ni > Cd > Co. Assessment shows extremely serious Cd pollution and a very high potential ecological risk from Cd. According to correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), As, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn originate from industrial wastewater and mineral smelting activities, whereas Co, Cr, and Ni come from natural sources. Redundancy analysis (RDA) reveals that the organic matter content and the particle size of the sediment have a certain influence on the enrichment of heavy metals. Conclusion Among all eight examined heavy metals in the surveyed area, the content of Zn, Pb, and As is the highest, and that of Cd and Co is the lowest. Despite a low level of absolute content, the Cd in sediment already renders a high ecological risk and thus calls for urgent attention. Anthropogenic activities are the main source of heavy metals in the sediment. The distribution of heavy metals may also be influenced by sediment properties. The results provide guidance for controlling heavy metal pollution and protecting drinking water sources in the Xiangjiang River.

J	Briggs, SV				Briggs, SV			Native small mammals and reptiles in cropped and uncropped parts of lakebeds in semi-arid Australia	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Small mammals and reptiles were surveyed by trapping in uncropped and cropped parts of two dry lakebeds in semi-arid New South Wales, Australia, in spring 1992 and 1993. Four species of native small mammals (18 individuals) were captured in uncropped parts of the lakebeds, compared with two individuals of one species in cropped parts of the lakebeds. A total of 38 reptiles (seven species) was caught at, the uncropped sites compared with 10 individuals (four species) at the cropped sites. Small mammals were absent where the soil was scarified and bare between crop cycles. The habitat requirements of small mammals (particularly Planigale gilesi) and reptiles need to be provided for when cropping lakebeds. The most effective way to do this is to leave wide strips of uncropped soil at the edges of lakebeds, and patches of uncropped country that are connected to the strips, on lakebeds.																			1035-3712						1996	23	5					629	636																WOS:A1996VE77500010

The study was carried out during summer stratification using a two-dimensional array of sediment traps deployed in the hypolimnion. Samples of the sedimentary material were analysed for total C and total N, P, Ca, Si, Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Na, K, and the trace elements Zr, Sr, Rb, Ti, Ba, S, Pb and Zn. The elements can be classified according to their preferences in associating with a specific carrier phase. The fluxes and composition of trapped particles were found to vary seasonally with fluctuations in the main components (organic matter, calcium carbonate, biogenic silica, manganese and iron oxides, silicates) and spatially due to the following in-lake processes: 1) increasing vertical particle transport of biomass and mineralic material in the shoreward direction, 2) lateral sediment transport, which caused sediment accumulation rates to increase with depth, leading to sediment focusing, 3) episodic and patchy events of CaCO3 precipitation in the epilimnion followed by sedimentation and lateral dispersion, and 4) formation of a patchy nepheloid layer in the slightly denser bottom waters containing more fine-grained particles in suspension. Sediment focusing by lateral pathways caused by particle transport between the southern and the northern basin of Lower Lake Zurich gave rise to post-depositional in-lake redistribution of particle-bound contaminants.

Baekdusan using Surface Displacement	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY												There have been a number of observed precursors of volcanic activities-such as volcanic earthquake, surface inflation, specific volcanic gas emission, temperature of hot spring-at Mt. Baekdusan since 2002. We identified the increase of the volume of magma chamber beneath Mt. Baekdusan as we observed an inflation trend of vertical and horizontal surface displacement around Cheonji caldera lake by using precise leveling data from 2002 to 2009. The surface displacement trend changed to deflation in 2010, and the trend changed to inflation again after a while. Utilizing the data of inflated surface (46.33 mm) on the northern slope of Mt. Baekdusan from 2002 to 2003, we calculated the volume change of magma chamber beneath the Mt. Baekdusan. The volume change was about 0.008 km(3) (7.7-8.0x 10(6) m(3)) from 2002 to 2003. It indicated that a new magma (0.008 km(3)) injected to the magma chamber 5 km below Mt. Baekdusan.

We employed diverse biogeochemical techniques on a high-resolution sediment record from a subarctic lake in northern Finland (70 degrees N) to examine the direction, magnitude and mechanism of change in aquatic carbon pools prior to and under the anthropogenic warming. Coupled variation in the elemental and isotopic composition of the sediment and a proxy-based summer air temperature reconstruction tracked changes in aquatic production, depicting a decline during a cool climate interval between similar to 1700-1900 C.E. and a subsequent increase over the 20th century. OC accumulation rates displayed similar coeval variation with temperature, mirroring both changes in aquatic production and terrestrial carbon export. Increase in sediment organic content over the 20th century together with high inferred aquatic UV exposure imply that the 20th century increase in OC accumulation is primarily connected to elevated lake production rather than terrestrial inputs. The changes in the supply of autochthonous energy sources were further reflected higher up the benthic food web, as evidenced by biotic stable isotopic fingerprints.					; Rantala, Marttiina/GWV-8049-2022	Nevalainen, Liisa/0000-0001-6837-8753; Rantala, Marttiina/0000-0002-3231-5926; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; 													2045-2322					OCT 6	2016	6								34780	10.1038/srep34780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep34780								27708382					WOS:000385179700001
J	Szostak, JW				Szostak, Jack W.			ON THE ORIGIN OF LIFE	MEDICINA-BUENOS AIRES												The origin of life is a very rich field, filled with possibilities and ripe for discovery. RNA replication requires chemical energy and vesicle division is easy to do with mechanical energy. These requirements point to a surface lake, perhaps at some time following the period of concentrated cyanide chemistry that gave rise to nucleotides, amino acids and (maybe) fatty acids. A second requirement follows specifically from the nature of the RNA replication cycle, which requires generally cool to moderate temperatures for the copying chemistry, punctuated by brief periods of high temperature for strand separation. Remarkably, lakes in a geothermal active area provide just such a fluctuating temperature environment, because lakes similar to Yellowstone can be generally cool (even ice covered in winter), but they contain numerous hydrothermal vents that emit streams of hot water. Protocells in such an environment would occasionally be swept into these hot water streams, where the transient high temperature exposure would cause RNA strand separation. However, the protocells would be quickly mixed with surrounding cold water, and would therefore cool quickly, before their delicate RNA molecules could be destroyed by heat. Because of the combination of favorable chemical and physical environments, this could be the most likely scenario for the early Earth environment that nurtured the origin of life.																			0025-7680	1669-9106					2016	76	4					199	203											27576276					WOS:000382903800001

The wide variety of life modes and habitat requirements of non-marine ostracod species yields assemblages of species of value as ecological indicators. Endorheic shallow lakes, highly temporary, are characterized by an assemblage of circum-Mediterranean and endemic species. Karstic and more stable lakes are inhabited by northern Holarctic or Palaearctic species, depending on the history and environmental conditions of the water body. Between these two extremes, the study of ostracod assemblages permits the distinction, on a finer scale, of a gradient of lake types with different disturbance conditions, resulting from a combination of hydrological, climatic, chemical and anthropogenic factors. At the extreme of that gradient, highly tolerant cosmopolitan species play an important role in the ostracod community of sites severely affected by human activities.

The layer consists of alkali feldspar, quartz, plagioclase, amphibole, pyrex ene, opaques, titanite and glass shards. Electron microprobe analyses and morphological study of glass shards allowed correlation with the upper part of the Laacher See Tephra of the Laacher See volcano (Eifel Mountains, Germany). Sedimentological features of enclosing lacustrine sediments suggest that a momentary decrease in precipitation occurred in the catchment area and consequent reduction in detrital supply in the lake, after the ash fall-out. This has been interpreted as the environmental response to a momentary cooling following the Laacher See Tephra aerosols emission. Comparison with sedimentological features characterizing the Allerod-Younger Dryas transition highlights the sensitivity of Lake Geneva system in recording both short and long-terms climate-induced environmental changes.

However, there are relatively few studies in academia that analyse and evaluate the water quality of multiple reservoirs at the same time. To address this knowledge deficit, we collected 108 water samples from three different reservoirs in Chuzhou City for 36 months (from 2019 to 2021), explored the drivers of changes in water quality parameters over time and the extent of eutrophication. Our results indicated that the water quality of the reservoirs was deteriorating during the study period, among which Huanglishu Reservoir and Shahe Reservoir reached mild eutrophic status, and both had higher eutrophication levels than Chengxi Reservoir. Secchi depth, total nitrogen and total phosphorus were the principal factors inducing eutrophication. The biassed utilization of reservoir functions was the major contributor to the discrepancy in the degree of eutrophication. Furthermore, Pearson correlation analysis revealed that there are significant correlations between many water quality parameters. Cluster analysis grouped the 12 months of each year into three clusters (stable water level period, rainy season high flow period and winter low flow period). Based on this, analysis of variance showed that most water quality parameters varied considerably between the clusters. Collectively, this study identified the actual water quality conditions of three reservoirs in Chuzhou City and provided guidance for local water quality management and environmental protection.																			1936-0584	1936-0592				APR	2024	17	3								10.1002/eco.2629	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2629		JAN 2024											WOS:001147759900001

Pairwise comparisons and genetic clustering analysis were used to characterize the two green sturgeon Distinct Population Segments (DPSs) from 20 collections using eight tetrasomic and two disomic microsatellite loci. The observed pattern of green sturgeon DPS composition among five estuaries in California, Oregon, and Washington was supported with assignment testing approaches utilizing the same genotypic data in codominant polysomic and pseudo-dominant allele phenotype formats. The majority of individuals in northern DPS estuaries originated from the threatened Southern DPS, except in Winchester Bay and Grays Harbor. We detected few Northern DPS green sturgeon in San Pablo Bay, the principal Southern DPS estuary, supporting that green sturgeon preferentially disperse north once they enter their coastal migration. Our genetic findings suggest that stock complexity in green sturgeon is pervasive and support precautionary, interjurisdictional approaches for managing green sturgeon beyond rigid, regulatory boundaries.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	2009	66	9					1491	1504		10.1139/F09-091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F09-091													WOS:000269834500009
J	Hudak, MR; Bindeman, IN				Hudak, Michael R.; Bindeman, Ilya N.			Conditions of pinnacle formation and glass hydration in cooling ignimbrite sheets from H and O isotope systematics at Crater Lake and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Spire-like pinnacles and fins are common features in silicic ignimbrite sheets that represent the fluxing of water through the cooling deposit. Fumarolic pinnacles at Crater Lake, Oregon (Mt. Mazama; 7.7 ka) and in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, Alaska (VTTS; 1912) represent the iconic images of these processes. Glasses within these structures remain fresh despite experiencing high temperatures and extensive water-rock interaction with infiltrating groundwater. These glasses can be used to interrogate the thermal and hydrologic conditions of pinnacle formation, which are not well-understood. Higher diffusivity of water at elevated temperatures facilitates rapid secondary hydration of glass. This allows for delta D of pinnacle glasses to be used a "snapshot" proxy for the isotopic composition of the hydrating meteoric water with applications to paleoaltitude and paleoclimate. We present comprehensive H and 0 isotope data for volcanic glasses from pinnacles in the VTTS and from Crater Lake, which includes bulk delta O-18 giass and delta O-I7(glass) analyses and a new parameter, delta O-18 of water-in-glass(delta O-18(wig)) The delta D and delta O-18 values of lake waters from the Katmai region are used to constrain the likely composition of VTTS hydration waters. The VTTS rhyolitic glasses from fumarolic mounds in the uppermost portion of the ignimbrite have depleted delta D-glass (>=-152%o) but minimally depleted delta O-18(glass) in high H2O (4.2 wt.%) pumices. These trends are best explained by the simple addition of modern meteoric waters from the Katmai region, thereby providing a snapshot of the meteoric water composition in the years to decades following the 1912 AD Novarupta-Katmai eruption. Glasses from Crater Lake pinnacles are used to estimate the delta D and delta O-18 of their hydration water shortly following the eruption of Mt. Mazama as well as the temperature conditions of their formation. Mt. Mazama glasses contain a narrow range of 1.6-1.9 wt.% H2O with depleted delta D and delta O-18(glass) values as low as 149%o and 0.95%o, respectively. All measured delta Dg(lass) and delta O-18(glass) values fall between 75-100 degrees C based on estimated SD and delta O-18 equilibrium fractionation between glass and water, as do Delta'O-17(glass) compositions. The new delta O-18(glass)-delta O-18(wig) approach gives a wider range of temperatures up to similar to 150 degrees C, but overall are in good agreement with S1800ass isotope data. These compositions indicate 75-150 degrees C hydration temperatures and record extensive isotope exchange with meteoric waters. The near-boiling hydration temperatures strongly suggest that cooling ignimbrites remain dry above these temperatures. Cooling ignimbrite sheets likely have enough magmatic vapor overpressure to drive off vapor from ambient hydrosphere surface waters until they approach similar to 100 degrees C, at which point external waters are able to percolate into the deposit. Pinnacles therefore reflect late-stage cooling features rather than vigorous fumaroles. These results are consistent with previous modeling work on cooling ignimbrites that drive water away until sub-boiling temperatures, but contrast with the near-magmatic temperatures previously suggested by depletions in delta O-18 in ignimbrite groundmass. Reconstructed delta D and delta O-18 values of paleo-meteoric waters at Mt. Mazama are -130 and -120%o and -17.5 and -16.3%o respectively, notably lighter than modern spring water compositions. This is interpreted to reflect a low-delta D and low-delta O-18 groundwater source fed by high altitude glaciers or snowfields that originated from >3 km on the pre-collapse of Mt. Mazama edifice, more than 1 km above the modern lake level. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Salonen, VP; Varjo, E; Rantala, P				Salonen, VP; Varjo, E; Rantala, P			Gypsum treatment in managing the internal phosphorus load from sapropelic sediments; experiments on Lake Laikkalammi, Finland	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The sediment of the hypertrophic Lake Laikkalammi, (area 8000 m(2), max. depth 13 m) in southern Finland was treated with the industrial by-product Fe-gypsum (CaSO4 x 2H(2)O) in summer 1998. A 90% reduction of the hypolimnic total phosphorus content was achieved and Secchi disk transparency increased from 50 cm to 270 em during one year long observation period. Gypsum is hypothesized to limit the internal load through three interacting mechanisms: as a mechanical cover limiting the resuspension and gas ebullition, as a chemical offering binding sites for phosphorus (Ca, Fe) and finally by changing the microbiological composition of sediment by creating more favorable conditions for sulphur bacteria instead of methane bacteria. Fe-gypsum treatment can be seen as a complementary lake restoration method that is suitable for relatively deep, small lakes in which the water quality problems are a consequence of internal loading caused by oxygen deficiency in the hypolimnion.																			1239-6095						2001	6	2					119	129																WOS:000174779600004

Methods of directly sampling methane from environments such as wetlands may fail to capture the temporal and spatial variations in emissions at a specific site and time. The Keeling plot method is commonly used to infer the overarching isotopic signatures of methane sources. In this study, we have expanded the application of the Keeling plot from conventional stable isotope ratios to include novel clumped isotopologue compositions of methane. This advancement aims to provide more robust constraints on regional methane emission signatures. We analyzed methane isotopologue compositions from air samples collected above wetlands and landfills across Maryland, USA, and determined the end-member compositions for background air, wetland, and landfill sources. Our findings indicate that the isotopologue compositions of methane from regional wetland emissions exhibit seasonal variations-delta 13C and delta D values become less positive as winter approaches, reflecting changes in methane oxidation and production rates. The continuous monitoring of air methane isotopologue signatures will deepen our understanding of the seasonal patterns in methane emissions and contribute to refining the global methane budget, as valuable insights can be extracted from these measurements.					; Sun, Jiayang/LOS-6367-2024	Sun, Jiayang/0000-0001-9736-8511; Magen, Cedric/0000-0003-0758-2675; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				APR	2025	130	4							e2024JG008249	10.1029/2024JG008249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008249													WOS:001466939300001

Near-Surface Refractory Black Carbon Observations in the Atmosphere and Snow in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, and Potential Impacts of Foehn Winds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Measurements of light-absorbing particles in the boundary layer of the high southern latitudes are scarce, particularly in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica. During the 2013-2014 austral summer near-surface boundary layer refractory black carbon (rBC) aerosols were measured in air by a single-particle soot photometer (SP2) at multiple locations in the MDV. Near-continuous rBC atmospheric measurements were collected at Lake Hoare Camp (LH) over 2months and for several hours at more remote locations away from established field camps. We investigated periods dominated by both upvalley and downvalley winds to explore the causes of differences in rBC concentrations and size distributions. Snow samples were also collected in a 1m pit on a glacier near the camp. The range of concentrations rBC in snow was 0.3-1.20.3g-rBC/L-H2O, and total organic carbon was 0.3-1.40.3mg/L. The rBC concentrations measured in this snow pit are not sufficient to reduce surface albedo; however, there is potential for accumulation of rBC on snow and ice surfaces at low elevation throughout the MDV, which were not measured as part of this study. At LH, the average background rBC mass aerosol concentrations were 1.3ng/m(3). rBC aerosol mass concentrations were slightly lower, 0.09-1.3ng/m(3), at the most remote sites in the MDV. Concentration spikes as high as 200ng/m(3) were observed at LH, associated with local activities. During a foehn wind event, the average rBC mass concentration increased to 30-50ng/m(3). Here we show that the rBC increase could be due to resuspension of locally produced BC from generators, rocket toilets, and helicopters, which may remain on the soil surface until redistributed during high wind events. Quantification of local production and long-range atmospheric transport of rBC to the MDV is necessary for understanding the impacts of this species on regional climate. Plain Language Summary Measurements of light-absorbing particles in the boundary layer of the high southern latitudes are scarce, particularly in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica. During the 2013-2014 austral summer near-surface black carbon (BC) aerosols were measured in air by a single-particle soot photometer at multiple locations in the MDV, as well as in a 1msnow pit. The BC concentrations in snow are too low to influence the surface albedo. Average atmospheric BC concentrations were also low, except during local activities and during a foehn wind event when the average BC concentration increased by more than a factor of 30. Here we show that the BC increase could be due to resuspension of locally produced particles, which may remain on the soil surface until redistributed during high wind events. Quantification of local production and long-range atmospheric transport of BC to the MDV is necessary for understanding the impacts of this species on regional climate.					; schwarz, joshua/G-4556-2013; Xian, Peng/Q-4159-2019; McMeeking, Gavin/A-7679-2008	Xian, Peng/0000-0001-7602-0524; schwarz, joshua/0000-0002-9123-2223; Welch, Kathleen/0000-0003-1028-3086; Khan, Alia/0000-0002-4425-1528; McMeeking, Gavin/0000-0001-9782-3713; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533													2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 16	2018	123	5					2877	2887		10.1002/2017JD027696	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JD027696													WOS:000428437100029

An in-depth morphological description of the collected free-swimming and attached isopods identified Livoneca redmanii Leach, 1818. Identification was confirmed by the close evolutionary relationship of L. redmanii isolates among the three sectors, as evidenced by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of COI and 16S rRNA genes. Sequence data from both genes were deposited in GenBank, each with a unique assigned accession number. The utility of COI as a robust barcode for Cymothoidae, in contrast to the more conserved 16S rRNA, was further supported, aligning with best practices for species-level resolution. Isopod-infested fish exhibited respiratory distress, skin erosion, hemorrhagic patches, branchial damage, morbidity, and mortality. The highest prevalence rate of isopod was recorded in the west sector (82.5%), with the summer showing the highest prevalence across all three sectors. The west sector also exhibited the highest mean infestation intensity of 3.6 isopods per fish, compared to 1.8 and 2.6 isopods per fish in the middle and east sectors, respectively. A higher fish condition factor of 1.01 was reported in the middle sector, while lower values of 0.85 and 0.61 were observed in the east and west sectors, respectively. Physicochemical water analysis revealed elevated pH, total ammonia, salinity, turbidity, and lower dissolved oxygen, particularly in the west sector during the summer. The current study provided a detailed morpho-molecular description of L. redmanii in the Egyptian sole, along with spatial and temporal prevalence correlated to ecological factors. These findings emphasize the importance of implementing efficient control protocols that target these destructive invasive isopods.					bessat, mohamed/W-6396-2019; abdelmageed, adel/K-5569-2019; Fadel, Amr/H-2425-2018														0967-6120	1573-143X				SEP 19	2025	33	6							552	10.1007/s10499-025-02224-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-025-02224-0													WOS:001576133900004

However, it remains unclear how the carbon dynamics of these subtropical peatlands respond to climate change. Here, we reconstructed the net carbon fluxes of a typical mountainous peatland in Tianmu Mountain, eastern China, over the past thousand years. Humidity and winter temperature are two important climatic factors influencing carbon accumulation (Deviance explained 77.2%) and drought promotes Qianmutian peatland initial development. Despite the decline in carbon accumulation over the last millennium, the peatland's net carbon balance remains in a 'carbon sink' state. This suggests that the risk of carbon release from the peatland carbon pool under natural climate change conditions is not substantial in the subtropical monsoon area.

Environmental changes and the rise and fall of civilizations in the northern Horn of Africa: An approach combining δD analyses of land-plant derived fatty acids with multiple proxies in soil	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The domains of the ancient polities D'MT and Aksum in the Horn of Africa's highlands are a superior natural system for evaluating roles of environmental change on the rise and fall of civilizations. To compare environmental changes of the times of the two polities, we analyzed stable hydrogen isotopic ratios (delta D) of land-plant derived fatty acids (n-C26-30) and other proxies from soil sequences spanning the Holocene from the region. Three results suggest that trends in delta D values unambiguously reflect changes in rainfall. First, increases in delta D coincide with dry periods inferred from studies of eastern African lakes. Second, changes in delta D values were parallel among sections during overlapping time intervals. Third, consideration of vegetation history did not alter directions of trends in delta D values over time. By unambiguously recording precipitation, the delta D values also enhanced interpretations of proxies that are affected by both climate and land clearing. Both D'MT (ca 2750-2350 cal y BP) and the Aksumite (ca 2100-1250 cal y BP) rose during wetter intervals of the drier part of the Holocene (after ca 6000 cal y BP). Analyses of charred matter indicated that fire had been a common agent of land clearing in all sites. The influence of climate on fire varied, however. Prior to the emergence of D'MT, delta D values were correlated with C-4:C-3 plant ratios estimated from delta C-13 values. There are no C-4 trees and precipitation may have been the main influence on canopy openness. After ca 4300 cal y BP, there was no significant relationship between delta D and C-4:C-3 plant ratios suggesting that factors such as fire influenced canopy openness regardless of climate. Furthermore, the impact of land clearance differed between sites and between D'MT and the Aksumite's times. In one site, the interval from 3550 cal y BP to the decline of D'MT had several anomalies that suggested dramatic increases in thermal severity of fire and human impact. Among these were a large contribution of charred matter to a high% total organic carbon that low hydrogen and oxygen indices suggest was severely altered by other factors than humification. These results support hypotheses about the rise of civilizations being favored by specific climatic conditions but suggest that patterns of land clearing differed during the declines of D'MT and the Aksumite.

J	WAGNER, WH				WAGNER, WH			NORTHERN GREAT LAKES WHITE, PIERIS-VIRGINIENSIS, (LEPIDOPTERA-PIERIDAE) IN COMPARISON WITH ITS SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN COUNTERPART	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												Pieris virginiensis is widespread in northern Michigan [USA], where it flies in association with its understory larval host, toothwort (Dentaria diphylla), in large wooded sites dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and basswood (Tilia americana) in May and June. Elsewhere in eastern North America it is very rare and local, and likely to be confused with the sympatric P. napi, a swifter, bivolting species of more open habitats. The eastern Kentucky and western Virginia populations of P. virginiensis resemble the summer form of P. napi in their slightly larger size and greatly reduced markings. The two extreme forms of P. virginiensis are diagnosed, but since they are consistent with the well-known pattern of clinal variation in North American butterflies, the existence of all degrees of intermediates is predicted. A similar interpretation may apply to the subspecies of Lethe appalachia (Satyridae).																			0090-0222						1978	11	1					53	57																WOS:A1978EV04800007

Traps (13) were located on 38.4 ha Lake Warniak. Fallout was divided into 3 fractions: invertebrates, particulate matter > 50 .mu.m and < 50 .mu.m. The invertebrates, mainly insects, and the fraction < 50 .mu.m were the most important for material transport. There was no significant spatial differentiation of the amount of these fractions, or of the total fallout on the lake surface. The aerial input P varied from 0.004-0.021 g m-2 mo.-1. The inflow of P from the drainage area with surface runoff and groundwater was calculated and compared with aerial input. This input equals 53% of the inflow from the drainage area. The importance of atmospheric P loadings to lakes and their eutrophication is discussed.																			0070-9557						1981	29	1					63	71																WOS:A1981PH85800004

Monitoring 'frozen commons' with MODIS in Google Earth Engine	POLAR GEOGRAPHY												Snow, ice, and permafrost constitute 'frozen commons,' or common-pool resources that are collectively used and managed. This study examines the state and uses of snow and ice commons in two remote communities: Bayanz & uuml;rkh in Kh & ouml;vsg & ouml;l Aimag, Mongolia, and McGrath, Alaska. Regional climate analyses indicate air temperatures warmed more than 2.2 degrees C in both locales since the mid-twentieth century, compounding their similar accessibility challenges and dependence on natural resources. Warming affects transit timing and duration over snow and ice, impacting Mongolian herding and Alaskan subsistence hunting. Snow cover duration in both communities was calculated by classifying MODIS Snow Cover imagery utilizing the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API. Annual lake and river ice breakup timing and safe travel days were quantified from winter MODIS imagery from 2002 to 2023 for Lake Kh & ouml;vsg & ouml;l in Mongolia and the Kuskokwim River near McGrath, Alaska. Snow and ice duration did not significantly change over the 21 years examined. Relatively high map accuracies allowed discussion of interannual variability impacts on subsistence, transportation, and tourism. Daily snow and ice mapping in Google Earth Engine is a cost-effective and rapid method for quantifying environmental change impacting frozen commons, and therefore a tool for community decision-making and communication.

Gary			Effects of rearing temperature on volitional and escape response swimming performance in lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, from hatch to age 1	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												In fishes, differences in early rearing environment can have a significant impact on phenotypic development. In the present study, we examined the effect of differences in egg incubation (adhered to substrate or non-adhered and tumbled) and water temperature during early rearing on the development of escape response and volitional swimming performance in lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, throughout the first year of life. Developing embryos were incubated at 12-14 degrees C and supplied with flow-through aquarium water and ambient light conditions in McDonald hatching jars or allowed to adhere to substrate. Upon hatch (similar to 9 days post-fertilisation, dpf), larvae from each incubation treatment were then acclimated to 16, 18 or 20 degrees C at a rate of 0.5 degrees C center dot day(-1) and held at those temperatures until approximately 33 dpf. All treatments were then transferred to a common garden experiment where tanks were fed flow-through river water at ambient temperature and natural light cycles. Sturgeon were fed ad libitum twice daily throughout the growing season and food was withheld when water temperature reached 1.5 degrees C (similar to 6 months post-hatch). Food was reintroduced at the start of spring the following year when water temperature exceeded 2 degrees C (similar to 10.5 months post-hatch). There was no consistent effect of treatment on either volitional swimming or escape responses suggesting significant phenotypic plasticity in these measured traits during the first year of life. There was however an effect of time on these performance metrics that was most likely the result of seasonal differences in temperature throughout the 13-month study.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUL	2021	104	7					737	750		10.1007/s10641-021-01112-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01112-9		JUN 2021											WOS:000665842400001

It typically develops in mid-morning and persists until the late evening when it is replaced by a well developed land-breeze regime. Simulations of 4 cases with the Colorado State University mesoscale model show good agreement with observations and suggest that local lake breezes are strongly influenced by adjacent water bodies (e.g. Lake Erie), the elongated shape of the lake, and the large-scale wind direction. With gradient flows across the long axis of the lake, a broad band of along-lake flow develops during the afternoon (easterly winds during southerly gradient flows and westerly winds during northerly gradient flows). Furthermore, during west-to-northwesterly gradient flow a nocturnal cyclonic eddy is predicted at the western end of the lake. These results imply that wind-field models applied in the vicinity of Lake Ontario should incorporate the entire lake in their modelling domain.																			0705-5900					DEC	1993	31	4					481	499		10.1080/07055900.1993.9649482	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.1993.9649482													WOS:A1993MT39000005

Surface Impedance of a Highly Inductive Two-layer Medium	TECHNICAL PHYSICS												In winter on the Northern Sea Route and Eurasian salt lakes, radio paths can be simulated using a two-layer medium, in which the first medium (ice) is a dielectric layer and the second (sea, salt water), in the very long-, long-, medium-, and short-wavelength ranges, is the underlying conducting medium. The considered two-layer medium with real electric, physical, and geometrical parameters is characterized by a highly inductive surface impedance. A great contrast between the electric and physical properties of the ice and water layers makes it possible to separate small magnitudes in the equations for calculating the surface impedance, owing to which finite analytical expressions for reduced surface impedance (referred to below as the impedance) can be obtained with different approximations with respect to small values. It has been found that the impedance phase for the considered medium is in the range of-45.1A degrees to-89.9A degrees, which is precisely the criterion for a highly inductive surface.

Grid nodes are spaced at 100-m intervals, yielding a regular array of 121 (11 x 11) data collection points. Three sites are located in the Arctic Foothills physiographic province, and four are on the Arctic Coastal Plain. Air and soil temperature measurements are made at each site, and soil moisture is monitored at most. Six years of record permit several general conclusions: ( 1) At the landscape scale, end-of-season thaw depth is strongly correlated with local air temperature on an interannual basis. All sites experienced maximum average thaw depth in 1998 and a minimum in 2000, consistent with the warmest and coolest summers during the period of record. The active layer, however, may exhibit Markovian behavior over multidecadal periods. ( 2) There is significant intrasite variation in thaw depth and near-surface soil moisture content within each 1-km(2) grid, reflecting the local influence of vegetation, substrate properties, snow cover dynamics, and terrain. ( 3) On the Coastal Plain, thaw depth is significantly greater in drained thaw-lake basins, resulting in a bimodal distribution of thaw depth related to primary landscape elements. ( 4) Foothills sites demonstrate large spatial and interannual variability resulting from microtopography and temporal variations of soil moisture content, making predictive mapping of thaw depth problematic at the scale and resolution of the grids. The spatial pattern of thaw depth across sites on the Coastal Plain is relatively consistent, although lake margins exhibit more complex patterns attributable to fluctuating water levels.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				JAN 31	2003	108	D2							8168	10.1029/2001JD000927	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JD000927													WOS:000182897200001
J	Cole, JJ; Caraco, NF				Cole, JJ; Caraco, NF			Atmospheric exchange of carbon dioxide in a low-wind oligotrophic lake measured by the addition of SF6	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Many freshwater lakes are supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. This concentration gradient implies a net flux of CO2 from the water to the air. The actual rate of gas exchange is governed by both this concentration gradient and the gas transfer coefficient, k. To directly measure k, we added the chemically and biologically inert gas, sulfur hexaflouride (SF6), to the epilimnion of Minor Lake, New Hampshire, a small (15 ha), low-wind softwater lake. k was independent of wind speed over the 50-d summer stratification period and averaged 2.65 +/- 0.12 cm h(-1) (95% CI; normalized to a Schmidt number of 600); k(800) was better correlated to precipitation events than it was to wind speed. Our data support the idea that gas exchange across the air-water interface is largely independent of wind at low wind speeds. The surface water of Mirror Lake was persistently supersaturated in CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. During a 3.5-year period the partial pressure of CO2 in the surface waters of the lake averaged 726 +/- 39 mu atm (95% CI) and showed substantial seasonal variation (360-2,000 mu atm). Diel and day-to-day variation in CO2 were very small compared to the CO2 pool. We combined our estimates of k with weekly measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 to estimate CO2 gas exchange in the lake. Mirror Lake released from 26 to 50 g C m(-2) to the atmosphere each year, depending on the method of calculating k. Atmospheric CO2 exchange is a large term in the C economy of the lake-the most conservative gas flux estimate is about four times as large as outflow plus seepage of total dissolved inorganic carbon and 1.5 times as large as the export of dissolved organic C from the lake.

ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA												28 Quaternary volcanoes, which scattered along a Quaternary NE strike fault, are found in the area of Halaha River and Chaoer River, middle of Daxing'an Mountain Range. Quaternary volcanic rocks in this area, mainly alkaline basalt, cover an area of ca. 1000 km(2). These volcanoes can be divided into two stages: Holocene volcanoes and Pliocene volcanoes. Both magmatic eruptions and phreatomagmatic eruptions are found in this area. The magmatic eruptions form a series of products, including scoria cones, tephra fallout deposits, and many kinds of lava (e. g. aa lava, pahoehoe lava and block lava). Typical fumarolic cones and lava hillocks are found in the lava. The phreatomagmatic eruptions have typical base surge deposits, which are characterized by parallel bedding and staggered bedding. Volcanic activity in this area form many volcanogenic lakes. According to the difference of lake forming, they are divided into four types: Crater lake, maar lake, volcanic dammed lake, collapse lava lake. Two conflict factors, water and fire, coexists harmoniously in the volcanic area, adding a splendid landscape to the Aershan Volcano and Warm Spring National Geopark.

J	Gafny, S; Gasith, A				Gafny, S; Gasith, A			Spatially and temporally sporadic appearance of macrophytes in the littoral zone of Lake Kinneret, Israel: taking advantage of a window of opportunity	AQUATIC BOTANY												We studied the spatial distribution and temporal appearance of submerged macrophytes in the littoral zone of Lake Kinneret in relation to various environmental factors from 1989-1992. In the summers of 1989 and 1990, following a whole decade of no significant macrophyte development, dense stands of Potamogeton pectinatus L. were recorded in limited littoral areas, mainly in the southeastern basin of the lake. Thereafter, in 1991 and 1992 no significant macrophyte growth was again recorded. We found that macrophyte stands are located at exactly the same places over the years. Specific requirements of sediment structure seem to be the key factor for this sporadic but conservative spatial distribution. The plants require clay-rich sediments covered by a 20 cm sand layer in order to develop. The variation in temporal appearance is mainly explained by the water level fluctuations and thus the related depth of the water column over a site of a given sediment structure. This depth should not be larger than 2 m. When both depth and sediment requirements are met, a window of opportunity is opened far the development of dense macrophyte stands. Otherwise, no significant development occurs. The maximal biomass gained by the macrophytes is associated with the length of the growing season, which in turn, is determined by the initial water level and the rate of lake level decline. The 'windows of opportunity' model is verified by a time series analysis of historical data on macrophyte development in Lake Kinneret, and should be further tested in the coming years.

However, previous research has primarily focused on annual distributions, lacking insight into its seasonal evolution. This study introduces a deep learning network, UNet-BM, to obtain weekly BM distributions across the GrIS from 2016 to 2020. However, little is known about the weekly BM distributions and its dynamic variations. Validation results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.87%, precision of 0.83, and a kappa score of 0.77, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous studies. The results reveal an average of 713 BM bodies per year, covering 523.94 km2, predominantly located in marginal areas at elevations of 800-1700 m. Over 80% of BM bodies are concentrated in the Center-West, North-West, and South-West basins. The reduction rates of BM range from 4.8-15.5 km2 per day. Approximately 27.22% of BM bodies disappear due to freezing or drainage, with higher disappearance rates in the northern GrIS (52.33% in the North and 37.2% in the Northeast). These findings enhance our understanding of BM dynamics and demonstrate the value of deep learning for monitoring englacial hydrology.																			1753-8947	1753-8955				DEC 31	2025	18	1							2513045	10.1080/17538947.2025.2513045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2025.2513045													WOS:001521166700001
J	Alexandrowicz, WP				Alexandrowicz, Witold Pawel			Molluscan assemblages in sediments of a landslide on Majerz Hill near Niedzica (Inner Carpathians, Southern Poland ) - phases of development and environmental changes	GEOLOGY GEOPHYSICS AND ENVIRONMENT												A detailed malacological analysis was made of sediments associated with a small landslide which had developed on the north-eastern slope of Majerz Hill near Niedzica (Inner Carpathians, Southern Poland). The age of the development and environmental changes associated with particular phases of the landslide was determined by means of radiocarbon dating. The analyses made it possible to distinguish two periods of landslide activation falling on the turn of the Early/Middle Holocene and on the Late Holocene (probably on the Iron Age Cold Period). These phases are closely related to periods of increased mass movements, both of landslides and debris flows in other European mountains, stages of glacial advance in the Alps, periods of increased fluvial activity in rivers and elevated water levels in European lakes. The molluscan assemblages also enabled the reconstruction of environmental conditions before the landslide formation, during periods of dormancy, and after the end of its activity.																			2299-8004	2353-0790					2022	48	1					51	68		10.7494/geol.2022.48.1.51	http://dx.doi.org/10.7494/geol.2022.48.1.51													WOS:000818563000004

A comparison of forest resource inventory, provincial land cover maps and field surveys for wildlife habitat analysis in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence forest	FORESTRY CHRONICLE												In a portion of central Ontario, Canada we assessed the classification agreement between field-based estimates of forest stand composition and each of two mapped data sources used in wildlife habitat studies, the Forest Resource Inventory (FRI) and satellite-image derived Provincial Land Cover (PLC). At two study areas, Algonquin Provincial Park (APP) and Wildlife Management Unit 49 (WMU49), we surveyed 119 forest stands and 40 water and wetland stands. Correspondence levels between FRI and field classifications were 48% in APP and 44% in WMU49 when assessing six forest cover types. With only four simplified forest cover types, levels improved to 77% in APP and 63% in WMU49. Correspondence between PLC and field classifications for three forested stand types was approximately 63% in APP and 55% in WMU49. Because of the poor to moderate level of correspondence we detected between map and field classifications, we recommend that care be exercised when FRI or PLC maps are used in forest and wildlife research and management planning.

Effects of nitrogen rates on chemical composition of yellow grape tomato grown in a subtropical climate	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Grape tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) are gaining popularity among consumers because of their flavor, sweetness, potential health benefits, and ease of consumption. Most grape tomatoes are indeterminate varieties. Hence, current production practices (including fertilization rates) may need to be adjusted to larger plants, longer growing seasons, and harvests over several months of the indeterminate varieties. The responses of physical (color and moisture content) and chemical [vitamin C, pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), carotenoids, and soluble solid content (SSC)] parameters for 'Honey Bunch' yellow grape tomato to nitrogen (N) rates were evaluated. In Spring 2005, tomatoes were grown on a Lakeland fine sand in North Florida using plasticulture and N rates of 0, 78, 157, 235, 314, and 392 kg/ha. Tomatoes were harvested fully ripen on 81 and 105 d after transplanting (DAT=0 on March 24th), and uniform 20-fruit samples were carefully selected. Increasing N rate significantly reduced vitamin C concentration from 44 to 35 mg/100 g and TTA from 0.47% to 0.38% citric acid, but did not significantly affect lutein (mean = 0.26 micro-g/g) and beta-carotene (mean = 0.82 micro-g/g) concentrations or color. Response of pulp pH to N rate was significant but within the narrow 4.5 to 4.7 range. Soluble solid contents decreased as N rate decreased for the first harvest (8.1 to 5.6 for 0 to 392 kg/ha of N), but increased for the second harvest (6.9 to 10.1 for 0 to 314 kg/ha of N). Overall, N rate did not have a marked effect on selected quality parameters, suggesting that variety and/or other environmental factors may be more important than N rate in determining chemical composition of grape tomato.					; Simonne, Amarat/AAW-5812-2020	Simonne, Amarat/0000-0003-1695-4389; 													0190-4167	1532-4087					2007	30	4-6					927	935		10.1080/15226510701375465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226510701375465													WOS:000247677500027

Burnt soils in the drainage basin of Sydney's principal water supply reservoir show enrichment in nutrient and trace element properties (Ca, Mg, P, K, Zn and Pb) in association with mineralization of organic matter. This work aims to explore the potential for using geochemical tracers to quantify the impact of severe wildfire on downstream sediment dynamics and further, to see if a useful record of changing river basin sediment dynamics is recorded in reservoir sediment. Whilst fire-induced changes in geochemistry appear to offer a useful means for discriminating surface sediment sources with respect to fire severity, comparison with the geochemical stratigraphy of the lake is hampered by variable sedimentation dynamics linked to water level fluctuation and overprinting of source signatures by process-related transformations. Further exploration of the factors affecting catchment source signatures and linkages within the system are required before the sedimentary record can be used to fall advantage.

Cooling processes in deep, temperate lakes: A review with examples from two lakes in British Columbia	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												The cooling period in deep, temperate lakes includes the breakdown of the seasonal thermodine, isothermal overturn as the lake cools through 4 degrees C, and winter restratification. The first part of this paper is taken up with a review of the relatively few studies on the seasonal cooling of lakes. From this it is clear that our understanding is weakest with regard to the mixing processes whereby heat is transferred from the interior of a lake to the surface where loss to the atmosphere takes place. There follows a comparison of the thermal history and mixing characteristics of two deep lakes in central British Columbia. Some features of thermal structure evolution can be explained within the framework of mixed-layer theory. At temperatures near 4 degrees C, however, it is necessary to take into account the unique PVT properties of freshwater. Two- and three-dimensional processes can also influence circulation at various times and/or locations: e.g., enhanced mixing associated with large-amplitude internal seiches; retardation of mixed-layer advance by river-induced upwelling; thermal bar circulation driven by the influx of cold river water; thermal bar circulation driven by the differential cooling of water in shallow, tributary bays; and horizontal density flows resulting from differential wind mixing in sheltered arms of the lake prior to freezing.																			0022-2402	1543-9542					1982	40			S			85	111																WOS:000207519300010

Record in Novosibirsk Region (Western Siberia)-The First in Asian Russia	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												In 2020, the first record of Wolffia arrhiza was made in Novosibirsk region (Western Siberia) in a floodplain lake. Wolffia arrhiza formed vast stands with an area of hundreds of square meters and with high productivity. Besides monodominant communities, it was met as a component of the cenoses of such hydrophytes as Stratiotes aloides and Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, as well as of the helophyte communities formed by Typha latifolia and Eleocharis mamillata. According to local residents, Wolffia was observed as abundant for some years; thus, most likely, the population winters safely at the latitude of Novosibirsk. The most likely source of Wolffia arrhiza appearance in the lake was an accidental introduction from an aquarium, although the possibility of this plant entering the lake in high-water years from the wastewater of the municipal settling tank of Novosibirsk sewage waters also exists.

Walter			Estimating winter ebullition bubble volume in lake ice using ground-penetrating radar	GEOPHYSICS												Freshwater lakes are an important source of atmospheric methane (CH4); however, uncertainties associated with quantifying fluxes limit the accuracy of climate warming projections. Among emission pathways, ebullition (bubbling) is the principal and most challenging to account for given its spatial and temporal patchiness. When lakes freeze, many methane-rich bubbles escaping from lake-bottom sediments are temporarily trapped by downward-growing lake ice. Because bubble position is then seasonally fixed, we postulate that it should be possible to locate bubbles using a geophysical approach sensitive to perturbations in the ice-water interface and ice sheet structure generated by bubbles. We use ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to noninvasively quantify the amount of ebullition gas present in lake ice. To do this, an appropriate petrophysical transformation is required that relates radar wave velocity and volumetric gas content. We use laboratory experiments to show that electromagnetic models and volumetric mixing formulas were good representations of the gas volume-permittivity relationship. We found a standard deviation in dielectric permittivity between the models of 0.03, 0.03, and 0.02 for 20%, 50%, and 70% gas content, respectively. Second, by combining two GPR geometries (common and multioffset), we were able to locate bubbles and estimate gas volume with low uncertainty, with +/-0.016 fV being the lowest uncertainty found and +/-0.199 fV the largest. Finally, we found that GPR reflection patterns were associated with different previously identified ice-bubble classes. These geophysical results coupled with ancillary field measurements and ice-growth models also suggest how GPR can contribute to estimates of seasonal and annual ebullition fluxes over large spatiotemporal scales within and among lakes, thereby helping to reduce uncertainties in upscaled estimates of ecosystem methane emissions.

It is newly reported from Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, with additional records given for Florida, Mississippi, and Texas. Although adults have been taken on cordgrasses, Spartina species, the bug's host-plant relationships have remained undocumented. During extensive sampling of spartinas and other grasses in the southern United States, I found nymphs of G. litoralis near the coast and inland only on three species of Spartina: sand cordgrass (S. bakeri), saltmeadow cordgrass (S. patens), and gulf cordgrass (S. spartinae). The mind was not observed on two less architecturally complex species, big cordgrass (S. cynosuroides) and smooth cordgrass (S. alterniflora). Seasonal history of G. litoralis was followed from 2002 to 2010 (19 visits) by periodically sampling an inland colony of sand cordgrass near Avon Park (Highlands County) in the Lake Wales Ridge of the Florida peninsula. The presence of early instars in November, December, February, and March suggests that reproduction continues during winter. The presence of adults in all months of fieldwork (January July; November, December), coupled with published records of adults from August to October, suggests that the bug is multivoltine.																			0013-8797					APR	2012	114	2					255	262		10.4289/0013-8797.114.2.255	http://dx.doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797.114.2.255													WOS:000304022800009

The disease is very common in India (Rao, 1933; Naik, 1942; Varma, 1954; Banerjee and Agarwal, 1991). The infection mostly occurs in bovine of three years old and above more during winter (Thakre and Bhilegaonkar, 1998), though sporadic cases are met with throughout the year. The prevalence of this infection is 17-60% in cattle and 2.6-90% in buffalo as repoted from various parts of the country (Sen, 1949; Rao and Devi, 1971). The Chhattisgarh area is blessed with plenty of rains and good soil. There are many water lodges, ponds and lakes which provide favourable environment for the multiplication of snails that acts as intermediate host for S. nasale. Keeping in view, the present study was undertaken to assess the, prevalence of nasal schistosomosis in bovine of Chhattisgarh area.																			0019-6479	0974-9365				JAN	2004	81	1					84	85																WOS:000220360100027

Spatial Patterning and Growth of Naturally Regenerated Eastern White Pine in a Northern Hardwood Silviculture Experiment	FORESTS												In forests dominated by deciduous tree species, coniferous species are often disproportionately important because of their contrasting functional traits. Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.), once a widespread emergent canopy species, co-occurs with deciduous hardwoods in the northern Lake States, but is often uncommon in contemporary hardwood stands. To gain insights into the potential utility of hardwood management strategies for simultaneously regenerating white pine, we leveraged a northern hardwood silvicultural experiment with scattered overstory pine. Seven growing seasons post-harvest, we conducted a complete census of white pine regeneration (height >= 30 cm) and mapped their locations and the locations of potential seed trees. Pine regeneration was sparse and strongly spatially aggregated, with most clusters falling within potential seed shadows of overstory pines. New recruits were found to have the highest density in a scarified portion of the study area leeward of potential seed trees. Low regeneration densities within treatment units, strong spatial aggregation, and the spatial arrangement of potential seed trees precluded generalizable inferences regarding the utility of specific treatment combinations. Nevertheless, our results underscore the critical importance of residual overstory pines as seed sources and highlight the challenges associated with realizing their potential in managed northern hardwoods.																				1999-4907				JUL 26	2025	16	8							1235	10.3390/f16081235	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f16081235													WOS:001558675900001

Hg2+ labelled with high specific activity Hg-197 was spiked to water samples in concentrations of 10 ng 1(-1), and incubated in laboratory for 3 d time trends under different conditions. Experimental water was sampled daily to evaluate CH3 Hg-197(+) production. Lake water used in the experiments was sampled just below the Upper limit of the metalimnion (similar to 30 m depth), where maximum values of chlorophyll a have been measured previously. Sampling was performed in late autumn, when the plankton fraction <50 mu m exhibited mercury concentrations up to 260 mu g g(-1) dry weight. The experiments analysed lake water filtered through 50, 20, and 0.2 mu m (filter-sterilized) mesh nets. ASTM grade 1 water was also incubated for control. All the experiments were run in an environmental chamber under controlled temperature and light regime. High Hg2+ conversion to CH3Hg+, up to 50%, was measured in take water, in a process stimulated by light. CH3Hg+ production was two-fold higher after 3 d of incubation with illumination compared to total darkness. Sterile lake water showed conversions up to 30%, while the planktonic components seem to enhance the CH3Hg+ production. Overall, our results provide evidence that lake Moreno waters favour CH3Hg+ production in processes stimulated by light. Although biotic components certainly contribute to enhance mercury methylation, water chemistry plays a key role in this process. We hypothesize that dissolved organic matter, particularly its quality, could be decisive. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we estimate the depth of 35 representative GrIS supraglacial lakes using ICESat-2, Sentinel-2 imagery and ArcticDEM data. ICESat-2-derived lake depth is used to validate the performance of three remote sensing methods, namely empirical formula method (EFM), radiative transfer method (RTM) and depression topography method (DTM). EFM relies on ICESat-2-derived lake depth to construct empirical formulas, while RTM and DTM do not. The results show that (1) the green band EFM performs best; the DTM performs secondarily but tends to consistently underestimate depths; the green-band RTM has lower accuracy and overestimates depths, while the red-band RTM also has lower accuracy but underestimates depths. (2) Temporal changes of depression topography have limited impacts on the performance of DTM, whereas the uncertainties caused by lake shoreline height estimates should be considered. (3) The performance of RTM is significantly influenced by the spectral attenuation coefficient. We further identify the factors that affect spatiotemporal extrapolation of these methods and recommend prioritizing the use of the EFM when near-simultaneous ICESat-2 data are available; otherwise, DTM is recommended, yet an underestimation ratio should be used.																			0022-1430	1727-5652				APR 2	2025	71								e41	10.1017/jog.2025.23	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2025.23													WOS:001473356200001

Two morphologically separated testes lobes, referred to as a cranial (major) and a caudal (minor) lobe, were identified and appeared to be identical to macroscopic structures which have been found in whitefish before. Surprisingly, we found these structures in all fish examined (n = 135 from four samplings). The histological structures of both cranial and caudal parts were described and found to be similar. Spermatozoa collected from both parts could be activated to a similar extent and exhibited similar parameters of swimming speed and trajectory. These results suggest that testes consisting of two separate parts are a normal morphological feature of whitefish testes from these Polish waters.

Because of their climate determinism, forest fires are likely to have consequences that could exacerbate biophysical and socioeconomical vulnerabilities in the context of climate change. We evaluated future trends in fire activity under climate change in the eastern Canadian boreal forest and investigated whether these changes were included in the variability observed during the last 7000 years from sedimentary charcoal records from three lakes. Prediction of future annual area burned was made using simulated Monthly Drought Code data collected from an ensemble of 19 global climate model experiments. The increase in burn rate that is predicted for the end of the 21st century (0.45% year(-1) with 95% confidence interval (0.32, 0.59) falls well within the long-term past variability (0.37 to 0.90% year(-1)). Although our results suggest that the predicted change in burn rates per se will not move this ecosystem to new conditions, the effects of increasing fire incidence cumulated with current rates of clear-cutting or other low-retention types of harvesting, which still prevail in this region, remain preoccupying.

Sustained Effects on Lung Function in Community Members Following Exposure to Hazardous PM2.5 Levels from Wildfire Smoke	TOXICS												Extreme wildfire events are becoming more common and while the immediate risks of particulate exposures to susceptible populations (i.e., elderly, asthmatics) are appreciated, the long-term health effects are not known. In 2017, the Seeley Lake (SL), MT area experienced unprecedented levels of wildfire smoke from July 31 to September 18, with a daily average of 220.9 mu g/m(3). The aim of this study was to conduct health assessments in the community and evaluate potential adverse health effects. The study resulted in the recruitment of a cohort (n= 95, average age: 63 years), for a rapid response screening activity following the wildland fire event, and two follow-up visits in 2018 and 2019. Analysis of spirometry data found a significant decrease in lung function (FEV1/FVC ratio: forced expiratory volume in first second/forced vital capacity) and a more than doubling of participants that fell below the lower limit of normal (10.2% in 2017 to 45.9% in 2018) one year following the wildfire event, and remained decreased two years (33.9%) post exposure. In addition, observed FEV(1)was significantly lower than predicted values. These findings suggest that wildfire smoke can have long-lasting effects on human health. As wildfires continue to increase both here and globally, understanding the health implications is vital to understanding the respiratory impacts of these events as well as developing public health strategies to mitigate the effects.

Antibodies against R. fennica were found in wild roach in lakes where fish are infected by the parasite. Antibody levels were higher in sera collected in September than in sera collected in June, due to infection of R. fennica during the late summer. In experimental aquarium studies, roach immunized with homogenized cercariae produced antibodies against R. fennica. An especially strong response was elicited by infecting fish with living cercariae emerging from infected clams. The specificity of the antibodies, as shown in Western blots, was different between fish immunized with homogenized cercariae and those fish infected with living cercariae. The specificity and amount of antibodies depended on the route of immunization. The challenge experiment with R. fennica indicated that previous infection of fish gives some protection against R. fennica.																			0031-1820					MAR	1997	114		3				285	291		10.1017/S0031182096008499	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182096008499													WOS:A1997WR19900011

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and PM10 solid particles above the water area of Lake Baikal in the summer of 2020	27TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS, ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				27th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics, Atmospheric Physics	JUL 05-09, 2021	Moscow, RUSSIA	Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, A M Obukhov Inst Atmospher Phys, Russian Acad Sci, M A Sadovsky Inst Geosphere Dynam, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V M Matrosov Inst Syst Dynam & Control Theory, MDPI, Atmosphere Open Access Journal, Solar Laser System, Photon Journal				This article presents the results obtained during the ship borne expedition throughout the water area of Lake Baikal from 29 July to 11 August 2020. We determined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the distribution of PAHs and PM10 in the atmosphere above the water area of Lake Baikal Aerosol above Lake Baikal consisted of submicron particles with the proportion of more than 90% of the total number concentration. The atmosphere above the water area of the northern basin Baikal showed background values of PAHs and high PM10 concentrations. When the wind direction changed from southwestern to northwestern, the PAH concentrations in smoke plumes from wildfires increased in the central and southern basins of Lake Baikal Among the 21 priority PAHs, phenanthrene, fluoranthene and benzo(b)fluoranthene prevailed in the aerosol.

J	Hagarová, I				Hagarova, Ingrid			Combination of Extraction Techniques and Spectrometric Methods Used for Separation, Preconcentration and Quantification of Silver Nanoparticles	CHEMICKE LISTY												The aim of this paper is to show the possibility to combine extraction techniques with commonly available spectrometric methods for selective separation, preconcentration and quantification of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the presence of their ionic species and other co-existing substances in real complex matrices. Herein, various modifications of liquid-liquid extraction (including cloud point extraction) and solid-phase extraction (including magnetic solid-phase extraction) are presented. Achieved results such as high extraction recoveries, acceptable precisions and low limits of detection lead to the conclusion that the procedures developed have a great analytical potential for reliable quantification of ultratrace AgNPs in various complex matrices. This conclusion was confirmed by analysis of real water samples (such as tap, lake, river, spring, sea, treated and untreated wastewaters), lixiviates obtained from sticking plasters and cleaning cloths, and commercially available antibacterial products (such as gels and sprays).

J	Kite, ES; Steele, LJ; Mischna, MA; Richardson, M				Kite, Edwin S.; Steele, Liam J.; Mischna, Michael A.; Richardson, Mark, I			Warm early Mars surface enabled by high-altitude water ice clouds	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Despite receiving just 30% of the Earth?s present-day insolation, Mars had water lakes and rivers early in the planet?s history, due to an unknown warming mechanism. A possible explanation for the >102-y-long lake-forming climates is warming by water ice clouds. However, this suggested cloud greenhouse explanation has proved difficult to replicate and has been argued to require unrealistically optically thick clouds at high altitudes. Here, we use a global climate model (GCM) to show that a cloud greenhouse can warm a Mars-like planet to global average annual-mean temperature (T) -265 K, which is warm enough for low-latitude lakes, and stay warm for centuries or longer, but only if the planet has spatially patchy surface water sources. Warm, stable climates involve surface ice (and low clouds) only at locations much colder than the average surface temperature. At locations horizontally distant from these surface cold traps, clouds are found only at high altitudes, which maximizes warming. Radiatively significant clouds persist because ice particles sublimate as they fall, moistening the subcloud layer so that modest updrafts can sustain relatively large amounts of cloud. The resulting climates are arid (area-averaged surface relative humidity -25%). In a warm, arid climate, lakes could be fed by groundwater upwelling, or by melting of ice following a cold-to-warm transition. Our results are consistent with the warm and arid climate favored by interpretation of geologic data, and support the cloud greenhouse hypothesis.					; Mischna, Michael/AAF-3861-2020	Richardson, Mark/0000-0001-9633-4141; 													0027-8424	1091-6490				MAY 4	2021	118	18							e2101959118	10.1073/pnas.2101959118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101959118								33903256					WOS:000647171500010
J	Zhang, XR; Zhang, HY				Zhang, Xu-Ran; Zhang, Hua-Yong			Holocene vegetation dynamics and climate reconstruction of Chahannur Lake in the Inner Mongolian Plateau: Pollen-based reconstructions	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Understanding Holocene vegetation dynamics and climate change is crucial for predicting future climate change and assessing vegetation dynamics. The Inner Mongolia Plateau, as an ecological barrier in northern China, holds significant research value for its Holocene vegetation and climate change. This study focuses on Chahannur Lake on the Inner Mongolia Plateau, reconstructing regional vegetation and climate using the biome and the Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares (WAPLS) methods. The results indicate that Holocene vegetation dynamics and climate change can be divided into four stages: The first stage (ca 10543-7813 cal. yr BP) was dominated by Artemisia, Poaceae, and Amaranthaceae, forming a sparse forest-steppe landscape combined with steppe (S) and cool deciduous forest (CDF). Mean annual precipitation (Pann) was 323.4 mm and mean annual temperature (Tann) was 4.8 degrees C, climate was cold-wet. The second stage (ca 7813-4425 cal. yr BP) was dominated by Betula, Quercus, and Ulmus, forming a broad-leaved forest-steppe landscape combined with S, temperate deciduous forest (TDF), and CDF. Pann was 357.6 mm and Tann was 5.91 degrees C, climate was warm-wet. The third stage (ca 4425-2125 cal. yr BP) was dominated by Artemisia, Poaceae, Amaranthaceae, and Betula, forming a sparse foreststeppe landscape combined with S and CDF. Pann was 288.7 mm and Tann was 5.28 degrees C, climate was cold-dry. The fourth stage (ca 2125-0 cal. yr BP) was dominated by Artemisia and Amaranthaceae dominating, forming a desert-steppe landscape. Pann was 253.1 mm and Tann was 5.47 degrees C, climate was warm-dry. Changes in regional vegetation, driven primarily by precipitation, were influenced by the intensity and extent of the East Asian summer monsoon. The results of vegetation and climate reconstruction support the view that the Middle Holocene represented the Holocene Optimum, providing new evidence for Holocene research on the Inner Mongolia Plateau.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2025	178								113980	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113980													WOS:001547743300006

Bacterial production relied mainly on allochthonous DOC and exceeded primary production in the epilimnion. Bacterial productivity was clearly stimulated during high flow episodes, increasing the input of bacteria degradable organic material to the lake. Bacterioplankton were exploited mainly by mixotrophic flagellates which probably used bacteria as a source of carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen. The possibly extremely low availability of inorganic P during periods with high bacterial production may have allowed the mixotrophs to outcompete obligate autotrophs and help them become dominant phytoplankters during large parts of the summer. The results from Lake Ortrasket indicated that the total production depended on bacterial energy mobilization from allochthonous organic carbon compounds and that heterotrophic mobilized energy was linked via mixotrophs to higher levels in the food chain.																			0003-9136					MAR	1999	144	4					409	428																WOS:000079743800002

Here we present observations from Lake Barleber for the period 1985-2016. The lake was treated in autumn 1986 because of high phosphorus (P) concentrations and cyanobacteria blooms, which limited the lake's recreational use. Within six weeks 480 t of Al sulphate solution (37 t of Al) were applied to the lake. This was equivalent to a dose of 36 g Al3+ m(-2) or 5.7 mg Al3+ L-1. Already after having applied half of the Al sulphate, the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) reached its analytical limit of quantification (3 mu g L-1). Removal rates calculated after completion of the treatment were 98% for SRP and 90% for total phosphorus (TP). In the following 13 years from 1987 to 1999, cyanobacteria were almost absent. In the years 2000 to 2003 as well as in 2005 and 2014 they appeared in low abundances. In the period 1987-2014, almost complete absence of cyanobacteria and high transparency provided good conditions for recreational use of Lake Barleber. Compared to pre-treatment conditions, phytoplankton biomass increased temporarily from 1987 to 2016. This increase in biomass did not interfere with the use for bathing and swimming, because phytoplankton community composition changed towards a dominance of chlorophytes and dinophytes. In 2016, however, P concentration and cyanobacterial biomass rose again to the level of the last pre-treatment years (TP 134 mu g L-1, cyanobacterial biomass 1 mg L-1; averages for the period May-October). We conclude that Al treatment is effective and can last for decades. For recreational lake use, the effects of the alum treatment on phytoplankton community composition showed to be more important than its effects on total phytoplankton biomass.

Manmade ponds are currently widespread in rural areas of the Cerrado and provide many ecosystem services such as cattle watering, fish production, irrigation and erosion protection. As in other parts of the world, ponds are also likely to play a critical role in the conservation of freshwater biodiversity, although in the Cerrado there is still very little known about their biota. Good water quality, in particular the level of eutrophication, is a key factor in maintaining aquatic biodiversity at the regional scale. Therefore, we aimed here to assess the water quality of ponds in the Cerrado. We also assessed whether the main types of socioeconomic pond uses have an impact on their water quality. We focused on measures of primary production and conducted socioeconomic inquiries for 56 waterbodies in the GoiA cent nia Cerrado region (GO, Brazil) at the beginning of the 2012 dry season. Overall, differences in water quality appeared to be linked to the type of pond use. The trophic level, as indicated by the chlorophyll concentration and conductivity, was greater in fish ponds and seemed to be related to management practices such as fish feeding and the type of water supply, in particular relatively low inflow volume. This contrasted with ponds used for cattle watering in extensive agricultural landscapes characterized by a low trophic level potentially beneficial for regional biodiversity. Good water quality in pasture ponds may be maintained by spring water inflow or heavy precipitation. Overall, the water quality of the Cerrado ponds was good compared with the same type of waterbodies in other regions of the world. These results highlight the high potential of the Cerrado ponds in extensive agricultural landscapes to provide an important habitat for aquatic biodiversity. Biodiversity inventories and assessments are now needed to increase our knowledge of these waterbodies and inform management activities at the local and regional scale.

We show here that nearly continuous daylight at high latitudes causes a relaxation in diel migratory behaviour in zooplankton irrespective of predation risk. At lower latitudes, however, similar conditions lead to pronounced diel rhythms in migration. Hence, zooplankton may show local behavioural adaptations in their circadian rhythm. They are also able to make risk assessments as to whether diel migration is beneficial or not, manifested in a lack of diel migration at near constant daylight, irrespective of predator presence. Our results provide an additional explanation to previous knowledge regarding diel migrations among aquatic invertebrates by showing that both physical (light) and biological (predation) factors may affect the migratory behaviour.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Fernández-Aláez, Camino/K-5292-2014; Kuoppamaki, Kirsi/E-8699-2015; Fernández-Aláez, Margarita/L-7321-2014; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/L-7321-2014; Becares, Eloy/H-6361-2015; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Kuoppamaki, Kirsi/0000-0002-6703-4024; Fernandez-Alaez, Camino/0000-0001-9385-1354; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Becares, Eloy/0000-0002-7123-3579; van de Bund, Wouter/0000-0002-2749-0850; Fernandez-Alaez, Margarita/0000-0003-3847-6613													0030-1299	1600-0706				APR	2007	116	4					585	591		10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15754.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15754.x													WOS:000245313500005
J	Moscatello, S; Belmonte, G				Moscatello, S; Belmonte, G			Active and resting stages of zooplankton and its seasonal evolution in a hypersaline temporary pond of the Mediterranean coast (the "Vecchia Salina", SE Italy)	SCIENTIA MARINA												The species composition of zooplankton and its variability were studied with all integrated water-sediment analysis for a period of two years in a hypersaline temporary pond in SE Italy. The basin was affected by extended drought during summer, and even during the wet period the sodium chloride salinity was never below 42.5parts per thousand The zooplankton showed the presence of seasonal species (mainly Anostraca), together with not seasonal, but opportunistic ones (mainly Rotifera, and Ciliophora) with a shorter life cycle. Rotifers (mainly Hexarthra fennica, and Proales similis), and ciliates (Fabrea salina) attained 99-100% of total planktonic organisms in certain periods. Resting stages were extracted from the upper 6 cm of 14 sediment cores collected during a dry period (August 1998). A total of 24 resting morphotypes (cysts) were listed-more than double the number of the active organisms (11) found in the plankton over the two years. The seasonal succession of species was different in the two years Studied. This fact, together with the richness of the cyst bank of the sediment, indicates that in each period the water Column shows only a portion of the biodiversity, which the sediment contains Unexpressed as resting stages. The Study of cyst distribution (both horizontal and vertical) in sediments provided complementary suggestions to understand the space-time distribution of the plankton organisms. Laboratory tests showed that hatching of different cysts generally occurred in a wide range of salinity conditions, and was not synchronous. This allowed US to assume that even the cyst hatching rate Could be an adaptation to highly variable extreme environments.

To better understand their fate and ecological risks in estuarine environments, this study investigated spatial distribution, seasonal variations, and the bioaccumulation potential of siloxanes in surface water, sediment, and in benthic organisms in an industrialized bay of Korea. Cyclic siloxanes exhibited higher concentrations than linear siloxanes across multiple environmental matrices, indicating their predominance and persistence. Water and sediment had distinct spatial distributions of siloxanes, which were influenced by local sources and hydrodynamic conditions. Industrial activities and power plant effluents were identified as major contributors to siloxane contamination in the coastal environment. Overall, the concentration of siloxanes in surface water was highest in winter. In particular, cyclic siloxanes showed a greater sensitivity to seasonal variation than linear siloxanes, with concentrations fluctuating significantly across sampling periods. The spatial distribution of siloxanes in sediment was strongly associated with organic carbon. Benthic invertebrates exhibited a strong potential for bioaccumulation of D5 and L9, with the highest bioaccumulation factors and biota-sediment accumulation factors among the detected compounds. These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring and management of siloxane contamination in industrialized estuarine environments.

J	McCarthy, K; Walker, L; Vigoren, L				McCarthy, K; Walker, L; Vigoren, L			Subsurface fate of spilled petroleum hydrocarbons in continuous permafrost	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Accidental releases of approximately 2000 m(3) of fuel have resulted in subsurface contamination adjacent to Imikpuk Lake, a drinking-water source near Barrow, AK. This paper presents a conceptual model of the distribution and transport of subsurface free-phase hydrocarbons at this site. The mean annual temperature in Barrow is - 13 degreesC, and average monthly temperatures exceed 0 degreesC only during the months of June, July, and August. As a result, the region is underlain by areally continuous permafrost that extends to depths of up to 300 m and constrains subsurface hydrologic processes to a shallow zone that temporarily thaws each summer. During the 1993 and 1994 thaw seasons, the measured depth of thaw varied across the site from approximately 0.5 to 2 m. However, exploratory borings in 1995 showed that free-phase hydrocarbons were present at depths greater than 3 in, indicating that permafrost at this site is not a barrier to the vertical migration of nonaqueous-phase liquids. In 1996, a subsurface containment barrier was installed to prevent lateral movement of contaminated water to Imikpuk Lake, and a recovery trench was excavated upgradient of the barrier to facilitate removal of free-phase hydrocarbons. Free-phase hydrocarbons were recovered from the trench during 1996, 1997, and 1998. Recovery rates diminished over this time, and in 1999, no further product was recovered and the recovery operation was halted. Subsequent exploratory borings in 2001 and 2002 have revealed that some product remains in the subsurface. Data indicate that this remaining product exists in small discrete pockets or very thin layers of hydrocarbon floating on brine. These small reservoirs appear to be isolated from one another by relatively impermeable permafrost. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Koue, J				Koue, Jinichi			Topographic Control of Wind- and Thermally Induced Circulation in an Enclosed Water Body	GEOSCIENCES												The dynamics of large lake circulations are strongly modulated by wind forcing, thermal gradients, and shoreline topography, yet their integrated effects remain insufficiently quantified. To address this, numerical simulations were conducted in Lake Biwa to clarify the mechanisms underlying wind- and thermally driven gyres, with a focus on the influence of bathymetric asymmetry. In wind-driven cases, zonal and meridional wind stress gradients were imposed, revealing that cyclonic wind shear generated strong surface vorticity (up to 2.0 x 10-6 s-1) in regions with gently sloped shores, while steep slopes suppressed anticyclonic responses. Cyclonic forcing induced upwelling in the lake center, with baroclinic return flows stabilizing the vertical circulation structure. In windless thermal experiments, surface temperature gradients of +/- 2.5 degrees C were applied to simulate seasonal heating and cooling. Cyclonic circulation predominated in warm seasons due to convergence and heat accumulation along gently sloping shores, whereas winter cooling produced divergent flows and anticyclonic gyres. The southern and eastern lake margins, characterized by mild slopes, consistently enhanced convergence and vertical mixing, while steep western and northern slopes limited circulation intensity. These results demonstrate that shoreline slope asymmetry plays a decisive role in regulating both wind- and thermally induced circulations, offering insights into physical controls on transport and stratification in enclosed lake systems.					; Koue, Jinichi/HHM-4256-2022	Koue, Jinichi/0000-0003-2542-614X; 														2076-3263				JUN 30	2025	15	7							244	10.3390/geosciences15070244	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences15070244													WOS:001539943000001

CyanoHABs have the potential to cause adverse effects on human health due to the production of cyanotoxins from cyanobacteria. Common routes of exposure include recreational exposure (swimming, skiing, and boating), ingestion, and aerosolization of contaminated water sources. Cyanotoxins have been shown to adversely affect several major organ systems contributing to hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal distress, and pulmonary inflammation. We present three pediatric case reports that coincided with CyanoHABs exposure with a focus on presentation of illness, diagnostic work-up, and treatment of CyanoHAB-related illnesses. Potential cyanotoxin exposure occurred while swimming in the Maumee River and Maumee Bay of Lake Erie in Ohio during the summer months with confirmed CyanoHAB activity. Primary symptoms included generalized macular rash, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and severe respiratory distress. Significant labs included leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. All patients ultimately recovered with supportive care. Symptoms following potential cyanotoxin exposure coincide with multiple disease states representing an urgent need to develop specific diagnostic tests of exposure.					; Mukundan, Deepa/AAA-1898-2020	Haller, Steven/0000-0002-6919-6342; 														2036-7449				DEC	2023	15	6					726	734		10.3390/idr15060065	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/idr15060065								37987403					WOS:001131465000001

The impact of wading and diving semi-aquatic predators on riverine fish populations is poorly known. We studied the effect of feral American mink predation on brown trout juveniles during winter in two experiments conducted in semi-natural streams (length 26 m, width 1.5 m). In the first experiment, we compared the vulnerability of age-1+ hatchery (length 142 +/- 16 mm, average +/- SD) and wild (112 +/- 8 mm) brown trout of similar genetic origin in sympatry and allopatry. In the second experiment we used age-0+ brown trout (79 +/- 5 mm), increased habitat heterogeneity by addition of fine wood, and compared those to treatments without fine wood addition. Hatchery fish were more vulnerable to mink predation than their wild counterpart, and the predation rate increased with increasing body size among the hatchery trout. Predation by mink on wild trout was higher in sympatric than in allopatric treatments suggesting that stocking of hatchery fish may increase predation on wild conspecifics. Increased habitat heterogeneity resulted in reduced predation rate. The results show that a large size of hatchery fish in small streams was a negative trait, which was opposite to the mainstream observations of salmonid stockings made directly of feeding areas in lakes and oceans. Adding habitat heterogeneity was found important for habitat enhancements in streams with mammalian predators. We highlight the importance of taking all the habitats during the life cycle of migratory fish into account in management decisions and carefully considering whether using hatchery fish to support wild populations in streams.

Modelling Holocene analogues of coastal plain estuaries reveals the magnitude of sea-level threat	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Hydrodynamic modelling of Australia's lower Murray River demonstrates the response of a large coastal plain estuary to the mid-Holocene (7,000-6,000 yr BP) sea-level highstand. The approximately two metre higher-than-present sea level during the highstand forced the estuarine limit upstream generating an extensive central basin environment extending more than 200 kilometres from the river mouth (143 kilometres upstream of the modern tidal limit). The geomorphic history of the region does not conform to conventional estuarine facies models as, for much of the Holocene, the lower Murray River acted as a landward, gorge-confined extension of the Murray estuary. The incredibly low relief of this coastal plain system drove significant saline incursion and limited current velocities across the estuary facilitating deposition of a laminated silt-clay sequence which our results suggest may be regionally extensive. Variations to discharge, barrier morphology, or the estuary's bathymetry result in minimal change to the estuarine palaeo-environment. The shift to the present-day fresher water distribution in the Murray estuary requires a fall in sea level to present-day conditions. The dominance of sea level as the controlling factor on this estuarine palaeo-environment highlights the significant potential impact of climate change induced sea-level rise to coastal plain estuaries.

Two-gram samples from each stratum underwent a 12-hour digestion, and concentrations were determined using Microwave Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer. Results indicated that Cu, Fe, and Zn concentrations fell within Food and Agricultural Organization and World Health Organization safety limits. Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) and Hazard Quotient (THQ) values for males and females remained under recommended thresholds, suggesting minimal health risks from consumption. Element concentrations followed the order Fe > Zn > Cu, all below Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs). THQ values, with Zn posing the highest potential risk followed by Fe and Cu, were under one. Overall, the Hazard Index (HI) was 0.02, signifying a low non-carcinogenic risk from fish consumption. Despite safety, ongoing monitoring of heavy metal accumulation in the ecosystem is advisable for long-term safety. In conclusion, trace element levels in Limnothrissa miodon from Lake Kariba are safe for human consumption with low associated health risks. Nonetheless, continued monitoring of heavy metal levels is vital.

The process of wave generation induced by far subaerial granular landslide has been investigated through series physical experiments. The slide Froude number has been quantified considered the parameters of slide mass and water such as grain size, water depth and impact angle. The effect of impact angle, grain size and water depth on the variation of generated wave amplitude is 0.11%, 1.52% and 2.89% respectively when every 1% change in the value of the parameter. On the three governing parameters the water depth is the most sensitive to the wave amplitude, secondly the grain size and final for the impact angle. The intruding pattern of granular debris, the landslide generated wave types and maximum wave amplitude have been systematically discussed. The degree of impact interaction between the slides and water under different conditions is characterized by the value of the slide Froude number, and the empirical relationships linking the slide Froude number with the produced wave amplitude and wave classifi-cations have been conducted based on experimental data, which is useful to illustrate the triggering mechanisms and dynamic process of impact landslide waves on high debris avalanches.					; li, haibo/IYS-4740-2023; Zhou, Jia-wen/A-7807-2012	li, haibo/0000-0002-9452-9452; Zhou, Jia-wen/0000-0002-6817-1071													0029-8018	1873-5258				OCT 1	2022	261								112142	10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.112142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.112142		AUG 2022											WOS:000864742800004

In this area, increasing numbers of the geese are causing damage to wheat crops. The effects of several factors on the unconsumed density of food resources in rice fields, their main foraging site, were investigated with a view to propose a method for reducing damage. It is shown that unconsumed rice grain density increased with decreasing distance from houses, roads and windbreaks, which seemed to act as disturbance factors. Unconsumed rice density was also affected by the type of harvester used, probably because of the difference in net intake rate between the sites where different types of harvester operated. It is recommended that rice fields be harvested using the current machinery, and located further from houses, roads and windbreaks, wheat fields being located nearer to houses, roads and windbreaks.

J	Nagy-Göde, FK; Török, A				Nagy-Gode, Fruzsina Kapolnaine; Torok, Akos			Types of Landslides along Lake Balaton, Hungary	PERIODICA POLYTECHNICA-CIVIL ENGINEERING												Landslides are often triggered by various mechanisms such as precipitation, increase in the groundwater table, surface load, etc. and are classified according to the geometry and intensity of the motion. This paper provides an inventory considering all these factors by interpreting landslide records and available maps of the lakeside banks of the largest lake in Central Europe, Lake Balaton. Landslides in these areas severely damaged roads and railway networks. These disasters are linked to the mass movements of hundreds of m3 in the past years. The study area, the coastal regions of the lake, is divided into three geographically and geologically different sections (Eastern Basin, North Coast, South Coast). The landslide forms and the proportion of various movements and their timing also differ in these areas: at the south coast, falls and toppling prevail, while in the eastern basin, slidings prevail. The leading cause of mass movements is soaking and human interventions in all areas. Continuous monitoring of these landslide-prone areas contributes to the prediction of sliding and help in the design of remediation actions.

However, the nature of precipitation changes and their driving mechanisms in this region during the last millennium remain unclear. We conducted a pollen study of the recent sediments of Moon Lake in Northeast China to quantitatively reconstruct precipitation changes over the past similar to 1000 years. The results show that during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP, 1068-1300 CE), the Moon Lake area had a relatively dense vegetation cover and experienced favorable climatic conditions. Precipitation increased during this period, with an average precipitation anomaly percentage (PAP) of 0.1% which reached a peak of 7.2%. However, during the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1400-1900 CE), the climatic conditions in the Moon Lake area deteriorated, and there was a reduction in the cover of forest vegetation and relatively open landscapes developed. Precipitation decreased during this period, with an average PAP of -1.4% which reached a minimum of -9.9%. During the 20th-century warming period (CWP, 1900 CE-present), the regional environmental conditions improved substantially, and the density of the forest vegetation increased. Precipitation increased, with an average PAP of 1.1% and maximum of 11.1%. Additionally, the Moon Lake area exhibited several prominent short-term (centennial- to decadal-scale) climate fluctuations over the last millennium. Drought events, characterized by negative precipitation anomalies, occurred during 1070-1130 CE, 1150-1190 CE, 1370-1420 CE, 1660-1720 CE, and 1870-1930 CE. These climate anomalies also occurred in northern China, with significant impacts on the socioeconomic well-being of the local population. We suggest that changes in EASM intensity, modulated by solar activity, were responsible for these anomalies. Solar activity directly or indirectly drives increases (decreases) in sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, which lead to cold (warm) phases of the El Ni & ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), as well as to warm (cold) phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), as occurred during the MWP (LIA). This complex interaction alternately strengthens (weakens) the EASM intensity, resulting in northward (impeded northward) shifts of the monsoon rainbelt, which led to increased (decreased) precipitation in the Moon Lake area during the MWP (LIA). Furthermore, we propose that the anomalous warm PDO phases and anomalous AMO cold phases may act as a driver of the occurrence of extreme drought events on the centennial- to decadal-scale. We suggest that these cold and warm fluctuations of the PDO and AMO should be the focus of research attempts to predict future climate extreme events.

In situ reciprocal transplants reveal species-specific growth pattern and geographic population differentiation among zebra and quagga mussels	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												For bivalves, somatic growth is often inferred from shell measurements alone. However, shell growth may not always reflect changes in soft tissue due to confounding factors such as seasonal or ontogenetic asynchrony between shell and tissue, flexible energy allocation, or population differences. This study compares the relationship between shell growth, changes in soft tissue mass, and RNA/DNA ratio in the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) from contrasting riverine and brackish estuarine environments. Reciprocal transplantation indicated that shell growth in late summer was consistently lower for the estuarine source zebra mussels while the RNA/DNA ratio was highest for zebra mussels independent of either geographic source or destination. Shell growth of the river source quagga mussels was almost two times greater than zebra mussels at the river site, but both shell growth and final tissue mass were lower in the estuarine environment. While there were no differences in final RNA/DNA ratios between zebra and quagga mussels from the same source, the RNA/DNA ratio of zebra mussels from the estuary and transplanted to the estuary was higher than that of all other zebra mussel treatments. This study suggests that shell growth does not always accurately reflect tissue growth and that the shell and tissue growth of quagga mussels is greater than that of zebra mussels in fresh but not brackish waters, and that physiological plasticity can have a fixed geographic component (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	WEST, RG				WEST, RG			ON THE HISTORY OF THE LATE DEVENSIAN LAKE SPARKS IN SOUTHERN FENLAND, CAMBRIDGESHIRE, ENGLAND	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												A section in a gravel quarry at Somersham, Cambridgeshire, has revealed evidence for a lake, named Lake Sparks, in Fenland during the Late Devensian substage of the Pleistocene. Varved sediments were deposited in this lake over a minimum period of ca. 65 yr. The varved clays contain red diamicton clasts, interpreted as dump, delivered to the area by icebergs or floes from the ice-front in the Wash that deposited the Hunstanton Till. The lake is therefore considered a result of impounding by the Late Devensian ice advance on the east coast. A small number of pale varves have a characteristic structure indicating increased calcite deposition in the summer. They are interpreted as a result of cooler summers with reduced gelifluction from the surrounding Jurassic (Ampthill) Clay. Such gelifluction introduced a mudflow into the varved sequence at the southern end of the section. Pollen analysis confirms the derivation of the clays from the surrounding Ampthill Clay. The varved clays are succeeded by fluviatile sediments related to a delta building into the lake from the north. The delta sediments show periodic influx of sand into the lake interrupted by quiet periods with the development of Chara meadows. A thin spread of fluviatile gravels succeed the delta sediments, indicating the development of a braided river plain as the lake drained on the melting of the Late Devensian ice. This was followed by permafrost development, with the formation of thin thermal contraction cracks and coversand deposition. Later, degradation of the permafrost was associated with the formation of diapirs and a solifluction mantle, and incision of the fluviatile and lacustrine sediments took place. Flandrian peat and marl later filled the valley so formed. A radiocarbon date of 18310(-1440)+1980 yr BP from Salix leaves in a drift mud at the top of channel sands preceding lake sediment, in a neighbouring section, confirms the relation of the lake to the Late Devensian ice advance. The significance of the Late Devensian sediments at Somersham lies in the information they give on the timing and variety of processes related to drainage and ice movement in the period before, during and after the ice advance to the Wash. A period of low deposition rate in the lake was followed by rapid delta sedimentation and lake drainage, with implications for climatic change.																			0267-8179					SEP	1993	8	3					217	234		10.1002/jqs.3390080304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3390080304													WOS:A1993MF99600003

The use of the eco-strategists approach, based on ecophysiological work and field observations, allowed us to explain the differences in the distribution pattern and temporal dynamics of both cyanobacterial complexes. Spatial differences were produced due to much higher and fluctuating cyanobacterial abundances at the right margin of the reservoir and at the littoral areas closer to the dam. Satellite imagery (LANDSAT 5 TM) clearly depicted the stronger algal development in the reservoir arms and in the section closer to the dam. The Microcystis spp. complex achieved higher density than the Dolichospermum spp. complex. We hypothesise that the hydrological cycle explains the inter-annual fluctuations of the intensity and frequency of cyanobacterial blooms, and that spatial differences in cyanobacterial presence between the reservoir arms, its margins and the main channel is mainly a response to morphometrical and hydrological characteristics.

Investigation of nanoparticles in Lake Zurich by microscopic methods showed that relatively large numbers of clay particles are present with different AI/Si composition and sizes. The smallsized clay particles (ca. 80 nm) tend to build aggregates with a size of 500-1,000 nm. In karstic spring water, the particle count and size distribution is strongly dependent on the precipitation rate. At high precipitation rates, channel flow occurs in the subsoil, leading to high particle counts among the whole size range and a larger average particle size. In membrane treatment by microfiltration and ultrafiltration this leads to membrane fouling due to pore blocking and cake formation, the latter being associated with the presence of organic compounds.																			1606-9749		1-84339-565-7				2006	6	1					21	29		10.2166/ws.2006.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2006.004													WOS:000239059800003

This is because some of the contemporary changes to climate are abrupt and result in persistent changes in the state of natural systems; so called regime shifts (RS). This study aimed to detect and analyse the timing and strength of RS in Estonian climate at the half-century scale (1966-2013). We demonstrate that the extensive winter warming of the Northern Hemisphere in the late 1980s was represented in atmospheric, terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems to an extent not observed before or after the event within the studied time series. In 1989, abiotic variables displayed statistically significant regime shifts in atmospheric, river and marine systems, but not in lake and bog systems. This was followed by regime shifts in the biotic time series of bogs and marine ecosystems in 1990. However, many biotic time series lacked regime shifts, or the shifts were uncoupled from large-scale atmospheric circulation. We suggest that the latter is possibly due to complex and temporally variable interactions between abiotic and biotic elements with ecosystem properties buffering biotic responses to climate change signals, as well as being affected by concurrent anthropogenic impacts on natural environments.

The estimated age of the crater ranges widely from less than 12 ka to over 600 ka, but the crater preserves a relatively pristine morphology. We conducted a study of various drainage systems of Lonar Crater. The crater floor hosts a shallow 5-m-deep lake, which fluctuates seasonally. Our investigation reveals that the lake level is influenced by surface runoff that is active during the monsoon and groundwater input effective during both the rainy and the dry seasons. The groundwater discharge is observed as springs on the inner rim walls corresponding to weathered vesicular basalt and/or proximal ejecta, which are underlain by thick massive basalt layers. This observation indicates that groundwater movement is lithologically controlled: it passes preferentially through permeable vesicular basalt or proximal ejecta but is hindered in less permeable massive basalt. It is hypothesized that groundwater is also structurally controlled by dipping of basalt layers, interconnectivity of the permeable lithologic units through fractures, and preferential pathways such as fractures within the permeable lithologic units. Investigation on hydrological processes at Lonar Crater and its lake could provide useful insights into purported paleo-crater lakes presumably formed in the basaltic crust of Mars. The Lonar Crater interior shows signs of degradation in the forms of gullies and debris flows, and the Dhar valley incising in the rim leading to form a fan delta. The ejecta surface is characterized by the presence of channels, originating from the rim area and extending radially away from the crater center. The channels probably resulted from surface runoff, and its erosion contributes to the removal of the ejecta. Lunar Crater is a valuable analog site for studying degradation processes with potential application to impact craters occurring on hydrologically active ancient Mars, or to other impact craters on Earth.

Lakes, streams, rivers, and ponds were sampled with Moore swabs bi-monthly for over 2 years at 30 locations in the vicinity of a leafy green growing region on the Central California Coast and screened for Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Salmonella enterica, and Listeria monocytogenes to evaluate the prevalence and persistence of pathogen subtypes. The prevalence of STEC from 1386 samples was 11%; 110 samples (8%) contained E. coli O157:H7 with the highest prevalence occurring close to cattle operations. Non-O157 STEC isolates represented major clinical O-types and 57% contained both shiga toxin types 1 and 2 and intimin. Multiple Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis of STEC isolates indicated prevalent strains during the period of study. Notably, Salmonella was present at high levels throughout the sampling region with 65% prevalence in 1405 samples resulting in 996 isolates with slightly lower prevalence in late autumn. There were 2, 8, and 14 sites that were Salmonella-positive over 90, 80, and 70% of the time, respectively. The serotypes identified most often were 6,8:d:-, Typhimurium, and Give. Interestingly, analysis by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis indicated persistence and transport of pulsotypes in the region over several years. In this original study of L. monocytogenes in the region prevalence was 43% of 1405 samples resulting in 635 individual isolates. Over 85% of the isolates belonged to serotype 4b with serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, 3a, 4d with 4e representing the rest, and there were 12 and 2 sites that were positive over 50 and 80% of the time, respectively. Although surface water is not directly used for irrigation in this region, transport to the produce can occur by other means. This environmental survey assesses initial contamination levels toward an understanding of transport leading to produce recalls or outbreaks.					; Mandrell, Robert/O-9814-2018	Gorski, Lisa/0000-0003-2387-1012; Quinones, Beatriz/0000-0001-5010-9889													2235-2988					MAR	2014	4								30	10.3389/fcimb.2014.00030	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2014.00030								24624367					WOS:000336120000007

Toxicity of the water bloom material for mice was detected in 9 cases. The maximal tolerable doses (MTD) of the material extracted from biomass varied within 3-30 mg kg(-1) mouse body weight; 50% lethal doses (LD(50)) were within 45-125 mg kg(-1). Toxic water blooms were registered in Karelian lakes and in the Neva Bay, Gulf of Finland. Cyanobacterial samples collected on the eastern coast of Lake Ladoga proved to be non-toxic. The species identified in toxic bloom material included Anabaena circinalis, A. flos-aquae, A. lemmermannii, Anabaena sp., Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Gloeotrichia echinulata, G. pisum, Microcystis aeruginosa and Oscillatoria sp. These data suggest that toxic forms of cyanobacteria are widespread in Karelian lakes belonging to the drainage basin of Lake Ladoga.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					149	151		10.1007/BF00031820	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031820													WOS:A1996UT84700024

However, the traditional temperature proxies derived from marine LCKs may not be able to address the problem related to the prevalent species effect, which restricts the application of LCKs in lacustrine studies. In our LCK record from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, C-37/C-38 differences revealed that the LCK producer species in Lake Qinghai may have changed during the Holocene. This possible species effect may have caused inconsistency between the U-37(K') and U-37(K) records. Therefore, we formulated a new proxy, U-37(Ks), with a parameter "s" to indicate the different exponential response in LCK unsaturation to temperature change in multiple species. Our U-37(Ks)-derived temperature time series resembles the general temperature trends of the Northern Hemisphere on a millennial scale, while exhibiting several apparent cold events, especially at ca. 9 ka. The result shows that the Holocene optimum in Lake Qinghai was interrupted by cold events in the early Holocene. This could be a result of a weak Asia summer monsoon and cold air transmission in the North Atlantic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This mainly consists of mud and boiling pools, fumaroles, which are mainly located in the northwestern bank of the crater lake. During the period 1998-2000, hot springs and fumaroles discharging inside the crater and from the southeastern outer flank (Agua Caliente) were collected for chemical analyses. The observed chemical fluctuations suggest that the physico-chemical boundary conditions regulating the thermodynamic equilibria of the deep rock/fluid interactions have changed with time. The chemical composition of the lake water, characterised in the period 1983-1997 by high Na+, Cl-, Ca2+ and SO42- contents, experienced a dramatic change in 1998-1999, turning from a Na+-Cl-- to a Ca2+-SO42- -rich composition. In June 2000, a relatively sharp increase in Na+ and Cl- contents was observed. At the same time, SO2/H2S ratios and H-2 and CO contents in most gas discharges increased with respect to the previous two years of observations, suggesting either a new input of deep-seated fluids or local variations of the more surficial hydrothermal system. Migration of gas manifestations, enhanced number of emission spots and variations in both gas discharge flux and outlet temperatures of the main fluid manifestations were also recorded. The magmatic-hydrothermal system of El Chichon is probably related to interaction processes between a deep magmatic source and a surficial cold aquifer; an important role may also be played by the interaction of the deep fluids with the volcanic rocks and the sedimentary (limestone and evaporites) basement. The chemical and physical changes recorded in 1998-2000 were possibly due to variations in the permeability of the conduit system feeding the fluid discharges at surface, as testified by the migration of gas and water emanations. Two different scenarios can be put forward for the volcanic evolution of El Chichon: (1) build-up of an infra-crater dome that may imply a future eruption in terms of tens to hundreds of years; (2) minor phreatic-phreatomagmatic events whose prediction and timing is more difficult to constrain. This suggests that, unlike the diminished volcanic activity at El Chichon after the 1982 paroxistic event, the volcano-hydrothermal fluid discharges need to be more constantly monitored with regular and more frequent geochemical sampling and, at the same time, a permanent network of seismic stations should be installed.

J	Li, XH; Zhang, Q; Zhang, D; Ye, XC				Li, Xianghu; Zhang, Qi; Zhang, Dan; Ye, Xuchun			Investigation of the drought-flood abrupt alternation of streamflow in Poyang Lake catchment during the last 50 years	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) is one of the remarkable manifestations of the summer monsoon anomaly at the subseasonal scale and can result in severe damage. This study identified and analyzed DFAA in terms of streamflow in the Poyang Lake catchment over the last 50 years based on a DFAA index (DFAAI). The study also investigated the intra-annual distribution characteristics and long-term tendencies associated with DFAA, as well as the relationship with precipitation patterns. A statistical analysis showed that drought-to-flood events in the Poyang Lake catchment generally occur in March and April, while flood-to-drought events occur in July and August. A Mann-Kendall test indicated a long-term decreasing trend in DFAAI in March and April and a slight increasing trend in July and August; however, the trends were not statistically significant. Flood-to-drought events occurred more frequently than did drought-to-flood events at the decadal scale, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. The particular distribution of precipitation in the Poyang Lake catchment mainly determined the occurrence patterns of DFAA events, but intensive human activities are also significant factors that have decreased and mitigated DFAA disasters since the 1980s in the Poyang Lake catchment.

Environmental impact of the 1.8 ka Taupo eruption, New Zealand: Landscape responses to a large-scale explosive rhyolite eruption	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY					17th International Sedimentological Congress	AUG 27-SEP 01, 2006	Fukuoka, JAPAN					Large-scale ignimbrite eruptions from rhyolitic caldera volcanoes can trigger geologically instantaneous changes in sedimentary systems over huge areas by either burying existing environments or overloading them with vast quantities of unconsolidated particulate material. The post-eruption readjustment of the landscape to such perturbations is one of the most dramatic processes in physical sedimentology, exemplified here by the 1.8 ka Taupo eruption in the central North Island of New Zealand. This eruption generated voluminous fall deposits, then climaxed with emplacement of a c. 30 km(3) non-welded ignimbrite over a near-circular area of c. 20 000 km(2). Approximately 90% of the area, but <50% of the ignimbrite volume, is represented by a landscape-mantling unit that covered the pre-eruption topography to a depth varying from c. 10 m in proximal areas to less than 15-30 cm distally. The remainder of the ignimbrite deposit is represented by landscape-modifying material that ponded in valley bottoms and depressions to thicknesses of up to 70 m, with no systematic variation in thickness with distance from source. The headwaters of many of the North Island's largest rivers were impacted by both the primary pyroclastic fall and flow material. Large-scale post-eruption remobilisation of this material, coupled with the reestablishment of fluvial systems, occurred in a distinct sequence as recorded by the evolution of sedimentary facies in different sub-environments. Following an initial period dominated by mass flows, re-establishment of fluvial systems began with the headward erosion of box canyons through the ponded ignimbrite deposits, a process often associated with the break-out of temporary lakes. Aggradational streams developed in these channels rapidly evolved from shallow, ephemeral, sediment-laden outbursts associated with. ash flood events to deeper, permanent braided rivers, before declining sediment yields led to retrenchment of single thread rivers and a return to pre-eruption gradients and bedloads years to decades later. Typically the modern pro. le of many streams and rivers follow closely their pre-eruption profiles, and incision and erosion is overwhelmingly confined to the deposits of the eruption itself. Although the general remobilisation pattern is similar for all impacted river systems, detailed studies of the Waikato, Rangitaiki, Mohaka, Ngaruroro and Whanganui catchments show that the relative timing and scale of each eruption response phase differs between each catchment. These reflect differences in catchment physiography and hydrology, and the volume and type of pyroclastic material deposited in each. Ultimately, the landscape response reflects the relative spatial distributions of, and the volumetric ratios between, the volumes of pyroclastic debris, water, and accommodation space in the basin (cf. Kataoka and Manville, this volume). (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Naiman, RJ; Latterell, JJ				Naiman, R. J.; Latterell, J. J.			Principles for linking fish habitat to fisheries management and conservation	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												A set of eight simple ecological and social principles is proposed that could enhance the understanding of what constitutes fish 'habitat' and, if implemented, could contribute to improved management and conservation strategies. The habitat principles are a small, interrelated sub-set that may be coupled with additional ones to formulate comprehensive guidelines for management and conservation strategies. It is proposed that: 1) habitat can be created by keystone species and interactions among species; 2) the productivity of aquatic and riparian habitat is interlinked by reciprocal exchanges of material; 3) the riparian zone is fish habitat; 4) fishless headwater streams are inseparable from fish-bearing rivers downstream; 5) habitats can be coupled - in rivers, lakes, estuaries and oceans, and in time; 6) habitats change over hours to centuries; 7) fish production is dynamic due to biocomplexity, in species and in habitats; 8) management and conservation strategies must evolve in response to present conditions, but especially to the anticipated future. It is contended that the long-term resilience of native fish communities in catchments shared by humans depends on incorporating these principles into management and conservation strategies. Further, traditional strategies poorly reflect the dynamic nature of habitat, the true extent of habitat, or the intrinsic complexity in societal perspectives. Forward-thinking fish management and conservation plans view habitat as more than water. They are multilayered, ranging from pools to catchments to ecoregions, and from hours to seasons to centuries. They embrace, as a fundamental premise, that habitat evolves through both natural and anthropogenic processes, and that patterns of change may be as important as other habitat attributes.

J	Okuno, M; Nakamura, T				Okuno, M; Nakamura, T			Radiocarbon dating of tephra layers: recent progress in Japan	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												A large number of tephra layers deposited over the past 40,000 years in Japan have been studied by means of newly developed techniques as well as the traditional radiocarbon (C-14) method. The samples for C-14 dating were commonly charcoal and wood directly covered or involved in tephra-fall and pyroclastic flow deposits. Recently, the C-14 dates measured for paleosols directly underlying a tephra layer have proved to represent the accurate eruption age of the tephra, and have successfully established the high-resolution eruptive histories of several volcanoes. In addition, oceanic and lacustrine sediments have preserved a large number of tephra layers, and accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 measurements on terrestrial macrofossils from varved sediments have provided highly accurate ages for tephra layers. Wiggle matching of C-14 ages from several horizons of peat sediments to INTCAL98 calibration data that was established by dendrochronology as well as by varve chronology has enabled us to obtain highly accurate ages of tephras intercalated in the peat deposits.

Synoptic climatology of the early 21st century drought in the Colorado River Basin and relationships to reservoir water levels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Since the year 2000, streamflows throughout the Colorado River Basin (CRB) in the southwestern United States have been greatly impacted by a prolonged drought. As a primarily mountain snowmelt-sourced basin, the climatic drivers of annual runoff in the CRB bear significant influence on the hydrologic status of its network of reservoirs. To analyse reservoir response to the drought, this study takes a holistic approach of relating the frequency of mid-tropospheric circulation patterns (CPs) to water levels at Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the primary reservoirs in the CRB. A synoptic climatology of the region was constructed by classifying daily mean 500-hPa geopotential height values from 1982 to 2012, a span that includes the early 21st century drought and the relatively wetter years preceding it, to determine how the drought manifests itself in the trends of CPs over time. The CPs were then statistically compared to several measures of reservoir water level, including yearly inflow and net changes in storage year-to-year, to examine potential relationships. The results of the classification reveal that the CRB is most notably characterized by dominant summertime ridge patterns, which have become slightly more common during the drought. Cool season troughs were generally linked with the presence of more water in the reservoirs, but ridges have stronger relationships to reservoir variables, including linkages to years with lower reservoir inflow, greater yearly losses, and net declines in storage year-to-year. Further, dry transitional patterns, CPs which represent zonal flow yielding little precipitation, are increasingly common in the spring, coming at the expense of wetter CPs. These results support previous research regarding the observed hastening of snowmelt, contributing to the early 21st century drought in the CRB as well as the overall trend in declining mountain snowpack across western North America.

Invertebrates	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												Materials on the aquatic invertebrate fauna in the Maly Patok River basin (the western slopes of the Subpolar Urals) have been presented. These water bodies, which maintain the natural hydrological regime, are located on the territory of the Yugyd-Va National Park. A total of 108 taxa (except for Chironomidae) in the zoobenthos samples and the invertebrate qualitative collections taken in the summer periods in 1996, 2000-2007, and 2017 are identified. Among them, amphibiotic insects prevail in the watercourses, while oligochaetes and mollusks dominate in the lakes in regards to number of species. Mayflies of the families Baetidae and Heptageniidae, stoneflies of Perlodidae, caddisflies of Rhyacophilidae and Apataniidae, and the Elmidae beetles are mostly present in the rivers. Oligochaetes of Naididae and mollusks of the families Planorbidae and Sphaeriidae are most abundant and diverse in the lakes. The most frequent species have Palearctic (29.0%) and Holarctic (25.5%) habitat ranges. In addition to the widespread European species, some species are recorded that have the largest part of their ranges in Siberia. Rare species in the fauna composition have been revealed.

This work presents information on abundance and habitat use of the species that inhabit water bodies in the highlands of western Santa Cruz province, Argentina. Surveys were conducted during four austral summers ( January to March) from 2010 to 2013, with annual data collected at 378 lakes. Results indicate that species distribution varies from year to year. The most abundant species was Baird's Sandpiper (Calidris bairdii). Habitat modeling showed that this species favors 'depression' type lakes and that individuals do not distribute uniformly across the area, with higher yearly abundance at Strobel Plateau and the plateaus of the 'Austral complex'. Size of the water body is positively related to abundance of White-rumped Sandpiper (C. fuscicollis) and Wilson's Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor). Results show that these highlands are sites of interest for the conservation of migratory shorebirds.					imberti, santiago/MNQ-0206-2025; Roesler, Ignacio/JDW-7654-2023														1524-4695	1938-5390				MAR	2015	38	1					86	91		10.1675/063.038.0111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.038.0111													WOS:000370892800010

The gut contents of the fish were analyzed to reconstruct their rhythmicity of food intake. Fish were found in the pelagic zone only during the night, feeding before midnight with maximal rate. The vertical position of the fish was dependent on the water transparency following a light intensity in the order of 10-3 lux. The diel migration between littoral and pelagic zones was a mainly horizontal one with a vertical component. Both the speed of increase of fish density in the open water and of the vertical movement was correlated to the speed of change of light intensity. Shoals broke up into single fish during the offshore migration. The span of presence in the pelagic zone was identical with the duration of the dark period. During winter no diel migration nor periodical feeding took place.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1980	44	3					368	375											28310293					WOS:A1980JH91600013

The role of management practices in fish kills in recreational lake fisheries in England and Wales	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												In England and Wales, freshwater anglers have shifted their behaviour towards visiting catch-and-release lake fisheries that are intensively stocked, mainly of large common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., to maintain high catch rates. Of 187 fish kills investigated in these intensively stocked lake fisheries in 2004 and 2005, most occurred between April and June and were mainly caused by parasitic or bacterial infections. Bacteria were usually associated with ulcerative diseases caused by strains of the bacterium Aeromonas salmonicida (Emmerich & Weibel) and secondary infections of opportunistic bacteria of the Genus Aeromonas (excluding salmonicida) and Pseudomonas. Parasites involved in fish kills included Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Fouquet), Chilodenella sp., Ichthyobodo necator (Henneguy) and Argulus sp. Outbreaks were typically in fisheries with high extant stock densities (> 1500 kg ha(-1)) and sub-optimal habitats, for example of low habitat heterogeneity with few macrophytes in the littoral zone. Recent stocking was also a key factor when only carp was affected. Thus, certain fisheries management practices that aim to enhance fishery performance may instead trigger fish kills during spring.

J	Hensley, R; Singley, J; Gooseff, M				Hensley, Robert; Singley, Joel; Gooseff, Michael			Pulses within pulses: Concentration-discharge relationships across temporal scales in a snowmelt-dominated Rocky Mountain catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships can provide insight into how catchments store and transport solutes, but analysis is often limited to long-term behaviour assessed from infrequent grab samples. Increasing availability of high-frequency sensor data has shown that C-Q relationships can vary substantially across temporal scales, and in response to different hydrologic drivers. Here, we present 4 years of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) sensor data from a snowmelt- dominated catchment in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We assessed both the direction (enrichment vs. dilution) and hysteresis in C-Q relationships across a range of time scales, from interannual to sub-daily. Both solutes exhibited a seasonal flushing response, with concentrations initially increasing as solute stores are mobilized by the melt pulse, but then declining as these stores are depleted. The high-frequency data revealed that the seasonal melt pulse was composed of numerous individual daily melt pulses. The solute response to daily melt pulses was relatively chemostatic, suggesting mobilization and depletion to be progressive rather than episodic processes. In contrast, rainfall-induced pulses produced short-lived but substantial enrichment responses, suggesting they may activate alternative solute sources or transport pathways. Finally, we observed low-level diel variation during summer baseflow following the melt pulse, likely driven by effects of daily evapotranspiration cycles. Additional contributions from in-stream metabolic cycles, independent from but covarying with diel streamflow cycles, could not be ruled out. The results clearly demonstrate that solute responses to daily cycles and individual events may differ significantly from the longer-term seasonal behaviour they combine to generate.

It has been demonstrated that lake size has pronounced impact on the morphological and chemical properties of the water bodies, and acting through these variables it shapes the distribution of the various algal groups in the water bodies of different sizes. Changes of the relative abundance of the various algal groups along the spatial scale showed four apparently distinct patterns. We found increasing relative abundance of heterocytic cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and those taxa which have no capability of active locomotion and are characterised by high sinking rate in the large water bodies. The flagellated algae (Chlamydomonas spp., euglenophytes, Synura spp.) and the tichoplanktonic elements were characteristic for small-sized water bodies. Most of the chrysophytes and several other flagellated taxa showed hump-shaped distribution along the size scale of water bodies. The group of large colonial flagellated chlorophytes, non-heterocytic filamentous cyanobacteria and filamentous chlorophytes occasionally occurred in high relative abundance both in small and large-sized water bodies. Our findings suggest that water body size has pronounced impact on the composition of algal assemblages.

Upon entering the lake, it caused a large tsunami that traveled about approximate to 3 km across the lake and inundated the shore with vertical runup measuring up to 60-80 m. Following the event, comprehensive field data were collected, including GPS measurements of the inundation and multibeam echo soundings of the lake bathymetry. Using this exhaustive data set, numerical modeling of the tsunami has been conducted using both a nonlinear shallow water model and a Boussinesq-type model that includes frequency dispersion. To constrain unknown landslide parameters, a global optimization algorithm, Differential Evolution, was employed, resulting in a parameter set that minimized the deviation from measured inundation. The tsunami model of Lake Askja is the first example where we have been able to utilize field data to show that frequency dispersion is needed to explain the tsunami wave radiation pattern and that shallow water theory falls short. We were able to fit the trend in tsunami runup observations around the entire lake using the Boussinesq model. In contrast, the shallow water model gave a different runup pattern and produced pronounced offsets in certain areas. The well-documented Lake Askja tsunami thus provided a unique opportunity to explore and capture the essential physics of landslide tsunami generation and propagation through numerical modeling. Moreover, the study of the event is important because this dispersive nature is likely to occur for other subaerial impact tsunamis.

Our aim was to quantify net the greenhouse gases (GHGs) fluxes and examine key factors, which control variation of the GHGs fluxes in the two sites. Net CO2 and CH4 fluxes were markedly different between the two sites; magnitudes and variations of the both fluxes in sandy shore were lower than those of salt marsh. Meanwhile, magnitude and variation of net N2O flux in the two sites were similar. In sandy shore, temporal and spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were highly controlled by water level fluctuation derived from astronomic tide. In salt marsh, spatial variation of the three GHGs fluxes were correlated with aboveground biomass, and temporal variation of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were correlated with soil temperature. The sum of global warming potential, which was roughly estimated using the observed GHGs fluxes, was ca. 174-fold higher in salt marsh than in sandy shore. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Initial experiments with sewage treatment plant influent demonstrated that total Bacteroides spp. could be detected by PCR in a 25- to 125-fold-higher dilution series than E. coli and human-specific Bacteroides spp., which were both found in similar dilution ranges. The limit of detection for the human-specific genetic marker ranged from 0.2 CFU/100 ml to 82 CFU/100 ml culturable E. coli for four wastewater treatment plants in urban and rural areas. The spatial and temporal distributions of these markers were assessed following major rain events that introduced urban storm water, agricultural runoff, and sewage overflows into Lake Michigan. Bacteroides spp. were detected in all of these samples by PCR, including those with < 1 CFU/100 ml E. coli. Human-specific Bacteroides spp. were detected as far as 2 km into Lake Michigan during sewage overflow events, with variable detection 1 to 9 days postoverflow, whereas the cow-specific Bacteroides spp. were detected in only highly contaminated samples near the river outflow. Lake Michigan beaches were also assessed throughout the summer season for the same markers. Bacteroides spp. were detected in all beach samples, including 28 of the 74 samples that did not exceed 235 CFU/100 ml of E. coli. Human-specific Bacteroides spp. were detected at three of the seven beaches; one of the sites demonstrating positive results was sampled during a reported sewage overflow, but E. coli levels were below 235 CFU/100 ml. This study demonstrates the usefulness of non-culture-based microbial-source tracking approaches and the prevalence of these genetic markers in the Great Lakes, including freshwater coastal beaches.

PHOSPHATES IN SEDIMENTS, PROCEEDINGS					4th International Symposium on Phosphates in Sediments	SEP 09-12, 2003	Carmona, SPAIN	Univ Sevilla, Dept Plant Biol & Ecol, Univ Granada, Inst Agua				Common wisdom, supported by field data, suggests that stratifying lakes increase area-based phosphate in the water column during early mixing as a result of increasing phosphate release in hypolimnion during stratification. Since surface water input is usually lower at the end of summer in most lakes, strong effects of external sources on water-column phosphate might be discarded. Internal loading could then be the leading process in P increase during the late stratification-early mixing transition, but this is not always the case. Although areal i-P-diss ratios around I are the rule for many lakes during that period, some depart from that figure. Even the same lake may depict i-P-diss, ratios well above or below unity in different years. We have compiled 163 lake data sets to test if there are trends in P course during early mixing as related to trophic status, surface inflow, summer anoxia and water column depth. Areal i-P-diss, and Tot-P during early mixing are dependent on areal i-P-diss,, and Tot-P in late stratification (R-2 = 0.89-0.95, p < 0.05), thereby suggesting a strong dependence on internal processes. Only lakes with tributaries have statistically higher i-Pdiss ratios than seepage lakes (p = 0.037), but the latter show higher variability No pattern related to either trophic status, hypolimnetic anoxia or water depth has been shown in the areal i-P-diss, ratio. These results indicate that lake-specific processes (for instance, the degree of discharge) are responsible for phosphate dynamics during the late stratification-early mixing transition after its sediment release during stratification. The significance of other variables (e.g. N, Fe, S) for P dynamics at that transition still awaits for confirmation. The main mechanisms of P redistribution in the vertical column during the late stratification-early mixing transition are briefly outlined (pynocline entrainment, diffusive flux, boundary mixing, nitrate inhibition, organismic transport and sedimentation), but they deserve further investigations because they are poorly known at present.																					90-5782-154-0				2005							151	162																WOS:000231779200017

The issue of monitoring planning was quite acute for this landscape-homogeneous area among the Kulunda steppes. Phytoplankton in each of the six lakes was collected in the summer season of 2019 at a total of 54 sampling stations. In total, 139 species of algae and cyanobacteria from seven taxonomic phyla were found in the phytoplankton of the Burabay Park during the study period. Three phyla were the richest in species: diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria. Based on species richness, abundance, and biomass, as well as bioindicators and calculated indices of organic pollution and toxic effects, the current ecological state of the lake was assessed as being under the influence of pollution, of the mesotrophic type and with a high capacity for self-purification. Statistical mapping, calculated by the correlation of the species composition and categories of indicators, revealed the zones of anthropogenic impact located on the shores of the lake, and the water of the lakes as weakly alkaline, quality classes 2-3. An increase in the number of cyanobacteria in coastal communities was revealed, which may be associated with an increase in the biogenic load on the lake ecosystems. The results of the analysis and mapping of indicators revealed that two major factors regulated phytoplankton: salinity and organic pollution. The sources of organic pollution are mostly associated with the intake of substances from the coastal zone, where resorts, roads, and settlements are located.

Size Distribution, Surface Coverage, Water, Carbon, and Metal Storage of Thermokarst Lakes in the Permafrost Zone of the Western Siberia Lowland	WATER												Despite the importance of thermokarst (thaw) lakes of the subarctic zone in regulating greenhouse gas exchange with the atmosphere and the flux of metal pollutants and micro-nutrients to the ocean, the inventory of lake distribution and stock of solutes for the permafrost-affected zone are not available. We quantified the abundance of thermokarst lakes in the continuous, discontinuous, and sporadic permafrost zones of the western Siberian Lowland (WSL) using Landsat-8 scenes collected over the summers of 2013 and 2014. In a territory of 105 million ha, the total number of lakes >0.5 ha is 727,700, with a total surface area of 5.97 million ha, yielding an average lake coverage of 5.69% of the territory. Small lakes (0.5-1.0 ha) constitute about one third of the total number of lakes in the permafrost-bearing zone of WSL, yet their surface area does not exceed 2.9% of the total area of lakes in WSL. The latitudinal pattern of lake number and surface coverage follows the local topography and dominant landscape zones. The role of thermokarst lakes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and most trace element storage in the territory of WSL is non-negligible compared to that of rivers. The annual lake storage across the WSL of DOC, Cd, Pb, Cr, and Al constitutes 16%, 34%, 37%, 57%, and 73%, respectively, of their annual delivery by WSL rivers to the Arctic Ocean from the same territory. However, given that the concentrations of DOC and metals in the smallest lakes (<0.5 ha) are much higher than those in the medium and large lakes, the contribution of small lakes to the overall carbon and metal budget may be comparable to, or greater than, their contribution to the water storage. As such, observations at high spatial resolution (<0.5 ha) are needed to constrain the reservoirs and the mobility of carbon and metals in aquatic systems. To upscale the DOC and metal storage in lakes of the whole subarctic, the remote sensing should be coupled with hydrochemical measurements in aquatic systems of boreal plains.

K.			The solid-state partitioning, distribution, and mineralogical associations of arsenic and antimony: Integrated findings from the Altiplano Puna, South America and international comparisons	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) are potentially hazardous metalloids and their presence in the environment is often related to mineral deposits, mines, and thermal springs. Despite their similar chemical properties, the distribution and behavior of As and Sb in nature has been shown to differ. In order to contribute to a better understanding of As and Sb in the environment as well as the important parameters controlling their mobility, this study presents a synthesis of geochemical results in the Altiplano-Puna of Chile and Bolivian Sb belt. Ana-lyses include (i) solid-state partitioning, (ii) mineralogical studies and (iii) concentrations of both metalloids in groundwater, surface water, porewater, and fluvial and lake sediments in distinct seasons. Consistencies were found between the mobilization patterns of As and Sb in the studied sites where As is generally more mobile than Sb; however, mining-affected areas in the Bolivian Sb belt tend to be associated with a higher proportion of mobile Sb. From a mineralogical standpoint, As is generally associated with iron oxides and hydroxides and As-bearing pyrites, while Sb is linked to iron oxides, hydroxides, and clay-sized phyllosilicates. When compared to different metallogenic settings outside the Altiplano-Puna plateau (the Loa River Basin of northern Chile and Xikuangshan Mine in China), the following conclusions are consistent with the results obtained from the Altiplano-Puna: dissolved Sb concentrations tend to decrease with distance from the respective mining facility, the mobility of Sb is typically lower than As, and the preferred mineralogical associations are iron oxides and hydroxides. Finally, based on the seasonal analysis of As and Sb, it is conceptualized that wetlands behave as a source of As and as a sink and source of Sb depending on the water column; in addition, consideration must be taken regarding aeolian weathering.					; Tapia, Joseline/AAH-4000-2019; Audry, Stéphane/ABF-8717-2020	Audry, Stephane/0000-0002-5075-1262; Murray, Jesica/0000-0002-0636-6228; Ormachea Munoz, Mauricio/0000-0001-8245-1697; Nordstrom, Darrell Kirk/0000-0003-3283-5136; Tapia, Joseline/0000-0002-1516-2622													0895-9811	1873-0647				MAR	2022	114								103713	10.1016/j.jsames.2022.103713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2022.103713		JAN 2022											WOS:000782408400006

Quantifying the impact of urban runoff injection on groundwater enhancement in a semi-arid environment using SWMM and MOFLOW Model	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												In the urban area, surface runoff can be utilized effectively to improve groundwater table through rainwater harvesting. The main aims of this study were to:1) investigate the potential of the surface runoff to inject into Urmia aquifer and increase groundwater recharge of this aquifer using SWMM - MOFLOW Model, 2) to investigate the quality of the urban runoff for aquifer recharge, and 3) to investigate the feasibility and effeteness of the artificial recharge via injection wells in a semi-arid area. Urmia city with an area of 930 Km(2) is located at the West of the Urmia Lake in the North-West of Iran. The study aquifer has a negative groundwater budget, while some of the sub basin in the study watershed is prone to flood in the falling season. In this study, based on the location of surcharged channels, the quantity of rechargeable surface runoff to inject into the aquifer was estimated via SWMM model. Calibrated MODFLOW model was applied to predict the potential effects of the injectable water runoff on the groundwater surface. Estimated runoff by SWMM model was used as the input of the MODFLOW model. The quantity of the heavy metals (Fe2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Pb and Cu2+) TDS and pH were measured to control runoff quality. According to the results, 1.12 million cubic meters (MCM) per year of runoff can be injected to the aquifer via 9 designed injection wells. This amount is equivalent to the annual loss of the aquifer (about 20 centimeters per year) that can ensure the stability of the aquifer in the injection area.

Its natural reproduction hardly occurs as a result of numerous problems related to the use and management of water and bio-resources in the Lake Sevan drainage basin. Masrik River is formerly known as a spawning river for two ecological races of the Sevan trout, but there is no up-to-date and in-depth studies of its potential to support natural reproduction. Thus, a set of spawning criteria was arranged as matrix and state of Masrik River as spawning area for the Sevan trout was assessed. The results showed that the potential of different parts of Masrik River to support natural reproduction of Sevan trout varied from quite appropriate to inappropriate. The main limiting factors revealed were water temperature, velocity and substrate conditions.					; Asatryan, Vardan/AAF-1261-2020; Dallakyan, Marine/B-7572-2015; Dallakyan, Marine/GRJ-9270-2022	Barseghyan, Nelli/0000-0002-2819-093X; Dallakyan, Marine/0000-0001-8269-8227; Asatryan, Vardan/0000-0002-1477-5742; Vardanyan, Tigran/0000-0002-3348-3673													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2020	27	6					6352	6361		10.1007/s11356-019-07151-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07151-1		DEC 2019						31873896					WOS:000504148200015

BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2011	Advances in Limnology				11th International Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	SEP 26-30, 2011	Mondsee, AUSTRIA	Austrian Acad Sci, Austrian Fed Minist Sci & Res, Prov Govt Upper Austria, Community Mondsee				Fish populations inhabiting marginal areas are generally highly susceptible to environmental variation and therefore show large fluctuations in recruitment. The commercially important, and usually freshwater, vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) occupying the brackish waters of the Bothnian Bay forms one such marginal population and shows large annual variation in recruitment. Here, we investigate the relative importance of fishing (trawling time), hydro-climatic factors and species interactions in explaining the variability in vendace recruitment using three sets of models. A comparison of the best models in the hydro-climatic model set and the fishing model revealed that the hydro-climatic variables were overall superior to the anthropogenic model in describing recruitment variability. Trawling time and water temperature in winter combined with salinity explained 33 and 63.7% of the variation in recruitment, respectively. The importance of water temperature and salinity, in combination with the effects of trawling time, calls for catch levels to be set with caution in this vendace fishery.

Event GS-1 is represented in the sediment sequence by 3.5 m of clay containing lacustrine carbonates of various origins. Comparison of isotopic records obtained on mollusc shells, ostracod valves, and Chara encrustations precipitated during specific seasons of the year supports estimates of relative changes in both lake water and mean annual air temperatures. Variations in soil erosion rates can also be estimated from a simple isotope-mass-balance model to separate allochthonous and autochthonous carbonate contributions to the bulk carbonate content of the sediments. The well-known, rapid climatic shifts characterising the Last Termination in the North Atlantic region are clearly reflected in the isotopic data, as well as longer-term changes within GS-1. Following maximum cooling shortly after the Allerod-Younger Dryas (GI-1-GS-1) transition, a progressive warming and a slight increase in aquatic productivity is indicated. At the Younger Dryas-Preboreal (GS-1-PB) transition mean annual air temperature rapidly increased by more than 5 degrees C and summer lake-water temperature increased by ca. 12 degrees C. The subsequent Preboreal oscillation is characterised by an increase in soil erosion and a slight decrease in mean annual air temperature. These results are in harmony with recent findings about large-scale climate dynamics during the Last Termination. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Ridgway, MS				Ridgway, Mark S.			A roadmap for coasters: Landscapes, life histories, and the conservation of brook trout	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												There is still much to do in developing informed policy on the issue of migratory ("coaster") brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis. My purpose in this paper is to provide a summary of research from other programs that may be useful for understanding the dichotomy between coaster and stream-resident brook trout. Great Lakes glacial history, population structure at the watershed level, landscape-scale habitat patterns, the energetics of resident and migratory brook trout, and dichotomous movements of young of year all provide important context for coaster brook trout. I apply a new growth model to literature sources on brook trout life history to scope the potential range of coaster-resident life histories. The results indicate that juvenile growth falls largely into two groups, depending on whether the adult prey field incorporates fish in the diet. Combining ideas on variation in the standard metabolic rate and habitat productivity with a new theory of food web structure from other authors leads to an interesting working hypothesis for coaster brook trout that builds on W. E. Ricker's original observations on brook trout diet over 75 years ago.																			0002-8487					JUL	2008	137	4					1179	1191		10.1577/T05-268.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-268.1													WOS:000258163500021

The predominant ions were Ca2+ and SO42-. For soil solutions collected by lysimeters, the highest concentrations of most ions (H+, K+, NH4+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and NO3-) occurred in O horizon leachates, and the lowest concentrations beneath the spodic B horizon. However, Al and SO42- concentrations were highest beneath the B horizon. Concentrations of NO3- showed distinct seasonal variation. Values reached 60 .mu.equiv. L-1 in the spring and decreased to near zero late in the growing season. Coefficients of variation (CV) differed among horizons. The E horizon was generally most variable (CV, 17 to 199%) and the B horizon the least (CV 19 to 166%). Variation was especially high for NO3- and NH4+, which had minimum CVs of 124% and 122%, respectively. Variation in these ions was likely due to the dominant role of biological processes in affecting nitrogen dynamics. Differences in soil solution concentrations among six soil pits were mainly due to spatial variation in soil properties rather than differences among the four types of lysimeters (tension, zero tension, fritted glass, and ceramic plate). Nitrogen species showed the greatest response to the installation of lysimeters, with elevated concentrations of NO3- (120 to 160 .epsilon.quiv. L-1) observed during the first 2 years after installation. The high temporal and spatial variation of NO3- as well as its generation following lysimeter installation has important implications in assessing nitrogen dynamics of forest ecosystems.

We integrated detailed results from a natural experiment comprising an average-wet year (2011) and one with heat waves (2012), a long-term meteorological dataset (1960-2010). historical phosphorus concentrations and sedimentary pigment records, to determine the mechanistic controls of cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic polymictic lake. Intense warming in 2012 was associated with: 1) increased stability of the water column with buoyancy frequencies exceeding 40 cph at the surface, 2) high phytoplankton biomass in spring (up to 125 mg WWL-1), 3) reduced downward transport of heat and 4) depleted epilimnetic CO2 concentrations. CO2 depletion was maintained by intense uptake by phytoplankton (influx up to 30 mmol m(-2 )d(-1)) in combination with reduced, internal and external, carbon inputs during dry, stratified periods. These synergistic effects triggered bloom of buoyant cyanobacteria (up to 300 mg WWL-1) in the hot year. Complementary evidence from polynomial regression modelling using historical data and pigment record revealed that warming explains 78% of the observed trends in cyanobacterial biomass, whereas historical phosphorus concentration only 10% thereof. Together the results from the natural experiment and the long-term record indicate that effects of hotter and drier climate are likely to increase water column stratification and decrease CO2 availability in eutrophic polymictic lakes. This combination will catalyze blooms of buoyant cyanobacteria. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The findings confirmed calibration and indicated that the most sensitive physicochemical and biochemical processes were chemical weathering, ion exchange, sufate reduction by lake sediments, and sulfate adsorption by the terrestrial compartments. Long-term simulations showed that both lakes will reach steady state after a change in loading in fewer than 10 years. It was determined that 25 to 50% of the exchangeable bases in the upper soil will be depleted in the next 50 years without chemical weathering to resupply the base exchange complex. The sulfate sorption mechanism is the only one that could delay watershed response after a change in loading. Some alkalinity in one lake could be recovered if acid deposition was decreased by a factor of two. The other would remain alkaline even with twice as much acid deposition; however, in spring snowmelt events, lakes would become more acidic.

(2) The diurnal variation of sound sources is opposite to that of temperature, 6:00-9:00 is the best time for the public to perceive birdsong, and after 18:00, the park is dominated by insect chirps. (3) The PSD (power spectral density) and the SDI (soundscape diversity index) of the park are greatly affected by public recreation behaviors, and some recreation behaviors may affect the vocal behavior of organisms such as birds. (4) Spaces with high canopy density can attract more birdsong and recreational sounds in summer, and the combination of "tree + lake" can attract more birdsong. Vegetation has a significant dampening effect on traffic sound. (5) Landscape spatial elements, such as the proportion of hard ground, sky, trees, and shrubs, have a significant impact on changes in the PSD, the SDI and different kinds of sound sources. The research results provide effective data support for improving the soundscape of urban forests.					; yan, Chen/JGE-2971-2023; Chen, ZiRu/AAL-7211-2020	zheng, du lai/0000-0003-2998-945X; Dong, Jiaying/0000-0001-5270-5852; 														1999-4907				NOV	2022	13	11							1751	10.3390/f13111751	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13111751													WOS:000881123600001

However, the hydrological evolution of the QLM during the last millennium remains controversial, and their ecological response to climate change is poorly understood. We present a pH record based on the brGDGTs (branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) of a 14C-dated sediment core from Lake Maozangtianchi in the QLM. We combined this record with element contents determined by scanning XRF and grain size to reconstruct the summer monsoon precipitation variability over the last 900 years. We also reconstructed the history of eco-environmental changes from the total n-alkane contents. On centennial scales, local precipitation exhibited peaks during the intervals of 1100-1300 CE and 1750-2000 CE, as well as between 1400-1750 CE. Additionally, abrupt decreases in precipitation occurred during the transition from the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1300-1400 CE). This pattern coherent with other hydroclimatic records from the monsoonal margin of northern China, likely resulted from the combined impact of the El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation on tropical Pacific sea-surface temperatures and the meridional shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, a coupled relationship between plant biomass in the Lake Maozangtianchi watershed and fluctuations in monsoon precipitation was observed, with higher plant biomass during 1100-1200 CE, 1750-1900 CE, and 1950-2000 CE, and lower biomass during 1200-1400 CE and 1900-1950 CE. However, during 1400-1750 CE, plant biomass exhibited a minor increasing trend, deviating from its usual correlation with monsoon precipitation. Despite precipitation usually being the primary climatic factor influencing plant biomass in the QLM, during the LIA, nutrients transported by dust and decreased evapotranspiration became pivotal in bolstering plant growth. Our research emphasizes the significant moderating effects of exogenic dust on vegetation changes in alpine ecosystems.					; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Wang, Tao/ITT-5767-2023; WANG, TIANXIAO/ISV-3758-2023	Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; Youmo, Li/0009-0007-5546-3757; Lin, Chen/0000-0001-6325-6677; 													0309-1333	1477-0296				AUG	2024	48	4					493	517		10.1177/03091333241252401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03091333241252401		MAY 2024											WOS:001216533100001

Viability, dormancy, germination, and intraspecific variation of Bolboschoenus maritimus (alkali bulrush) seeds	AQUATIC BOTANY												Bolboschoenus maritimus (alkali bulrush) is a globally distributed, clonal wetland plant. In the Great Salt Lake (GSL) Basin, USA, the focal region for this study, this species forms large, monotypic stands that provide critical wetland habitat for millions of migratory birds. I conducted a series of seed trait studies with B. maritimus seeds sourced from five GSL Basin populations. Seed viability was high (87-98%) and varied little among the five source populations. Chemical scarification with 3% bleach for 24 or 48 h broke dormancy in seeds from all five source populations; there was substantial intraspecific variation (up to two-fold differences in germination) in response to scarification. The conditions suitable for germination included high light, summer temperatures (32/15 degrees C or 35/18 degrees C), and flooding. Results of this study suggest conditions under which recruitment from seed may play a role in B. maritimus patch dynamics. Furthermore, study results can be used to improve restoration of this important habitat species through the development of more effective seed revegetation following invasive Phragmites australis removal in GSL wetlands.

Sediments of this proglacial lake cover the past 9400 years and hence represent almost the whole Holocene history. The biosiliceous muddy sample material was analysed for several geochemical and biological parameters, such as the total organic carbon and biogenic silica content, and the diatom community (quantitative and qualitative changes). Based on changes in the relative abundances of the most frequent species Aulacoseira subarctica, Staurosira martyi and Stephanodiscus alpinus and a depth-constrained cluster analyses (CONISS), five diatom assemblage zones could be identified. The oldest stage recovered lies between 9400 and 9000 cal. a BP and reflects the initial lake stage after the retreat of local glaciers, with a high detrital sediment supply, shallow-water conditions and a high diatom diversity. The next zone (9000-6200 cal. a BP) shows a more mature lake system with accumulating biogenic remains and higher water levels during climate amelioration. This is followed by the most obvious change in the diatom assemblage, delineated by an occurrence of S.alpinus, between 6200 and 2700 cal. a BP. Wet conditions in spring probably led to an enhanced fluvial runoff and eutrophic to hypertrophic conditions. The end of this period might reflect climate deterioration related to the Neoglacial epoch of the Holocene. Between 2700 and 1600 cal. a BP the sediments of Lake Sokoch reveal oligotrophic water conditions in a windy high-energy environment. The youngest interval, between 1600 cal. a BP and the Present, indicates shallow-water conditions and a very short growing season, which might reflect the Little Ice Age. The results may offer a baseline for the interpretation of Holocene palaeoenvironmental changes in Kamchatka and their relation to regional climate change from a palaeoecological perspective.					; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Dirksen, Veronika/A-5322-2018	Diekmann, Bernhard/0000-0001-5129-3649; Kuhn, Gerhard/0000-0001-6069-7485; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				JAN	2014	43	1					22	41		10.1111/bor.12019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12019													WOS:000328619600002

The average concentration of chlorophyll a and phaeopigments (Chl + Ph) in total reaches up to 3.9 mu g/g dry matter in rivers, 5.6 in ponds, 13.8 in sand quarries, 56.8 in reservoirs, and 245 in lakes. Most frequently, the concentrations of Chl + Ph in the coastal zones of watercourses and water bodies fall in the oligotrophic category, and those in the central areas are in the hypertrophic category. Relationships between concentrations of Chl + Ph and water depth, content of oxygen near the bottom, moisture content, volumetric mass, and concentrations of organic matter (OM) in the BSs are found. The content of sedimentary pigments in tropical waters of Vietnam is similar to that in freshwater ecosystems of temperate latitudes, despite the substantial differences of climatic zones in temperature and light regimes.

Recovery of a Wild Fish Population from Whole-Lake Additions of a Synthetic Estrogen	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Despite widespread recognition that municipal wastewaters contain natural and synthetic estrogens, which interfere with development and reproduction of fishes in freshwaters worldwide, there are limited data on the extent to which natural populations of fish can recover from exposure to these compounds. We conducted whole-lake additions of an active component of the birth control pill (17 alpha-ethynylestradiol; EE2) that resulted in the collapse of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) population. Here we quantify physiological, population, and genetic characteristics of this population over the 7 years after EE2 additions stopped to determine if complete recovery was possible. By 3 years post-treatment, whole-body vitellogenin concentrations in male fathead minnow had returned to baseline, and testicular abnormalities were absent. In the spring of the fourth year, adult size-frequency distribution and abundance had returned to pretreatment levels. Microsatellite analyses clearly showed that postrecovery fish were descendants of the original EE2-treated population. Results from this whole-lake experiment demonstrate that fish can recover from EE2 exposure at the biochemical through population levels, although the timelines to do so are long for multigenerational exposures. These results suggest that wastewater treatment facilities that reduce discharges of estrogens and their mimics can improve the health of resident fish populations in their receiving environments.					; Palace, Vince/AHB-6708-2022; Kidd, Karen A/ABG-3237-2020; Docker, Margaret/HTS-1902-2023; Kidd, Karen/ABG-3237-2020	Blanchfield, Paul/0000-0003-0886-5642; Kidd, Karen A/0000-0002-5619-1358; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 3	2015	49	5					3136	3144		10.1021/es5060513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es5060513								25658019					WOS:000350611100069
J	Guyette, RP; Cole, WG				Guyette, RP; Cole, WG			Age characteristics of coarse woody debris (Pinus strobus) in a lake littoral zone	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Littoral coarse woody debris (CWD) is a persistent class of aquatic habitat that accumulates over many centuries and provides habitat for diverse floral and faunal communities. We used dendrochronological methods to analyze residence times and age-related characteristics of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) CWD in the littoral zone of Swan Lake in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario. The mean calendar date of all the annual rings in CWD samples was 1551. Annual rings dated from calendar year 1893 to 982. The mean time from carbon assimilation in a live tree to carbon loss from littoral woody debris was 443 years. Outside ring dates of the woody debris were significantly correlated with the bole's maximum and minimum diameter ratio, mass, specific gravity, length, and submergence. Negative exponential functions described the temporal structure of the CWD mass and abundance. Accelerated inputs of woody debris resulted from late nineteenth century logging and a disturbance circa 1500. No mature eastern white pine have fallen into the lake over the last 100 years.																			0706-652X					MAR	1999	56	3					496	505		10.1139/cjfas-56-3-496	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-3-496													WOS:000081027800015
J	Harman, WN				Harman, WN			Otsego Lake macrobenthos communities between 1968 and 1993: Indicators of decreasing water quality	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Otsego Lake is a dimictic lake that fills a depression formed by the overdeepening of the headwaters of the Susquehanna River in New York. During summer stratification, the hypolimnetic waters become oxygen depleted, which has potential impacts on the cold-water fishery and has caused changes in the distribution of profundal macroinvertebrates. Trends in water quality parameters attest to the stresses of eutrophication, and artificial alterations in water levels have negatively impacted eulittoral macrobenthos. Eulittoral species richness has decreased 27.7% from 1968-88 to 1989-93. Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera species richness has decreased 56.1%. Mollusca richness 52.9%. Invertebrate biomass at all depths remained stable between 1935 and 1969, but has increased since then. In 1968 mollusks dominated the eulittoral environment, arthropods were preponderant at 4-30 m in depth, and oligochaetes claimed the deepest waters. The entire littoral benthic community is now dominated by mollusks, and oligochaetes occupy substrates at middle profundal depths at the expense of the fingernail clams and the Chironomidae.																			0270-5060					SEP	1997	12	3					465	476		10.1080/02705060.1997.9663557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1997.9663557													WOS:A1997XT95900014

Lake Baikal is affected by a number of environmental stressors, including coastal eutrophication. Daily measurements of concentrations of nutrients, dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), weekly measurements of algae abundance and biomass in the open water season in June-December 2020, and measurements of concentrations of nutrients at 2-7-day intervals in June-October 2021 were made in the littoral of the South Baikal for the first time. It was shown that nitrate and phosphate concentrations decreased by July-August, their minimum content was maintained until September, concentrations began to increase in October and reached a maximum in December. The maximum abundance and biomass of algae and chlorophyll concentrations were only observed in early July. Storm situations increased the content of nitrogen, phosphorus and DO in water, the duration of their influence was not more than 2 days. A correlation matrix revealed significant positive correlations of NO3--DO, phosphate (SPR)-NO3-, SRP-DO and biomass-Chl-a and strong negative correlations between water temperature (Tw)-DO, Tw-NO3-, Tw-total nitrogen (TN) and Tw-SRP. Based on SRP and NO3- concentrations and TN:TP ratios, it was concluded that algal development was limited to nitrogen and phosphorus in summer. The trophic status of the Southern Baikal littoral zone was assessed using classifications based on TN, TP, NO3-, SRP, Chl-a content and algal biomass, as well as the Carlson index (TSI) and probabilistic assessment. The results of assessments using different methods of trophic status determination showed that the Baikal littoral zone in the study area belongs to the oligotrophic type with minor elements of mesotrophy. According to the saprobity index, water purity of littoral waters varies within the oligosaprobic and beta-mesosaprobic zones and corresponded to quality classes II and III (clean and moderate purity); the system demonstrates a high capacity for self-purification.

Grout Curtain Installation for Sump Excavation in Permafrost Region of Northern Canada	GROUTING 2017: CASE HISTORIES	Geotechnical Special Publication				5th International Conference on Grouting, Deep Mixing, and Diaphragm Walls	JUL 09-12, 2017	Honolulu, HI	Int Conf Org Grouting, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers Grouting Tech Comm, Geo Inst				As part of an expansion of a tailings facility infrastructure located in northern Canada, a grout curtain was installed at the location selected for a future sump expansion to reduce any potential inflow of water from a lake located immediately adjacent to the sump. Curtain installation included treatment of both the overburden and upper and lower fractured bedrock, and interface treatment carried out through use of sleeve port pipe technology. Challenging ground conditions that included poor quality, frost shattered bedrock required that a combined solution of consolidation grouting and downstage techniques be applied to reach the target curtain depth. An additional challenge was the need for rapid grout thickening and volume limit protocols combined with continuous environmental monitoring while injecting in close proximity to the lake. This paper summarizes the grouting program, challenges and solutions, and successful implementation of environmental monitoring techniques. The site is located in an isolated area of northern Canada and is accessed either by aircraft or by winter ice road.																			0895-0563		978-0-7844-8078-6				2017		287					106	115																WOS:000406687900010

Adult animals were exposed to different treatments under continuous or dynamic conditions (temperature and photoperiod) to test whether the simulation of field conditions, with changing temperature and photoperiod, induces differences in their reproductive traits in comparison to continuous conditions, with the aim of extrapolating results to the lake. Continuous conditions were the photoperiod and temperature values recorded in the lake at the time when ephippial reproduction is induced. Dynamic conditions were the changing values in the field from the continuous conditions until autumn. The number of healthy ephippial eggs per ephippium was also recorded by using sediment traps in the lake. Our results show that subitaneous and ephippial egg abortion has a major influence on an obligate parthenogenetic Daphnia population in both the laboratory and field. The total number of healthy ephippial eggs per ephippium (mean +/- SE; 0.52 +/- 0.12) and the proportion of released empty ephippia obtained in the sediment traps (0.73 +/- 0.05) were similar to those experimentally obtained under dynamic conditions (healthy eggs per ephippium: 0.29 +/- 0.16; proportion of released empty ephippia: 0.79 +/- 0.11), suggesting that ephippial egg abortion and empty ephippia production are frequent in nature. This is the first study to describe Daphnia ephippial egg abortion and compare subitaneous and ephippial egg abortion between experimental and field conditions. This approach is recommended for future research into Daphnia or cladoceran reproduction.

Four stages of algal succession were identified. The successional pattern was, in general, similar from year to year. External disturbances such as increased wind mixing and high floods had the effect of setting the succession back to an earlier stage. Nanoplanktic diatoms and flagellates dominated during the first stages of succession. The succession was running from r-selected species in early stages to K-strategists in summer and towards a mixed community in the terminal stage. Diversity was expressed by the indices of Gleason and Shannon (based on physical units and biomass). Interpretation of species diversity took into account the differential variations of its two components, the number of species and the evenness of their distribution. Diversity was more affected by evenness than by number of species. Diversity increased in late stages of succession corresponding to the complexity of the community (high number of species, high evenness). Physical disturbances influenced positively the diversity. The maximal diversity appeared in the transition periods between the compositional changes generated by disturbances and the true successional development. Disturbances may generate a more uniform distribution of diversity throughout the whole water column. The role of physical disturbances in increasing the phytoplankton diversity may be demonstrated from comparisons of diversity - evenness - species number of the same stages under different meteorological conditions.

In this study, wetland thermal mediation is evaluated using a linearized dead-zone model. Its impact on lake inflow dynamics is then assessed by applying the model sequentially to the river reach, wetland, and lake. Our results suggest that littoral wetlands can dramatically alter the inflow dynamics of reservoirs located in small or forested watersheds, for example, by raising the temperature of the inflow during the summer and creating surface intrusions when a plunging inflow would otherwise exist. Consequently, river-borne nutrients, contaminants, and pathogens enter directly into the epilimnion, where they enhance eutrophication and the risk of human exposure. The addition of a littoral wetland has less significant effects in larger watersheds, where the water has already equilibrated with the atmosphere upon reaching the wetland and sun shading is less prominent.					; Andradottir, Hrund/M-2013-2015	Andradottir, Hrund/0000-0002-4832-1503; Nepf, Heidi/0000-0002-3663-9071; 													0043-1397					MAR	2000	36	3					725	735		10.1029/1999WR900306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1999WR900306													WOS:000085519700008

It is economically most important fish species in Finnish commercial inland fisheries. Moreover, it is of great importance also for recreational lake fisheries. Fishing of vendace has a rich history stretching back over several centuries in Finland. During the past 10-15 years, Finnish vendace fisheries fishing techniques as well as catches and markets have been faced with significant changes. In addition to the strong fluctuations of vendace stocks and catches, new fishing techniques have partly replaced the traditional fishing gear and methods. Especially, the efficiency of fishing through motorization has increased, so the need for manpower has decreased. For example, commercial beach seining has almost totally been replaced by trawling in open water vendace fishery. Additionally motorized equipment is now widely used instead of manpower in under-ice winter seining. Significant changes in vendace fishery and fish stocks have resulted in conflicts between fisher groups.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						419	427																WOS:000078180200042

However, a lack of highresolution and temporally well-constrained continental records hinders our understanding of the driving mechanisms of climate change during this period. In this study, we combined magnetostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy to establish a high-resolution astronomical time scale spanning the middle to late Eocene (-42.4 Ma to -35.3 Ma) through a 214-m succession of the continental Honghe Formation in the Weihe Basin, North China. Our results show that variability in the hydroclimate of the Weihe Basin at this time was dominated by eccentricity (-405 kyr and -100 kyr) and obliquity (-1.15 Myr and -173 kyr) forcing. Meridional insolation gradient variations controlled by obliquity, and low-latitude summer insolation via eccentricity modulation of precession jointly controlled paleolake evolution in the basin during the -42.4 Ma to -35.3 Ma interval, rather than being controlled by eccentricity or obliquity as previously inferred. Our study provides new insights into the driving mechanisms of orbital-scale hydroclimate evolution in continental lake basins during the ice-free middle to late Eocene.

Here, we analyzed the spatial distribution of small TLs along the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor (QTEC) based on high-resolution (up to 2.0 m) satellite images. The TLs gathered in the plains and upland plateau and covered 8.3% of the QTEC land. We deployed a random-frost method to investigate the suitable environmental conditions for TLs. Climate including summer rainfall and the air temperature was the most important factor controlling the TL distribution, followed by topography and soil characteristics that affected the ground ice content. TL susceptibility was mapped based on the combinations of climate, soil, and topography grid data. On average, around 20% of the QTEC area was in a high to very-high-susceptibility zone that is likely to develop TLs in response to climate change. This study improved the understanding of controlling factors for TL development but also provided insights into the conditions of massive ground ice and was helpful to assess the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes and engineering design.					; luo, jing/JEP-0699-2023	yin, guoan/0000-0002-8855-8388; 														2072-4292				MAY	2021	13	10							1974	10.3390/rs13101974	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13101974													WOS:000662492100001

NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Fecundity of fish is influenced by several factors, including body length, condition, population density, and environmental conditions. It follows that fecundity of fish populations can exhibit spatiotemporal variability; thus, periodic quantification of length-fecundity relationships is important for management. We hypothesized that average fecundity of CiscoCoregonus artediin the upper Laurentian Great Lakes would be lower in Lake Superior than in Lakes Huron and Michigan. The trophic status of these lakes recently converged, but Lakes Huron and Michigan currently support lower Cisco densities; thus, we expected that they would reach larger sizes and have greater fecundity owing to lower intraspecific competition. Ovaries were collected from prespawn Cisco during 2008-2010 to test this hypothesis. We also compared length-fecundity relationships for 2008-2010 to those of precollapse (1930s-1950s) populations to explore how relationships have changed. Average fecundity of Cisco during 2008-2010 was lower in Lake Superior compared to Lakes Huron and Michigan; length-fecundity relationships in the latter two lakes did not vary significantly, so they were combined. Body condition was highest in Lakes Huron and Michigan. We used otoliths to determine age and found that body condition was domed shaped with respect to age in Lakes Huron and Superior. There were no females older than age 5 in our samples from Lake Michigan because that population was just beginning to recover from very low levels. Females of intermediate age had the highest fecundities in both Lake Huron (ages 7-13) and Lake Superior (ages 8-18). We hypothesize that differences in body morphometry may also influence fecundity, with deeper-bodiedC. artedi albus, the predominant form in Lakes Michigan and Huron, having greater fecundity than shallower-bodiedC. artedi artediin Lake Superior. Moreover, varying Cisco diets and seasonal movement patterns across lakes may have also contributed to differences. Females in Lakes Superior and Michigan are currently more fecund than their precollapse counterparts.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2020	40	4					973	985		10.1002/nafm.10457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10457		JUL 2020											WOS:000548381400001

Cochliopodium arabianum n. sp., previously labeled as "isolate Con1" in prior publications, has been shown to group within the genus Cochliopodium in our molecular phylogenetic analysis.

Cochliopodium arabianum n. sp. is typically round when stationary; or oval to sometimes broadly flabellate or triangular in shape during locomotion, with average length of 35 mu m and breadth of 51 mu m. Fine structure evidence indicates C. arabianum n. sp. has tower-like scales, lacking a terminal spine, sharing high similarity with its closest relative C. actinophorum. However, the scales of C. arabianum n. sp. are unique in height and the breadth of the base plate.

J	LISTON, GE; HALL, DK				LISTON, GE; HALL, DK			AN ENERGY-BALANCE MODEL OF LAKE-ICE EVOLUTION	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												A physically based mathematical model of the coupled lake, lake ice, snow and atmosphere system is developed for studying terrestrial-atmospheric interactions in high-elevation and high-latitude regions. The ability to model lake-ice freeze-up, break-up, total ice thickness and ice type offers the potential to describe the effects of climate change in these regions. Model output is validated against lake-ice observations made during the winter of 1992-93 in Glacier National Park, Montana, U.S.A. The model is driven with observed daily atmospheric forcing of precipitation, wind speed and air temperature. In addition to simulating complete energy-balance components over the annual cycle, model output includes ice freeze-up and break-up dates, and the end-of-season clear ice, snow-ice and total ice depths for two nearby lakes in Glacier National Park, each in a different topographic setting. Modeled ice features are found to agree closely with the lake-ice observations. Model simulations illustrate the key role that the wind component of the local climatic regime plays on the growth and decay of lake ice. The wind speed affects both the surface temperature and the accumulation of snow on the lake-ice surface. Higher snow accumulations on the lake ice depress the ice surface below the water line, causing the snow to become saturated and leading to the formation of snow-ice deposits. In regions having higher wind speeds, significantly less snow accumulates on the lake-ice surface, thus limiting snow-ice formation. The ice produced hy these two different mechanisms has distinctly different optical and radiative properties, and affects the monitoring of frozen lakes using remote-sensing techniques.

These were obtained from two autumn surveys using fine-scale CTD casts in the sewage near-field around the diffusers which lie on a flat seabed in a shallow sea. Indications that a turbulent effluent could manifest itself with a local maximum of the overturning length scale are discussed. The depth of the subsurface local peak of the overturning length scale, calculated from the density profile in the core of the sewage near-field, matches the position of the peak of the vertical distribution of faecal coliforms and the height of the simulated plume rise. The 3D space distribution of the overturning length scale indicates a structure with enhanced overturning activity below the surface mixed layer over an area of 1 km(2) which could be attributed to an effluent that erupts turbulently from diffusers.

However, it is still unclear how geochemical proxies based on GDGTs, particularly in lake surface sediments, respond to seasonal environmental changes in shallow water lakes, whose sediment cores are increasingly being used for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. In this study, we collected samples from the top 0-2 cm of sediments and water column suspended particulate matter (SPM) at a monthly interval from June 2015 to May 2016 in Lake Donghu, a shallow lake in central China. An updated liquid chromatography method was used to separate the 5- and 6-methyl brGDGTs. A remarkable difference between the lake sediments, SPM, and catchment soils suggested that microorganisms inhabiting the surface sediments contributed a significant proportion of isoGDGTs and brGDGTs to the GDGT pool in the lake sediments. We found a clear seasonality in the concentration and distribution of core lipid (CL) isoGDGTs and brGDGTs in the lake surface sediments, in contrast to the absence of seasonality in brGDGTs in mid-latitude soils reported by previous studies. The intact polar lipid/CL ratios for both isoGDGTs and brGDGTs in the lake surface sediments were significantly higher than those in SPM and catchment soils and were higher in the warm seasons than in winter. This collectively suggested that the turnover of brGDGTs in the lake sediments was faster than that in soils. Furthermore, the GDGT-0/ Cren ratio for the lake sediments exhibited a negative correlation with dissolved oxygen in the water column. The cyclisation degree of C5-methylated brGDGTs (CBT5ME) was strongly related to water pH. Seasonal temperature variation clearly impacted the methylation degree of C6-methylated brGDGTs (MBT'(6ME)) but had no influence on C5-methylated brGDGTs (MBT'(5mE)), as opposed to the dependence of MBT'(5ME) on temperature in global soils, peatlands and African lakes. Due to the fast turnover rate and the sensitive response to seasonality, we suggest that the seasonal variation of fossil GDGTs in lake sediments should be considered when developing a calibration using fossil GDGTs in shallow-water lake surface sediments.

The study included a real-time field work performed during the overpass of Landsat-5 satellite on 21/08/2011 over Salt Lake, Turkey. Normalized vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation condition index (VCI), and temperature vegetation index (TVX) were used for evaluating drought impact over the region between 1984 and 2011. In the image processing step, geometric and radiometric correction procedures were conducted to make satellite remote sensing data comparable with in situ measurements carried out using thermal infrared thermometer supported by hand-held GPS. The results showed that real-time ground and satellite remote sensing data were in good agreement with correlation coefficient (R-2) values of 0.90. The remotely sensed and treated satellite images and resulting thematic indices maps showed that dramatic land surface temperature changes occurred (about 2 degrees C) in the Salt Lake Basin area during the 28-year period (1984-2011). Analysis of air temperature data also showed increases at a rate of 1.5-2 degrees C during the same period. Intensification of irrigated agriculture particularly in the southern basin was also detected. The use of water supplies, especially groundwater, should be controlled considering particularly summer drought impacts on the basin.					; Dadaser-Celik, Filiz/AAE-2824-2019; orhan, osman/W-6764-2019	Ekercin, Semih/0000-0002-9458-2261; Dadaser-Celik, Filiz/0000-0003-3623-7723; orhan, osman/0000-0002-1362-8206													1537-744X						2014									142939	10.1155/2014/142939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/142939								24587709					WOS:000330662500001
J	Fox, JA				Fox, Jennifer Ann			Hatching timing of Daphnia mendotae diapausing eggs of different ages	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Many annual-plant and invertebrate species produce seeds or eggs that can survive in dormancy for many years before germinating or hatching. The ability of the resulting seed or egg banks to influence population dynamics is a function of the success and duration of germination or hatching and subsequent development. To explore this for Daphnia mendotae, I collected diapausing eggs from the sediments of Onondaga Lake, NY, incubated them in spring photoperiod and temperature conditions, and measured the duration of different life stages for eggs from recent (< 5 year-old) and older (15-20 year-old) sediments. A total of 432 D. mendotae hatched. Many of these hatchlings were inviable (39-44 %), with a higher proportion of late hatchers from both egg ages showing inviability. The days to hatch for two eggs from a single ephippium (egg case) is highly positively correlated, indicating either a genetic or maternal component to survival. Older eggs take, on average, 8.6 days longer to hatch than recent eggs. When the total time to maturity is considered for the subset of animals surviving to reproduce, there is no significant difference between older and younger diapausing eggs in the time from when an egg first receives the hatching stimulus to the release of the hatchling's first brood. These results suggest that for those eggs receiving a hatching cue, neither egg age nor hatching timing alone is a good predictor of the potential impact of the egg bank on population dynamics, but both must be considered.																			1863-9135						2007	168	1					19	26		10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0019													WOS:000245666500003

Preliminary insights on the fine-scale responses in larval Gilchristella aestuaria (Family Clupeidae) and dominant zooplankton to estuarine harmful algal blooms	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Estuarine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by eutrophication. In a warm-temperate South African estuary, modified hydrodynamics and agricultural return flows drive eutrophication which has resulted in recurrent harmful algal blooms (HABs). These bloom conditions provided an opportunity to investigate the fine-scale temporal responses of the most dominant larval fish (Clupeidae: Gilchristella aestuaria) and zooplankton (Copepoda: Pseudodiaptomus hessei, Paracartia longipatella; Mysida: Mesopodopsis wooldridgei, Rhopalophthalmus terranatalis) species to HABs (Raphidophyceae: Heterosigma akashiwo). Data were collected within the mesohaline zone during spring and analysed according to HAB phases (`bloom', 'decay', 'intermediate'). During blooms, low densities of predominantly postflexion G. aestuaria and high prey (P. hessei) and predator (R. terranatalis) densities were recorded. The density of G. aestuaria was higher during the 'decay' phase and consisted mainly of preflexion and newly hatched individuals. Gilchristella aestuaria dynamics were best explained by temperature, R. terranatalis density, supersaturated dissolved oxygen and bloom biomass. The HAB also resulted in a mismatch between larval G. aestuaria and its main prey, P. hessei. Recurrent HABs threaten estuarine ecosystem function by driving the loss of forage fish. This study provided insight into the fine-scale consequences that HABs have on plankton dynamics and is relevant in a future of global change where eutrophication will intensify.

Continuous and Synoptic Assessment of Indian Inland Waters for Harmful Algae Blooms	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (CyanoHABs) are progressively becoming a major water quality, socioeconomic, and health hazard worldwide. In India, there are frequent episodes of severe CyanoHABs, which are left untreated due to a lack of awareness and monitoring infrastructure, affecting the economy of the country gravely. In this study, for the first time, we present a country-wide analysis of CyanoHABs in India by developing a novel interactive cloud-based dashboard called "CyanoKhoj" in Google Earth Engine (GEE) which uses Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) remotely sensed datasets. The main goal of this study was to showcase the utility of CyanoKhoj for rapid monitoring and discuss the widespread CyanoHABs problems across India. We demonstrate the utility of Cyanokhoj by including select case studies of lakes and reservoirs geographically spread across five states: Bargi and Gandhisagar Dams in Madhya Pradesh, Hirakud Reservoir in Odisha, Ukai Dam in Gujarat, Linganamakki Reservoir in Karnataka, and Pulicat Lake in Tamil Nadu. These sites were studied from September to November 2018 using CyanoKhoj, which is capable of near-real-time monitoring and country-wide assessment of CyanoHABs. We used CyanoKhoj to prepare spatiotemporal maps of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content and Cyanobacterial Cell Density (CCD) to study the local spread of the CyanoHABs and their phenology in these waterbodies. A first-ever all-India CCD map is also presented for the year 2018, which highlights the spatial spread of CyanoHABs throughout the country (32 large waterbodies across India with severe bloom: CCD>2,500,000). Results indicate that CyanoHABs are most prevalent in nutrient-rich waterbodies prone to industrial and other nutrient-rich discharges. A clear temporal evolution of the blooms showed that they are dominant during the post-monsoon season (September-October) when the nutrient concentrations in the waterbodies are at their peak, and they begin to decline towards winter (NovemberDecember). CyanoKhoj is an open-source tool that can have a significant broader impact in mapping CyanoHABs not only throughout cyanobacteria data-scarce India, but on a global level using archived and future Sentinel3A/B OLCI data.					; Mishra, Deepak/Q-1250-2018; Kumar, Abhishek/I-4691-2019; Maniyar, Chintan/ACQ-4295-2022	Maniyar, Chintan/0000-0001-8513-7871; Kumar, Abhishek/0000-0002-0956-1766; Mishra, Deepak/0000-0001-8192-7681; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				JAN	2022	111								102160	10.1016/j.hal.2021.102160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2021.102160								35016766					WOS:000754475900010

Prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) diversity, abundances (including virus-like particles) and metabolic profiles were investigated by an integrated approach, including traditional and new-generation methods. Although similar diversity indices were computed for both Bacteria and Archaea, distinct bacterial and archaeal assemblages were observed. Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria were more abundant in the shallowest brine pocket, TF4, and Deltaproteobacteria, mainly represented by versatile sulphate-reducing bacteria, dominated in the deepest, TF5. The detection of sulphate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic Archaea likely reflects the presence of a distinct synthrophic consortium in TF5. Surprisingly, members assigned to hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota were common to both brines, indicating that these cold habitats host the most thermally tolerant Archaea. The patterns of microbial communities were different, coherently with the observed microbiological diversity between TF4 and TF5 brines. Both the influence exerted by upward movement of saline brines from a sub-surface anoxic system and the possible occurrence of an ancient ice remnant from the Ross Ice Shelf were the likely main factors shaping the microbial communities.					; Papale, Maria/AAC-6049-2020; Rizzo, Carmen/S-6285-2019; azzaro, Maurizio/AAE-6784-2019; azzaro, maurizio/A-9559-2017; Romano Spica, Vincenzo/V-5718-2019; Gugliandolo, Concetta/L-6855-2015; Caruso, Gabriella/F-5450-2013; Conte, Alessandra/JTJ-0650-2023	Conte, Antonella/0000-0002-6338-2961; Rizzo, Carmen/0000-0002-4340-3833; Rappazzo, Alessandro Ciro/0000-0002-3875-7338; azzaro, maurizio/0000-0001-7885-2340; la ferla, rosabruna/0000-0003-1029-7349; Gugliandolo, Concetta/0000-0002-9125-3999; Caruso, Gabriella/0000-0002-3819-5486; 														2076-2607				SEP	2019	7	9							333	10.3390/microorganisms7090333	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms7090333								31505750					WOS:000489131300060
J	WOOTTON, RJ; MILLS, LA				WOOTTON, RJ; MILLS, LA			ANNUAL CYCLE IN FEMALE MINNOWS PHOXINUS-PHOXINUS (L) FROM AN UPLAND WELSH LAKE	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												A population of P. phoxinus in a small, upland Welsh lake [UK] was sampled at monthly intervals between Feb. 1976-Jan. 1977. Mature females belonged to the 1972, 1973 and 1974 year classes. Spawning took place in May and June over gravel at the lake''s edge. Regression analysis provided estimates of the mean carcass, ovary and liver weights expected for a female 65 mm long. The ovarian weight increased rapidly in spring but dropped sharply between May and August. Carcass and liver weight declined during the breeding season, but recovered rapidly on completion of breeding. The increase in the weight of the ovary was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of dry matter, while the carcass and liver became relatively hydrated during the breeding season. Also at this time, the energy and lipid content of the carcass was low, but the ash content was high. Thus ovarian maturation and breeding were associated with a depletion of the carcass and liver, but this was quickly reversed at the end of the breeding season. Preliminary estimates of the changes in total energy in the ovary and carcass during ovarian maturation were made, which suggested that the decline in the energy content of the carcass represented a significant proportion of the gain in energy content of the ovary. The sampling period coincided with an unusually severe drought; the possible consequences of this on the population were considered.																				1095-8649					1979	14	6					607	618																WOS:A1979HF73500013

The capabilities of the method are demonstrated through three different environmental applications in Hungary. Lake Balaton is the largest lake in central Europe. It is suspected that the atmosphere is an important source of environmental deterioration of the Lake, relative to the pollutant supply by rivers and direct discharges. Thin-window EPMA results of around 25,000 individual particles indicated that the composition of the aerosol did not show characteristic seasonal variation, it was more correlated to the daily meteorological circumstances. A serious heavy metal pollution of the river Tisza occurred on 10 March 2000, from a mine-dumping site in Romania. Sediment samples were taken from the main riverbed at six sites, on 16 March 2000. In some of the samples, pyrite type particles were observed in high abundance, revealing their dumping-site origin. Biomass burning for energy production has been increased recently, mostly in households and for space heating. Fly-ash and bottom-ash samples were collected at a 600kW heating plant at Szodliget during standard winter operation. Most particles contained over 65% of unburned organic substance. The concentrations of major elements were obtained for each individual particle using thin-window EPMA, providing accurate matrix composition for further mu-XRF investigations of the trace element composition.

Upon project completion calculations indicated that 97% of the PCB was deposited in a landfill with subsequent low transport to the surroundings, and that 2.9 kg was left in the lake sediment. Concentrations of PCB that were measured weekly in the water leaving the lake were 12 ng/L (geometric mean) during dredging, not exceeding 30 ng/L and not significantly higher than in investigations preceeding the remedial action. The concentration of PCB was negatively correlated to water discharge and positively correlated to water temperature. PCB transport in the river was correlated to water discharge but not to the dredging activity. During dredging of the most contaminated part of the lake, the dredging area was screened off by a geotextile silt curtain that reduced leakage of PCB to the river downstream.																			0049-6979					OCT	1998	107	1-4					237	250		10.1023/A:1019879000011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1019879000011													WOS:000075808500016

Inlet Hydraulics of Chilika Lagoon	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Inlet hydraulics of Chilika Lagoon is studied using various observed inlet parameters (tide, current and morphology) and computing parameters such as hydraulic radius, inlet impedance, King's inlet frequency and friction, maximum channel velocity, phase lag and repletion coefficient during 2009 for spring and neap tide conditions. It is revealed that maximum water level variation in the lagoon occurs during May and is associated with wind-tide interaction in the absence of freshwater discharge. Results indicate ebb dominance of inlet during wet period (July to December) and flood dominance during dry period (February to May) of the lagoon. Period of maximum ebb current (July) coincides with the period of maximum fresh water discharge while period of maximum flood current (May) coincides with the period of maximum momentum input and percentage of sea distribution. Ebb dominance of the inlet is also revealed through computation and analysis of hydraulic parameters, primarily repletion values. Keeping in view the role of inlet hydraulics on the cotemporary phase of lagoon transformation, integration of inlet management into the overall ecosystem management of the lagoon is suggested.					; MOHANTY, PRATAP/E-8254-2014	Mohanty, Pratap Kumar/0000-0002-1188-2008; Gorozabel, Robinson/0000-0001-5822-5411; Sahoo, Rabindra Kumar/0000-0003-2644-3988; 													0379-5136	0975-1033				JAN	2016	45	1					137	144																WOS:000380625400016

Four environments can be distinguished: deeper marine areas (10-20 m); shallow subtidal platforms and banks (2-10 m); intertidal and supratidal zones; and coastal springs and lakes fed by saline continental groundwaters. The sediments are predominately bioclastic carbonate sands; muddy sediments occur in protected intertidal environments. The most common grain types are gastropods, bivalves, foraminifera, coralline algae and quartz. Indurated nonskeletal carbonate grains were not seen. Composition of the sediment varies little between environments, but considerable textural variation results from variation in the stability of the substrate, hydrodynamic conditions, depth of water, period of tidal inundation, supply of terrigenous grains, temperature and salinity. The Spencer Gulf data suggests that temperature, particularly minimum temperature, controls the distribution of skeletal and nonskeletal grain associations in high-salinity environments. The textures of the sedimentary facies of Spencer Gulf closely parallel those of equivalent environments in warm-water carbonate provinces.

We applied body length/carbon regression equations (LCR) obtained under controlled laboratory conditions and directly from field data on carbon and body length to field data on length-specific abundance. Laboratory-derived equations satisfactorily described our field estimates of length-specific carbon content in spring. As the length-standardized carbon content decreased exponentially along the season, we included time of the year as an auxiliary variable, and tested whether it affected slope, intercept or both. The decrease had no effect on slope but reduced the intercept of the LCR. We also calculated biomass, using a single mean value from the literature. By comparing the results with those obtained by simple conversion of individuals number into carbon we might discriminate between the effect of changes in the size frequency distribution of the population and the decrease with time of the length-standardized carbon content. Although we tested the different models for non-ovigerous females, the results did not change when we included also data on females with eggs in the first three developmental stages, whereas they changed substantially when we included females with embryos. We formulate two hypotheses to explain this result and discuss possible implications for the calculation of the standing stock biomass of Daphnia population.

Understanding the main controls on deposition and the link to the unique tectonic setting of the South Atlantic during the Early Cretaceous is paramount in successful exploration. Observations from conjugate regional seismic lines between the Kwanza and South Campos basins define the key megasequences as pre-rift, rift, sag, salt basin, post-salt carbonates and post-salt clastic sediments. The pre-salt stratigraphy can be described by three significant phases. In the first phase, the synrift lakes (Valanginian-Hauterivian), representing the onset of continental break-up and the formation of synrift graben, created several deep basins leading to overfilled freshwater lakes. In the second phase, Sag 1 (Barremian-Aptian), there was widespread subsidence created by syn-kinematic stretching of the continental crust and/or continuous rifting. Lacustrine sediments composed of coarse Pelecypod coquina with moderate faunal diversity are found, suggesting a fresh to brackish, balanced-filled, interconnected lake. In the third phase, Sag 2 (Aptian), there was continuous subsidence and isolation of the lake. Base level falls below sea-level resulted in an under-filled, alkaline and hypersaline lake with widespread microbialite growth. Based on the integration of seismic data, well data, biostratigraphy and tectonic models, a regional predictive model has been developed for reservoirs in phases 2 and 3.																			0305-8719		978-1-78620-243-7				2017	438						77	98		10.1144/SP438.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP438.10													WOS:000399498100005

Muradiye and Caldiran towns are located in Muradiye-Caldiran basin which is the subbasin of Lake Van basin. There is Tendurek Volcano in the north of the basin which is known as the most active volcano of the Turkey. Because of the study area has intense volcanic rocks, heavy metals were determined in the drinking waters on the investigations in region. Samples were collected from 31 sample points including 20 springs and 11 wells. Heavy metals such as As, Al, Cu, Zn, Cr, Mn, Ni, Ba and Sb were investigated as analysed water samples. Investigations were evaluated based on TSE 266 (March 2013, Water Regulation for Intended Human Consumption), (EPA, 2016) - (Environmental Protection Agency) and (WHO, 2011) - (World Health Organisation). In the result of the investigation, some heavy metals such as As, Al, Cr, Mn, Zn and Ni have high values which are above the limit values. The waters shouldn not be drunk because of the negative effects of heavy metals which were detected in drinking water for human health.

J	Delclaux, F; Coudrain, A; Condom, T				Delclaux, Francois; Coudrain, Anne; Condom, Thomas			Evaporation estimation on Lake Titicaca: a synthesis review and modelling	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The aim of this study was to validate evaporation models that can be used for palaeo-reconstructions of large lake water levels. Lake Titicaca, located in a high-altitude semi-arid tropical area in the northern Andean Altiplano, was the object of this case study. As annual evaporation is about 90% of lake output, the lake water balance depends heavily on the yearly and monthly evaporation flux. At the interannual scale, evaporation estimation presents great variability, ranging from 1350 to 1900 mm year(-1). It has been found that evaporation is closely related to lake rainfall by a decreasing relationship integrating the implicit effect of nebulosity and humidity. At the seasonal scale, two monthly evaporation data sets were used: pan observations and estimations derived from the lake energy budget. Comparison between these data sets shows that (i) there is one maximum per year for pan evaporation and two maxima per year for lake evaporation, and (ii) pan evaporation is greater than lake evaporation by about 100 mm year(-1). These differences, mainly due to a water depth scale factor, have been simulated with a simple thermal model theta(w),(h, t) of a free-surface water column. This shows that pan evaporation (h = 0.20 m) is strongly correlated with direct solar radiation, whereas the additional maximum of lake evaporation (h = 40 m) is related to the heat restitution towards the atmosphere from the water body at the end of summer. Finally, five monthly evaporation models were tested in order to obtain the optimal efficiency/complexity ratio. When the forcing variables are limited to those that are most readily available in the past, i.e. air temperature and solar radiation, the best results are obtained with the radiative Abtew model (r = 0.70) and with the Makkink radiative/air temperature model (r = 0.67).

The behaviour of glaciers is determined largely by the processes and conditions operating at their base. Technological advances have allowed these factors to be examined and their contribution to ice flow constrained. This study investigated the rapid disintegration of an aquatic based Norwegian glacier, through the study of boreholes, video, ground-penetrating radar, differential global positioning system, bathymetry and Glacsweb wireless probes. Briksdalsbreen retreated dramatically between 2000 and 2007, with c. 56 x 10(5) m(3) of ice lost from the glacier tongue, equivalent to a rate of 70 m a(-1). This was due to the combined effect of higher summer temperatures, decreased precipitation (resulting from a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation) and increased fracturing of the glacier tongue. The enlargement of a proglacial lake played a key role in Brikdalsbreen's rapid retreat, allowing calving events and promoting crevassing and fluctuating water contents at the glacier margin. We suggest that hydro-fracturing was the dominant mechanism responsible for generating more crevasses each year, which facilitated the development of an efficient englacial drainage system. This fed increasing quantities of water to the bed, where it was stored in subglacial cavities and transferred through a distributed ('slow') drainage system. However, despite this increase in subglacial water content, ice velocities remained constant during the break-up. Comparisons are made between the processes observed at Briksdalsbreen and those associated with the acceleration and rapid retreat of Greenland's tidewater glaciers.					; Hart, Jane/J-4321-2012	Martinez, Kirk/0000-0003-3859-5700; Hart, Jane/0000-0002-2348-3944													0016-7649	2041-479X				MAY	2011	168	3					673	688		10.1144/0016-76492010-024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/0016-76492010-024													WOS:000289937800004

Understanding the ecological impacts of storms on the dynamics of primary producers remains a challenge that needs to be addressed to assess the vulnerability of freshwater ecosystems to extreme weather conditions and climate change. One promising approach to gain insights into storm impacts on phytoplankton community dynamics is to analyse long-term monitoring datasets. However, such an approach requires disentangling the impacts of short-term meteorological disturbances from the effects of the seasonal trajectories of meteorological conditions. To this end, we applied boosted regression tree models to phytoplankton time series from eight relatively large lakes on four continents, coupled with a procedure adapted to detect and quantify rare events. Overall, the patterns and potential drivers we identified provide important insights into the responses of lakes to short-term meteorological events and highlight differences in the response of phytoplankton communities according to lake morphological characteristics. Our results indicated that deepened thermoclines and lake-specific combinations of drivers describing altered thermal structures caused deviations from the typical trajectories of seasonal phytoplankton succession. For shallow polymictic lakes, shifts in phytoplankton succession also depended on changes in light availability. Overall, our study highlights the value of long-term monitoring to improve our understanding of phytoplankton sensitivity to short-term meteorological disturbances.

J	Zhu, D; Zhou, XF; Cheng, W				Zhu, Dun; Zhou, Xuefan; Cheng, Wei			Water effects on urban heat islands in summer using WRF-UCM with gridded urban canopy parameters - A case study of Wuhan	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT												Urbanization has rapidly occurred in China along with a significant reduction in ecological resources, greatly exacerbating urban heat island effect. In cities with abundant inland lake resources, it is valuable to study the use of climate regulation effects of water bodies to improve the urban climate environment. In this study, we built a single-layer urban canopy model with higher accuracy by importing gridded urban canopy parameters and studied the impact of water bodies distributed in different areas of Wuhan on the urban thermal environment using a weather research and forecasting model (WRF). Water bodies located in the upwind suburbs had the greatest cooling impact on the microclimate of downtown areas during the day. Furthermore, they promote the evacuation of heat inside the urban canopy to the upper air by enhancing the lake breeze circulation. Late morning temperatures drop above the ground when the breeze circulation fully develops, while the temperature rise in the upper air increases. However, the cooling effect of these water bodies on the downtown area was affected by construction intensity in the suburbs. When the building density increased from 20% to 40%, the cooling effect did not change significantly. However, a further increase from 40% to 60% increased the pro-portion of intense heat island areas downtown, and the cooling effect of water bodies was also severely weak-ened. Moreover, with an increase in building density in the suburbs, the intense heat island areas north of the city gradually expanded to the city center.

Impact of glacier changes on ecosystem of proglacial lakes in high mountain regions of East Siberia (Russia)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mountain lakes in East Siberia have been studied for recent changes in water chemistry, turbidity and diatom assemblages preserved in bottom sediments. We performed a regional analysis of the relative effect of climate and glacier changes on change in diatom diversity and supply of meltware in proglacial lakes. We analysed sediment records from East Siberian glacier lakes using geochemical and diatoms proxies. We found that dramatic changes in communities and abundance of diatoms and biogenic proxy could be induced by low nutrient concentrations in glacial lakes and high turbidity due to active degradation of glaciers and snow patches as a result of the global increase in temperature in the Northern Hemisphere. Our evidences show that diatoms have been gradually decreased since ca. the 1880s. A significant tendency towards diatom reducing occurred at high summer regional temperatures. This tendency may be attributed to the fact that glaciers and snow patches thawed actively in East Siberia during ca. 1880-1958, which was induced by the beginning of the Recent Warming (ca. 1850-1860) and a long period of relatively warm regional climate from ca. 1900 to 1960.

Dummy carcasses, constructed by stretching duck skins over wooden forms, were used to assess the reaction of waterbirds to carcasses. There was no significant difference in the number of American coots, ducks, grebes, or total birds present when dummy carcasses were or were not present. Only one of 42 freshly-dead bird carcasses marked and observed twice each day was removed by a scavenger prior to the development of large maggots. Maggots developed in all carcasses and were visible externally a mean of 3.9 days after placement of the carcasses. The effectiveness of carcass collection and disposal operations was tested by marking carcasses on the day prior to two scheduled clean-ups. Only 32% of marked carcasses were recovered. Large carcasses and carcasses on or near islands were recovered at a higher frequency than were small carcasses and carcasses not near islands, respectively.																			0090-3558					JAN	1993	29	1					8	14		10.7589/0090-3558-29.1.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-29.1.8								8445793					WOS:A1993KL11900002

Coupled atmospheric transport model and modeled concentrations in air and soil	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A coupled atmospheric transport, soil-air, water-air exchange model was developed to investigate the impacts of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH or lindane) usage in the Canadian prairies over the Great Lakes region. The fate of gamma-HCH in air and soil is governed by atmospheric dynamics and physical and chemical processes that are described by the coupled model. These processes include transport and turbulent diffusion in the atmosphere, dry and wet deposition, exchange at the interfacial boundaries of air-water and soil-air, and removal processes from the soil such as diffusion, leaching, and degradation. Numerical experiments were conducted for the period of May 1, 1998-April 30,1999, starting with application of lindane in the spring. The coupled model was executed with two lindane emission (usage) inventories in the model domain. The first scenario contained all known fresh emission sources in Canada-98% was usage in the prairies; the second excluded emission sources from Ontario and Quebec. The model showed that, in the absence of the reemission from past application of lindane, usage of lindane in Ontario and Quebec has a negligible impact on air concentrations in these regions and that the lindane budget in the Great Lakes ecosystem is mostly attributed to applications of lindane in the canola fields in Canadian prairie provinces. Model-predicted air concentrations and seasonal trends agreed well with measured data over the same time period for several background sites operated under the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network. Air temperature was shown to play a key role on surface-air exchange dynamics of gamma-HCH. A future paper will assess loadings to the Great Lakes based on these validated model results.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 1	2003	37	17					3774	3781		10.1021/es034160x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es034160x								12967095					WOS:000185057500025

The annual PCB inputs were similar, and the glacial runoff and sediment-to-water exchange were negligible sources of PCBs to the water column relative to atmospheric deposition. The annual inputs were primarily introduced by snow deposition and transferred into the lakes during the few weeks of spring thaw. While the dominant deposition pathways were similar, the main processes by which the water column lost pollutants differed between the two lakes. Despite these differences, the mass budget revealed that PCB inputs exceeded outputs for both studied lakes and that the lakes acted as atmospheric PCB sinks for the surrounding mountain environment The differences in the PCB distribution between the key compartments (sediment and water column) are most likely due to differences in the lacustrine internal processes.

Small (15 L) enclosures were filled with natural or screened (100 mum) lake water and incubated for 5 days in the lake. Screening removed crustacean zooplankton but the initial density of rotifers and phytoplankton remained the same in control and removal treatments. Changes in the abundance and biomass of bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton (APP), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates were measured daily. 3. The crustacean zooplankton, dominated by the small cladoceran Chydorus sphaericus, did not affect cyanobacteria, the main phytoplankton group during the experiment. 4. The removal of the crustacean zooplankton induced a higher abundance of ciliates and reduced that of the HNF, indicating the importance of ciliates in controlling HNF in this system.

Woodlands in this RNA are comparable to areas dominated by singleleaf pinyon over much of the western and central Great Basin. Total vegetal cover on 17 sampled macroplots from the site ranged from 21 to about 70 percent. These plots had a total of 95 plant species, Patterns of understory suppression with increasing tree dominance were similar to those measured on other sites. Comparison of aerial photographs of the RNA from 1940 and from 1993 made it possible to document the increases in the area dominated by pinyon over the 53 years. In 1940 nearly 60 percent of the site was dominated by mature trees and was 30 percent shrub dominated. By 1993 nearly 70 percent was dominated by mature trees and only 12 percent was shrub dominated. The remainder in both cases were areas with invading young trees intermixed with old-growth woodland.																									1998		11					71	77																WOS:000084980500013

Gamonts and oocysts cause nodular infection of enterocytes in specific portions of the gut. Besides those present in the nodules, merozoites and gamonts occur diffusely in the epithelium of the intestine and the pyloric sacs. The different developmental stages are located in the apical cytoplasm of enterocytes and are released from the cells in unsporulated condition. The sporulation of oocysts takes 48 h in tap-water at 20 degrees C. The oocysts, which are 13-13.5 mu m in diameter in an unsporulated state, grow to 17-20 mu m by the end of the sporulation process, and ellipsoidal sporocysts composed of 2 valves and containing banana-shaped sporozoites develop in them.

First of all, length scale parameters in torsion and bending are assessed for bone micro-samples on the basis of experimental data proposed by Yang and Lakes. Then, the effect of micro-rotations on the torsion and bending of single osteons is studied and compared with experimental results obtained by Ascenzi et al., and the length scale parameter of osteons is consequently obtained. According to the present study on osteons and using an approximate formulation of multi-layered tubes under torsion, a material length scale parameter of lamellae is acquired to capture the size effect. These achievements lead to introducing a hierarchical structure for the material length scale parameter of the modified couple stress theory. In addition, the buckling, static nonlinear response, torsional vibration, and flexural dispersion analyses of osteons are presented.					; Soltani, Delara/KTI-7450-2024; Khorshidi, Majid/AFP-7696-2022	Soltani, Delara/0000-0001-9383-2268; aAkbarzadeh Khorshidi, Majid/0000-0002-2210-0876													0001-5970	1619-6937				JAN	2021	232	1					73	88		10.1007/s00707-020-02837-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00707-020-02837-x		OCT 2020											WOS:000579782200001

During the late 1970s, the nutrient input reached a maximum of approximately 1.9/11.5 g TP/TN M-2 yr(-1). As a result, the lake became a hypertrophic ecosystem and had largely lost its recreational value. In 1980, the sewage discharge was stopped, decreasing the external loading by approximately 90%. Because of vast amounts of phosphorus stored in the sediment, the lake remained highly eutrophic until 1985 with a TP concentration of ca. 1 mg L-1. To accelerate recovery, biomanipulation was applied from 1985 to 2002 but was successful to only a minor extent. Eventually, due to sediment sequestration and discharge to downstream lakes the TP spring maximum (2006-2010) dropped to 0.112-0.078 mg L-1. However, given the trend, it was obvious that it would take another 10-15 years for the concentration to approach the desired mesotrophic level. Thus, it was suggested to inactivate the surplus phosphorus by treating the lake with poly-aluminium chloride (PAC) as precipitant. To ensure good water quality, the objective was to decrease concentrations below 0.035 mg TP L-1, while optimising the amount of PAC applied (as much as needed, but as little as possible). As a prerequisite, the status of the lake was carefully studied; external phosphorus loading and the amount of mobile phosphorus stored in the sediment being of specific interest. Laboratory experiments, modelling studies and field observations eventually resulted in an estimated dosage of 27 g Al M-2 (molar Al/P 12). Following the treatment in April 2011, prime water quality parameters showed two opposing trends: (1) TP concentration immediately dropped below the restoration target (<= 0.025/0.035 mg L-1), primary production and phytoplankton biomass declined substantially. (2) However, water clarity did not improve for another four years. The likely reason for the delay was the structure of the phytoplankton community. It was dominated by cyanobacteria with the potential to trigger intensive calcite precipitation and thus impair transparency. In spring 2015, the cyanobacteria suddenly disappeared and transparency increased significantly. We speculate that these changes of the planktonic community shifted the ratio of assimilation and respiration in favour of the latter. This allowed an increase of free CO2* (dissolved CO2 & dissociated carbonic acid) altering the carbonate buffering system and thus halting the formation of calcite crystals. Also, the phytoplankton, now represented by small readily ingestible taxa, promoted a flourishing Daphnia population inflicting heavy grazing losses, resulting in clear water stages (2015 June, 4.20 m; 2016, August 3.70 m; 2017 August, 4.5 m). We conclude that the drastic decrease of phosphorus availability in concert with structural and functional changes of the plankton community eventually improved the water quality of Haussee significantly.

Samples of sea water collected off Plymouth contained 0.7-1 mg. Mn per cu.m.; after storage and sedimentation of particulate matter 0.0-0.25 mg. Mn per cu.m . This agreed with biological estimations made with Mn-starved flagellates. Samples collected in the Irish Sea, in an area with a rich summer population of autotrophic flagellates, contained 2-2.6 mg. Mn per cu.m. The river Yealm (South Devon) on leaving Dartmoor contained 1 mg. per cu.m. and after passing through agricultural land 10 mg. cu.m. Lakes and streams in the English Lake District contained 6-40 mg. cu.m, the least fertile waters containing the least Mn.																			0025-3154	1469-7769					1949	28	1					155	164		10.1017/S0025315400055260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315400055260													WOS:A1949XR27800007
J	Rao, YR; Marvin, CH; Zhao, J				Rao, Yerubandi R.; Marvin, Christopher H.; Zhao, Jun			Application of a numerical model for circulation, temperature and pollutant distribution in Hamilton Harbour	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The restoration of Hamilton Harbour, from an environmental standpoint, is a current concern for the agencies involved with remediation efforts in the harbour. Estimates of circulation and mixing are needed to assess the fate and transport of water quality constituents in the harbour. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling system (ELCOM) is used to study the circulation and thermal structure in the harbour. The model results were compared with profiles of temperature at several moorings and currents and water levels in the harbour. The model showed considerable skill in reproducing the thermal structure, surface currents and water levels. Mean summer circulation in the harbour showed two counter-rotating gyres occupying the harbour. The model produced harbour-lake exchange characteristics are in agreement with previous studies. Simulations using passive tracers qualitatively agreed with chemical tracer studies conducted near a sewage treatment plant outfall. The accuracy of these simulations suggests that the model is capable of describing flow and transport of material required for detailed water quality simulations.

J	Hope, D; Kratz, TK; Riera, JL				Hope, D; Kratz, TK; Riera, JL			Relationship between P-CO2 and dissolved organic carbon in northern Wisconsin lakes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												We investigated un relationships between early summer partial pressures of CO2 (P-CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the surface waters of 27 northern Wisconsin lakes. other variables we considered were die drainage ratio, lake area, lake depth and the extent of wetland in each drainage basin. P-CO2, had a strong positive relationship with MW: concentration. There was a weak negative relationship between P-CO2, and lake area, which was most apparent In lakes with DOC concentrations: above 5 mg L(-1). DOC concentration was positively correlated with the drainage ratio and wetland extent. We conclude that allochthonous C supplied by the drainage basin, particularly from areas of wetland, is a major factor determining CO2 saturation of these lakes and suggest that there are two complementary mechanisms by which this can occur. Higher P-CO2, may result from higher in-lake respiration of the allochthonous organic carbon, and/or from inputs of surface waters from wetlands that are high in both WC and CO2.

Changes in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) coverage caused by extended drought and flood pulses	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Shivers SD, Golladay SW, Waters MN, Wilde SB, Ashford PD, Covich AP. 2018. Changes in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) coverage caused by extended drought and flood pulses. Lake Reserv Manage. 34:199210.Previous studies demonstrated that submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) affects productivity and biogeochemical cycling within freshwater ecosystems. Some invasive submerged macrophytes dominate shallow water bodies and are known to compete for nutrients with native macrophytes and phytoplankton. To evaluate variation in SAV coverage, annual whole-reservoir vegetation surveys were conducted during the peak of the growing season over a 3-yr period that included drought and years with seasonal flood pulses. Physical parameters were directly measured (Photosynthetically Active Radiation: PAR) or obtained from USGS river gauges (river discharge and turbidity) to investigate the relationship between hydrology and SAV coverage. Precipitation was lower in the first year of the study compared to the following 2 yr causing the lowest river discharge observed over the 3-yr study. First-year discharge was also lower than the 50-yr median daily Q (discharge). SAV coverage, particularly of dioecious Hydrilla verticillata, was the greatest during the reduced flow period (35.5 km(2)). With increasing precipitation and river discharge, SAV coverage was reduced during subsequent years (22.9 km(2) and 18.3 km(2), respectively). Increased discharge caused turbidity to increase, which reduced light availability during the early growing season, causing a delay in germination and subsequent reduction in SAV coverage. In shallow reservoirs, SAV is capable of extensive coverage. Thus, large variation in coverage can alter ecosystem functionality. In regulated river systems, managing late spring flood pulses may provide some control of SAV coverage in shallow reservoirs, in addition to providing other environmental flow benefits.

J	CATTANEO, A; KALFF, J				CATTANEO, A; KALFF, J			SEASONAL-CHANGES IN EPIPHYTE COMMUNITY OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL MACROPHYTES IN LAKE MEMPHREMAGOG (QUE + VT)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal changes in the epiphyte biomass, measured both as chlorophyll a and as cell volume, and species composition were compared on Potamogeton richardsonii and on a similar plastic plant grown together in a shallow bay of Lake Memphremagog (45.degree.06''N, 72.degree.16''W). Both substrates exhibited 2 periods of high biomass during the June-Sept. growing season: one in June, when the community was dominated by loosely attached species with a strong planktonic component (up to 37%), and one in Sept., when the epiphytes were characterized by species tightly attached to the leaves. Although this seasonal trend was similar, the loosely and tightly attached communities were best developed on the natural and artificial plants, respectively. The diversity of the epiphytes was significantly higher on the natural than on the artificial leaves from July on. Both the diversity differences and differences in community structure appear to be the result of the summer accumulation of CaCO3 observed only on the upper leaf surfaces of the natural plants. Consequently, P. richardsonii appears to affect epiphyte development largely by its precipitation of CaCO3, with no evidence for either direct inhibition or stimulation of the epiphytes by the natural plants. The reduced epiphyte biomass on growing tips was no different from that on artificial plants of the same age and exposure and is attributable to an insufficient time for colonization rather than to inhibition by the macrophyte.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1978	60	2					135	144		10.1007/BF00163179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00163179													WOS:A1978FP61100006
J	West, RJ; King, RJ				West, RJ; King, RJ			Marine, brackish, and freshwater fish communities in the vegetated and bare shallows of an Australian Coastal River	ESTUARIES												Fish communities found in the marine, brackish, and freshwater shallows of the Clarence River (New South Wales, Australia) were sampled over a 12-mo period to compare communities inhabiting bare and vegetated substrata. A total of 26,107 fish representing 57 species and 36 families was collected bimonthly using a 6-mm mesh seine. Permanent residents (i.e., species found throughout the year) were primarily gobies (Gobiidae) and gudgeons (Eleotridae). Juveniles of many species found as adults in other parts of the river were seasonally abundant in the shallows. Most numerous was a small ambassid, the glassy perchlet (Ambassis jacksoniensis), the majority of which was collected from marine and brackish regions of the river. Firetail gudgeons (Hypseleotris compressus) were caught in highest numbers at the freshwater sites. Cluster analysis suggested that fish communities in widely separated vegetated sites were more similar to each other than to those in adjacent bare sites. Shallow vegetated (Zostera capricorni) habitats in the marine region of the river had greatest diversity and highest abundances of fish, particularly during recruitment periods. At these times, juveniles of many commercially important species were captured, including yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), sea muller (Mugil cephalus), flat-tail mullet (Liza agentea), tarwhine (Rhabdosargus sarba), luderick (Girella tricuspidata), silver biddy (Gerres subfasciatus), and sand whiting (Sillago ciliata). The vegetated (Vallismeria gigantea) sites in the brackish region also had significantly more species and individuals during recruitment periods (spring) than bare sites. Although freshwater vegetated sites consistently had more individuals than freshwater bare sites, there were no significant differences in species richness between vegetated and bare habitats. The need to conservatively manage shallow-water fish habitats is stressed.

J	Kumiko, T; Takao, M; Toru, M				Kumiko, Tsujimoto; Takao, Masumoto; Toru, Mitsuno			Seasonal changes in radiation and evaporation implied from the diurnal distribution of rainfall in the Lower Mekong	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Solar radiation is an important input to many empirical equations for estimating evaporation, which in turn plays all important role in the hydrologic cycle in the Lower Mekong River Basin due to the high evaporation potential of the tropical monsoon climate. Few proper meteorological data exist for the Lower Mekong River Basin, however, and the region's meteorological conditions, including seasonal variation in radiation and evaporation, have not been clarified. In this study, ground-based hourly hydrometeorological data were collected at three observation stations located in different land-Use types (urban district, paddy area, and lake) in the Lower Mekong River Basin. These data were analysed to investigate the seasonal variation ill radiation and evaporation related to the diurnal distribution of rainfall. Contrary to common expectations, our results showed that rainy and dry seasons had nearly the same amount of solar radiation in the Lower Mekong River Basin because (1) rainy seasons had a relatively larger amount of extraterrestrial radiation; (2) no rain fell oil nearly half of the days during rainy seasons; and (3) the amount of solar radiation on rainy days reached 88% of that on non-rainy days. The third factor was attributed to the high frequency of evening rainfall. Furthermore, this rainfall-radiation relationship meant that rainy seasons had a large amount of net radiation due to the low reduction ratio of solar radiation and an increase in long-wave incoming radiation. Accordingly, rainy seasons had a high evaporation potential. Moreover, for the rain-fed rice paddies that prevail in this region, sufficient radiation during the rainy season Would be a great advantage for rice growing.

A set of oligonucleotide primers was developed that permitted the selective amplification of 16S rRNA gene sequences of this group. Subsequently, amplification products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequenced, which yielded a total of 19 novel sequence types. Ten of the sequences were related to those of different cultivated members of the Chloroflexus assemblage, whereas nine fell into the T78 group of environmental clones. For the latter subgroup of the green nonsulfur bacteria, no molecular isolate from freshwater plankton has been reported so far. Several of the sequence types occurred in more than one lake, indicating that not only relatives of the Chloroflexus assemblage, but also bacteria of the clone T78 group represent indigenous bacteria of nonthermal stratified freshwater ecosystems. Our results indicate that the natural diversity in the phylum of the green nonsulfur bacteria has been significantly underestimated in the past.					; B.

According to this framework, racial prejudice and perceptions of economic and social threat are likely to have an important influence on residents' reactions to the evacuees. In the "Katrina in my Community Study," the authors surveyed 532 residents from Colorado Springs, CO, Salt Lake City, UT, and San Antonio, TX-three cities that had African American populations well below the national average and that received large numbers of Katrina evacuees. The respondent's evaluations of and judgments about the evacuees, including overall attitudes and support for continued assistance, were explained to a greater extent by perceived threat and prejudice than by their actual experiences with the evacuees. Thus, at least in predominantly White communities, race and subjective feelings of threat may frame decisions about helping newcomers to a community, even when need is salient.

J	ANDERSON, JM				ANDERSON, JM			SOME AQUATIC VEGETATION CHANGES FOLLOWING FISH REMOVAL	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												A semi-quantitative survey of the vegetation of Middle Harbor was made during the growing seasons prior to and following fish removal in Oct., 1948. Before treating the lake with rotenone, a 10-cm. Secchi disc disappeared at a depth of 10 in. in quiet water. In the summer following treatment, the disc was visible in the deepest area at over 4 ft. The frequency of occurrence of 18 spp. of aquatic plants is compared for 1948 and 1949. Only an occasional specimen of Myriophyllum exalbescens, Potamogeton pectinatus, or P. crispus could be recovered by dragging the lake bottom in 1948. In 1949, a wire hoop, 2 ft. in diam. was dropped over the side of a rowboat at 50 ft. intervals. The no. and spp. of plants within the circle were recorded. Chara vulgaris, not found in 1948, occurred in 95% of the samples in 1949. Potamogeton pectinatus, very rare in 1948, occurred in 28%. Naias marina, not found in 1948, occurred in 2%. Myriophyllum occurred in 5%, Potamogeton crispus in 0.1%; neither sp. having made a significant change in abundance. About 6000 Valisneria americana tubers were sown April 24, 1949. The planting appeared successful, although comparable growth was noted in some areas where the tubers were not sown. The above sp. made up about 95% of the bottom vegetation. A sparse growth of emergent and floating leaved species made no significant change in abundance.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1950	14	2					206	209		10.2307/3796334	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3796334													WOS:A1950YB64900019

In the presence of zooplanktivorous fish, more than 80 % of C. hirundinella cells had an hypotheca with two horns. In the enclosures without fish, we observed a highly significant increase in the proportion of C. hirundinella with three antapical horns. The proportion of C. hirundinella cells with three antapical horns tended to increase with nutrient loading, but this effect was not significant and no significant interaction effect between nutrients and fish was observed. Temperature profiles were similar in fish and fishless enclosures and could not explain the morphological variability of C. hirundinella. Our results show that biotic factors should be taken into account in polymorphism studies on Ceratium. Frequently invoked hypotheses based only on water temperature, nutrient availability or turbulence level, may not be sufficient to explain this phenomenon.

Chlorophyll (Chl.) a concentrations ranged from 0.7 to 5.8 mu gl(-1). Inorganic nutrient concentrations were low: soluble reactive phosphorus ranged from 0.05 to 0.20 mu mol l(-1), ammonia from 0.21 to 0.41 mu mol l(-1), and nitrite plus nitrate from 0.33 to 0.37 mu mol l(-1). In the five enrichment experiments, phosphate spikes and phosphate plus nitrate spikes always stimulated primary production. Nitrate spikes also stimulated primary production in four of the experiments. Significant differences were detected between the controls and phosphate spikes and between the controls and phosphate plus nitrate spikes. Thus, the first limiting nutrient is thought to be phosphorus, but once phosphorus is supplied to the surface water, the limiting nutrient will quickly shift from phosphorus to nitrogen.

J	MullerNavarra, D; Lampert, W				MullerNavarra, D; Lampert, W			Seasonal patterns of food limitation in Daphnia galeata: Separating food quantity and food quality effects	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Food limitation for the cladoceran Daphnia galeata was measured growing them with natural lake seston for one growing season under standardized conditions in the laboratory. Growth rates were related to several measures of food quantity. Particulate organic carbon (POC) <30 mu m was the best predictor of total food availability measured. It was better than chlorophyll-a (Chi-a) of the same size fraction, algal volume calculated from cell counts or total particle volume from Coulter Counter measurements. Daphnids were also grown with Scenedesmus acutus under the same conditions and their growth rates were compared. Sestonic carbon concentrations were related to Scenedesmus carbon concentrations, that provided equal growth rates. The ratio of the carbon concentrations of both food types (seston, Scenedesmus) represented the food quality of seston. Thus, the nutritional quality of natural lake seston relative to a standard alga was determined over one growing season. Growth rates of seston fed animals revealed that they were food limited during long periods of the year. This was also ascertained by standard clutch sizes of field animals. However, the causes of food limitation varied within the duration of the studied period. Whereas during the clear water phase the food quantity was limiting (while the quality was high; 100% Scenedesmus). shortly after on 10 June and 17 June food conditions were close to threshold concentrations due to low food quality. For the remainder of the summer, a POC of 0.3-0.6 mg C l(-1) with a quality of similar to 50% Scenedesmus, resulted in moderate food limitation of Daphnia.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1996	18	7					1137	1157		10.1093/plankt/18.7.1137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.7.1137													WOS:A1996VA52300004

This species has distinguished from the closest species, A. escherichii, by fever perforated scales along lateral line (44-48 vs. 46-53), dipper body depth (26.64 vs. 23.92% SL), shorter snout (25.54 vs. 27.55% HL) and larger eye diameter (31.22 vs. 27.88% HL). Our study has also examined the distribution area and habitat conditions of the species, clearly indicating that A. nasreddini distributed in only Akarcay basin (Eber, Aksehir and Karamik lakes; Selevir and Seyitler reservoirs; Kalli, Adiyan and Aksehir creeks) and Ilgin Lake Basin (Besgz Springs-Saraynu, Asagi Cigil Creek-Ilgin). Its observable population until very recently has disappeared from its type locality, Eber Lake, due to heavy pollution. Although its population present in Aksehir Lake is critically endangered due to the drought, presence of viable population in some dam lakes (especially in Selevir Reservoir) is considered as a promising picture with regard to the future of species.

Bacteria were very diverse in morphology, with filaments reaching up to 100 mu m long; flagellates, both autotrophic (chrysophytes, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, and volvocales) and heterotrophic, and ciliates were abundant, reaching biovolume values up to 2.7 x 10(6) mu m(3) ml(-1), Species composition was very variable, with dominance depending on date and depth, Although many species were typical of lake plankton communities, some were restricted to the slush, for instance the predatory ciliates Dileptus sp, and Lacrymaria sp., and others were restricted to the surface pools, such as the snow algae Chlamydomonas nivalis, Microbial biomasses and usually bacterial and algal activities were greater in the slush layers than in the lake water, Photosynthesis rate in the upper cover layers reached values up to 0.5 mu g of C liter(-1) h(-1), and high bacterial activities up to 226 pmol of leucine incorporated liter(-1) h(-1) and 25 pmol of thymidine incorporated liter(-1) h(-1) were measured. For most species, lake water flooding the ice and snow cover could provide an inoculum. Differential growth depending on the environmental conditions (nutrients, organic matter, light) of a particular slush layer could provide dominance of different groups or species, However, there was no obvious colonizing mechanism for those species not appearing either in plankton or in communities on top of the snowpack.

However, whether the Roman activities affected the hydrological balance of Iberian wetlands remains unclear. Here, we investigate the paleo-hydrology of Lake Zonar (southern Iberia) by using the stable isotopes (O-16, O-17, O-18, H-1 and H-2) of its gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O) sediments and reconstruct the isotopic composition of the lake water during Roman times. A period of recurrent lake low stand occurred between 2120 and 1890 cal. yr BP (ca. 170 BCE to 60 CE), coinciding with a relatively dry climate stage recorded by most regional paleoclimate archives. The stable isotopes and hydrochemistry of the lake water during gypsum precipitation are consistent with a shallow saline lake that evaporated under relative humidity similar to 10% lower than the present annual mean and at least 20% less rainfall amount. Our analytical and archeological findings support lake level lowering during the Roman period was probably caused by combined arid climate conditions and diversion of the inlets feeding the lake. Spring capturing was likely necessary to satisfy the high water demand of nearby Roman settlements, in the framework of a period of persistent droughts.

Origin of water salinity in a lake and coastal aquifer system	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY					International Congress on Groundwater in Mediterranean Countries	APR 24-28, 2006	Malaga, SPAIN					The studied area is in the Algerian Northeast. A number of interacting factors at the site are able to modify salinity. The main influences are: (1) The lithology, (2) Fedzara Lake, (3) marine waters, and (4) a prolonged drought. (1) The lithology is very clearly delineated by the outcrop of metamorphic formations (gneiss, marbles, micaschists, and quartzites) and sedimentary formations (limestones, clay, sandstones, and sands). All these formations can influence the chemical composition of waters. (2) Fedzara Lake evacuates its salted waters via the Wadi Meboudja, which connects with the Wadi Seybouse and the phreatic surface. These lake waters might induce changes in salinity. (3) The marine waters represent the third source of salinity change. Over-pumping of water from wells and drillings can cause an imbalance to the fresh-salted water interface. (4) The effects of a local prolonged drought of more than 10 years may increase water salinity. Over-pumping to augment water supply generates a fall in water levels and the drier atmosphere increases evapotranspiration. Both may contribute to increased salinity. Results of water analysis were used to observe the evolution of these various factors.

Combining Rate and Heat Summation Models for Digital Decisions Support	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												In this work, we use developmental rate models to predict egg laying activity and succession of generations of T. urticae populations under field conditions in the Prespa lakes region in Northern Greece. Moreover, the developmental rate model predictions are related to accumulated heat summations to be compared with actual bean damage and to generate pest-specific degree-day risk thresholds. The oviposition was predicted to start at 57.7 DD, while the first peak in egg laying was estimated to be at 141.8 DD. The second and third peak in egg production were predicted to occur at 321.1 and 470.5 DD, respectively. At the degree-day risk threshold, half development of the first summer generation was estimated at 187 DD and 234 DDm while for the second, it was estimated at 505 DD and 547 DD for 2021 and 2022, respectively. According to the model predictions, no significant differences were observed in the mean generation time (total egg to adult development) of T. urticae between the two observation years (t = 0.01, df = 15, p = 0.992). The total generation time was estimated at 249.3 (+/- 7.7) and 249.2 (+/- 6.7), for 2021 and 2022, respectively. The current models will contribute towards predictions of the seasonal occurrence and oviposition of T. urticae to be used in pest management decision-making. Moreover, the development of population model is a prerequisite for the buildup and implementation of smart plant protection solutions.

We track the moisture evolution since the Last Glacial Maximum using the trace element, rare earth element (REE) and stable isotope composition of ostracod shells. The sediment records covering the past 18.8 cal. ka BP and 17.4 cal. ka BP, respectively, demonstrate the suitability of REEs as indicators of weathering intensity and thus hydrological changes and moisture sources in the catchment. In Nam Co, high concentrations of light REEs between 14 and 13 cal. ka BP suggest an increased drainage from the glaciated Nyainqengtanglha Mountains in the south, pointing to meltwater input. REEs in ostracod shells therefore provide additional information on water sources critical for the interpretation of stable isotope records. Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios reflect salinity and thus changes in effective moisture. Asynchronous behavior of Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios are controlled by changes in dominance of precipitating carbonate minerals in the lake. Synchronous behavior reflects calcite precipitation, indicating low-Mg/Ca warm-wet conditions. Constantly low Sr/Ca ratios reflect aragonite precipitation, indicating high-Mg dry conditions. Increased Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca relative to Mg/Ca ratios show monohydrocalcite precipitation, indicating high-Mg/Ca cold-dry conditions. Furthermore, Fe/Ca, Mn/Ca and U/Ca ratios in ostracods reflect changes in oxygen saturation in lake bottom waters controlled by lake level and microbial activity. The paleoclimate histories reconstructed from Nam Co and Tangra Yumco show high similarity throughout the late Quaternary. We identified two major dry periods, corresponding to Heinrich 1 and the Younger Dryas, followed by strengthening in Indian summer monsoon precipitation. The early Holocene is characterized by a moisture maximum, reflecting abundant water supply by a strong ISM. A time-delayed shift to dry conditions occurred at 2.6 cal. ka BP at Tangra Yumco, and at 2 cal. ka BP at Nam Co, resulting in decreasing lake levels, caused by weakened monsoon intensity due to a southeastward migration of the ISM-Westerly boundary with an estimated velocity of approximately 600 m per year.					; Zhu, Liping/J-9352-2019; Frenzel, Peter/F-5247-2012; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023; Stuhr, Marleen/T-9771-2019	Schroder, Birgit/0000-0003-4807-6357; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; Stuhr, Marleen/0000-0001-9155-9464; Borner, Nicole/0000-0001-8833-6665; 														2296-6463				JUL 26	2022	10								826143	10.3389/feart.2022.826143	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.826143													WOS:000838388900001
J	Wiley, J; Mercer, A				Wiley, Jake; Mercer, Andrew			Synoptic Climatology of Lake-Effect Snow Events off the Western Great Lakes	CLIMATE												As the mesoscale dynamics of lake-effect snow (LES) are becoming better understood, recent and ongoing research is beginning to focus on the large-scale environments conducive to LES. Synoptic-scale composites are constructed for Lake Michigan and Lake Superior LES events by employing an LES case repository for these regions within the U.S. North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data for each LES event were used to construct synoptic maps of dominant LES patterns for each lake. These maps were formulated using a previously implemented composite technique that blends principal component analysis with a k-means cluster analysis. A sample case from each resulting cluster was also selected and simulated using the Advanced Weather Research and Forecast model to obtain an example mesoscale depiction of the LES environment. The study revealed four synoptic setups for Lake Michigan and three for Lake Superior whose primary differences were discrepancies in a surface pressure dipole structure previously linked with Great Lakes LES. These subtle synoptic-scale differences suggested that while overall LES impacts were driven more by the mesoscale conditions for these lakes, synoptic-scale conditions still provided important insight into the character of LES forcing mechanisms, primarily the steering flow and air-lake thermodynamics.

Water tracks in the High Arctic: a hydrological network dominated by rapid subsurface flow through patterned ground	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Water tracks play a major role in the headwater basin hydrology of permafrost landscapes in Alaska and Antarctica, but less is known about these features in the High Arctic. We examined the physical and hydrological properties of water tracks on Ward Hunt Island, a polar desert site in the Canadian High Arctic, to evaluate their formation process and to compare with water tracks reported elsewhere. These High Arctic water tracks flowed through soils that possessed higher near-surface organic carbon concentrations, higher water content, and coarser material than the surrounding soils. The water track morphology suggested they were initiated by a combination of sorting, differential frost heaving, and eluviation. The resultant network of soil conduits, comparable to soil pipes, dominated the hydrology of the slope. The flow of cold water through these conduits slowed down the progression of the thawing front during summer, making the active layer consistently shallower relative to adjacent soils. Water tracks on Ward Hunt Island, and in polar desert catchments with these features elsewhere in the High Arctic, strongly influence slope hydrology and active-layer properties while also affecting vegetation distribution and the quality of runoff to the downstream lake.

Bacterial alkaline phosphomonoesterase in the rhizospheres of plants grown in Chilean extreme environments	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												Bacterial alkaline phosphomonoesterases (APases) are relevant for organic phosphorus (Po) recycling in many soils. However, the abundance and diversity of bacterial APase in the rhizospheres of native plants are poorly known, particularly in extreme environments. In this research work, we studied the composition of total and APase-harboring bacterial communities, abundances of selected APase genes (phoD and phoX), and APase activities in rhizosphere soils from native plants grown in extreme environments of northern (Atacama Desert), central (Andes volcano; Quetrupillan and Mamuil Malal) and hot spring (Liquie), and southern polar (Patagonia and Antarctic) regions of Chile. Differences in the composition of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere soils were revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), phoD, and phoX genes. In general, the significant lowest bacterial diversities, APase gene abundances, and APase activities were observed in rhizosphere soils from Atacama Desert, whereas the highest values were observed in rhizosphere soils of Patagonia. In addition, APase gene abundances were positively correlated among them and with APase activity of rhizosphere soils, but negatively correlated with phosphorus (P) availability in rhizosphere soils. Although bacterial APases were observed in all studied rhizosphere soils, their relevance to soil Po recycling in soils of extreme environments remains unclear and further studies are needed.					; JORQUERA, MILKO/O-3038-2019; Mora Gil, Maria Luz/AAT-4081-2021; Lagos Pailla, Lorena/IUQ-3815-2023	JORQUERA, MILKO/0000-0003-4760-6379; Acuna, Jacquelinne/0000-0002-7752-166X; Mora, Maria Luz/0000-0002-7474-1595; Duran, Paola/0000-0001-8638-6781; LAGOS PAILLA, LORENA M./0009-0000-6728-435X													0178-2762	1432-0789				AUG	2016	52	6					763	773		10.1007/s00374-016-1113-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-016-1113-9													WOS:000380126600002

In this study, two bacterial strains with the ability to resist high concentrations of arsenic (As) were isolated from water samples from the crater lake. Staphylococcus ARSC1-P and Stenotrophomonas ARSC2-V isolates were identified by use of the 16S rDNA gene. Staphylococcus ARSC1-P was able to grow in 400 mM of arsenate [As(V)] under oxic and anoxic conditions. The IC50 values were 36 and 382 mM for oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively. For its part, Stenotrophomonas ARSC2-V showed IC50 values of 110 mM and 2.15 for As(V) and arsenite [As(III)], respectively. Arsenic accumulated intracellularly in both species [11-25 nmol As x mg cellular prot(-1) in cells cultured in 50 mM As(V)]. The present study shows evidence of microbes that can potentially be a resource for the bio-treatment of arsenic in contaminated sites, which highlights the importance of the "El Chichon" volcano as a source of bacterial strains that are adaptable to extreme conditions.

J	Wang, J; Liu, YJ; Ding, YH				Wang, Jing; Liu, Yanju; Ding, Yihui			Interdecadal relationship between the wintertime haze frequency over Beijing andmega-ENSO	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS												Observational analyses suggest that natural or internal climate variability plays a crucial role in modulating wintertime haze days in Beijing (WHDBJ) on decadal timescales, which may overwhelm the effect of human emissions to some extent. This study links the variations in WHD(BJ)to the mega-El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a newly defined ENSO-related pattern with a vaster range of variability, on decadal timescales. The mega-ENSO delineates an apparent out-of-phase relationship with WHDBJ, which could be used to explain past and recent decreases in WHD(BJ)in 1961-1971 and 1997-2012, as well as the increase in WHD(BJ)in 1972-1996. The positive phase of the mega-ENSO can induce a high dynamical scavenging efficiency of pollutants over the Beijing area through notable in situ low-level northerly wind anomalies that are associated with a quasi-barotropic anticyclonic anomaly centered around Lake Baikal, thus reducing the frequency of haze days on decadal timescales, and vice versa for the negative phase. The mega-ENSO can influence interdecadal predictions of the long-term occurrence of haze events over Beijing. Therefore, it will be focused upon in future routine operations.

J	Kalinowska, K				Kalinowska, Krystyna			Psammon ciliates: diversity and abundance in hygroarenal of eutrophic lake	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Taxonomic composition, spatial distribution and seasonal changes in abundance of ciliates were investigated in hygroarenal (the zone of the beach adjacent to lake littoral and affected by wave action) of the eutrophic Lake Mikolajskie (area 498 ha, max. depth 26 m, Masurian Lake District, Poland). The choosen beach amounted 10.8 x 1.5 m in size and 30 sampling points were distributed according to regular network 60 x 30 cm. Three sampling points were located in each of 10 sampling stations parallel to water line and at an increasing 0, 30, 60 cm distance from it). The small-scale distribution of ciliates was recognized from the set of 30 samples taken once in June 2003 from all stations and sampling points. The seasonal changes of ciliate density were analysed on the set of 41 samples taken from March to November 2004 from the middle sampling points (about 30 cm from water line) in 3 sampling stations. Ciliate community was characterised by relatively high taxonomic richness (56 ciliate taxa) and numbers (up to 2750 ind. cm(-3) of sand). The numbers of ciliates varied seasonally from 4.6 to 1630 ind. per 1 cm(3) of sand, showed three distinct peaks (maximum in summer) and were markedly differentiated among the sampling stations distributed along the 10 m of homogenous beach. Significant correlations between ciliates and the share of largest grain size fraction suggest that grain size of sand may be responsible for the observed spatial heterogeneity of ciliates. Hymenostomes, particularly the omnivorous Pleuronema coronatum Kent, dominated the ciliate assemblages. The statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between ciliate numbers and total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations in interstitial water, but there was no correlation with chlorophyll a.

Annual mean loss rate of nitrogen was 159-229 mg N m-2 d-1 before the loading reduction and 125 mg N mp-2 d-1 after. In spite of a short hydraulic retention time (18-27 days) the proportion of nitrogen loading lost in the lake was high (38-53%) and not affected by changes in loading. Calculated denitrification accounted for 86-93% of the loss rate, while 7-14%. was permanently buried. Marked seasonal variations in the loss percentage were found during the season, ranging from 23% in first quarter to 65% in third quarter. The seasonal variation in the loss percentage of nitrogen showed a hysteresis like relationship to temperature, with a high percentage in fourth quarter. This suggests that the amount of available substrate, which mainly consists of sedimentated phytoplankton, accumulated during summer, is an important regulating factor. The ability of various published input-output models to predict the observed changes in in-lake nitrogen concentration in Lake Sobygard was tested. This study has further confirmed that small lakes with short retention and high nitrogen loading may significantly reduce the nitrogen loading of downstream aquatic environments.

The present contribution discusses and partly revises former schemes of melanopsid dispersal during the Cenozoic, all of which were based on outdated stratigraphic and tectonic concepts as well as an incompletely considered fossil record. Conflating a comprehensive and stratigraphically well-constrained fossil record, modern paleogeographical reconstructions and contemporary climate data, our goal is to present a thorough model of melanopsid distribution and its changes over the Cenozoic as well as its paleogeographical and climatic constraints. The family Melanopsidae evolved about 90 Ma ago in the late Turonian from brackish cerithioidean ancestors. Cretaceous and Paleogene species occur in marginal marine to brackish environments along the shores of the Tethys and Paratethys seas. The extant clades of Melanopsis likely derive from the evolution of freshwater Melanopsis on the Balkan Peninsula back in the late early Miocene. Up to the Pliocene, freshwater species spread toward southwestern and southeastern Europe and successively replaced brackish-water representatives, paralleling a general decline of latter systems during the late Cenozoic. The southwards expansion of Melanopsis and its simultaneous retreat from northern latitudes resulted in the disjunct distribution pattern observed today. The genus Holandriana first appeared in northern Italy in the late early Miocene. The genera Microcolpia and Esperiana both first occurred in the late Miocene and likely derive from brackish-water Melanopsis species native to peri-Paratethyan lakes. The present-day biogeographic isolation of the three latter genera and Melanopsis roots in the climatic deterioration and the disappearance of major lake systems in southeastern Europe. While thermophilous Melanopsis retreated to the warm, dry climates of the Mediterranean and Middle East, Holandriana, Microcolpia and Esperiana adapted to the seasonal, cold-temperate climate of southeastern and eastern Europe and some species became restricted to thermal springs.

Radiocarbon dating of silica sinter deposits in shallow drill cores from the Upper Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												To explore the timing of hydrothermal activity at the Upper Geyser Basin (UGB) in Yellowstone National Park, we obtained seven new accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon C-14 ages of carbonaceous material trapped within siliceous sinter. Five samples came from depths of 15-152 cm within the Y-1 well, and two samples were from well Y-7 (depths of 24 cm and 122 cm). These two wells, at Black Sand and Biscuit Basins, respectively, were drilled in 1967 as part of a scientific drilling program by the U.S. Geological Survey (White et al., 1975). Even with samples as small as 15 g, we obtained sufficient carbonaceous material (a mixture of thermophilic mats, pollen, and charcoal) for the C-14 analyses. Apparent time of deposition ranged from 3775 +/- 25 and 2910 +/- 30 C-14 years BP at the top of the cores to about 8000 years BP at the bottom. The dates are consistent with variable rates of sinter formation at individual sites within the UGB over the Holocene. On a basin-wide scale, though, these and other existing C-14 dates hint that hydrothermal activity at the UGB may have been continuous throughout the Holocene.

Kevin; Wang, Lixia			Hypoxic volume is more responsive than hypoxic area to nutrient load reductions in the northern Gulf of Mexico-and it matters to fish and fisheries	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												While impacts of low oxygen on marine organisms have been reviewed from physiological and ecological perspectives, relating broad population- and ecosystem-level effects to the areal extent of hypoxia (dissolved oxygen concentration below 64 mu M, or 2mg l(-1)) has proven difficult. Wesuggest that hypoxic volume is a more appropriate metric compared to hypoxic area because volume better integrates the effects of hypoxia on ecological processes relevant to many marine taxa. In this paper, we compare the volume-based load responses from a simple biophysical model with results from an independent three-dimensional hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, and discuss the implications with respect to potentially more ecologically-relevant hypoxia management goals. Wealso show that hypoxic volume appears more sensitive than hypoxic area to nutrient load reductions. Model simulations indicate that even under a modest 25% nitrogen load reduction, the thickness of the hypoxic layer in the northern Gulf of Mexico decreases markedly, and hypoxia remains localized to a relatively thin layer near the bottom that most fish and other mobile organisms can more effectively avoid. This finding should be considered when reviewing and potentially setting hypoxia management goals.					; Scavia, Donald/P-5917-2018	Obenour, Daniel/0000-0002-7459-218X; Justic, Dubravko/0000-0003-4843-437X; Scavia, Donald/0000-0002-2784-8269													1748-9326					FEB	2019	14	2							024012	10.1088/1748-9326/aaf938	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf938													WOS:000458135300002

The mechanisms studied included water storage capacity, sedimentation, denitrification, and removal of nutrients by the harvest of macrophytes from ponds and ditches. The results showed that the retention of both water and nutrients depended on the water storage capacity of the ponds, the total pond volume, rainfall, surface runoff, and irrigation amounts. For the years of 1994 and 1995, the water retention rate was 85.5%, while the nutrient retention rate reached 98.1 and 97.8% for total N (TN) and total P (TP), respectively. Sediment deposit was another important mechanism. The average sedimentation rate was 30.0 mm yr(-1) (from 1985-1995). For the whole multipond system (35 ha), the average retention amounts reached 9800 kg of N and 2800 kg of P by sediment accumulation per year. The results demonstrated that denitrification in ponds and ditches was an important mechanism for removing N from the watershed. The highest possible rate was more than 0.17 mg N g(-1) soil during the summer season. The results suggested that the multipond system, which kept water in balance, benefited the water, nutrient, and sediment recycling in the terrestrial ecosystem, as web as helped to reduce agricultural nonpoint pollution at its sources. Therefore, the multipond system, with its low cost in construction and maintenance, is recommended as a good practice both for the control of nonpoint pollution at its sources and for sustainable agricultural development.

Consideration of the complex interactions at the base of the food web, particularly the ability of nanoplankton to graze on picoplankton, helped to resolve the question of phosphate uptake by bacteria versus algae. While the concentration of phosphate we estimated with column chromatography was lower than chemical detection limits, it was still too high to reconcile with our other measurements and we conclude that actual phosphate concentrations may be less than 1 nM. Some microplankton were shown to liberate dissolved phosphate and organic phosphorus when lake water is filtered. The phosphorus content and turnover of major ciliate, rotifer, and crustacean zooplankton were determined and the importance of these compartments as phosphorus sources and sinks was included in the epilimnetic model.

To estimate a potential risk for waterborne infections caused by faecal contamination of drinking water sources, knowledge of the pathogen concentrations in raw water is required. We suggest a novel approach to estimate pathogen concentrations in a drinking water source by using microbial source tracking data and fate and transport modelling. First, the pathogen (norovirus, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli O157/H7) concentrations in faecal contamination sources around the drinking water source Lake Radasjon in Sweden were estimated for endemic and epidemic conditions using measured concentrations of faecal indicators (E. coli and Bacteroidales genetic markers). Afterwards, the fate and transport of pathogens within the lake were simulated using a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and microbiological model. This approach provided information on the contribution from different contamination sources to the pathogen concentrations at the water intake of a drinking water treatment plant. This approach addresses the limitations of monitoring and provides data for quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and risk management in the context of faecal contamination of surface drinking water sources.

Remote Microwave Soil Drought Index Considering Dielectric Properties of Soil	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												The article presents the innovative remote microwave soil drought index (RMSDI) developed for assessing intensity of soil drought (SD) and tested in the Kulunda arid steppe (West Siberia). RMSDI is based on satellite measurements of brightness and thermodynamic temperatures, including dependences of radio-emissivity on volume fraction of water (W) in soil calculated from soil dielectric characteristics. To define W and RMSDI, we employ the data on brightness temperatures obtained from soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) and thermodynamic temperatures-from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The territories falling within a SMOS pixel are major objects of our study (cell 4 010 458 discrete geodetic grid (DGG) icosahedral Snyder equal area (ISEA) 4H9). According to the MODIS data, the lakes and water source areas in a SMOS pixel makes up less than 0.1%. The total area of forest and water sources is insignificant (less than 0.1%). By granulometric composition, soils are referred to slit loam and loam ones. We offer the constructed for the test area graphs of seasonal dynamics of brightness and thermodynamic temperatures, radio-emissivity (chi), W, and RMSDI. Dependences of W (chi ) are given for soils with different values of bound water (W-t). The established standardized dependence chi(t)(W-t) makes it possible to express the value of chi(t) via Wt. The satellite sensing data and dielectric characteristics of soils are used to calculate the values of W and RMSDI.

J	Kauppila, T; Moisio, T; Salonen, VP				Kauppila, T; Moisio, T; Salonen, VP			A diatom-based inference model for autumn epilimnetic total phosphorus concentration and its application to a presently eutrophic boreal lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A diatom transfer function to infer epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) concentration was derived using surface sediment diatom data from 68 medium-sized (10-1000 ha) lakes in Southern Finland. Publicly available monitoring records were used in lake selection to avoid gradients caused by pH and humic substances. Constrained and partially constrained ordinations indicated that TP was an important variable influencing diatom assemblages. A long floristic gradient in relation to TP was also apparent and therefore an inference model was developed for TP using unimodal-based regression and calibration methods. The final model included 61 lakes with epilimnetic TP concentrations between 3 and 89 mug P l(-1), measured during the autumnal circulation period. It has a jackknifed-estimated root mean squared error of prediction of 0.16 log mug P l(-1), a maximum bias of 0.28 log mug P l(-1), and an r(j)(2)ack of 0.76. The model was tested in the presently eutrophic Lake Valkjarvi (epilimnetic [TP] 60-85 mug P l(-1)), located in Southern Finland. It successfully predicted the measured autumnal epilimnetic TP concentration for the past twenty years and the changes in inferred [TP] reflected disturbances known to have occurred before that time. The diatom-based inferences show that Lake Valkjarvi was oligo-mesotrophic as late as the 1930's and has become eutrophic because of nutrient inputs from agriculture and, especially, municipalities. However, epilimnetic TP concentration has not increased further.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2002	27	2					261	273		10.1023/A:1014281817358	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014281817358													WOS:000173990500008
J	Sipponen, M				Sipponen, M			The impact of ownership of fishing rights on professional fishing in Finnish lakes	FISHERIES RESEARCH												In Finland, most of inland water areas are either private or state-owned. Most private waters are owned by a shareholders' association for areas held in common by a registered village, represented by a fishing co-operative. This kind of joint possession of private waters is a feature in Finnish legislation that distinguishes fisheries management from elsewhere in Europe, except Sweden. State-owned waters are managed by fisheries region management units as regards public waters, or their management is handed over to a state-owned enterprise. Due to mosaic ownership many fishermen utilise simultaneously private and state-owned waters, termed here combined waters. The aim of this study, which involved 53 out of a total of 225 fishermen active in 1990, was to examine how the type of water ownership affected professional fishing practices. The data were collected through personal interviews. On the basis of the fishermen's behaviour in response to diminishing fish stocks they have been classified into four groups. Efforts were made to determine whether the pattern of ownership influenced the process of adaptation. Vendace (Coregonus albula L.) is the most important commercial species in Finnish inland waters. State-ownership facilitates the starting up of professional fishing enterprises, providing for equality in obtaining fishing licences, use of the most effective fishing technology, trawling, and highest turnover. The joint possession of private waters in fishing co-operatives results in conservative decision-making and encourages the use of less efficient gear, winter seine. In waters of fishing co-operatives, fishing rights are allocated between shareholders not as dependent on fishery income as fishermen using state-owned waters. The average annual catch per enterprise in winter seining was half of that of trawling. Restrictive policy in fishing co-operative waters results in biological under-utilization of vendace resources, because effective fishing is considered as being the best way of managing vendace stocks. The most prominent distinctive feature of these types of ownership was the attitude to entrepreneurship, which was hampered in privately owned waters. All fishermen expressing a passive form of 'adaptation' to diminishing fish stocks fished in waters belonging entirely or partly to fishing co-operatives.

J	Pisharody, L; Suresh, S; Mukherji, S				Pisharody, Lakshmi; Suresh, Sumathi; Mukherji, Suparna			Development and evaluation of DEAE silica gel columns for simultaneous concentration of coliphages and rotavirus from natural water samples	WATER RESEARCH												Enteric viruses are commonly present in water bodies in regions with poor sanitation. Although the occurrence of these viruses poses a health risk they are difficult to quantify due to their low concentration and they may remain undetected in the absence of adequate preconcentration. The present study reports the synthesis and utilization of DEAE silica gel (DSiG) as an adsorbent for virus concentration. Two coliphages, MS2 and SUSP2, and an enteric virus, mtavirus A (RVA) were chosen for examining the preconcentration efficiency of DSiG columns. Studies conducted at a low flow rate of 5 mL/min yielded good removal of viruses through adsorption. Studies at a higher flow rate of 50 mL/min followed by elution with optimized eluents yielded a high recovery of MS2 and RVA even when they were present at low concentration (0.01 copy/mL). The eluent Na(1.5 M)-Tw(2%)-G3X (glycine 3X broth, 1.5 M NaCl, 2% Tween, pH 10.2) showed maximum elution of RVA and M52. Optimal SUSP2 recovery was observed on employing an eluent composed of 1.5 M NaCl, 3% Tween, 0.05 M KH2PO4 at pH 9.2. Subsequently, both the eluents were successively applied for elution of the adsorbed viruses. This method was applied for virus preconcentration from lake water in the monsoon and winter seasons. The DSiG column could achieve adequate preconcentration for all the three viruses, i.e., SUSP2, MS2, and RVA, even when they were present at very low concentration and the recovery achieved was comparable to that achieved with ultracentrifugation while the processing time required for handling large volumes of water was considerably lower.

Measurements included 6 composition ratios (P/C, N/C, N/P, ATP/C, chlorophyll a/C and protein/carbohydrate) and 3 metabolic indicators (alkaline phosphatase activity and P and N debts expressed per unit particulate ATP). P deficiency is generally greater than N deficiency in all the small lakes studied, embracing a wide range of maximum chlorophyll concentrations and N/P loading ratios. In 2 larger, very turbid lakes, neither P nor N deficiency appeared important, and light limitation is suggested. In a series of lakes of known N and P loading rates, indicators of P deficiency increased but those of N deficiency showed little trend with increasing N/P loading ratio. Some indicators of P deficiency may provide a sensitive means of following the movement of river water, and loss of P from it, through a large lake. Some comparisons of net phytoplankton with total seston showed surprisingly little interference from detritus in these measurements.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	3					442	453		10.1139/f80-058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-058													WOS:A1980JJ97200015

As a consequence of the flood, the physical and chemical environment of the phytoplankton was found to have undergone a change which resulted in an alteration in the composition of the phytoplankton community. The phytoplankton community existing previous to the flood event, which had been dominated by Tabellaria fenestrata sensu Husted 1930 (K-strategist), was replaced by a biocoenosis characterized mainly by various species of flagellates, which represent a typical spring successional stage (r-strategists). After the externally-imposed perturbation, the return to stable physical and chemical conditions was followed by the re-establishment of the successional stage which had existed before the flood (termed "reversion" by Reynolds, 1980).																			1015-1621	1420-9055					1990	52	4					330	344		10.1007/BF00879761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00879761													WOS:A1990EM06600003
J	Raudsepp, U; Kouts, T				Raudsepp, U; Kouts, T			Observations of near-bottom currents in the Gulf of Riga, Baltic Sea	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Near-bottom currents and temperature were measured at 2 and 4 m above bottom (m.a.b.) in the Gulf of Riga, a semi-enclosed sub basin of the Baltic Sea, Measurements were taken during three periods of different vertical stratification and weather conditions. Water depth was 54 meters. The studied area comprised the outer region of the bottom boundary layer, as judged by the observed Ekman veering of the current vector. Local wind was the primary driving force of near-bottom currents in the deepest area of the Gulf of Riga. Imposed wind stress induced surface-layer flow to the right, while compensating return flow developed in the bottom boundary layer. The response of current field was dominated by low-frequency variability with a clear indication of topographic steering and minor variability due to near-inertial frequency processes. The near-inertial frequency processes were generated also by interaction of low-frequency waves with the topography. The low-frequency and near-inertial frequency processes were of equal value in producing vertical shear of horizontal velocity in the near-bottom layer. The quasi-steady flow in autumn was forced by strong net inflow to the Gulf of Riga through the Irbe Strait. Lateral advection of water is important for the deep-water renewal that is due to dominating low-frequency currents.

J	Gunnarson, BE				Gunnarson, Bjorn E.			Temporal distribution pattern of subfossil pines in central Sweden: perspective on Holocene humidity fluctuations	HOLOCENE												The temporal variations in distribution pattern of Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) have been used as an annual resolution record of past lake-level changes. Logs, preserved for thousands of years in bog and lakes (subfossil wood), were sampled from small lakes of the Scandinavian Mountains in west-central Sweden to construct a tree-ring chronology from an area where pines are sensitive to growth season (ie, summer) temperature. The chronology spans from AD 2006 to 4868 BC, with two minor gaps at 1600 BC and AD 900 and one larger gap at 2900 BC. The dendrochronological approach can provide a high quality long-term perspective on lake level fluctuations, which possibly can be coupled to changes in humidity. Submerged trunks were found in situ, embedded in sediments, and because trees from the earliest periods were not necessarily found at the deepest levels, this shows clearly that lake levels must have been lower than present at the time of tree-growth. The lake levels must have fluctuated, creating alternating conditions of pine regeneration and mortality. The fluctuating lake levels recorded are suggested to be a result of regional humidity increases and decreases, mainly governed by precipitation changes. Periods of lower lake levels were inferred at 4900-4800 BC, 3800-3600 BC, 3400-3250 BC, 2400-2200 BC, 2100-1800 BC, 1500-1100 BC, 900-800 BC, 400-100 BC, AD 50-300, AD 400-600, AD 900-1100, AD 1350-1500 and AD 1700-1800. Periods of higher lake levels are tentatively encountered at 3600-3400 BC, 3200-2900 BC, 2200-2100 BC, 1700-1500 BC, 1100-900 BC, 800-400 BC, 100 BC-AD 50, AD 300-400, AD 750-900, AD 1100-1250 and AD 1550-1700.

J	Fernández, P; Grimalt, JO; Vilanova, RM				Fernández, P; Grimalt, JO; Vilanova, RM			Atmospheric gas-particle partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in high mountain regions of Europe	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Atmospheric concentrations and gas-particle partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) have been determined at three remote mountain areas in Europe. Gas-phase mean concentrations of total PAH (20 individual compounds) were very similar at all sites, ranging from 1.3-2.6 ng m(-3) in the Pyrenees (Spain) to 2.7-3.7 ng m(-3) in the Alps (Austria) and Caledonian mountains (Norway). A seasonal variability was observed, with the highest levels found in winter. The seasonal differences were reflected better in the particle-associated PAH, showing the increase of PAH emissions in the colder months and a temperature dependence of the gas-particle partitioning. Significant geographical differences were also observed for particulate PAH, indicating a greater influence of regional sources than in the gas phase. Partitioning of PAH between gas and particulate phases was well-correlated with the subcooled liquid vapor pressure in all samples, but with slopes significantly steeper than the expected value of -1. These steeper slopes may reflect the occurrence of a nonexchangeable PAH fraction in the aerosols, likely associated to the soot carbon phase. Comparison of absorption to organic matter and soot carbon using the octanol-air (K-oa) and soot-air (K-sa) partitioning coefficients shows that, despite uncertainties on estimated organic matter and soot carbon contents in the sampled aerosols, K-oa underpredicts aerosol PAH concentrations by a factor of 0.6-2 log units.

Conceptual Design of an Inflatable-Winged Aircraft for the Exploration of Titan	AIAA AVIATION 2020 FORUM					AIAA Aviation Forum	JUN 15-19, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	AIAA				The Saturnian moon Titan is one of the most intriguing exploration targets in the Solar System, possessing a thick atmosphere and surface lakes of organic chemicals replete with hydrocarbons. In 2018, Oklahoma State University presented the Never-EVER Land (NEL), a concept for a folding rigid wing design to fly a long endurance missions on Titan to analyze its atmosphere and geography. Given ideal conditions, it was projected to fly for 2 to 3 years before gliding into a lake or flat surface on the surface. As a part of the USRI Engineering Development Program, we propose the Never-EVER Land 2 (NEL2), a conceptual aircraft design based on the original Never-EVER Land aircraft, but centered around using inflatable wings to minimize stowage volume during interplanetary transport and the reentry phase of the mission. This paper presents the revised NEL concept and the design and evaluation process for preliminary inflatable wing prototypes through a high school summer internship program.

J	SWEET, MS; PERDUE, EM				SWEET, MS; PERDUE, EM			CONCENTRATION AND SPECIATION OF DISSOLVED SUGARS IN RIVER WATER	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Gas chromatographic analyses of the alditol acetate derivatives of selected pentoses and hexoses were used to determine dissolved (< 0.45 .mu.m) sugars in the Williamson River, Oregon [USA]. Total dissolved sugar concentrations varied from 0.0 to 7.7 .mu.mol/l, with pentoses constituting .apprx. 50% of identified sugars. The lower concentrations were found in spring waters while the higher values were associated with highly colored samples from Klamath Marsh and downstream sampling sites on the Williamson River. The dissolved sugars accounted for an average 2.0% of total organic C in this river system. A fractionation scheme, utilizing XAD-7 resin to adsorb humic substances, was developed to determine the distribution of each sugar among monosaccharide (MS), polysaccharide (PS) and humic-bound saccharide (HS) fractions. Monosaccharides averaged 2.6% of dissolved sugars. The PS/HS ratio, which was much higher in lake and marsh samples than in stream samples, may be indicative of the relative contributions of autochthonous sources of dissolved sugars in the Williamson River system.																			0013-936X	1520-5851					1982	16	10					692	698		10.1021/es00104a011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00104a011													WOS:A1982PJ47600015
J	Schroers, M; Martin, E				Schroers, Melanie; Martin, Elinor			Synoptic Connections and Impacts of 14-Day Extreme Precipitation Events in the United States	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Long periods of extreme precipitation can cause costly damages to a region's infrastructure while also creating a higher risk for the region's population. Planning for these periods would ideally begin at the subseasonal-to-seasonal time scale, yet prediction of precipitation at this time scale has low skill. In this study, we will use Jennrich et al.'s database of 14-day extreme precipitation events to understand more about the synoptic connections and impacts of these extended extreme events. The synoptic connections of events were examined using the composites of event-day 500-hPa geopotential height and precipitable water anomalies. The combination of these two drivers leads to higher skill in the West Coast and Great Lakes than other regions, with an equitable threat score of 0.137 and 0.084, respectively, and higher conditional probabilities of event occurrence. Therefore, the synoptic patterns associated with events, although significant, are not unique, which poses prediction challenges. Historical impacts of these events, using NCEI storm reports, were assessed to benefit decision-makers in future risk mitigation. A variety of reports were found during events, from winter weather reports in West Coast events to tropical storm reports in Southeast events. Every region has significantly more flooding reports during events than in nonextreme 14-day periods, demonstrating the impacts of such extended events. Although there is still much to learn about extreme precipitation events, this study contributes to the foundational knowledge of synoptic drivers and impacts of events.

Impact of the Development of Hydrocarbon Deposits on Water Ecosystems of the Yamal Peninsula	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Data of monitoring studies (2014-2016) on the state of hydrobionts in watercourses during the development of a hydrocarbon deposit on the Yamal Peninsula have been analyzed. The increased content of suspended solids has the greatest effect on hydrobionts. While the background values of concentration of suspended solids is 4-6 mg/L, in the area of the entrance of the pit effluents to the watercourses, their concentration increases up to 440 mg/L and higher. The effect of increased turbidity on the qualitative and quantitative indicators of planktonic organisms has not been found. An increase of suspended solids in water has a negative effect on zoobenthos (r(Sp) = -0.426, p = 0.030 for the number of species; r(Sp) = -0.590, p = 0.002 for the abundance; r(Sp) = -0.480, p = 0.013 for the biomass) and fish (r(Sp) = -0.567, p = 0.004 for ecological density of small fish species). Especially sensitive fish to the increased content of suspended solids are whitefishes and lake minnows. The most tolerant to turbidity are the nine-spined stickleback and Barbatula toni. Increased concentrations of suspended solids in autumn are the reason for the cessation of up-stream migration of whitefishes from the Gulf of Ob to the deep lakes.

Late Holocene forest dynamics, volcanism, and climate change at Whitewing Mountain and San Joaquin Ridge, Mono County, Sierra Nevada, CA, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Deadwood tree stems scattered above treeline on tephra-covered slopes of Whitewing Mtn (3051 in) and San Joaquin Ridge (3122 in) show evidence of being killed in an eruption from adjacent Glass Creek Vent, Inyo Craters. Using tree-ring methods, we dated deadwood to AD 8151350 and infer from death dates that the eruption occurred in late summer AD 1350. Based on wood anatomy, we identified deadwood species as Pinus albicaulis, R monticola, P lambertiana, R contorta, R jeffreyi, and Tsuga mertensiana. Only P albicaulis grows at these elevations currently; P lambertiana is not locally native. Using contemporary distributions of the species, we modeled paleoclimate during the time of sympatry to be significantly warmer (+3.2 degrees C annual minimum temperature) and slightly drier (-24 mm annual precipitation) than present, resembling values projected for California in the next 70-100 yr.

The Differential Back Trajectory (DBT) method compares mean differences between ozone concentrations associated with fire-affected and fire-unaffected parcels. It is applied to more than 1100 ozonesonde profiles collected from these sites during the summer months June to August 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2011. Layers of high ozone associated with low humidity were first removed from the ozonesonde profiles to minimize the potential effects of stratospheric intrusions on the calculations. No significant influence on average ozone levels by North American fires was found for stations located at Arctic latitudes. The ozone enhancement for stations nearer large fires, such as Trinidad Head and Bratt's Lake, was up to 4.8% of the TTOC (Total Tropospheric Ozone Column). Fire ozone accounted for up to 8.3% of TTOC at downwind sites such as Yarmouth, Sable Island, Narragansett, and Walsingham. The results are consistent with other studies that have reported an increase in ozone production with the age of the smoke plume.

The effect of these lakes on local temperatures is unclear. In this study, the effects of the lakes were investigated using land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data from 2003 to 2018 and air temperatures from meteorological stations in 2017. LST and air temperatures are compared between the lake-group region and an area without lakes to the north using statistical methods. Our results show that the lake-group region is found to exhibit a warm island effect in winter on an annual scale and at night on a daily scale. The warm island effect is caused by the differing properties of the land and other surfaces. Groundwater may also be an important heat source. The results of this study will help in understanding the causative factors of warm island effects and other properties of lakes.

The development of new mining reservoirs may give a unique opportunity to study the early stages of colonization by various freshwater communities, including phytoplankton. Our paper presents the results of phycological research undertaken in newly formed subsidence reservoir near the coal mine "Bogdanka" (Polesie Lubelskie) a few months after its filling with water. The reservoir represented a unique, rare limnologic type due to the fact that it disappeared as a result of intended melioration works in the autumn of the same year. The study focused on morphometric measurements of the episodic reservoir, determination of general physicochemical parameters of water, and qualitative and quantitative structure of the phytoplankton community, was undertaken in five separated basins. A total of 80 algal taxa were determined. Most of them belonged to euglenoids (Euglenophyta-36) and green algae (Chlorophyta-26). Among euglenoids, most species were represented by Trachelomonas genus (14), while among green algae, most species were assigned to Scenedesmus genus (8). Several rare species were found, including: Scenedesmus bacillaris Gutw., Dinobryon petiolatum Willen, and Trachelomonas botanica Playfair. Green algae and euglenoids also had major contributions to the total phytoplankton abundance, which in all study sites did not exceed 2.2x10(6) ind.-dm(-3). This phytoplankton structure was probably influenced by the high water color related to particular and dissolved organic matter from pre-existing alder forests. Some differences in phytoplankton structure found among sampling sites were probably connected with habitat differentiation in terms of exposure to light.

During the peak water bloom periods Microcystis aeruginosa was found to be the dominants phytoplankton present. M. aeruginosa was found to be lethally toxic by the mouse bioassay in nineteen of the twenty-six samples collected. Toxicity was of the type previously reported for hepatotoxic cyclic peptides of M. aeruginosa and other freshwater bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Toxicity as measured by the intraperitoneal mouse assay varied considerably between and within sample locations. One major toxin was isolated from each of three samples. One toxin was analyzed by HPLC and amino acid analysis. It had similar characteristics as the cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxin isolated from field and laboratory M. aeruginosa examined from N.

Automated Coastal Ice Mapping with SAR Can Inform Winter Fish Ecology in the Laurentian Great Lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Many freshwater lakes in the temperate zone undergo annual freeze-thaw cycles. Climate change has disrupted these patterns and altered habitat for many species including ecologically, economically, and culturally valuable fish species. To understand the relationship between ice cover and aquatic species, suitable data can be derived from remote sensing. We developed a novel ice classification method with minimal user input using freely available Sentinel-1 data and an adjacent and time-coincident validation dataset. Using image object segmentation and a random forest classifier, ice conditions were classified correctly with >85% overall accuracy. Our ice mapping efforts coincided with a telemetry dataset of tagged Walleye (Sander vitreus) and Northern Pike (Esox lucius) in Hamilton Harbor in western Lake Ontario. Between years with low and high ice covers (2017 and 2019, respectively), we found Walleye appeared to reduce their area of movement when the harbor was covered in ice. Our ice mapping tool can provide a quick and consistent method for agencies to adopt for freshwater resource management as well as provide ice cover information in coastal areas that are important overwintering habitat for many fishes.

This paper proposed a novel method according to the idea of multiple time scales to verify ecological restoration policies in the Shiyang River drainage basin, arid China. We integrated modern pollen transport characteristics of the entire basin and pollen records from 8 Holocene sedimentary sections, and quantitatively reconstructed the millennial-scale changes of watershed vegetation zones by defining a new pollen-precipitation index. Meanwhile, Empirical Orthogonal Function method was used to quantitatively analyze spatial and temporal variations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in summer (June to August) of 2000-2014. By contrasting the vegetation changes that mainly controlled by millennial-scale natural ecological evolution with that under conditions of modern ecological restoration measures, we found that vegetation changes of the entire Shiyang River drainage basin are synchronous in both two time scales, and the current ecological restoration policies met the requirements of long-term restoration objectives and showed promising early results on ecological environmental restoration. Our findings present an innovative method to verify river ecological restoration policies, and also provide the scientific basis to propose future emphasizes of ecological restoration strategies.

J	Alekseev, VR				Alekseev, Victor R.			Confusing Invader: Acanthocyclops americanus (Copepoda: Cyclopoida) and Its Biological, Anthropogenic and Climate-Dependent Mechanisms of Rapid Distribution in Eurasia	WATER												Acanthocyclops americanus (Marsh, 1892), first described in Wisconsin (USA), was discovered shortly thereafter in Great Britain and then widely distributed in the Palearctic. Its current range includes Europe, North Africa, western and central Siberia with the largest number of findings along the migration tracks of aquatic birds. Until recently, the northern border was the 60th parallel, but in the last decade it has expanded further into the Arctic. The most rapid expansion of its range in Europe happened in the middle of the last century, which was partially hidden from scientists due to a taxonomic mistake caused by the merging of its name with the native Palearctic form Acanthocyclops robustus (Sars, 1863). This problem was solved only recently with the help of molecular genetic tools, allowing a return to the study of biological, anthropogenic and possible climate-dependent mechanisms of the successful rapid invasion of A. americanus into the Palearctic. This paper, along with a detailed description of the life cycle parameters, adaptive behavior of nauplii and population dynamics in Acanthocyclops americanus compared to those in two other native Acanthocyclops species (Acanthocyclops vernalis and A. robustus), provides a possible history of the biological invasion of A. americanus in the Palearctic. Special attention is paid to the climate-dependent mechanism of the expansion of its range into the north and far east of Asia. The introduction of the A.americanus into small lakes in Great Britain resulted in the dominance of this species in the summer plankton. In many high-trophic reservoirs in Belgium, France and Spain, as well as in newly built reservoirs in Europe, this species has become the only representative of crustacean zooplankton in the warm season. This has led to a significant transformation of the trophic webs of these reservoirs. The rapid dispersal of the invasive species, which was demonstrated by A. americanus in the last century, can make it difficult, and in some cases even impossible to study the historical reasons for the formation of the fauna of other invertebrates associated with such events including the movement of continents and the evolution of the Tethys Sea.					alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609														2073-4441				MAY	2021	13	10							1423	10.3390/w13101423	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13101423													WOS:000655152500001

Observations from 46 lakes revealed that annually averaged surface temperatures increased by + 0.5 degrees C between 1990 and 2020 while bottom temperatures remained almost constant. Modelling of 12 lakes predicted further increases in surface temperatures by 0.3 degrees C/decade until the year 2099 in the most pessimistic emission scenario RCP 8.5 (RCP 4.5: + 0.18 degrees C/decade; RCP 2.6: + 0.04 degrees C/decade). Again, bottom temperatures increased much less while summer stratification extended by up to 38 days. Using a simplified oxygen model, we showed that hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations decreased by 0.7-1.9 mg L-1 in response to the extended stratification period. However, model runs assuming lower productivity (e. g. through nutrient reduction) resulted in increased oxygen concentrations even in the most pessimistic emission scenario. Our results suggest that the negative effects of climate change on the oxygen budget of lakes can be efficiently mitigated by nutrient control.

P, light (E), and N limited the growth rate of the population at different times of year: E and P limitation, alternately during Jan., Feb., and March; P limitation during April and May; N followed by E limitation in June; N limitation in July until mid-Aug., followed by P limitation until Oct; E limitation in Oct., Nov., and Dec. In winter, an effect of temperature on the phytoplankton growth could not be excluded. Internal nutrient and pigment contents cannot be used as physiological indicators without prior knowledge of the growth rates and light conditions in nature. Similarly, N:P ratios (internal or external) are not reliable indicators of N- or P-limited phytoplankton growth. Nutrient uptake capacity values (Vmax) are useful in assessing factors that limit growth rates in nature.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	1					39	52		10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0039	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0039													WOS:A1982NA27100004

The first step in the process was to adapt the model for use in a large and complex Swedish catchment. We focused on the Galten basin with four rivers draining into the western region of Malaren. The catchment model was calibrated and tested using long-term historical data for river discharge and dissolved nutrients (N, P). Then multiple regional climate model simulation results were downscaled to the local catchment level, and used to simulate possible hydrological and nutrient loading responses to warmer world scenarios. Climate change projections for the rivers of Galten basin show profound changes in the timing of discharge and nutrient delivery due to increased winter precipitation and earlier snow melt. Impacts on total annual discharge and load are minimal, but the alteration in river flow regime and the timing of nutrient delivery for future climate scenarios is strikingly different from historical conditions.

J	Hornák, K; Pernthaler, J				Hornak, Karel; Pernthaler, Jakob			Homeostatic regulation of dissolved labile organic substrates by consumption and release processes in a freshwater lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined short-term changes and spatial variability of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) and glucose in mesotrophic Lake Zurich (Switzerland) at 2- to 4-day intervals over 5 weeks during spring. Heterotrophic incorporation, consumption ("gross" uptake), and release of free leucine and glucose were assessed using isotopically labeled tracers. Glucose exhibited significantly higher consumption and release rates but a lower turnover time than leucine. The net uptake, release, and turnover time of both substrates were significantly correlated, suggesting that their microbial processing was closely coupled. Net changes of individual DFAA and glucose during dark short-term incubations with unfiltered samples including phytoplankton were conspicuously similar, indicating that bulk heterotrophic consumption of labile substrates was nonselective and depended primarily on their availability. Changes of DFAA during incubations were significantly related to their initial concentrations. Specifically, DFAA concentrations tended to converge toward their seasonal in situ median concentrations, which likely represented the balanced state of net release vs. consumption. There was a clear difference between relatively stable compounds (glucose, leucine, arginine) and others that showed pronounced concentration changes during incubations (alanine, valine, glycine), pointing to a variable degree of uncoupling between consumption and release. Moreover, short-term changes of DFAA concentrations in incubations were also related to their variability in replicate 5-liter samples taken from the lake, suggesting that biological processes such as consumption and release may influence the mesoscale spatial distribution of DFAA in the epilimnion of a lake. Overall, we document the homeostatic regulation of labile dissolved substrates by varying release and consumption processes.					; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2020	65	5					939	950		10.1002/lno.11360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11360		NOV 2019											WOS:000496613200001

The objectives are to predict the spatial occurrence pattern and to identify the environmental variables that describe the occurrence. Our model combines a non-linear predictor with a spatial random effect and we show how to treat both of them under the Gaussian process framework. We propose also a pragmatic procedure to detect the most relevant environmental variables in prediction using average predictive comparisons. We conduct a fully Bayesian inference and evaluate our model in an interpolation and extrapolation tasks. The results show that the goodness of the model depends on the covariance function of the Gaussian process. The proposed methods are applied for a case study with the youngest stages of sea spawning whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L s.l.) larvae in the Gulf of Bothnia. Results on the case study show that in large scale the most important variables describing the potential larval areas are bottom type, prolonged ice period in spring, ecological status of coastal areas, distance to large shallow sand areas and water depth.

Long-term water quality changes in a multiple-stressor system: a diatom-based paleolimnological study of Lake Simcoe (Ontario, Canada)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Diatom-based paleolimnological techniques were used to assess long-term changes in the water quality of Lake Simcoe (Ontario, Canada) using Pb-210-dated sediment cores from four sites across the lake. Modest lake-wide shifts in diatom community composition occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, suggesting that early cultural disturbances (e. g., land clearance and canal construction) had relatively minor effects on Lake Simcoe water quality. However, starting in the 1930s, phosphorus loading to the lake increased, which was closely tracked by increases in diatom taxa indicative of eutrophic conditions. The most pronounced lake-wide shift in diatom assemblages occurred in the mid-to late 20th century, the nature and timing of which strongly suggested a response to regional climate warming. An additional and marked lake-wide shift in diatom assemblages occurred in the mid-1990s, coinciding with the invasion of dreissenid mussels in Lake Simcoe. Our results indicate that Lake Simcoe water quality has been affected by the interaction of numerous environmental stressors over the past two centuries, the complexity of which has been amplified by recent warming.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2012	69	1					24	40		10.1139/F2011-134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F2011-134													WOS:000299790400003

Despite their widespread distribution, the transfer patterns and impacts of MPs in remote lakes remain poorly understood. This study aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding the pathways and consequences of MP pollution in these isolated environments. Focusing on Ky & ecirc;bxang Co, a remote salt lake in Tibet, this study investigated the transfer patterns, sources and ecological impacts of MPs, providing insights into their mobility and fate in pristine ecosystems. Water, sediment and biota (brine shrimp) samples from Ky & ecirc;bxang Co, collected during the summer of 2020, were analyzed using mu -Raman spectroscopy to determine MP abundances, polymer types and potential sources. Findings indicated significant MP contamination in all examined media, with concentrations highlighting the role of runoff in transporting MPs to remote locations. The majority of detected MPs were small fragments (<0.5 mm), constituting over 93 %, with polypropylene being the predominant polymer type. The presence of a halocline may slow the descent of MPs, potentially increasing the exposure and ingestion risk to brine shrimp. Despite the currently low ecological risk estimated for MPs, this study underscores the need for long-term monitoring and development of a comprehensive ecological risk assessment model for MPs.

(MENYANTHACEAE)	AQUATIC BOTANY												In 1980, the seasonal changes in N and P concentration of various plant parts of N. peltata (Gmel.) O. Kuntze, together with aspects of N and P cycling by this species were studied in an oxbow lake of the river Waal (The Netherlands). The N and P stores of the water, seston, sediment and macrophyte compartments were assessed each month. The underground Nymphoides structures had high N and P concentrations before and after the main growing season, while the above-ground plant parts had high nutrient contents during summer. N. peltata accumulated maximum amounts of N (334 mmol m-2) and P (56.6 mmol m-2) in July. The upper layers of the bottom appeared to be an enormous nutrient reservoir (94-99% of total) of which the largest part was not directly available to Nymphoides. Nutrient uptake from the sediments by N. peltata is suggested by the fact that the bottom and/or interstitial water of the sample station, devoid of rooted macrophytes, contained higher concentrations of N and P than that of the Nymphoides stands. The annual flux of nutrients from Nymphoides to the detritus compartment was estimated to be .apprx. 1200 mmol N and 164 mmol P per m2 of littoral. During breakdown of the detritus, there was a relatively fast net conversion of organically bound N and P to inorganic forms, especially at higher temperatures. Nymphoides has the potential to function as an important N and P pump which regenerates sediment nutrients.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1983	17	3-4					189	214		10.1016/0304-3770(83)90057-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(83)90057-8													WOS:A1983SH76200002

Assessment of the water quality of lake plastira through mathematecal modelling for alternative management scenarios	Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A, Oral Presentations	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology				8th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 08-10, 2003	Lemnos Isl, GREECE	Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies, Global NEST				In the context of a research program regarding water quality management and protection plan for Lake Plastira, one of the main tasks was the establishment of a sound relationship between the minimum water level and the trophic state of the lake. The study involves the application of mathematical modelling. The mathematical model used is an eutrophication-dissolved oxygen model (EUTRO-SEL), which has been developed in the Sanitary Engineering Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens and applied to the particular case of Lake Plastira. The mathematical model describes various physical, chemical and biological processes taking place in a water body, through suitable terms in mass balance equations for each chemical biological and physical parameter examined. Three water management scenarios were examined in the context of the study, based on alternative minimal operating water levels. The three alternative scenarios are related to the operation of the lake Plastira at minimum water levels of: a) 782m, b) 784m and c) 786m. The modelling application showed notable differences in the expected maximum annual summer chlorophyll-a concentrations for the three alternative management scenarios. Lower values (0,3-3,6 mu g/l) corresponding to the minimum operating level of 786 m and maximum summer chlorophyll-a concentrations for the 784 m and 782 m scenarios (between 1,0-6,0 mu g/l and 3,2-6,0 mu g/l respectively). According to the results of the mathematical modelling and the classification of the water bodies according to the recent standards and trends within the European Commission, the operation of Lake Plastira at a minimum water level of 786 m ensures very good water quality characteristics, resulting in the classification of the lake to the Category I. The operation of the Lake Plastira at lower water levels between 782-784 m, results in acceptable water quality that classify the lake into Category II. Since in all three management scenarios the water quality is acceptable and describes a water body with at least good water quality, acceptable minimum operational water level, can be determined by other considerations (e.g. elasticity of demand, lanscape aesthetics, etc).

Two hardwater eutrophic lakes of central Alberta were subjected to single doses of Ca(OH)(2) (74 or 107 mg L-1). The effects of lime treatment on phosphorus (P) precipitation, sediment P release, and macrophyte biomass were assessed for up to 2 years. 2. In both lakes, sediment P release was reduced to 16 and 27%, respectively, of pre-treatment values by the first winter following treatment. However, sediment P release returned to pre-treatment values during the following year. 3. In contrast to these short-term effects, macrophyte biomass decreased by as much as 80% after lime application and remained there for at least 2 years. 4. Our results indicate that a single dose of Ca(OH)(2) may give short-term (< 1 year) control of P and long-term control (> 1 year) of macrophytes in hardwater eutrophic lakes of Alberta.																			0046-5070					AUG	2001	46	8					1075	1087		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00790.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00790.x													WOS:000170565800006

However, the origin of these elements and their enrichment mechanisms in those geothermal waters remain unclear. This study presents data for the enriched elements, incompatible elements, and B and Sr isotopes, in the geothermal water in the Tibetan Plateau and compares them with some typical geothermal fields worldwide, in an attempt to provide new insights into the origin and mechanism of the enrichment of these trace elements. The results indicate that all geothermal water samples from the Tibetan Plateau show more negative delta B-11 values than those from local precipitation and rivers. Considering the wide existence of a high-conductivity zone in the middle or even upper-crust interpreted to correspond to re-melt magmatic fluids in the Tibet, the main sources of the typical chemical composition of geothermal waters in the Tibetan Plateau can be classified into two main types: residual magmatic fluids derived from crustal partial remelting and deep circulated groundwater modified by water-rock interactions. In particular, the possible source of magmatic fluids may play a more significant role for special geochemical compositions of geothermal water in the Tibet. Such resources are beneficial for the development and utilization of the geothermal water itself and also serve as a stable source for feeding the salt lake resources.

J	Wiedner, C; Rücker, J; Brüggemann, R; Nixdorf, B				Wiedner, Claudia; Ruecker, Jacqueline; Brueggemann, Rainer; Nixdorf, Brigitte			Climate change affects timing and size of populations of an invasive cyanobacterium in temperate regions	OECOLOGIA												Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, an invasive freshwater cyanobacterium, originated from the tropics but has spread to temperate zones over the last few decades. Its northernmost populations in Europe occur in North German lakes. How such dramatic changes in its biogeography are possible and how its population dynamics in the newly invaded habitats are regulated are still unexplained. We therefore conducted a long-term (1993-2005) study of two German lakes to elucidate the mechanisms behind C. raciborskii population dynamics and to identify the abiotic constraints on its development. Our data revealed that pelagic populations of C. raciborskii thrived for three months during the summer, contributing up to 23% of the total cyanobacteria biovolume. Population sizes varied greatly between years without exhibiting any distinct long-term trends. In the annual lifecycle, C. raciborskii filaments emerged in the pelagic habitat when the temperature rose above 15-17 degrees C. At that time, mean photosynthetically active radiation in the mixed water column (I-mix) overstepped its maximum. Rates of population net increase were highest at the beginning of the season (0.15-0.28 day(-1)), declined continuously over time, and were significantly positively correlated with I-mix. This indicates that the onset of the pelagic population is temperature-mediated and that I-mix controls its growth. Since I-mix peaks before the population onset, the time of germination is of crucial importance for successful development. To test this hypothesis, we designed a model to simulate pelagic population size, starting at different dates in the annual cycle. Moving the population onset forward by 30 days resulted in a doubling of the population size. We therefore conclude that an earlier rise in water temperature associated with climate change has promoted the spread of C. raciborskii to the temperate zone. Earlier warming permits earlier germination, thereby shifting the pelagic populations to a phase with higher I-mix, which advances growth and the population establishment.					; Rücker, Jacqueline/H-8994-2019	Rucker, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6841-7724; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				JUN	2007	152	3					473	484		10.1007/s00442-007-0683-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-007-0683-5								17375336					WOS:000246614700008

Studies of TTG suites worldwide, however, demonstrate that reprocessing of older crust is common. Felsic volcanic and intrusive rocks from the North Caribou Lake area, located in the nucleus of the Superior Province, exhibit a range of compositions that are not accounted for by variable degrees of amphibolite melting alone. Characteristic of Archean TTG, the rocks mainly fall in the lower right hand quadrant of a Nb/Ta vs Zr/Sm plot but they also show clear trends between epsilon Nd-T and ratios such as Al2O3/TiO2, Th/Nb, [Tb/Yb](N) and Eu/Eu*. The lowest Nb/Ta values in the TTG likely result from crystal fractionation including titanite, which strongly partitions and fractionates these elements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Cwynar, LC; Spear, RW				Cwynar, LC; Spear, RW			Lateglacial climate change in the White Mountains of New Hampshire	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Previous paleoecological studies of vegetation change based on pollen and plant macrofossil analyses have shown no evidence of Lateglacial climate reversals in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. We analyzed the carbon content and fossil midge fly assemblages of sediments from one high-elevation and two mid-elevation ponds in order to determine if Lateglacial climate reversals did occur. All three sites provide evidence for a major Lateglacial climate reversal that correlates with the Younger Dryas event (GS-1). A paleotemperature inference model based on fossil midges indicates a decline in maximum summer surface lakewater temperatures of about 5 degreesC. Because this decline is less than that experienced at similar sites in Maritime Canada and Maine, the impact of GS-1 appears to have been attenuated westward from the coast. Changes in organic content also provide evidence for the occurrence of a minor reversal immediately prior to the major one, but the chironomid data are inconclusive. This minor event likely correlates with GI-1b, the Killarney Oscillation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Scharf, W				Scharf, W			Deviations from OECD predictions in softwater reservoirs: Effects of the zooplankton structure	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Measured annual algal biomass deviated widely from predictions made using the OECD model for Shallow Lakes and Reservoirs in two out of the eight soft water reservoirs investigated. From the point of view of water management, it was necessary to understand the reasons why algal biomass in one reservoir was much lower, while in another reservoir it was much higher than predicted. Evidence is provided that zooplankton community composition, especially the proportion of large-sized daphnids and not herbivorous zooplankton biomass, was the key factor in regulating algal growth during the summer season and in influencing annual algal biomass. This became evident because special attention was given to the large sized daphnids: in addition to counting them, a vertical net haud with a 780 mu m mesh was used and particulate organic nitrogen (PON > 780 mu m) was determined in order to assess the share attributable to large sized daphnids. Results suggest PON >780 um estimates as a useful tool for assessing zooplankton community structure. Size-related alterations observed in the composition of the zooplankton communities were due to the impact of planktivorous fishes. Thus, cascading effects in the food chain may account for deviations from the predictions of the OECD-model. For water management of these reservoirs, these results suggest that far greater reductions in algal biomass can be expected than predicted by statistical models, when biomanipulation of the fish stock is used as an additional method of restoration.																			0003-9136					JAN	1997	138	3					381	399																WOS:A1997WJ94300006
J	Pasek, MA; Sampson, JM; Atlas, Z				Pasek, Matthew A.; Sampson, Jacqueline M.; Atlas, Zachary			Redox chemistry in the phosphorus biogeochemical cycle	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The element phosphorus (P) controls growth in many ecosystems as the limiting nutrient, where it is broadly considered to reside as pentavalent P in phosphate minerals and organic esters. Exceptions to pentavalent P include phosphine-PH3-a trace atmospheric gas, and phosphite and hypophosphite, P anions that have been detected recently in lightning strikes, eutrophic lakes, geothermal springs, and termite hindguts. Reduced oxidation state P compounds include the phosphonates, characterized by C-P bonds, which bear up to 25% of total organic dissolved phosphorus. Reduced P compounds have been considered to be rare; however, the microbial ability to use reduced P compounds as sole P sources is ubiquitous. Here we show that between 10% and 20% of dissolved P bears a redox state of less than +5 in water samples from central Florida, on average, with some samples bearing almost as much reduced P as phosphate. If the quantity of reduced P observed in the water samples from Florida studied here is broadly characteristic of similar environments on the global scale, it accounts well for the concentration of atmospheric phosphine and provides a rationale for the ubiquity of phosphite utilization genes in nature. Phosphine is generated at a quantity consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium established by the disproportionation reaction of reduced P species. Comprising 10-20% of the total dissolved P inventory in Florida environments, reduced P compounds could hence be a critical part of the phosphorus biogeochemical cycle, and in turn may impact global carbon cycling and methanogenesis.

In this study we investigated the bed morphology, conductivity and the changes of macro- and microelements in the oxbow, named Kacsa-to, that was formed by the 45th cutoff on Tisza River, then the results were plotted using GIS softwares. Our aim was to examine the specific electric conductivity and its spatial pattern at the end of the spring flood at 2013. We analyzed water samples collected by a stratified sampling system so as to conclude the extent of overturning. The inflow from the flood resulted lower conductivity values at the extensive SE part than at the distant NW part. Initially the fresh water supply from the flood does not reach the distant parts; thus, the overturning takes place more slowly so the water body replacement of the oxbow occurs constantly. Our results show that at the beginning of the flood the oxbow could be divided into two distinct heterogeneous parts. Based on the conductivity values at time of the measurement, we found that the overturning is not yet complete.

Evidence of reduced reproductive success of nesting largemouth bass sampled with standard electrorishing procedures	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Fisheries biologists commonly use electrofishing as a fish collection technique. Because electrofishing is often conducted in the spring, it has the potential to negatively affect the reproductive activities of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, particularly the parental care activities of the nest-guarding males. To assess the effect of electrofishing on nest-guarding activities, we electrofished parental males from their nests in an Illinois lake, held them in a tank for 30 min, and released them 0.25 km from their nest sites-as would be done during routine surveys. We then assessed the presence or absence of broods and males on their nests 24 It later to determine rates of abandonment. Electrofished males had greater levels of nest abandonment (41%; N = 34) than did control males (9.5%; N = 42). The developmental stage of the offspring present in the nest during the electrofishing, however. did not influence abandonment rate. These results suggest that springtime electrofishing can negatively affect the reproductive success of individual largemouth bass and thus may have implications for recruitment.

J	Wu, GC; Wang, KC				Wu, Guocan; Wang, Kaicun			Observed response of precipitation intensity to dew point temperature over the contiguous US	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Precipitation has an important impact on crop growth, water resources, industrial/agricultural production, and ecological services. Compared to widely used precipitation amount, intensity of precipitation is more important because it determines the partition of precipitation into soil moisture and surface runoff. With hourly precipitation observations collected at 307 stations over the contiguous US from 1984 to 2013, this study investigates the sensitivity of precipitation intensity to warming. To deal with the issues of constant relative humidity assumption in the existing studies, the sensitivities of hourly precipitation intensity at various percentiles to dew point temperature are examined. We find that the results with dew point temperature showed more consistent and robust positive sensitivities than that of air temperature. The sensitivity of precipitation intensity to warming of dew point temperature increases from similar to 2%/degrees C for the 50th percentile of precipitation to similar to 6%/degrees C for the 99th percentile of precipitation. These sensitivities are the largest in the Southwest region, followed by the Great Lakes and Plains, the Pacific Coast, and the West region. Such spatial contrast is the largest in summer. The results can provide a comprehensive and quantitative documentation of the precipitation sensitivity to warming.					; Wu, Guocan/AAF-9419-2021; Wang, Kaicun/F-7813-2012	Wu, Guocan/0000-0001-7979-6379; Wang, Kaicun/0000-0002-7414-5400													0177-798X	1434-4483				MAY	2021	144	3-4					1349	1362		10.1007/s00704-021-03602-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-021-03602-3		APR 2021											WOS:000635945400001

Diversity and spatial distribution of autotrophic communities within and between ice-covered Antarctic lakes (McMurdo Dry Valleys)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We compared the spatial distribution and diversity of autotrophic microbial communities among four permanently ice-covered, chemically stratified lakes located in the Taylor (Lakes Bonney-east and west lobes, Fryxell), and Wright (Lake Vanda) Valleys of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Victoria Land, Antarctica). Clone libraries were constructed for major carbon fixation genes (rbcL isoforms IA/B and ID; cbbM; nifJ). Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were also developed for each of these markers of autotrophy to assess the influence of lake physicochemical factors on spatial trends in major photosynthetic and chemolithoautotrophic groups. Both lobes of Lake Bonney were dominated by Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RubisCO) form ID rbcL (haptophytes and stramenopiles), while Lake Fryxell was dominated by rbcL form ID-harboring cryptophytes. Lake Vanda was the least productive lake and was dominated by form IA/B rbcL (cyanobacteria and chlorophytes) and form ID rbcL (stramenopiles). Autotrophic carbon fixation genes from photosynthetic organisms were generally positively correlated with light availability. Chemolithoautotrophic organisms harboring form II RubisCO were detected in only two of the four lakes (west lobe Lake Bonney and Fryxell) and were associated with the presence of either sulfide (Fryxell) or dimethylated sulfur compounds (west lobe Lake Bonney).

MACROPHYTE RICHNESS AND AQUATIC VEGETATION COMPLEXITY OF THE LAKE IDRO (NORTHERN ITALY)	ANNALI DI BOTANICA												A detailed survey was performed to examine the floristic richness, structural complexity, spatial patterns and conservation value of the submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the littoral zone of the Lake Idro (Northern Italy). During the summers 2010 and 2011 the SAV was analyzed with standardized procedures, exploring both transects (44) and plots (49). Lake Idro is characterized by rather high floristic richness (20 macrophyte species) but low levels of the structural complexity of vegetation communities (8 units). A clear zonation of the littoral vegetation was identified with two main macro-layers: a deep layer (between 6-10 m depth) dominated by Chara globularis and a surface layer (from 0 to 6 m depth) mainly colonized by alien elodeids, with the dominance of Elodea nuttallii and Lagarosiphon major. The first complete floristic-vegetation analysis of the Lake Idro evidences the poor ecological status of the littoral zone, even though all the vegetation communities described are of conservation concern. Ongoing investigations will further highlight relationships between eutrophication and macrophyte communities.

Features of Reproduction and Early Development in the Batura Toad (Bufotes baturae, Amphibia, Bufonidae), the Most High-Montaine Amphibian in the Former Soviet Union, Based on the Results of a Laboratory Study	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The Batura toad (Bufotes baturae) is a triploid species inhabiting the highlands of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. In the Eastern Pamirs (environs of Yashilkul Lake, Murghab region, Republic of Tajikistan), these animals climb to a height of 3800 m above sea level, which is the highest finding of amphibians on the territory of the former Soviet Union. B. baturae adhere to geothermal stream outlets year-round at the upper limit of their distribution, where they breed and overwinter. The features of reproduction and early development that have developed in this species in the conditions of high mountains are interesting. We caught eight pairs of adult B. baturae in August 2018 in the geothermal spring of the Sasyk-Bulak tract on the southern shore of Yashilkul Lake, from which offspring were obtained in the spring of 2019. The body length of adult females before spawning was 58.28-64.17 mm, and the weight was 25.90-32.93 g; males were 53.69-58.75 mm and 17.73-23.92 g. The fecundity of females was 882-1850 eggs. The embryo diameter was 1.18-2.19 mm. At a temperature of 16.0-20.5 degrees C, the duration of the egg incubation from laying to the release of prelarvae is 2-4 days, and the total duration of embryogenesis before the start of exogenous feeding is 8-11 days. The total length of the body with the tail in the prelarva upon separation from the calf cord is 2.26-4.31 mm, while it is 8.73-12.64 mm in the larva at the beginning of feeding. Larval development at 17.5-22.5 degrees C lasted 42-94 days. Compared to other species of the genus (B. sitibundus and B. viridis), the larvae of the Batura toad were characterized by a very long tail and black body color until the onset of metamorphosis. Young toads came ashore with a body length of 12.98-18.85 mm. An association between the body length of young toads and the duration of larval development was observed (r = 0.52, p <= 0.05). Thus, the majority of indicators of reproduction and early development in the Batura toad do not differ from other members of the genus Bufotes. The low fecundity of B. baturae females can be explained by their small size. At the same time, the authors consider the dark coloration and long tail of the larvae of this species to be adaptive traits for living in high-mountain flowing water bodies.

J	Qin, XC; Gong, Z; Liu, HZ				Qin, Xiangchao; Gong, Zheng; Liu, Huanzhang			Lateral migration of fish between China's second largest freshwater lake (Dongting Lake) and the mainstem of the Yangtze River	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Lateral migration of fish between Dongting Lake and the mainstem of Yangtze River was investigated at the channel connecting these two systems to identify its regular pattern and possible affecting factors. During the sampling period, a total of 55 fish species were recorded, with the lake-river migratory fish species dominating abundance all the time. Hierarchical clustering analysis found four temporal fish assemblages: Feb-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep and Oct-Jan, which was consistent with the rising and falling of water temperature and water level. The Movement index was used to measure the direction of fish migration, which was found closely associated with variations of water temperature, water level and flow discharge. Particularly, when water temperature and water level rose from March to July, fish migration showed the tendency of entering the lake; when they receded from August to February of the next year, fish migration showed the opposite tendency. Based on our results, we concluded that maintaining the river-lake connection is essential for the river-lake migratory fishes and the natural flow regime was the key driver in this floodplain ecosystem.

It was famous for the periodic reddening of its waters due to the blooming of the Glenodinium sanguineum, phenomena that has not occurred since the summer 1964. There is very little information about the microbiological composition of the lake, and we have evaluated, in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, the microbial counts of aerobic, anaerobic and sulfate-reducing bacteria. We have also evaluated the presence of methanobacteria. Whe have carried out tests in enclosures, where the phosphor-us concentration was augmented, evidencing an increase in the microbial population. It seems that an increasing in phosphorus would render the lake more adapt to the growth of microbial populations as well as that of Glenodinium, as indicated by the appearance of the reddening phenomenon.																			1590-4261						2002	52	1					13	23																WOS:000174643100002

It affects ice melting rate and has important ecological implications, in particular, by providing the vertical transport mechanism for non motile plankton species. In temperate lakes, convection depends strongly on the diurnal radiation cycle. We present the first data on the convective shear microstructure with the daytime variations resolved. In addition, for the first time the convection characteristics were achieved for the period immediately preceding the ice break-up, when fieldwork from the ice surface is not possible. The results validate the shear microstructure method for the under-ice convection in the absence of mean flow and provide the direct quantitative estimations of the convective mixing intensity. We outline the range of the convective variability within a day and its dependence on the amount of solar radiation penetrating the ice cover. The appropriate mixed layer scaling is discussed.

The model uses the initial lithospheric conditions and rifting parameters (thinning factors, effective elastic thickness and depth of necking) derived by large-scale lithospheric deformation modelling. Using a stratigraphic modelling approach, supported by a large and high-quality data set, constraints on the palaeo-water depth evolution of the basin and associated basement subsidence are provided. The model reproduces and provides explanations for several features of the stratigraphy of the Black Sea: the apparent near-absence of syn-rift strata (other than in the Western Pontides); thin to condensed early post-rift sequences in both basins; a thick Upper Eocene sequence in the Eastern Black Sea; a relatively thin Oligocene to Miocene sequence and a very thick Quaternary sequence.

Distributed topographic indicators for predicting nitrogen export from headwater catchments	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The possibility of using topographic indicators to predict spatial variation in dissolved nitrogen (N) export from headwater catchments was explored within a sugar maple forest in the Algoma Highlands of central Ontario, Canada, where the average annual export of total dissolved N export ranged from 3.58 to 6.96 kg N ha(-1) a(-1). Topographic indicators representing both "nondistributed'' and "distributed'' properties of the catchments were derived. Distributed topographic indicators that were designed to represent hydrologic flushing mechanism for N export were superior in predicting nitrate-N export, explaining up to 85% in average annual nitrate-N export and 90% in the slope of discharge versus peak nitrate-N export which occurred during spring melt. However, the distributed topographic indicators were comparable to nondistributed ones for dissolved organic nitrogen export, explaining up to 68% of the variance compared to 65%. This study shows that spatial variation in N export from catchments within a relatively small region can be substantial, but that distributed topographic indicators can be used to predict a majority of this N export and thereby provide a basis for extrapolating N export from a few intensively monitored catchments to many other catchments within the sugar maple forest of the Algoma Highlands.

J	Reid, NB; Naeth, MA				Reid, NB; Naeth, MA			Establishment of a vegetation cover on tundra kimberlite mine tailings: 2. A field study	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												High erosion potential of dewatered kimberlite mine tailings after diamond extraction has prompted research at the Ekati Diamond Mine in the Canadian subarctic heath tundra ecosystem. Greenhouse and field studies aimed at establishing a permanent vegetation cover on these dewatered tailings began in spring 2000. Coarse texture, no organic component, lack of available macronutrients, and a serpentine chemistry are the principal limitations of kimberlite tailings to plant colonization. Structure-improving (peat moss, lake sediment, and sewage sludge) and nutrient-providing (fertilizer, rock phosphate, calcium carbonate, and gypsum) amendments were tested to ameliorate these conditions, facilitating the establishment of a permanent vegetation cover, which stabilizes surface materials and promotes natural colonization by the surrounding tundra vegetation. Seven native grass species (Arctagrostis latifolia, Calamagrostis canadensis, Poa glauca, Poa alpina, Deschampsia beringensis, Deschampsia caespitosa, and Festuca rubra) were used to measure amendment success. With the addition of structure-improving and nutrient-providing amendments, plant growth on these kimberlite tailings under field conditions was significantly improved over unamended tailings material. Tailings properties, including cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, and macronutrient availability, were also improved with amendment addition.

J	Marshall, BE				Marshall, Brian E.			What affects fisheries in African lakes: Climate change or fishing effort? A case study from Lake Kariba	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Lake Kariba, created in 1958, experienced changes, notably the decline of the Limnothrissa miodon fishery, which have been attributed to climatic change. Air temperatures rose abruptly by 1.1 degrees C between 1980 and 1981, but the temperature of the lake did not follow this pattern. Temperatures at 10 m depth increased by 8% between 1961 and 1971, remained stable until 1984, then declined and by 1992 the temperature was about 7% lower than in 1961. The causes of this are unclear but it followed the hot and dry El Nino droughts of 1982-83 and 1991-92. The lake warmed again by 2007-2011 with temperatures at 10 m being about 10% higher than in 1961, while at 40 m it was 16% higher indicating a faster warming rate in deeper waters. The thermocline fell from 15-20 m in 1968 and 1986 to 20-25 m in 2011 and the temperature gradient decreased by > 50%. The epilimnion became more homogenous, with no evidence of anoxia in the upper 20 m in 2007-08, and the normal monomictic thermal regime may change, thus affecting nutrient circulation and the seasonal abundance of plankton. Both zooplankton and phytoplankton communities have evolved since the lake was created, but these changes occurred before any evidence of warming. The fishery has been declining since 1996 but there is no evidence that climate change is responsible; the number of fishing vessels is presently about three times the recommended level and fishing effort is almost certainly the main cause of the problems. All African lakes support fisheries and it is essential to consider fishing, which changes fish species composition, demographics and abundance, characters that could also be affected by climate change.																			1463-4988	1539-4077				MAR	2021	24	1					5	11		10.14321/aehm.024.01.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.024.01.03													WOS:000699887600003

Reproductive and histopathological effects in wild fish inhabiting an effluent-dominated stream, Wascana Creek, SK, Canada	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												During the winter low flow periods, Wascana Creek, Saskatchewan, Canada, can be 100% treated municipal wastewater downstream of the City of Regina's Wastewater Treatment Plant. The objective of this study was to determine if exposure to municipal effluent affects the health and reproductive development of fish in an effluent-dominated stream. Field studies were conducted on post-spawning (August 2006). spawning (June 2007), recrudescent (October 2007) and pre-spawning (May 20011) sentinel fish [Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas and Brook Stickleback Culaea inconstans] to asses; responses in terms of growth (condition factor), reproduction (in vitro sex steroid biosynthetic capacity, and gonadosomatic indices, histology) and survival associated with the effluent outfall. Sentinel species demonstrated varying responses depending on the season of field collections. While Stickleback collected downstream of the sewage discharge were often longer, heavier and had greater condition, Fatheads from the same site were shorter and lighter. Exposed fish of both species exhibited delayed spawning and altered gonadal development depending on the season. Exposed male Fathead Minnows also had significantly lower scores of secondary sexual characteristics (fewer nuptial tubercles, little or no development of the dorsal pad, and the lack of presence of a dorsal fin dot). Histopathology of exposed Fathead Minnows revealed thickening of the gill lamellae and alterations in structure of the kidneys (inflammation of the proximal tubules and Bowman's capsule). It is not known if the effluents are affecting natural reproduction and recruitment into this population or if these impacted populations rely on immigration from upstream reaches to sustain the populations. Climate change and human population growth will further challenge this effluent-dominated stream's ability to assimilate nutrients and contaminants which may further impair the performance of fish in this arid environment.

Quantitative analyses of phytoplankton and nutrient content were undertaken monthly from 2004 through 2008. After the cessation of aquaculture, no significant changes in nutrient concentration were detected. Nevertheless, the phytoplankton community changed greatly after the cessation. Firstly, the phytoplankton species richness as well as the Shannon-Wiener diversity index increased. Secondly, the chlorophylla concentration and the phytoplankton density declined sharply. This decrease was caused primarily by a decrease in Cyanophyta. Additionally, the Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta increased, leading to a decrease in the relative biomass of Cyanophyta. Thirdly, the dominant species shifted from the toxic cyanophyte Microcystis sp. to less harmful Cyanophyta such as Merismopedia sp. and Chroococcus sp., along with Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta. The phytoplankton community composition improved, indicating that the overall water quality was improved after the cessation. However, the changes in the phytoplankton community were more likely to be associated with the physical and biotic changes caused by the removal of aquaculture than with the variation in nutrient levels. Our study indicated that phytoplankton monitoring, especially in summer, is essential for assessing the water quality because an overall improvement in water quality may also be achieved without significant changes in nutrient concentrations. The rebounding of Cyanophyta in 2008 highlighted the importance of controlling nutrient loading by inflow for a substantial improvement in water quality. These results are relevant for managing subtropical eutrophic lakes.

The coastal ecosystems are facing recurrent hypoxia events (dissolved oxygen; DO < 2.0 mg L-1) and are emerging as a major threat to ecosystem structure and functioning. The Ashtamudi Lake, (area = 56 km(2)), is one of the Ramsar sites in the State of Kerala and located on the SW coast of India. The waterways are extensively used for backwater tourism and for fishery activities. This paper discusses the spatio-temporal variation of water quality attributes with emphasis on hypoxia during non-monsoon and monsoon seasons. The extent of hypoxia on fishery diversity was discussed. The Southern Zone, adjacent to the urban area, shows the hypoxic condition with higher concentration of BOD, NO3-N, and NH4-N. The hypoxic condition is largely limited to the Southern Zone in both seasons. The occurrence of low DO in the lake is highly related to salinity and organic load in the lake system. The tracking of pollution sources in the lake system was also done through identification of pollution potential zones and found that catchments adjacent to Southern and Western Zones (urban regions) are the major source of pollution. The study suggests that hypoxia is chiefly attributed to anthropogenic interventions in the form of discharge of wastes into the lake causing overloading of nutrients and organic effluents, decrease in the freshwater supply, the absence of proper freshwater mixing or dilution, and effluent discharge from nearby urban centers.					; Ghermandi, Andrea/AAI-1254-2019; kumar, Amit/M-3541-2015; Kumar, Amit/M-3541-2015	Joseph, Sabu/0000-0002-5415-588X; kumar, Amit/0000-0002-6073-0860; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2023	195	1							45	10.1007/s10661-022-10602-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10602-x								36305948					WOS:000876298100001

The older moraines and the outwash sediments have been dated using luminescence and radiocarbon dating techniques which has allowed an understanding of the causes, and patterns of glacier advances/retreat. Chrono-stratigraphy of multiple glacier advances reveals that the oldest glacier advance preserved in the region corresponds to the Marine Isotopic Stage-2 (MIS-2; global Last Glacial Maximum-gLGM) while the subsequent advances are younger. Our data provides a record of four glacier advances, named Thangu Glacier Advances (TGA-I to TGA-IV). The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating has yielded an age range between 28 +/- 2.8 and 22 +/- 2.4 ka for the oldest glacier advance (TGA-I).dated The second prominent glacier advance (TGA-II) is correlated with the Younger Dryas cooling event based on pro-glacial sediment OSL ages ranging between 11 +/- 0.8 and 9.9 +/- 0.8 ka. A minor advance/standstill, TGA-III seems to coincide with the 8.2 ka cooling event. TGA-IV is represented by prominent terminal moraines close to the present day glaciers and would have possibly occurred during the mid-late Holocene cooling. Post-gLGM deglaciation is dated between 18 +/- 2.2 and 15 +/- 2.6 ka whereas the second deglaciation following TGA-II represented by pro-glacial lake sediments abutting the TGA-II moraines, is dated between 11 +/- 0.8 and 9.9 +/- 0.8 ka. A close correspondence of glacier advances with periods of temperature minima would imply that the glaciers have actively responded to cooler temperatures associated with the mid-latitude westerlies in response to global variations and retreated during the enhanced monsoonal phases.					ali, sheikh'nawaz/NRY-7735-2025														0391-9838	1724-4781					2025	47	1								10.4454/ki45dfv4	http://dx.doi.org/10.4454/ki45dfv4													WOS:001461787400002

The concentration of several metal ions (Li, Ba, Al, Pb, As, Se) was measured in three points of the lake, namely receiving-input, middle and discharging-output ponds. The samples were collected during spring time from water, sediments, Ceratophyllum demersum, Phragmites australis reed, and Scardinius Erytrophtalmus fish. The ecological risk, the toxicity class based on the concentration of toxic metals into sediments, according to the Sediments Quality Guidelines (SQGs) and bio-concentration factor, (BCF), of metals in anatomical tissues of studied fishes were assessed. Experiments have shown that aluminum and barium had the highest concentration in water, sediments, aquatic plants and fish samples. Also, the metals bio-concentration is increased in branchiae and scales, compared with muscles and bones.

Lawrence			Quaternary glaciation and hydrologic variation in the South American tropics as reconstructed from the Lake Titicaca drilling project	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A 136-m-long drill core of sediments was recovered from tropical high-attitude Lake Titicaca, Bolivia-Peru, enabling a reconstruction of past climate that spans four cycles of regional glacial advance and retreat and that is estimated to extend continuously over the last 370,000 yr. Within the errors of the age model, the periods of regional glacial advance and retreat are concordant respectively with global glacial and interglacial stages. Periods of ice advance in the southern tropical Andes generally were periods of positive water balance, as evidenced by deeper and fresher conditions in Lake Titicaca. Conversely, reduced glaciation occurred during periods of negative water balance and shallow closed-basin conditions in the lake. The apparent coincidence of positive water balance of Lake Titicaca and glacial growth in the adjacent Andes with Northern Hemisphere ice sheet expansion implies that regional water balance and glacial mass balance are strongly influenced by global-scale temperature changes, as well as by precessional forcing of the South American summer monsoon.

Many sites were remote from susceptible or diseased crops. E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica was isolated much less fequently and no Erwinia bacteria were isolated from underground waters. Erwinia bacteria were also found in rain-water in Scotland, in winter snow from mountain passes in Colorado and in sea water from the west and east coasts of Scotland and from the coasts of Oregon, California, Texas, Louisiana and Florida. The significance of the occurrence of these bacteria in water is discussed in relation to the control of blackleg and soft rot diseases of potato by production of Erwinia-free stocks.																			0021-8847						1984	57	1					95	105		10.1111/j.1365-2672.1984.tb02361.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1984.tb02361.x													WOS:A1984TG15400011
J	Curray, JR				Curray, JR			Origin of beach ridges: Comment	MARINE GEOLOGY												Tanner (1995) has proposed that most common strand plain sandy beach ridges (his swash-built type) have been formed by a sea level rise-and-fall couplet of 5-30 cm, with a periodicity which is most commonly 30-60 years, but which ranges from as little as 3 to as much as 60 years. While such a mechanism could perhaps apply to beach ridges in lakes, if sea level has fluctuated with such regularity for the past several thousand years, all open ocean beach ridge periodicities should be the same, and furthermore this sea level signal would surely have been detected by physical oceanographers. Curray et al. (1969) described a strand plain of several hundred beach ridges on the western Mexican coast with cyclic formation of ridges varying from 12.2 to 16.5 years. The mechanism of formation invoked was periodic building of offshore bars to above sea level after sufficient sand had been transported into the area and during an optimal combination of oceanographic conditions.																			0025-3227					DEC	1996	136	1-2					121	125		10.1016/S0025-3227(96)00040-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0025-3227(96)00040-0													WOS:A1996VZ19200007
J	Ryan, SM; Dodson, SI				Ryan, SM; Dodson, SI			Seasonal analysis of Daphnia pulicaria swimming behavior	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Our study documents individual swimming behavior of Daphnia pulicaria over a yearly cycle in a temperate lake. We collected D. pulicaria, a common freshwater zooplankton, from Lake Mendota on 10 dates between July 1994 and June 1995 from two depths, 2 m and 10 m. The Daphnia were rushed to the laboratory and video-taped as they swam in lake water under lake-ambient temperature and light conditions. Five-second swimming tracks of individual Daphnia were filmed and digitized using a motion analysis system. We measured average turning angle, swimming speed and sinking rate for each track. D. pulicaria swimming behavior varied over the annual cycle. We found significant differences in turning angle between depths and among months. Sinking rate and swimming speed were significantly different among months but not depths. Sinking rate and swimming speed were not significantly correlated with water temperature. Our results were contrary to Stokes' Law predictions, in that D. pulicaria had the slowest sinking speed in June, not in the winter when water temperatures were lowest and viscosity was highest. Body length was significantly correlated with all three swimming variables. We also studied swimming behavior in clonal populations of D. pulicaria in different concentrations of the alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. D. pulicaria did not change swimming speed, turning angle or sinking rate over a range of food concentrations. Finally, swimming behavior in a D. pulicaria clone, tested at two temperatures in the laboratory, confirmed the results from our seasonal study; Daphnia did not sink as predicted by changes in viscosity.																			0018-8158						1998	384						111	118		10.1023/A:1003295210747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003295210747													WOS:000078947900011

Six lakes were chosen for comparative study of species composition and diversity in relation to environmental variations. Lake heterogeneity was described with environmental physico-chemical variables, using principal component analysis. Sixteen families, composed of 75 species of fish were found in the studied lakes, Cyprinidae being the dominant group. Fish species were divided by habitat preference and trophic guild: benthopelagic and herbivorous fish were the most common guilds in all lakes. Species diversity and richness were significantly higher in spring, while the evenness, expressed by equitability of Simpson's index, was not significantly different among seasons. Species richness and diversity were significantly higher in vegetated lakes (e. g. Liangzihu Lake) than in non-vegetated lakes (e. g. Biandantang Lake), with the largest area (Liangzihu Lake) harbouring the largest species richness and the greatest diversity. The relationship between environmental variables and fish assemblage were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The dominant gradients describing species composition and abundance among the sampling sites were: total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, transparency and water depth. Our study led to the following conclusions: 1) the water quality was better - i.e. high transparency, low total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) and chlorophyll a- in vegetated lakes than in unvegetated lakes; 2) vegetated lakes had higher fish diversity than unvegetated lakes; 3) fish relative abundance (CPUE: number of fish per fishing pass) was significantly related to water chemical parameters. Consequently, the details of the findings are useful and relevant for developing suitable conservation strategies to sustain the integrity of fish communities in these lakes.

The surface plume is more particularly studied from coastal oceanographic surveys and NOAA/AVHRR satellite data collected during a French programme of coastal oceanography (PNOC-Atlantic). The AVHRR reflectances are atmospherically corrected according to an algorithm based on the clear water concept. The comparison with suspended sediment concentrations are realised by direct and indirect calibrations. The correlations obtained show that at a same concentration the reflectance varies, probably because of varying particle (floc) size and composition. The shape and the surface measured from low resolution (4 km x 4 km) and high resolution (1 km x 1 km) AVHRR data are then compared to the forcings introduced by the fluvial output, the tide, neap and spring tide and the wind variations. The latter have an important effect on the orientation of the distal part of the turbid plume.

Simulating Landfast Ice in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Landfast ice plays an important role in the nearshore hydrodynamics of large lakes, such as the dampening of surface waves and currents. In this study, previously developed landfast ice basal stress parameterizations were added to an unstructured grid hydrodynamic ice model to represent the effects of grounded ice keels and tensile strength of ice cover. Numerical experiments using this model were conducted to evaluate the development of coastal landfast ice in Lake Superior. A sensitivity study of the free parameters was conducted from December 2018 to May 2021 to cover both high and low ice cover winters in Lake Superior and was compared against observations from the United States National Ice Center. The model reproduces the annual variation in coastal landfast ice in Lake Superior, particularly in shallow nearshore areas and the semi-enclosed bays in the northern regions of the lake. Experiments also show that the growth of landfast ice is mainly controlled by the free parameter that controls the critical ice thickness for the activation of basal stress. Overall, the model tends to underestimate the extent of coastal landfast against observations.

J	Persaud, E; Levison, J; Ali, G; Robinson, C				Persaud, Elisha; Levison, Jana; Ali, Genevieve; Robinson, Clare			Using isotopic tracers to enhance routine watershed monitoring-Insights from an intensively managed agricultural catchment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Experimental (research-based) and non-research-based watershed monitoring programs often differ with respect to sampling frequency, monitored variables, and monitoring objectives. Isotopic variables, which are more commonly incorporated in research-based programs, can provide an indication of water sources and the transit time of water in a catchment. These variables may be a valuable complement to traditional water quality monitoring variables and have the potential to support improved hydrologic process-related insights from long term monitoring programs that typically have low resolution sampling. The purpose of this investigation is to explore the utility of incorporating isotopic variables (specifically & delta;18O, & delta;2H, and 222Rn) into routine monthly sampling regimes by comparing insights gained from these variables to monitoring only specific conductivity and chloride. A complete annual cycle of monthly groundwater and surface water monitoring data collected from the Upper Parkhill watershed in southwestern Ontario, Canada was used to characterize baseline watershed conditions, evaluate watershed resilience to climate change, and examine contamination vulnerability. Study results provide an improved understanding of appropriate tracer use in agricultural regions with isotopic variables able to provide important insights into the seasonality of hydrologic phenomena, such as the timing of groundwater recharge. A comparison of monitoring variables to present-day hydro-meteorological conditions suggests the importance of a winter dominated hydrologic regime and the potential influence of changes in precipitation on groundwater-surface water interactions. Estimated transit time dynamics indicate the likelihood for rapid contaminant transport through surface and shallow subsurface flow and highlight the possible effects of agricultural tile drainage. The sampling approach and data analysis methods adopted in this study provide the basis for improving routine watershed monitoring programs in agricultural regions.					; Robinson, Clare/E-4625-2012	Levison, Jana/0000-0003-3524-1392; Persaud, Elisha/0009-0007-2054-0986													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 15	2023	344								118364	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118364		JUL 2023						37399619					WOS:001031908900001
J	Nyairo, WN; Owuor, PO; Kengara, FO				Nyairo, Wilfrida Nyanduko; Owuor, Philip Okinda; Kengara, Fredrick Orori			Effect of anthropogenic activities on the water quality of Amala and Nyangores tributaries of River Mara in Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Mau Forest in the upper reaches of the Mara River basin has recently undergone increased forest destruction followed by human settlement and agricultural activities. These anthropogenic activities may be contributing nutrients and heavy metals, ultimately polluting the river water and eventually Lake Victoria water hence damaging these aquatic ecosystems. This study sought to establish the effect of anthropogenic activities and season on the water quality of the Amala and Nyangores tributaries of the River Mara in Kenya. Pristine springs in the Mau Forest were used as reference sites. Water samples were analyzed for pH, temperature, conductivity, nutrients, selected heavy metals, and selenium. The mean range of the parameters measured from sites along the tributaries was pH 5.44-7.48 and that for conductivity was 20-99 mu S/cm while the mean range of nutrient levels (mu g/L) was 80-443 (NO3--N), 21.7-82.7 (NH4+-N), 11.9-65.0 (soluble reactive phosphorous), and 51-490 (total phosphorous). The mean range for heavy metals and selenium (in mu g/L) from sites along the tributaries were 6.56-37.6 (Cu), 0.26-4.97 (Cd), 13.9-213 (Zn), 0.35-3.14 (Cr), 0.19-5.53 (Mn), 1.90-9.62 (Pb), and 0.21-4.50 (Se). The results indicated a significant difference (p = 0.05) between the reference sites and the different sampling sites, indicating that anthropogenic activities were impacting the quality of water in the two tributaries. Although most of the parameters were within the WHO (2004), USEPA (2014) and NEMA (2006) acceptable limits for surface waters, they were above the permissible levels for domestic use. Moreover, the levels of nutrients, heavy metals, and selenium were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season, further indicating that anthropogenic activities are causing a disturbance in the aquatic system. Therefore, further anthropogenic activities should be checked and limited so as to conserve the ecosystem.					; Kengara, Fredrick/U-4945-2017; Nyairo, Wilfrida/LGB-2768-2024	Nyairo, Wilfrida Nyanduko/0000-0002-9174-9177; Owuor, Philip Okinda/0000-0002-2571-0653; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2015	187	11							691	10.1007/s10661-015-4913-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4913-8								26475171					WOS:000363964000033

Regulated and Unregulated Halogenated Flame Retardants in Peregrine Falcon Eggs from Greenland	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Median levels of regulated flame retardants, i.e., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), brominated biphenyl (BB)-153, and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), in 33-48 eggs of peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) from Greenland were 1909, 359, and 5.98 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively, and generally intermediate to levels in North America and Europe. Unregulated flame retardants had lower median concentrations of 1.06 (2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate, EH-TBB), 2.42 (1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-ethane, BTBPE), 0.52 (2,4,6-tribromophenyl 2,3-dibromopropyl ether, DPTE), and 4.78 (dechlorane plus) ng/g lw. Although these compounds are often described as recent replacements for PBDEs, they were also present in eggs from the 1980s.

Aeromonas salmonicida is a bacterial fish pathogen that causes devastating losses worldwide. Currently, there are five accepted subspecies of Aeromonas salmonicida: A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, masoucida, smithia, achromogenes, and pectinolytica. We discuss the discovery of an isolate of A. salmonicida that is pathogenic to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and exhibits unique phenotypic and molecular characteristics. We examined 181 adult sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) from the Humber River (Lake Ontario watershed) and 162 adult sea lamprey from Duffins Creek (Lake Ontario watershed) during the spring seasons of 2005-11. Among those, 41343 (1.2%) sea lamprey were culture positive for A. salmonicida, whereby biochemical and molecular studies identified three of the isolates as A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. The remaining isolate (As-SL1) recovered from Humber River sea lamprey was phenotypically more similar to A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida than to the four other A. salmonicida subspecies. However, unlike A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, As-SL1 was sucrose positive, produced an acid-over-acid reaction on triple-sugar iron medium and did not amplify with A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida specific primers. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial stretches of the 16S rRNA and DNA gyrase subunit B genes further confirmed that the As-SL1 isolate was not A. salmonicida subsp. masoucida, smithia, achromogenes, or pectinolytica. Based on our analyses, the As-SL1 isolate is either an unusual strain of A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida or a novel A. salmonicida subspecies. The four A. salmonicida isolates that were recovered from sea lamprey were pathogenic to rainbow trout in experimental challenge studies. Our study also underscores the potential role of sea lamprey in the ecology of infectious fish diseases.					faisal, M/GQB-4757-2022														0090-3558	1943-3700				APR	2014	50	2					159	170		10.7589/2013-01-026	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/2013-01-026								24484501					WOS:000336237900001

In this study, images from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Landsat Imager (OLI) over the period from 1984 to 2022 are used to study the spatiotemporal variation in Jiaozhou Bay, a typical semi-enclosed bay in China, and to gain the insights into the drivers for the variation during the study period. The satellite images are first processed to obtain ZSD, and corrected against the field measurements to ensure the ZSD to be high-quality, and then the spatial and temporal distributions of ZSD are analysed. The results show that the regional monthly average ZSD over the study period are the highest in May and lowest in January. From long-term seasonal observation, it declines most significantly in Summer. In terms of inter-annual variation, the results clearly indicate that 2015 was a turning point, as the regional average ZSD decreased significantly from 1984 to 2014 at a rate of approximately 0.022 m/year, but significantly increased from 2015 to 2022 with a rate of about 0.049 m/year. The turning trend of the water clarity in Jiaozhou Bay can be mainly attributed to the increasing sunshine duration during 2015-2022, as well as rapidly reduction emissions of industrial waste from Qingdao city during 2015-2016.

J	Istvánovics, V; Somlyódy, L; Clement, A				Istvánovics, V; Somlyódy, L; Clement, A			Cyanobacteria-mediated internal eutrophication in shallow Lake Balaton after load reduction	WATER RESEARCH												Nutrient loads to large, shallow Lake Balaton have been reduced by 45-50% since mid-1980s. While a delayed, but still surprisingly fast recovery was observed in the hypertrophic western areas of the lake, eutrophication followed sewage diversion from the mesotrophic northern basins. We assessed factors that could lead to this unusual response. The prime reason of the observed biomass increase might be a trend of increasing mean water temperature during late summers and the concurrent invasion of the subtropical cyanobacterium. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii with superior light and nutrient utilisation capabilities. In the mesotrophic areas, the prerequisite of the unforeseen success of C raciborskii was the exceptionally high potential of this species to generate internal P load.

J	France, RL				France, RL			Biomass and production of amphipods in low alkalinity lakes affected by acid precipitation	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Population biomass and production of the amphipod Hyalella azteca (Saussure) were found to be related to alkalinity (ranging from 0.2 to 58.1 mg liter(-1)) in 10 Canadian Shield lakes in south-central Ontario. Biomass and production of amphipods in the two lakes characterized by spring depressions of pH below 5.0 were found to be lower than those for populations inhabiting lakes that did not experience such acid pulses. The proportional biomass of amphipods in relation to the total littoral zoobenthos community was lower in lakes of low alkalinity than in circumneutral pr hardwater lakes. Because production in these amphipod populations is known to depend closely on population abundance, the labour-intensive derivation of production rates yields relatively little information for biomonitoring that cannot be obtained from abundance data alone.

The aim of this study was to enhance the understanding of natural ecological dynamics in the pelagic habitat of Alpine lakes by enlarging the number of biotic and abiotic variables usually considered to this end and by increasing the frequency of samplings, generally low in remote lakes. During the eight samplings performed in 2009, chemical and physical variables were measured both in situ and in the laboratory. We also followed the dynamics of all the compartments of the naturally simplified trophic chain of the two lakes from pico-prokaryotes to phytoplankton and zooplankton. Our results confirm the oligotrophic, close-to-pristine state of lake Nivolet and lake Trebecchi as they are not affected by hydromorphological alterations, they are naturally fishless and are not sensitive to acidification risk and acidity pulses. On the other hand, the two lakes have distinct abiotic conditions due to their glacial origin and to the lithological composition of their watersheds. We found some differences in the spatial variation of pico-prokaryotes, phytoplankton and zooplankton due to the different mixing regimes and maximum depth of the two lakes. Conversely, temporal patterns were similar in both lakes, related to ecological interactions and to changes in the abiotic conditions. The rapid succession of events in extreme ecosystems, such as the Alpine lakes studied here, confirm the predominant role of external environmental factors (e.g., the duration of the ice-free season) and of ecological interactions among different trophic compartments. This research underlines the importance of seasonal niche partitioning among organisms with different size.					; ROGORA, MICHELA/B-9237-2008; Marchetto, Aldo/H-3258-2013; Morabito, Giuseppe/I-6633-2013; von Hardenberg, Jost/D-1872-2010; Tiberti, Rocco/AAM-7103-2021; Austoni, Martina/IXD-7503-2023; ROGORA, MICHELA/IZD-8951-2023	Metta, Sabino/0000-0002-9550-5911; Tiberti, Rocco/0000-0003-1617-8826; ROGORA, MICHELA/0000-0003-3515-0220; Marchetto, Aldo/0000-0002-1033-4114; Austoni, Martina/0000-0002-8214-1442													1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	3					401	416		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e33	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e33													WOS:000326626700001

Multivariate models (ANCOVA) were developed to quantify the relationship between AVT, pH, body size, and season. Brain AVT levels increased with body size, and the allometric slope was highest in the low-pH lakes (pH 5.0-5.5). Although brook trout >150 mm had higher brain AVT levels at low pH, no significant differences were detected for brook trout <150 mm. We hypothesize that the sensitivity of brook trout at the parr stage to acid stress may be linked to their inability to mobilize a hormonal response involving AVT. The seasonal variation in brain AVT levels was similar in all the lakes studied, summer levels being the highest. Although this field study revealed that AVT levels depend also on factors other than acid stress (body size and season), our ANCOVA models allow adjustment for the effects of these covariables. Analyses of this type can be used to field test and calibrate biomarkers for use in ecotoxicology.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1993	50	8					1717	1727		10.1139/f93-193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-193													WOS:A1993MP10900015

(Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta): Taxonomy, temperature-dependent growth, photosynthetic characteristics and fatty acid composition	ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS												The problem of studying the species diversity of representatives of the genus Micractinium (Chlorophyta) remains relevant for its simple morphology and high phenotypic plasticity. At the same time, such studies are of great practical importance, since some of them have high biotechnological potential, because they are capable of accumulating valuable metabolites, including polyunsaturated fatty acids. The studied strains ACSSI 343, ACSSI 344, and ACSSI 345 were isolated from eutrophic reservoirs of the Vasilievsky Lakes system (Samara region, Russia), the strain ACSSI 332 - from a hot spring on the Chukotka Peninsula (Russia). All of them have a Chlorella-like morphology: single spherical cells, without bristles, chloroplast parietal with one pyrenoid, and reproduction by autospores. However, analysis of the fragment 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 showed that the studied strains belong to the genus Micractinium. Comparison of morphological characteristics at standard temperatures (20-24 degrees C), habitat and lifestyle, phylogenetic analysis findings, results of studying the effects of elevated temperatures (up to 41 degrees C) and the effect of high nutrient content on strain morphology and reproduction, as well as analysis of fatty acids profile allowed to establish that the studied strains are representatives of 2 new species with high biotechnological potential - M. lacustre and M. thermotolerans spp. nov.					; Degtyaryov, Evgeniy/KFA-1571-2024; Sinetova, Maria/L-5684-2015; Savchenko, Tatyana/E-7091-2014; Temraleeva, Anna/M-8066-2016; Krivina, Elena/ABG-4501-2020	Tebina, Elizaveta/0000-0002-5970-530X; Krivina, Elena/0000-0002-0849-5832; Sinetova, Maria/0000-0001-9931-1762; Degtyaryov, Evgeniy/0000-0002-9266-7317; Temraleeva, Anna/0000-0002-3445-0507; 													2211-9264					APR	2023	71								103042	10.1016/j.algal.2023.103042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2023.103042		MAR 2023											WOS:000955525600001

In this study, we introduce a new methodology to develop homogenised Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) from multiple polar orbiting satellites. Precisely, we developed homogenised 1 km daily LSWT maps covering the last 30 years (1986 to 2015) combining data from 13 satellites. We used a split-window technique to derive LSWT from brightness temperatures and a modified diurnal temperature cycle model to homogenise data which were acquired between 8: 00 to 17:00 UTC. Gaps in the temporal LSWT data due to the presence of clouds were filled by applying Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS). The satellite derived LSWT maps were validated based on long-term monthly in-situ bulk temperature measurements in Lake Garda, the largest lake in Italy. We found the satellite derived homogenised LSWT being significantly correlated to in-situ data. The new LSWT time series showed a significant annual rate of increase of 0.020 degrees C yr(-1) (*P < 0.05), and of 0.036 degrees C yr(-1) (*** P < 0.001) during summer.

Exposure of American black bears to various pathogens in Wisconsin	URSUS												We compared location, sex, and season of 97 American black bears (Ursus americanus) captured and sampled from March 2003 to March 2006 near Lakewood and Hiles, Wisconsin, USA, relative to exposure to toxoplasmosis, canine distemper virus (CDV), eastern equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, canine parvovirus, and tularemia. A large percentage of black bears in both locations had antibodies against CDV and toxoplasmosis (41.1-56.9% and 41.8-67.4%, respectively). Exposure of bears to CDV was significantly higher in those sampled during the winter. There was strong evidence that exposure to toxoplasmosis was significantly greater in bears near Hiles than those near Lakewood. There was weak evidence that exposure to tularemia was different in bears near Hiles than those near Lakewood. There was also weak evidence that exposure to tularemia was different in females than males. We found only a small percentage of black bears with detectable antibodies against eastern equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and St. Louis encephalitis (2.2-3.8%, 2.2-4.3%, and 0-2.8%, respectively) at both locations. Our results are similar to those of other studies, suggesting that exposure to toxoplasmosis and CDV may be prevalent among black bears across North America. We also draw attention to the need for validation studies for serological tests in black bears, so that accurate measures of sensitivity and specificity of these tests may be provided.

Ongoing research seeks to gain novel insights on the microbial ecology of such environments, in order to further the understanding of life adaptation to extreme conditions. To this aim, the abundance of prokaryotic cells (including cell morphologies and size for biomass conversion), the amount of viable cells (in terms of membrane-intact cells and respiring cells), the viral count, the physiological profiles at community level and the main microbial enzymatic activities were described. The brines differed each other in terms of prokaryotic cells' abundance, size, and viability as well as viral abundance. Cell morphotypes and metabolic responses also varied among the brine samples. Underground interconnections were likely to occur, with the microbial community becoming more abundant and structured to better exploit the limited resource availability. Overall, complex interactions among multiple environmental factors, including marine water origin, depth horizon, isolation time of the brines, and climatic variations, reflected on the microbial community distribution patterns and highlighted the need to preserve these niches of extreme life.					azzaro, Maurizio/AAE-6784-2019; Caruso, Gabriella/F-5450-2013	Caruso, Gabriella/0000-0002-3819-5486; Rappazzo, Alessandro Ciro/0000-0002-3875-7338													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2021	848	8					1837	1857		10.1007/s10750-021-04557-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04557-2		MAR 2021											WOS:000623718100001
J	STANG, O				STANG, O			ON THE HEAT-EXCHANGE BETWEEN RIVERS AND ATMOSPHERE	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												To predict water temperatures in rivers which are to be harnessed for hydro power, it is essential to take into account the heat exchange with the atmosphere. It is often sufficient to predict average temperatues and temperature changes for periods of some days. A simple model for the heat exchange between flowing water and atmosphere was developed for this purpose. The model offers a semi-empirical relationship between air temperature and water temperature. The model is applied to the Orkla River in central Norway, and a demonstration of how the analyses of diurnal variations of water and air temperatures make it possible to predict the downstream decay of temperature changes originating from man-made releases. An average heat exchange coefficient is calculated for Orkla for the summer of 1980. The cooling/heating rate in the flowing water in Orkla is considerably greater than the one for lakes under the same meteorological conditions.																			0029-1277						1982	13	2					65	78																WOS:A1982NX20800001

Grain-size characterization of reworked fine-grained aeolian deposits	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												After a previous review of the grain-size characteristics of in situ (primary) fine-grained aeolian deposits, reworked (secondary) aeolian deposits, as modified in lacustrine environments and by alluvial and pedogenic processes, are discussed in this paper. As a reference, the grain-size characteristics of primary loess deposits are shortly described. Commonly, pedogenesis and weathering of primary loess may lead to clay neoformation and thus to an enrichment in grain diameters of 4-8 mu m, a size which is comparable to the fine background loess. Remarkably, the modal grain-size values of primary loess are preserved after re -deposition in lakes and flood plains. But, secondary lacustrine settings show a very characteristic admixture with a clayey population of 1-2,5 mu m diameter due to the process of settling in standing water. Similarly, alluvial settings show often an addition with coarse-grained sediment supplied by previously eroded sediment. However, floodplain settings show also often the presence of pools and other depressions which behave similarly to lacustrine environments. As a result, alluvial secondary loess sediments are characterized by the poorest grain-size sorting when compared with the other secondary loess and primary loess. Despite the characteristic texture of each of these deposits, grain-size characteristics of the described individual sediment categories are not always fully diagnostic and thus grain-size analysis should be complemented by other information, as sedimentary structures and fauna or flora, to reliably reconstruct the sedimentary processes and environments.					; Sun, Youbin/K-8357-2012; Vandenberghe, Jef/H-5846-2019; wang, xianyan/ABO-8369-2022; Liu, Xingxing/ABF-9303-2021	wang, xianyan/0000-0002-8281-5734; Sun, Youbin/0000-0002-6696-6620; Vandenberghe, Jef/0000-0001-9910-1319; Abels, Hemmo/0000-0001-7648-3369; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				FEB	2018	177						43	52		10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.11.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.11.005													WOS:000426409200005

Spatiotemporal patterns in nutrient loads, nutrient concentrations, and algal biomass in Lake Taihu, China. Lake Reserv Manage. 27:298-309. Lake Taihu, China's third largest freshwater lake, exemplifies the severity of eutrophication problems in rapidly developing regions. We used long term land use, water quality, and hydrologic data from 26 in-lake and 32 tributary locations to describe the spatiotemporal patterns in nutrient loads, nutrient concentration, algal biomass, measured as chlorophyll a (Chl-a), in Lake Taihu. Point and nonpoint sources, as determined by chemical oxygen demand, contributed approximately 75 and 25% of the total nutrient loads to the lake, respectively. Spatial patterns in total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in Lake Taihu strongly corresponded with observed loads from adjoining rivers with high concentrations proximate to densely populated areas. Chl-a concentrations exhibited spatial patterns similar to TP and TN concentrations. Generally, nutrient and Chl-a concentrations were highest in the northwestern region of the lake and lowest in the southeastern region of the lake. Seasonally, the largest nutrient loads occurred during summer. The annual net retention rate of TP and TN in Lake Taihu was approximately 30% of the total load. This study identifies regions of the lake and the watershed that are producing more nutrients to develop targeted management strategies. Reducing external P and N input from both point and nonpoint sources is obviously critical to address water quality issues in the lake. In addition, atmospheric deposition and resuspension of existing lake sediments also likely play a role in eutrophication processes and harmful algal blooms occurrence.

Hydroclimatic drivers associated with an unusual bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa and increase of CyanoHABs in a deep oligotrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Hydroclimatic and anthropogenic factors in climate change scenarios contribute to ecological changes of harmful cyanobacterial algal blooms in lakes. This study describes the variability of the bathymetric and temporal distribution of cyanobacterial communities in a deep oligotrophic lake. An increase of two to nine in the detection of CyanoHABs potential was observed, likely linked to nitrogen contributions to Lake Rupanco during the last 36 years related to changes in land use and the cultivation of salmonids. We recorded an unusual bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa in winter, 2017 at 30 m during the total mixing period of the lake, associated with the highest N/P index (16.24), the increase of total nitrogen (75 mu g/L) and climatic conditions that favored the availability of nitrogen of this cyanobacterium. This study provides information on the causes of increased cyanobacteria in a deep oligotrophic lake. Long-term information on the composition of cyanobacterial communities is very helpful in determining ecological changes.					; Díaz, Patricio/B-8128-2018	Rios-Henriquez, Catalina/0000-0002-1988-5780; Fuentes, Norka/0000-0001-5853-6033													0142-7873	1464-3774				JAN 25	2022	44	1					68	72		10.1093/plankt/fbab079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbab079													WOS:000761462500006

Here, we use ZonalBAM to study the response of the coupled biosphere-atmosphere system to changes in the Earth's orbital forcing during the Middle Holocene (6K yrs BP) and the relative contribution of vegetation feedbacks. Simulations in which vegetation conditions were fixed to the current distribution, show that an orbitally induced increased seasonality in insolation for the Middle Holocene, by itself, results in a 1.1degrees northward shift in the location of the southern margin of the Sahara as compared to current solar forcings. When vegetation is allowed to be dynamic, a 2.4degrees northward shift is simulated. However, when dynamic vegetation is initialized to palaeovegetation, a 5.1degrees northward shift is simulated, bringing results more consistent with palaeoevidence. Based on previous studies on the role of the gradient of moist static energy on the dynamics of large-scale tropical circulations, a mechanism for the enhancement of the summer monsoon circulation has been developed. Our results suggest that multiple equilibria could have coexisted over the region of West Africa during the Middle Holocene. Furthermore, based on previous studies on the current climate over the region, we hypothesize that transitions between the different equilibria could have taken place during the Middle Holocene causing the southern desert margin to migrate between 18.1degreesN and 21.4degreesN and shaping climate variability.

The white suckers occupying Hamell Lake, Saskatchewan, which is contaminated by Zn, Cu and Cd, showed signs typical of a population under stress when compared with the population in Thompson Lake, Manitoba, which contains much lower levels of these metals. Hamell Lake white suckers showed greatly increased growth in length and weight, increased fecundity and earlier age of maturation, but reduced spawning success, reduced larval and egg survival, smaller egg size and reduced longevity compared with Thompson Lake white suckers. These differences are attributed to elevated heavy metals in Hamell Lake waters, particularly in early spring, a most critical period in the reproductive cycle of these fish. Effects of the metals on other species of fish in Hamell Lake are also discussed.																									1978	35	7					963	970		10.1139/f78-157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-157													WOS:A1978FD09000003
J	Fiser, C; Zagmajster, M; Zaksek, V				Fiser, Cene; Zagmajster, Maja; Zaksek, Valerija			Coevolution of life history traits and morphology in female subterranean amphipods	OIKOS												Subterranean species show a distinct morphology, yet the adaptive significance of some traits, like body size and shape, is poorly understood and cannot be explained solely by distinct environmental conditions (darkness, less food). We predicted that in females some morphological changes may have co-evolved with life history traits, and that co-evolving life history traits provide at least part of the explanation for evolutionary changes of morphology. Using museum material we tested this prediction on the subterranean amphipod genus Niphargus. We studied six species found in springs and eight species found in cave lakes. We treated them as two ecologically distinct groups, and the major ecological differences between them were the availability of nutrients and the water currents. Cave species were found to be larger and stouter (as inferred from the shape of coxal plates, which are part of the marsupium), they had larger eggs and lower reproductive effort per brood, whereas the egg number and brood volume if corrected for the body size were not different. Using phylogenetic independent contrasts, we found a positive correlation between body shape and egg volume, a positive correlation between body size and egg volume, and a negative correlation between body size and reproductive effort per brood. We tentatively conclude that evolutions of morphology and life histories are functionally connected and that co-evolving traits contribute to overall selective regime.

Zooplankton community structure in the presence of low levels of cyanotoxins: a case study in a high altitude tropical reservoir (Valle de Bravo, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Valle de Bravo water reservoir in the State of Mexico is being intensively studied since it provides water to about 2,500,000 people living in Mexico City. Cyanobacterial blooms reduce the water quality in this reservoir and this poses health risks. We hypothesize that one of the reasons for these persistent blooms is the dominance of small sized zooplankton throughout the year. Zooplankton samples were collected monthly by filtering 50 L of water from the surface (10-20 cm) using a 50 mu m mesh and the samples were fixed in 4% formalin in the field. We measured temperature, pH, conductivity, Secchi disk transparency, dissolved oxygen, nitrates and phosphates. The microcystin levels were also quantified. The Secchi depth ranged from 0.86 to 9 m, nitrate levels were low (0.28 to 2.06 mg L-1), while phosphates were in the range of 1 to 14 mg L-1. The temperature varied from 14 to 25 degrees C. The zooplankton community was represented by 25 species of rotifers Keratella cochlearis had the highest density (840 ind L-1, followed by Polyarthra vulgaris (750 ind L-1). As compared to previous studies where the genus Brachionus was practically absent, we found four brachionid species. Among cladocerans, Bosmina longirostris was the dominant taxa reaching up to 100 ind L-1. Small sized zooplankton (<200 m) dominated throughout the year. The zooplankton biomass in the winter months (December to February) was contributed by Daphnia laevis, copepodites and adult copepods. Unlike a decade ago when adominance by cyanobacteria was recorded, in this study we found that the phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms and chlorophytes with an occasional presence of the cyanobacteria Anabaena spp. and Microcystis spp. The concentration of microcystins ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 g L-1 and was within the parameters set by the WHO. Carlson's Trophic State Index and Sladecek's Brachionus/Trichocerca ratio indicated that the reservoir was mesotrophic during the study period.					; Nandini, S./AFN-8031-2022; Sarma, S.S.S./G-3634-2010	Sarma, S.S.S./0000-0003-2820-1579; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2014	73	1					157	166		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.784	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.784													WOS:000338928300014
J	Van de Vijver, B; Beyens, L				Van de Vijver, B; Beyens, L			Freshwater diatoms form Ile de la Possession (Crozet Archipelago, sub-Antarctica): an ecological assessment	POLAR BIOLOGY												An ecological study of freshwater waterbodies on Ile de la Possession (Crozet Archipelago, Antarctica) was undertaken during the austral summer of 1997/ 1998. Both diatom and chemistry data were collected. A highly diverse diatom flora of 210 taxa, belonging to 32 genera, was identified from 127 samples. The most abundant genera were Fragilaria, Achnanthes and Navicula. Principal Component Analysis was used to classify the samples on the basis of their chemical characteristics. The analysis revealed that pH and chloride were the main factors dividing the samples into three categories: rivers, more acid lakes, and lakes with higher chloride content. Species assemblages correspond well with this division. Forward selection with Monte Carlo permutations selected pH, chloride, habitat and hardness. Based on the analysis, four groups of samples can be made: rivers, acid lakes, circumneutral lakes with low chloride concentrations and coastal pools with relatively high chloride levels. The results also indicate that a specific diatom flora exists on the island, which is comparable to that of other islands in the same area (Kerguelen and Macquarie).

Delayed hydrological response to Greenland cooling at the onset of the Younger Dryas in western Europe	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The general warming trend of the last deglaciation was interrupted by the Younger Dryas, a period of abrupt cooling and widespread environmental change(1-10). Ice core records suggest the abrupt cooling began 12,846 years ago in Greenland(10), about 170 years before the significant environmental and vegetation change in western Europe(7) classically defined as the Younger Dryas. However, this difference in timing falls within age model uncertainties. Here we use the hydrogen isotope composition of lipid biomarkers from precisely dated varved sediments from Lake Meerfelder Maar to reconstruct hydroclimate over western Europe. We observe a decrease in the hydrogen isotope values of both aquatic and terrestrial lipids 12,850 years ago, indicating cooling climate in this region synchronous with the abrupt cooling in Greenland. A second drop occurs 170 years later, mainly in the hydrogen isotope record of aquatic lipids but to a lesser extent in the terrestrial lipids, which we attribute to aridification, as well as a change in moisture source and pathway. We thus confirm that there was indeed a lag between cooling and substantial hydrologic and environmental change in western Europe. We suggest the delay is related to the expansion of sea ice in the North Atlantic Ocean and the subsequent southward migration of the westerly wind system(9). We further suggest that these hydrological changes amplified environmental change in western Europe at the onset of the Younger Dryas.					; Sachse, Dirk/D-3410-2012	Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Rach, Oliver/0000-0003-3547-2182; Sachse, Dirk/0000-0003-4207-0309													1752-0894	1752-0908				FEB	2014	7	2					109	112		10.1038/NGEO2053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NGEO2053													WOS:000331140800014
J	Cao, ZH; Belair, S; Zhang, DL				Cao, Zuohao; Belair, Stephane; Zhang, Da-Lin			The Impact of Incorporating the Air-Lake Interaction on Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts over Southern Ontario, Canada	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												A short-range regional, two-way coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice model has been recently developed in an attempt to improve, among other things, quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) over southern Ontario, Canada, by incorporating air-lake interaction over the Great Lakes region. Here, we attempt to 1) assess the impact of the air-lake coupling on daily QPFs, as verified against the Canadian Precipitation Analysis and independent observations, over southern Ontario during the period of June 2016-May 2017; and 2) diagnose major physical processes governing the QPF differences between the coupled and uncoupled models by relating precipitation to those processes at the air-water interface and above. Results indicate that the coupled model tends to reduce the area-averaged and monthly averaged daily QPF biases and standard deviations in 5 months of October, November, and December 2016, and April and May 2017, but increase and deteriorate precipitation biases during the summer months. Most of the deteriorations occur during the daytime, while improvements are observed during the nighttime (in 7 of 12 months). During the daytime, slight improvements appear in 2 months. A further diagnosis indicates that the daily QPF differences between the two models are highly correlated with the differences of their sensible and latent heat fluxes. The maximum (minimum) difference of sensible (latent) heat flux in August 2016 (December 2016) is in phase with the maximum (minimum) difference of the two-model daily QPFs. The daily QPF differences in the other months are also controlled by the differences of vertically integrated water vapor flux convergence, and surface temperature.

J	Rai, A; Bhattacharjee, A				Rai, Aditi; Bhattacharjee, Arindam			Molecular profiling of microbial community structure and their CAZymes via metagenomics, from Tsomgo lake in the Eastern Himalayas	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY												The present study is the first of its kind which is focused on Tsomgo lake, a high-altitude lake, located in the Eastern Himalayas of Sikkim. To get a major insight into the bacterial diversity, the shotgun sequencing was carried out in Illumina platform. Our results showed that both the samples TLSS1 (soil) and TLSW1 (water), had Proteobacteria as the most abundant taxa. Cluster of Orthologous group (COG) functional category of TLSS1 has 1,46,965 predicted functions. Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG) functional category of TLSW1 has 1,34,773 predicted functions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) functional category of TLSS1 has 1,76,825 predicted functions, most of the sequence fall in metabolism followed by Environmental information processing function. (KEGG) functional category of TLSW1 has 1,62,696 predicted functions and it follows the same pattern as TLSS1. Our studies also provide insight into the presence of distribution of different carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) present in Tsomgo lake. We have found that in case of both the samples TLSW1 and TLSS1, GlycosylTransferases were active followed by GlycosylHydrolase. The result found, represents for the first time very important findings related to the microbial diversity and the abundance of CAZymes in Tsomgo lake one of the pristine high-altitude lakes in Sikkim.

J	GarciaGil, LJ; Casamitjana, X; Abella, CA				GarciaGil, LJ; Casamitjana, X; Abella, CA			Comparative study of two meromictic basins of Lake Banyoles (Spain) with sulphur phototrophic bacteria	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The annual limnological dynamics of two meromictic basins of Lake Banyoles (C-III and C-IV) have been studied and compared on the basis of their physical, chemical and biological characters. Stability values calculated for both basins gave 865 g cm cm(-2) and 495 g cm cm(-2) for C-III and C-IV respectively. These values are in agreement with the fact that C-IV was almost completely mixed during winter. In this basin, during stratification, the monimolimnion increased in thickness as the stability increased. Isolation of the respective monimolimnia resulted in the development of anoxic conditions and the accumulation of sulphide in both C-III and C-IV, which favoured the development of dense populations of sulfur phototrophic bacteria. The purple sulphur bacterium Chromatium minus and the green sulphur bacterium Chlorobium phaeobacteroides were identified as the main components ol these photosynthetic populations. The different depths at which the O-2/H2S boundary was situated in both basins (and consequently the different light intensity reaching this zone) determined the growth of these bacteria. Light intensities at the chemocline of C-IV reached values up to 5% of surface incident light. In contrast, in C-III this variable was sensibly lower, with values depending on season and seldom reaching 1%. Phototrophic bacteria were consequently found earlier in C-IV than in C-III, where no significant concentrations were found until August. Finally stability is discussed as an important factor controlling chemical and biological dynamics in meromictic lakes.						casamitjana, xavier/0000-0003-1662-9076; Garcia-Gil, Jesus/0000-0002-5064-8361													0018-8158					FEB 23	1996	319	3					203	211		10.1007/BF00013733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013733													WOS:A1996UE14800005

Daily averages of absorption coefficients measured using six methods are compared at wavelengths of 456, 488, and 532 nm. Overall agreement was within 40% at 456 nm and improved with increasing wavelength to 25% at 532 nm. These absorption measurements were distributed over the final 9 days of the experiment, when bio-optical conditions in Lake Pend Oreille (as indexed by the beam attenuation coefficient c(p)(660) and chlorophyll a fluorescence profiles) were representative of those observed throughout the experiment. However, profiles of stimulated chlorophyll a fluorescence and beam transmission showed that bio-optical properties in the lake varied strongly on all time and space scales. Therefore environmental variability contributed significantly to deviations between daily mean absorption coefficients measured using the different techniques.																			2169-9275	2169-9291				JUL 15	1995	100	C7					13201	13220		10.1029/95JC00456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JC00456													WOS:A1995RJ35600008

Factors influencing the microextraction efficiency and determination, such as pH, microdrop volume, stirring rate, extraction time were evaluated. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the detection limits of the method are 2 and 90 pg mL(-1) for Cd and Pb, and the relative standards deviations for 0.5 ng mL(-1) Cd and 10 ng mL(-1) Pb are 11 and 12.8%. After 10 min of extraction, the enrichment factors for Cd and Pb are 118 and 90, respectively. The results for the determination of Cd and Pb in tap water, spring water, river water, pond water, lake water and spiked water samples demonstrate the accuracy, recovery and applicability of the method. An environmental water certified reference material (GSBZ 50009-88) was analyzed, and the determined values are in a good agreement with the certified values.

These lithologies capture a snapshot of dominantly peritidal environments during the Proterozoic. Early diagenetic chert preserves some of the most exceptional Proterozoic biosignatures in the form of microbial body fossils and mat textures. This fossiliferous and kerogenous chert formed in shallow marine environments, where chert nodules, layers, and lenses are often surrounded by and encased within carbonate deposits that themselves often contain kerogen and evidence of former microbial mats. Here, we review the record of biosignatures preserved in peritidal Proterozoic chert and chert-hosting carbonate and discuss this record in the context of experimental and environmental studies that have begun to shed light on the roles that microbes and organic compounds may have played in the formation of these deposits. Insights gained from these studies suggest temporal trends in microbial-environmental interactions and place new constraints on past environmental conditions, such as the concentration of silica in Proterozoic seawater, interactions among organic compounds and cations in seawater, and the influence of microbial physiology and biochemistry on selective preservation by silicification.

To examine their application under natural conditions, we sampled periphyton and invertebrate biomass in 12 Laurentian streams (Quebec) covering a range of total phosphorus from 5 to 60 mu g/L. We sampled at open and shaded sites to explore light limitation by canopy cover. Periphyton biomass measured as chlorophyll a or ash-free dry mass was not related to nutrient concentration or canopy cover. Only current velocity and depth explained a significant but relatively small fraction (10% and 20% respectively) of periphyton variation among sites. Grazer biomass and mean grazer size were positively correlated with phosphorus concentration, which explained 48% and 45% of their variation respectively; canopy cover was not significant. These results indicate that, at least in summer under stable flow, grazer biomass rather than periphyton biomass would increase along a nutrient gradient typical in Laurentian streams. The results suggest top-down control of periphyton biomass.																			0887-3593					DEC	1998	17	4					420	429		10.2307/1468363	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1468363													WOS:000079103000003

This survey was undertaken because it has been reported that thermally enriched water fosters the propagation of N. fowleri and, hence, increases the risk of infection to humans. Of 16 sites sampled during the summer of 2007, nine were found to be positive for N. fowleri by a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. However, total ameba counts, inclusive of N. fowleri, never exceeded 12/50 mL of lake water at any site. No correlation was obtained between the conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH of water and presence of N. fowleri. To date, cases of PAM have not been reported from this thermally enriched lake. It is postulated that predation by other protozoa and invertebrates, disturbance of the water surface from recreational boating activities, or the presence of bacterial or fungal toxins, maintain the number N. fowleri at a low level in Lake Anna.																			0932-0113	1432-1955				APR	2009	104	5					969	978		10.1007/s00436-008-1275-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-008-1275-y								19043740					WOS:000264495900003

We estimated the effects of climate change and possible future scenarios of agricultural changes on the phosphorus and nitrogen loading to the Baltic Sea from Finnish catchments. In the agricultural scenarios we assumed that the prices of agricultural products are among the primary drivers in the adaptation to climate change, as they affect the level of fertilization and the production intensity and volume and, hence, the modeled changes in gross nutrient loading from agricultural land. Optimal adaptation may increase production while supporting appropriate use of fertilization, resulting in low nutrient balance in the fields. However, a less optimal adaptation may result in higher nutrient balance and increased leaching. The changes in nutrient loading to the Baltic Sea were predicted by taking into account the agricultural scenarios in a nutrient loading model for Finnish catchments (VEMALA), which simulates runoff, nutrient processes, leaching and transport on land, in rivers and in lakes. We thus integrated the effects of climate change in the agricultural sector, nutrient loading in fields, natural background loading, hydrology and nutrient transport and retention processes.

Ten water samples were gathered from pit lakes, hand dug wells, boreholes and rivers. The collected samples were analysed for pH, EC, TDS, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- and PO42- in the laboratory using the standard methods. The results were compared with NDWQS and WHO standards. The physical parameters varied from pH (6.2-8.4), temp. (25.0-26.0 degrees C), electrical conductivity (4.9-102 mu S/cm) and total dissolved solids (25.5-214.2 mg/l). The analysed results revealed the mean concentration of cations and anions in the following order: Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ > Fe2+ and HCO3- > CO32- > SO42- > Cl-, respectively. Based on the standard limits, about 90% of the waters in the study area is suitable for domestic and drinking purposes. The Piper trilinear, Stiff and Durov diagrams showed that water samples from various locations fall into mixed CaCO32-+HCO3 type. Various ionic ratio plots show that water sources are from dissolution of minerals in the aquifer media. Geochemical parameters such as Cl-, Na+ and K+ show good interrelationship with positive factor loadings among the ions.																			2363-6203	2363-6211				DEC	2019	5	4					1893	1909		10.1007/s40808-019-00646-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-019-00646-3													WOS:000491437600055
J	EFFLER, SW				EFFLER, SW			CARBONATE EQUILIBRIA AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF INORGANIC CARBON IN SAGINAW BAY	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The spatial and temporal distribution of selected inorganic C equilibrium species is presented for 11 locations, representing the near surface waters of Saginaw Bay during 1974. CO2 and calcite equilibrium conditions are determined through solution of temperature and ionic strength adjusted equilibria and evaluated with respect to suitability as indicators of physical conditions and biological activity. The participation of inorganic C species in several chemical and biochemical reactions leads to the utility of these species in reflecting documented spatial and temporal trends in phytoplankton biomass, temperature, ionic strength, and ionic composition. Substantial seasonal variations in CO2 and calcite equilibrium conditions were observed at several locations throughout the bay. The magnitude of variation was greatest in the more productive areas of the bay, where extensive calcite supersaturation and CO2 undersaturation occurred. Maximum calcite saturation and minimum CO2 saturation were calculated for the warm, productive summer months. Transformations in chemical equilibria were mediated by both physical and biochemical factors, as reflected by seasonal changes in temperature and pH. The significance of photosynthetic activity was most pronounced in the inner bay and in shore zones; temperature became of greater relative importance where bay waters mixed with the open waters of Lake Huron. Strong correlations between time averaged data for chlorophyll a and CO2 (r = 0.97) and chlorophyll a and calcite saturation (r = 0.95) indicate the importance of photosynthetic activity in establishing the distribution of equilibrium conditions of inorganic C species.																			0380-1330						1984	10	1					3	14		10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71802-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71802-8													WOS:A1984SF29700002

I used recaptures and recoveries of leg-banded birds to test the influence of condition on the probability of survival and to compare site fidelity of American black ducks (Anas rubripes) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos) to the wetlands of southwestern Lake Erie. I live-trapped and banded 996 black chicks and 1, 168 mallards from October through January during 3 annual staging periods (1990-1993) on Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Ohio, USA. Ducks, were aged, sexed, and weighed; total body length, wring chord, culmen, and tarsus also were measured to compute condition indices. I used multiple-logistic regression models to test influences of condition, date of initial capture, and species on the probabilities of recapture and band recovery for each age-sex class, Black ducks were more likely to be recaptured than mallards in all age-sex classes within a season and during subsequent seasons. Body condition had a positive influence on recaptures during subsequent field seasons for adults. Analyses of within-season band recovery for adult males of both species indicated that birds with lower condition were more likely to be harvested. The opposite relationships between condition and the probability of recapture and direct recovery support the contention that poor body condition increased vulnerability to hunting for adult males.																			0022-541X					JAN	2002	66	1					153	161		10.2307/3802881	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3802881													WOS:000173934100016

All samples were analysed for major and trace elements by using ICP-AES and ICP-MS When the oxidation front in the tailings is moving downwards, metals released by weathering in this low-pH environment are to a large extent retained secondarily in the tailings below the oxidation front and do not reach the groundwater, except in areas where the oxidation front is situated close to the groundwater table. Vertical flow of precipitation water contaminated with metals released by sulphide oxidation is, thus, not the major explanation for groundwater contamination. Instead, contamination occurs when the advancing oxidation front pushes the secondary enrichments of metals ahead to meet the groundwater table and the met, als are released to the groundwater. The release of metals is caused by desorption due to the low pH in this environment. Areas of the tailings deposit with shallow groundwater table are at present the main sources of metal release. There is a seasonal variation in the composition of groundwater, particularly shallow groundwater. This is caused by changing levels of the groundwater table. Rising groundwater table results in outflush of metals in areas where the groundwater reaches secondarily retained metals. A steady trend with rising groundwater table after snowmelt results in a larger proportion of contaminated water in shallow groundwater, which decreases during the autumn. Concentration peaks of Cu and other metals in shallow groundwater may be the result of small, rapid rises of the groundwater table due to strong precipitation, superimposed on the general seasonal trend.																			1103-5897	2000-0863				SEP	2001	123		3				153	162																WOS:000171829100003

While most proxy records that support this hypothesis are from regions outside the Tibetan Plateau (such as from the Chinese Loess Plateau), detailed paleoclimatic information for the plateau itself during that time has yet remained elusive. Here we present a temporally highly resolved (similar to 500 years) sedimentological record from the Qaidam Basin situated on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau that shows pronounced glacial-interglacial climate variability during the interval from 2.7 to 2.1 Ma. Glacial (interglacial) intervals are generally characterized by coarser (finer) grain size, minima (maxima) in organic matter content, and maxima (minima) in carbonate content. Comparison of our results with Earth's orbital parameters and proxy records from the Chinese Loess Plateau suggests that the observed climate fluctuations were mainly driven by changes in the Siberian High/East Asian winter monsoon system as a response to the iNHG. They are further proposed to be enhanced by the topography of the Tibetan Plateau and its impact on the position and intensity of the westerlies.					; Koutsodendris, Andreas/G-8966-2013; Kaboth-Bahr, Stefanie/ABF-7573-2021	Dewald, Nico/0000-0001-9726-1941; Koutsodendris, Andreas/0000-0003-4236-7508; Lu, Yin/0000-0002-9568-7428; Appel, Erwin/0000-0002-0831-2936													2572-4517	2572-4525				MAY	2020	35	5							UNSP e2020PA003864	10.1029/2020PA003864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020PA003864													WOS:000537787100008

Optimized and adapted hydropower management considering glacier shrinkage scenarios in the Swiss Alps	DAMS AND RESERVOIRS UNDER CHANGING CHALLENGES					International Symposium on Dams and Reservoirs Under Changing Challenges During the 79th Annual Meeting of the International-Commission-on-Large-Dams (ICOLD)	JUN 01, 2011	Lucerne, SWITZERLAND	Int Commiss Large Dams, KWO, STUCKY, Marti Holding AG Bauunternehmungen, BKW FMB Energie AG, Swiss Confederat, Swiss Fed Off Energy, POYRY, Huggenberger AG, EWZ Energie, ALPIQ, REPOWER, Ofima Maggia Kraftwerke AG, Grande Dixence, Holcim, KWZ Kraftwerke Zervreila AG, FMV, EnAlpin, SIG, SFMCP, Kraftwerke KHR Hinterrhein AG, EKWOEE, ACE, IM				Global warming is an alarming reality and likely leads to an increase of multiple pressures on socio-economic systems. However, in high-mountain regions it might also become an opportunity to adapt existing hydropower schemes and future projects to this new reality. In the Alps, the melting of glaciers first produces over the near future an increase of the average annual discharge depending on glacier and catchment characteristics, especially during the summer season. Nevertheless after a certain time, significant decrease of runoff related to glacier melting must be considered for hydropower management. Moreover, the melted glaciers free new alpine valley areas, which have a potential for the construction of new dams and reservoirs. The opportunity to build new dams and hydropower plants downstream of retreating glaciers is studied systematically in Switzerland within the framework of the National Research Program on Sustainable Water Management (NRP61) under the project " New lakes in deglaciating high-mountain areas: climate-related development and challenges for sustainable use (NELAK)". The developed methodology is based on several prediction models. Regional climate models provide spatially distributed rainfall and temperature scenarios for the next 50 years. The RS3.0 CLIMATE rainfall-runoff hydrological model computes the glacier evolution, the river discharge at the outlet of the catchment area as well as the hydropower production of the new lakes. Another model (GlabTop) is used to predict the future topography and geomorphology underneath the melting glaciers, in order to define the optimal locations of the future dams and reservoirs. As a case study the Corbassi re glacier near the Mauvoisin reservoir in Valais is presented. The opportunity of the construction of a new dam and a hydropower plant is studied, as well as its economic benefit and its impacts on the environment. The result of the case study provides a basis to assess the potential of investing in such projects to ensure the Swiss hydroelectricity production also in future.																					978-0-203-80409-4; 978-0-415-68267-1				2011							497	508																WOS:000340662500060

Changes in dissolved organic material determine exposure of stream benthic communities to UV-B radiation and heavy metals: implications for climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Changes in regional climate in the Rocky Mountains over the next 100 years are expected to have significant effects on biogeochemical cycles and hydrological processes. In particular, decreased discharge and lower stream depth during summer when ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the highest combined with greater photo-oxidation of dissolved organic materials (DOM) will significantly increase exposure of benthic communities to UVR. Communities in many Rocky Mountain streams are simultaneously exposed to elevated metals from abandoned mines, the toxicity and bioavailability of which are also determined by DOM. We integrated field surveys of 19 streams (21 sites) along a gradient of metal contamination with microcosm and field experiments conducted in Colorado, USA, and New Zealand to investigate the influence of DOM on bioavailability of heavy metals and exposure of benthic communities to UVR. Spatial and seasonal variation in DOM were closely related to stream discharge and significantly influenced heavy metal uptake in benthic organisms. Qualitative and quantitative changes in DOM resulting from exposure to sunlight increased UV-B (290-320 nm) penetration and toxicity of heavy metals. Results of microcosm experiments showed that benthic communities from a metal-polluted stream were tolerant of metals, but were more sensitive to UV-B than communities from a reference stream. We speculate that the greater sensitivity of these communities to UV-B resulted from costs associated with metal tolerance. Exclusion of UVR from 12 separate Colorado streams and from outdoor stream microcosms in New Zealand increased the abundance of benthic organisms (mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies) by 18% and 54%, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering changes in regional climate and UV-B exposure when assessing the effects of local anthropogenic stressors.

Adjustment of radar-based precipitation estimates for Great Lakes hydrologic modeling	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												For the Great Lakes region, radar-based precipitation estimates provide valuable data for over-lake areas and may help to improve mean areal precipitation estimates over land areas, particularly where precipitation gauges are sparse. To this end, potential biases in daily radar-based precipitation data are evaluated for several Great Lakes watersheds. Statistical analysis of gauge data (MAP) and radar-based data (MAPX) for the period 1996-2004 shows that, except for some summer months, MAPX values were consistently lower than MAP values. Possible reasons for this underestimation include truncation error, beam blockage and overshoot, and variability in radar reflectivity-surface precipitation relationships. Application of the precipitation data to continuous simulation and forecasting models of the Great Lakes shows that the observed biases are generally magnified by the hydrology models, i.e., even larger discrepancies are observed between simulated runoff values generated with MAP and MAPX inputs. Discrepancies in observed runoff and simulated runoff with, MAPX inputs are deemed unacceptable for hydrologic prediction, and procedures for adjusting the MAPX data are developed and verified.																			1084-0699					MAY-JUN	2007	12	3					298	305		10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2007)12:3(298)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2007)12:3(298)													WOS:000245794800007

Design: Prospective cohort study with limited follow-up. Retrospective analysis of coronial data. Setting: Primary and tertiary referral toxicology centre covering Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, Australia, 1987-1992. Results: There were 1969 admissions after ingestion of 3724 substances (2424 prescription drugs and 1300 non-prescription items). The coroner investigated 83 drug-related deaths. Only 12 of these people presented to hospital and, for most of these, death was inevitable at presentation. The most frequently ingested substances were benzodiazepines, alcohol, paracetamol, antidepressants, neuroleptics and anticonvulsants. Since 1980, the percentage of self-poisonings involving benzodiazepines has fallen, while it has risen for those involving antidepressants. Over 50% of deaths were due to tricyclic antidepressants or opioid analgesics. Conclusions: As death usually occurs out of hospital, interventions to decrease mortality from self-poisoning must focus on prevention, and targeting drugs that are frequently taken or frequently lethal in overdose. Consideration should be given to the use of antidepressants that are safer in overdose. The use of antidepressants, barbiturates or chloral hydrate as sedatives should be discouraged.

E18 degrees 50') in the mountain region of northern Sweden, within the recently established Climate Impacts Research Centre (CIRC), A systematic sample of 850 circular plots with 10- or 20-metres radius was surveyed during the summer of 1997, The test site covered all vegetation types surrounding the Lake Tornetrask, e.g. alpine meadows, willow and mountain birch forests (Betula pubescens spp. tortuosa). At each plot 35 vegetation and ground parameters were measured or estimated. An initial analysis of the spectral distance between different vegetation types is presented. The distance measure used was Mahalanobis distance, applied on Landsat TM band 3, 4, 5, and 7, The results from this initial analysis indicate that it could be possible to discriminate mountain birch vegetation from other vegetation types.																					82-7542-040-7				1998							575	578																WOS:000078443800141

Despite numerous dietary studies, however, quantitative evaluations of impact in European river systems are scarce. Here, we investigate the impact of tubenose (Proterorhinus semilunaris, Heckel 1837) and round (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) gobies on macroinvertebrates in a lowland river (River Dyje, Czech Republic) by allowing and preventing gobiid access to rip-rap substrate naturally colonised by invertebrates at two sites (Site 1-tubenose goby only, Site 2-tubenose and round gobies). Gobies had a negative impact on invertebrates at both sites, with overall invertebrate density reduced by 15% (ca. 17.9 g m(-2) per year) at Site 1 and 36% (ca. 23.6 g m(-2) per year) at Site 2. Both species showed increased impact in summer and ingested larger invertebrates preferentially, resulting in an overall reduction in invertebrate body size. Tubenose gobies had a significant impact on Annelida, Gastropoda, Crustacea and Ephemeroptera nymphs, while tubenose and round goby together impacted Annelida, Bivalvia (Dreissena), Gastropoda, Crustacea, Ephemeroptera nymphs, Odonata nymphs and Chironomidae larvae. Our results confirm that round and tubenose gobies can have a significant negative impact on aquatic invertebrate density and community composition.

Influence of Climate Change on Productivity of American White Pelicans, Pelecanus erythrorhynchos	PLOS ONE												In the past decade, severe weather and West Nile virus were major causes of chick mortality at American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) colonies in the northern plains of North America. At one of these colonies, Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge in North Dakota, spring arrival by pelicans has advanced approximately 16 days over a period of 44 years (1965-2008). We examined phenology patterns of pelicans and timing of inclement weather through the 44-year period, and evaluated the consequence of earlier breeding relative to weather-related chick mortality. We found severe weather patterns to be random through time, rather than concurrently shifting with the advanced arrival of pelicans. In recent years, if nest initiations had followed the phenology patterns of 1965 (i.e., nesting initiated 16 days later), fewer chicks likely would have died from weather-related causes. That is, there would be fewer chicks exposed to severe weather during a vulnerable transition period that occurs between the stage when chicks are being brooded by adults and the stage when chicks from multiple nests become part of a thermally protective creche.					; Igl, Lawrence/ABG-5135-2021	Igl, Lawrence/0000-0003-0530-7266; 													1932-6203					JAN 8	2014	9	1							e83430	10.1371/journal.pone.0083430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083430								24416165					WOS:000329862500047

Salt-wedge propagation in a Mediterranean micro-tidal river mouth	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The dynamics of a seasonally formed salt-wedge propagating along the micro-tidal channel of Strymon River estuary, Northern Greece, and its consequences on river water quality, are thoroughly studied through intensive sampling campaigns. The wedge is developed at the downstream river part, under the summer limited freshwater discharge conditions (Q < 30 m(3)/s). The geometric features of the wedge (length and thickness) appeared directly related to Strymon River discharge. A maximum intrusion length of 4.7 km along Strymon River estuary was observed under minimum river discharge of almost 6 m(3)/s. Relations produced from in situ data illustrate that limited river flow expands the wedge horizontally, reducing its vertical dimension, while higher flows lead to increased wedge thickness. Estuarine flushing time ranges between 0.2 and 1.5 days, exponentially dependent on Strymon River discharge. Wedge velocities depicted tidal asymmetry between tidal phases, with consistent inward motion, even under the ebb tidal stage. Strong vertical stratification prevails throughout the tidal cycle, proving the limited vertical mixing between the two layers, although higher interfacial stresses are produced in ebb. Bottom topography plays an interesting role in wedge propagation, as the presence of an underwater sill either prevents saline intrusion during flood or isolates the front of the wedge from its core at the ebb. Ecological consequences of salt-wedge propagation in Strymon River estuary are the frequent evidence of bottom hypoxic conditions and the increased TSS levels, leading to the occurrence of a turbidity maximum at the tip of the salt-wedge. Higher BOD and ammonium levels were mostly observed at the river end, associated to point and non-point pollution sources. Nitrates and silicates were found associated with freshwater fluxes, while ammonia levels were related to saline intrusions. The reduced phosphorus freshwater fluxes, resulting from phosphorus uptake at the upstream reservoir (Kerkini Lake) and the increased bottom turbidity induced by the salt-wedge seem responsible for the limited chlorophyll-a levels along Strymon River estuary.

Smaller char were benthic and fed on chironomids whereas medium-sized char were living pelagically in summer, feeding on zooplankton. Larger char moved randomly over the strata, and cannibalism increased in importance with increasing size. Within each size group there was a great variation in age. All three groups contained spawners but spawning frequency variated between groups. Smaller forms probably transform to larger ones with correlated shifts in diet and periods of somatic growth only. We hypothesize that the ecological forms of the Tasersuaq population may represent an early step towards speciation. This view bridges the opposing interpretations of char populations presented in the literature considering different forms as belonging to either a common gene pool or to reproductively isolated sibling species.

Thad			MICROCYSTIN SHOWS THRESHOLDS AND HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE WITH PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES AT LAKE FAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS, MAY THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2020	JOURNAL OF THE ASABE												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwaters are a global concern, and research has focused on the nutrient drivers of cyanobacterial growth and toxin production. We explored the importance of nutrients on sustained cyanobacterial HABs producing measurable microcystin at Lake Fayetteville, Arkansas, USA. The specific objectives were to (1) quantify sediment phosphorus (P) flux and estimate potential equilibrium P concentrations (EPC0) in July 2020, (2) assess water quality conditions in the lake from March through September 2020, and (3) evaluate physicochemical thresholds (or change points, CPs) and hierarchical structure with total microcystin concentrations. The sediments were a potential P source under both oxic and anoxic conditions, and the SRP concentrations in the lake water were continuously less than the EPC0 estimated for bottom sediment (similar to 0.03 mg L-1); sediments are likely a potential P source for cyanobacterial HABs at Lake Fayetteville. The physicochemical changes at Lake Fayetteville over the 2020 growing season were typical of small, hyper-eutrophic reservoirs, with low biomass in winter when nutrient supply was greatest and the greatest cyanobacterial growth and microcystin toxin as nutrient supply diminished into the growing season. Microcystin concentrations were elevated above 1 mu g L-1 from mid-June through mid-August 2020, and most physicochemical parameters in this study showed thresh-olds or change points with microcystin. Hierarchical structure existed with total microcystin concentrations, showing the potential importance of cyanobacterial biomass, N supply, and total P on elevated microcystin. Nutrients and algal pigment raw fluorescence explained 83% of the variation in total microcystin concentrations at Lake Fayetteville during the 2020 growing season. Nutrients (both N and P) from external and internal sources are likely important drivers of these blooms and toxicity at Lake Fayetteville.

A ubiquitous and diverse methanogenic community drives microbial methane cycling in eutrophic coastal sediments	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Coastal areas contribute over 75% of global marine methane emissions, a proportion predicted to increase with anthropogenic eutrophication and deoxygenation. Prolonged low oxygen and high organic matter input can disrupt the methane cycle, favoring methane production over oxidation. However, factors influencing this imbalance remain unclear. Here, we show that methanogenesis dominates microbial methane cycling in the anoxic sediments of eutrophic coastal marine Lake Grevelingen (The Netherlands) after summer stratification. A shallow sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ; 5-15 cm depth) was observed, with high methane concentrations below. Methane was produced in all investigated layers, while methane oxidation was restricted to the narrow SMTZ. Amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and incubations revealed a metabolically and phylogenetically diverse methanogenic community with niche separation, and methylotrophic methanogenesis prevalent in all layers. Two clades of ANME archaea, ANME-2a/b and ANME-3, were restricted to a narrow zone together with their putative syntrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria, coinciding with the observed methane oxidation activity. Our results suggest that eutrophication and deoxygenation will further contribute to rising methane emissions, tilting the microbial methane cycle toward increased methanogenesis, and decreasing the efficiency of the microbial methane filter. Eutrophication favors microbial methane production over methane removal in seasonally anoxic marine basin.

Limnological characteristics of Lake of the Ozarks (Missouri, USA): long-term assessment following formation of a reservoir series	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Jones JR, Obrecht DV, Thorpe AP. 2022. Limnological characteristics of Lake of the Ozarks (Missouri, USA): long-term assessment following formation of a reservoir series. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Impoundment of Truman Lake in 1980 on the Osage River, above Lake of the Ozarks (LOTO), created a reservoir series. This analysis details the changes and processes over the ensuing 35 yr (1980-2014) in this large impoundment dominated by a longitudinal gradient along the mainstem. Temporal variation was determined by hydrology; seasonal mean total phosphorus (TP) ranged between 12 and 58 mu g/L at the near-dam location, and hydrologic flushing during summer explained 82% of this variation. After dam closure, mineral suspended solids, attributed to channel scouring of erodible materials in the tailwater reach, declined over time, with a 50% reduction near the dam. Concurrently, organic suspended solids increased by 1 to 4%/yr in mid-reach locations, which indicates greater autotrophic production. Compared with other Missouri reservoirs, algal chlorophyll (Chl) averaged 1.6 times the value predicted from TP. Ratios of Chl:TP have increased over past decades concurrent with an increase in organic suspended solids and expansion of the ultraplankton (<11 mu m) fraction of total Chl. Warm and dry conditions are associated with an increase in Chl in the ultra fraction, suggesting climate influence. A comparison with data collected prior to the closure of Truman Dam (1976-1979) provides incontrovertible evidence that light transmission has improved, and both Chl and Chl:TP have increased in LOTO. Formation of a reservoir series resulted in immediate and long-term changes in this major impoundment.

J	Zhan, YC; Buchan, A; Chen, F				Zhan, Yuanchao; Buchan, Alison; Chen, Feng			Novel N4 Bacteriophages Prevail in the Cold Biosphere	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Coliphage N4 is a lytic bacteriophage discovered nearly half a century ago, and it was considered to be a "genetic orphan" until very recently, when several additional N4-like phages were discovered to infect nonenteric bacterial hosts. Interest in this genus of phages is stimulated by their unique genetic features and propagation strategies. To better understand the ecology of N4-like phages, we investigated the diversity and geographic patterns of N4-like phages by examining 56 Chesapeake Bay viral communities, using a PCR-clone library approach targeting a diagnostic N4-like DNA polymerase gene. Many new lineages of N4-like phages were found in the bay, and their genotypes shift from the lower to the upper bay. Interestingly, signature sequences of N4-like phages were recovered only from winter month samples, when water temperatures were below 4 degrees C. An analysis of existing metagenomic libraries from various aquatic environments supports the hypothesis that N4-like phages are most prolific in colder waters. In particular, a high number of N4-like phages were detected in Organic Lake, Antarctica, a cold and hypersaline system. The prevalence of N4-like phages in the cold biosphere suggests these viruses possess yet-to-be-determined mechanisms that facilitate lytic infections under cold conditions.					; Chen, Feng/P-3088-2014; Buchan, Alison/A-9401-2010	Buchan, Alison/0000-0001-7420-985X; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				AUG	2015	81	15					5196	5202		10.1128/AEM.00832-15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00832-15								26025897					WOS:000357668600033

A second tephra isochron for the Younger Dryas period in northern Europe: The Abernethy Tephra	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Visible and non-visible (cryptotephra) volcanic ash layers are increasingly being used to underpin the chronology and high-precision correlation of sequences dating to the last glacial interglacial transition (WIT). As the number of sediment records analysed for tephra content rises, and methodological developments permit the detection, extraction and chemical analysis of increasingly scantily represented glass shard concentrations, greater complexity in shard count profiles is revealed. Here we present new evidence from sites in Scotland, and review published evidence from sites elsewhere in NW Europe, that indicate complexity in the eruptive history of Katla volcano during the mid-Younger Dryas and Early Holocene. We propose evidence for a previously-overlooked tephra isochron, here named the Abernethy Tephra, which is consistently found to lie close to the Younger Dryas/Holocene transition. It has a major-element chemical composition indistinguishable from that of the Vedde Ash, which was erupted from the Katla volcano at 12,121 +/- 114 cal a BP. The new data suggest that Katla may have erupted again between 11,720-11,230 cal a BP and the subsequent ash fall increases the potential to assess environmental response to Holocene warming across north and west Europe.

J	Bezrukova, EV; Belov, AV; Orlova, LA				Bezrukova, Elena V.; Belov, Alexey V.; Orlova, Lyubov A.			Holocene vegetation and climate variability in North Pre-Baikal region, East Siberia, Russia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The paper presents the first reconstructions of vegetation and climate of the North Pre-Baikal region covering the last 9000 years based on detailed pollen records from peatlands. Recorded major changes in pollen spectra and vegetation are demonstrated to correlate with large-scale climatic events, such as the regional climatic optimum ca. 9000-6800 BP, termination of the optimum ca. 7000-6500 BP, and Neoglacial cooling culminated ca. 3000-2000 BP. The most warm and wet climate existed about 9000-6800 BP, the interval being referred to as the regional Holocene optimum. At that time, vegetation was dominated by dark coniferous forests of Abies sibirica, Picea obovata with Pinus sibirica. Since 6800 BP, the dark coniferous forests gave way to light coniferous ones (Pinus sylvestris and Lath) in response to gradual decrease of precipitation and summer temperatures to today's values, agreeing well with earlier obtained data. The new records suggest the cold boreal plant communities are highly sensitive to climatic changes. Detailed dating of the sequences would facilitate inter- and intra-regional correlations of the obtained records and reconstructed events. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Their potential, however, for such reconstruction is commonly limited by difficulties associated with their absolute age control. Attempts to date such deposits via uranium series techniques have been complicated by their chemically open behaviour. Here we describe an alternative approach to date tufa deposits associated with ephemeral saline lake basins from the Southern High Plains, USA. We have optically dated sand grains of a mixed aeolian/fluvial (spring fed) origin as the integrating dosimeter. We assume that the grains are fully resetting prior to their incorporation into the tufa deposits and employ a time-dependent disequilibrium dosimetric model to account for the build-up of uranium series daughter products. The approach was applied to a set of four samples with known stratigraphic association. We obtained stratigraphically sensible optical ages ranging from 78 +/- 8 to 56 +/- 4 ka. These data are consistent with existing palaeoenvironmental models of regional recharge. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Both in situ primary production and biomass (chlorophyll a) of fractionated phytoplankton (< 64 .mu.m, < 25 .mu.m and < 10 .mu.m) were studied in 10 Canadian Shield lakes to elucidate the spatial and temporal variability of the contributon of size fractions to the biomass and primary production of the phytoplankton community. Mean summer biomass and production of each size fraction varied significantly between lakes. Within lakes, temporal variation was low for biomass but great for production. However, temporal variation can be considered of minor importance during the sampling period, as compared to the spatial variation between lakes. Algae from the < 10 .mu.m size fraction were the most important in biomass (41-65%) and production (23-69%). The temporal trends for both phytoplankton variables thus generally followed closely that of the < 10 .mu.m size fraction. Among the physical, chemical and morphometric variables of the studied lakes, water transparency (Secchi disk), total phosphorus, lake volume, lake area, and mean depth gave the best correlations with phytoplankton variables.

Green manure, as a high-quality biological fertilizer source with rich nutrient content, is of great significance for enhancing the soil quality and establishing a healthy farmland ecosystem. However, there are few studies on the effects of different green manures on the soil nutrient levels, enzyme activities, and soil bacterial community composition in the rice-wheat rotation areas in southern China. Thus, we planted Chinese milk vetch (MV; Astragalus sinicus L.), light leaf vetch (LV; Vicia villosa var.), common vetch (CV; Vicia sativa L.), crimson clover (CC; Trifolium incarnatum L.), Italian ryegrass (RG; Lolium multiflorum L.), and winter fields without any crops as a control in the Taihu Lake area of Jiangsu. The soil samples collected after tilling and returning the green manure to the field during the bloom period were used to analyze the effects of the different green manures on the soil nutrient content, enzyme activity, and the structural composition of the bacterial community. This analysis was conducted using chemical methods and high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that the green manure returned to the field increased the soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), sucrose (SC), urease (UE), and neutral phosphatase (NEP) contents compared to the control. They increased by 1.55% to 10.06%, 0.26% to 9.31%, 20.95% to 28.42%, 20.66% to 57.79%, 12.38% to 37.94%, 3.11% to 58.19%, 6.49% to 32.99%, and 50.0% to 80.36%, respectively. In addition, the green manure field increased the relative abundance of the genera Proteobacteria and Haliangium while decreasing the relative abundance of Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, SBR1031, and Anaeromyxobacter in the soil bacteria. Both the number of ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) and alpha-diversity of the soil bacterial communities were higher compared to the control, and the beta-diversity varied significantly among the treatments. Alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen and neutral phosphatase had the greatest influence on the soil bacterial community diversity, with alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen being the primary soil factor affecting the soil bacterial community composition. Meanwhile, the results of the principal component analysis showed that the MV treatment had the most significant impact on soil improvement. Our study provides significant insights into the sustainable management of the soil quality in rice-wheat rotations. It identifies MV as the best choice among the green manure crops for improving the soil quality, offering innovative solutions for reducing chemical fertilizer dependence and promoting ecological sustainability.

In this study, organic matter cycle and its impact on distribution of trace metals in the marine lake Mir, located on Dugi Otok Island, in the central part of the eastern Adriatic Sea, was investigated for the first time. Studied marine lake is small, isolated, shallow basin, with limited communication with the open sea. Intense spatial and seasonal variations of organic matter, dissolved and particulate (DOC, POC), and dissolved trace metals concentrations in the water column of the Lake are governed predominantly by natural processes. Enhanced oxygen consumption in the Lake during summer season, high DOC and POC concentrations and low redox potential result in occasional occurrence of anoxic conditions in the bottom layers with appearance of sulfur species. Speciation modeling showed that dissolved trace metals Cu, Pb and Zn, are mostly bound to organic matter, while Cd. Co and Ni are present predominantly as free ions and inorganic complexes. Trace metals removal from the water column and their retention in the sediment was found to depend on the nature of the relationship between specific metal and organic or inorganic phases, sulfides, Fe-oxyhydroxydes or biogenic calcite. The above is reflected in the composition of the sediments, which are, in addition to influence of karstic background and bathymetry of the basin, significantly affected by accumulation of detritus at the bottom of the Lake.

Fish samples were obtained by means of electro-shocker, water analyses were performed on the field on water samples taken every month throughout a year from four stations by using ready made kits. Physico-chernical data were measured as following (minimum-maximum respectively); water temperature (13.0-29.8 degrees C), pH (7.74-8.60), conductivity(502-837 mS cm(-1)), chloride (0.1-1.8 mg L(-1)), dissolved oxygen (4.05-9.80 mg L(-1)), nitrate (0.12-2.80 mg L(-1)), total hardness (13.5-19.0 degrees dH) and phosphate (ALA-0.05 mg L(-1)). The physico-chemical data were evaluated and the water quality classes of the chosen stations in Bereket hydro-electric plant dam lakes were determined. By evaluating the physico-chemical data, according to the Water Pollution Control Regulation, the water quality classes of the chosen stations in Bereket hydro-electric plant dam lakes were determined as; 1.

J	POULTON, DJ				POULTON, DJ			TRACE CONTAMINANT STATUS OF HAMILTON HARBOR	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water and sediment samples collected from Hamilton Harbour in 1982 were analyzed for heavy metals and trace organic contaminants in order to obtain an improved knowledge of the concentrations of these substances and the frequency of violation of guidelines and objectives. In the harbor water, copper exceed objectives two-thirds of the time, while other metals exceeded objectives less frequently. Higher concentrations were found in the southeast part of the harbor near the major industrial and muncipal discharges. As a result of mildly reducing conditions at the sediment-water interface, higher concentrations of manganese were found in bottom waters during late summer; however, input of dissolved oxygen from Lake Ontario prevented highly reducing conditions that would have allowed iron release from the sediments. PCBs and BHCs are found in both the water and sediments, with the distribution of .alpha.-BHC suggesting that no local source exists for this compound. Loadings of heavy metals and organic compounds from Hamilton Harbour to Lake Ontario are small, compared with either the Niagara River or atmospheric sources.																			0380-1330						1987	13	2					193	201		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71642-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71642-6													WOS:A1987J558000009

In order to increase knowledge about the fish fauna and to infer their distributional pattern within the igapo forest, we sought to describe and compare the diversity and composition of the fish assemblages present in this habitat with the open water area of the lakes and along the rise and fall of waters. Samplings were carried out in four lakes of the Anavilhanas National Park in the months of April and September of 2014, and February of 2015, by means of gillnets. In order to investigate the structure of the igapo and open water assemblages, the rarefaction curve and a Venn diagram and the diversity indices were used, the results of which were tested using the Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Subsequently, a perMANOVA test was applied to test the hypothesis of absence of spatial and seasonal effects on species composition. A total of 931 individuals were collected, distributed in 4 orders, 20 families, 48 genera and 65 species. In the igapo forest, 650 individuals and 62 species were collected, and in the open water 281 individuals and 37 species. The igapo forest presented high richness, abundance, diversity and variability in the composition of the species between periods when compared to the open water of the lakes, moreover, the two habitats have quite different ichthyofaunistic compositions. Additionally, the absence of the effect of fluvial processes was seen on the igapo forest, demonstrated by a high homogeneity in the abundance of the individuals, species richness and biomass of this habitat. Thus, our study demonstrates the importance of the igapo forest in maintaining the abundance and diversity of the ichthyofauna present in black waters of Central Amazonia.					; Loebens, Sara/AAJ-9859-2020; Freitas, Carlos/F-1752-2014; Freitas, Carlos/I-5386-2012; Yamamoto, Kedma/AAE-6610-2021	Yamamoto, Kedma/0000-0002-1026-2712; Freitas, Carlos/0000-0001-5406-0998; FARIAS, ELETUZA/0000-0002-9266-5266; de Castro Loebens, Sara/0000-0002-0778-7382													0046-9939	1678-2305					2019	45	1							e432	10.20950/1678-2305.2019.45.1.432	http://dx.doi.org/10.20950/1678-2305.2019.45.1.432													WOS:000456338300008

In order to weak the adverse effects of micro-polluted water on natural water, this new-type of compound pattern forms a landscape-designed ecological barrier. After 5 months experiment, results show that the landscape-designed ecological barrier has a better removal of pollutants. The removal rates of COD, TN and TP respectively reached 65.2% similar to 73.6%, 62.5% similar to 66.0% and 70.0% similar to 80.0%. And the effluent quality can reach III - IV water-quality of environmental quality standards for surface water(GB3838-2002). In Autumn, the concentration of CODCr, TN and TP in effluent sustain at IV water-quality of environmental quality standards for surface water(GB3838-2002), and at the same time create artificial landscape water with environmental aesthetic and ornamental value, bring the benefit of water resources as well as positive ecological environment effects into full play synthetically.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-127-2				2011	250-253	1-4					3941	3944		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.250-253.3941	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.250-253.3941													WOS:000304018401358

Important influent-water quality parameters at freshwater production sites in two salmon producing countries	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING					Conference on Design, Loading and Water Quality in Recirculating Systems for Salmonids held at the 4th Aquacultural-Engineering-Society Issues Forum	JUL 23-24, 2008	Roanoke, VA	Aquacultural Engn Soc				Further growth in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture production is expected, and as a response to limited freshwater resources, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are increasingly applied in smolt production. Knowledge of the general composition and quality of inlet-water is important for designing water-treatment to obtain optimal water quality in both flow-through and RAS systems. Based on water quality surveys in Norway (96 water sources, 1999-2006) and Chile (120 water sources, 2006-2008) inlet-water quality was evaluated. Norwegian smolt production is characterized by almost exclusively utilizing surface waters as inlet-water sources, with lake inlets constituting 88% and river inlets 12%. This results in large seasonal variations in both temperature, and inlet-water quality. In Chile, production is based on inlet-water from groundwater wells (32%), natural springs (40%) and rivers (28%). Norwegian inlet-water quality shows significantly lower pH and buffering capacity. The content of total organic carbon and total nitrogen is generally higher in Norway, while the levels the main metals of concern, aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe), show large between-site variability in both countries. In low pH waters in Norway, the concentration of inorganic (labile) aluminium exceeds recommended level (10 mu g/L) in 15% of the samples. The Norwegian database documents highly variable production intensity in smolt production. The measured levels of carbon dioxide (CO(2), 11.6 +/- 6.2 mg/L) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN. 499 +/- 485 mu g N/L) (mean +/- SD), exceed current legislative recommendations in 30% and 10.5% of the cases, respectively. RAS technology has the potential to improve a variable water quality if it proves reliable for the time intervals and production volumes needed. Thus, if necessary adjustments in water treatment to the local water quality are implemented, RAS production may well constitute a substantial part of smolt production in the future.

J	Wang, H; Liu, JG				Wang, Hui; Liu, Junguo			Reservoir Operation Incorporating Hedging Rules and Operational Inflow Forecasts	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Reservoir operation incorporating a na < ve hedging strategy and operational inflow forecasting is studied in this paper. Gridded precipitation forecasts from climate model, ECHAM4.5, are used as potential predictors for reservoir inflow forecasting. In building a statistical predicting model, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the regression model. Performance evaluation indices, including water supply satisfaction ratio, environmental flow satisfaction ratio, end-of-month storage satisfaction ratio and flood prevention capacity index, are defined. Three scenarios where a na < ve hedging operation rule under different set of reservoir inflow are investigated. These are evaluated for a water supply reservoir, Falls Lake Reservoir, at Neuse River in the southeast United State. Reservoir simulation with monthly average inflow serves as a benchmark. The utility of operational inflow forecasts is quantified by the improvements of performance indices. Results show that reservoir operation under perfect inflow forecasting has the highest values for most indices. Compared to climatology, operational inflow forecasts result in higher index values. Among all the performance indices, end-of-month storage satisfaction ratio is the most sensitive index to inflow information. Limitation of this study and further work is also discussed.					; Liu, Junguo/B-3021-2012	Liu, Junguo/0000-0002-5745-6311; 													0920-4741					MAR	2013	27	5					1427	1438		10.1007/s11269-012-0246-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-012-0246-3													WOS:000315265400016
J	Ayliffe, D; Williams, MAJ; Sheldon, F				Ayliffe, D; Williams, MAJ; Sheldon, F			Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of early-Holocene gastropods from Wadi Mansurab, north-central Sudan	HOLOCENE												The 8500- to 7000-year-old shell-bearing sediments in shallow claypans near Wadi Mansurab in north-central Sudan appear to reflect a widespread and much wetter period in northeast Africa. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of the Wadi Mansurab gastropods reveals that the shell carbonate is highly depleted in C-13 and O-18. Th, highly depleted oxygen isotopic composition is indicative of rainfall derived from a distant oceanic source. The highly negative nature of the oxygen isotopes indicates that the region had significantly less evaporation than today while the extreme variability in isotopic composition (up to 6-7 parts per thousand PDB) is consistent with a seasonal rainfall regime, characterized by a high degree of inter-annual variability. The dominance of semi-aquatic and swamp-dwelling gastropods over truly aquatic species implies that the region was probably a seasonally flooded grassplain similar to the toich-lands of south-central Sudan today. Our data support the inference that towards 8500-7000 BP there was a stronger southwest monsoon and an associated northward shift in the summer rainfall zone, which caused the Wadi Mansurab region in north-central Sudan to be seasonally flooded during a wetter and possibly cooler period with lower rates of evapotranspiration. From 8500 to 7000 BP, lake levels were high elsewhere in northern Africa, suggesting a regionally wetter climate at that time.

Multiple climate shifts in the Southern Hemisphere over the past three centuries based on central Antarctic snow pits and core studies	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Based on the results of geochemical and glaciological investigations in snow pits and shallow cores, regional stack series of air temperature in central Antarctica (in the southern part of Vostok Subglacial Lake) were obtained, covering the last 350 years. It is shown that this parameter varied quasi-periodically with a wavelength of 30-50 years. The correlation of the newly obtained record with the circulation indices of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) shows that the central Antarctic climate is mainly governed by the type of circulation in the SH: under conditions of zonal circulation, negative anomalies of temperature and precipitation rate are observed, whereas the sign of the anomalies is positive during meridional circulation. In the 1970s the sign of the relationship between many climatic parameters changed, which is likely related to the rearrangement of the climatic system of the SH. The data suggest that during the past 350 years such events have taken place at least five times. The stable water isotope content of the central Antarctic snow is governed by the summer temperature rather than the mean annual temperature, which is interpreted as the influence of 'post-depositional' effects.

The combined response of urban lakes to climatic changes and to urbanization of the catchment may be further altered by water quality management measures. We studied Lake Tegel in Berlin, Germany as a representative urban lake profoundly influenced by intense water management measures and a resulting complex hydrodynamic situation: Lake Tegel is fed by nutrient-rich river discharges and effluents from a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP). We estimated changes in water temperatures, the Wedderburn number, and the buoyancy frequency, as well as concentrations of dissolved oxygen and phosphate under climate change using a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model coupled to a water quality model. Further, we investigated how four management scenarios with varying discharges of the PEP could affect the lake system. In all simulations, water temperatures increased and summer stratification extended. The modeling results demonstrated that the water management system buffers the high nutrient supply from the river inflow and can effectively mitigate negative effects of climate change on Lake Tegel, thus highlighting its importance for the lake ecosystem.					; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010	Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; Hinkelmann, Reinhard/0000-0002-1088-2321													2073-4441					FEB	2018	10	2							186	10.3390/w10020186	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10020186													WOS:000426775500096

One proteocephalid species, Proteocephalus exiguus, was found in the whitefish (Coregonus widegreni Malmgren, 1863, C. lavaretus L. of the sea and C. acronius Rapp 1854 of the lake) and in the vendace (C. albula L.) in both areas. The highest recorded prevalence was found in the sea vendace (82%), while it was also quite high in the lake vendace (63%). P. exiguus was also very common in the whitefish of the lake (69%) and in the river-spawning whitefish in the sea (62%). The heaviest proteocephalid burden was found in the river-spawning whitefish in the sea (37 worms per fish). The length of fish did not greatly influence proteocephalid infection, except in the lake vendace, where a sharp rise and later decrease was found in the prevalence. No clear seasonal variation in proteocephalid infection was found anywhere, but variation did exist in the maturation cycle of proteocephalids in the sea vendace and lake whitefish. Proteocephalids in the lake vendace also produced eggs during the winter. The effect of the low temperatures and the feeding activity of the fish on proteocephalid infections is reflected in an apparently prolonged life history of parasites at these latitudes.																			0015-5683	1803-6465					1988	35	4					317	328																WOS:A1988Q999500004

This proposal has raised concerns over the possible changes to the habitat of aquatic organisms. Vallisneria natans is a main food source for the Siberian Crane, an indicator species for migratory birds in Poyang Lake. In this study, the influence of the PLHP on the habitat suitability of Vallisneria natans is predicted based on a hydrodynamic model and the growth characteristics of Vallisneria natans. The results show that the effect of the PLHP varies greatly in different typical years. The mean monthly habitat area of Vallisneria natans can increase by up to 191% in a low-water-level year, 145% in a medium-water-level year, yet only 18% in a high-water-level year. The habitat area can reach more than 1000 km(2) during most of September and October, nearly 1/3 of the total area of the lake region. It indicates that Vallisneria natans will gain large areas of land suitable for its growth, and provide abundant food sources for Siberian Crane during winter. These findings can be helpful to evaluate the ecological benefits of the regulatory schemes of the PLHP.					zhang, taotao/AAK-6896-2021; YUAN, Kang/JZT-9952-2024; xiao, yang/JCD-7195-2023; Liang, Dongfang/D-2854-2011; Wang, Zixuan/HZJ-2348-2023	Liang, Dongfang/0000-0001-5639-7375; 													2045-2322					MAY 4	2022	12	1							7278	10.1038/s41598-022-11314-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11314-5								35508626					WOS:000790941900085

The presence of this erotic species was first reported in the Detroit River, where it now dominates; this species has been common in western Lake Erie since the summer of 1995. The species has replaced the native amphipod Gammarus fasciatus on rocky habitats in the St. Clair, Detroit, and Niagara rivers, and is the dominant amphipod on rocky shores in western Lake Erie. In one year, E. ischnus became the dominant amphipod at the Lake Ontario end of the Welland Caned, although the fecundity of E. ischnus is less than G. fasciatus. E. ischnus has not yet been reported from the north shore of Lake Ontario or the outlet into the St. Lawrence River but occurs 100 km further downstream at Prescott.																			0380-1330						1998	24	2					442	452		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70834-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70834-2													WOS:000074588400026

This research was intended to determine the TMDL of Beton Reservoir, a structure built to regulate the water discharge of Beton karst spring in Gunungkidul, Indonesia, especially during the rainy season. The TMDL calculation referred to the Regulation of the Minister of State for Environment No. 28 of 2009 on TMDLs of Lakes and/or Reservoirs that required a calculation of morphological and hydrological characteristics, and water quality to meet Class II standard issued in the Regulation of the Governor of the Special Region of Yogyakarta No. 20 of 2008. The results showed that Beton Reservoir had a total volume of 22 586.83 m(3), a surface area of 18 673.12 m(2), and a depth of averagely 1.21 m and released water at a rate of 0.48 m(3) s(-1). From the perspective of quality, the TSS and DO of its water had exceeded the standards, whereas the other parameters: temperature, TDS, pH, BOD, COD, total PO4, and NO3 were within their allowable presence in the water. Based on TMDLs for TSS, DO, BOD, COD, total PO4, and NO3, the Beton Reservoir can no longer accommodate TSS and NO3 while continuing to meet the standards for these pollutants. High levels of TSS and NO3 are attributable to the agricultural activities taking place on the catchment and the flow concentration typical of karst regions.																			2267-1242						2020	200								01006	10.1051/e3sconf/202020001006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202020001006													WOS:000659495600006
J	Ran, M; Chen, L				Ran, Min; Chen, Liang			The 4.2 ka BP climatic event and its cultural responses	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The 4.2 ka event was one of Holocene abrupt-change events and characterized by dry and cool climatic conditions in many parts of the world. The event was reported to have played important roles in the collapses of those major ancient civilizations. This paper first attempts to portray a global picture of this "4.2 ka Event" and then reviews those reliably-dated sequences containing "4.2 ka Event" retrieved from the domains of four major civilizations. This review further confirms the proposition advocated by the International Stratigraphy Committee that 4.2 ka was the chronological divider between the warmer-wetter middle Holocene and the cooler-drier late Holocene. This review also lends a further support to early proposals that the declines or disruptions of Ancient Egyptian Culture, Mesopotamian Culture, and Ancient Indian Culture at similar to 4.2 ka BP were directly or indirectly associated with the "4.2 ka Event". In Chinese cultural domain, the derailment of nearly all of the well-developed Neolithic cultures at similar to 4.2 ka BP was also chronologically correlated with the proxy data-recorded abrupt climatic change at similar to 4.2 ka BP. But, it should be admitted that either drying or cooling or drying and cooling at similar to 4.2 ka BP might not be sufficient to collapse these well-developed cultures in presently warm and wet southern China. Surely, further studies are needed for constraining the climatic and environmental variables at similar to 4.2 ka BP not only in southern China but also in the adjacent Central Plains of China.

Human disturbance amplifies Amazonian El Nino-Southern Oscillation signal	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The long-term interaction between human activity and climate is subject to increasing scrutiny. Humans homogenize landscapes through deforestation, agriculture, and burning and thereby might reduce the capacity of landscapes to provide archives of climate change. Alternatively, land-use change might overwhelm natural buffering and amplify latent climate signals, rendering them detectable. Here we examine a sub-annually resolved sedimentary record from Lake Sauce in the western Amazonian lowlands that spans 6900 years. Finely-laminated sediments were deposited from ca. 5000 years ago until the present, and human activity in the watershed was revealed through the presence of charcoal and maize agriculture. The laminations, analyzed for color content and bandwidth, showed distinctive changes that were coupled to more frequent occurrence of fossil maize pollen. As agricultural activity intensified ca. 2200 cal. BP, the 2- to 8-year periodicity characteristic of El Nino-Southern Oscillation became evident in the record. These agricultural activities appeared to have amplified an existing, but subtle climatic signal that was previously absorbed by natural vegetation. When agricultural activity slowed, or land use around Lake Sauce changed at ca. 800 cal. BP, the signal of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity became erratic.

J	Rydin, E				Rydin, Emil			Inactivated phosphorus by added aluminum in Baltic Sea sediment	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Decreased phosphorus (P) retention in aquatic sediments during hypoxic periods results in increased P recycling to the water column. To revert to less productive conditions in the enclosed bays of the Baltic Sea archipelago, increased sediment P burial capacity is needed. Aluminum (Al) addition is considered to be a cost-effective lake restoration method, as it improves sediment P burial capacity. However, little is known about its ability to permanently bind P in brackish systems. In summer 2000, Al sulfate granules were added to a hypoxic bottom area in the Osthammar bay, Sweden. Sediment core samples from the area were collected 10 years later. A peak in Al and P was detected at 20 cm sediment depth, reflecting the added Al and P trapped to it. Only part of the added Al was recovered, but the recovered Al (8 g Al/m(2)) trapped P at a ratio of 5:1 (molar). Chemical fractionation showed that P extracted as "Al-P" constituted 55% of the trapped P, indicating that Al added also trapped P extracted as other P forms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Vegetative substrates used by larval northern pike in Rainy and Kabetogama Lakes, Minnesota	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Our objective was to identify characteristics of aquatic vegetative communities used as larval northern pike nursery habitat in Rainy and Kabetogama lakes, glacial shield reservoirs in northern Minnesota. Quatrefoil light traps fished at night were used to sample larval northern pike in 11 potential nursery areas. Larval northern pike were most commonly sampled among floating-leaf burreed Sparganium fluctuans, common burreed Sparganium eurycarpum, sedges Carex spp., hybrid cattail Typhaxglauca and wild rice Zizania palustris. A negative binomial model of light-trap catches using the presence/absence data for 2012 from all 11 bays included water elevation and the presence of cattail as significant variables. Ultimately, the species of vegetation may not be as important as the physical quality or form of the vegetation in supplying feeding and hiding cover. The aquatic plant species and structural forms encountered by larval northern pike suggest they use nearly any vegetated cover available in early spring. Water-level regulations that change availability of aquatic vegetation are likely to influence recruitment of northern pike to larger sizes.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2015	24	2					225	233		10.1111/eff.12137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12137													WOS:000351349400006

This is especially pressing for Lake Baikal, a World Natural Heritage site. The Russian part of the Selenga watershed is a suitable site for climate change research. The study of changes in precipitation, runoff, and chemical runoff is important for sustainable water resources management. This study presents a trend analysis of precipitation and runoff at hydrological stations and weather stations in the Russian part of the Selenga River basin. A comparative analysis of the concentrations of major ions in the surface water of the Selenga River depending on water levels was also carried out. Analysis of the data series on precipitation revealed a slight negative trend at the Novoselenginsk, Ulan-Ude, and Kabansk stations, and a weak positive trend-at the Kyakhta station. Runoff analysis revealed negative trends at the two used stations (Novoselenginsk and Mostovoi). The hydrochemical regime of the Selenga River is characterized by an increase in major ions and salinity during winter low-water periods, and a decrease during high-water periods. Mineralization and major ion content are lower in the high-water period (2019-2021) than in the low-water period (2015-2017).

Prior to 2000, the Copahue crater lake, acid hot springs, and rivers carried acid brines with compositions that reflected close to congruent rock dissolution. The ratio between rock-forming elements and chloride in the central zone of the volcano-hydrothermal system has diminished over the past few years, reflecting increased water/rock ratios as a result of progressive rock dissolution. Magmatic activity in 2000 provided fresh rocks for the acid fluids, resulting in higher ratios between rock-forming elements and chloride in the fluids and enhanced Mg fluxes. The higher Mg fluxes started several weeks prior to the eruption. Model data on the crater lake and river element flux determinations indicate that Copahue volcano was hollowed out at a rate of about 20 000-25 000 m(3)/yr, but that void space was filled with about equal amounts of silica and liquid elemental sulfur. The extensive rock dissolution has weakened the internal volcanic structure, making flank collapse a volcanic hazard at Copahue.

J	Zolitschka, B; Francus, P; Ojala, AEK; Schimmelmann, A				Zolitschka, Bernd; Francus, Pierre; Ojala, Antti E. K.; Schimmelmann, Arndt			Varves in lake sediments - a review	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Downcore counting of laminations in varved sediments offers a direct and incremental dating technique for high-resolution climatic and environmental archives with at least annual and sometimes even seasonal resolution. The pioneering definition of varves by De Geer (1912) had been restricted to rhythmically deposited proglacial clays. One century later the meaning of 'varve' has been expanded to include all annually deposited laminae in terrestrial and marine settings. Under favourable basin configurations and environmental conditions, limnic varves are formed due to seasonality of depositional processes from the lake's water column and/or transport from the catchment area. Subsequent to deposition of topmost laminae, the physical preservation of the accumulating varved sequence requires the sustained absence of sediment mixing, for example via wave action or macrobenthic bioturbation. Individual (sub)laminae in varved lake sediments typically express contrasting colours, always differ in terms of their organic, chemical and/or mineralogical compositions, and often also differ with regard to grain-size. Various predominating climatic and depositional conditions may result in clastic, biogenic or endogenic (in cl. evaporitic) varved sediments and their mixtures. To reliably establish a varve chronology, the annual character of laminations needs to be determined and verified in a multidisciplinary fashion. Sources and influences of possible errors in varve chronologies are best determined and constrained by repeated varve counts, and by including radioisotopes and correlation with historically documented events. A well-established varve chronology greatly enhances the scientific value of laminated limnic archives by securely anchoring the wealth of multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental information in the form of time-series for multidisciplinary investigations. Applications of varved records are discussed with special reference to advances since the 1980s. These span fields like calibrating radiometric dating methods, reconstructing past changes of the Earth's magnetic field or detecting fluctuations in solar forcing. Once a verve chronology is established it can be applied to precisely date events like volcanic ash layers, earthquakes or human impact, as well as short-and long-term climate (temperature, precipitation, wind, hydroclimatic conditions or flooding) and environmental changes (eutrophication, pollution). Due to their exceptional high temporal resolution and in combination with their robust and accurate "internal" time scale in calendar years, annually laminated sediments can be regarded as one of the most precious environmental archives on the continents.

As such they have societal relevance with regard to risk assessments related to natural hazards arising from e.g. flooding or volcanic eruptions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bradley, BA; O'Sullivan, MT				Bradley, Bethany A.; O'Sullivan, Mary Tess			Assessing the short-term impacts of changing grazing regime at the landscape scale with remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Livestock grazing is an important form of land use, affecting ecosystems worldwide. In ecoregions that evolved with low densities of large ungulates, such as those in the western United States, there is ongoing debate as to the appropriate concentrations of livestock that can be sustained. Limited landscape-scale monitoring makes it difficult to pinpoint the landscape-scale impacts of livestock on ecosystems. In this study, we use remote sensing to identify landscape-scale changes in Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy for community greenness, following changes in land use in south-central Idaho, United States. Grazing allotments in the study area have been managed by Lava Lake Land & Livestock (Lava Lake) since 2001, and recent landscape-scale changes include reduced grazing intensity, longer rest periods and reduced grazing in riparian zones. Additionally, sheep bands owned by Lava Lake were collared with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to track their daily locations during the 2004-2005 summer grazing seasons. We found that increased NDVI was more likely to occur adjacent to riparian channels, which have been a focus for ecological recovery by land managers at Lava Lake. Decreased NDVI was most likely within 500 m of sheep grazing. However, the extent of impact differed depending on land use and elevation. Decreased NDVI on allotments with a large reduction in total number of sheep was most likely within only 60-150 m. Grazing on lands at elevations above 2300 m had no relationship to decreased NDVI. Our results suggest that grazing impacts are heterogeneous across the landscape and depend strongly on stocking rates and elevation (which is correlated to precipitation). Spatial analysis of NDVI can identify landscape-scale changes resulting from livestock grazing that may not be apparent from local monitoring. Patterns of change identified with remote sensing can guide ecosystem monitoring across extensive public and private lands.

J	BROBERG, O				BROBERG, O			NUTRIENT RESPONSES TO THE LIMING OF LAKE GARDSJON	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The acidified lakes Lake Gardsjon and Lake Stora Hastevatten the reference lake have been monitored since 1979 and 1980, respectively. The lakes are situated in SW Sweden; in an area severely affected by acid deposition. Lake Gardsjon was limed in spring 1982. This paper analyses changes in nutrient concentrations upon liming of Lake Gardsjon. The liming of Lake Gardsjon was followed by a slight increase in ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations. A drastic decrease occurred in particulate nitrogen and particulate carbon, whereas dissolved organic carbon increased. Total phosphorus and particulate phosphorus concentrations were similar to pre-limed conditions. The long-term decrease in phosphorus concentration, exhibited by the reference lake, was not identified in Lake Gardsjon after liming, but total phosphorus concentration was still less than half compared to Lake Gardsjon in the early 1970''s. Additional measures such as phosphorus fertilization, should in certain cases be considered in addition to liming if the goal is to restore lakes to their pre-acidic conditions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 10	1987	150	1					11	24		10.1007/BF00006606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006606													WOS:A1987J124800002

Environmental Consequences of Landscape Fires in Trans-Baikal Forests	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA												Landscape fires play the leading role in the modern anthropogenic dy-namics of forest ecosystems in south-eastern Siberia. Forest pyrologists consider them the most destructive manifestation of fires - an environmental factor that acts across wide areas to change the state of landscapes. Due to the insufficient knowledge of the nature of pyrogenic forest ecosystems, especially its dynamic aspects in the forest -forming process, obtaining data on the pyrogenic dynamics of forest ecosystems be-longing to various ranks is of broad scientific interest. A new aspect of this study is assessing ecosystem transformations under various pyrological regimes that determine the pyrogenic successions of plant communities, the hydrothermal regime of soils, a post-fire runoff, etc. The history of catastrophic landscape fires in the Baikal and Trans-Baikal regions began after the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. At that time, a long strip of coastal hemiboreal small-leaved deciduous forests formed along the southern shore of Lake Baikal, in the area of indigenous dark coniferous tai-ga, as a result of the "selective" impact of a lingering series of fires that followed in-tense forest harvesting. It happened regardless of the average productivity of the py-rogenic stands being 30-40% lower vs. the potential level. The landscape fires of the 1930-1950s that arose during industrial development, especially in the areas of in-tense forest harvesting, caused heavy damage to forest ecosystems throughout Trans-baikalia. Now, due to a regress in the Russian forest management, landscape fires have turned into an archaic alternative to the ecological progress as of the 1970s and 1980s. Therefore, the relevant goal of this article is to consider the transformation of forest ecosystems after landscape fires.The emergence and spread of landscape fires were studied during two fire -intensive seasons through the air monitoring of the Trans-Baikal territory. Geographic coordinates: 49-57 degrees N, 99-122 degrees E. Regular pyrological studies of the seasonal dy-namics of the forest fire danger implied the use of the method suggested by N.P. Kur-batsky (1970) [9]. The permanent trial plots were located on the Malkhansky and Khamar-Daban Mountain Ranges. The route studies covered the Selenga Highlands, as well as the basins of the Rivers Barguzin, Turka, Upper Angara, Muya, and Chara. Fig. 1 shows the schematic map of the sites. The pyrological regimes of vegetation complexes were established based on research data (see the table). The environmental consequences of landscape fires were studied in the forests of South-Eastern Baikal and Central Transbaikalia. The closest observations of the dynamics of burned (in-cluding through prescribed burning) and control stands were performed on permanent sample plots. There the researchers also ensured regular accounting of litterfall using special 1x1m collectors. The grain composition and physical and mechanical proper-ties of the soils were determined via the common methods [21]. The pyrogenic varia-tions of the forest-forming process after landscape fires were observed in different natural districts (Fig. 2).Pyrological regimes differ in the altitude-belt complexes (ABC) of vegetation and correspond to a wide range of atmospheric moistening. Forest-steppe vegetation pre-vails in the valleys of large rivers and low mountains in the conditions of extremely insufficient moistening. This vegetation is exposed to an extreme fire regime in the spring and in the early summer. The Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L. ) prevails in sub -taiga-forest-steppe forests. There, an intense regime takes place even in a standard weather situation. The fire maturation of forests in the light-coniferous taiga belt with predominant larches (Larix sibirica Ledeb., Larix gmelini Rupr.) is approximately two times longer vs. forest-steppe and hemiboreal forests. Accordingly, the pyrological regimes vary from intense to moderate. Dark coniferous forests comprising the Sibe-rian pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour.), fir (Abies sibirica Ledeb.) and spruce (Picea obo-vata Ledeb.) are confined to wet belts with a moderate pyrological regime. A safe re-gime prevails in the subalpine ABC. The general fire danger is determined by ground fires, after which most burned forests retain their vitality at the level of their fire re-sistance, as well as depending on the actual intensity of fire in this area. Fig. 3 illus-trates the typical dynamics of Scots pine stands established based on forest manage-ment data. In fact, diverse structural transformations of plant communities are ob-served after landscape fires - from a moderate fire damage to heavy thinning caused by an intense fire, and even complete death after head fires with probable local defor-estation. Fig. 4 shows the comparative dynamics of the population of trees in normal and pyrogenic larch forests. Larch trees have an advantageous position vs. pines, as they are better protected from thermal damage by their thick bark. Besides, the crowns of larch trees are capable of regenerating needles and shoots damaged by fire. The du-ration of recovery to the pre-fire basal area increases exponentially with age, since forest stands inevitably face a growth decline as they become old. The pyrogenic di-gression of larch forests in permafrost areas with a burned peat horizon was followed by a tree fall, which was observed during the air monitoring of fires. Later thickets of birch and willow trees formed there. The fire damage to trees (trunks and crown), the ground cover, as well as the hydrothermal regime of soils are most comprehensively studied in the Scots pine forests of Central Transbaikalia where the ground cover and lower forest layers were explored not only at natural fire sites but also through pre-scribed burning. The integral picture of forest disturbance with landscape fires is complex and diverse. On mountain slopes, the strongest fire was observed when it was moving upwards. The speed and direction of the wind, as well as the daily tem-perature and humidity rhythm played a significant role in the spread of the fire line. Therefore, extensive landscape fires left behind a chaotic structure of damaged and dead stands. Later, a complex mosaic of uneven-aged stands modified by repeated fires formed during post-fire reforestation. After high-intensity fires, the forest plant communities were locally replaced by steppe ones, while reforestation took entire decades. Successions after fires were different. Extensive fires in the upper taiga ABC used to lower the upper boundary of the forest belt. Meanwhile, situations being de-structive for the forest ecosystems of Transbaikalia regularly recurred, which was clearly seen based on the 200-year dynamics of the tree-ring width of the Scots pine in the River Turka valley. The tree diagram in Fig. 5 unambiguously shows a sharp decline in the width of tree rings at the turn of the 19th-20th centuries when the Trans-Siberian Railway was built. One may also identify drought periods in the 1930-1970s. The pyrogenic anomaly of 2015 that covered over 10% of the Baikal region turned out to be extremely dangerous.

J	Bowers, R; de Szalay, FA				Bowers, R; de Szalay, FA			Effects of water level fluctuations on zebra mussel distribution in a Lake Erie coastal wetland	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												In May-August 2002, we examined how seasonal water level changes and frequent wind-driven seiches limited the amount of habitat for zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in a Lake Erie coastal wetland. We counted numbers of veligers that colonized artificial substrates at different depths (1-17 cm, 18-34 cm and >34 cm below the water surface). Water levels decreased during the summer, and by August colonization plates set at 1- 17 cm were exposed 85% of the time, plates set at 18-34 cm were exposed 15% of the time, but plates set at >34 cm were rarely exposed. The highest densities (numbers/m(2)) of colonization occurred in June (7176. 1) and August (3 119.5), and this bimodal pattern has been observed in other Great Lake habitats. Densities were highest at >34 cm depths (5552.7), intermediate at 18-34 cm (2802.1) and lowest at 1-17 cm (410.8). Veliger numbers on some plates in deep water levels were as high as 10,000/m(2), which are similar to densities in the Great Lakes. We also measured survivorship of adult mussels in wire mesh cages from 28 July to 25 August. Most (similar to 90%) adult zebra mussels survived in both 18-34 cm and >34 cm, water levels, but only similar to 2% survived in 1- 17 cm water levels. We determined the percent of Crane Creek Marsh in each of the three water depth zones and estimated that water level changes prevent zebra mussels from inhabiting 62% of this coastal wetland. The low survival of zebra mussels may be a reason why abundant unionids have recently been found in this and some other Great Lake coastal wetlands.

Assessment of cropland inundation due to the operation of the Reelfoot Lake spillway in West Tennessee	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Running Reelfoot Bayou (RRB) is the outlet canal of Reelfoot Lake, the largest natural lake in Tennessee. RRB is not able to contain discharge from Reelfoot Lake greater than the bankfull discharge of 28 m(3)/s (1000 ft(3)/s), which typically occurs at the beginning of the growing season (April-June). Historically, the planting of crops has been delayed until flooding subsides and cropland has drained. The objective of this study is a preliminary quantification of cropland inundation to determine its spatial distribution in the RRB floodplain. Inundated croplands in the RRB floodplain were delineated over a range of spillway discharges from 2 to 57 m(3)/s (70-2000 ft(3)/s), using one-dimensional-two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling and multispectral satellite images (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2). The composite maps made by combining the simulated and image-derived flood maps were overlaid on the United States Department of Agriculture CropScape layer to determine the inundation of individual summer crops during the growing season. About 25% of the inundated croplands are flooded at discharges of RRB less than 28 m(3)/s, implying wetland hydrology. The results of this analysis can be used to inform operational management of the Reelfoot Lake spillway.

J	Liu, X; Lu, XH; Chen, YW				Liu, Xia; Lu, Xiaohua; Chen, Yuwei			The effects of temperature and nutrient ratios on Microcystis blooms in Lake Taihu, China: An 11-year investigation	HARMFUL ALGAE												The temporal distribution of bloom-forming cyanobacteria- Microcystis and its correlation with related physical and chemical variables including the total nitrogen-to-total phosphorus ratio (TN:TP), the ammonium-to-nitrate ratio (NH4-N:NOx-N), water temperature, and pH in the north part of Lake Taihu (Meiliang Bay) were investigated, using a continuous, 11-year record of environmental data (1992-2002) and phytoplankton species. A multivariate statistical analysis, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), revealed a negative correlation between the Microcystis and TN:TP, and a positive correlation between the Microcystis and NH4-N:NOx-N, water temperature and pH. Warm water temperature was the principal force driving Microcystis blooms, which were preceded declining concentrations of nitrogen compounds. Microcystis tended to dominate (Microcystis contributed above 50% to total algal mass) in the north part of Lake Taihu during summer when the TN:TP mass ratio was less than 30. NH4-N:NOx-N was below 1, and a critical water temperature ranged from 25 degrees C to 30 degrees C. respectively. Meanwhile, suspended solids (SS) concentrations exceeded 10 mg l(-1) and pH exceeded 8.0 during blooms. Overall, this study advances our understanding of nutrient enrichment and high ambient temperature influences on Microcystis biomass. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sediment cores from the area were collected to study its development after the last deglaciation, in particular the sea-level history. Late glacial and Early Holocene lake and bog deposits occur below marine deposits. Sparse late glacial fossil assemblages indicate tree-less environments with dwarf-shrub heaths. Early Holocene deposits contain remains of Betula sec. Albae sp. and Pinus sylvestris, which indicate open forests. The wetland flora comprised the calciphilous reed plant Cladium mariscus and the water plant Najas marina. Marine gyttja from basins is characterised by sparse benthic faunas, probably due to high sedimentation rates. In some areas, shell-rich deposits were found, with large shells of Ostrea edulis, indicative of high summer temperatures, high salinity and strong tidal currents. A marine shell dated to 6.7 cal. ka provides a minimum age for the marine transgression of Lammefjorden.

J	KALAS, S				KALAS, S			THE ECOLOGY OF RUFFE, GYMNOCEPHALUS-CERNUUS (PISCES, PERCIDAE) INTRODUCED TO MILDEVATN, WESTERN NORWAY	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Diet, habitat use, diel and seasonal activity and a number of population parameters were studied on ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus, introduced to Mildevatn, western Norway. This lake is sited outside the natural range of the ruffe and has a lower fish diversity and a different fish species composition than within its native range. From June through September the ruffe was planktivorous and mainly caught at 4 to 6 m depth in the benthic zone. At other times of year ruffe was feeding on zoobenthos and caught deeper in the benthic zone. Ruffe was mainly day active. Zooplankton feeding during summer is the dearest difference compared to ruffe populations living within its natural range. Presence of large zooplankton organisms available for ruffe is suggested as the main reason for the difference found in food choice. The availability of large zooplankton is probably due to community structure caused by a predator and lack of interspecific competition for zooplankton in the deeper parts of the lake. Piscivorous brown trout, Salmo trutta, restrict the habitat of threespined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, to the zone of littoral vegetation, allowing high densities of larger zooplankton species like Bythotrephes longimanus to be present in the lake. Brown trout is present only in the upper light and well oxygenated parts of the lake, leaving a refuge for the ruffe, where they can feed on the rich zooplankton community.																			0378-1909					MAR	1995	42	3					219	232		10.1007/BF00004915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004915													WOS:A1995QL48100001

Natural fluxes of UV-B radiation (280-320 nm) were manipulated with cutoff filters (Mylar(R)). There was substantial mortality in some of the zooplankton exposed to UV-B in the oligotrophic lake, but not in the eutrophic lake. Reproduction of Diaptomus was suppressed by UV-B down to 6 m in the oligotrophic lake. These data suggest that natural levels of UV-B radiation in the oligotrophic lake may prevent some species of zooplankton from continuously exploiting the warm surface waters during summer stratification. In the more eutrophic lake, UV-B is a less important constraint in the vertical distribution of zooplankton. These differences in the responses of zooplankton to natural UV-B radiation in lakes may alter their ecological interactions with food resources, predators and other environmental variables in the water column.					; Schulze, Peter/ABE-5320-2021	Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR	1994	16	3					205	218		10.1093/plankt/16.3.205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/16.3.205													WOS:A1994NH06000001
J	Mieczan, T				Mieczan, Tomasz			Microcosm on a bottle: experimental tests on the colonization of plastic and g ass substrates in a retention reservoir	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The last few decades have seen a dramatic increase in water pollution due to various types of waste generated by human activity. These include plastic and glass accumulating in the shore area of lakes and oceans. These substrates may be colonized by various groups of aquatic organisms. Little is known of the trophic interrelationships between micro- and macroorganisms colonizing Plastic (PB) and Glass Bottles (GB). Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to determine the taxonomic composition and abundance of micro- and macroorganisms colonizing artificial, anthropogenic substrates, the trophic relationships between the organisms colonizing these substrates, and the influence of the physicochemical properties of the water on the formation of such assemblages. Studies of micro- and macroorganisms were carried out on the surface of PB and GB in a eutrophic retention basin. Both the species richness and abundance of microorganisms and metazoa were found to be determined by the type of substrate colonized as well as by the physicochemical properties of the water (primarily the content of total organic carbon and biogenic compounds). Furthermore, the trophic structure of microbial assemblages demonstrated seasonal variability. In spring, the substrates were colonized by typical bacterivorous ciliates, whereas in the following seasons there was a larger share of omnivorous species (ciliates and rotifers). This may indicate that the accumulation of various types of anthropogenic waste, in the present case GB and PB, may contribute to changes in the matter and energy cycle, including the carbon cycle, in various microhabitats of aquatic ecosystems.

Microcystis is one of the most common genera of freshwater cyanobacteria and is often the dominating phytoplankton of eutrophic lakes all over the world. In eutrophic lakes, large amounts of Microcystis may overwinter in the sediment and re-inoculate the water column in spring. In most cases, the overwintering pelagic population-if it exists-is small, and its role in re-inoculation has not been clear yet. In December 2005, we found large amounts of Microcystis on the surface, frozen in the ice cover in a eutrophic pond (Pond Harmashegy, Hungary). We identified the Microcystis species and investigated the viability and the toxicity of the frozen cells. The dominant species in the bloom samples was Microcystis viridis. Viability tests showed that the colonies isolated from the ice cover were composed of living cells. The isolated strain was found toxic, we analyzed the microcystin composition in the frozen planktonic Microcystis mass; in the investigated samples microcystin-RR was the main cyanotoxin.

Disentangling the impacts of climate and human colonization on the flora and fauna of the Australian arid zone over the past 100 ka using stable isotopes in avian eggshell	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Throughout the Quaternary, the flora and fauna of Australia evolved and adapted to the high-amplitude, low- and high-frequency climate changes that characterized the ice-age cycles. However, during the last glacial cycle, between 120 and 15 ka, unprecedented irreversible changes in flora and fauna occurred, and in that same interval modern humans established their first firm presence in the landscape. Disentangling the impacts of the first-order trend toward a colder, drier planet through the Late Quaternary from the impacts of human colonization has been challenging, from both the chronological and paleoenvironmental perspectives. We utilize the stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen preserved in near continuous time series of Dromaius (emu) eggshell from five regions across Australia to provide independent reconstructions of ecosystem status and climate over the past 100 ka. Carbon isotopes are determined by the diet consumed by the female bird, whereas oxygen isotopes record the status of local moisture balance in the months prior to breeding. Together, delta C-13 and delta O-18 provide ecosystem status and climate from the same dated sample, reducing correlation uncertainties between proxies. Combined with recent improvements in the chronologies of Late Quaternary shorelines fringing inland lake basins and deflation during arid times, these data collectively reaffirm that Australia generally became increasingly, albeit irregularly, drier from the last interglaciation through to the last glacial maximum. Dromaius eggshell delta O-18 documents peak aridity between 30 and 15 ka, but shows no evidence of exceptional climate change between 60 and 40 ka. In contrast, Dromaius delta C-13(diet) documents an irreversible loss of the majority of palatable summer-rainfall-related C4 grasses across the Australian arid zone between 50 and 45 ka, about the same time that the giant megafaunal bird, Genyornis, became extinct, and coincident with human dispersal across the continent. Our data indicate that changes unique to Australia occurred between 50 and 45 ka that led to a new climate-vegetation relationship and an overall reduction in effective moisture across much of the continent. The large summer-rainfall-dominated lakes of interior Australia failed to re-fill subsequently, despite a wide range of global climate states. A full explanation for the mechanisms behind these changes remains elusive, but they are almost certainly related to human agency. Plausible explanations include a change in fire regime resulting from human-lit fires, a change in fire regime following extinction of megafaunal browsers, and/or a threshold response to increasing aridity. Of these, the climate change explanation is least likely, given the lack of evidence for unprecedented aridity between 60 and 40 ka, and the successful adaptation of Australian ecosystems to 2.5 Ma of similar changes.

D15102	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Carbon dioxide is a stable constituent of the atmosphere that has no major terrestrial sinks other than atmospheric transport in the absence of photosynthetic activity by plants. In urban atmospheres, CO2 mixing ratios are often elevated above ambient by large local sources from combustion. We measured CO2 mixing ratios and the isotopic composition of CO2 at four locations in the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, during a persistent cold pool event in the winter of 2004. The results showed a strong influence of atmospheric stability and the height of the capping inversion on CO2 mixing ratios and suggested that during persistent cold pool events the air mass beneath the capping inversion can be relatively well mixed. Spatial and temporal patterns in the isotopic composition of CO2 and the relationship between particulate concentrations and CO2 mixing ratio support this interpretation. These results suggest that CO2 mixing ratio, which is abundant and relatively easily measured in urban atmospheres, can provide information about complex wintertime atmospheric transport and mixing as well as carbon cycling in urban mountain basins.

J	Lifshits, AL				Lifshits, Alexandr L.			LIFE OF HERODION ILOEZERSKY (ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL HAGIOGRAPHIC TEXTS AND LOCAL HISTORY)	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The Life of St. Herodion Iloezersky (LH) is an unstudied monument of regional hagiography, which reflects the characteristics of this type of hagiographical texts. Life events of the Reverend seem quite trivial, if not to know their legal, economic and home background. The LH provides diverse material for the study of Russian hagiography in general and of the 17th century in particular, and of the local history of the White Lake region. Hagiographical text, which seems to have little information in terms of "big" history, is extremely important to local history and the history of daily life. The documentary legal materials complete the LH. In the spring of 1653, Archimandrite of the Cyril-Belozersky Monastery Mitrofan held an investigation, as a result of which a document was drawn up, recording the evidence of local residents about the events that were somehow connected with the Rev. Herodion. Accurate and legally significant record of evidence was the main task of the church investigation. The discovery of documentary materials for the preparation of the canonization of Saint Herodion, a variety of versions of hagiographical text, numerous documentary evidence about life of Ozatskaya rural municipality, where the saint was active, allows us to put the question of originality of the hagiographic text and of the definition of the rules, by which series of events reflected in the text of a legal document were converted to hagiographical text. Comparative analysis of the document and of the hagiographic text allows seeing some patterns of transformation of the legal document into hagiographical text. It shows that the story of an event being "translated" from the language of everyday life into the language of "Kingdom of Heaven" looses details, names of minor characters, dates, circumstances of the incident. Important is the fact that in the text of the life the central character of each story stands as far as possible, "solo" as a person interacting with a higher power, either directly or by means of only one saint, but never with the participation of other people who also fall into the category of circumstances without direct relation to the event. In the initial period of its existence hagiographical text was or could be addressed to the people who themselves were participants or eyewitnesses of the events described. In the stories about miracles in the LH between man and God there is the only mediator Rev. Herodion. Everything else, however important it may seem to modern readers and listeners, did not matter in the distant past (in their ordinary daily life). That is, the apparent causal relationship between events in one row, from the perspective of the compiler of the hagiographic monument and certainly in terms of audience LH was imaginary. Thus, the hagiographic text is subordinated primarily to one purpose: it must demonstrate the true (spiritual) nature of the event, and that makes all particular details totally unnecessary, including causal relationships that can only obscure the timeless meaning.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				APR	2012		357					11	+																WOS:000421497200002
J	Torke, B				Torke, B			The distribution of calanoid copepods in the plankton of Wisconsin Lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Zooplankton communities from 499 lakes were examined for calanoid copepod species. Limnocalanus macrurus and Senecella calaloides are confined to Lakes Michigan, Superior and one inland lake each. Eurytemora affinis has recently become established in the coastal waters of Lakes Michigan and Superior. Epischura lacustris is present in the summer plankton of a wide variety of lake types. Aglaodiaptomus leptopus is sensitive to fish predation and confined to small lakes without fish. Leptodiaptomus ashlandi is restricted to Lakes Michigan and Superior, but L. sicilis is also found in some inland lakes. Leptodiaptomus minutus is a boreal species found mostly in lakes of the far north. Skistodiaptomus oregonensis is the most commonly occurring calanoid and seems well adapted to lakes of the meso-to low eutrophic types. Skistodiaptomus pallidus is also generally distributed throughout the state, but less common than oregonensis and adapted to more eutrophic lakes. Leptodiaptomus siciloides and A. clavipes are western species, adapted to eutrophic lakes, which are expanding their ranges eastward, aided by cultural eutrophication.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					2001	453	1-3					351	365		10.1023/A:1013185916287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013185916287													WOS:000172600200028

Fluctuations in plankton community structure of endorheic soda lakes of southeastern Transbaikalia (Russia)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The aim of present research is to study the patterns of phyto- and zooplankton fluctuations in endorheic soda lakes (Uldz Gol-Torey Basin, southeastern Transbaikalia, Russia) under arid conditions because studied area is becoming increasingly arid. Plankton samples were collected in summer during time intervals with different lake water levels using standard hydrobiological methods. We detected four patterns of change in plankton communities with changing environmental conditions (increasing total dissolved solid, pH and temperature, and decreasing depth). The first pattern is characterized by a predominance of green algae, charophytes, diatoms and euglenophytes; the species composition and dominant zooplankton assemblage are the same in different years. The second pattern is characterized by a loss of cryptophyte and chrysophyte algae, a dominance of green and blue-green algae, a decrease in zooplankton species diversity, and an increased abundance of zooplankton, the dominant species are consistent over time. The third pattern exhibits marked decreases in phytoplankton diversity and density, a dominance of green algae and diatoms, a further decrease in the species richness of zooplankton, and increased abundance and biomass of some species. The fourth pattern is a marked by a reduction in plankton species diversity to a monospecific community.

However, their effects on the phytoplankton community composition are still largely unexplored especially in freshwater systems such as lakes. In this paper, using field observations and mesocosm bioassay experiments, we investigated the impact of turbulence generated by wind waves on the phyto-plankton community composition (especially on harmful cyanobacteria) in Lake Taihu, a large, shallow eutrophic lake in China. The composition of the phytoplankton community varied with the intensity of wind waves in the different areas of the lake. During summer, when wind waves were strong in the central lake, diatoms and green algae seemed to dominate while harmful cyanobacteria dominated in the weakly influenced Meiliang Bay. Turbulence bioassays also showed that diatoms and green algae were favoured by turbulent mixing. The critical time for the shift of the phytoplankton community composition was approximately 10 days under turbulent conditions. However, short-term (6 days) turbulence is rather beneficial for the dominance of cyanobacteria. This study suggests that the duration of wind events and their associated hydrodynamics are key factors to understanding the temporal and spatial changes of phytoplankton communities.

J	Nnadozie, CE; Odume, ON				Nnadozie, Chika F.; Odume, Oghenekaro Nelson			Freshwater environments as reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Freshwater environments are susceptible to possible contamination by residual antibiotics that are released through different sources, such as agricultural runoffs, sewage discharges and leaching from nearby farms. Freshwater environment can thus become reservoirs where an antibiotic impact microorganisms, and is an important public health concern. Degradation and dilution processes are fundamental for predicting the actual risk of antibiotic resistance dissemination from freshwater reservoirs. This study reviews major approaches for detecting and quantifying antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) and genes (ARGs) in freshwater and their prevalence in these environments. Finally, the role of dilution, degradation, transmission and the persistence and fate of ARB/ARG in these environments are also reviewed. Culture-based single strain approaches and molecular techniques that include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and metagenomics are techniques for quantifying ARB and ARGs in freshwater environments. The level of ARBs is extremely high in most of the river systems (up to 98% of the total detected bacteria), followed by lakes (up to 77% of the total detected bacteria), compared to dam, pond, and spring (<1%). Of most concern is the occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which cause highly epidemic infections. Dilution and natural degradation do not completely eradicate ARBs and ARGs in the freshwater environment. Even if the ARBs in freshwater are effectively inactivated by sunlight, their ARG-containing DNA can still be intact and capable of transferring resistance to non-resistant strains. Antibiotic resistance persists and is preserved in freshwater bodies polluted with high concentrations of antibiotics. Direct transmission of indigenous freshwater ARBs to humans as well as their transitory insertion in the microbiota can occur. These findings are disturbing especially for people that rely on freshwater resources for drinking, crop irrigation, and food in form of fish. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little attention has been given to predicting and evaluating the geothermal potential in Dali's Eryuan area. This study introduces a novel hierarchical model integrating remote sensing, a Geographic Information System (GIS), and geophysics for the first-ever effective prediction of geothermal potential in Eryuan. The dataset includes lithology, seismic epicenter data, fault distribution, Bouguer gravity anomalies, SRTM-DEM images, and Landsat 8 remote sensing images. These datasets are converted into evidence maps and normalized to generate distinct evidence factor layers. Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a hierarchical model establishes weights for each evidence factor, resulting in a comprehensive prediction map. The results reveal the overall favorable geothermal potential in Eryuan, except the central area. Key hotspots include the Niujie-Sanying-Gromwell Lake and Liantie-Qiaohou, followed by the Youshou, Dengchuan, and Xixiang towns. Validation against known hot springs confirms the model's accuracy and reliability.

One concern with the technique is the potential loss of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds in the high vacuum environment. Cryo-cooling in the intro chamber enables us to retain semi-volatile compounds including PAHs and alkanes on surfaces for over an hour in the analytical chamber. Samples collected using an eight-stage Graseby-Anderson cascade impactor included aerosols from winter snowmobile emissions in Yellowstone National Park and urban aerosol from the Salt Lake Valley. Comparison of spectra obtained at ambient temperature with those obtained under cryogenic conditions show a clear loss of both aromatic and aliphatic organic species at ambient temperature.

A comparison of the frequencies of the three homologous genotypes St/St-St/BII-BII/BII from different parts of the lake shows that stations with the greatest depths have the highest St/BII-frequencies during the spring. At the same time thee stations exhibit excesses of the mentioned heterokaryotype compared to the Hardy-Weinberg distribution. The mentioned inversion is in all probability sustained by the superiority of the heterozygote St/BII in the part of the lake called Lake Tystrup. In samples from Lake Bavelse there was almost agreement between the observed and the expected numbers of the three genotypes in question (based on the Hardy-Weinberg distribution). Differences in the genotype frequencies and in the contrivances of the polymorphisms show that the two parts of Lake Tystrup-Bavelse have two separate populations, without recognizable gene-flow.																			1601-5223						1986	105	2					209	219		10.1111/j.1601-5223.1986.tb00664.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1601-5223.1986.tb00664.x													WOS:A1986F421100007

Ecosystem Services and Fishery Production Dynamics of Wetland Ecosystem: An Appraisal of Alappuzha District of Kerala, India	FISHERY TECHNOLOGY												Wetlands serve as home to innumerable flora and fauna and deliver critical ecological and societal functions which often tend to get ignored during the developmental process. An assessment of ecosystem service contribution of wetlands of Alappuzha was attempted under benefit transfer framework to raise awareness regarding its invaluable contributions. The district being home to a network of backwaters falling under coastal lagoons, coastal natural wetands dominated the share. Erosion regulation and sediment retention, food production and recreation were the major ecosystem functions contributing to total ecosystem value. An assessment of growth and variability of inland fisheries, the major provisioning good of the wetlands, revealed the significance of Prawn, Etroplus and Tilapia in fish landings. Analysis of change in the area of Vembanad Lake during 2002-2014 revealed growing anthropogenic pressure, with a reduction of 465 ha of area. Fisheries of the lake has been seriously affected by continuing reclamation, pollution, eutrophication and anthropogenic interventions which have to be regulated to stop the decline of wetlands of the district.

Although studies of them began in 1736, they are one of the least studied areas of the Arctic. The region has no population, is remote, and has difficult access. As a result, the mountainous tundra ecosystems are preserved practically in a pristine state. The mountains are composed of siltstones and intrusive rocks of neutral composition; vast areas along all the mountain chain are occupied by exposed limestone. Rivers flow in deep intermontane depressions while lakes are found mainly in faults. The climate is an extremely severe continental type. Microclimatic areas provide some relief and support a rich and diverse flora. There have been 391 species and subspecies of vascular plants recorded, but no reliable data on the number of species of mosses and lichens are available. Relict thickets of tall willows are found in protected valleys of piedmont brooks, whereas relict alder-tree thickets occur on warm slopes. The mountain fauna includes nine mammal and 56 bird species. Intermontane depressions serve as corridors for seasonal migrations of wild reindeer that usually spend summers in the southern piedmont areas. Northern piedmonts and wide intermontane depressions are places where herds of musk-ox, introduced in the 1970s, concentrate. The bird fauna of relict willow thickets is highly specific and the fish fauna is quite diverse (16 species), but some species in Taymyr Lake (Ozero Taymyr) have been overexploited. This paper provides the first detailed biogeographical description of the Byrranga Mountains in English.

Nest and perch trees were broader and taller, had more unobstructed branches, and were less obstructed by adjacent trees compared to reference trees. Perch trees also were more often deciduous than reference trees. Nest sites had more shoreline perch trees than reference sites. Logistic regression models with tree height as the independent variable distinguished nest and perch trees front randomly selected reference trees. Models with number of perch trees along a 1.25 ba (50 in width) shoreline section distinguished nest sites from reference sites. These models suggest that the presence of trees greater than or equal to15 in tall within 50 in of the shoreline is a good predictor of Madagascar Fish-Eagle habitat use.

Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas 16S rRNA genes were amplified in a nested PCR, and the identity of the products was confirmed by oligonucleotide hybridization. Nitrosospira DNA was readily identified in all samples, and nitrosomonad DNA of the Nitrosomonas europaea-Nitrosomonas eutropha lineage was also directly detected, but during the summer months only. Phylogenetic delineation with partial (345 bp) 16S rRNA gene sequences of clones obtained from sediments confirmed the fidelity of the amplified nitrosomonad DNA and identified two sequence clusters closely related to either N. europaea or N. eutropha that were equated with the littoral and profundal sediment sites, respectively. Determination of 701-bp sequences for 16S rDNA clones representing each cluster confirmed this delineation. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) system was developed that enabled identification of clones containing N. europaea and N. eutropha 16S rDNA sequences, including subclasses therein, It proved possible to analyze 16S rDNA amplified directly from sediment samples to determine the relative abundance of each species compared with that of the other. N. europaea and N, eutropha are very closely related, and direct evidence for their presence in lake systems is limited. The correlation of each species with a distinct spatial location in sediment is an unusual example of niche adaptation by two genotypically similar bacteria. Their occurrence and relative distribution can now be routinely monitored in relation to environmental variation by: the application of PCR-RFLP analysis.

Approximately 800 animals are estimated to have died over a 9-year period on a government farm near Lake Malawi. Deaths occurred exclusively from August to December when ripe dry pods that fell to the ground were ingested. The major clinical signs were hyperaesthesia, wild running,lateral recumbency with rapid leg movements, nystagmus and rapid blinking. Approximately 75 % of clinical cases made a full and rapid recovery. Sheep more often showed signs of poisoning than goats which was attributed to inherent susceptibility rather than selective feeding. The majority of animals affected were under 1 year of age. A series of experiments was conducted and all animals dosed with 6.4 g/kg or more of dry pods died with typical clinical signs. Although A. versicolor is well known to the local population there appeared to be no appreciation of its toxicity.

J	Scharenbroch, BC; Bockheim, JG				Scharenbroch, B. C.; Bockheim, J. G.			Gaps and soil C dynamics in old growth northern hardwood-hemlock forests	ECOSYSTEMS												Old growth forest soils are large C reservoirs, but the impacts of tree-fall gaps on soil C in these forests are not well understood. The effects of forest gaps on soil C dynamics in old growth northern hardwood-hemlock forests in the upper Great Lakes region, USA, were assessed from measurements of litter and soil C stocks, surface C efflux, and soil microbial indices over two consecutive growing seasons. Forest floor C was significantly less in gaps (19.0 Mg C ha(-1)) compared to gap-edges (39.5 Mg C ha(-1)) and the closed forest (38.0 Mg C ha(-1)). Labile soil C (coarse particulate organic matter, cPOM) was significantly less in gaps and edges (11.1 and 11.2 Mg C ha(-1)) compared to forest plots (15.3 Mg C ha(-1)). In situ surface C efflux was significantly greater in gaps (12.0 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1)) compared to edges and the closed forest (9.2 and 8.9 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1)). Microbial biomass N (MBN) was significantly greater in edges (0.14 Mg N ha(-1)) than in the contiguous forest (0.09 Mg N ha(-1)). The metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) was significantly greater in the forest (0.0031 mg CO2 h(-1) g(-1)/mg MBC g(-1)) relative to gaps or edges (0.0014 mg CO2 h(-1) g(-1)/mg MBC g(-1)). A case is made for gaps as alleviators of old growth forest soil C saturation. Relative to the undisturbed closed forest, gaps have significantly less labile C, significantly greater in situ surface C efflux, and significantly lower decreased qCO(2) values.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				APR	2008	11	3					426	441		10.1007/s10021-008-9131-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-008-9131-6													WOS:000255537400006
J	Sjöling, S; Cowan, DA				Sjöling, S; Cowan, DA			High 16S rDNA bacterial diversity in glacial meltwater lake sediment, Bratina Island, Antarctica	EXTREMOPHILES												The microbial diversity in maritime meltwater pond sediments from Bratina Island, Ross Sea, Antarctica was investigated by 16S rDNA-dependent molecular phylogeny. Investigations of the vertical distribution, phylogenetic composition, and spatial variability of Bacteria and Archaea in the sediment were carried out. Results revealed the presence of a highly diverse bacterial population and a significantly depth-related composition. Assessment of 173 partial 16S rDNA clones analyzed by amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) using tetrameric restriction enzymes (HinP1I 5'GdelCGC3'and Msp I. 5'CdelCGG3', BioLabs) revealed 153 different bacterial OTUs (operational taxonomic units). However, only seven archaeal OTUs were detected, indicating low archaeal diversity. Based on ARDRA results, 30 bacterial clones were selected for sequencing and the sequenced clones fell into seven major lineages of the domain Bacteria; the alpha, gamma, and delta subdivisions of Proteobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides, the Spirochaetaceae, and the Actinobacteria. All of the archaeal clones sequenced belonged to the group Crenarchaeota and phylogenetic analysis revealed close relationships with members of the deep-branching Group 1 Marine Archaea.

J	Young, KL; Brown, LC				Young, Kathy L.; Brown, Laura C.			Thermal regime of High Arctic tundra ponds, Nanuit Itillinga (Polar Bear Pass), Nunavut, Canada	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												This study evaluates the seasonal and inter-seasonal temperature regime of small tundra ponds ubiquitous to an extensive, low-gradient wetland in the Canadian High Arctic. Pond temperatures can modify evaporation and ground thaw rates, impact losses of greenhouse gases, and control the timing and emergence of insects and larvae critical for migratory-bird feeding habits. We focus our study on thaw ponds with a range of hydrologic linkages and sizes across Nanuit Itillinga, formerly known as Polar Bear Pass (PBP), Bathurst Island, and compare their thermal signals to other Arctic ponds. Pond temperatures and water levels were evaluated using temperature and water level loggers and verified by regular manual measurements. Other environmental data collected included microclimate, frost table depths, and water conductivity. Our results show that there is much variability in pond thermal regimes over seasons, years, and space. Cumulative relative pond temperatures were similar across years, with ponds normally reaching 10-15 degrees C for short to longer periods, except in 2013, which experienced a cold summer season during which pond temperatures never exceeded 5 degrees C. Pond frost tables and water conductivities respond to variable substrate conditions and pond thermal patterns. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on climate warming and its impact on Arctic landscapes.					; Brown, Laura/F-5932-2011	Brown, Laura/0000-0002-3173-8433; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				AUG 28	2024	28	16					3931	3945		10.5194/hess-28-3931-2024	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3931-2024													WOS:001299156500001

Hence, we investigated the frequency of NDV in both non-migratory and birds migrating on the Black Sea-Mediterranean flyway, in Istanbul, Turkey. Birds were trapped using nets placed around the Kucukcekmece lake Avcilar, Istanbul, in spring seasons of 2016 and 2018. In total, 297 birds belonging to 42 different species were trapped, categorized according to species and sex, and flocked oropharyngeal swabs were collected. In addition, flocked swabs were also collected from 115 mallards caught by hunters around Edirne and from 207 birds which had been treated in the Veterinary Faculty of Istanbul university-Cerrahpasa. Tissue samples were taken from dead wild birds brought by public to Veterinary Faculty. A total of 619 flocked oropharyngeal swabs were pooled into 206 samples. RNA was extracted from swabs and tissue samples. Real-time RT-PCR prob. assay was used to detect NDV-RNA in samples. Results There was no amplification in real time RT-PCR in samples taken from wild birds caught by traps. However, amplification of NDV-F gene was observed in oropharyngeal swabs taken from 2 waterfowls (Common Moorhen and Mallard), and in tissue samples taken from 2 little owls and 1 common kestrel. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of these 5 samples for NDV-F gene showed great similarity with NDV subgenotype VII.2 viruses. Analysis also showed that there is a high similarity with the F gene sequences previously reported from Turkey in 2012 and as well as the sequences from neighbouring countries Bulgaria and Georgia and geographically close country such as Pakistan. Although the strains found in this study are closely related, there is a relatively small degree of molecular divergence within 543 bp of F gene of the Turkish NDV isolate and strains detected in Israel, Pakistan, Iran, United Arab Emirates and Belgium. Conclusions Our findings revealed the presence of subgenotype VII.2 of NDVs in wild birds in north west of Turkey and demonstrated some degree of molecular evolution when compared to the earlier NDV-VII.2 isolate in Turkey.

J	Keller, B; Soto, D				Keller, B; Soto, D			Hydrogeologic influences on the preservation of Orestias ascotanensis (Teleostei: Cyprinodontidae), in Salar de Ascotan, northern Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Orestias ascotanensis Parenti 1984, is a small native fish found in isolated freshwater pools at Salar de Ascotan. Other Orestias are found in freshwater lakes in the Altiplano to the north, separated by hundreds of kilometers of desert. The distribution of fish in the Salar is limited by freshwater availability and thus the populations are located within very short extension (less than 1 000 m) on each spring and pool. The fish apparently arrived at Ascotan during a high stand at the last glacial maximum (LGM, similar to 17 ka) of Lake Minchin, which filled the internal drainage of the Altiplano. During Holocene time, with drier climate, the Ascotan pools have been maintained by groundwater flow which includes recharge from the Ascotan topographic basin and from recharge in Pastes Grandes Caldera, a Miocene-Pliocene ignimbrite center at higher elevation to the east. Such hydrogeologic features create a permanent water supply allowing the preservation of a unique landscape and biota including the small and very isolated populations of Orestias.																			0716-078X					JUN	1998	71	2					147	156																WOS:000075723100004

A total of 41 fish specimens were examined between May and November 2023. Parasitological analyses revealed three parasite species: Dactyfogyrus extensus, Dactyfogyrus anchoratus, and Ichthyophthirius muftififiis, with an overall infection rate of 75.6%. D. extensus exhibited the highest prevalence, infecting 65.9% of the fish, while D. anchoratus was present in 48.8% of the specimens. Additionally, I. muftififiis, the causative agent of white spot disease, was detected in only one specimen, though with a very high intensity. D. extensus exhibited the highest prevalence duringsummer, while D. anchoratus was more dominant in autumn. Statistical analyses indicated a significant positive correlation between parasite load and dissolved oxygen levels (r = 0.514, p = 0.010) and host size (r = 0.592, p < 0.01). However, no significant difference was found in condition factor between infected and non-infected fish (p = 0.653). These findings highlight the ecological dynamics of parasite-host interactions in an artificialfreshwater ecosystem and emphasize the importance of continuous monitoringto understand the impact of environmental conditions on parasite prevalence.																				2602-473X					2025	40	4					205	212		10.26650/ASE.2025.1656372	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/ASE.2025.1656372													WOS:001592924300001

Antarctic lakes are microbially dominated ecosystems supporting truncated food webs in which viruses exert a major influence on the microbial loop. Here we report the discovery of a virophage (relative of the recently described Sputnik virophage) that preys on phycodnaviruses that infect prasinophytes (phototrophic algae). By performing metaproteogenomic analysis on samples from Organic Lake, a hypersaline meromictic lake in Antarctica, complete virophage and near-complete phycodnavirus genomes were obtained. By introducing the virophage as an additional predator of a predator-prey dynamic model we determined that the virophage stimulates secondary production through the microbial loop by reducing overall mortality of the host and increasing the frequency of blooms during polar summer light periods. Virophages remained abundant in the lake 2 y later and were represented by populations with a high level of major capsid protein sequence variation (25-100% identity). Virophage signatures were also found in neighboring Ace Lake (in abundance) and in two tropical lakes (hypersaline and fresh), an estuary, and an ocean upwelling site. These findings indicate that virophages regulate host-virus interactions, influence overall carbon flux in Organic Lake, and play previously unrecognized roles in diverse aquatic ecosystems.

The limits of variability of this optical characteristic in three layers of the lake (the upper mixed layer, the temperature jump layer and below it) were determined. The pre-estuary areas and deepwater regions down to a probing depth of 150 m were studied separately.

This study uses a hybrid approach in the construction of region-specific economic impact models for the Morice Lakes Innovative Forest Practices Agreement Area, the McGregor Model Forest Region, and the larger combination of the two regions. The results will also identify the impacts on the rest of the province. The hybrid approach involves the collection of secondary data to mechanically regionalize provincial data, and the collection of primary data in the form of a business survey examining economic activity to improve the regional nature of the models through a process of superior data insertion. The surveys and model construction are currently underway and the comprehensive project results will be available in the summer of 2004.																			0830-0453		0-662-38389-3				2004	399						278	281																WOS:000226974200029
J	Matthes, M				Matthes, M			Low genotypic diversity in a Daphnia pulex population in a biomanipulated lake:: the lack of vertical and seasonal variability	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th International Symposium on Cladocera	AUG 19-23, 2002	Wierzba, POLAND					Allozyme diversity of a population of D. pulex was studied over two seasons in a small lake (Grafenhain, Saxony, Germany). In this eutrophic lake, accumulation of hydrogen sulfide during winter ice covers leads to an annual killing-off of cladocerans. Hence, the population must be re-established every year by hatchlings from sexual eggs. The absence of planktivorous fish due to strong biomanipulation ensures high abundances of Daphnia from June until September. Besides the investigation of seasonal changes of genotype diversity, vertical differences between individuals from the epilimnion and from a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) were studied. Specimens were classified by allozyme electrophoresis using six allozyme loci. Except for aldehyde oxidase (AO) all tested allozyme loci were monomorphic. Two alleles were found at the AO-locus in the overall study, allowing the population to be subdivided into three clonegroups (ss, fs, ff). The proportion of each clonegroup both in the epilimnion and in the DCM did not vary over the two seasons and no differences were found in the year-to-year comparison. Although two completely different habitats (epilimnion, DCM) were found to be used by D. pulex, clonal structure in both depth strata was similar at all times indicating no intraspecific segregation of the population. In spite of a non-permanent population with periodical sexual reproduction, a constant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg-equilibrium was detected in the overall study. This remarkable genetic structure is interpreted to be the result of both founder effects and a strong and long-lasting selection pressure caused by 15 years of stationary conditions due to intense biomanipulation.																			0018-8158					SEP	2004	526	1			SI		33	42		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041616.86446.01	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041616.86446.01													WOS:000223915900005

However, reported effects of small dams on water temperature are variable, likely due to differences in landscape and dam characteristics. To quantify the range of thermal effects of small dams, we deployed continuous temperature loggers for one to four years at 30 dam sites across a range of environmental settings throughout Massachusetts (USA). Most dams (67%) warmed downstream waters, with August mean temperatures 0.20-5.25 degrees C higher than upstream. Downstream temperatures cooled with increased distance from the dam at 68% of sites, such that the warmest temperatures were observed closest to the dam. Where there was both a significant downstream warming effect and cooling pattern (seven sites), elevated temperatures persisted for an average of 1.31 km downstream of the dam. Dams with impoundments that caused the greatest relative widening of the stream channel and those on coldwater streams had the most warming, while streams with short dams in forested watersheds cooled most quickly downstream of the dam. Flow had a homogenizing effect on water temperatures at over half of the sites, whereby summer thermal impacts were more pronounced (e.g., more warming, faster cooling rates) under periods of lower flows. Downstream warming may reduce habitat for coldwater fishes and invertebrates, particularly where dams shift coldwater/coolwater habitat to warmwater. These results suggest that dam removal may mitigate elevated stream temperatures and increase ecosystem resilience in the face of a changing climate via restoration of critical coldwater habitats.

Carbon isotopic composition of intact branched GDGT core lipids in Greenland lake sediments and soils	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are the basis of the MBT and CBT indices used as proxies for past changes in temperature and soil pH. Although these compounds were initially thought to originate solely from anaerobic soil bacteria, there is now convincing evidence that they are also produced within aquatic environments. However, the specific source organism(s) remain unknown. We utilize here spooling wire microcombustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SWiM-IRMS) to measure the delta C-13 composition of intact brGDGTs from a series of lake sediments and soils, including samples exhibiting in situ production of brGDGTs. The results show close parallels between the delta(13)CbrGDGT values and OM in the downcore profiles for sediment sequences from two lakes. In addition, the delta(13)CbrGDGT values were consistently more negative than those of OM for the lakes and soil samples from the surrounding watershed. The values are consistent with a mixture of heterotrophic sources and preferential utilization of delta C-13-depleted carbon sources. The delta C-13 values of individual brGDGT components confirm in situ production of brGDGTs within lacustrine dysoxic environments and suggest that their association with an elevated CH4 level during the summer may reflect methanotrophy.

Based on eight combined schemes, including two common WRF surface layer schemes (MM5 and Eta) and urban canopy schemes (SLAB, UCM, BEP and BEP + BEM), simulation performance for 2-m temperature, 2-m relative humidity and 10-m wind during a heatwave in July 2019 was compared and analyzed. The simulation performance is ranked from best to worst: 2-m temperature, 2-m relative humidity, 10-m wind direction and 10-m wind speed. MM5 simulate 2-m temperature and 10-m wind speed better than Eta, but 2-m relative humidity worse. MM5 coupling BEP + BEM provides the highest simulation performance for 2-m air temperature, 10-m wind direction and 10-m wind speed but the worst for 2-m relative humidity. MM5 and Eta produce nearly opposite results for wind direction and wind speed. Due to the Anxin station close to Baiyang Lake, lake-land breeze affects the simulation findings, worsening the correlation between simulated 10-m wind and observation.

Heavy cyanobacterial blooms outbreak in Lake Taihu in summer annually and vanish in other months. To find out the factors impacting the cyanobacterial blooms, the present study measured the physicochemical parameters of water and investigated the composition of microbial community using the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing in the months with or without bloom. The most interesting finding is that two major cyanobacteria, Planktothrix and Microcystis, dramatically alternated during a cyanobacterial bloom in 2016, which is less mentioned in previous studies. When the temperature of the water began increasing in July, Planktothrix appeared first and showed as a superior competitor for M. aeruginosa in NO3--rich conditions. Microcystis became the dominant genus when the water temperature increased further in August. Laboratory experiments confirmed the influence of temperature and the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) form on the growth of Planktothrix and Microcystis in a co-culture system. Besides, species interactions between cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacterial microorganisms, especially the prokaryotes, also played a key role in the alteration of Planktothrix and Microcystis. The present study exhibited the alteration of two dominant cyanobacteria in the different bloom periods caused by the temperature, TDN forms as well as the species interactions. These results helped the better understanding of cyanobacterial blooms and the factors which contribute to them.

Colony formation in the cyanobacterium Microcystis	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Morphological evolution from a unicellular to multicellular state provides greater opportunities for organisms to attain larger and more complex living forms. As the most common freshwater cyanobacterial genus, Microcystis is a unicellular microorganism, with high phenotypic plasticity, which forms colonies and blooms in lakes and reservoirs worldwide. We conducted a systematic review of field studies from the 1990s to 2017 where Microcystis was dominant. Microcystis was detected as the dominant genus in waterbodies from temperate to subtropical and tropical zones. Unicellular Microcystis spp. can be induced to form colonies by adjusting biotic and abiotic factors in laboratory. Colony formation by cell division has been induced by zooplankton filtrate, high Pb2+ concentration, the presence of another cyanobacterium (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii), heterotrophic bacteria, and by low temperature and light intensity. Colony formation by cell adhesion can be induced by zooplankton grazing, high Ca2+ concentration, and microcystins. We hypothesise that single cells of all Microcystis morphospecies initially form colonies with a similar morphology to those found in the early spring. These colonies gradually change their morphology to that of M. ichthyoblabe, M. wesenbergii and M. aeruginosa with changing environmental conditions. Colony formation provides Microcystis with many ecological advantages, including adaption to varying light, sustained growth under poor nutrient supply, protection from chemical stressors and protection from grazing. These benefits represent passive tactics responding to environmental stress. Microcystis colonies form at the cost of decreased specific growth rates compared with a unicellular habit. Large colony size allows Microcystis to attain rapid floating velocities (maximum recorded for a single colony, similar to 10.08 m h(-1)) that enable them to develop and maintain a large biomass near the surface of eutrophic lakes, where they may shade and inhibit the growth of less-buoyant species in deeper layers. Over time, accompanying species may fail to maintain viable populations, allowing Microcystis to dominate. Microcystis blooms can be controlled by artificial mixing. Microcystis colonies and non-buoyant phytoplankton will be exposed to identical light conditions if they are evenly distributed over the water column. In that case, green algae and diatoms, which generally have a higher growth rate than Microcystis, will be more successful. Under such mixing conditions, other phytoplankton taxa could recover and the dominance of Microcystis would be reduced. This review advances our understanding of the factors and mechanisms affecting Microcystis colony formation and size in the field and laboratory through synthesis of current knowledge. The main transition pathways of morphological changes in Microcystis provide an example of the phenotypic plasticity of organisms during morphological evolution from a unicellular to multicellular state. We emphasise that the mechanisms and factors influencing competition among various close morphospecies are sometimes paradoxical because these morphospecies are potentially a single species. Further work is required to clarify the colony-forming process in different Microcystis morphospecies and the seasonal variation in this process. This will allow researchers to grow laboratory cultures that more closely reflect field morphologies and to optimise artificial mixing to manage blooms more effectively.

N2 fixation exceeds internal nitrogen loading as a phytoplankton nutrient source in perpetually nitrogen-limited reservoirs	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Biological N-2 fixation hypothetically could balance the N:P supply ratio in lakes and reservoirs, causing P to be the ultimate limiting element. However, the efficiency and time scale of this mechanism has been poorly studied and remains largely unknown. We compared the relative rates of N supply to the epilimnion of 3 reservoirs of similar age and morphology but with differing external nutrient inputs. Our objective was to determine if N-2-fixation rates in these reservoirs exceeded other internal N supply pathways during the growing season, a situation that would suggest that these systems are still evolving in terms of nutrient-limitation status. Phytoplankton N-2-fixation rates ranged from 3.4 to 16 g N m(-2) y(-1) in the reservoirs. These rates are among the highest N-2-fixation rates reported in the scientific literature. Measureable N-2 fixation also occurred in sediments in contact with reservoir epilimnia (0.85-1.5 g N m(-2) y(-1)). Sediment N-2-fixation rates exceeded rates of N regeneration from epilimnetic sediments (0.10-0.24 g N m(-2) y(-1)), a result suggesting that much of this fixed N either accumulates seasonally in sediments or is lost via coupled nitrification-denitrification. NH4+ flux from hypolimnia (0.13-1.8 g N m(-2) y(-1)) and lower metalimnia (similar to 0.00-1.8 g N m(-2) y(-1)) was a substantial internal N supply to epilimnia during summer stratification. However, phytoplankton N-2-fixation rates always exceeded rates of N input from these internal sources. These findings suggest that, even though the annual cycle of ecosystem N inputs via N-2 fixation has occurred over many years or decades in these reservoirs, reactive N accumulation has not been sufficient to alleviate seasonal N deficiency and lead to perpetual P limitation of phytoplankton.

Each species was represented by individuals from a clear (greenish) and a humic (dark brown) lake in southern Finland: Lake Vesijarvi (LV; peak transmission around 570 nm) and Lake Tuusulanjarvi (LT; peak transmission around 630 nm). In the autumn, all species had almost purely A2-based visual pigments. Rod absorption spectra peaked at c.526 nm (S. lucioperca), c. 533 nm (E. lucius) and c. 540 nm (P. fluviatilis and R. rutilus), with no differences between the lakes. Esox lucius rods had remarkably long outer segments, 1.5-2.8-fold longer than those of the other species. All species possessed middle-wavelength-sensitive (MWS) and long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) cone pigments in single, twin or double cones. Rutilus rutilus also had two types of short-wavelength sensitive (SWS) cones: UV-sensitive [SWS1] and blue-sensitive (SWS2) cones, although in the samples from LT no UV cones were found. No other within-species differences in photoreceptor cell complements, absorption spectra or morphologies were found between the lakes. However, E. lucius eyes had a significantly lower focal ratio in LT compared with LV, enhancing sensitivity at the expense of acuity in the dark-brown lake. Comparing species, S. lucioperca was estimated to have the highest visual sensitivity, at least two times higher than similar-sized E. lucius, thanks to the large relative size of the eye (pupil) and the presence of a reflecting tapetum behind the retina. High absolute sensitivity will give a competitive edge also in terms of short reaction times and long visual range.					; Viljanen, Martta/AAG-6894-2019	Donner, Kristian/0000-0001-7833-4236; Viljanen, Martta/0000-0001-7363-6729; Nevala, Noora Emilia/0000-0001-5018-3157; 													0022-1112	1095-8649				JUL	2019	95	1			SI		200	213		10.1111/jfb.13759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.13759								30047140					WOS:000475682700011

Seasonal effects of zebra mussels on littoral nitrogen transformation rates in Gull Lake, Michigan, USA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are successful colonisers of lake littoral habitats and they interact strongly with littoral benthos. Previous research suggests that localised areas colonised by zebra mussels may be hotspots of nitrogen (N) cycling. The effects of zebra mussels on nitrification and denitrification rates were examined approximately every other month for 1 year in Gull Lake, Michigan, U.S.A. Littoral sediment was collected from an area free of zebra mussels and distributed into shallow trays; rocks colonised with zebra mussels were placed in half of the trays, while uncolonised rocks were placed in the remaining trays. After an incubation period of 6-8 weeks in the lake, sediment and zebra mussels were collected from the trays, replaced with new sediment and zebra mussels, and placed in the lake for the next interval. In the laboratory, sediment nitrification and denitrification rates were measured for each tray. Sediment nitrification rates did not increase in the presence of zebra mussels; instead nitrification rates were sensitive to changes in water temperature and increased with increasing exchangeable sediment ammonium. In contrast, denitrification rates increased in sediment trays with zebra mussels in the winter when nitrate (NO3-) availability was high and when Chara did not grow in the trays. Sediment denitrification was NO3--limited in all seasons, regardless of zebra mussel treatment. However, sediment in the presence of zebra mussels responded less to NO3- addition, suggesting that NO3- limitation of denitrification can be reduced by zebra mussel activity. Zebra mussels have a seasonally variable impact on sediment denitrification rates, and this may translate into altered seasonal patterns of N cycling in localised areas of lakes where they are particularly abundant.

J	Chapman, LJ; Chapman, CA; Crisman, TL; Nordlie, FG				Chapman, LJ; Chapman, CA; Crisman, TL; Nordlie, FG			Dissolved oxygen and thermal regimes of a Ugandan crater lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper quantifies the temporal pattern of thermal stratification and deoxygenation in Lake Nkuruba, a small (3 ha), deep (maximum depth = 38 m) crater lake in western Uganda. Dissolved oxygen penetrated to an average depth of 9 m and a maximum depth of 15 m below which the lake was permanently anoxic over the 2 years of study. Although surface oxygen levels were correlated with both surface water temperature and rainfall, seasonal cycles of dissolved oxygen were not well-defined and may have been obscured by the high frequency of short-term fluctuations and by inter-annual variations caused by shifts in rainfall. Surface water temperature averaged 23.3+/-0.7 degrees C (S.D.) and varied directly with air temperature. Both diurnal changes and top-bottom temperature differentials were small averaging 1.7+/-0.7 degrees C and 1.6+/-0.8 degrees C, respectively. Thermal stability ranged from 101.3 to 499.9 g-cm cm(-2) and was positively related to surface water temperature suggesting that this small protected lake responds rapidly to short-term meteorological changes. Because contribution to the annual heat exchange cycle was confined to upper waters, the lake's annual heat budget was low, 1,073.8 cal cm-2 yr-l. However, net primary productivity was relatively high averaging 1.3 g C m(-2) d(-1). The region where Lake Nkuruba is situated experienced a very strong earthquake (6.2 on the Richter scale) on 4 February, 1994. Subsequently, water levels dropped markedly in the lake, falling 3.14 m over a 5-month period.

J	Luoto, TP				Luoto, Tomi P.			Subfossil Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) along a latitudinal gradient in Finland: development of a new temperature inference model	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Numerical techniques were used to study chironomid distribution and abundance in lakes from a 1000km transect in Finland, with special interest on the effect of local summer air temperatures on chironomid assemblages. The final aim of the study was to develop a chironomid-based paleotemperature inference model. The dataset consisted of 82 lakes (of which 77 were used in the model after deletion Of Outliers), with catchments spanning from boreal coniferous forests to mountain birch woodland and tundra vegetation. Numerical analysis showed that the mean July air temperature was the most significant variable explaining the distribution and abundance of Journal of Quaternary Science chironomids in Finnish lakes. Weighted-averaging partial least squares techniques were used to develop a palaeotemperature inference model for mean July air temperature reconstructions. The model performance statistics were favourable, with cross-validated coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 0.78, root mean squared error of prediction of 0.721 degrees C and maximum bias of 0.794 degrees C. Based on these values, the transfer function is a valid means of performing quantitative palaeotemperature estimates in downcore studies. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Branfireun, BA; Roulet, NT				Branfireun, BA; Roulet, NT			The baseflow and storm flow hydrology of a precambrian shield headwater peatland	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A hydrological investigation was conducted in a small headwater peatland located in the Experimental Lakes Area, north-western Ontario, Canada, to determine the subsurface and surface flow paths within the peatland, and between the peatland and an adjacent forested upland during baseflow and storm flow conditions. Distinct zones of groundwater recharge and discharge were observed within the peatland. These zones are similar to those found in much larger flow systems even though the peatland was only influenced by local groundwater flow. Groundwater emerging in seeps and flowing beneath the peatland sustained the surface wetness of the peatland and maintained a constant baseflow. The response of the peatland stream to summer rain events was controlled by peatland water table position when the basin was dry and antecedent moisture storage on the uplands when the basin was wet. The magnitude and timing of peak runoff during wet conditions were controlled by the degree of hydrological connectivity between the surrounding upland terrain and the peatland.

J	Street, JH; Anderson, RS; Paytan, A				Street, Joseph H.; Anderson, R. Scott; Paytan, Adina			An organic geochemical record of Sierra Nevada climate since the LGM from Swamp Lake, Yosemite	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediment records from Swamp Lake (SL) in the central Sierra Nevada, California, provide evidence of climatic change on millennial and centennial timescales over the last similar to 20,000 years. Total organic carbon (TOC) abundance varied in concert with elemental and isotopic tracers of organic matter (C/N, delta C-13(org), delta N-15), biogenic silica content, total magnetic susceptibility, and sediment lithology. We interpret the down-core proxy records as representing the response of the lake environment, in terms of temperature, seasonal ice cover, mixing regimes, runoff and in situ OM and nutrient cycling, to shifting climate states. These environmental factors in turn drove changes in algal productivity, OM sources, microbial OM regeneration and secondary production, and detrital input. The late Pleistocene (similar to 19.7-10.8 cal. kyr BP) was dominated by fluctuations between relatively warm/dry intervals with high TOC (17.4-16.5, 15.8-15.0, 13.9-13.2, 11.4-11.0 cal. kyr BP) and cold/wet intervals (16.5-15.8, 14.8-13.9, 13.1-11.6, 11.0-10.7 cal. kyr BP) characterized by low TOC and high detrital input. The Holocene (similar to 10.7 cal. kyr BP-present) was characterized by three abrupt increases in TOC (after similar to 10.8, 8.0, and 3.0 cal. kyr BP) and numerous century-scale fluctuations. TOC increases reflected enhanced lake productivity and OM recycling, and reduced detrital input, in response to changing winter temperature and hydrologic regimes. Inferred environmental changes at SL correlate with other Sierra Nevada paleorecords, and with reconstructed sea surface temperatures along the California margin. Parallel changes in the SL and SST records over the past similar to 20,000 years provide new evidence that continental climate in the Sierra Nevada and the California Current system have responded, on multiple timescales, to common drivers in North Pacific ocean-atmospheric circulation.

Early microhabitat use by age 0 year brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis in lakes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The early habitat use of age 0 year brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis in three north temperate lakes which differ in terms of shoreline physical habitat is described. In the two lakes, which contained abundant shoreline woody debris and inundated vegetation, brook charr were observed in extremely close proximity with these habitat features, near shore and near the surface. Fish were absent from open areas away from shore unless in close proximity with fallen floating logs near the surface, extending offshore. In a third lake that had no woody debris or inundated shoreline vegetation, brook charr were observed exclusively in close proximity with the shoreline itself, and near the surface. In all three lakes, fish were most closely associated with the shoreline and with woody debris and inundated vegetation (when present) shortly after emergence, and significantly farther from shore and deeper in the water column thereafter.

Planktons are sensitive to different environmental conditions and good indicators of water quality. Study was carried out on phytoplankton and some physicochemical properties of Narikulam water reservoir during summer 2011. In the present study, phytoplankton density, diversity, compositions were considered for ecological monitoring and water quality assessment. Samples were collected from 12 different locations on two consecutive days. The identifications, compositions and diversity index analyses were carried out in the laboratory. Five phytoplankton groups were identified in the water samples comprising 48 genera. Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae and Dinophyceae were found in the decreasing abundance. Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (SWI) values varied from 1.97 to 3.78, with one outlier indicating moderate to good levels of phytoplankton diversity. No remarkable organic pollution was indicated by Palmer's Pollution Index (2-12) in reservoir. The study revealed that Narikulam water reservoir was apparently unpolluted and free from adverse environmental conditions; therefore, water was suitable for domestic use and irrigation.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				DEC	2018	4	4					735	743		10.1007/s40899-017-0158-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-017-0158-8													WOS:000461221800006

Phytoplankton and phytobenthos pigment strategies: implications for algal survival in the changing Arctic	POLAR BIOLOGY												We compared phytoplankton and phytobenthos pigment strategies in 17 shallow lakes and ponds from northern Canada and Alaska, sampled during mid to late summer. Benthic chlorophyll a concentrations (8-261 mg m(-2)) greatly exceeded those of the phytoplankton (0.008-1.4 mg m(-2)) in all sites. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytobenthos, while green algae and fucoxanthin-groups characterized the plankton. Both communities had higher photoprotection in cold, UV-transparent, high latitude waters. Phytoplankton had higher concentrations of photoprotective carotenoids per unit chlorophyll a than the phytobenthos. The planktonic photoprotective pigments were positively correlated with UV-penetration, and inversely correlated with temperature and coloured dissolved organic matter. A partial redundancy analysis showed that the benthic pigments were related to latitude, area and temperature. The UV-screening compound scytonemin occurred in high concentrations in the phytobenthos and was inversely related to temperature, while benthic carotenoids per unit chlorophyll a showed much lower variability among sites. These differing pigment strategies imply divergent responses to environmental change between the phytobenthos and phytoplankton in high latitude lakes.

J	Shankman, D; Lai, XJ				Shankman, David; Lai, Xijun			Severe flood probability on the middle Changjiang (Yangtze River) after completion of the Three Gorges Dam	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												A major justification for building the Three Gorges Dam on the Changjiang is flood control. The dam can reduce peak discharge during severe floods. These floods, however, cannot be prevented by operation of the Three Gorges Dam alone. During the most severe floods abnormally high rainfall occurs throughout the Changjiang basin. The Three Gorges Dam can only affect discharge from the upper basin. Large tributaries on the middle Changjiang are unaffected by the dam. The cumulative impact of high discharge from large tributaries on the middle Changjiang increase flood severity with distance downstream. Also, Changjiang-lake interaction is affected by decreasing volume of Poyang and Dongting Lakes that occurred during the past few decades. These are the largest freshwater lakes in China. As a result of reduced floodwater storage capacity during summer high discharge periods, tributaries flow into the lakes with a higher base level than previously occurred. Instead of Changjiang back flowing into the lakes as previously expected during major floods, high Changjiang discharge occurs at the same time as high tributary discharge that increases peak river stage.

Here, we present a reconstruction of Holocene global volcanism based on the anomalies in Hg concentrations, accumulation fluxes, and Hg/C ratios in three high-resolution peat profiles spanning Eurasia. Our reconstruction reveals that the two Tibetan peat profiles recorded 33 major explosive volcanic eruptions (with 11 eruptions being synchronously detected), which correspond with a French Pyrenees peat record and sulfate anomalies in polar ice cores. Additionally, the major explosive volcanic eruptions recorded in the TP peat profiles coincided with abrupt decreases in solar irradiance during the Holocene, suggesting these eruptions might have had a greater global climate impact. Our results suggest the atmospheric transport of volcanic Hg within the Northern Hemisphere and underscore the significant role played by major explosive volcanic eruptions in precipitating abrupt global climate and environmental changes during the Holocene. This study has implications for deciphering the configuration of volcanic eruption seasons, locations, and magnitudes during the Holocene and aligning the chronology of peat deposits with ice cores.

Six (15%) tagged burbot were never relocated after release, and an additional seven (17.5%) of the tagged burbot either died or shed their tag within 60 d after release. We relocated 34 marked burbot (85%) on at least three occasions (mean = 10.0). Burbot frequently used the deepest portions of the reservoir, especially during the summer months. We estimated that the mean 50%, 75%, and 90% kernel home ranges were 14.6, 22.6 and 32.3 km(2), respectively. We found no evidence that burbot home range differed within the 2 years of this study. Although we did observe burbot moving a maximum distance of up to 64.3 km, we were unable to discern any general movement patterns by month or capture location. Individual burbot tagged in this study had relatively high fidelity to the original capture side of the reservoir, and almost half of our marked burbot were never relocated on the opposite side of the remnant Kootenai River thalweg, and those that did cross the thalweg do so infrequently. One burbot was entrained through Libby Dam approximately 134-276 d after capture and tagging.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-98-8				2008	59						43	54																WOS:000253841600003

Modeling net effects of transit operations on vehicle miles traveled, fuel consumption, carbon dioxide, and criteria air pollutant emissions in a mid-size US metro area: findings from Salt Lake City, UT	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) serves Utah's Wasatch Front, a rapidly growing conurbation with a current population of similar to 1.8M people. UTA uses an electronic fare collection (EFC) system that requires riders to tap on as they enter a bus or train and tap off as they exit, as well as an automated passenger counter (APC) system that counts interruptions of infrared beams across vehicle doorways as riders board and alight. We analyzed EFC and APC data for 2016, along with service schedules and routes from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, to estimate the impact of UTA on the air quality in its service region by accounting for vehicle miles traveled, gasoline gallons equivalent of fuel consumed, and multiple pollutant species emitted. Buses, light rail, and commuter rail were found to collectively offset approximately 1.5% of the on road emissions from the counties served by UTA due to transit use replacing single passenger vehicle use. These offsets are not homogeneous; ridership drops significantly (similar to 20%-50% depending on the mode) during the summer months as some of the largest users are educational institutions with noticeable seasonal cycles. Low transit use during the weekend negates some of the air quality benefits as buses and trains travel at lower capacity. Central routes, particularly during peak travel hours provide noticeable congestion, fuel consumption, and pollutant emissions reduction due to trips taken by transit replacing personal vehicles but off-peak, and non-central routes, show lower benefits. Because the light rail is electric, its local air quality benefits are significant due to the electricity being produced primarily outside the airshed. Upgrading the bus fleet to 2010 model, and newer, diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, as well as modeling an envisioned change to Tier 3 locomotives for the commuter rail system, was found to significantly reduce regional nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulatematter (PM2.5), and sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions.

J	IVANOVA, NL				IVANOVA, NL			VARIABILITY OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF LAKE FROG (RANA-RIDIBUNDA PALL) LARVAE KEPT UNDER EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS	SOVIET JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The growth and development of lake frog larvae, obtained from roe laid in different times of the year - March (early spawns), May (summer), and July-August (late) - were studied. The reproductive characteristics are reflected in the fact that larvae at all stages of development are present in bodies of water during the vegetation period. The difference in time between completion of emergence on dry land of the young from early and late spawns may be up to four months. The different duration of the period of life on land leads to the fact that the new generation of the current year's frogs is simultaneously represented by animals of different sizes. Such size heterogeneity may promote an expansion of the trophic niche. The data obtained suggest that depending on the periods of spawning, several morphologically different groups of animals may be formed in the lake frog population.																			0096-7807					SEP-OCT	1991	22	5					309	313																WOS:A1991JB59400008

In this study, sand dredging numbers were evaluated by the accumulated radiance algorithm using the night-time light composite data of the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite, and the PSD slope was derived by band ratio algorithm of Landsat-8/operational land imager (OLI) imagery. Then, the influence of sand mining on PSD slope was analyzed. We draw several crucial findings. First, the ratio of R-rs(Red) to R-rs(Green) based on OLI imagery was capable of retrieving PSD slope with good robustness (R-2 - 0.71, p < 0.01, n = 41) and verified acceptance (mean absolute percentage error = 4.29%, root mean square error = 0.19, n = 20), and the PSD slope in HZL was lower in summer than in the other seasons from 2014 to 2017. Second, The night active vessels extracted from the night-time images show that sand dredging activities began at the outlet of Chengzi Lake (CZL) in April 2012, spread to the whole lake between 2014 and 2016, and then stopped in the northeast region in March 2017 due to the strict control of the local government. Third, the PSD slope is strongly influenced by sand mining, which is positively correlated with the number of sand dredgers (R-2 = 0.92), i.e., the PSD slope increases 0.21 per 100 working sand dredgers in CZL.

J	Zhang, HH; Chen, L				Zhang, Honghai; Chen, Lei			Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences reveals distal gut bacterial diversity in wild wolves (Canis lupus)	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS												The aim of this study was to describe the microbial communities in the distal gut of wild wolves (Canis lupus). Fecal samples were collected from three healthy unrelated adult wolves captured at the nearby of Dalai Lake Nature Reserve in Inner Mongolia of China. The diversity of fecal bacteria was investigated by constructing PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene clone libraries using the universal bacterial primers 27 F and 1493 R. A total of 307 non-chimeric near-full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed and 65 non-redundant bacteria phylotypes (operational taxonomical units, OTUs) were identified. Seventeen OTUs (26%) showed less than 98% sequence similarity to 16S rRNA gene sequences were reported previously. Five different bacterial phyla were identified, with the majority of OTUs being classified within the phylum Firmicutes (60%), followed by Bacteroidetes (16.9%), Proteobacteria (9.2%), Fusobacteria (9.2%) and Actinobacteria (4.6%). The majority of clones fell within the order Clostridiales (53.8% of OTUs). It was predominantly affiliated with five families: Lachnospiraceae was the most diverse bacterial family in this order, followed by Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, Peptococcaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae.																			0301-4851	1573-4978				DEC	2010	37	8					4013	4022		10.1007/s11033-010-0060-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0060-z								20306230					WOS:000283577400044

Largemouth bass were displaced over a range of distances (1.5-16.5 km) and their movements and home range characteristics were compared to fish that were not displaced. Displaced largemouth were followed for a year after displacement to determine if they returned close to their site of capture. Disappearance of radio-tagged bass was used to determine seasonal patterns in survival following displacement. It took approximately two weeks for displaced bass to move more than 400 m from the release site. The overall rate of return was 37 percent (7 of 19 fish), with three of the seven bass returning in the spring of the year following displacement. No fish displaced greater than 8 km from their capture site returned to their home range. There was no difference in the home range area, of displaced and nondisplaced bass. Survival over the fishing season was based on the disappearance of radio tags and was estimated by the known fate model of survival analysis. This estimate of survival (Mean S = 0.587; se = 0.099), when combined with estimates of natural mortality for the nonfishing season, points to an apparent improvement in the overall survival rate of largemouth bass in Rideau Lake, relative to data collected twenty years ago.																			0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						525	533																WOS:000180817600042

Infrasound emissions generated by calving events represent a powerful tool for monitoring, quantifying, and understanding the mechanisms that drive glacier retreat. In this study, we present the first acoustic dataset collected over a six-day period during the austral summer at Grey Glacier, located in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile. We provide a detailed description of the instrumentation setup, data acquisition procedures, and signal processing methodologies. By applying high-sensitivity infrasound array processing techniques, we demonstrate that coherent signals generated by calving events can be reliably extracted from the acoustic data, despite environmental conditions, such as strong winds that affect infrasound propagation. This dataset represents a valuable resource for advancing research on cryosphere dynamics and offers practical applications for the glaciological and geophysical communities.																				2052-4463				AUG 27	2025	12	1							1499	10.1038/s41597-025-05778-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-05778-z								40866401					WOS:001559103500003

Using On-Site Angler Surveys and a Geographic Information System for More Effective Marketing of an Urban Fishing Program	URBAN AND COMMUNITY FISHERIES PROGRAMMS: DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATION	American Fisheries Society Symposium				137th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	SEP 02-06, 2007	San Francisco, CA	Amer Fisheries Soc				The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) has implemented an urban fishing program with a goal of introducing angling to demographic groups less likely to participate. One challenge is finding marketing methods that effectively identify and recruit target demographic groups to the program. In December 2005, TPWD began year-round biweekly stockings of adult rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (winter) and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus (other seasons) in eight major metropolitan area lakes throughout Texas. On-site angler surveys were conducted from December 2005 through November 2006 to determine the number of people fishing at the lakes, the degree to which they had previously participated in fishing, and their ZIP code of residence. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) supported by the Environmental Systems Research Institute's (ESRI) ArcGIS (R) software, including ESRI's Business Analyst extension, to geocode each respondent's ZIP code of residence. This allowed us to examine geographic distribution patterns of anglers. The software's databases of census and marketing survey data allowed us to learn about the characteristics of people residing near the lakes, as well as the probable characteristics of respondents as typified by the characteristics of people residing in their ZIP codes areas. We were able to obtain insight into sensitive demographic information (information that some respondents are reluctant to provide during surveys such as income, race, etc.), evaluate our success in targeting the desired groups, and are using information from the GIS to develop marketing strategies that may help us more effectively reach those groups.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-04-2				2008	67						347	358																WOS:000261329900031

Activity patterns were similar between sexes (P > 0.05), but the time allocated to activity categories differed (P < 0.001) throughout the study period. Percentage of time spent feeding in playa wetlands was highest in Sept.-Oct (23%), a period of heavy molt and fat deposition. Resting was the primary activity throughout winter, reaching a peak (67%) in the coldest period (Dec.-Jan.). Courtship and locomotion were highest (P < 0.001) during early morning, resting was highest (P < 0.001) during late morning and afternoon, and feeding was highest (P < 0.05) during late afternoon. Correlations among several climatic variables and activities were tested, with ambient temperature appearing to be most influential. Management suggestions include encouraging the production of natural foods that may be providing nonbreeding green-winged teal with essential resources not available from waste grain.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1984	48	3					838	845		10.2307/3801430	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3801430													WOS:A1984TP34300017

The study area is highly populated with low facilities in the provision of clean drinking water. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to map the spatial variability of different physicochemical parameters. A total of 59 analysed groundwater samples indicated that the ionic concentration was in the order of Na+>Ca2+>Mg2+>K+ for major cations and HCO3->SO42->Cl->NO3->F->CO32- for anions. Traces of arsenic and other toxic elements were found in the vicinity of the industrial zone, but they are well below the designated thresholds. The bivariate Gibbs diagram illustrates that 75-80% of samples fall in the rock-water interaction zone, and the rest of the samples lie in the rock-water interaction and evaporation processes. Piper's plot revealed that seven samples were dominated by alkaline earth metals, seven samples showed the nature of alkalies, and the rest of the samples showed mixed character. Final water quality index (82) shows that the water quality is generally "good", per the NSFWQI classification.

The lake is considered to consist of three different zones: 1) a nearshore stably stratified warm water zone, 2) the thermal bar zone of descending water with temperature approximately equal to that of maximum density, and 3) an offshore cold unstably stratified zone. The basis for the model is the heat budget equation, where horizontal dynamical heat exchange in the vicinity of the bar zone is taken into account. In comparison with a previous model (Zilitinkevich et al. 1991), describing an infinite wedge of water, the present model is more general and takes into account the effect of shore-line curvature. This effect is characterized by a non-dimensional number and causes a marked increase in the displacement rate of the bar at the final stage of its existence. Model predictions are also compared with field data taken from the literature.					; Zilitinkevich, Sergej/L-8465-2015	Zilitinkevich, Sergej/0000-0002-3909-5436; 													0029-1277						1993	24	1					13	30																WOS:A1993LA82800002

The presence of moisture deficits in Miocene New Zealand	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												New Zealand climate during the early to middle Miocene was subtropical to warm-temperate, in contrast to the predominance of cool-temperate climates in New Zealand today. Both modern and Miocene environmental settings of New Zealand are strongly moderated by the surrounding ocean. Seasonal moisture deficits occur today in rain shadow regions in New Zealand, but the potential and nature of seasonal moisture deficits under globally warmer conditions is uncertain. Here, we reconstruct seasonal moisture balance (precipitation - potential evapotranspiration) using seasonal temperature and mean annual precipitation estimates derived from early to middle Miocene (23-11 Ma) fossil leaf assemblages, combined with a Penman-Monteith model for potential evapotranspiration. The model incorporates uncertainty in temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, radiation and wind speed. Our results suggest that three out of nine sites investigated have a very high potential for summer moisture deficits (lowest monthly moisture balance < -90 +/- 40 mm month(-1)), without considering potential differences in infra-annual rainfall. These three sites all have the potential of an annual negative moisture balance (< -230 +/- 460 mm year(-1)). The highest negative moisture balance in New Zealand today is similar to -400 mm year(-1). Additionally, the three sites with the highest potential for moisture deficits all are from the Manuherikia Group, of which the depositional period may partially overlap with the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum. Other sites had moderate (lowest monthly moisture balance < -40 +/- 50 mm month(-1)) to low (lowest monthly moisture balance < 45 +/- 60 mm month(-1)) potential for moisture deficits. Moisture deficit potential appeared to be highly dependent on the reconstructed mean annual precipitation. The trend from the early/middle Miocene to middle/late Miocene boundary of decreasing potential for moisture deficits agrees with a global cooling trend and regional increase in precipitation. Our study highlights the importance of potential evapotranspiration in globally warmer conditions, as seasonal moisture deficits may occur even in environments that are considered strongly ocean-moderated, such as New Zealand.					; Lee, William/KHX-0414-2024	Reichgelt, Tammo/0000-0001-8652-5489; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				JAN	2019	172						268	277		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.10.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.10.013													WOS:000456222800020

For the whole of these lakes 254 taxa were registered allowing a better knowledge of their distribution in the southern hemisphere. A selected subset of 46 dominant taxa was used to perform a cluster analysis of lakes. By taking into consideration both the abundance and distribution of phytoplankton, two distinct groups of lakes could be distinguished: oligotrophic andean lakes on the one hand and meso-eutrophic lakes located in the preandean area and patagonian plateau. Moreover, the same subset of species was clustered yielding algal associations which are characteristic of the different lake types. Statistical analysis showed that phytoplankton density was significantly lower in the andean group of lakes, and for all the lakes studied it was found to be inversely correlated to the relative depth (Z). This paper emphasizes lake morphometry as one of the principal factors influencing the composition and density of phytoplankton.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; O'Farrell, Ines/0000-0002-2236-2905													0181-1568	1776-0984				FEB	1990	11	1					31	46																WOS:A1990CU96800005

Diabolical survival in Death Valley: recent pupfish colonization, gene flow and genetic assimilation in the smallest species range on earth	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												One of the most endangered vertebrates, the Devils Hole pupfish Cyprinodon diabolis, survives in a nearly impossible environment: a narrow subterranean fissure in the hottest desert on earth, Death Valley. This species became a conservation icon after a landmark 1976 US Supreme Court case affirming federal groundwater rights to its unique habitat. However, one outstanding question about this species remains unresolved: how long has diabolis persisted in this hellish environment? We used next-generation sequencing of over 13 000 loci to infer the demographic history of pupfishes in Death Valley. Instead of relicts isolated 2-3 Myr ago throughout repeated flooding of the entire region by inland seas as currently believed, we present evidence for frequent gene flow among Death Valley pupfish species and divergence after the most recent flooding 13 kyr ago. We estimate that Devils Hole was colonized by pupfish between 105 and 830 years ago, followed by genetic assimilation of pelvic fin loss and recent gene flow into neighbouring spring systems. Our results provide a new perspective on an iconic endangered species using the latest population genomic methods and support an emerging consensus that timescales for speciation are overestimated in many groups of rapidly evolving species.					simons, Lee/AAR-6686-2020	Crawford, Jacob/0000-0002-6745-9145; Martin, Christopher/0000-0001-7989-9124													0962-8452	1471-2954				JAN 27	2016	283	1823							20152334	10.1098/rspb.2015.2334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.2334								26817777					WOS:000375858400005

J	Lay, JJ; Li, YY; Noike, T				Lay, JJ; Li, YY; Noike, T			Interaction between homoacetogens and methanogens in lake sediments	JOURNAL OF FERMENTATION AND BIOENGINEERING												The interaction between homoacetogens and methanogens in lake sediments was investigated using hydrogen consumption as an indicator. Sediments samples were obtained from Lake Izunuma, Miyagi prefecture, Japan, a wintering place for migratory birds from Siberia. A batch experiment using H-2/CO2 as a substrate was conducted to determine the acetate generation and methane production potential of the sediments. Incubation for 4 d at 37 degrees C gave the following stoichiometric equation: 88H(2)+ 39HCO(3)(-) + 22H(+) --> 17CH(3)COO(-) + 5CH(4) + 83H(2)O. The activities, upsilon(m), of hydrogen-utilizing homoacetogens and methanogens respectively ranged from 3.2 to 48 and from 1.8 to 3.2 mgCOD.gVSS(-1).h(-1), The population of hydrogen-utilizing homoacetogens was determined to be 2.6 x 10(8) MPN.gVSS(-1), which was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of hydrogen-utilizing methanogens. The results suggest that homoacetogens in the sediments functioned not only as hydrogen consumers but also as major degraders of organic matter, forming acetate as the major reduction product.

J	STIRLING, HP; DEY, T				STIRLING, HP; DEY, T			IMPACT OF INTENSIVE CAGE FISH FARMING ON THE PHYTOPLANKTON AND PERIPHYTON OF A SCOTTISH FRESH-WATER LOCH	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrients, phytoplankton and periphyton were monitored in a 71 ha shallow, unstratified lake used for intensive cage culture of rainbow trout. Inorganic nitrogen, ortho-phosphate and suspended solids were significantly higher near the cages and the bottom and, although declining during summer, nutrients did not reach levels which limit phytoplankton growth. Microcystis aeruginosa dominated the phytoplankton, with surface chlorophyll a reaching 189 .mu.g l-1 in August, but with no subsequent bloom collapse or deoxygenation. A sub-dominant community of ''vernal'' diatoms and Pediastrum spp. persisted. Periphyton was dominated by Melosira italica-subarctica. Algal species and water quality showed the lake to be highly eutrophic. Chlorophyll values predicted from a phosphorus-dependent eutrophication model agreed with observations but light limitation by self-shading and suspended farm wastes, aided by wind-induced turbulence, is believed to control algal growth rates and biomass. Implications for environmental management of intensive freshwater cage farms are discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 15	1990	190	3					193	214		10.1007/BF00008187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008187													WOS:A1990CU06500002

This information is necessary to create physical models of the formation and transfer of atmospheric aerosol fields, taking into account the physical and geographical features of the Baikal region. Measurements were carried out by a lidar LOSA-A2 installed on the scientific -research vessel Academician V.A. Koptyug. The vessel's route passed along the South, Middle and Northern Baikal, from July 15, 2018 to July 26, 2018. At the same time, observations were conducted using lidar LOSA-M2. It was located in the background area at Boyarsky stationary site (51.84 degrees N, 106.06 degrees E), in the south-eastern part of the lake. The results of changes in the spatial structure of atmospheric aerosol fields in background conditions and during forest fires are shown.

J	Rivera-Rondón, CA; Catalan, J				Rivera-Rondon, Carlos A.; Catalan, Jordi			Diatom diversity in the lakes of the Pyrenees: an iconographic reference	LIMNETICA												Environmental assessments and palaeoreconstructions can take advantage of the high diatom diversity present in mountain lakes. There are only a few studies dealing with the diatom flora of the Pyrenees and research on species taxonomy, distribution and ecology are still at an initial stage. With the aim of updating the list of species present and providing iconographic information for harmonising past and future studies, we report 549 taxa from a survey of 83 lakes across the geographical extent of the Pyrenean lakes comprising a broad range of environmental conditions and in the sedimentary record of the Burg lake. This study is a first step in the development of a comprehensive on-line atlas of Pyrenean diatoms including species occurrence, distribution and ecology (www.diatopyr.com). Samples were collected both from littoral epilithic substrates and the top of the sediment in the deepest zone of the lake. Additionally, we include also taxa that were present in the Late Glacial and Holocene sedimentary records of the Burg palaeolake, which were not found in the survey. The genera including more diversity were Pinnularia, Gomphonema, Eunotia and Nitzschia. About 25% of taxa remain to be determined at fine taxonomic resolution, many of them are likely to be species or varieties not described yet.

Science goals and new mission concepts for future exploration of Titan's atmosphere, geology and habitability: titan POlar scout/orbitEr and in situ lake lander and DrONe explorer (POSEIDON)	EXPERIMENTAL ASTRONOMY												In response to ESA's "Voyage 2050" announcement of opportunity, we propose an ambitious L-class mission to explore one of the most exciting bodies in the Solar System, Saturn's largest moon Titan. Titan, a "world with two oceans", is an organic-rich body with interior-surface-atmosphere interactions that are comparable in complexity to the Earth. Titan is also one of the few places in the Solar System with habitability potential. Titan's remarkable nature was only partly revealed by the Cassini-Huygens mission and still holds mysteries requiring a complete exploration using a variety of vehicles and instruments. The proposed mission concept POSEIDON (Titan POlar Scout/orbitEr and In situ lake lander DrONe explorer) would perform joint orbital and in situ investigations of Titan. It is designed to build on and exceed the scope and scientific/technological accomplishments of Cassini-Huygens, exploring Titan in ways that were not previously possible, in particular through full close-up and in situ coverage over long periods of time. In the proposed mission architecture, POSEIDON consists of two major elements: a spacecraft with a large set of instruments that would orbit Titan, preferably in a low-eccentricity polar orbit, and a suite of in situ investigation components, i.e. a lake lander, a "heavy" drone (possibly amphibious) and/or a fleet of mini-drones, dedicated to the exploration of the polar regions. The ideal arrival time at Titan would be slightly before the next northern Spring equinox (2039), as equinoxes are the most active periods to monitor still largely unknown atmospheric and surface seasonal changes. The exploration of Titan's northern latitudes with an orbiter and in situ element(s) would be highly complementary in terms of timing (with possible mission timing overlap), locations, and science goals with the upcoming NASA New Frontiers Dragonfly mission that will provide in situ exploration of Titan's equatorial regions, in the mid-2030s.

Age, Growth, and Size of Lake Superior Pygmy Whitefish (Prosopium coulterii)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Pygmy Whitefish (Prosopium coulterii) are a small, glacial relict species with a disjunct distribution in North America and Siberia. In 2013 we collected Pygmy Whitefish at 28 stations from throughout Lake Superior. Total length was recorded for all fish and weight and sex were recorded and scales and otoliths were collected from a subsample. We compared the precision of estimated ages between readers and between scales and otoliths, estimated von Bertalanffy growth parameters for male and female Pygmy Whitefish, and reported the first weight-length relationship for Pygmy Whitefish. Age estimates between scales and otoliths differed significantly with otolith ages significantly greater for most ages after age-3. Maximum otolith age was nine for females and seven for males, which is older than previously reported for Pygmy Whitefish from Lake Superior. Growth was initially fast but slowed considerably after age-3 for males and age-4 for females, falling to 3-4 mm per year at maximum estimated ages. Females were longer than males after age-3. Our results suggest the size, age, and growth of Pygmy Whitefish in Lake Superior have not changed appreciably since 1953.

J	Hueftle, SJ; Stevens, LE				Hueftle, SJ; Stevens, LE			Experimental flood effects on the limnology of Lake Powell reservoir, southwestern USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In the spring of 1996, a nine-day test flood from Glen Canyon Dam involved the deepest and largest hypolimnetic withdrawals from the penstocks and the river outlet works (ROW) since 1986, interacting with ongoing hydrodynamic and stratification patterns to enhance freshening of the hypolimnion of Lake Powell reservoir and its tailwaters. Prior to the test flood, a six-year drought had produced a pronounced meromictic hypolimnion that was weakening from high inflow events in 1993 and 1995. Hypoxia, however, had continued to increase in the deepest portions of the reservoir. Over the course of the test flood, 0.893 km(3) were released from the ports located at and below the hypolimnetic chemocline. The increased discharge and mixing resulting from the test flood diminished the volume of this hypoxic and meromictic hypolimnion as far as 100 km uplake. This effect was reinforced by seasonal upwelling of hypolimnetic water at the dam and seasonal hydrologic patterns uplake. The timing and magnitude of the discharge maximized the release of the highest salinity and lowest dissolved oxygen (DO) water that typically occurs near the release structures of the dam annually. Subsequent high inflows and discharges in 1997 continued to freshen the hypolimnion. During the flood, large aerated discharges in the tailwaters briefly increased DO to above saturation but dampened diel fluctuations in pH and DO. Downstream ion concentration levels were elevated during the test flood but resumed an enhanced freshening trend following the lower hydrograph. The results indicate that dam operations, timed with predictable limnological events, can be used to manipulate tailwater and reservoir water quality.																			1051-0761					JUN	2001	11	3					644	656		10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0644:EFEOTL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[0644:EFEOTL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169456900003

SEASONAL PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY PATTERNS AND INFLUENCING FACTORS IN FISH-MUSSEL SYSTEMS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The rapid pearl farming industry causes environmental pollution to aquatic ecosystems. However, fish-mussel systems with highly productive, profitable and environment-friendly characteristics are appropriate aquaculture practices under the current polluted state of the environment in China Phytoplankton are excellent indicators and play indispensable roles in maintaining the stability of a freshwater ecosystem. Therefore, samples were seasonally collected determine the seasonal phytoplankton community dynamics and potential driving factors in three subtropical reservoirs with integrated fish-mussel aquaculture. All water physicochemical parameters varied seasonally, and water quality had a trend of eutrophication. A total of 189 species were identified, among which Chlorophyta (83 species) dominated in species richness. Cyanophyta, in particular remained to be highly abundant (57.53% of the total seasonal biomass). The NMDS analysis indicated that summer was an independent branch. The CCA analysis and Spearman rank correlation analysis suggested that water temperature might be the main abiotic factor. Furthermore, pH, conductivity, DO, chlorophyll, TC and TN also significantly affected the community The aquaculture enhanced the similarity in community structure which have happened due to predation pressure. The present study also identified the potential influences caused by the integrated fish-mussel aquaculture on phytoplankton seasonal succession, bringing some guidance to protect the reservoir ecosystem.

Solms	BOTANY LETTERS												Eichhornia crassipes is notorious as the world's worst aquatic weed, and here we present all aspects of its biology, ecology and invasion behaviour within the framework of the new series of Botany Letters on Monographs on invasive plants in Europe. Native to the Amazon in South America, the plant has been spread around the world since the late 1800s through the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive lilac flowers, and is established on every continent except Antarctica. Its distribution is limited in Europe to the warmer southern regions by cold winter temperatures, but it has extensive ecological and socio-economic impacts where it invades. Its reproductive behaviour, characterised by rapid vegetative spread and high seed production, as well as its wide physiological tolerance, allows it to proliferate rapidly and persist in a wide range of environments. It has recently been regulated by the EU, under Regulation No. 1143/2014, which states that E. crassipes shall not be brought into the territory of the Union, kept, bred or transported to, from or within the Union. However, in the absence of effective control measures, such as herbicidal and biological control, it will continue to be a significant threat to European waterways, particularly in eutrophic waters, and under future climate change scenarios.

Our results show that octocrylene, tonalide, triclocarban, and other personal care products, along with pesticides and biocides can accumulate in ephippia with log BCF values up to 3. Data on the uptake and depuration kinetics show a better fit toward a two compartment organism model over a single compartment model due to the differences in ephippial egg content in the environment. The obtained BCFs correlate with hydrophobicity for neutral. compounds. Independence between BCF and hydrophobicity was observed for partially ionized compounds with log D-ow values around 1. Internal concentrations in ephippia in the environment were predicted based on sediment concentrations using the equilibrium partitioning model and calculated BCFs. Estimated internal concentration values ranged between 1 and 68,000 mu g/kg(lip) with triclocarban having the highest internal concentrations followed by tonalide and triclosan. The outcomes indicate that contaminants can be taken up by ephippia from the water column or the pore water in the sediment and might influence fitness and sexual reproduction in the aquatic key species of the genus Daphnia.

The process of phosphorus removal involves the biochemical conversion from the dissolved to the particulate form (mainly phytoplankton) and the sedimentation of this particulate matter. The input variables are light, orthophosphate concentration, temperature of the inflowing water and discharge. The phytoplankton activity plays the most important role among the various processes. The maximization of orthophosphate elimination depends on adequate design, construction and operation of pre-reservoirs. A simple calculation procedure for the removal rates of orthophosphate-P has been developed. The efficiency of pre-reservoirs is limited, because the light intensity and the temperature during the winter period are low; on the other hand, discharge is often high in March and April (snowmelt). Although pre-reservoirs are an important tool for reservoir water-quality management, but they cannot substitute remedial action in the catchment area. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

J	KROG, GF; HANSEN, L; SONDERGAARD, M				KROG, GF; HANSEN, L; SONDERGAARD, M			DECOMPOSITION OF LAKE PHYTOPLANKTON .2. COMPOSITION AND LABILITY OF LYSIS PRODUCTS	OIKOS												The lysis process of phytoplankton was followed in 24 h incubations in three Danish lakes. By means of gel-chromatography it was shown that the dissolved carbon leaching from different algal groups differed in molecular weight composition. Three distinct molecular weight classes (> 10,000; 700 to 10,000 and < 700 Daltons) leached from blue-green algae in almost equal proportion. The lysis product of spring-bloom diatoms included only the two smaller size classes, and the molecules between 700 and 10,000 Daltons dominated. Measurements of cell content during decomposition of the diatoms revealed polysaccharides and low molecular weight compounds to dominate the lysis products. No proteins were leached during the first 24 h after cell death. By incubating the dead algae in natural lake water, it was possible to detect a high bacterial affinity towards molecules between 700 and 10,000 Daltons, although the other side classes were also utilized. Bacterial transformation of small molecules to larger molecules could be demonstrated.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				FEB	1986	46	1					45	50		10.2307/3565378	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565378													WOS:A1986AZL0800007

Therefore, strict pollution control measures were introduced and the water quality has become meso-eutrophic since the millennium. Due to the touristic significance and change in trophic levels of the lake, numerous ecological studies were carried out, but none of them was focused on both benthic and planktonic microbial communities at the same time. In our study, an attempt was made to reveal the spatial bacterial heterogeneity of the Lake Balaton and Zala River by 16S rDNA terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting and Illumina amplicon sequencing methods in the summer of 2017. According to the molecular biology results, mostly well-known freshwater microorganisms, adapted to nutrient-poor conditions were found in the pelagic water column. The LD12 subclade memberFonsibacter ubiquis, the cyanobacterialSynechococcussp. and unknown Verrucomicrobia species were abundant in the less nutrient-dense basins, while the hgcI clade members showed various distribution. In the estuary and in the nutrient-dense western part of the lake, some eutrophic conditions preferring cyanobacteria (filamentousAnabaenaandAphanizomenonspecies) were also detectable. The benthic microbial community showed higher diversity, according to the observed appearance of microorganisms adapted to the deeper, less aerated layers (e.g. members of Desulfobacteraceae, Nitrosomonadaceae).					; Kaszab, Edit/ITU-0950-2023; Hahn, Judit/AGZ-0185-2022; Toth, Gergo/Q-1133-2019	Toth, Gergo/0000-0002-0302-2681; Kriszt, Balazs/0000-0002-9236-2820; Tancsics, Andras/0000-0002-0927-1136; Szoboszlay, Sandor/0000-0002-0479-6726; Rado, Julia/0000-0003-1093-7094; Ferincz, Arpad/0000-0003-2420-0245; Hahn, Judit/0000-0003-1787-5359; Kaszab, Edit/0000-0002-5917-0464; Farkas, Milan/0000-0002-7807-4750; 													0343-8651	1432-0991				DEC	2020	77	12					4016	4028		10.1007/s00284-020-02241-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-020-02241-7		OCT 2020						33068137					WOS:000579437000001
J	Iguchi, Y				Iguchi, Yutaka			The ecological impact of an introduced population on a native population in the firefly Luciola cruciata (Coleoptera: Lampyridae)	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												In Japan, Tatsuno Town has been famous for many Luciola cruciata fireflies emerging every summer at least since the 1920s. However, in the 1960s, L. cruciata fireflies were intentionally introduced from the Lake Biwa area into Matsuo-kyo, the most famous habitat of fireflies in that town. In this study, I examined ambient temperatures and flash rates of L. cruciata at four sites including Matsuo-kyo in the Tatsuno area and two sites in the Lake Biwa area. The linear regression of flash rates on temperatures indicated that the Matsuo-kyo population was distinct from the other three populations native to the Tatsuno area, but similar to the two populations native to the Lake Biwa area in terms of flash rates. These results were also supported by a recent molecular biological study, suggesting that the introduced fireflies had a strong ecological impact on the native ones at Matsuo-kyo. The present study emphasizes that we should not transport and release L. cruciata fireflies without careful consideration.

The geological uplift of this region created special environments requiring adaptive genetic diversification of the resident lineages. Here, we developed and used the first set of high-resolution microsatellite markers for the Daphnia similis species complex. We screened this species in 23 (out of 303) lakes across China, covering a large geographical and ecological range of habitats. High population clonal diversity of the D. similis species complex was found, regardless of their geographical origin. However, four Tibetan Daphnia sinensis populations showed substantially lower clonal diversity. Interestingly, D. sinensis populations from two regions, Eastern China and the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of Western China, were found to be clearly differentiated from each other. Lakes inhabited by Western D. sinensis were of a lower trophic level, higher altitude, and more likely to freeze in the winter. This study contributes to an understanding of adaptation to their special environments by the freshwater invertebrates in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

Assuming a steady state and ignoring the effects of the Earth's rotation, a simple model was introduced and 25 individual slugs of gravity currents were analyzed. The average drag coefficient, which includes the effects of friction on the slope and the interface between the gravity current and the ambient water, is found to be equal to C-D = (4.6 +/- 1.5) x 10(-3). The volume flux in the gravity current increases with downslope distance-a consequence of both the entrainment of water into the gravity current and the supply of cold water from the plumes. Entrainment was found to be, on average, 1.9 +/- 0.9 times the contribution of vertical plumes, suggesting that the latter may be important in the dynamics of the cascade.

J	Thébault, JM				Thébault, JM			Seasonal evolution of the physico-chemistry and the phytoplankton of Pareloup reservoir over a long period (1983-1998):: impact of total draining	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Lake Pareloup has been studied since 1983. In 1993 it was completely drained, providing an opportunity to study the effect of this disturbance on the ecosystem. This paper gives a synthesis of all data collected since the beginning of the study and describes the physico-chemical variables and phytoplankton population before, and subsequent to, drainage. The results of monitoring over a 16 year period provide a long-term overview of environmental conditions and ecosystem development, compensating for undue disturbance in data from exceptional years. Nitrate concentrations increased slightly in 1986 in the watershed and in the lake, but stabilised in the following years. The observed post-drainage increased concentrations of silica and nitrates in the lake is attributed to increased inflow during three years of exceptional rainfall and not to the drainage itself. Ecosystem function was strongly disturbed in the year following drainage, with the replacement of the dominant phytoplanktonic species by species previously not very abundant. The ecosystem reverted to its original condition from 1995. A reduction in residence time seems to favour the development of centric diatoms (Aulacoseira sp) to the detriment of A. formosa. Considering the role of A. formosa in trapping phosphorus by sedimentation, the dominance of Aulacoseira in some years could disrupt the summer seasonal evolution of the ecosystem.																			0003-4088						2002	38	2					83	99		10.1051/limn/2002014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2002014													WOS:000176613400001

The Moisture Index (MI) is a climate-based indicator currently used in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) to guide the design of wall assemblies for acceptable durability performance. In this study, future changes in MI are calculated across Canada under 2 and 3.5 degrees C of future global warming. Results indicate that the coastal and great lakes regions of Canada will have increased MI, whereas prairies and northern regions will in the future have decreased values of MI. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that drastically different projected future MI changes can be obtained with different values of drying potential normalization factor, and it is suggested that this value is chosen by carefully analyzing the historical and future projected drying potential values. Finally, our analysis shows that wall assemblies at an increased number of reference locations given in the NBCC, importantly those falling in the densely populated south-western Ontario region, will need to be designed with additional safety measures such as a capillary break in the future for them to achieve satisfactory moisture performance over their design lives.

Ice-covered Lake Onega: effects of radiation on convection and internal waves	HYDROBIOLOGIA					4th European Large Lakes Symposium (ELLS)	AUG 24-28, 2015	Univ Eastern Finland, Joensuu, FINLAND		Univ Eastern Finland			Early-spring under-ice convection in the Petrozavodsk Bay of Lake Onega (Russia) was investigated as part of an interdisciplinary research project conducted during March 2015. Measurements performed using a thermistor chain and vertical profiling sensors were used to examine temperature dynamics in the convectively mixed and stratified layers of the lake. Radiative transfer through the ice was high leading to a large convective mixed layer (up to 20 m deep) during daytime. Convective velocity was evaluated using two different methods. It is shown that convective velocity (a maximum value of similar to 7.4 mm s(-1), and daytime average of 3.9 mm s(-1)) is completely damped during the restratifying night hours. We observed internal waves in the thermocline below the convective mixed layer with intriguing variations between night and day. Maximum of internal wave energy was found to start in the afternoon and continue long after the end of solar radiation forcing. Our analysis indicates that local convective processes are key forcing mechanisms for the generation of internal waves in ice-covered lakes. We also hypothesize that spatial differential heating between the nearshore regions and the centre of the bay (e.g. density current intruding the thermocline) could be a source of internal waves in ice-covered lakes.					; Zdorovennov, Roman/L-8294-2013; Wuest, Alfred/L-2607-2014; Zdorovennova, Galina/L-8214-2013; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013	Tofield Pasche, Natacha/0000-0002-9578-9301; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Zdorovennov, Roman/0000-0003-1695-4872; Zdorovennova, Galina/0000-0003-2726-0104; Terzhevik, Arkady/0000-0002-0837-9065													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2016	780	1					21	36		10.1007/s10750-016-2915-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2915-3													WOS:000383130200003
J	An, Q; Wang, H; Wang, XN				An, Qi; Wang, Hao; Wang, Xiunan			Fish survival subject to algal bloom: Resource-based growth models with algal digestion delay and detritus-nutrient recycling delay	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In this paper, we propose a class of resource -based growth models with delays in algal digestion and detritusnutrient recycling, and investigate the model based on two different survival scenarios of algae during nutrient transformation. One scenario considers the survival rates of algae during nutrient uptake, while the other overlooks this factor. We find a significant difference in the estimated time window required for clearing the lake of detritus between the two models, and both are longer compared to the model without algal digestion delay. Moreover, the internal equilibria of both scenarios undergo an infinite number of stability switches, however, the key parameters leading to these stability switches differ. Notably, in the model accounting for algal death during nutrient uptake, there exists a safe zone where the stability of the internal equilibrium remains unaffected by the detritus -nutrient recycling delay, provided that the algal digestion delay falls within a suitable range. The findings derived from this study can provide valuable insights for the development of efficacious approaches in safeguarding the ecological integrity, managing algal blooms, facilitating sustainable fishery practices, and fostering favorable economic outcomes within the realm of water resources advancement.					; QI, AN/KVY-9401-2024	WANG, HAO/0000-0002-4132-6109; Wang, Xiunan/0000-0003-4070-4101													0304-3800	1872-7026				MAY	2024	491								110672	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2024.110672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2024.110672		MAR 2024											WOS:001209182600001

Ten GPS sites are located within a radius of 30 km around Vostok Station on floating ice as well as on grounded ice to the east and to the west of the lake. Additionally, a local deformation network around the ice core drilling site 5G-1 was installed. The derived ice flow velocity for Vostok Station 2.00 m a(-1) +/- 0.01 m a(-1). Along the flowline of Vostok Station an extension rate of about 10(-5) a(-1) (equivalent to 1 cm km(-1) a(-1)) was determined. This significant velocity gradient results in a new estimate of 28 700 years for the transit time of an ice particle along the Vostok flowline from the bedrock ridge in the southwest of the lake to the eastern shoreline. With these lower velocities compared to earlier studies and, hence, larger transit times the basal accretion rate is estimated to be 4 mm a(-1) along a portion of the Vostok flowline. An assessment of the local accretion rate at Vostok Station using the observed geodetic quantities yields an accretion rate in the same order of magnitude. Furthermore, the comparison of our geodetic observations with results inferred from ice-penetrating radar data indicates that the ice flow may not have changed significantly for several thousand years.

To stimulate algal growth, the microcosms were fertilized with two P-rich wood ashes, and KNO3. Chlorophyll-a was used as an indicator of algal growth while filtered (<0.2 mu m) and particulate suspended element concentrations (>0.2 mu m) were used to estimate algal metal uptake. Water quality measurements and water sampling were conducted on three occasions (every five days) and at the start of the experiment to monitor algal growth. The chlorophyll-a concentration in the microcosms fertilized with wood ash increased from 0.3-0.8 mu g/L at the start of the experiment to 53-77 mu g/L after 15 days. Algal element uptake of filtered concentrations (<0.2 mu m) was observed for many elements including, Ni (33-36%), Zn (22-65%) and Cd (22-54%). This suggests that wood ash could be used to stimulate algal growth in pit lakes by acting as a source for P and potentially also other nutrients. The highest chlorophyll-a concentrations were seen on day 10, indicating that a breakdown of chlorophyll-a impacted the measured concentrations, which otherwise could have been higher.

J	Zhu, YW; Wang, HX; Guo, WX				Zhu, Yongwei; Wang, Hongxiang; Guo, Wenxian			The impacts of water level fluctuations of East Dongting Lake on habitat suitability of migratory birds	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Understanding responses of habitat suitability of migratory birds to the water level is significant for providing countermeasures of wetland protection. East Dongting Lake serves critical wintering habitat for migratory birds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. However, the response relationships between the water level and the weighted usable area (WUA) for migratory birds remain largely unknown. Therefore, we established a habitat suitability model of migratory birds based on the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and recognized the change of WUA by comparing the transition of land-cover of similar hydrologic years before and after the operation of Three Gorge Dam (TGD). The results demonstrated that (1) the ecological water level of migratory birds in East Dongting Lake is 20.47-21.55 m. (2) Compared with the preTGD period, the start date of the ecological water level advanced by 25 days, the duration of the ecological water level increased by 16 days, and the fluctuation range of water level was more concentrated near the ecological water level, indicating that the TGD provides benefits for the migratory birds. (3) The most prominent transition among changes of land-cover was that the Reed beach (RB) (155.07 km(2)) and Marsh land (ML) (150.66 km(2)) changed to Tender Marsh land (TML) during dry hydrologic years, and the RB (171.90 km(2)) and ML (174.30 km(2)) changed to TML during normal hydrologic years. The findings show that water level changes habitat suitability of migratory birds by changing vegetation distribution at different elevations.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2021	132								108277	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108277		OCT 2021											WOS:000710490700003

J	Li, YH; Zhao, ML; Li, FD				Li, Yanhong; Zhao, Mingliang; Li, Fadong			Soil respiration in typical plant communities in the wetland surrounding the high-salinity Ebinur Lake	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE												Soil respiration in wetlands surrounding lakes is a vital component of the soil carbon cycle in arid regions. However, information remains limited on the soil respiration around highly saline lakes during the plant growing season. Here, we aimed to evaluate diurnal and seasonal variation in soil respiration to elucidate the controlling factors in the wetland of Ebinur Lake, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, western China. We used a soil carbon flux automatic analyzer (LI-840A) to measure soil respiration rates during the growing season (April to November) in two fields covered by reeds and tamarisk and one field with no vegetation (bare soil) from 2015 to 2016. The results showed a single peak in the diurnal pattern of soil respiration from 11:00 to 17:00 for plots covered in reeds, tamarisk, and bare soil, with minimum values being detected from 03:00 to 07:00. During the growing season, the soil respiration of reeds and tamarisk peaked during the thriving period (4.16 and 3.75 molm(-2)s(-1), respectively), while that of bare soil peaked during the intermediate growth period (0.74 molm(-2)s(-1)). The soil respiration in all three plots was lowest during the wintering period (0.08, 0.09, and-0.87 molm(-2)s(-1), respectively). Air temperature and relative humidity significantly influenced soil respiration. A significant linear relationship was detected between soil respiration and soil temperature for reeds, tamarisk, and bare soil. The average Q(10) of reeds and tamarisk were larger than that of bare soil. However, soil moisture content was not the main factor controlling soil respiration. Soil respiration was negatively correlated with soil pH and soil salinity in all three plot types. In contrast, soil respiration was positively correlated with organic carbon. Overall, CO2 emissions and greenhouse gases had a relatively weak effect on the wetlands surrounding the highly saline Ebinur Lake.					zhao, mingliang/KLZ-5653-2024														2095-0195	2095-0209				SEP	2018	12	3					611	624		10.1007/s11707-018-0687-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-018-0687-y													WOS:000444389400013

In this study, samples of muscle and eggs collected from female Chinook salmon entering the Credit River contained total PCBs. DDT compounds and other organochlorine (OC) compounds at mu g kg concentrations, Semi-permeable membrane devices (SPMDs) were deployed at a reference site above the spawning grounds and at two downstream sites at intervals over a 14-month period that spanned two spawning runs. There was an increase in the concentrations of total PCBs, total DDT and other classes of OCs in the SPMDs deployed at the two downstream sites during and after both spawning runs indicating that the decay of salmon releases contaminants into the river. Based upon the concentration,, of contaminants in the salmon tissues, approximately 75 g of total PCBs and 35 g of total DDT compounds would be transported annually into the Credit River from this source.

The Rhipicephalus appendiculatus tick vector of Theileria parva is absent from cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) populations and associated ecosystems in northern Uganda	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												Rhipicephalus appendiculatus is the major tick vector of Theileria parva, an apicomplexan protozoan parasite that causes the most economically important and lethal disease of cattle in East and central Africa. The African cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is the major wildlife host of T. parva from southern Uganda and Kenya to southern Africa. We show herein that R. appendiculatus appears to be absent from the two largest national parks in northern Uganda. Syncerus caffer is common in both of these national parks, specifically Murchison falls (MFNP) and Kidepo Valley (KVNP). We re-confirmed the previously reported absence of T. parva in buffalo sampled in the two northern parks based on RLB data using a nested PCR based on the T. parva p104 gene. By contrast, T. parva-infected R. appendiculatus ticks and parasite-infected buffalo were present in Lake Mburo (LMNP) in South central Uganda. This suggests that the distribution of R. appendiculatus, which is predicted to include the higher rainfall regions of northern Uganda, may be limited by additional, as yet unknown factors.

J	McKinnell, S				McKinnell, Skip			Modelling salmon migration as a mixture problem	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Pulses of abundance in salmon migrations can arise from single populations arriving at different times, from multiple populations with different timing characteristics, or as a combination of these. Daily observations typically record an aggregate measure of abundance passing some location rather than the abundances of the individual components. An objective method is described that partitions a compound migration into its component parts by exploiting differences in the characteristics of each pulse. Simulated data were used to demonstrate when greater model complexity may be desirable. Three case studies of increasing complexity (Chilko Lake sockeye salmon smolts (Oncorhynchus nerka), large adult Columbia River Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Fraser River salmon test fishery) demonstrate how the model can be applied in practice. Results indicated that Chilko Lake smolts rarely emigrate to sea as a single pulse, that the dates used to distinguish the spring run of Chinook salmon in the Columbia River may be overestimating its abundance, and that pulses of sockeye salmon abundance in a Fraser River ocean test fishery in 2014 may have arisen from some factor other than population composition.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2019	76	6					856	870		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0546	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0546													WOS:000469204200002

Colonization of leaves by algal and bacterial epiphytes, as seen by scanning electron microscopy, followed the established pattern of increasing diversity and density with leaf age. Micrographs indicated that the primary and subsequent colonizers were present even after host leaf death. Cross sections of leaves, viewed by transmission electron microscopy, illustrated that bacterial attachment did not damage the surface of young leaves. There was, however, extensive inward swelling and disorganization of the epidermal walls, characteristic of a reaction to invasion by pathogens. In older leaves the swelling was also present in mesophyll cells, while bacteria had invaded and degraded the epidermal cell wall. The bacterial invasion was concomitant with signs of senescence, and in dead leaves the organisms had penetrated and degraded the epidermis and mesophyll cell walls. The epiphyton/host relationship may therefore be considered necrotrophic with important consequences for the transfer of energy from producers to consumers during decomposition.																			0095-3628	1432-184X					1981	7	4					351	363		10.1007/BF02341430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02341430								24227551					WOS:A1981NE18100008

However, surface warming reduces the range of vertical mixing and the probability of full circulation events. Important consequences of reduced vertical mixing include the sequestration of phosphorus (P) within a stagnant zone and the promotion of oligotrophication. Nevertheless, warming-induced shifts from full to partial mixing (meromixis) are not permanent and are partially reversible during exceptionally cold or windy winters. In this study, we investigated how intermittent meromixis affects lake P budgets. We examined the P cycle of a perialpine lake with variable mixing depths by pairing sedimentation and release flux measurements with sedimentary archives. We found that the amount of dissolved P surpassed that of the potentially mobile P in the sediments by a 13:1 ratio. At least 55% of the settled P was rapidly released to bottom waters isolated from flushing, illustrating the general biogeochemical mechanism that promotes deep-water P storage when lakes undergo warming. This storage process is abruptly inverted when meromixis suddenly retreats, deeper mixing introduces P pulses to the surface waters, thereby promoting phytoplankton proliferation. Our estimates showed that lakes containing up to 40% of the global freshwater volume could shift towards intermittent meromixis if the atmospheric warming trend continues. Thus, these lakes might accumulate 0-83% of their P load in irregularly circulating waters and are prone to large P pulses.

J	Sarmiento, ZF; Sagala, B; Siagian, H				Sarmiento, Zosimo F.; Sagala, Birean; Siagian, Haris			The Sokoria Geothermal System, Flores Island, Indonesia	GEOTHERMICS												The Sokoria geothermal field is a typical volcano-hosted geothermal system with widely distributed thermal features including altered ground, fumaroles and bicarbonate-sulfate-chloride springs. The main resource is situated beneath the flanks of the Kelimutu Volcanic Complex on Flores Island, Indonesia. This complex is renowned for its three acidic crater lakes that change color from time to time. Recent exploration and drilling results at Sokoria indicate the existence of a medium to high enthalpy resource, in the range of 200-260 degrees C, with slightly acidic fluids (pH 4.2 - 5.7) that have been sampled during flow testing of three wells without any physical evidence of corrosion of the surface facilities or the wellhead. Stable isotope data from these waters lie on or near the world meteoric line implying that the resource fluids as well as those from the different thermal waters are of meteoric origin typical of many geothermal systems. Initial testing results show that the first 5 MWe in the area can be commissioned by the end of 2019. This field could be developed to generate up to 30 MWe.

PASSERINES USE NOCTURNAL FLIGHTS FOR LANDSCAPE-SCALE MOVEMENTS DURING MIGRATION STOPOVER	CONDOR												Knowledge of stopovers made by migratory birds comes mostly from studies at relatively fine spatial scales. While this focus yields important information about processes at those scales, it ignores possible processes acting at broader spatial scales. We established an array of three automated radio-telemetry receiver towers housing ten antennas arranged to sample a landscape and its associated airspace at Lake Erie in southern Canada. We used digitally coded tags to monitor the behavior of multiple Swainson's and Hermit Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus and C. guttatus) simultaneously during fall 2008. The towers registered flight activity of 86% of the 69 radio-tagged individuals, whose flights occurred predominantly shortly after the end of evening civil twilight. We recorded 15 nocturnal flights that were not departure flights, indicating that during stopover passerines make nocturnal flights for purposes other than the continuation of migration. The flights we recorded were distributed throughout the night, and in eight cases they resulted in individuals moving many kilometers. These multiple instances of nocturnal landscape-scale movements represent an ecological process that is not detectable when the focus of sampling is too small. We suggest that in most studies of passerines' stopover ecology, researchers need to consider temporal and spatial scales more carefully.																			0010-5422					AUG	2011	113	3					597	607		10.1525/cond.2011.100186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cond.2011.100186													WOS:000294796500015

Body mass-related shift in movement behaviour in the isopod Lekanesphaera hookeri (Isopoda, Flabellifera): A laboratory study	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												A quantitative study of the movement behaviour of the brackish isopod Lekanesphaera hookeri was performed. Isopods were collected in late spring 2007 from an Italian lagoon and held in the laboratory under temperature-controlled conditions. We used a real-time video acquisition system to measure in resource-free arenas the mean step length, total path length, average movement speed and movement complexity of individuals characterised by a 10-fold difference in body mass. The fractal dimension D was used as a tortuosity index to estimate the complexity of the movement trajectory. No significant size-related patterns were observed for the mean step length, total path length and average movement speed of the sphaeromatids. Conversely, fractal D values varied negatively with the body mass of specimens according to a power law. Our findings indicate that L. hookeri is characterised by a size-related shift in movement behaviour, occurring independently from the availability of resources in the surrounding environment. The implications of size-related changes in movement complexity are discussed in the context of current metabolic theories.

Nowadays it is used as an unfertilised fishpond. In order to estimate the human impacts we have monitored changes in macrophyte community for 5 years and changes in water chemistry during two vegetation periods. The values of chemical parameters indicated the input of nutrients and different ions entering the system through the run-off from the surrounding areas and by the tributary. At low water level during summer period, oxygen was lacking in the whole water column. The bottom and the water column of the lake were completely colonised by macrophytes comprising 17 species of different growth forms, among which Trapa natans and Ceratophyllum demersum prevailed. The Komarnik accumulation lake revealed to be a resilient system, since inter-annual changes of water level affected only species abundance and not species composition.																					978-1-4020-8234-4				2008							13	+		10.1007/978-1-4020-8235-1_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-8235-1_2													WOS:000259993900002
J	Das, L; Meher, JK				Das, Lalu; Meher, Jitendra Kumar			Drivers of climate over the Western Himalayan region of India: A review	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Himalayas popularly known as the 'Third Pole' and 'Water tower' of Asia has attracted global attention under the context of climate change as rainfall in this region has decreased drastically, and temperature has risen very rapidly in the last century. Present study was attempted to quantify such abnormal warming and unexpected declining trend of rainfall vis-a-vis to identify factors influencing such abnormal behavior over the complex physiographical region technically known as Western Himalaya Region (WHR) through the available literature therein. It was revealed that frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall and temperature events have risen due to the variation of local weather events while mean climate has altered due to the influence of large-scale circulations like the Indian monsoon, Western Disturbances, and change in teleconnection pattern. Why the WHR has been a hotspot of several hazards like the cloudburst, Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF), convective storms, and forest fires in the past have been answered with appropriate evidence. Feedback from different atmospheric factors like snow-albedo, black carbon, and other suspended particulates was discussed in details to understand the complex nature of the Himalayan climate. WHR may face higher magnitude of heavy and extreme rainfall because of its accelerated warming. Information assembled in the present paper will be considered as a valuable resource document for the remote and vulnerable geographical locations of WHR, where research and developmental activities lag due to unavailability of adequate data and its quality and insufficient information and its proper access in a concise form.

Cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption) acquired in Germany	DEUTSCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT												History and findings: Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a zoonotic hookworm infection. Since survival and mobility of the worm larvae depend on external temperature, CLM is most frequently acquired in subtropical or tropical areas. Two women, aged 39 and 60 years, respectively, presented themselves in the outpatient department with pruriginous skin lesions, first noted several days before. Neither had been abroad, but both had been walking around a dredged lake in North Rhine-West-phalia some days before. The characteristic serpiginous skin lesions were identified as larva migrans cutanea ("creeping eruption"; sandworm). It is caused by the larvae of a zoonotic hookworm infection. Treatment and course: The lesions regressed after a single dose of ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg body weight. Conclusion: CLM occurs most frequently in warm regions. It may sometimes also occur autochtchoneusly in Germany, especially in sandy soil, during the summer months. This must be taken into account when patients with pruriginous skin lesions are seen. Therapy with ivermectin is efficacious and safe.																			0012-0472					APR	2010	135	17					859	861		10.1055/s-0030-1253669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1253669								20408105					WOS:000276859700004

One set of eight enclosures was located in the deep part of the lake (12 m) where water thermally stratifies during the summer. The other set of eight enclosures was located in a shallow area of the lake (3.5 m) where the water does not thermally stratify. During the summer months, phyytoplankton cell number and biomass increased significantly with both nutrient additions (P = 0.004) and the presence of planktivorous fish (P = 0.011) in the deep, thermally stratified enclosures. On average, total algal biomass in the nutrient and fish treatments was 2.6 times higher than in the nutrient-only treatments. In contrast, in the shallow enclosures, total phytoplankton biomass increased with nutrient additions (P = 0.04) but was not significantly affected by the addition of fish (P = 0.34). However fish additions increased the number of algal cells in both the shallow and deep enclosures, independently of nutrients, because of an increase in small cells: the proportion of nanoplankton cells was significantly greater in the presence of fish. Fertilization increased the large nanoplankton fraction (10-20 mu m) in the deep enclosures, but had no significant effect on the size distribution of algal biomass in the shallow enclosures. In general, large (>64 mu m) cells were a minor component of the phytoplankton biomass in ail treatments. Fertilization stimulated the growth of Chlorophyta in the deep (P = 0.018) and in the shallow (P = 0.012) enclosures, Cyanobacteria were conspicuous in the fertilized shallow enclosures, but the effect on total biomass was not statistically significant. The presence of fish stimulated a significant increase in Cryptophyta at both depths and Pyrrophyta were more common. Nutrients and planktivorous fish had different effects on phytoplankton depending on the thermal regime. In terms of total algal biomass there was no significant difference between deep and shallow enclosures within a given treatment, but depth did affect the size distribution of algal biomass among treatments. The effects of fish were more evident with community structure variables (size or taxonomic distribution) than with coarser variables such as algal biomass.

The secchi disc transparency was 18 m in July 1984, decreased to 0.3 m in July 1985, and increased to 13 m in July 1986 after a rise in the water level. The abiotic changes induced major effects in the zooplankton community, with a strong reduction in occurrence of Cladocera (Holopedium gibberum and Bosmina longispina). The allopatric population of brown trout, Salmo trutta, which mainly fed on zooplankton before the siltation, fed predominantly on surface insects during the summer of high siltation. The food consumption was lower than in the pre- and post-siltation years, resulting in reduced k-values, reduced number of spawners, and increased mortality of mature fish.																			0378-1909					JUL	1992	34	3					247	255		10.1007/BF00004770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004770													WOS:A1992JE17600003

Grand challenges for research in the Laurentian Great Lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Laurentian Great Lakes (LGL) constitute one of the largest freshwater systems in the world while providing social and economic value to two powerful nations. The spatial scale of these inland seas falls between two endpoints: small lakes and oceans. Lacustrine in many characteristics, the LGL often require a scientific approach with attributes similar to those of oceanography. There is a strong sense that within the LGL support for scientific research has not kept pace with the need for process-oriented research and that we lack basic information needed to forecast change, mitigate impacts and restore and preserve the LGL. Consequently, 58 researchers met in September 2014 and identified five Grand Challenges for Research in the LGL: (1) How has this vast inland freshwater system responded to shifting climate in the past, and how will it respond in the future? (2) What is the current status of the most important ecosystem processes, including their variability in space and time? (3) What processes are characteristic only of large lakes, and how do the distinct habitats integrate into a whole? (4) What are the ecosystem responses to major anthropogenic forces such as nutrients and invasive species, and are these reversible? and (5) What are the small to large-scale linkages and feedbacks among societal decisions, biological systems, and physicochemical dynamics? An urgent need exists for a unified scientific voice that articulates the Grand Challenges for research in the LGL and the need for associated funding.

Supraglacial lakes, which form on the ice sheet surface during the summer months, can impact ice sheet dynamics and mass loss; thus, better understanding these lakes' seasonal evolution and dynamics is an important task. This study presents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to identify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that refreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt season, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few meters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible radiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model, trained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy with Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. This performance significantly surpasses existing machine learning and deep learning models which require a large training data. The results demonstrate the robustness of the RPS-GMM model in capturing the complex temporal dynamics of supraglacial lakes with minimal training data.																			1946-0740	1946-0759	979-8-3503-7489-6; 979-8-3503-7488-9				2024							490	497		10.1109/ICMLA61862.2024.00072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA61862.2024.00072													WOS:001468515500066

The generation sequence is: calcite, dolomite, ferrous calcite, ankerite, and the latest are coarse-grained and fine-grained calcites which are veined. In the MnO-FeO-MgO triangular diagram, the samples fall clearly on the four areas. The carbon and oxygen isotope data on the carbonate cements show that delta C-13 are from-6.44 to +4.79, delta O-18 are from - 4.25 to -15.21, focused on three areas in the map. The paleosalinity Z from 107 to 133 calculated by the carbon and oxygen isotope value reflects the characteristics that salinity changes are caused by fresh water filling lake water. The average temperature of calcite precipitation calculated by the oxygen isotope value is 650 degrees C, while dolomite precipitation is 70.6 degrees C. The precipitation temperature changes greatly and shows negative correlation with temperature and salinity, which reflects the characteristics of lake sediments.

The bacterial 16S rRNA genes were cloned from each site, screened for beta-proteobacterial clones and sequenced. River biofilm clones from both rivers grouped into 9 clusters (RBFs). RBFs 1, 2, and 3 fell into the recently described betaI cluster of cosmopolitan freshwater bacteria, where they represented new species related to Rhodoferax, Aquaspirillum, and Hydrogenophaga. RBFs 4 to 7 affiliated with Aquabacterium commune, Ideonella dechloratans, and Sphaerotilus natans, respectively. The two remaining RBFs were uncultivated clusters, one of them being distantly related to Gallionella ferruginea. Seasonal changes in the relative intensity of the beta-proteobacterial 16S rRNA genes of biofilms harvested monthly for 1 year were determined by specific amplification and separation by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). Bands were identified by comparison of clones to community fingerprints by TGGE. Eight of 13 identified bands were shared by both habitats but showed different relative abundance and seasonal variability in the two rivers, probably caused by differences in temperature and pollutants. The data indicate new not-yet-cultivated clusters of river biofilm organisms, some of them probably distributed globally. They confirm the importance of certain known freshwater genera in river biofilms. The high phylogenetic resolution obtained by clone library analysis combined with the high temporal resolution obtained by TGGE suggest that the observed microdiversity in the river biofilm clone libraries might be caused by phylogenetically closely related microbial populations which are adapted to ecological parameters.					; Wagner-Döbler, Irene/Y-1685-2019	Wagner-Dobler, Irene/0000-0001-5883-2502; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				AUG	2003	69	8					4463	4473		10.1128/AEM.69.8.4463-4473.2003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.8.4463-4473.2003								12902230					WOS:000184672500017
J	Wagner, C; Adrian, R				Wagner, Carola; Adrian, Rita			Cyanobacteria dominance: Quantifying the effects of climate change	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An increase in cyanobacteria bloom formation within lakes has been forecasted as a result of global warming. We investigated the particular physical and chemical thresholds for cyanobacteria performance in a lake model system, the polymictic eutrophic Muggelsee, which has been affected by significant warming trends and substantial reductions in external nutrient load. To identify key physical and nutrient thresholds favoring cyanobacterial performance, we applied classification tree analysis to water temperature, Schmidt stability, oxygen, pH, nutrients (including phosphorus, nitrogen, and their relative ratios), and zooplankton abundance during periods of summer thermal stratification. Although total phosphorus (TP) concentration was the principal force driving cyanobacteria contribution to total algal mass, climate-induced changes in the thermal regime, rather than direct temperature effects, positively influenced cyanobacteria dominance. Stratification periods exceeding 3 weeks and exhibiting a Schmidt stability of >44 g cm cm(-2) favored cyanobacteria proliferation within a critical TP concentration range (70-215 mu g L-1). The dominating genera Aphanizomenon, Anabaena, and Microcystis achieved the highest biomass in cases in which total nitrogen concentrations exceeded 1.29 mg L-1, stratified conditions exceeded a duration of 3 weeks, and TP concentrations exceeded 215 mu g L-1, respectively. Given the observed broad range of TP thresholds within which climate warming enhances the probability of cyanobacteria dominance, the incidence of cyanobacteria blooms will certainly increase in many lakes under future climate scenarios.

Reproduction strategies of Daphnia pulicaria population in a high mountain lake of Southern Spain	HYDROBIOLOGIA					7th International Symposium on Cladocera	SEP 03-09, 2005	Herzberg, SWITZERLAND					For three consecutive years, a population study of Daphnia pulicaria was undertaken in Rio Seco Lake, a small high-mountain lake, in order to elucidate the reproductive strategies adopted by Daphnia in this system. Daphnia appears to colonize this lake every spring by hatching from ephippia and reproduce by means of subitaneous (non-diapausing) and ephippial (diapausing) eggs. D. pulicaria in this lake is an obligate parthenogenetic population. There is a short time period for subitaneous egg production and a much longer period for ephippial egg production. The contribution of subitaneous eggs to Daphnia population density and structure appears to be low. Diapause onset showed a high temporal synchronization in the three studied years in Rio Seco Lake, and day-length emerged as the main cue triggering diapause onset and the main explanatory factor for the proportion of ephippial females observed. The development and reproduction of D. pulicaria in Rio Seco Lake involves taking a gamble on resting forms to guarantee inter-annual Daphnia persistence in the lake, giving priority to investment in future generations.

Using orbital data, we mapped the crater infillings and measured their geometry to determine their origin. The sediment of Aeolis Mons is interpreted to be primarily air fall material such as dust, volcanic ash, fine-grained impact products, and possibly snow deposited by settling from the atmosphere, as well as wind-blown sands cemented in the crater center. Unconformity surfaces between the geological units are evidence for depositional hiatuses. Crater floor material deposited around Aeolis Mons and on the crater wall is interpreted to be alluvial and colluvial deposits. Morphologic evidence suggests that a shallow lake existed after the formation of the lowermost part of Aeolis Mons (the Small yardangs unit and the mass-wasting deposits). A suite of several features including patterned ground and possible rock glaciers are suggestive of periglacial processes with a permafrost environment after the first hundreds of thousands of years following its formation, dated to similar to 3.61 Ga, in the Late Noachian/Early Hesperian. Episodic melting of snow in the crater could have caused the formation of sulfates and clays in Aeolis Mons, the formation of rock glaciers and the incision of deep canyons and valleys along its flanks as well as on the crater wall and rim, and the formation of a lake in the deepest portions of Gale.					; Rossi, Angelo Pio/B-5931-2013; Hauber, Ernst/U-2521-2018; Le Deit, Laetitia/M-7883-2018; Jaumann, Ralf/N-1001-2018; Pondrelli, Monica/GWU-7565-2022	Rossi, Angelo Pio/0000-0002-0137-1984; Hauber, Ernst/0000-0002-1375-304X; Pondrelli, Monica/0000-0002-2103-2939; 													2169-9097	2169-9100				DEC	2013	118	12					2439	2473		10.1002/2012JE004322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2012JE004322													WOS:000329735600001

Here, we identify magnetofossils in core XB1 from the northwestern South China Sea (SCS) since end of the Last Glacial. Using rock magnetic and electron microscopic data, we propose a model that links the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility fabric and the abundance of magnetofossils. The magnetofossil concentration in sediments increases significantly during the 14.7-4.7 ka period, which in turns leads to inverse magnetic fabrics and near-horizontal of the minimum magnetic susceptibility axes. Further, we show that the abundance of magnetofossils is linked to paleoenvironmental changes in the northwestern SCS. The production and preservation of magnetofossils during the 14.7-4.7 ka period are promoted by an intensified East Asian summer monsoon and sluggish deep-water ventilation, while the paucity of magnetofossils after 4.7 ka is attributed to high oxygen content.					; Zheng, Yanan/GPX-8908-2022; Zhong, Yi/R-3249-2016; Ferré, Eric/AFA-0442-2022	He, Kuang/0000-0002-5129-7540; Ferre, Eric/0000-0002-3741-6371; Zhong, Yi/0000-0002-4298-8737; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUL 28	2022	49	14							e2022GL098507	10.1029/2022GL098507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098507													WOS:000834815500001

In the mid-2010s, summer cyanobacterial blooms of Microcystis sp. occurred regularly in Lake Balaton. During this period, we investigated how the alimentary tract of filter-feeding bigheaded carps could deliver different chemotypes of viable cyanobacteria with specific peptide patterns. Twenty-five Microcystis strains were isolated from pelagic plankton samples (14 samples) and the hindguts of bigheaded carp (11 samples), and three bloom samples were collected from the scums of cyanobacterial blooms. An LC-MS/MS-based untargeted approach was used to analyze peptide patterns, which identified 36 anabaenopeptin, 17 microginin, and 13 microcystin variants. Heat map clustering visualization was used to compare the identified chemotypes. A lack of separation was observed in peptide patterns of Microcystis that originated from hindguts, water samples, and bloom-samples. Except for 13 peptides, all other congeners were detected from the viable and cultivated chemotypes of bigheaded carp. This finding suggests that the alimentary tract of bigheaded carps is not simply an extreme habitat, but may also supply the cyanobacterial strains that represent the pelagic chemotypes.					; Vitál, Zoltán/GXF-7227-2022; Nagy-László PhD, Zsolt/ABF-1526-2021; Gonda, Sándor/AAD-4270-2019; Borsodi, Andrea/H-1148-2017	Gonda, Sandor/0000-0001-9776-0249; Kiss, Attila/0000-0003-3601-5143; Riba, Milan/0009-0004-5366-0456; Borsodi, Andrea/0000-0002-3738-7937														2072-6651				MAY	2019	11	5							288	10.3390/toxins11050288	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins11050288								31121822					WOS:000472672300051

Glacial lake outburst flood risk in Himachal Pradesh, India: an integrative and anticipatory approach considering current and future threats	NATURAL HAZARDS												Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a serious and potentially increasing threat to livelihoods and infrastructure in most high-mountain regions of the world. Here, we integrate modelling approaches that capture both current and future potential for GLOF triggering, quantification of affected downstream areas, and assessment of the underlying societal vulnerability to such climate-related disasters, to implement a first-order assessment of GLOF risk across the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh (HP), Northern India. The assessment thereby considers both current glacial lakes and modelled future lakes that are expected to form as glaciers retreat. Current hazard, vulnerability, and exposure indices are combined to reveal several risk 'hotspots', illustrating that significant GLOF risk may in some instances occur far downstream from the glaciated headwaters where the threats originate. In particular, trans-national GLOFs originating in the upper Satluj River Basin (China) are a threat to downstream areas of eastern HP. For the future deglaciated scenario, a significant increase in GLOF hazard levels is projected across most administrative units, as lakes expand or form closer towards steep headwalls from which impacts of falling ice and rock may trigger outburst events. For example, in the central area of Kullu, a 7-fold increase in the probability of GLOF triggering and a 3-fold increase in the downstream area affected by potential GLOF paths can be anticipated, leading to an overall increase in the assigned GLOF hazard level from 'high' to 'very high'. In such instances, strengthening resilience and capacities to reduce the current GLOF risk will provide an important first step towards adapting to future challenges.

Using laboratory bioassays, we studied how planktonic bacteria may modify kairomone activity. We measured the amplitude of diel vertical migration (DVM) of Daphnia pulex DE GEER among treatments with different amounts of bacteria. We used temperature incubation to increase bacterial densities and filtration to reduce abundance. Daphnids exposed to fish cue (F) and filtrate of fish cue (FF) (i. e. 3.0 fold decrease in the planktonic bacteria) exhibited a strong DVM response. In addition, the strength of the response remained the same for both treatments. However, daphnids exposed to an incubated fish cue (IF), which had higher bacterial densities, showed similar migration to daphnids in the control treatment. This IF treatment showed a 3-fold enrichment of bacteria. Besides observing a gradient in DVM response with bacterial density, we also found that DVM response varied seasonally in our experiments. DVM response to fish cue developed quickly in the experiments carried out in March and May compared to a delayed response that we observed in a similar experiment in January. A seasonal shift also occurred in the population sizes of cultivable planktonic bacteria. Responsiveness of D. pulex to predator cues may vary seasonally, possibly due to higher vulnerability during seasons with high fish production. Kairomone concentrations may also fluctuate due to varied release or degradation rates. Our results suggest that the in-situ, tight coupling between production and degradation of kairomone appears to be the cause of DVM response for daphnids during summer.					beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; Gozen, Ayse/AAC-3952-2019	Gozen, Ayse Gul/0000-0001-5479-051X													0003-9136					JAN	2006	165	1					89	104		10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0089													WOS:000235113100006

Diatoms were taken mostly from Phragmites australis stems in 2017, during which physical and chemical parameters of the water were measured. A total of 85 diatom taxa were identified. Gomphonema (13 spp.), Navicula (11 spp.), and Nitzschia (8 spp.) were the most abundant genera. Obtained values of trophic indices (TID, TvD, and TDIL) pointed to meso- to eutrophic status for most localities, while values of the IBD, EPI, -D, and IPS indices indicated good ecological status, except for localities at the mouth of 2 main tributaries which had moderate or poor ecological status. Based on the hierarchical group average clustering and nonmetric multidimensional scaling, 4 groups were identified, mainly related to the sampling period, with higher spatial variation in species composition during summer. Since environmental legislation in Bosnia and Herzegovina still does not provide detailed instructions on using diatoms in biological assessment, results of this study can be useful for the development of biomonitoring tools for lakes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Ablation from calving and surface melt at lake-terminating Bridge Glacier, British Columbia, 1984-2013	CRYOSPHERE												Bridge Glacier is a lake-calving glacier in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia and has retreated over 3.55 km since 1972. The majority of this retreat has occurred since 1991. This retreat is substantially greater than what has been inferred from regional climate indices, suggesting that it has been driven primarily by calving as the glacier retreated across an overdeepened basin. In order to better understand the primary drivers of ablation, surface melt (below the equilibrium line altitude, ELA) and calving were quantified during the 2013 melt season using a distributed energy balance model (DEBM) and time-lapse imagery. Calving, estimated using areal change, velocity measurements, and assuming flotation were responsible for 23% of the glacier's ablation below the ELA during the 2013 melt season and were limited by modest flow speeds and a small terminus cross-section. Calving and surface melt estimates from 1984 to 2013 suggest that calving was consistently a smaller contributor of ablation. Although calving was estimated to be responsible for up to 49% of the glacier's ablation for individual seasons, averaged over multiple summers it accounted between 10 and 25 %. Calving was enhanced primarily by buoyancy and water depths, and fluxes were greatest between 2005 and 2010 as the glacier retreated over the deepest part of Bridge Lake. The recent rapid rate of calving is part of a transient stage in the glacier's retreat and is expected to diminish within 10 years as the terminus recedes into shallower water at the proximal end of the lake. These findings are in line with observations from other lake-calving glacier studies across the globe and suggest a common large-scale pattern in calving-induced retreat in lake-terminating alpine glaciers. Despite enhancing glacial retreat, calving remains a relatively small component of ablation and is expected to decrease in importance in the future. Hence, surface melt re-mains the primary driver of ablation at Bridge Glacier and thus projections of future retreat should be more closely tied to climate.

A Survey of 46 thaw ponds in the Canadian arctic and subarctic regions showed that these ecosystems have high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nutrients and are relatively productive. This activity was reflected in the optical properties of DOM that indicated a dominance of allochthonous Sources but a significant contribution of low molecular weight compounds. Several subarctic ponds were stratified in summer, resulting in a hypoxic hypolimnion. Most ponds were supersaturated in CO2 and CH4, with higher gas concentrations in bottom waters. However, arctic thaw ponds colonized by benthic microbial mats showed lower CO2 concentrations. likely caused by active photosynthesis. CO2 was correlated with both the quantity and the optical properties of DOM, suggesting the significant role of dissolved compounds from melting organic soils and catchment vegetation on the balance between heterotrophy and autotrophy. The large variability observed in limnological propel-ties of this series of ponds precludes generalisations about their role in greenhouse gas production. However, the fact that all thaw ponds were supersaturated in CH4 underscores the importance of estimating their global significance.

Fueling population growth in Las Vegas: How large-scale groundwater withdrawal could burn regional biodiversity	BIOSCIENCE												Explosive growth in Las Vegas, Nevada, has stimulated demand for additional water supplies. To meet these needs, local officials hope to obtain rights to about 200,000 acre-feet (246 70 million cubic meters [m(3)]) per year from a regional groundwater aquifer extending from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Death Valley, California. Officials from satellite communities are pursuing rights to an additional 870,487 acre-feet (1.07 billion m(3)) per year. If granted, these new permits would trigger declines in groundwater across at least 78 basins covering nearly 130,000 square kilometers. Water-rights decisions have historically interpreted economic development as a more compelling public interest than maintenance of natural systems. If economic development continues to drive allocation decisions, consequent declines in the water table, spring discharge, wetland area, and streamflow will adversely affect 20 federally listed species, 137 other water-dependent endemic species, and thousands of rural domestic and agricultural water users in the region. Reducing consumption and implementing cost-effective technologies, such as recovery of urban runoff and shallow saline groundwater, indirect reuse of potable water, and desalinization, offer ways to meet metropolitan and ecological needs within the limits of the resource.

Clarifying these interactions would be helpful for understanding the physical mechanisms of lake fluctuations and improving responses to extreme hydrological events (i.e., drought or flood). Though numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the flow between rivers and lakes (river-lake interaction), research on the hydrological processes between a lake and its surrounding basin (lake-basin interaction) remains rare. This study investigates lake-basin interactions by examining the changes in the water distribution between the land and a lake with an examination of the Poyang Lake region, China. Specifically, this study first estimates water storage by employing the water balance model. Then, the spatial and temporal correlations between the lake area and soil moisture are examined to capture the lake-land interaction. The results show that the region's annual water storage has decreased in recent decades and varies in different months. Specifically, more water in the region is stored in the lake before July, and increasing amounts of water are held on land after that. Spatially, soil moisture is low in the region near the lake in summer because of the high radiation of water reflectance, which enhances evapotranspiration. By contrast, soil moisture is high in other seasons because of the flow from top to bottom. It can be concluded that soil moisture could mitigate the change in water storage due to the shrinkage of Poyang Lake, which is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variabilities. The results of this study help elucidate the dynamics and distribution of water resources in similar RLB systems, support water management and promote local sustainable development.					; GU, Xiaodong/C-4568-2016	gu, xiaodong/0000-0002-0861-490X; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2019	104						306	312		10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.018													WOS:000470966000031

Impacts of Tile Drainage on Phosphorus Losses from Edge-of-Field Plots in the Lake Champlain Basin of New York	WATER												Quantifying the influence of tile drainage on phosphorus (P) transport risk is important where eutrophication is a concern. The objective of this study was to compare P exports from tile-drained (TD) and undrained (UD) edge-of-field plots in northern New York. Four plots (46 by 23 m) were established with tile drainage and surface runoff collection during 2012-2013. Grass sod was terminated in fall 2013 and corn (Zea mays L.) for silage was grown in 2014 and 2015. Runoff, total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total suspended solids (TSS) exports were measured from April 2014 through June 2015. Mean total runoff was 396% greater for TD, however, surface runoff for TD was reduced by 84% compared to UD. There was no difference in mean cumulative TP export, while SRP and TSS exports were 55% and 158% greater for UD, respectively. A three day rain/snowmelt event resulted in 61% and 84% of cumulative SRP exports for TD and UD, respectively, with over 100% greater TP, SRP and TSS exports for UD. Results indicate that tile drainage substantially reduced surface runoff, TSS and SRP exports while having no impact on TP exports, suggesting tile drains may not increase the overall P export risk.																				2073-4441				FEB	2020	12	2							328	10.3390/w12020328	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12020328													WOS:000519846500019

Traps were exposed for approximately 120 days during the summer months before collection. Rates of sedimentation in both top and bottom traps were compared to 32 catchment, morphometric and water column parameters in an attempt to identify the processes which influence sediment accumulation. Using only lake water pH, maximum lake depth (D(max)) and lake surface area (A(o)), 67 % of the variance in the bottom trap sedimentation rates was explained. Only pH and A(o) were useful predictors for the top traps. Using the bottom traps as a measure of gross sedimentation and the top traps as a measure of net sedimentation (plus periphyton growth in the traps), resuspension was separated from net sedimentation in the bottom traps. Resuspension calculated from these data is compared with more conventional methods of calculation.																			0018-8158					JUL 17	1992	235						143	152		10.1007/BF00026207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026207													WOS:A1992JM30800013

A total of 69 species protozoa, most of which might be recorded in the bay for the first time were observed at three stations (MT1, YP1 and YP2). The species number and the species composition of protozoa suggested that the water condition was worse in the port area (MT1) than that in the aquaculture area (YP1 and YP2). Moreover, the functional parameters further indicated that the water quality was the worst at station MT1. Besides, the functional parameters and the diversity index implied that the pollution stress might be stronger at YP2 than YP1. Such results coincided with the pollution status indicated by water chemical parameters.																					978-981-4366-48-9				2012																								WOS:000311609100243
J	Arai, T				Arai, Tadashi			Waters as a Physical Environment of Japan : From the Viewpoint of Physical Geography	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI												This article summarizes the nature and the behavior of waters in Japan from the viewpoint of physical geography. Because Japan is located in a humid temperate zone lacking a severe dry season, a water deficit is not detected in normal years in terms of water balance analysis. Mean annual specific discharge is between 3 m(3)/s/100 km(2) and 5 m(3)/s/100 km(2) in many river basins, although it is more than 5 m(3)/s/100 km(2) in rainy or snowy regions. Snow is an important source of rivers in Japan. Lakes are relatively abundant. Basin profiles are characterized by steep slopes, reflecting the general landform of Japan. Lakes of volcanic origins and coastal lakes are widely distributed. Strong thermal stratification is also a characteristic of lakes. There are about 210,000 irrigation ponds, which is one of the special features in Japan. Heavy snowfalls in mountain ranges in northern Japan create perennial snow patches. As summer is very hot, the occurrence of snow patches needs an accumulation of snow of more than 20 m. Groundwater is also abundant, especially at flood plains, alluvial fans, and bases of large volcanoes. On plains where rice paddies are distributed, the groundwater level rises during the irrigation period due to seepage. Groundwater is also influenced by human activities as rivers and lakes.																			0022-135X	1884-0884					2007	116	1			SI		7	22																WOS:000446249200002

[USA]. In lake water samples maintained in the laboratory, decreases in soluble Mn2+ and the formation of MnO2 occurred only in summer samples which supported metabolically active Mn-oxidizing bacteria. The effect of initial Mn2+ concentrations on Mn oxidation and on the disappearance of soluble Mn2+ (binding) was studied in water enriched from natural levels (1.2 .+-. 0.4 .mu.M in June and 0.48 .mu.M in Aug. 1979) to 9.1-200 .mu.M Mn2+. Highly enriched lake water (.gtoreq. 65 .mu.M Mn2+) inhibited Mn oxidation. Binding and oxidation of Mn was inhibited in filtered samples when particles > 0.4 .mu.m were removed and inhibition persisted when the particles were first ethanol treated and then reintroduced into filtered lake water. Within the range of 0-20 .mu.M Mn2+ rates of Mn2+ binding varied with the initial Mn2+ concentrations in Aug. water samples.

A statistical test for linearity is applied to 15 millennial-long proxy records with an annual resolution that was shown to significantly respond to Northern Hemisphere annual mean temperature selected from a collection of 30 proxies. The test, based on generalized additive modeling, shows that most of the proxies can indeed be shown to be linear functions of annual mean temperature. hut two proxy records do not appear to have a linear relationship with temperature-this supports the assumption of linearity in most climate reconstruction work. The method tests for nonlinearity in a proxy relative to the group of proxies with which it is being used together. The robustness of the results is tested, and it was found that the results are stable to the choice of proxies. The linearity-testing method is quite general and could in the future be used for larger and more extensive sets of proxies.

Relationship between dissolved organic and inorganic compounds in tributaries of the Lake Baikal	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												It was shown that the balance between organic and inorganic compounds is mostly conditioned by watershed size and relief, rather than chemistry. The rise and fall of dissolved organic carbon concentration are irreversely proportional to those of acid neutralizing capacity and follow the changes in water flowpaths. This relationship was used to distinguish between dissolved matter sources, and to characterize quantitatively and qualitatively their contribution to surface water chemistry. The proposed approach has restricted applicability to the watersheds composed of sedimentary materials and to the watersheds with high percentage of wetlands. The applicability of the approach is also limited to a variety of environmental conditions. Big watersheds should be divided into lower order subcatchments to reduce uncertainty in interpretation of results. In small and medium watersheds, the proposed approach can be used for predicting water chemistry under different environmental conditions and for tracing contaminants.

The study aimed to evaluate (1) the nature of climate changes that forced the late-Holocene lowering of altitudinal tree limit in the region, the timing of which is known from prior studies based on radiocarbon dating of subfossil wood, and (2) the impact of these vegetational changes on an aquatic ecosystem. Arboreal pollen and plant macrofossil data confirm the persistence of trees in the lake catchment at least from c. 9700 cal. BP until c. 3700 cal. BP. Although growing-season temperature is commonly believed to be the dominant factor driving boreal forest tree-limit variations in the region, a chironomid-based reconstruction of mean July air temperature suggests that local deforestation during the late Holocene was not accompanied by a significant cooling. The tree-limit retreat was more likely caused by increasing effective moisture and declining length of the growing season. The ecohydrological response of Lake Spaime to this combination of climate and vegetational changes included a decline in primary productivity, as indicated by an abrupt decrease in sediment organic matter content, while associated increases in organic delta(13)C, delta(15)N and C/N point to diminished fluxes and altered balance of catchment-derived nutrients following deforestation. The decline in aquatic productivity is also marked by a distinct change in the mineral magnetic properties, from a high magnetic concentration assemblage dominated by fine-grained magnetite of biogenic origin to one dominated by background levels of coarse-grained detrital magnetite.

Seasonal synchronicity of algal assemblages in three Midwestern agricultural streams having varying concentrations of atrazine, nutrients, and sediment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Numerous studies characterizing the potential effects of atrazine on algal assemblages have been conducted using micro- or mesocosms; however, few evaluations focused on in situ lotic algal communities, potentially confounding risk assessment conclusions. This exploratory study, conducted at several sites in the midwestem United States where atrazine is commonly used, presents in situ observations of native algal communities relative to atrazine exposure and other parameters. Planktonic and periphytic algae from three streams in three Midwestern states, having historically differing atrazine levels, were sampled over a 16-week period in 2011 encompassing atrazine applications and the summer algal growth period at each site. Changes in abundance, diversity, and composition of algal communities were placed in the context of hydrological, climatic, and water quality parameters (including components sometimes present in agricultural runoff) also collected during the study. Diatoms dominated communities at each of the three sites and periphyton was much more abundant than phytoplankton. As expected, significant variations in algal community and environmental parameters were observed between sites. However, correspondence analysis plots revealed that patterns of temporal variation in algal communities at each site and in periphyton or phytoplankton were dominated by seasonal environmental gradients. Significant concordance in these seasonal patterns was detected among sites and between phytoplankton and periphyton communities (via procrustes Protest analysis), suggesting synchronicity of algal communities across a regional scale. While atrazine concentrations generally exhibited seasonal trends at the study watersheds; no effects on algal abundance, diversity or assemblage structure were observed as a result of atrazine pulses. This lack of response may be due to exposure events of insufficient concentration or duration (consistent with previously reported results) or the composition of the algal assemblages present. This was in contrast to the effects of elevated flow events, which were associated with significant changes in periphyton abundance, diversity and assemblage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature-related changes in polar cyanobacterial mat diversity and toxin production	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE												One of the fastest rates of recent climate warming has been reported for the Arctic and the maritime Antarctic(1); for example, mean annual temperatures increased by 0.5 degrees C per decade over the Antarctic Peninsula during the past 50 years(2). Owing to their comparatively simple and highly sensitive food webs(3), polar freshwater systems, with cyanobacterial mats representing the dominant benthic primary producers(4), seem well suited for monitoring environmental perturbation, including climate change(5). Prolonged climate change may challenge the resilience, plasticity and adaptability and thus affect the community composition of cyanobacterial mats. We demonstrate that exposing polar mat samples to raised temperatures for six months results in a change in species predominance. Mats exposed to a constant temperature of 8 degrees C or 16 degrees C showed high cyanobacterial diversity, commensurate with an increased presence of cyanobacterial toxins. In contrast, mats held at 4 degrees C and 23 degrees C seemed low in diversity. Our data thus indicate that a temperature shift to 8-16 degrees C, potentially reached during summer months in polar regions at the present warming rate, could affect cyanobacterial diversity, and in some instances result in a shift to toxin-producing species or to elevated toxin concentrations by pre-existing species that could profoundly alter freshwater polar ecosystems.

Monthly and annual averages are presented for the whole area as well as for 9 other source areas. The highest Al values were found in the summer months of May, June and July. The area around lake Chad has the highest value and, contrary to the other sources, is active throughout the year. The first 4 years of the research period has a significantly lower index value as compared with the later years. There is a sharp discontinuity between the years 1982 and 1983 in the western sources and a more moderate increase in the eastern sources. Two periods with very high Al values are identified, namely 1983-1984 and 1987-1988, while the year 1986 had a low index value. In 1991 and, to a lesser extent, in 1992, very high Al values were obtained in the eastern sources.

J	Havens, KE				Havens, KE			Submerged aquatic vegetation correlations with depth and light attenuating materials in a shallow subtropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A 3-year study was done to quantify the biomass of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and its relationship with environmental attributes in Lake Okeechobee, the largest lake in the southeastern United States. Plants were sampled on 21 occasions at sites located along 15 fixed transects around the shoreline, giving rise to 721 observations of SAV species (Chara spp., Vallisneria americana, Hydrilla verticillata, Potamogeton illinoinensis) dry weight biomass. Environmental sampling focused on factors that attenuate light, including phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chl a), total suspended solids (TSS), non-volatile suspended solids (NVSS) and color. Depth and Secchi transparency also were measured. Based on regression analysis, NVSS was considerably more important in attenuating light than chl a or color. Total biomass of SAV varied from 0 to 271 g dw m(-2), with a mean of 4.7 g dw m(-2), and strong dominance by Chara. The SAV biomass was lower than average for Florida lakes, and may reflect the influence of suspended solids on underwater irradiance, as well as high water level in the late 1990s. Dense SAV was found only where depth was < 2 m and TSS < 20 - 30 mg l(-1). At locations where high biomass of SAV occurred, the plants may have influenced water quality, because concentrations of TSS, NVSS, and chl a were 2 - 3 fold lower than at sites with no plants. The potential effects of SAV also were apparent at a regional scale. The shoreline region of the lake displayed a pattern of rising and falling chl a and NVSS with water depth. This occurred both at sites with and without plants, suggesting that it may be driven by physical processes, such as water circulation patterns, which are influenced by depth. However, the pattern was dampened at sites with SAV, indicating a potential to influence these attributes of water quality.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2003	493	1-3					173	186		10.1023/A:1025497621547	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1025497621547													WOS:000184957700013

Internal processing and N2 balance in Upper Midwest lakes across a land use gradient	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Excess nitrogen (N) in freshwater systems is harmful and can lead to eutrophication, loss of biodiversity and toxic cyanobacterial blooms. External loading of N is an important driver of eutrophication, however, internal processing can either exacerbate or relieve excess N through N-2 fixation or denitrification, respectively. Here, we aimed to determine how variation in N loading and hydrologic setting affect internal N processing in lakes in summer by quantifying N-2 saturation in 17 lakes across a land use gradient in Minnesota and Iowa. We hypothesized that lakes with the highest N loading rates would have the highest N-2 saturation values, indicative of net denitrification. We observed that lakes in agricultural regions had the highest N-2 saturation and all lakes showed the highest levels of supersaturation in June when runoff was maximal. Although seasonal changes affected the degree of N-2 saturation, all lakes were sources of N-2 to the atmosphere throughout the sample period suggesting that denitrification was more impactful to internal processing than was N-2-fixation. Peaks in N-2 supersaturation co-occurred with both low and high dissolved oxygen levels, the latter being somewhat paradoxical given that denitrification is an anaerobic process.

Results show that the precipitation amount (PA), frequency (PF), and intensity (PI) are zonally distributed over Jiangsu. The precipitation shows distinct diurnal cycle and zonal distribution. The large precipitation is located over the southwest side of the Jiangsu section of Yangtze River (JSYR). From midnight to noon, the precipitation expands northeastward, but the precipitation shrinks southeastward from noon to midnight. Meanwhile, the PA is larger during the daytime than that during the nighttime over most Jiangsu. In addition, the PA shows two diurnal peaks, with one in the early morning mainly resulting from the long-duration rainfall and the other in the afternoon resulting from the short-duration rainfall. The total rainfall is largely contributed by the long-duration rainfall. During the whole warm season, water vapor convergence (divergence) and ascending (sinking) movements are consistent, corresponding to the long-duration precipitation diurnal cycles. The contribution of rainfall with long (short) duration to the total rainfall over most areas shows very distinct sub-seasonal variations with a clear decreasing (increasing) trend from pre-Meiyu through Meiyu to post-Meiyu. Among the three subperiods in a warm season, the PA and diurnal cycle of the total rainfall are mostly contributed by those during the Meiyu period. The long-duration precipitation is closely related to the enhancement of the water vapor convergence during the pre-Meiyu period. However, during the Meiyu and post-Meiyu periods, the long-duration precipitation is more consistent with the dynamic lift since the water vapor is abundant. Concluded from the cluster analysis, precipitation spatial distributions are closely associated with the underlying surface, such as the Yangtze River, big cities, Lake Taihu, Lake Hongze, and complex coastal lines. The diurnal variation of the rainfall over different underlying surfaces shows respective diurnal cycle features.

Recreation-linked management issues are the foci of the survey and this discussion. Survey responses to contingent valuation method (CVM) queries included in the questionnaire quantify visitor recreation values. The CVM estimates of the benefits provided by potential resource improvements are compared with the costs of the improvements in a benefit-cost analysis. The CVM questions covered three resources management issues including water quality improvement, sport fish harvest enhancement, and archeological site protection and restoration. The estimated benefits are remarkably high relative to the costs and range from $6 to $60 million per year The dichotomous choice format was used in each of three resource CVM question scenarios. There were two levels of enhancement for each resource. There are, therefore, several consistency requirements - some of them unique to the dichotomous choice format - that the data and benefit estimates must satisfy. These consistency tests are presented in detail in the ensuing analysis.																			0250-8060	1941-1707				SEP	2004	29	3					375	383		10.1080/02508060408691791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060408691791													WOS:000234618500012

Part II: Simulation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												The Keweenaw Current, observed along the coast of the Keweenaw Peninsula in Lake Superior during July 1973, was simulated using a 3D, nonorthogonal coordinate transformation, primitive equation coastal ocean model. The model domain covered the entire lake with a high resolution of 250-600 m in the cross-shelf direction and 4-6 km in the alongshelf direction along the peninsula. The model was initialized using the monthly averaged temperature field observed in June 1973 and was run prognostically with synoptic wind forcing plus monthly averaged heat flux. Good agreement was found between model-predicted and observed currents at buoy stations near Eagle Harbor. Comparison of the model results with and without inclusion of heat flux suggested that combined wind and heat fluxes played a key role in the intensification of the Keweenaw Current during summer months. The model-predicted relatively strong near-inertial oscillations occurred episodically under conditions of a clockwise-rotating wind. These oscillations intensified at the surface, were weak near the coast, and increased significantly offshore.

Total phytoplankton biomass (ranging from 1.5 to 181.3 mg dm(-3)) was typical of blooms of different intensity, which can appear during a whole growing season but are the most severe in early or late summer. Our results suggested that steady-state and non-steady-state bloom assemblages including mono-, bi- and multi-species or heterogeneous blooms may occur in urban lakes. The most intense blooms were formed by the genera of Cyanobacteria: Microcystis, Limnothrix, Pseudanabaena, Planktothrix, Bacillariophyta: Cyclotella and Dinophyta mainly Ceratium and Peridinium. Considering the sensitivity of phytoplankton assemblages, a new eco-sensitivity factor was proposed (E-SF), based on the concept of Phytoplankton Trophic Index composed of trophic scores of phytoplankton taxa along the eutrophication gradient: The E-SF values of 0.5, 1.3, 6.7 and 15.1 were recognized in lakes having a high, good, moderate or poor ecological status, respectively. For lake restoration, each type of bloom should be considered separately because of different sensitivities of taxa and relationships with environmental variables. Proper recognition of the taxa-specific response to abiotic (especially to N and P enrichment) and biotic factors could have significant implications for further water protection and management (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Coarse Woody Habitat, Lakeshore Residential Development, and Largemouth Bass Nesting Behavior	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Lakeshore residential development (LRD) is associated with both low riparian tree density and reduced structural complexity of the littoral zone. Fallen trees from riparian zones (coarse woody habitat [CWH]) provide littoral structure for fish refuge, substrate for invertebrate production, and habitat for nesting fish. We performed a subsurface viewing and snorkel survey comparing the spawning behavior of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides in six lakes that span the known regional gradients of CWH and LRD in Wisconsin's Northern Highlands Lake District. We tested for differences in the water depth at nest sites and the nest distance to littoral structures (including every dock encountered) among lakes with contrasting CWH or LRD density. Largemouth bass nested under or near CWH in lakes with high CWH density. In lakes with low CWH, many males nested near CWH; however, nests contained smaller pieces of wood and were established in deeper water within low-CWH lakes than within high-CWH lakes. No nests were closer to a dock than to CWH, which suggested that docks do not act as surrogates for CWH. Habitat alterations associated with LRD significantly affect largemouth bass nest site location, and an understanding of these impacts will be important for maintaining viable populations of this prized game fish as LRD pressures expand.

Donegal, Ireland	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Western Ireland, located adjacent to the North Atlantic, and with a strongly oceanic climate, is potentially sensitive to rapid and extreme climate change. We present the first high-resolution chironomid-inferred mean July temperature reconstruction for Ireland, spanning the late-glacial and early Holocene (LGIT, 15-10 ka BP). The reconstruction suggests an initial rapid warming followed by a short cool phase early in the interstadial. During the interstadial there are oscillations in the inferred temperatures which may relate to Greenland Interstadial events GI-1a-e. The temperature decrease into the stadial occurs in two stages. This two-stage drop can also be seen in other late-glacial chironomid-inferred temperature records from the British Isles. A stepped rise in temperatures into the Holocene, consistent with present-day temperatures in Donegal, is inferred. The results show strong similarities with previously published LGIT chironomid-inferred temperature reconstructions, and with the NGRIP oxygen-isotope curve, which indicates that the oscillations observed in the NGRIP record are of hemispherical significance. The results also highlight the influence of the North Atlantic on the Irish climate throughout the LGIT. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.					; Turney, Chris/P-8701-2018; Birks, H.

It occurs widely in static waters such as ponds and ditches, sheltered littoral areas of lakes, and slow-flowing streams. Field observations of its seasonal distribution suggest that the 70-mu m-wide filament form of Spirogyra should have a cool temperature and high irradiance optimum for net photosynthesis. Measurements of net photosynthesis and respiration were made at 58 combinations of light and temperature in a controlled environment facility. Optimum conditions were 25 degrees C and 1500 mu mol photons . m(-2). s(-1), at which net photosynthesis averaged 75.7 mg O-2 . gdm(-1). h(-1). Net photosynthesis teas positive at temperatures from 5 degrees to 35 degrees C at most irradiances except at combinations of extremely low irradiances and high temperatures (7 and 23 mu mol photons . m(-2). s(-1) at 30 degrees C and 7, 23, and 35 mu mol photons . m(-2). s(-1) at 35 degrees C). Respiration rates increased with both temperature and prior irradiance. Light-enhanced respiration rates were significantly greater than dark respiration rates following irradiances of 750 mu mol photons . m(-2). s(-1) or greater. Polynomials were fitted to the data to generate response surfaces; such response surfaces can be used to represent net photosynthesis and respiration in ecological models. The data indicate that the alga can tolerate the cool water and high irradiances characteristic of early spring but cannot maintain positive net photosynthesis under conditions of high temperature and low light (e.g. when exposed to self-shading).																			0022-3646					AUG	1995	31	4					531	540		10.1111/j.1529-8817.1995.tb02546.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.1995.tb02546.x													WOS:A1995RR62600005

Here, we used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to estimate pairwise niche overlaps between non-indigenous and native consumers in the winter food web of Lake Trasimeno (central Italy). Overall, a relatively low pairwise overlap of isotopic niches was observed between NIS and native species. The only exception was the Louisiana crayfish Procambarus clarkii, which showed a relatively high and diffuse overlap with other native invertebrates. Our findings highlighted a high niche divergence between non-indigenous and native species in Lake Trasimeno, suggesting a potentially low degree of interspecific competition that may facilitate coexistence and, in turn, limit the strength of impacts. The divergent results obtained for the Louisiana crayfish indicate that additional control measures for this invasive species are needed to mitigate its impact on the Lake Trasimeno system.

J	Minor, EC; Oyler, AR				Minor, Elizabeth C.; Oyler, Alan R.			Dissolved organic matter in large lakes: a key but understudied component of the carbon cycle	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The world's largest five freshwater lakes include tropical meromictic, temperate weakly stratified, and temperate holomictic lakes ranging in age from twenty-five million to similar to 10,000 years old. They contain > 50% of Earth's surface liquid freshwater and 15% of Earth's lake-water dissolved organic carbon. Large lakes, however, are understudied in terms of carbon cycling, including the roles of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and at the compound class or molecular level. Existing data show that the five largest lakes have lower DOC and CDOM concentrations and clearer water than the global lake median. In Baikal, Superior, and Michigan, however, CDOM is the main non-water absorber of visible light. DOM in these three lakes contain a large proportion of reworked, terrestrially-derived organic matter. Isotopic data for Lake Superior show that its DOM consists of carbon converted into organic matter in the previous decade, though it is difficult to resolve if this organic matter is terrestrial or autochthonous material. No DOC or CDOM characterization or reactivity data exist for the tropical large lakes. Large lakes seem to fall on a continuum with smaller lakes and ocean water, in which water residence time (WRT) and DOC age are linearly related and DOC concentration is negatively correlated with log(WRT). However, existing data are sparse and the mechanisms behind these trends remain to be determined.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				MAY	2023	164	1			SI		295	318		10.1007/s10533-020-00733-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-020-00733-z		JAN 2021											WOS:000604484200003
J	Kingsford, RT; Norman, FI				Kingsford, RT; Norman, FI			Australian waterbirds - products of the continent's ecology	EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY												Some aspects of the ecology of 93 waterbird species, found predominantly on freshwater ecosystems, are reviewed. These species, belonging to six major orders - Anseriformes (ducks, geese and Black Swan), Podicipediformes (grebes), Pelecaniformes (Australian Pelican and cormorants), Ciconiiformes (herons, ibis, spoonbills and bitterns), Gruiformes (cranes, rails, crakes and gallinules), and Charadriiformes (waders and terns) - use a wide range of habitats and about half occur throughout the continent. Knowledge of their ecology remains poor for many waterbirds, particularly cryptic and rare species, and is moderate to good for hunted species. Life histories of Australian waterbirds differ from their counterparts elsewhere. Australia's highly variable climate and river-flooding patterns create wetland habitats, the spatial and temporal variability of which strongly influence the ecology of local waterbirds. Many waterbirds respond to newly generated habitats to feed and/or breed and then disperse or die as wetlands dry Regular movements are not common in most Australian species although some, particularly waders, migrate between Northern Hemisphere breeding grounds and non-breeding habitat in Australia. Breeding of Australian waterbirds coincides with food abundance in the southern spring, the wet season in the tropics and following floods inland. Habitat loss through draining of wetlands, regulation of rivers, diversion of water for irrigation and floodplain development are currently the major threats to waterbirds. Other potentially threatening processes include exotic plants and animals, pollution, climate change and over-harvesting but evidence for the impact of these factors remains poor. Understanding of waterbird, particularly waterfowl, ecology has contributed significantly to the conservation management of wetlands in Australia. Research on single species, studies of movements using satellite technology, further investigation of the effects of hunting, long-term monitoring and large-scale analyses of the availability of wetland habitat should be future research priorities.

In the context of these combined changes, understanding the interactions between global and local forcing has become a major challenge for developing sustainable fisheries. We analyzed commercial landing statistics of Lake Geneva to describe the long-term changes in the abundance of exploited fish species and to identify mechanisms responsible for fish population changes. We showed a significant relationship between the decrease in phosphorus concentrations and structural changes in the composition of the fish community. Local management of reducing phosphorus loadings played a major role in the recovery of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) spawning areas and slowed the process toward more climate-induced percid and cyprinid communities. In addition, rising spring water temperatures have increased whitefish larval growth rates and improved whitefish recruitment. Unexpectedly, climate change and phosphorus reduction can have synergistic effects, and our results highlight the need to consider interactions between global and local anthropogenic forcing to fully understand and predict lake fish population variability in a warming world.					; GUILLARD, Jean/A-2577-2011; Lobry, Jeremy/C-1925-2012	Guillard, Jean/0000-0003-0116-1167; Vogel, Camille/0000-0002-9590-5982; Lobry, Jeremy/0000-0002-4567-3714													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	1					65	76		10.1080/20442041.2017.1294350	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1294350													WOS:000405859800008

The first systematic nesting study of a waterbird dependent on this region for breeding was conducted on the Bar-headed Goose (Anser indicus). The purpose of this study was to document Bar-headed Goose nesting locations, characterize nests and nesting strategies, and estimate daily nest survival (n = 235 nests) from eight areas of west-central Mongolia across three summers (2009-2011) using a modified Mayfield estimator. Bar-headed Goose daily nest survival ranged from 0.94 to 0.98, with a 3-year average nest success of 42.6% during incubation. Bar-headed Geese were found to primarily nest on isolated pond and lake islands as previously reported, but were also documented regularly, though less frequently, along rocky cliffs in several regions of west-central Mongolia. Daily nest survival was higher for cliff nests than for island nests. Information-theoretic models indicated that nest survival decreased with nest age and varied annually with changing environmental conditions. Results of this study suggest that while Bar-headed Geese primarily rely on nesting island sites these sites may be more susceptible to anthropogenic disturbance and predation events influenced by seasonal variation in environmental conditions, and that higher daily nest survival values documented for the less frequent cliff nest strategy may provide an important alternative strategy during poor island nest success years. Thus, conservation efforts for this and other waterbird species in the semiarid region should be focused on conserving nesting islands and protecting them from disturbance in areas of high livestock densities experiencing a rapidly warming climate.

J	Munawar, M; Fitzpatrick, M				Munawar, M.; Fitzpatrick, M.			Microbial - Planktonic foodweb dynamics of a eutrophic Area of Concern: Hamilton Harbour	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour, located on the western end of Lake Ontario, has a long history of cultural eutrophication as well as industrial contamination. We explored the structure and function of the microbial - planktonic foodweb during the growing seasons (May-October) of 2004 and 2006 in order to consider the flow of autochthonous production from lower to higher trophic levels. Our analyses included microscope based assessments of bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, phytoplankton and zooplankton as well as radioisotope based measurements of primary productivity and bacterial growth. While routine measures of total phosphorus (avg: 25-33 mu g l(-1)) and chlorophyll a (avg: 12-15 mu g l(-1)) were indicative of eutrophy, mean phytoplankton biomass in 2004 (2.0 g m(-3)) and 2006 (2.2 g m(-3)) suggested mesotrophic conditions. However, the appearance of algal blooms in the summer of 2006 was an obvious indicator of cultural eutrophication. With respect to the microbial planktonic foodweb, the organic carbon pool increased from a mean of 757.5 mg C m(-3) in 2004 to 1160.3 mg C m(-3) in 2006 and this increase was almost evenly split between autotrophs (198.7 mg C m(-3)) and heterotrophs (204.1 mg C m(-3)). The increased autotrophic carbon is readily attributable to the observed algal blooms driven by warmer temperatures and higher concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus. However, the increase in heterotrophic carbon, primarily heterotrophic nanoflagellates, was apparent from the earliest observations in 2006 and remained consistently high throughout the year. We hypothesize that the increased heterotrophic carbon was the consequence of increased allochthonous carbon being shunted through the microbial foodweb; the energy generated was not likely transferred to zooplankton and passed on to higher trophic levels. More research into the dynamics of allochthonous and autochthonous carbon in eutrophic environments is called for.

We present here the record of Pediastrum species and discuss the climate-mediated changes in the aquatic ecosystem, as reflected by aquatic proxies (e.g. aquatic plants and mosses, cladocerans, ostracods, bryozoan statoblasts), as well as a number of other proxies (organic content, biogenic silica, carbonates, terrestrial plant macrofossils). Climate had warmed to such an extent at c. 12,500 C-14 yrs BP that aquatic life could begin. Productivity was low and only very scarce indication of a warmer interval predating the Allerod chronozone was found. At the beginning of the Allerod chronozone climate ameliorated and productivity clearly increased. The cool climate of the Younger Dryas chronozone (YD) was more clearly reflected in the terrestrial ecosystem than in the aquatic ecosystem, where productivity appeared to remain rather high. The lake was very shallow and non-stratified during the YD, indicating low effective moisture. Probably it warmed throughout early in the open-water season and in that way enabled higher productivity, even if summer temperatures were rather low. It is also possible that the difference in July temperatures between the late part of the Allerod chronozone and the YD was not large in central Jutland. The amelioration of climate at the beginning of the Holocene is clearly reflected in all proxies. There is also evidence that the lake level rose. The lake probably remained alkaline during all of its history but some evidence suggests that pH was somewhat lowered during the YD chronozone. Pediastrum species appear to be relatively good indicators of environmental conditions; similarly, the concentrations may reflect productivity variations during changing climatic conditions.

J	Beier, U				Beier, Ulrika			Temperature- and light-dependent ratio of energy gain to metabolic costs explains spatial and temporal habitat use of zooplanktivorous fish	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Understanding the forces that drive habitat selection of species in communities is important in both ecology and evolution. In nature, species face variation in competition, predation and physical characters among habitats. Vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) is a specialised zooplanktivorous fish predominantly using deeper water in lakes during summer, while roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) uses mainly the shallow littoral zone as well as the upper layer of the pelagic zone. To understand mechanisms behind habitat use of these species, I first conducted a predation experiment to investigate their sensitivity to predation by perch (Perca fluviatilis L.). Second, I performed a foraging experiment using different temperature and light treatments. I then used metabolic calculations to estimate energetic costs when foraging. I found no difference between species regarding sensitivity to predation. Vendace was the most efficient forager on zooplankton but also swam faster spending more energy compared to roach. Roach had a comparatively high metabolic rate in the lowest temperature, where their foraging efficiency was lowest. The energy gain ratio at 6 degrees C was highest for vendace, while it was lowest for roach. In the highest temperature (18 degrees C) and the lowest light level (1lux), both species were similar in their energy gain ratio. The relative energy gain ratio provides a mechanism to explain habitat distribution for the two species. An increased understanding of the role of metabolism in combination with biotic interactions and habitat use may help to foresee effects of environmental change for different species.

The gases were trapped in a solid adsorbent, Molecular Sieve 5 .ANG. (80-100 mesh). RSCs were backflushed onto a gas chromatographic separation column after thermal desorption from the trap. The RSCs were detected with a sulfur specific dual flame photometric detector. RSCs in fresh samples from two meromictic lakes in the Vesthold Hills (Antarctica) were quantified with this method. A profile of DMS in Antarctic seawater was obtained during a period of phytoplankton bloom in the Antarctic summer. DMS, carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide were the major RCSs found. A study of recoveries from samples preserved for eight months with mercuric chloride showed that substancial losses of RSCs occurred. Carbon disulfide was detected in preserved samples from the lakes studied. Detection limits of DMS and carbonyl sulfide were 10 ng 1-1 and 5 ng 1-1 respectively.																			0021-9673					JUL 4	1986	362	1					9	21		10.1016/S0021-9673(01)86946-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9673(01)86946-6													WOS:A1986D256900002

It has high value for preservation and scientific research. However, the wetlands in this lake have been severely degraded by the long history of human activities such as excavation of salt and sodium sulfate ponds and agriculture. Based on the analysis of hydrological and water quality conditions of the existing wetlands, an overall consideration of the wetland types, resource status, distribution of target species, and the water source, the study suggests a series of engineering measures to restore wetland ecosystem and improve ecological environmental quality in Luyang Lake. The engineering projects mainly include the following aspects: i) connect water system through cutting of drainages and, retreat farmlands to lakes or wetlands, ii) construct artificial wetland to purify polluted waters, iii) improve the habitat so as to provide excellent staging, breeding, and wintering habitats for wetland birds.																					978-0-7695-4923-1; 978-1-4673-4893-5				2013							1221	1224		10.1109/ISDEA.2012.287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISDEA.2012.287													WOS:000319283600284

Holomictic Soppensee is characterized by a strong summer stratification with a thin epilimnion separated from an anoxic hypolimnion by a strong pycnocline formed by thermal and chemical gradients. A vertical one-dimensional model was developed to simulate the observed seasonal cycles of carbon and oxygen. The processes of net community production, mineralization of organic matter, precipitation and dissolution of calcite, gas exchange, in- and outflow, sedimentation and vertical eddy diffusion are included. According to the model, the annual net community production is estimated to about 110 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and the annual net primary production to about 330 to 440 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which is a typical value for eutrophic lakes. A mass balance of the carbon cycle indicates that most of the inflow comes from groundwater which is super-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO(2). Therefore the surface waters exhibit a large capacity for calcite precipitation. The results of the model are used to constrain the conditions that favor the formation of varved sediments in Soppensee during thousands of yrs. Model calculations show that the deep waters would still turn anoxic even if the sedimentation rate of organic matter were decreased to 25%. Several physical factors such as biogenic stabilization of the deep waters due to calcite dissolution and low input of wind energy are responsible for the long term anoxia in Soppensee.

Revision of the African cichlid fish genus Ctenochromis (Teleostei, Cichliformes), including a description of the new genus Shuja from Lake Tanganyika and the new species Ctenochromis scatebra from northern Tanzania	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TAXONOMY												Molecular phylogenetic evidence clearly resolves the African cichlid fish genus Ctenochromis, as defined by Greenwood (1979), as paraphyletic. Here, we redefine the genus Ctenochromis and assign Ctenochromis horei, a member of the Tropheini from Lake Tanganyika, to a new genus Shuja gen. nov. We restrict Ctenochromis to Ctenochromis pectoralis and Ctenochromis scatebra sp. nov., both of which are endemic to the Pangani River catchment in northern Tanzania, and are resolved as sister taxa in a phylogenetic analysis using genome-wide data. Ctenochromis pectoralis is the type species of the genus and described from specimens collected near Korogwe, Tanzania. The species was declared extinct in a 2016 IUCN Red List Assessment. We confirm the continued presence of a population of C. pectoralis within the Ruvu tributary linking Lake Jipe to Nyumba ya Mungu Reservoir. The new taxon Ctenochromis scatebra sp. nov. is described from Chemka Springs, and recognised on the basis of differences from C. pectoralis in tooth and jaw morphology.					; Hsu, Ling-Lan/GZL-4748-2022	SHECHONGE, ASILATU/0000-0002-9228-0323; Smith, Alan/0000-0002-4181-564X; Hsu, Ling-Lan/0009-0006-8703-225X; Collins, Rupert A./0000-0002-9135-1169; Genner, Martin/0000-0003-1117-9168; 														2118-9773				MAY 11	2022	819						23	54		10.5852/ejt.2022.819.1775	http://dx.doi.org/10.5852/ejt.2022.819.1775													WOS:000798739200001

Influence of Invasive Hybrid Cattails on Habitat Use by Common Loons	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												An invasive hybrid cattail species, Typha x glauca (T. x glauca), is rapidly expanding across the United States and Canada. Dense clonal stands of T. x glauca outcompete native wetland plants, reduce open-water habitats, and negatively affect native wetland plant diversity; however, effects of hybrid cattail expansions on native wildlife are still unclear. We used multiple surveys and single-season occupancy models to examine how the relative coverage of T. x glauca affected habitat use by common loons (Gavia immer) at 71 wetland sites in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA, during summer 2016. Delineated wetland sites (2 ha) were considered potential resource patches for common loons and positioned along a gradient of relative T. x glauca coverage. Detection of common loons was influenced negatively by the time of day surveys were conducted. Occupancy probabilities were greater at sites with deeper water levels, possibly indicating selection for areas with adequate water depths for pursuit-based foraging for fish. Contrary to our hypothesis, common loons appeared insensitive to the relative coverage of T. x glauca at wetland sites. Future research should focus on elucidating potential threshold-effects of T. x glauca expansions on additional loon demographic rates. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

This study aimed to study physicochemical parameters in drinking water resources in NW Iran and made an effort to assess the health risk of these parameters. The study was conducted in winter, 2018 on the 16 sampling points in the vicinity of Lake Urmia, NW Iran. Heavy metals (Pb, As, Cd, Ni, Zn, and Cu) and ions (Na+, Ca2+, K+, NO3-, SO42-, and Cl-) were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) and Ion Chromatography (IC), respectively. Non-carcinogenic risk and carcinogenic risk assessments were carried out by probabilistic approach and Monte Carlo simulation, and were expressed by hazard quotient (HQ) and excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) criteria, respectively. The mean values of pH, turbidity, and temperature and ions were within the permissible limits for drinking water according to the recommended range by World Health Organization (WHO). HQ values indicated a reasonable non-carcinogenic risk for Zn and Ni and unacceptable risks for As, Cd, and NO3-. ELCR levels of As were unacceptably high. Finally, it was concluded that groundwater resources in the studied area did not have an acceptable quality for drinking usages due to the risk posed by As, Cd, and NO3-. Therefore, pollution control through finding contamination sources and water treatment are recommended before the use of water resources for drinking consumption.

Potential Role of Prey in the Recovery of American Martens to Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The American marten (Martes americana), the only state-listed endangered mammal in Wisconsin, has undergone serial reintroductions within the state. Recovery has been slower than anticipated and the limiting factors remain unidentified. The lack of basic knowledge on marten foraging in the Great Lakes Region led us to quantify the diet of martens inhabiting the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (CNNF) in northern Wisconsin using a dual approach of scat and stable isotope analyses. We collected marten scat at winter rest sites within the CNNF from 2000-2011. We identified prey items based on morphological characteristics of indigestible prey remains and calculated percent occurrence for each prey item. We sampled marten hair from museum specimens, and opportunistically from carcasses within the CNNF for isotopic analysis. We collected hair and feather samples from potential prey species in the CNNF in 2010-2013. Our concurrent analyses revealed that shrews and deer were most important to the diet of martens in Wisconsin. These findings contrast with studies conducted elsewhere that report voles as the principle diet items, and shrews as one of the least used prey items. Consequently, such a strong reliance on secondary, less profitable or high-risk prey could be contributing to the delayed recovery of martens in Wisconsin.

A legacy of competitive exclusion: Host demography and amplified disease	INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY												Dilution effects arise when increases in species diversity reduce disease risk, and amplification effects arise when the opposite occurs. Despite ample evidence for both phenomena, the mechanisms driving dilution and amplification effects and how they are mediated by environmental factors remain poorly understood. Mechanisms involving demographic rates or stage structure of hosts are particularly lacking in the diversity-disease literature. In Midwestern lakes, Metschnikowia bicuspidata parasites infect Daphnia dentifera focal hosts in autumn, with epidemics beginning when water is warm (similar to 25 degrees C) and peaking when lakes have cooled (similar to 15 degrees C). Epidemics are smaller in lakes with more Ceriodaphnia dubia alternative hosts, which serve as key diluters of disease. However, it is unclear whether seasonal changes in temperature affect their ability to alter host population dynamics and reduce disease. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test how temperature (15, 20, or 25 degrees C) mediated the effects of these key alternative hosts on density, stage structure, and disease dynamics in focal host populations. The experiment yielded several surprising results. First, focal hosts rapidly outcompeted alternative hosts at all temperatures. By the time parasites were added, alternative hosts had been almost completely excluded. Second, despite diluting disease in the field, initial presence of these alternative hosts amplified infection prevalence in the experiment. Third, this amplification arose as a legacy effect, lasting generations after alternative hosts were gone. Our explanation for this legacy amplification effect centers on focal host stage structure and demography. Competition with alternative hosts resulted in focal host populations that were more adult-biased when parasites were added, at all 3 temperatures. Additionally, host densities in these treatments increased more rapidly in the subsequent 10 days, consistent with reduced background death rates. Since adults consume more parasites than juveniles, and since exposed hosts must survive 10 days before producing infectious spores, these initial differences in stage structure and population growth seem to have set disease dynamics along amplified trajectories. These results highlight the need for a broader understanding of the mechanisms that can amplify or dilute disease, including altered host stage structure and mortality of exposed hosts in diverse communities.

Some of the unambiguous and best studied examples of effects of enhanced eutrophication on biotic resources can be found in Louisiana estuaries at the terminus of the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River system. The Mississippi River delta has experienced large losses of coastal wetlands due to a combination of human impacts and sea-level rise. State and Federal agencies are moving ahead with plans for building large-scale river sediment diversions, which will capture maximum sediment during spring flood pulses and direct a sediment subsidy into the eroding coastal basins. These large-scale river sediment diversions will also substantially increase freshwater and nutrient inputs and are likely to affect algal bloom formation, including harmful cyanobacterial blooms. There are concerns that discharge of river water containing high concentrations of N, P and Si may trigger algal blooms in the coastal receiving basins. River sediment diversions, as any other flood pulsing, will likely be disruptive to the coastal ecology and so balancing the benefits of slowing coastal land loss against potential negative effects on water quality remains a formidable management challenge. We review here the physical, chemical and biological factors affecting primary production in shallow coastal systems and provide known data on ecosystem response to freshwater diversions, large and small. We also discuss potential management approaches to mitigate the negative impacts of the diversions on the health and stability of the coastal food webs.

This normally causes a flood wave downstream the glacier. Typically, such an event takes few to several hours. GLOF scenarios may be a significant hazard to life, property, nature and infrastructure in the affected areas. A GLOF is usually characterized by a progressive water level drop. By observing the water level of the lake, an imminent GLOF-event can be identified. Common gauging systems are often not suitable for the measurement task, as they may be affected by ice fall or landslides in the lake basin. Therefore, in our pilot study, the water level is observed by processing images of a terrestrial camera system observing a glacier margin lake. The paper presents the basic principle of an automatic single-camera-based GLOF early warning system. Challenges and approaches to solve them are discussed. First, results from processed image sequences are presented to show the feasibility of the concept. Water level changes can be determined at decimetre precision.

This is the first study to our knowledge reporting cases of mycosis seen in southern Saskatchewan suggesting a broader area of endemicity. We searched the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region (RQHR) Microbiology Laboratory for all culture-confirmed cases of Blastomyces from January 2000 to December 2015 and identified 15 cases. Thirteen cases were reviewed, identifying common presenting symptoms, misdiagnosis, comorbidities, travel history, time from presentation to diagnosis, diagnostic specimen, treatment, and clinical outcome. Nine patients had no travel to areas known to be endemic to environmental blastomycosis. Eight patients presented with respiratory symptoms, four with skin lesions, four with constitutional symptoms, and one presented with chest pain after a fall. Initial misdiagnosis occurred in nine (69%) of the 13 cases, and all six patients that died of the disease were misdiagnosed. These six patients (46%) were acutely ill with refractory disseminated disease, leading to respiratory failure. It is probable that Blastomyces is present as an endemic fungus in the soil of southern Saskatchewan. Possibly due to a lack of awareness of this pathogen in the area, initial misdiagnoses were common and likely contributed to significant morbidity and mortality.																			1369-3786	1460-2709				OCT	2018	56	7					787	795		10.1093/mmy/myx131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mmy/myx131								29924358					WOS:000448007600003

The combination of high-resolution pollen, palynofacies and magnetic susceptibility data allowed reconstruction of changes in sedimentary and vegetation dynamics regionally at Son Kul between 8350 and ca 2000 cal. BP. Using pollen data to quantify climatic parameters, a quantitative reconstruction of climatic conditions was performed using the "Modern Analogue Vegetation types" (MAV) method and a ranged index of seasonality. The most temperate (e.g. moister) climate conditions occurred between 8350 and 5000-4500 cal. BP when alpine meadow vegetation was enriched in plants requiring moister conditions and trees developed regionally. Conversely, more continental and arid conditions prevailed after 4500 cal. BP with the decline of arboreal vegetation (especially Juniperus) and the extension of an alpine steppe-meadow along with a regional decrease in Poaceae. This climate transition was associated with a change in seasonality as the continentality greatly intensified after 5000-4500 cal. BP. Our results are consistent with other records from the Tien Shan range and the Chinese Province Xinjiang showing that relatively wet conditions prevailed regionally before 5000 cal. BP, whereas reduced moisture conditions were established after that time. From a more global perspective, we highlight that regional rainfall in central Tien Shan and western Central Asia is likely to be predominantly controlled by the Eastern Mediterranean cyclonic system and North Atlantic climate, as based on the close correspondence between climatic archives from western Central Asia, the Levant, the Eastern Mediterranean and Caspian Sea regions. However, the effect of monsoonal dynamics on the regional climatic system in central Tien Shan still remains dubious, since recent modelling studies have shown that no dynamic link exists between humidity in Central Asia and the Indian Summer Monsoon. This study pinpoints the need to explore the effect of remote Eurasian atmospheric circulation patterns on past climate variability in Central Asia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite their ecological importance, the response of most arctic fungi to climate warming is unknown, so are their potential roles in driving the observed and predicted changes in tundra communities. We carried out deep DNA sequencing of soil samples to study the long-term effects of experimental warming on fungal communities in dry heath and moist tussock tundra in Arctic Alaska. The data presented here indicate that fungal community composition responds strongly to warming in the moist tundra, but not in the dry tundra. While total fungal richness was not significantly affected by warming, there were clear correlations among operational taxonomic unit richness of various ecological and taxonomic groups and long-term warming. Richness of ectomycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal and lichenized fungi generally decreased with warming, while richness of saprotrophic, plant and animal pathogenic, and root endophytic fungi tended to increase in the warmed plots. More importantly, various taxa within these functional guilds followed opposing trends that highlight the importance of species-specific responses to warming. We recommend that species-level ecological differences be taken into account in climate change and nutrient cycling studies that involve arctic fungi.

J	Cooke, SE; Prepas, EE				Cooke, SE; Prepas, EE			Stream phosphorus and nitrogen export from agricultural and forested watersheds on the Boreal Plain	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We evaluated phosphorus (P) and inorganic nitrogen (IN) export from two agricultural and two forested watersheds on the nutrient-rich but relief-poor Boreal Plain. One agricultural stream was in a watershed that contained cropland, while the second consisted of mixed agricultural activities. Over the 2-year study, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentrations were proportionately high, particularly in the agricultural streams. Flow-weighted TDP averaged 82% of the total phosphorus (TP) in the agricultural streams and 43% in the forested streams. In all watersheds, TDP was almost exclusively dissolved reactive phosphorus and most of the annual P export was in summer. The type of agricultural activity in the watershed influenced IN speciation; in the mixed agricultural watershed, 94% of IN export was ammonium, whereas 98% of IN load was nitrate, from the cropland watershed. Disproportionately high TDP to TP export from agricultural watersheds suggests that, in areas of low relief and relatively high soil water P content, land clearing may influence dissolved more than particulate phosphorus export.																			0706-652X					OCT	1998	55	10					2292	2299		10.1139/f98-118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f98-118													WOS:000077253300009

Information about fish distribution and abundance in the upper water column is often fundamental. However, this information is extremely hard to obtain using classical hydroacoustic methods. We developed a rigid frame system for pushing upward looking transducers of the scientific echo sounder (38 and 120 kHz) in front of the research vessel. The efficiency of the new approach for monitoring juvenile fish at night was investigated by comparing the results with a quantitative fry trawl in the Rimov Reservoir in the Czech Republic. The experimental setup enabled comparisons for the 0-3 m and 3-6 m depth layers, which are utilized by almost all juvenile fish in summer. No statistically significant differences in the estimated abundance of juveniles were found between the two sampling methods. The comparison of abundance estimates gathered by the two frequencies were also not significantly different.

Diurnal variations of temperature as a cause of periodic variations of high-frequency geoacoustic emission	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY												Investigated is the periodic component of geoacoustic emission within the frequency band from 2.0 to 6.5 kHz registered by the piezoceramic hydrophone installed near the bottom of Lake Mikizha in the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is revealed that the variation period is 24 hours and the maximum variation is observed in summer, when the average daily air temperature is above 10A degrees C. In that period the close connection is revealed between the series of air temperature and geoacoustic emission. Taking into account the similar results of measurements of the ground surface slope at the observation site, the most probable reason for the diurnal variations of high-frequency geoacoustic emission is the deformation of near-surface sedimentary rocks caused by diurnal variations of temperature.

Response of Methanogens in Arctic Sediments to Temperature and Methanogenic Substrate Availability	PLOS ONE												Although cold environments are major contributors to global biogeochemical cycles, comparatively little is known about their microbial community function, structure, and limits of activity. In this study a microcosm based approach was used to investigate the effects of temperature, and methanogenic substrate amendment, (acetate, methanol and H-2/CO2) on methanogen activity and methanogen community structure in high Arctic wetlands (Solvatnet and Stuphallet, Svalbard). Methane production was not detected in Stuphallet sediment microcosms (over a 150 day period) and occurred within Solvatnet sediments microcosms (within 24 hours) at temperatures from 5 to 40 degrees C, the maximum temperature being at far higher than in situ maximum temperatures (which range from air temperatures of -1.4 to 14.1 degrees C during summer months). Distinct responses were observed in the Solvatnet methanogen community under different short term incubation conditions. Specifically, different communities were selected at higher and lower temperatures. At lower temperatures (5 degrees C) addition of exogenous substrates (acetate, methanol or H-2/CO2) had no stimulatory effect on the rate of methanogenesis or on methanogen community structure. The community in these incubations was dominated by members of the Methanoregulaceae/WCHA2-08 family-level group, which were most similar to the psychrotolerant hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanosphaerula palustris strain E1-9c. In contrast, at higher temperatures, substrate amendment enhanced methane production in H-2/CO2 amended microcosms, and played a clear role in structuring methanogen communities. Specifically, at 30 degrees C members of the Methanoregulaceae/WCHA2-08 predominated following incubation with H-2/CO2, and Methanosarcinaceaeand Methanosaetaceae were enriched in response to acetate addition. These results may indicate that in transiently cold environments, methanogen communities can rapidly respond to moderate short term increases in temperature, but not necessarily to the seasonal release of previously frozen organic carbon from thawing permafrost soils. However, as temperatures increase such inputs of carbon will likely have a greater influence on methane production and methanogen community structure. Understanding the action and limitations of anaerobic microorganisms within cold environments may provide information which can be used in defining region-specific differences in the microbial processes; which ultimately control methane flux to the atmosphere.						gray, neil/0000-0002-2395-4320; Head, Ian/0000-0002-5373-162X; Tveit, Alexander Tosdal/0000-0002-4163-3416; Blake, Lynsay/0000-0001-8986-3280													1932-6203					JUN 17	2015	10	6							e0129733	10.1371/journal.pone.0129733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129733								26083466					WOS:000356567400106

Methodologically, the practice of summer fallowing and the collection of voqui fuco for the elaboration of artisanal products were taken as examples. Emphasis is placed on the distinction between what is merely a productive practice and what becomes, through this study, an "agrocultural practice." Results demonstrate the need to set aside the arbitrariness of separating the material from the immaterial and propose replacing this separation with the concept of "agrocultural practices," a way to recognize the forms of production and what happens in a particular territory.																			1315-9518					OCT-DEC	2012	18	4					684	701																WOS:000319541200009
J	Alikas, K; Reinart, A				Alikas, Krista; Reinart, Anu			Validation of the MERIS products on large european lakes: Peipsi, Vanern and Vattern	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS/Envisat) was launched in March 2002 for coastal zone monitoring. Preliminary data from MERIS show that its imagery of large lakes is superior to that of other common ocean colour sensors. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the MERIS data on large European lakes, Vanern and Vattern in Sweden and Peipsi in Estonia/Russia. In these lakes, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) can be a major contributor to the optical properties of the water. Another characteristic of the waters under investigation is the large temporal and spatial variability in the concentrations of chlorophyll (C-Chl) and suspended sediments (C-TSS). Potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms occur in Lake Peipsi in late summer. We have compared the MERIS products from the latest reprocessing (finished in March 2006) with available in situ data. There is a reasonably good correlation between the MERIS algal_2 product and the measured C-chl over all three lakes, but no correlation was found for other optically active substances. A significant portion of the pixels (up to 90%) are flagged as invalid results after atmospheric correction.

On crystal violet pectate medium (CVP), colonies examined with oblique light appeared pink and slightly translucent and were surrounded by wide, shallow depressions. Pseudomonads of this colony morphology also were detected in the root zones of potato plants, washwater from a potato chip processing plant, field soils, a Wisconsin [USA] river and lake, and from decaying carrot and cabbage heads. Strains were found in Wisconsin soils just after the spring thaw and thus probably overwintered there. When inoculated into potato tuber and carrot slices, these strains rapidly produced a soft rot which fluoresced under UV light. When inoculated into stems of potato plants or lettuce heads, they caused a localized browning and softening of tissue. On the basis of the biochemical and physiological properties of 62 strains (including 45 from potato tuber surfaces), these bacteria were identified as strains of Pseudomonas marginalis.																			0031-949X	1943-7684					1980	70	11					1110	1115		10.1094/Phyto-70-1110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-70-1110													WOS:A1980KS55200020
J	Serban, C; Maftei, C; Dobrica, G				Serban, Cristina; Maftei, Carmen; Dobrica, Gabriel			Surface Water Change Detection via Water Indices and Predictive Modeling Using Remote Sensing Imagery: A Case Study of Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake, Romania	WATER												Water body feature extraction using a remote sensing technique represents an important tool in the investigation of water resources and hydrological drought assessment. Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake, a component of the Danube Delta Natural Reserve, is located on the Romanian Black Sea littoral. On account of an event in summer 2020, when the lake surface water decreased significantly, this study aims to identify the variation of the Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake surface water over a long-term period in correlation with human intervention and climate change. To this end, it provides an analysis in the period 1965-2021 via hydrological drought indices and data mining classification. The latter approach is based on several water indices derived from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and MODIS full-time series datasets: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Weighted Normalized Difference Water Index (WNDWI), and Water Ratio Index (WRI). The experimental results indicate that the proposed classification methods can extract relevant features from waterbodies using remote sensing imagery with a high accuracy. Moreover, the study shows a similarity in the evolution of surface water cover identified with the data mining classification and the drought periods detected in the flow data series for the Nuntasi and Sacele Rivers that supply the Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake. Overall, the results of our investigation show that human intervention and hydrological drought had an extensive impact on the long-term changes in surface water of the Nuntasi-Tuzla Lake.

The most frequently detected compounds were alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH (lindane), chlorothalonil, pentachlorophenol, atrazine. and endosulfan. Median site concentrations varied between not-detected and 10.2 ng l(-1). Deposition of HCHs (hexachlorocyclohexane), chlorothalonil, and endosulfan at Kejimkujik (Keji) and Jackson, Nova Scotia, were generally similar. Significant spatial differences (p < 0.05), however, were found for the HCH isomers and endosulfan at Keji and Gros Morne (Newfoundland and Labrador), areas geographically separated by the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. Long-term deposition of a-HCH decreased (P < 0.05) at both Keji (1980 2000) and Gros Morne (1994-2000), with half-lives of 5.9 and 4.5 y, respectively. A decreasing trend was also found for pentachlorophenol with a half-life of 4.9 y at Jackson. Significant negative trends (p < 0.05) were observed for alpha-/gamma-HCH ratios during the study at Keji and Jackson, possibly reflecting changes in production and use patterns of technical HCH and lindane on a continental and perhaps hemispheric scale. Seasonal trends for alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH were found to vary over the 20-y study period at Keji, however, spatial trends were generally similar between sites. Seasonal trends were observed with peak deposition generally occurring during the growing period (springy-summer) for the HCHs, chlorothalonil, endosulfan, and atrazine. Bimodal seasonal trends were also observed for these compounds with the exception of endosulfan. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Microbial biomass and diversity declined with increasing sediment depth in both submerged macrophyte-dominated and algae-dominated sites. Dramatic differences in the vertical microbial PLFA profiles of the two ecological sites were observed, indicating different microbial community compositions. RDA analysis also suggested that chlorophyll a, TOC, C/N ratio and pH might be important factors controlling both vertical and between-site variation in microbial abundance and community structure. We highly recommend PLFA as a rapid, sensitive and cost-effective method of assaying biomass and microbial community composition in aquatic researches.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2016	25	8					3213	3220																WOS:000384033100060

Importance of phytoplankton carbon to heterotrophic bacteria in the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee rivers, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The flux of carbon and nutrients through aquatic systems is largely dependent upon interactions between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. As a means of assessing the relative importance of autotrophy and heterotrophy in large rivers, we compared phytoplankton production, heterotrophic bacterial production and community respiration in three regulated rivers of the Midwestern USA. Samples were collected monthly (March to December 1999) from impoundments of the Ohio (McAlpine Pool), Cumberland (Lake Barkley), and Tennessee (Kentucky Lake) Rivers. Bacterial production was tightly coupled to phytoplankton production at each site (r(2) = 0.63-0.85). Ratios of phytoplankton production to bacterial production ranged from < 1 to 15 in the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers and 2 to 90 in the Ohio River. The ratio of primary production to community respiration (P:R) ranged from 0.03 to 2.76 across all sites, with average P:R values lower in the Ohio River (0.14) than the Tennessee River (0.39) and the Cumberland River (1.10). P:R values above unity (P > R) were observed only in the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers during seasonal (April-July) spikes in primary production. We estimate that 3, 6, and 20% of annual bacterial carbon requirements were met by exudates from in situ phytoplankton in the Ohio River, Tennessee River, and Cumberland River, respectively. Our findings indicate that heterotrophic bacteria were largely dependant upon allochthonous carbon. Autochthonous sources provided supplemental organic matter (up to 40% of bacterial carbon demand) during summer low flow.

Anthropogenic oligotrophication via liming: Long-term phosphorus trends in acidified, limed, and neutral reference lakes in Sweden	AMBIO												Restoration of acidified lakes by liming does not, in many cases, improve productivity to a pre-acidified state. We hypothesize that the poor recovery detected in many of these lakes is due to constrained in-lake phosphorous (P) cycling caused by enhanced precipitation of metals in higher pH, limed waters. Long-term (1990-2012) data for 65 limed, circum-neutral (pH 6-8), and acidified lakes in Sweden were analyzed to determine trends for P and potential drivers of these trends. Limed lakes not only had lower mean values and stronger decreasing trends for total P than non-limed lakes, but they also had the highest percentage of decreasing trends (85 %). A P release factor (Hypolimnetic P/Epilimnetic P) was developed to elucidate differences in internal P cycling between lake groups. Consistently, lower P release factors in limed lakes show limitation of internal P cycling during summer months that may be a factor limiting P bioavailability and thus productivity of these systems.

Inorganic carbon availability influences species composition of phytoplankton in acidic and highly alkaline lakes, whereas the overall influence on community photosynthesis and growth is subject to debate. 2. The influence of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and free CO2 on community photosynthesis was studied in six Danish lakes during the summer of 1995. The lakes were selected to ensure a wide range of chlorophyll a concentrations (1-120 mu g l(-1)), pH (5.6-9.6) and DIC concentration (0.02-2.5 mM). Photosynthesis experiments were performed using the C-14 technique in CO2-manipulated water samples, either by changing the pH or by adding/removing CO2. 3. Lake waters were naturally CO2 supersaturated during most of the experimental period and inorganic carbon limitation of photosynthetic rates did not occur under ambient conditions. However, photosynthesis by phytoplankton in lakes with low and intermediate DIC concentrations was seriously restricted when CO2 concentrations declined. Similarly photosynthesis was limited by low CO2 concentrations during phytoplankton blooms in the hardwater alkaline lakes.																			0046-5070					JUN	1997	37	3					545	552		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00180.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00180.x													WOS:A1997XF54000005

Dava Goz is a small site at north of the Lake Urmia, measuring about 100x100m (ca. 1ha). The first season of archeological excavation primarily aimed to clarifying the chronology, settlement organization, and respond to some of the fundamental questions such as the transition process from Late Neolithic to Early Chalcolithic (Hajji Firuz to Dalma) and identifying different cultural horizon including Late Chalcolithic (LC1 and LC2 periods) and also outlining cultural condition of the region during prehistoric periods. The present paper is intended to expose briefly the main stratigraphic, architectural and material data from the site. The stratigraphy of the settlement is now well understood and covers the Late Neolithic/Transitional Chalcolithic (Hajji Firuz/Dalma=Period I) and Chalcolithic (Pisdeli=LC1=Period II and Chaff-Faced Ware horizon=LC2=Period III) phases of the regional culture of north of the Lake Urmia Basin. Actually, Dava Gz is one of the scant well excavated settlements that give new and fresh information on the developments of the Lake Urmia Basin communities between the sixth to fourth millennium BC (5400-3700/3600 BC), and on their relationships with the contemporary Caucasian cultures as well as with those located further west and south, in Eastern Anatolia and in the Syro-Mesopotamian region. The first preliminary result of excavation, suggest special function for Dava Gz. It seems clear that this site could be consider as winter land for some agro-pastoral groups of Lake Urmia Basin who trying to find some pasturelands and preparing same raw materials like obsidian for the settlements of Urmia region The implications of the findings will discuss along with limitations and future research directions.																			1108-9628	2241-8121					2017	17	1					69	87		10.5281/zenodo.258086	http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.258086													WOS:000400150000006
J	Molau, U; Shaver, GR				Molau, U; Shaver, GR			Controls on seed production and seed germinability in Eriophorum vaginatum	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Controls on seed production in Eriophorum vaginatum were studied at two Low Arctic sites, Latnjajaure in Sweden and Toolik Lake in Alaska. At Latnjajaure, seed production was monitored for 3 years (1993-1995) in control plants and in plants that were experimentally warmed using ITEX open-topped chambers (OTCs). At Toolik Lake, experimental treatments included a factorial greenhouse x NP fertilizer experiment and artificial shading: data collection occurred in 1995, after eight seasons of treatment. Temperature differences between sites, years, and treatments all had significant effects on components of Eriophorum seed production. Pre-floration and post-floration times were decreased in warmer treatments and years. Ovule number per inflorescence was greater in warm years and at the warmer site, Toolik Lake. Although seed set was reduced in the OTCs at Latnjajaure, probably due to low pollination rates, in the larger greenhouses at Toolik Lake seed set was increased. The most consistent responses to temperature were in seed weight, where treatment effects were greatest at lower temperatures, such that, for example, at Latnjajaure the increases in seed weight in the OTCs were greatest in the coldest year. Fertilizer treatment had no significant effect on seed number or weight at Toolik Lake, and in the fertilizer + greenhouse treatment there were no inflorescences because Eriophorum had been nearly eliminated from the treated plots. In the shade treatment at Toolik Lake, inflorescences were fertilized but only a single mature seed was collected. Overall, the results indicate that seed production by E. vaginatum is strongly responsive to environmental variation and that only a small increase in mean summer temperatures would result in a much larger and more stable seed production.																			1354-1013					DEC	1997	3			1			80	88		10.1111/j.1365-2486.1997.gcb130.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.1997.gcb130.x													WOS:000071285300009

It serves as a crucial wintering area for numerous western Palearctic birds. A notable decline in species diversity has been observed in the past decade, attributed to excessive water usage for irrigation and the effects of climate change. This study aimed to assess the status of Ichkeul Lake and its catchment through identifying potentially toxic cyanobacteria, and sediment quality. Our first striking finding was that Lyngbya majuscula the dominant potentially toxic cyanobacterium in the lake originated from the Tinja channel. Trace element concentrations in lake sediments exceeded SQG standards which is indicative of rare detrimental effects to biological life. However, the sediment in front of the Tinja channel exhibited high contamination levels of Zn and Cd. These findings call for an urgent need to ensure the ongoing management and conservation of this world heritage site.

Besides highlighting ongoing research advancements in the LPL, the review provides a critical overview of the scientific information available on the large lake's ecosystems, identifying a few emerging research topics (e.g., aquatic omics' and high frequency monitoring). Many limnological investigations are linked to the concept of scientific monitoring, following a problem solving approach connected with the management of water resources. Experimental studies and modeling are restricted to specific niches. Overall, the scientific knowledge is quite scattered, showing hot-spots of specialized or integrated research in specific lakes and areas. The advancement of new knowledge in the LPL should rely on a better integration of scientific disciplines using multidisciplinary approaches, and on the continuous adoption of new advanced technologies and tools, contributing, besides basic research, to the next generation monitoring approaches. Finally, the preservation of LPL has to rely on water protection policies addressed towards the sustainable development of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, following the green and blue infrastructure concepts.

J	SHORTREED, KS; STOCKNER, JG				SHORTREED, KS; STOCKNER, JG			TROPHIC STATUS OF 19 SUB-ARCTIC LAKES IN THE YUKON TERRITORY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Limnological investigations were carried out on 19 Yukon River basin lakes in the summer of 1982 and on 10 of the lakes in March of 1983. Their surface areas ranged from 1.6 to 90 km2 and mean depths from 2.5 to 93 m. Regression analyses were carried out using various chemical and biological variables and results were compared with similar studies in other geographic areas. Based on range in total phosphorus concentrations (3.2 - 12.9 .mu.g/ .cntdot. L-1), average chlorophyll levels (0.62-3.76 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1), and average bacterioplankton numbers (7.8 .times. 105 to > 107 .cntdot. mL-1), most lakes were oligotrophic, several were mesotrophic, and one was close to eutrophy. Particulate concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon indicated that most lakes were predominantly phosphorus limited, but in a number, nitrogen was also important in limiting phytoplankton production. The picoplankter Synechococcus sp. was the most abundant phytoplankton species, and common zooplankters were Cyclops scutifer, Daphnia spp., and Diaptomus pribilofensis.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1986	43	4					797	805		10.1139/f86-098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-098													WOS:A1986A801900009

The federal designation of the endemic cui-ui sucker (Chasmistes cujus) as endangered prompted a restoration program in the 1980s aimed at increasing spring flows to permit fish spawning. These flows did promote cui-ui reproduction, as well as an unanticipated benefit, the extensive seedling recruitment of Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and sandbar willow (Salix exigua). Recruitment was scattered in 1983 but extensive in 1987, when the hydrograph satisfied the riparian recruitment box model that had been developed for other rivers. That model was subsequently applied to develop flow prescriptions that were implemented from 1995 through 2000 and enabled further seedling establishment. The woodland recovery produced broad ecosystem benefits, as evidenced by the return by 1998 of 10 of 19 riparian bird species whose populations had been locally extirpated or had declined severely between 1868 and 1980. The dramatic partial recovery along this severely degraded desert river offers promise that the use of instream flow regulation can promote ecosystem restoration along other dammed rivers worldwide.

J	Barber, MC				Barber, M. Craig			Dietary uptake models used for modeling the bioaccumulation of organic contaminants in fish	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Numerous models have been developed to predict the bioaccumulation of organic chemicals in fish. Although chemical dietary uptake can be modeled using assimilation efficiencies, bioaccumulation models fall into two distinct groups. The first group implicitly assumes that assimilation efficiencies describe the net chemical exchanges between fish and their food. These models describe chemical elimination as a lumped process that is independent of the fish's egestion rate or as a process that does not require an explicit fecal excretion term. The second group, however, explicitly assumes that assimilation efficiencies describe only actual chemical uptake and formulates chemical fecal and gill excretion as distinct, thermodynamically driven processes. After reviewing the derivations and assumptions of the algorithms that have been used to describe chemical dietary uptake of fish, their application, as implemented in 16 published bioaccumulation models, is analyzed for largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), walleye (Sander vitreus = Stizostedion vitreum), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that bioaccumulate an unspecified, poorly metabolized, hydrophobic chemical possessing a log K-OW of 6.5 (i.e., a chemical similar to a pentachlorobiphenyl).																			0730-7268	1552-8618				APR	2008	27	4					755	777		10.1897/07-462.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/07-462.1								18333698					WOS:000253950500001

Carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C(D)) Of a herbivorous zooplankter, Daphnia middendorfiana and several environmental variables were investigated during four annual production cycles (1988-92) in Smith Lake, Alaska to determine factors that affect the seasonal and interannual variability of delta(13)C(D). 2. delta(13)C(D) varied from -44.7 to -31.5 ppt and was significantly correlated with Chi a (r = 0.66, P = 0.0001), weakly correlated with CO2(aq) (r = 0.31, P = 0.07) and uncorrelated with delta(13)C(DIC) (r = 0.10, P = 0.70). Carbon isotope fractionation was minimal when Chi a appeared to be optimal. The largest C-13 fractionation was associated with the lowest Chi a during early and mid winter periods. 3. delta(13)CD was also significantly correlated with water temperature (r = 0.480, P = 0.0001) and photoperiod (r = 0.62, P = 0.0001), probably suggesting a critical role of physical forcing, particularly solar energy input, in affecting algal photosynthesis and delta(13)C(D) in this subarctic lake. 4. There was a large interannual variability of delta(13)C(D) among ice-cover periods which was partly explained by interwinter differences in the amount of snowfall that affected the flux of solar irradiance to the ice-covered lake. 5. Other explanations for delta(13)CD variability such as species succession, changes in algal cell size and differential use of CO2(aq) and HCO3- were also considered, but cannot account for the observations reported here.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	1999	42	3					417	426		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00472.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00472.x													WOS:000083843900002

Profitability Analysis of Cellulosic Energy Crops Compared with Corn	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												The expected profitability of six cellulosic feedstock crops is compared with two corn (Zea mays L.)-based systems under southern Great Lakes region conditions over a projected 10-yr period. At 2006-2009 costs and yields from literature, none would be more profitable than the corn-based systems. Comparative breakeven price analysis identifies the cellulosic feedstock price that would make crops equally profitable with continuous corn. Breakeven prices of cellulose are $110 to $130 Mg-1 for poplar (Populus spp.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and mixed grasses. For miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus J.M. Greef & Deuter ex Hodk. & Renvoize), breakeven cellulose prices are $200 Mg-1 at current costs, but only $45 Mg-1 if rhizome costs fall to near European levels, well within the range of temporary U.S. farm bill cost share levels for biomass harvest, transportation, and storage. Without targeted subsidies, native prairie and fallow old field systems would not be competitive with corn or the other four cellulosic crops reviewed at current yields and foreseeable prices. Comparative breakeven yields at a cellulose price of $60 Mg-1 would require yield gains above benchmark literature values of 50% for switchgrass, 60% for poplar and mixed grasses, 140% for fallow old fields, 180% for native prairie, and 190% for miscanthus at current rhizome costs, but no added yield for miscanthus with rhizomes at plausible reduced cost.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				MAR-APR	2010	102	2					675	687		10.2134/agronj2009.0289	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2009.0289													WOS:000276168300038
J	Perin, S; Lean, DRS; Pick, FR; Mazumder, A				Perin, S; Lean, DRS; Pick, FR; Mazumder, A			Photosynthetic carbon allocation: Effects of planktivorous fish and nutrient enrichment	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The proportions of lipid, polysaccharide and protein profoundly influence the nutritional value of food for planktonic organisms. Here, we investigated the effects of nutrients (N and P) and planktivorous fish (Phoxinus sp.) on the partitioning of photosynthetically fixed C-14-labelled bicarbonate into macromolecules (lipids, polysaccharides and proteins) and low molecular weight (LMW) metabolites of epilinmetic phytoplankton living in large (8 m diameter) enclosures from July to mid-October 1991. The enclosures were situated in an oligotrophic lake (north of Montreal, Canada) in both shallow (3.5 m) and deep (11 m) locations. The fractions were calculated using the sequential extraction of C-14-labeled phytoplankton samples incubated for short duration (similar to2 hours) at maximum photosynthetic rates. Labelling patterns of all end products exhibited great temporal variations. Overall, the LMW, polysaccharide, lipid and protein fractions accounted for 32.1 +/- 10.5%, 31.0 +/- 8.8%, 19.2 +/- 5.3% and 17.8 +/- 6.1% of the total C-14 fixed respectively. Percent C-14 in the LMW fraction was, in general, lower in the nutrient-enriched enclosure and was usually lower in the deep than the shallow enclosures. The effect of fish on the labelling pattern of LMW varied throughout the sampling period but, overall, its impact was non-significant. The proportions of C-14 into lipids and polysaccharides did not show the expected increase under nutrient deficiency. In contrast, the polysaccharide fraction increased, for the most part, with nutrient enrichment and was higher in the deep than the shallow enclosures with little changes in the presence of planktivorous fish. Incorporation of C-14 into lipids remained relatively uniform throughout the study and averaged less than 20% of total fixed carbon. Nutrient addition increased the lipid fraction in early July but did not have a significant effect thereafter. In general, the presence of planktivorous fish decreased the lipid fraction especially in the deep N+F enclosures. With nutrient enrichment, the proportion of C-14 incorporated into protein decreased in the shallow enclosures while it increased in the deep enclosures. During most of the study, there was no significant effect of fish on the distribution pattern of protein. Percent carbon protein averaged 20% of total carbon fixed during the summer and decreased to 10% in October with lower water temperatures. Any fish effects encountered throughout this study were probably mediated indirectly through changes in the species and cell size compositions of phytoplankton. An experiment where samples were incubated with depth (0.5 to 7 m) showed that, for all treatments, the protein fraction increased with depth at the expense of lipid and LMW metabolites syntheses. The polysaccharide fraction demonstrated no apparent relationships with depth. These changes with depth most likely reflect light attenuation rather than a decrease in temperature. Overall, our findings would suggest that the distribution patterns of photosynthetically incorporated carbon into LMW compounds and macromolecules in natural phytoplankton communities are controlled by a combination of both abiotic (e. g., nutrients, light and temperature) and biotic (species and cell size) environmental factors and the interactions between these factors will in essence influence the direction of carbon flow and the food quality of the phytoplankton. These observations are placed in context with a review of the literature on carbon allocation by natural populations of phyt					Pick, Frances/AAD-6379-2021; Pick, Frances/P-2473-2017	Pick, Frances/0000-0002-5486-4061													1015-1621						2002	64	3					217	238		10.1007/s00027-002-8069-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-002-8069-6													WOS:000179471200001

Movement, home range, and structural habitat use of the Largemouth Bass complex in two large Texas reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective: Angler complaints regarding perceived declines in angling quality prompted research to examine the home range, movement, water depth use, and structural habitat use and selection of the Largemouth Bass complex (LBC; Largemouth Bass Micropterus nigricans, Florida Bass M. salmoides, and Largemouth Bass x Florida Bass hybrids) in Toledo Bend and Lake Fork reservoirs, Texas. Methods: A total of 21 LBC individuals at Toledo Bend Reservoir (386-604 mm total length [TL]) and 22 LBC fish at Lake Fork Reservoir (364-545 mm TL) were implanted with radio transmitters and tracked over a 2-year period. Result: At both reservoirs, LBC home range areas were small (<50 ha) and overall movement was low (similar to 40-100 m/week). Fish primarily occupied water column depths of less than 2 m in both reservoirs and were found in the shallowest depths during the spring. Although overall structural habitat occurrence and selection of LBC fish varied between reservoirs, primarily due to differences at shorelines and creeks (two times higher in Toledo Bend Reservoir) and drops (three times higher in Lake Fork Reservoir), fish selected for the shoreline, drops, points, and creeks in both reservoirs, while drains and flats reflected avoidance. Seasonally, habitat occurrence of LBC fish varied at Toledo Bend Reservoir, primarily due to differences in shoreline use, and flats had the highest fish occurrences during all seasons. At Lake Fork Reservoir, LBC occurrences at flats and drops were high and similar during all seasons. Conclusion: Our estimates of small LBC home ranges and low movement in these large reservoirs were generally similar to those reported in previous studies, regardless of reservoir size. Fish preferred structural habitat types with abrupt slopes, were primarily located offshore, and occupied water column depths that are commonly targeted by LBC anglers.

Echosounding observations were made along 27 transect lines spaced at 500-m intervals on August 4 and September 2 and 30, 2003. Quantitative vegetation data including percent coverage, mean vegetation height, and percent vegetation infestation were directly determined using image data from the echosounder recorded digitally on videotape. Based on the image data from an echosounder, a regression model was developed for estimating biomass of submerged macrophytes. The regression model using the total echo strength as the explanatory variable could reliably estimate macrophyte biomass up to 300 g m(-2). Distribution maps of macrophyte height and biomass suggest that the recent summer decline of submerged macrophytes started earlier in shallow areas (< 3 m of depth) than deep areas (> 4 m) in the southern basin of Lake Biwa.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2007	8	2					95	102		10.1007/s10201-006-0200-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-006-0200-2													WOS:000248820400002

The topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva Schlegel, 1842, a south-east asian cyprinid, was introduced accidentally in the Danube Delta in Romania in the 1960s and has now achieved a pan-Danubian distribution. P. parva has been introduced into other countries, such as Greece, usually inadvertently included with other species imported for fish farming. In 1984-85, during a study of the fish populations of Lake Mikri Prespa (north-west Greece), several topmouth gudgeon were caught. Our aim was to study the changes in the population size of P. parva over nearly 10 years, to study its life history traits and to assess its potential impacts on native fish species. 2. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) in spring increased significantly between 1984 and 1992. We found evidence that P. parva has established a breeding population in the lake. P. parva combines many characteristics likely to favour a successful colonization (resistance to harsh climatic conditions, early sexual maturity, extended breeding season, broad dietary spectrum). Growth in Lake Prespa, where the oldest individuals captured were 3 years old, is very similar to that observed within its native range. 3. There is evidence for dietary overlap between P. parva and three endemic species: Paraphoxinus epiroticus prespensis, Cobitis meridionalis and Alburnoides bipunctalus ohridanus. No decline in the populations of these three species has yet been demonstrated. Other possible impacts are discussed. The successful colonization by P. parva was certainly favoured by the absence of a true piscivorous fish in the lake and by the isolation and high level of endemism of fish communities. 4. The conservation of the many endemic species in the lake should be a priority and the introduction of exotic species should be banned.																			1052-7613					SEP	1993	3	3					223	231		10.1002/aqc.3270030306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3270030306													WOS:A1993MD98600004

Aeration Zone in Karst - Properties and Investigations	ADVANCES IN RESEARCH IN KARST MEDIA	Environmental Earth Sciences-Series				4th International Symposium on Karst	APR 27-30, 2010	Malaga, SPAIN	Univ Malaga, Ctr Hydrogeol, Spanish Geolog Survey, UNESCO, Int Hydrolog Programme, Inst Geologico Minero Espana				Aeration, vadose or unsaturated zone in karst aquifer is the zone above the water table (the zone between land surface and piezometric level measured in stand pipe piezometers). This zone can be divided into two sections: an upper section permanently water free and a deeper section temporarily saturated by water. During dry periods, the deeper section is temporarily an aeration zone; however, during the rainy season it is the most dynamic part of the karst aquifer. Within this section, there exist karst channels, caverns, underground flows with free surface (underground rivers), and underground siphonal lakes. An aeration zone plays an important role during the construction of dams, reservoirs and tunnels in karst and can cause various kinds of problems. A particular problem appears if the dam sites and reservoirs are located above the aeration zone or when tunnels cross huge empty caverns or temporarily saturated aeration zones. Due to an abrupt rising of the water table the pressure of air trapped in the karst channels and siphons significantly increase. As consequence, the water tightness of the reservoir bottom can be endangered. The induced seismicity, also, has been documented at the vicinity of some large temporary springs. Some common investigation methods in karst are not successful in the case of aeration zone. The most effective methods in karst as groundwater level monitoring and tracer tests are not useful. Speleology is the most common method but only if karst channels are accessible. TV logging was successfully applied at different locations. Experiments with smoke and ear as tracers also provided good results. Some of those methods are presented in this article.																			2199-9155		978-3-642-12485-3				2010							423	428		10.1007/978-3-642-12486-0_65	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12486-0_65													WOS:000395214400065

Five study areas in the archipelago zone were surveyed with multimesh gill nets in summer 1998. Our results confirmed that salinity is an important factor influencing species richness in the northern coastal waters of the Gulf of Finland, as marine species gradually disappeared towards the less haline eastern areas. However, the conventional indicators of eutrophication derived from lakes (high total catches, high catches of cyprinids) did not show logical differences between more and less eutrophic coastal areas. The higher productivity in the eastern part of the gulf has not led to higher fish biomasses in the archipelago zone. A potential factor affecting fish communities seems to be the high fishing pressure in some coastal areas.																			1434-2944						2000	85	5-6					687	696		10.1002/1522-2632(200011)85:5/6<687::AID-IROH687>3.0.CO;2-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1522-2632(200011)85:5/6<687::AID-IROH687>3.0.CO;2-4													WOS:000165921100014

Exploring the interplay between soil thermal and hydrological changes and their impact on carbon fluxes in permafrost ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Accelerated warming of the Arctic can affect the global climate system by thawing permafrost and exposing organic carbon in soils to decompose and release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We used a process-based biosphere model (DVM-DOS-TEM) designed to simulate biophysical and biogeochemical interactions between the soil, vegetation, and atmosphere. We varied soil and environmental parameters to assess the impact on cryohydrological and biogeochemical outputs in the model. We analyzed the responses of ecosystem carbon balances to permafrost thaw by running site-level simulations at two long-term tundra ecological monitoring sites in Alaska: Eight Mile Lake (EML) and Imnavait Creek Watershed (IMN), which are characterized by similar tussock tundra vegetation but differing soil drainage conditions and climate. Model outputs showed agreement with field observations at both sites for soil physical properties and ecosystem CO2 fluxes. Model simulations of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) showed an overestimation during the frozen season (higher CO2 emissions) at EML with a mean NEE of 26.98 +/- 4.83 gC/m2/month compared to observational mean of 22.01 +/- 5.67 gC/m2/month, and during the fall months at IMN, with a modeled mean of 19.21 +/- 7.49 gC/m2/month compared to observation mean of 11.9 +/- 4.45 gC/m2/month. Our results underscore the importance of representing the impact of soil drainage conditions on the thawing of permafrost soils, particularly poorly drained soils, which will drive the magnitude of carbon released at sites across the high-latitude tundra. These findings can help improve predictions of net carbon releases from thawing permafrost, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the impact of Arctic warming on the global climate system.					; JAFAROV, ELCHIN/G-1616-2016; Genet, Helene/D-5836-2018; Jafarov, Elchin/G-1616-2016; Schuur, Edward/ACG-9944-2022	Rogers, Brendan/0000-0001-6711-8466; Schuur, Edward/0000-0002-1096-2436; JAFAROV, ELCHIN/0000-0002-8310-3261; Genet, Helene/0000-0003-4537-9563; Clein, Joy/0000-0002-2816-5312; Rutter, Ruth/0009-0009-7043-6081													1748-9326					JUL 1	2024	19	7							074003	10.1088/1748-9326/ad50ed	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad50ed													WOS:001250221900001

Gary			Long-term effects of temperature during early life on growth and fatty acid metabolism in age-0 Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY												Environmental temperature during early life may have prolonged effects on growth and fatty acid metabolism, which could strongly influence overwintering survival in the first year of life for temperate-zone fish. In the present study, we examined how temperature during early life history might influence growth performance and fatty acid metabolism in age-0 Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) when exposed to cold temperatures at later stages. Fish were initially at 16 degrees C and subsequently held at 16 degrees C or 20 degrees C for 60 days beginning at 34 days post fertilization (dpf). Then, all fish were subsequently raised at the same temperature of 16 degrees C until the onset of cold conditioning at 158 dpf where temperature was gradually decreased to 3.5 degrees C and remained there for two weeks. Samples were collected before (151 dpf) and after cold conditioning (199 dpf) to measure total length, body mass, whole body metabolic rate, fatty acid profile in phospholipids and triglycerides and mRNA expression of genes associated with fatty acid desaturation, elongation and beta-oxidation. Results revealed that before cold conditioning, total length and body mass did not differ between temperature groups, but fish raised at 20 degrees C showed a lower condition factor. During the cold conditioning, only fish raised at 16 degrees C grew significantly longer and heavier. There was no difference in metabolic rates between treatments. Significant increases in total monounsaturated fatty acids with decreases in total saturated fatty acids were identified in phospholipids and triglycerides in both temperature groups after the cold conditioning; however, the 20 degrees C group did not significantly increase levels of gene expression associated with fatty acid desaturation (SCD and FADS1) whereas the 16 degrees C group did. Our results suggest that thermal experience during early life may influence overwintering survival of age-0 Lake Sturgeon.					; Yoon, Gwangseok/AAH-4714-2021	Yoon, Gwangseok/0000-0001-5557-8692; Anderson, W.

The area of study corresponds to a 100 km 3 180 km rectangle, located on the Brazil-Paraguay border, with Itaipu Lake in its center. The characteristics of the lake breeze generated by the numerical experiments were consistent with the observations available in the area. The numerical experiments have shown that the land use effect is important in the spatial distribution of the lake- breeze circulation and that the topography contributes to modulating the breeze intensity, with the daytime valley-mountain circulation intensifying the lake breeze. However, the circulation pattern observed during daytime over the region is mainly due to the Itaipu Lake presence. The numerical results indicated that Itaipu Lake is able to generate and sustain a lake breeze, with 3.5 m s(-1) of maximum intensity and 1500-m depth, that propagates inland at 5.1 km h(-1) under typical undisturbed and calm-wind summer conditions.

In this paper, we present new data and evaluate the biomass, C, N, and P content of various types of vegetation, and the water catchment of an oligotrophic lake sited at Byers Peninsula, Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands. As the main results show, the total amount of C, N, and P contained in the organisms of the watershed is 144, 0.71 and 0.018 g m(-2), respectively. According to element contents, 98% of the biological C from the watershed is within mosses and microbial mats structures (79.1 and 19.0% respectively). Also, 98.7% of the N is partially distributed between moss carpets, microbial mats and lichens, 55.2, 43.5, and 3.37 x 10(-7)% respectively. On the other hand, 90.2% of P is within moss carpets structures. Nutrient pools in the communities of Limnopolar Lake itself are a minor component of the whole catchment.

J	Kolath, AS; Egemose, S				Kolath, Anja Svane; Egemose, Sara			Influences of Urban Discharges and Urban Heat Effects on Stream Temperature	HYDROLOGY												Urban areas with dark and impermeable surfaces are known to have a heating effect on air and still water compared to surrounding areas, called the urban heat island effect (UHI). UHI and stormwater discharges' collective impact on stream temperature, especially regarding seasonal changes, is a less-studied field. In this study, the temperature effect of the urban village Aarslev on Stream Vindinge in Southern Denmark was examined. Loggers (ID A-L) were placed in Stream Vindinge in 2020-2021, measuring temperature (degrees C) and pressure (kPa). Outlets were analyzed with respect to origin: Direct stormwater outlets (rain divided by basin), stormwater delayed by ponds (rain + basin), common overflow, and common sewage from WWTP. Data showed the stream temperature rise through Aarslev village in all months (except March) with 0.3-1.9 degrees C, most notably in the summer months. A one-way ANOVA confirmed that the upstream station A and downstream station K were significantly different (p-values < 0.001). No significant difference in temperatures between the different outlet types was found. An increase in stream temperature was observed in response to rain events, followed by a temperature decrease. This was assumed to be a "first heat flush". This was speculated to mean less optimal conditions for trout and sensitive macroinvertebrates not because of heat shock, but rather to lower O-2 concentrations and higher mineralization. River and lake temperatures are projected to increase, and this effect might become more pronounced. A decrease in stream temperature was observed after the village (station L). Therefore, it was concluded that the rise in temperature through the village was due to UHI.

In this study, the main environmental factors and sediment microbial communities were investigated bimonthly from August 2018 to June 2020 at River Taizicheng, a shallow temperate mountain river at the core area of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Microbial community structure was analyzed using 16S rRNA genes (bacteria 16S V3 + V4 and archaea 16S V4 + V5) and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Structure equation model (SEM) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to explore the driving environmental factors of the microbial community. Our results showed that the diversity indices of the microbial community were positively influenced by sediment nutrients but negatively affected by water nutrients. Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were the most dominant phyla. The best-fitted SEM model indicated that environmental variables not only affected community abundance directly, but also indirectly through influencing their diversity. Flavobacterium, Arenimonas and Terrimonas were the dominant genera as a result of enriched nutrients. The microbial community had high spatial-temporal autocorrelation. CCA showed that DO, WT and various forms of phosphorus were the main variables affecting the temporal and spatial patterns of the microbial community in the river. The results will be helpful in understanding the driving factors of microbial communities in temperate monsoon areas.

Phylogeny and physiology of candidate phylum 'Atribacteria' (OP9/JS1) inferred from cultivation-independent genomics	ISME JOURNAL												The 'Atribacteria' is a candidate phylum in the Bacteria recently proposed to include members of the OP9 and JS1 lineages. OP9 and JS1 are globally distributed, and in some cases abundant, in anaerobic marine sediments, geothermal environments, anaerobic digesters and reactors and petroleum reservoirs. However, the monophyly of OP9 and JS1 has been questioned and their physiology and ecology remain largely enigmatic due to a lack of cultivated representatives. Here cultivation-independent genomic approaches were used to provide a first comprehensive view of the phylogeny, conserved genomic features and metabolic potential of members of this ubiquitous candidate phylum. Previously available and heretofore unpublished OP9 and JS1 single-cell genomic data sets were used as recruitment platforms for the reconstruction of atribacterial metagenome bins from a terephthalate-degrading reactor biofilm and from the monimolimnion of meromictic Sakinaw Lake. The single-cell genomes and metagenome bins together comprise six species-to genus-level groups that represent most major lineages within OP9 and JS1. Phylogenomic analyses of these combined data sets confirmed the monophyly of the 'Atribacteria' inclusive of OP9 and JS1. Additional conserved features within the 'Atribacteria' were identified, including a gene cluster encoding putative bacterial microcompartments that may be involved in aldehyde and sugar metabolism, energy conservation and carbon storage. Comparative analysis of the metabolic potential inferred from these data sets revealed that members of the 'Atribacteria' are likely to be heterotrophic anaerobes that lack respiratory capacity, with some lineages predicted to specialize in either primary fermentation of carbohydrates or secondary fermentation of organic acids, such as propionate.

J	Tang, QH; Peng, L; Yang, Y; Lin, QQ; Qian, SS; Han, BP				Tang, Quehui; Peng, Liang; Yang, Yang; Lin, Qiuqi; Qian, Song S.; Han, Bo-Ping			Total phosphorus-precipitation and Chlorophyll a-phosphorus relationships of lakes and reservoirs mediated by soil iron at regional scale	WATER RESEARCH												Phosphorus is a critical element determining trophic status and Chlorophyll a (Chl a) level in natural lakes and reservoirs, and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations can be predicted from data on phosphorus loading, hydraulic flushing rate and sedimentation. Due to their interactions with phosphorus, iron (hydr) oxides in suspended particles, originally derived from watershed soil, can strongly influence the phosphorus sedimentation and phosphorus bioavailability in water columns. Thus, the TP-precipitation relationship and the response of Chl a to TP are likely associated with watersheds soil iron. To test this assumption, we built hierarchical linear models for summer observation of natural lakes and reservoirs across a large geographic gradient. The intercepts and slopes of TP-precipitation relationships are higher in natural lakes than those in reservoirs, and these model coefficients exhibit latitudinal variations that are explained by the natural soil iron gradient. Soil iron, operating at a regional level, significantly mediates the effect of precipitation on TP concentration in both natural lakes and reservoirs, and drives the latitudinal variation in the Chl a-TP relationships for reservoirs. Our results imply that the increase in extreme precipitation events anticipated under future climate conditions may substantially mitigate eutrophication in tropical and subtropical reservoirs, but may worsen conditions in temperate lakes.
