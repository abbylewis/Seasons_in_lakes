Cold-season temperatures in the European Alps during the past millennium: variability, seasonality and recent trends	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This study presents a proxy-based, quantitative reconstruction of cold-season (mean October to May, Toct-May) air temperatures covering nearly the entire last millennium (AD 1060-2003, some hiatuses). The reconstruction was based on subfossil chrysophyte stomatocyst remains in the varved sediments of high-Alpine Lake Silvaplana, eastern Swiss Alps (46 degrees 27'N, 9 degrees 48'W, 1791 m a.s.I.). Previous studies have demonstrated the reliability of this proxy by comparison to meteorological data. Cold-season air temperatures could therefore be reconstructed quantitatively, at a high resolution (5-yr) and with high chronological accuracy. Spatial correlation analysis suggests that the reconstruction reflects cold season climate variability over the high- Alpine region and substantial parts of central and western Europe. Cold-season temperatures were characterized by a relatively stable first part of the millennium until AD 1440 (2 sigma of 5-yr mean values = 0.7 degrees C) and highly variable TOct-May after that (AD 1440-1900, 2 sigma of 5-yr mean values = 1.3 degrees C). Recent decades (AD, 1991-present) were unusually warm in the context of the last millennium (exceeding the 2 sigma-range of the mean decadal TOct-May) but this warmth was not unprecedented. The coolest decades occurred from AD 1510-1520 and AD 1880-1890. The timing of extremely warm and cold decades is generally in good agreement with documentary data representing Switzerland and central European lowlands. The transition from relatively stable to highly variable TOct-May coincided with large changes in atmospheric circulation patterns in the North Atlantic region. Comparison of reconstructed cold season temperatures to the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) during the past 1000 years showed that the relatively stable and warm conditions at the study site until AD 1440 coincided with a persistent positive mode of the NAO. We propose that the transition to large TOct-May variability around AD 1440 was linked to the subsequent absence of this persistent zonal flow pattern, which would allow other climatic drivers to gain importance in the study area. From AD 1440-1900, the similarity of reconstructed TOct-May to reconstructed air pressure in the Siberian High suggests a relatively strong influence of continental anticyclonic systems on Alpine cold season climate parameters during periods when westerly airflow was subdued. A more continental type of atmospheric circulation thus seems to be characteristic for the Little Ice Age in Europe. Comparison of Toct-May to summer temperature reconstructions from the same study site shows that, as expected, summer and cold season temperature trends and variability differed completely throughout nearly the entire last 1000 years. Since AD 1980, however, summer and cold season temperatures show a simultaneous, strong increase, which is unprecedented in the context of the last millennium. We suggest that the most likely explanation for this recent trend is anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Towfiqul			Bioaccumulation and sources of metal(loid)s in fish species from a subtropical river in Bangladesh: a public health concern	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Toxic metals and freshwater fish's metalloid contamination are significant environmental concerns for overall public health. However, the bioaccumulation and sources of metal(loids) in freshwater fishes from Bangladesh still remain unknown. Thus, the As, Pb, Cd, and Cr concentrations in various freshwater fish species from the Rupsha River basin were measured, including Tenualosa ilisha, Gudusia chapra, Otolithoides pama, Setipinna phasa, Mystus vittatus, Glossogobius giuris, and Pseudeutropius atherinoides. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine metal concentrations. The mean concentrations of metal(loids) in the fish muscle (mg/kg) were found to be As (1.53) > Pb (1.25) > Cr (0.51) > Cd (0.39) in summer and As (1.72) > Pb (1.51) > Cr (0.65) > Cd (0.49) in winter. The analyzed fish species had considerably different metal(loid) concentrations with seasonal variation, and the distribution of the metals (loids) was consistent with the normal distribution. The demersal species, M. vittatus, displayed the highest bio-accumulative value over the summer. However, in both seasons, none of the species were bio-accumulative. According to multivariate statistical findings, the research area's potential sources of metal(loid) were anthropogenic activities linked to geogenic processes. Estimated daily intake, target hazard quotient (THQ), and carcinogenic risk (CR) were used to assess the influence of the risk on human health. The consumers' THQs values were < 1, indicating that there were no non-carcinogenic concerns for local consumers. Both categories of customers had CRs that fell below the permissible range of 1E - 6 to 1E - 4, meaning they were not at any increased risk of developing cancer. The children's group was more vulnerable to both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic hazards. Therefore, the entry of metal(loids) must be regulated, and appropriate laws must be used by policymakers.					Islam, Saiful/AAV-9698-2020; Islam, Abu Reza Md. Towfiqul/O-8554-2019; Siddique, Md.

Behavioral responses to annual temperature variation alter the dominant energy pathway, growth, and condition of a cold-water predator	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												There is a pressing need to understand how ecosystems will respond to climate change. To date, no long-term empirical studies have confirmed that fish populations exhibit adaptive foraging behavior in response to temperature variation and the potential implications this has on fitness. Here, we use an unparalleled 11-y acoustic telemetry, stable isotope, and mark-recapture dataset to test if a population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-water stenotherm, adjusted its use of habitat and energy sources in response to annual variations in lake temperatures during the open-water season and how these changes translated to the growth and condition of individual fish. We found that climate influenced access to littoral regions in spring (data from telemetry), which in turn influenced energy acquisition (data from isotopes), and growth (mark-recapture data). In more stressful years, those with shorter springs and longer summers, lake trout had reduced access to littoral habitat and assimilated less littoral energy, resulting in reduced growth and condition. Annual variation in prey abundance influenced lake trout foraging tactics (i.e., the balance of the number and duration of forays) but not the overall time spent in littoral regions. Lake trout greatly reduced their use of littoral habitat and occupied deep pelagic waters during the summer. Together, our results provide clear evidence that climate-mediated behavior can influence the dominant energy pathways of top predators, with implications ranging from individual fitness to food web stability.

AQUATIC SCIENCES												Kettle holes are small inland waters formed from glacially-created depressions often situated in agricultural landscapes. Due to their high perimeter-to-area ratio facilitating a high aquatic-terrestrial coupling, kettle holes can accumulate high concentrations of organic carbon and nutrients, fueling microbial activities and turnover rates. Thus, they represent hotspots of carbon turnover in the landscape, but their bacterial activities and controlling factors have not been well investigated. Therefore, we aimed to assess the relative importance of various environmental factors on bacterial and biogeochemical processes in the water column of kettle holes and to disentangle their variations. In the water body of ten kettle holes in north-eastern Germany, we measured several physico-chemical and biological parameters such as carbon quantity and quality, as well as bacterial protein production (BP) and community respiration (CR) in spring, early summer and autumn 2014. Particulate organic matter served as an indicator of autochthonous production and represented an important parameter to explain variations in BP and CR. This notion is supported by qualitative absorbance indices of dissolved molecules in water samples and C: N ratios of the sediments, which demonstrate high fractions of autochthonous organic matter (OM) in the studied kettle holes. In contrast, dissolved chemical parameters were less important for bacterial activities although they revealed strong differences throughout the growing season. Pelagic bacterial activities and dynamics might thus be regulated by autochthonous OM in kettle holes implying a control of important biogeochemical processes by internal primary production rather than facilitated exchange with the terrestrial surrounding due to a high perimeter-to-area ratio.

J	Karlsson, J; Jonsson, A; Jansson, M				Karlsson, J; Jonsson, A; Jansson, M			Bacterioplankton production in lakes along an altitude gradient in the subarctic north of Sweden	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We examined changes in bacterioplankton standing stock and production in subarctic lakes in the north of Sweden to elucidate their coupling to lake physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Sixteen lakes situated along an altitude gradient extending from the coniferous forest to the high-alpine belt were studied during 1998 and 1999. The summer mean bacterial numbers and production varied substantially between the lakes, with a general trend toward decreasing values with increasing altitude. The results demonstrate that P probably restricted bacterial utilization of DOC in the coniferous forest lakes, while low DOC concentrations limited bacterial growth during the summer in the alpine lakes. The primary production of plankton was insufficient to support bacterial production in the lakes. High input of allochthonous DOC to the alpine lakes in spring was sufficient both to increase the bacterial production and to induce P-limitation. As a consequence, there was a tendency toward higher bacterial activity in the spring compared to the summer in the alpine lakes. The results indicate that most of the bacterial standing stock and production are supported by allochthonous DOC plus DOC from benthic production, and more or less limited by the phosphorus supply. We therefore suggest that bacteria populations in subarctic lakes may be indirectly affected by climate variations through its impact on the input of DOC and nutrients from the lake catchments.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				OCT	2001	42	3					372	382		10.1007/s00248-001-0009-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-001-0009-9								12024262					WOS:000171961000016

However, the distribution of comammox bacteria in various habitats and their potential environmental drivers remain poorly understood. Using qPCR and high-throughput sequencing approach, we analyzed the abundance and community patterns of comammox from 38 samples taken from five different habitat types including paddy fields in Shaoguan and Antu, the wheat fields, river, and grassland in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the fringe and central riparian zones of Chaohu Lake of China during winter and summer. Comammox bacteria were detected in all samples, with Ca. N. nitrificans dominating the community, followed by Ca. N. nitrosa. Generally, in paddy fields of Shaoguan and Antu, ammonia (NH4+) was the key factor affecting comammox bacteria. However, in wheat fields, river and grassland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, altitude was the strongest factor affecting comammox bacteria. In Chaohu Lake, comammox bacteria showed temporal heterogeneity, being higher in winter than summer, especially in the fringe riparian zone. Our results suggest that comammox is widespread in diverse habitats and exhibit niche partitioning, and can be affected by different environmental factors that may vary by habitat.

Monthly rates of mineralization and nitrification measured by the buried bag technique, soil C/N ratios, and the contribution of microbial NO3- to total NO3- in the groundwater as determined by analysis of delta(18)O in NO3- are also similar. In both catchments, maximum NO3- export occurs during spring melt, but in the catchment with higher export, NO3- concentrations in the stream begin to increase in the fall period. Groundwater NO3- concentrations measured in wells are very different in the two catchments with high groundwater NO3- in the catchment exhibiting high NO3- export. Following spring melt, steeper slopes in the high NO3- catchment promote faster drainage, and the water table declines rapidly while high NO3- concentrations are maintained in groundwaters. Deeper water tables will preserve high NO3- in water infiltrating below the rooting zone and organic-rich upper soil horizons. In the low NO3- catchment, slower drainage on shallower slopes lead to an increase in soil saturation, and the NO3- disappears from the water before the water table declines. Analyses of delta(15)N in NO3- during NO3- loss do not show evidence of denitrification, although denitrification proceeding to completion in isolated pockets followed by mixing with higher NO3- groundwaters would yield the same result. Alternatively, active uptake of NO3- by vegetation following spring melt will also deplete the groundwater NO3- in the shallow soil depths without isotopic fractionation. The low NO3- catchment also has lower NO3- in shallow soil waters during spring melt. Shallower slopes promote near-surface flow paths in organic-rich soil horizons which may facilitate denitrification during spring melt. Although the catchment with low NO3- export has a large wetland near the catchment outlet, the NO3- attenuating capacity of this wetland is largely unused except in the late fall because growing season groundwater concentrations of NO3- are undetectable and the wetland is frozen during snowmelt. In the high NO3- catchment, organic-rich soils and vegetation in the riparian zone cannot completely attenuate high NO3- in discharging groundwaters. In our study, factors controlling NO3- in groundwater such as slope, stratigraphy, and hydraulic conductivity can play a larger role than riparian zones in controlling differences in annual NO3- export observed between catchments.

Water temperature, pH, conductivity, and phytoplankton were closely related to rotifer vertical distribution, while dissolved oxygen had no relationship with the vertical distribution of rotifers. The species composition and population density of rotifers changed significantly between seasons. However, rotifer vertical distributions in both seasons were similar. They aggregated at specific depths in the water column. All the rotifer species inhabited the surface layers (0.5-5 m). Generally, the rotifers did not display DVM except for Polyarthra vulgaris (in summer), which performed reverse migration. The reason that rotifers did not perform DVM may be explained by the low abundance of competitors and predators and the high density of food resources at the surface strata.

Role of the polychaete Neanthes succinea in phosphorus regeneration from sediments in the Salton Sea, California	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Salton Sea currently suffers from several well-documented water quality problems associated with high nutrient loading. However, the importance of phosphorus regeneration from sediments has not been established. Sediment phosphorus regeneration rates may be affected by benthic macroinvertebrate activity (e.g. bioturbation and excretion). The polychaete Neanthes succinea (Frey and Leuckart) is the dominant benthic macroinvertebrate in the Salton Sea. It is widely distributed during periods of mixing (winter and spring), and inhabits only shallow water areas following development of anoxia in summer. The contribution of N. succinea to sediment phosphorus regeneration was investigated using laboratory incubations of cores under lake temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations typical of the Salton Sea. Regeneration rates of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were lowest (-0.23-1.03 mg P m(-2) day(-1)) under saturated oxygen conditions, and highest (1.23-4.67 mg P m(-2) day(-1)) under reduced oxygen levels. N. succinea most likely stimulated phosphorus regeneration under reduced oxygen levels via increased burrow ventilation rates. Phosphorus excretion rates by N. succinea were 60-70% more rapid under reduced oxygen levels than under saturated or hypoxic conditions. SRP accounted for 71-80% of the dissolved phosphorus excreted under all conditions. Whole-lake SRP regeneration rates predicted from N. succinea biomass densities are highest in early spring, when the lake is mixing frequently and mid-lake phytoplankton populations are maximal. Thus, any additional phosphorus regenerated from the sediments at that time has potential for contributing to the overall production of the lake.

The isotopic composition of precipitation has long been considered as a good tracer to investigate moisture recycling. This study quantifies the moisture recycling fractions (f(r)) in the Lake Taihu region using spatial variations of deuterium excess in precipitation (d(P)) and surface water vapour flux (d(E)). Results show that d(P) at a site downwind of the lake was higher than that at an upwind site, indicating the influence of lake moisture recycling. Spatial variations in d(P) after sub-cloud evaporation corrections were 2.3, 1.4 and 3.2 parts per thousand, and d(E) values were 27.4, 32.3 and 31.4 parts per thousand for the first winter monsoon, the summer monsoon and the second winter monsoon, respectively. Moisture recycling fractions were 0.48 +/- 0.13, 0.07 +/- 0.03 and 0.38 +/- 0.05 for the three monsoon periods, respectively. Both using the lake parameterization kinetic fractionation factors or neglecting sub-cloud evaporation would decrease f(r), and the former has a larger influence on the f(r) calculation. The larger f(r) in the winter monsoon periods was mainly caused by lower specific humidity of airmasses but comparable moisture uptake along their trajectories compared to the summer monsoon period.

J	UNGER, PA; BRANDT, SB				UNGER, PA; BRANDT, SB			SEASONAL AND DIEL CHANGES IN SAMPLING CONDITIONS FOR ACOUSTIC SURVEYS OF FISH ABUNDANCE IN SMALL LAKES	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Acoustic techniques have difficulty detecting fish that are near the surface or near the bottom. This limitation may be particularly critical in small, shallow lakes where the pelagic zone is relatively small. The feasibility of acoustic sampling was tested in 9 small lakes (5-52 ha) in the Adirondack region (New York) [USA] and northern Wisconsin during summer and autumn 1985. We report here on the effects of seasonal and diel changes in the distributions of fish and the dipteran, Chaoborus, on acoustic measures of abundance. Fish abundances were measured using echo integration of signals from echo sounders operating at three frequencies (70, 120 and 420 kHz). Fish distributions were compared with water temperatures, dissolved oxygen concentrations and water depth. During summer stratification in the lakes, fish were concentrated in the metalimnion. Water temperatures at the depths occupied by the fish matched their reported thermal preferences in some, but not all, lakes. Fish density was highest immediately above the anoxic hypolimnion. Mid-water aggregation by the fish in the metalimnion produced good conditions for acoustic sampling. Following autumn overturn, fish distributions were generally not favourable for acoustic sampling because fish moved to shallow water or to the bottom. Acoustic scattering in the lakes was often much stronger at night than during the day, owing largely to Chaoborus larvae, which vertically migrate from the sediments at night. When Chaoborus was abundant, acoustic detection of fish at night was difficult. Acoustic techniques proved useful in small lakes, but distributions of fish and plankton can affect data reliability and must therefore be examined carefully. Seasonal and diel variations in fish and plankton distributions are somewhat predictable and can be used to develop more efficient strategies for acoustic sampling.																			0165-7836	1872-6763				JUN	1989	7	4					353	366		10.1016/0165-7836(89)90067-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(89)90067-2													WOS:A1989AF70600004

The ice cover of this lake had been thinning steadily at a rate exceeding 20 cm yr-1 during the last decade but seems to have recently stabilized at a thickness of 3.3 m. Data concerning lake level and degree-days above freezing are presented to show the relationship between peak summer temperatures and the volume of glacier-derived meltwater entering Lake Hoare each summer. From these latter data we infer that peak summer temperatures have been above 0-degrees-C for a progressively longer period of time each year since 1972. We also consider possible explanations for the thinning of the lake ice. The thickness of the ice cover is determined by the balance between freezing during the winter and ablation that occurs all year but maximizes in summer. We suggest that the term most likely responsible for the change in the ice cover thickness at Lake Hoare is the extent of summer melting, consistent with the rising lake levels.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013	Andersen, Dale/0000-0001-8827-1259; McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362													2169-9275	2169-9291				MAR 15	1992	97	C3					3503	3513		10.1029/91JC03106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC03106								11538388					WOS:A1992HJ48800003

Significant losses of nitrate-nitrogen (NO(3)-N) could occur after heavy N fertilization under open-field conditions combined with high precipitation in the summer. It is urgently needed to improve N management under the wide spread greenhouse vegetable production system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a summer catch crop and reduced N application rates on N leaching and vegetable crop yields. During a 2-year period, sweet corn as an N catch crop was planted between vegetable crops in the summer season under 5 N fertilizer treatments (0, 348, 522, 696, and 870 kg ha(-1)) in greenhouse vegetable production systems in Tai Lake region, southern China. A water collection system was installed at a depth of 0.5 m in the soil to collect leachates during the vegetable growing season. The sweet corn as a catch crop reduced the total N concentration from 94 to 59 mg l(-1) in leached water and reduced the average soil nitrate N from 306 to 195 mg kg(-1) in the top 0.1-m soil during the fallow period of local farmers' N application rate (870 kg ha(-1)). Reducing the amount of N fertilizer and using catch crop during summer fallow season reduced total N leaching loss by 50 and 73%, respectively, without any negative effect on vegetable yields.					; Zhu, ZhaoLiang/MGU-1717-2025; shi, weiming/F-2176-2013	zhang, hailin/0000-0002-8545-1032; 													1385-1314					SEP	2011	91	1					31	39		10.1007/s10705-011-9441-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-011-9441-5													WOS:000293913100003
J	Jiang, XW; Li, YQ; Yang, S; He, GB				Jiang, Xingwen; Li, Yueqing; Yang, Song; He, Guangbi			Variations of early autumn rainfall in the lee side of the Tibetan Plateau	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The variability of climate in the lee side of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) often exhibits unique features. In this study, the authors investigate the variations of early autumn rainfall in the lee side of the TP (LSTP). The rainfall amount and number of rain days in LSTP increase from August to September. The center of heavy and torrential rains during September is located in LSTP as well. These unique features are attributed to later withdrawal of the East Asian summer monsoon in the middle and higher troposphere compared to the lower troposphere and stronger South Asian summer monsoon and thermal forcing of the TP. The September rainfall in LSTP experienced strong interdecadal fluctuation, with overall below normal rainfall from mid-1980s to late 2000s, while there was no apparent long-term trend in the August and October rainfall amount. The above normal September rainfall is associated with an anomalous anticyclone over the western North Pacific, a weaker-than-normal ridge around the Lake Baikal, a stronger-than-normal East Asian jet stream, and warmer air over the southeastern TP. The interdecadal decrease in rainfall in September may be caused by the central equatorial Pacific warming, which induces an anomalous cyclone over the western North Pacific. The September anomalous cyclone is stronger and more westward compared to that in August and October, and thus favors the below normal rainfall in LSTP.					jiang, xingwen/AFK-0156-2022; Li, Yueqing/LZF-3574-2025														0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2014	117	3-4					565	577		10.1007/s00704-013-1028-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-1028-4													WOS:000339905000019

This paper investigates an annually-laminated (varved) record from the western Canadian Arctic and finds that the varves are negatively correlated with both the instrumental Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the past century and also with reconstructed PDO over the past 700 years, suggesting drier Arctic conditions during high-PDO phases, and vice versa. These results are in agreement with known regional teleconnections, whereby the PDO is negatively and positively correlated with summer precipitation and mean sea level pressure respectively. This pattern is also evident during the positive phase of the North Pacific Index (NPI) in autumn. Reduced sea-ice cover during summer-autumn is observed in the region during PDO-(NPI+) and is associated with low-level southerly winds that originate from the northernmost Pacific across the Bering Strait and can reach as far as the western Canadian Arctic. These climate anomalies are associated with the PDO-(NPI+) phase and are key factors in enhancing evaporation and subsequent precipitation in this region of the Arctic. Collectively, the sedimentary evidence suggests that North Pacific climate variability has been a persistent regulator of the regional climate in the western Canadian Arctic. Since projected sea-ice loss will contribute to enhanced future warming in the Arctic, future negative phases of the PDO (or NPI+) will likely act to amplify this positive feedback.

J	JONSSON, B				JONSSON, B			LIFE-HISTORY PATTERNS OF FRESH-WATER RESIDENT AND SEA-RUN MIGRANT BROWN TROUT IN NORWAY	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Brown trout S. trutta in Vangsvatnet Lake, Norway, include freshwater residents that mature sexually without any sea run and migrants that smoltify and migrate between fresh water and the sea 1 or more years before maturing. Migrants leave Vangsvatnet Lake during spring and move in coastal waters up to 100 km from the lake outlet before they return to their home river in summer or autumn; older migrants return earlier than younger migrants, sexually mature fish before immatures. Both residents and migrants spawn together in tributaries to Vangsvatnet Lake. Young brown trout (parr) grow in the tributaries and lake; lake dwellers grow faster than stream dwellers. Parr that became migrants at age 2 grow faster than part that become residents, but parr that become migrants at age 4 and older grow more slowly than those that become residents. Parr that smoltify or mature at a young age grow faster than parr that do so later. Resident males are 2-8 yr of age, and 13-47 cm in tip length, resident females 3-10 yr and 21-45 cm. Smolts are 2-7 yr old and 14-29 cm long. Mature migrants are 3-9 yr old; males are 29-67 cm and females 34-67 cm long. Sex-ratios were in favor of males among residents, in favor of females among migrants.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1985	114	2					182	194		10.1577/1548-8659(1985)114<182:LHPOFR>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1985)114<182:LHPOFR>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1985AGS5300002
J	Kelly, DL; Iremonger, SF				Kelly, DL; Iremonger, SF			Irish wetland woods: The plant communities and their ecology	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												Floristic and environmental data were recorded from wetland woods in all regions of Ireland, with more intensive studies in the Killarney area. The principal gradients in the environment are found to be edaphic and hydrological. Seven vegetation groups are distinguished; two represent communities not hitherto described from Ireland. Group A is mostly riparian woodland and equates with the Salicetum albo-fragilis. Group B is found in stagnant conditions, mostly near lake shores, and corresponds to the Osmundo-Salicetum atrocinereae. Group C1, a rare community of mires irrigated by calcareous groundwater, equates with the Alnus glutinosa-Carex paniculata community; one site corresponds to classic swamp carr. Group C2, typically associated with springs or flushed sites, largely equates with the Carici remotae-Fraxinetum. Group D, on soils that are waterlogged in winter but dry out in summer, is classified as the deschampsietosum caespitosae subassociation of the Corylo-Fraxinetum. Group E, associated with oligotrophic peat that is relatively dry, equates with the Betuletum pubescentis. Group F, of waterlogged oligotrophic pear, equates with the Sphagnum palustre-Betula pubescens community. The richness and diversity of Irish wetland woods have been underrated; we emphasise the need for active conservation measures.																			0791-7945	2009-003X				JUL	1997	97B	1					1	32																WOS:A1997YG92800001

Conservation efforts, including stocking measures, are widely conducted to safeguard the species and associated ecosystem functions. Due to limited availabilities of adult crayfish, juvenile noble crayfish are frequently released into lakes and rivers during autumn, usually without information on their fate and growth during the following winter. To investigate size -and density dependence of winter mortality and growth of newly stocked noble crayfish we conducted a mes-ocosm experiment in a small artificial lake in northern Germany. The experiment was carried out at water temperatures between 0.7 degrees C and 9.1 degrees C from mid-December until mid-March and simulated stocking densities of 20, 60, and 120 crayfish per square meter with unlimited food availability. Winter mortality rates were generally low and strongly size dependent. Specifically, a winter mortality rate of 9.2% was observed and crayfish with a total length (TL) above 34 mm all survived. The relative risk of mortality in dependence of TL increased by 41-94% (95% CI) with every decreasing centimetre of TL at the onset of winter. Increasing density had no effect on winter survival, but tended to reduce growth. Our work indicates that stocking measures of noble crayfish for conservation reasons can decrease costs and increase prospects of success if juveniles larger than 30 mm TL are used as stocking material.

J	Wong, CSC; Li, XD; Zhang, G; Qi, SH; Peng, XZ				Wong, CSC; Li, XD; Zhang, G; Qi, SH; Peng, XZ			Atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in the Pearl River Delta, China	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Rapid urban and industrial development in China in the last few decades has provoked some serious environmental concerns. As one of the regions with the fastest economic development in China, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) is particularly susceptible to environmental degradation. Atmospheric emissions represent a major pathway of anthropogenic inputs of heavy metals into the surface environment. Samples of atmospheric deposits were collected at urban, suburban and rural locations in the PRD (including Hong Kong) using bulk deposition samplers in the summer and winter seasons of 2001-2002. The samples were analyzed for heavy metal concentrations and Pb isotopic compositions. According to the analytical results, atmospheric deposition of Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn in the PRD (6.43 +/- 3.19, 18.6 +/- 7.88, 12.7 +/- 6.72 and 104 +/- 36.4 mg/m(2) /yr, respectively) was significantly elevated compared with other regions, e.g. the Great Lakes region in North America and the North Sea in Europe. It was also found that atmospheric deposition of Cu, Cr and Zn was generally higher in the summer than that in the winter, which could be caused by the washout effect of the rainy season in the subtropical region. The Pb isotopic composition of the air deposits ((206)pb/Pb-207 1.161-1.177) indicated that atmospheric inputs of Pb derived mainly from anthropogenic sources, e.g. vehicular exhaust and Pb ore in the PRD. However, the distribution of Pb-206/Pb-207 and Pb-208/Pb-207 ratios of some atmospheric deposits in the summer season suggested that atmospheric Pb at some locations of the PRD could be attributed to other anthropogenic source(s).

Identifying the key long-term drivers of the SAM is essential to improve the predictability of future monsoonal trends in the context of current global climate scenarios and increasingly frequent drought and flooding events in this part of the world. Here, we reconstruct similar to 6000 years of climatic and environmental history of the South Asian summer monsoon-fed Bolgoda South Lake and the Horton Plains, and the winter monsoon-fed Panama lagoon, in Sri Lanka to better understand monsoonal operation over this island and its connection to broader climate systems. Multiple proxies (diagnostic biomarkers, hydrogen and carbon isotopes of individual n-alkane, grain size, and Zr/Rb elemental ratio) indicate a sub-millennial scale decreasing trend of summer monsoon rainfall in the wet zone of Sri Lanka alongside an increasing trend of winter monsoon rainfall in the dry zone during the last similar to 6000 years. We also observed multi-centennial scale arid events in the Bolgoda South Lake and Horton Plains records at similar to 3,500 and similar to 1,000 cal years BP. Inverse monsoonal behavior during the mid- and late Holocene seems to be led by the southward migration of the mean latitudinal position of ITCZ, induced by varying solar energy distribution between the Northern and Southern hemispheres due to Earth's processional cycle. Our observations are broadly supported by existing paleoclimatic records from the Indian sub-continent, but abrupt arid phases are asynchronous in the regional records. In addition, these short-term arid conditions do not show systematic correlations with the different modes of climate variables known to have teleconnections with the Indian Ocean monsoon.

Although it is clear that such communities vary in composition both within and between lakes, the environmental factors and processes shaping the diversity and composition of freshwater bacteria are still not fully understood. In order to assess seasonal and spatial variability in lake bacterial communities and identify environmental factors underpinning biogeographical patterns, we performed a large-scale sampling campaign with paired water and sediment sample collection at 18 locations during four seasons in Lake Balihe, a subtropical shallow fish-farming lake in mid-eastern China. Pelagic and benthic bacterial communities were distinctly different in terms of diversity, taxonomic composition and community structure, with Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria dominating lake water, and Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria dominating sediment. Nevertheless, these two communities had stronger spatial concordance and overlap in taxa during spring and autumn seasons. Together, the main drivers of both the spatial and temporal variations in Lake Balihe bacterial communities were identified as water temperature, turbidity, nitrogen and phosphorus availability, and thermal stratification controlled by wind-mixing and activity of the dense farmed fish populations. Notably, populations affiliated with Firmicutes, known to be abundant in fish gut microbiome, were especially abundant in the summer season and locations where high fish biomass was found, suggesting a potential link between fish gut microbiome and the pelagic bacterial communities. Our findings demonstrated seasonal homogenisation of pelagic and benthic bacterial communities linked to marked shifts in a set of seasonally-driven environmental variables including water temperature and nutrient availability.					; Capo, Eric/H-8362-2018	Wang, Zhongyu/0000-0002-1342-3024; Zhong, Meifang/0000-0001-8995-5468; Tian, Wang/0009-0006-2741-140X; Capo, Eric/0000-0001-9143-7061; Zhang, Huayong/0000-0001-8898-8567													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2023	68	1					155	171		10.1111/fwb.14016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14016		NOV 2022											WOS:000883063800001

M.; Jeppesen, Erik			Terrestrial dissolved organic matter inputs drive the temporal dynamics of riverine bacterial ecological networks and assembly processes	WATER RESEARCH												Rivers receive, transport, and are reactors of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM) and are highly influ-enced by changes in hydrological conditions and anthropogenic disturbances, but the effect of DOM composition on the dynamics of the bacterial community in rivers is poorly understood. We conducted a seasonal field sampling campaign at two eutrophic river mouth sites to examine how DOM composition influences the temporal dynamics of bacterial community networks, assembly processes, and DOM-bacteria associations. DOM compo-sition and seasonal factors explained 34.7% of the variation in bacterial community composition, and 14.4% was explained purely by DOM composition where specific UV absorbance (SUVA254) as an indicator of aromaticity was the most important predictor. Significant correlations were observed between SUVA254 and the topological features of subnetworks of interspecies and DOM-bacteria associations, indicating that high DOM aromaticity results in more complex and connected networks of bacteria. The bipartite networks between bacterial taxa and DOM molecular formulae (identified by ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry) further revealed less specialized bacterial processing of DOM molecular formulae under the conditions of high water level and DOM aromaticity in summer than in winter. A shift in community assembly processes from stronger homogeneous selection in summer to higher stochasticity in winter correlated with changes in DOM composition, and more aromatic DOM was associated with greater similarity in bacterial community composition. Our results highlight the importance of DOM aromaticity as a predictor of the temporal dynamics of riverine bacterial community networks and assembly.

J	Khani, HM; Kinnard, C; Lévesque, E				Khani, Hadi Mohammadzadeh; Kinnard, Christophe; Levesque, Esther			Historical Trends and Projections of Snow Cover over the High Arctic: A Review	WATER												Snow is the dominant form of precipitation and the main cryospheric feature of the High Arctic (HA) covering its land, sea, lake and river ice surfaces for a large part of the year. The snow cover in the HA is involved in climate feedbacks that influence the global climate system, and greatly impacts the hydrology and the ecosystems of the coldest biomes of the Northern Hemisphere. The ongoing global warming trend and its polar amplification is threatening the long-term stability of the snow cover in the HA. This study presents an extensive review of the literature on observed and projected snow cover conditions in the High Arctic region. Several key snow cover metrics were reviewed, including snowfall, snow cover duration (SCD), snow cover extent (SCE), snow depth (SD), and snow water equivalent (SWE) since 1930 based on in situ, remote sensing and simulations results. Changes in snow metrics were reviewed and outlined from the continental to the local scale. The reviewed snow metrics displayed different sensitivities to past and projected changes in precipitation and air temperature. Despite the overall increase in snowfall, both observed from historical data and projected into the future, some snow cover metrics displayed consistent decreasing trends, with SCE and SCD showing the most widespread and steady decreases over the last century in the HA, particularly in the spring and summer seasons. However, snow depth and, in some regions SWE, have mostly increased; nevertheless, both SD and SWE are projected to decrease by 2030. By the end of the century, the extent of Arctic spring snow cover will be considerably less than today (10-35%). Model simulations project higher winter snowfall, higher or lower maximum snow depth depending on regions, and a shortened snow season by the end of the century. The spatial pattern of snow metrics trends for both historical and projected climates exhibit noticeable asymmetry among the different HA sectors, with the largest observed and anticipated changes occurring over the Canadian HA.

Studies on the response of these biodiversity to human-mediated effects are still limited. Here, we selected the typical Lake Dianchi to investigate the correlation between macroinvertebrate spatiotemporal dynamics and human-induced eutrophication across a 2-year span (2009-2010). A total of 26 taxa were recorded, and the assemblage pattern of the macroinvertebrate community was mainly controlled by the spatiotemporal (region, season, and year) density fluctuations of some pollution-tolerant species (Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Tubifex tubifex, Branchiura sowerbyi, and Chironomus plumosus). Taxon richness, total density, biomass, and the abundance of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae decreased from the north to the south of the lake but were much higher in 2009 than in 2010. Moreover, the high densities of total assemblages and oligochaete occurred during spring and/or autumn, whereas that of chironomids was only high during summer. The contributions of important factors varied in different seasons, but the community variations were mainly shaped by eutrophication-related factors (e.g., Chla, N, and P). Variance partitioning analyses showed that aquatic factors were able to explain more community variations than sediment (6.9-36.6 vs. 5.3-14.7%) across seasons, but their interactive effects were negligible. The results of this study will be beneficial for restoring and managing hypereutrophic lakes in the Yungui Plateau and imply the necessity of long-term monitoring in bioassessment projects involving intensively disturbed lakes.					; Jiang, Xiaoming/H-8324-2019	Song, Zhuoyan/0000-0002-6056-8568; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2020	27	12					13066	13080		10.1007/s11356-020-07773-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-07773-w		FEB 2020						32016869					WOS:000515861200010

Vertical profiles of temperature, dissolved nutrients (nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus), phytoplankton biomass, and primary productivity were determined in an eleven-station transect encompassing the entire 636 km length of the lake. Pronounced horizontal variability in hydrodynamic conditions was observed, with the southern region of the lake being strongly thermally stratified while the middle and north basins were largely isothermal through July. The extent of depletion of surface water nutrients, and the magnitude of phytoplankton biomass and productivity, were found to be strongly correlated with the degree of thermal stratification. Horizontal differences likely reflected the contribution of two important factors: variation in the timing of ice-out in different parts of the lake (driving large-scare patterns of thermal stratification and other limnological properties) and localized effects of river inflows that may contribute to the preliminary stabilization of the water column in the face of intense turbulent spring mixing (driving meso-scale patterns). Examination of the relationships between surface water inorganic N and P depletion suggested that during the spring and early summer, phytoplankton growth in unstratified portions of the lake was largely unconstrained by nutrient supplies. As summer progressed, the importance of co-limitation by both N and P became more apparent. Uptake and regeneration rates, measured directly using the stable isotope N-15, revealed that phytoplankton in stratified portions of the lake relied primarily on NH4 as their N source. Rates of NH4 regeneration were in approximate equilibrium with uptake; both processes were dominated by organisms <2 mu m. This pattern is similar to that observed for oligotrophic marine systems. Our study underscores the importance of hydrodynamic conditions in influencing patterns of biological productivity and nutrient dynamics that occur in Lake Baikal during its brief growing season.

E. pratensis comprised 3.5% of all nematodes in the littoral, 3.1% in the littoriprofundal and 5.5% in the profundal. The species contributed to a considerable portion of nematode biomass in Konigssee with mean annual biomass being highest at 1 m depth (0.14 mg/100 cm(2) ww; 17% of total nematode biomass) and 2 m depth (0.13 mg/100 cm(2) ww; 22% of total nematode biomass). At 190 m depth it was 40% of total nematode biomass. Population density of E. pratensis peaked three times a year at 1 m and 2 m water depth (spring, summer, winter) and twice in deeper regions. There was considerable water depth and lime dependent variation in sex ratios of E. pratensis. In littoral and littoriprofundal zones the sex ratio was about 1:1, while in the profundal males were very rare. About 48% of E. pratensis individuals were found in the top sediment layer and the percentage increased with increasing water depth. Juveniles and adults of E. pratensis were partially segregated in the sediment column. Morphometric data revealed negligible sexual dimorphism in size, body shape and weight.

Our study presents field data on the nutrient content of benthic invertebrates from Lake Erken (Sweden). The most abundant benthic invertebrates of the littoral community were sampled in 3 seasons at 5 sites to examine the influence of spatial and temporal variation of abiotic conditions on invertebrate C:N:P stoichiometry. The relationships between nutrient ratios and dry mass (DM) of invertebrates were evaluated using regression analysis. Nutrient ratios of periphyton, sampled in an earlier study, were compared to those of benthic invertebrates. C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios differed among invertebrate taxa. Coleoptera had relatively high C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios, whereas Isopoda had low C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios. Nutrient ratios differed with respect to season and location. C:P and N:P ratios were significantly lower and C:N ratios were significantly higher in autumn than in spring and summer. C:P and N:P ratios increased as a functions of invertebrate DM when all taxa were analyzed together. C:N and C:P ratios of periphyton were higher than those of benthic invertebrates, but N:P ratios were similar. Our results suggested that benthic invertebrates have taxon-specific C:N and C:P ratios, but the seasonal variability in ratios indicated that littoral invertebrates were rheostatic rather than homeostatic with respect to nutrient stoichiometry. The temporal and spatial variation in grazer nutrient content must be taken into account when applying stoichiometric theory to benthic food webs.

Concentrations of Pb in gills, liver, kidney, gut and contents of stomach and gut were investigated during winter and summer to elucidate pathways for Pb uptake in these fish. Our study illustrates ratios of Pb concentrations of gills to stomach or gills to intestine (G/S and G/l ratios) to be a valuable tool for evaluating the relative contributions of different pathways of metal uptake in fish. In both sampling periods (winter, summer) the gills appear to represent a major route pf Pb uptake in fish from low alkalinity lakes. However, during the ice-covered period the diet becomes an increasingly important additional source of Pb contamination.																			0049-6979					MAR	1998	102	3-4					303	312		10.1023/A:1004973915619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004973915619													WOS:000072504500005

Siscowet lake charr (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet) visual foraging habitat in relation to daily and seasonal light cycles	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Using siscowet lake charr (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet) as an example organism, we modeled visual foraging habitat in relation to: (i) daily solar and lunar intensity, (ii) seasonal changes in maximum solar and lunar altitude, (iii) foraging for pelagic or benthic prey, and (iv) increased turbidity that may occur with climate change. Siscowet foraging success increased with light intensity and was higher for pelagic prey than benthic prey. Daily and seasonal siscowet foraging patterns were similar for benthic and pelagic prey types. Predicted day-time foraging depths were deepest in summer and shallowest in winter (range 172-233 m for pelagic prey and 210-283 m for benthic prey), and night-time foraging depths were deepest in winter and shallowest in summer (range 25-32 m for pelagic prey and 63-81 m for benthic prey). Within the Lake Superior basin, extreme precipitation events and associated sediment plumes can cause localized declines in light attenuation. Increases in turbidity associated with these sediment plumes can reduce predicted foraging depths by 65% and 80%, when compared to normal lake attenuation values. The model can be applied to predict how solar and lunar patterns influence foraging patterns in any aquatic organism that displays light-mediated behavior.

Seasonal occurrence of anoxygenic photosynthesis in Tillari and Selaulim reservoirs, Western India	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Phytoplankton and bacterial pigment compositions were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in two freshwater reservoirs (Tillari Dam and Selaulim Dam), which are located at the foothills of the Western Ghats in India. These reservoirs experience anoxia in the hypolimnion during summer. Water samples were collected from both reservoirs during anoxic periods while one of them (Tillari Reservoir) was also sampled in winter, when convective mixing results in well-oxygenated conditions throughout the water column. During the period of anoxia (summer), bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) e isomers and isorenieratene, characteristic of brown sulfur bacteria, were dominant in the anoxic (sulfidic) layer of the Tillari Reservoir under low light intensities. The winter observations showed the dominance of small cells of Chlorophyll b-containing green algae and cyanobacteria, with minor presence of fucoxanthin-containing diatoms and peridinin-containing dinoflagellates. Using total BChl e concentration observed in June, the standing stock of brown sulfur bacteria carbon in the anoxic compartment of Tillari Reservoir was estimated to be 2.27 gC m(-2), which is much higher than the similar estimate for carbon derived from oxygenic photosynthesis (0.82 gC m(-2). The Selaulim Reservoir also displayed similar characteristics with the presence of BChl e isomers and isorenieratene in the anoxic hypolimnion during summer. Although sulfidic conditions prevailed in the water column below the thermocline, the occurrence of photo-autotrophic bacteria was restricted only to mid-depths (maximal concentration of BChl e isomers was detected at 0.2% of the surface incident light). This shows that the vertical distribution of photo-autotrophic sulfur bacteria is primarily controlled by light penetration in the water column where the presence of H2S provides a suitable biogeochemical environment for them to flourish.

Fe/P concentration ratio in Mozhaisk reservoir deposits as an indicator of phosphate sorption	WATER RESOURCES												A relationship is established between within-year variations in Fe-tot/P-tot ratio in pore solution and the concentration of organic P compounds in solid phase. The passage of the FeOOH-P system in the silts of the Mozhaisk Reservoir from the aerobic conditions to aerobic is generally accompanied by dissolution of FeOOH and desorption of phosphates. The change from anaerobic conditions to aerobic during the spring and autumn seasons exhibits hysteresis in oxidation of Fe compounds in silts, such that variations in Fe/P ratio in the solid phase of silt do not agree with those in the pore solution.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				MAR	2011	38	2					211	219		10.1134/S0097807810061053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807810061053													WOS:000288957900008

Movement and growth indicators in resident and adfluvial coaster brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in the Hurricane River, Lake Superior, Michigan, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are found throughout Lake Superior, Lake Nipigon, and their tributaries. Lacustrine and adfluvial life history variants were historically popular with anglers and were called coasters: coaster brook trout populations are now severely reduced and are of conservation concern. Coasters were known to grow larger and mature later than their stream resident counterparts. This study compared movement patterns, age, size, condition, and relative weight of wild coaster and resident brook trout from the Hurricane River, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Michigan. Wild brook trout >= 100 mm from the Hurricane River downstream from Hurricane Falls were tagged with passive integrated transponder tags and monitored for stream-lake movement behavior from May 2003 to November 2007. During 2006 and 2007, brook trout were scale sampled and aged to construct a regression that was then used to calculate the age of all brook trout tagged from 2003 to 2007. Most brook trout movement took place in the fall with October the peak month of emigration with a secondary peak in late spring/early summer and some activity nearly year round. There were no differences found in age Structure, Size or condition between coasters and residents while in the stream. Our data suggest that a priori growth differences are not determining the expression of coaster outmigration and that stream-lake movements made by coasters, likely driven by habitat requirements, may be highly flexible and facultative.

J	Köster, D; Pienitz, R				Köster, D; Pienitz, R			Seasonal diatom variability and paleolimnological inferences -: a case study	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The seasonality of physical, chemical, and biological water variables is a major characteristic of temperate, dimictic lakes. Yet, few investigations have considered the potential information that is encoded in seasonal dynamics with respect to the paleolimnological record. We used a one-year sequence of diatoms obtained from sediment traps and water samples, as well as the sedimentary diatom record covering the past ca. 1000 years in Bates Pond, Connecticut (USA), to investigate which variables influence the seasonal distribution of diatoms and how this can be used for the interpretation of the fossil record. The seasonal patterns in diatom assemblages were related to stratification and, to a lesser extent, to nitrate, silica, and phosphorus. During mixing periods in spring and autumn, both planktonic and benthic species were collected in the traps, while few lightly silicified, spindle-shaped planktonic diatoms dominated during thermal stratification in summer. Changes in fossil diatom assemblages reflected human activity in the watershed after European settlement and subsequent recovery in the 20th century. A long-term trend in diatom assemblage change initiated before European settlement was probably related to increased length of mixing periods during the Little Ice Age, indicated by the increase of taxa that presently grow during mixing periods and by application of a preliminary seasonal temperature model. We argue that the analysis of seasonal diatom dynamics in temperate lakes may provide important information for the refinement of paleolimnological interpretations. However, investigations of several lakes and years would be desirable in order to establish a more robust seasonal data set for the enhancement of paleolimnological interpretations.

Laboratory feeding rates of both fish increased for larger particles, reaching maximum values for zooplankton and Peridinium cinctum. Tilapia galilaea had higher feeding rates on Peridinium elpatiewsky and on intermediate-sized nanoplankton. Outdoor mesocosm experiments examining fish impacts on plankton community structure included two 21-d spring and summer experiments of replicated 2 .times. 2 factorial design (T. galilaea .times. T. aurea). Both fish suppressed crustaceans and rotifers. In the spring, fish also suppressed chlorophyll concentration and the dominant phytoplankter P. cinctum. In the summer, when nanoplankton dominated the phytoplankton and the smaller P. elpatiewsky was the most abundant dinoflagellate, only T. galilaea suppressed Peridinium spp., while presence of T. aurea was associated with increased chlorophyll concentration. Overall, T. galilaea suppressed more and enhanced fewer nanoplankton taxa than did T. aurea. Production of each fish species was lowest when both species were together, suggesting potential competition for plankton resources.

Total microplankton biomass was estimated by the ATP, protein and Ppart content in the water samples. Phytoplankton biomass was measured by the ATP, chlorophylla and Ppart concentration, and bacterioplankton biomass was analysed by ATP and AODC. The correlations between different biomass estimators are presented. Total microplankton and phytoplankton biomass production, estimated per 1 .mu.g available P, during summer was ca. 13 times higher than during the spring. The bacterial biomass production per 1 .mu.g of P during summer stratification was ca. 35-fold higher than during spring homothermy. The efficiency of biomass production (per unit of P) by bacteria during summer was ca. 2.7-times higher than biomass production by phytoplankton. Algal uptake of P from ATP (a model phosphoester tested in these studies) was higher than bacterial. In parallel to hydrolysis of ATP, liberated P was immediately taken up by plankton community at the same rates as the rates of ATP hydrolysis. The kinetic parameters of P uptake (Vmax, Kt, Tt) showed the preference of bacteria for orthophosphate uptake. Phytoplankton and higher specific uptake rates (per unit of biomass) of P-ATP than orthophosphate.

J	Bernhardt, J; Kirillin, G				Bernhardt, Juliane; Kirillin, Georgiy			Seasonal pattern of rotation-affected internal seiches in a small temperate lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The aim was to disclose the seasonality in the internal seiches during summer stratification in 2010 within the small, 3 km long, ellipse-shaped, temperate Lake Arendsee (Germany) with simple morphometry. We used observations of temperatures from two thermistor chains (09 April to 24 September), conductivity and temperature profiles, and wind speeds and directions (January to December). To analyze the seasonality in the periods, appearance and modal structure of the seiches, and the wind forcing, we applied spectral analysis on monthly time series of isotherms and wind speeds, and wavelet analysis on 6 month long time series of integrated potential energy and wind speeds. To determine the effect of earth's rotation on seiches, we applied two analytical models based on three-layer density stratification. Earth's rotation affected internal seiches significantly even in a small lake. That was shown by the models and the Burger number being < 1 during stratification. Vertical mode 1 Kelvin-type seiches dominated the internal seiche weather in Lake Arendsee, with their periods changing because of seasonal variations in stratification. Weak, free seiches of vertical mode 2 were amplified during three episodes: (1) in midsummer, when their periods coincided with the inertial period at the lake's latitude, (2) in late spring, and (3) in autumn, both when their periods approached 24 h. The amplifications were caused by resonance between free seiches and wind-forced oscillations at diurnal and inertial periods. Such short-term resonance events, associated with enhanced mixing, are inherent for the seasonal stratification cycle in the most temperate lakes.

By comparing it with the coastal area of the Sea of Japan, regional vegetation patterns affected by East Asian monsoon changes are clarified. During the last interglacial, evergreen broad-leaved forests mainly composed of evergreen oaks developed around Kamiyoshi Basin. In MIS 5e/5d, 5c/5b, 5a/4 transitions, Cryptomeria japonica became dominant, both in the inland area and in the coastal area of the Sea of Japan, under the influence of a strong summer monsoon. In MIS 4, pinaceous conifer forests composed of Pinus subgenus Haploxylon, Tsuga, and Picea developed around Kamiyoshi Basin under a cold and dry climate affected by a strong East Asian winter monsoon and a weak summer monsoon. Mixed forests composed of deciduous broad-leaved trees, temperate conifers, and pinaceous conifers expanded during MIS 3. Meanwhile, C. japonica was dominant in the coastal areas of the Sea of Japan during this period, and Cupressaceae trees were the dominant species in the inland area due to the gradient in winter snowfall caused by the East Asian winter monsoon.

For the inland lake. the earliest hatch date occurred 4 weeks after suitable water temperatures and the latest hatch dates occurred 2 weeks after the water temperatures were considered too warm for spawning. It is inferred that spawning in each lake had a duration of >9 weeks.

In the context of global monitoring of inland waters, we demonstrate the benefit of combining in-situ water analysis, hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing for investigating biogeochemical processes. This methodology has the potential to be used at global scales. We take the example of four Landsat-8 scenes acquired by the OLI sensor and MODIS-Aqua imagery over Lake Geneva (FranceSwitzerland) from spring to early summer 2014. Remotely sensed data suggest a strong temporal and spatial variability during this period. We show that combining the complementary spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of these sensors allows for a comprehensive characterization of estuarine, littoral and pelagic near-surface features. Moreover, by combining in-situ measurements, biogeochemical analysis and hydrodynamic modelling with remote sensing data, we can link these features to river intrusion and calcite precipitation processes, which regularly occur in late spring or early summer. In this context, we propose a procedure that can be used to monitor whiting events in temperate lakes worldwide.

J	Zhang, M; Xu, YY; Shao, ML; Cai, QH				Zhang, Min; Xu, Yaoyang; Shao, Meiling; Cai, Qinghua			Sedimentary nutrients in the mainstream and its five tributary bays of a large subtropical reservoir (Three Gorges Reservoir, China)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												In order to analyze the distribution pattern of the sediment nitrogen and phosphorus of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), the mainstream of TGR and five tributary bays in Hubei province were observed from October 2005 to July 2006. The spatial and seasonal dynamics of the sediment total nitrogen (TNsed) and total phosphorus (TPsed), the relationship between the mainstream and tributary, and the sediment nutrients' effect to the surface water were analyzed. The results showed that, concentrations of TNsed ranged from 0.27 to 2.04 mg/g, and TPsed fluctuated between 0.17 and 1.21 mg/g. Both of the maximum of TNsed and TPsed appeared in the Xiangxi Bay (the longest bays studied), 1.09 and 0.90 mg/g respectively. No significant spatial differences were found among different sites in other bays (p > 0.05). For seasonal dynamics of TPsed, only the difference in the Yuanshui Bay between spring and summer was significant (p < 0.05). For TNsed, significant differences existed among different seasons in most bays, especially between autumn and other seasons. Cluster analysis based on the surface water nutrients and sediment nutrients indicated that the influence range of the mainstream to the surface water ranged from 10.7 to 15.1 km, while the length of the influence range to the sediment was about 5.34 km. Results of the correlation analysis showed that the internal loading in Hubei province of TGR has not caused a significant effect on the surface water in a large spatial scale, although the influence was significant in some shallow regions.

Adult worms disappear in winter. Studies of the cycle in laboratory conditions have shown the importance of first host densities (Cyclops vicinus Ulianine, 1875) for the success of infestations as well as of factors such as eggs maturity and water temperature. Artificial infestations of 0+ whitefish have proved that successful completion of the whole cycle is possible in a laboratory. The different phases of this cycle are described hereafter. The proteocephalan parasite of whitefish from Lake Leman seems to be a good biological tag for the assessment of food requirements of these fish in winter and spring.

J	Caballero, M; Vázquez, G				Caballero, Margarita; Vazquez, Gabriela			Mixing patterns and deep chlorophyll a maxima in an eutrophic tropical lake in western Mexico	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In many temperate oligotrophic lakes, algal accumulations can form below the mixing zone. However, Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCM) have also been found in some eutrophic, tropical lakes and in this paper we aim to identify if they are recurrent features in these kinds of lakes and to recognize the factors that favor their formation. We analyzed 5 years of thermal stratification, water quality, and chlorophyllaconcentrations in a tropical eutrophic lake in Central Mexico. Thermal stratification patterns were characteristic of warm monomictic lakes. Full water column deoxygenation during winter mixing was recorded in 3 of the analyzed years, and an increase of similar to 1 degrees C in the hypolimnion was detected between 2011 and 2015. DCM were detected in 4 out of the 5 studied years, at the top of the hypolimnion when the water column was stratified (spring-summer). This study is the first report of recurrent DCM formation in the northern limit of the Neotropics. It confirms that high light penetration is a necessary condition for DCM. Stratified nutrients with epilimnetic P depletion are also factors favoring DCM formation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2020	847	20			SI		4161	4176		10.1007/s10750-020-04367-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04367-y		AUG 2020											WOS:000558627300002
J	Jorgensen, EH; Johnsen, HK				Jorgensen, Even Hjalmar; Johnsen, Helge Kreutzer			Rhythmic life of the Arctic charr: Adaptations to life at the edge	MARINE GENOMICS												High latitudes are characterized by strong seasonal changes in environmental conditions, including temperature and food availability. To cope with these changes, many high latitude species have developed circannual oscillators that enable them to anticipate and prepare for forthcoming environmental changes and synchronize seasonal events (e.g. reproduction) to environmental fluctuations. The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is the world's northernmost freshwater fish species with a distribution largely confined within the Arctic. In the northernmost part of its distribution they have developed an anadromous life-history strategy implying annual, seaward migrations in the summer to utilize the rich feeding opportunity in the sea. Overwintering in freshwater is characterized by anorexia and energy conservation. The seaward migration in early summer is preceded by physiological and behavioral changes (smolting), by which they develop seawater tolerance (hypoosmoregulatory ability) and migratory behavior. When migrating to the sea, Arctic charr have regained a strong appetite and within 4-6 weeks in the sea they may have doubled their body weight and increased their body fat stores several-fold, in anticipation of the resources needed for reproduction in the autumn and overwintering. All these processes are regulated independently of environmental changes; captive offspring of anadromous charr kept in freshwater displays seasonal changes in seawater tolerance and strong seasonal changes in food intake and growth even when they are continuously fed in excess and held at a constant water temperature in freshwater. A correct timing of these events is crucial for their survival in the Arctic and the Arctic charr seems to possess timing mechanisms that include endogenous, circannual oscillator(s) entrainable by photoperiod. The entrainment mechanism may be linked to diel melatonin rhythms, which in this species exactly mirror overground photoperiod, even during the winter residence in lakes with thick ice and snow. Little is known, however, about how photoperiod, melatonin and putative endogenous dock(s) interact in the generation of seasonal rhythms in fish, and downstream neuroendocrine mechanisms leading to physiological changes. The anadromous Arctic charr seems ideal as a model for studying such mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Water samples were taken fortnightly in the eutrophic western basin and mesotrophic eastern basin. Our study, which took more than one year, revealed pronounced seasonal pattern of the picoplankton abundance and composition. According to our results there were three types of picoplankton in Lake Balaton: 1. Phycoerythrin-rich coccoid cyanobacteria (PE), dominant summer picoplankters in the mesotrophic lake area; 2. Phycocyanin-rich cyanobacteria (PC), the most abundant summer picoplankters in the eutrophic lake area; 3. Picoeukaryotes, dominant winter picoplankters in the whole lake. The observed abundance of picoeukaryotes (3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1)) was one of the highest ever found. Our study confirms that in Lake Balaton the colonial autotrophic picoplankton (colonial APP) become dominant in summer in the nutrient limited period. We have found strong negative relationship between the concentrations of available nitrogen forms (NH4-N, NO3-N, urea-N) and the colonial APP abundance.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2006	91	1					38	50		10.1002/iroh.200510844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200510844													WOS:000235935100004

A total of 417 actinobacterial 16S rRNA gene transcript clones were obtained and they could be classified into acI, acII, acIV, acSTL, Soil II+III [phylogenetic nomenclature for typical freshwater Actinobacteria made in Environ Microbiol 6(3): 242-253 and Appl Environ Microbiol 72(5): 3489-3497], some known suborders (e. g., Corynebacteriaceae, Micrococcineae, Micromonosporineae, Streptosporangineae), and unclassified Actinomycetales. Among these groups, RNA-based clone sequences affiliated with the acIV group were dominant, different from previously described freshwater ecosystems determined by using DNA techniques, suggesting that the planktonic actinobacterial community near the TGD may be unique. The seasonal (summer vs. winter) variation of the planktonic actinobacterial communities was more evident than the spatial (behind vs. in front of the dam) change. The effect of the TGD on actinobacterial community diversity and composition was more obvious in winter than in summer. Overall, the altered water dynamics due to the TGD construction are likely important reasons for the observed variations.

Fluorescent sediment particles (63-350 mu m) were supplied as a tracer pulse input at the sediment surface. Tracer depth profiles obtained after 15 and 20 days were simulated with a diffusion-advection-non-local transport model. This allowed the rates of biodiffusion (D(b)), bioadvection (W), and RS, a non-local transport coefficient to account for the displacement of sediment by regeneration, to be estimated. A combination of fresh water and marine organisms were responsible for the recorded sediment reworking, which was dominated by both types of non-local transports (conveying and regeneration). Considering all the sampling sites and seasons, Db ranged from 0.87 +/- .02 to 3.17 +/- .92 cm(2) y(-1), W from 0.12 +/- .09 to 27.41 +/- .47 cm y(-1) and RS from 0.00 +/- .00 to 5.47 +/- .09 g cm(-2) y(-1) (mean SE, n = 3). A multiple regression analysis was applied to identify the contribution from individual species to sediment transport types. Biodiffusion resulted from the combined activity of polychaetes such as Spio decoratus and meiobenthic harpacticoYd copepods, while the polychaete Hediste diuersicolor was mainly responsible for regeneration. Conveying processes were driven by another polychaete, Capitella capitata. Despite heterogeneity in the benthic community composition, biodiffusion and regeneration rates did not vary significantly between sites or season, with only bioadvection found to be higher in spring than in autumn.

Impacts of residential fertilizer ordinances on Florida lacustrine water quality	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Despite the assumption that residential fertilizer ordinances improve regional water quality, their impacts across space and time largely remain unknown. Here, we analyze changes in water quality of lakes throughout the State of Florida from 1987 to 2018, comparing trends in water quality parameters before and after implementation of county-wide fertilizer ordinances. We used a large dataset of publicly collected water quality data and linear mixed models to analyze ordinance impacts on total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and Secchi depth across 160 lakes throughout Florida. We further analyze water quality impacts relative to the type of ordinance (winter fertilizer ban, summer ban, nonseasonal ban, no ban). We found fertilizer ordinances favorably impacted lacustrine water quality, and winter (dry season) fertilizer bans had the greatest effect across all water quality metrics. Results of this study can be used to support the effectiveness of fertilizer ordinances across humid tropical and subtropical climate regions.					; Smidt, Samuel/AAZ-1189-2020	Reisinger, Alexander/0000-0003-4096-2637; 														2378-2242				DEC	2022	7	6					475	482		10.1002/lol2.10279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10279		AUG 2022											WOS:000847668800001

Seasonal variation of phytoplankton nutrient limitation in Lake Erie	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Phosphorus (P) has been identified as the primary nutrient limiting phytoplankton biomass in them Laurentian Great Lakes, and thus phytoplankton biomass varies as a function of P loading. While management efforts have reduced point sources of P, a recent rise in non-point source loadings arid the introduction of dreissenid mussels to the Great Lakes are factors suspected to have direct and indirect impacts on nutrient cycling. We re-evaluated nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in the central basin of Lake Erie over spatial (i.e. 3 offshore stations) and temporal (i.e. monthly from June to October) scales. The nutrient limitation of the phytoplankton was evaluated using biomass response measurements to nutrient enrichment bioassays in a complete factorial of P, nitrogen (N), and silicon (Si). Nutrient additions yielded classic growth curves after 7 to 12 d of incubation. Treatments with added P had higher final biomass yields than treatments without P at all stations and during all months. During spring overturn, P+ Si yielded higher phytoplankton biomass than did P additions without Si at 2 of the 3 stations. During the late stratification to autumn overturn (August to October), P+N promoted higher phytoplankton biomass than did P additions without N; this was true at all stations. A quantitative assessment of the bioassays indicated that 63 to 94 % of the biomass yield during spring overturn could be attributed to Si, while 48 to 68 % of the biomass yield during late stratification and autumn overturn could be attributed to N. Water chemistry data collected in 2002 and 2003 predicted similar seasonal trends in nutrient limitation. These results suggest that seasonal variation in phytoplankton nutrient limitation is a probable factor in predicting changes in phytoplankton biomass and taxonomic composition in the central basin of Lake Erie.

Recruitment Dynamics of Age-0 Yellow Perch in a Drowned River Mouth Lake: Assessing Synchrony with Nearshore Lake Michigan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We assessed recruitment dynamics of juvenile Yellow Perch Perca flavescens in coastal habitats of eastern Lake Michigan. To investigate recruitment patterns and associations with environmental factors in a coastal drowned river mouth (DRM) lake, we sampled juvenile Yellow Perch seasonally in Muskegon Lake, Michigan, during 20032011. We also sampled three nearshore sites in Lake Michigan each fall to evaluate synchrony between the DRM lake and nearshore habitat. In Muskegon Lake, age-0 Yellow Perch CPUE during fall was high in 2005 and 2007; moderate in 2008, 2010, and 2011; and low in other years. Fall CPUE (age 0) was positively associated with CPUE in the next spring (age 1; slope = 0.98; R 2 = 0.95), which we attribute to high overwinter survival. Fall CPUE of age-0 Yellow Perch showed a positive relationship with June air temperature (R 2 = 0.76), suggesting that warm conditions at early larval stages positively influence recruitment of juveniles. Juvenile recruitment in Muskegon Lake was not synchronized with juvenile recruitment in nearshore Lake Michigan. The lack of synchrony may be an indication that (1) age-0 Yellow Perch recruitment in DRM lakes and Lake Michigan are influenced by different environmental controls and (2) dispersal between the two habitats does not strongly affect age-0 recruitment dynamics.

Phytoplankton trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes (2001-2021) reveal significant changes in phytoplankton abundance and taxonomic composition	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We present Laurentian Great Lakes phytoplankton trends from 2001 to 2021 in spring and summer. Trend analysis identified significant changes in phytoplankton abundance and taxonomic composition. This included the loss of phytoplankton biovolume, especially diatoms, in lakes Huron and Michigan following the quagga mussel invasion, an increase in cyanobacteria especially in the central basin of Lake Erie, and an increase in phytoplankton biovolume in Lake Superior. Within functional groups, we observed increases in the absolute and relative abundances of flagellated organisms, largely owing to increases in single-celled cryptophytes and dinoflagellates in the spring and colonial chrysophytes in the summer, and a rise in lightly silicified rhizosolenoid diatoms during summer. Random forest analysis identified potential drivers and mechanisms for phytoplankton changes alongside concurrently sampled invertebrate and water quality parameters. The quagga mussel invasion was an important driver of major phytoplankton shifts, but climate change-related stressors affecting stratification are also likely drivers of changes. We observed strong relationships between phytoplankton and microzooplankton, with rotifers and copepod nauplii showing positive relationships with many phytoplankton groups, though whether these are top-down or bottom-up associations is not clear. This study recognizes continuing reorganization of the Great Lakes phytoplankton community that is likely to have long-term impacts on food webs.

The physical processes leading to thermocline evolution are examined from the vertical temperature profile observed along the reservoir before and after rain. Observations show that their evolution is related to the inflow of runoff, which is colder than the reservoir surface water and post-rain fair-weather conditions. Tongue-like distributions of turbidity, conductivity and nutrient concentrations downstream from the headwater clearly reveal the presence of runoff-induced intermediate inflows. In addition to supplying nutrients, the inflow provides the oxygen-deficient intermediate layer with a rich supply of dissolved oxygen. Concurrently, in the upper part of the reservoir runoff-induced inflows may drive the oxygen-deficient bottom water to shift downstream along the layer beneath the runoff-induced inflow. The water mass between the two thermoclines may operate as a source of nutrients for algal development in early autumn when the upper thermocline is destroyed by the convective overturn owing to the surface cooling.

However, few systematic studies have been conducted on the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater recharge. In this study, stable isotopes of precipitation and groundwater were used to explore the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater recharge in the lower reaches of the Poyang Lake Basin of China, a region affected by the interplay of different monsoons. The results indicated that isotopic values (delta H-2 and delta O-18) of precipitation exhibited obvious seasonal variations, higher in winter and lower in summer, controlled by different monsoons. The stable isotopes of groundwater also presented distinct seasonal variations, revealing the dominant influence of seasonal precipitation, but they had different characteristics in space. In the northern study area and Rao and Xin Basins, the isotopic signatures of groundwater showed the shift to lower values in summer and higher values in winter, consistent with those of precipitation, while in the Ganfu Plain, which is characterized by poorly permeable strata, isotopic signatures of groundwater presented opposite temporal variations than those of precipitation (lagged behind precipitation).

The water and plants were taken from an oxbow lake in spring (when S. aloides plants were submerged) and in summer (when plants were floating on lake water surface). Water extracts were prepared from fresh healthy leaves obtained on both sampling occasions. Control containers were supplemented with N and P in amounts similar to those introduced to experimental containers with macrophyte extracts. That way the experimental set up excluded the possibility of phytoplankton limitation by nutrients. Under such conditions the extracts from S. aloides strongly reduced phytoplankton biomass measured as the concentration of chlorophyll a (from 370 to 141 mg chl. a m(-3) in spring and from 266 to 50 mg chl. a m(-3) in summer). The inhibition of phytoplankton growth was indirectly confirmed by higher concentrations of available nutrients in experimental versus control containers. The extracts affected also the spring phytoplankton community structure by selective inhibition of diatoms and, to a less extent, of green algae and Cryptophyceae. Similar response of phytoplankton biomass to extracts obtained from submerged and floating S. aloides might suggest that allelochemicals were the constitutive part of macrophyte tissue and their production was not induced by competition between macrophyte and algae.

Both local and field significances were tested by using statistical methods. Areas of both negative and positive precipitation-temperature correlations were found. Over most of the United States, summer precipitation and temperature were negatively correlated, which indicates that warm summers tended to be dryer. This is particularly true in the central and southern Great Plains. The area south of the Great Lakes covering the eastern portion of the Com Belt was the only major area where a significant positive correlation was found in winter.																			0894-8755					JUN	1993	6	6					1232	1236		10.1175/1520-0442(1993)006<1232:TRBPAT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1993)006<1232:TRBPAT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1993LK39700021
J	DIAZ, MM; PEDROZO, FL				DIAZ, MM; PEDROZO, FL			SEASONAL SUCCESSION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN A SMALL ANDEAN PATAGONIAN LAKE (REP ARGENTINA) AND SOME CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE PEG MODEL	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Phytoplankton structure and its seasonal succession were studied during one year in Escondido lake (71-degrees 31'W; 41-degrees 05'S) in relation with physical and nutrient characteristics. The Lake is oligotrophic (Secchi depth = Z(max); [TP]avg = 5 mug L-1; [chla]avg = 1.2 mgm-3), small (8 Ha) with very dilute waters and dominated by dissolved silica and calcium bicarbonate. Algae growth was limited most of the year by phosphorus (N/ P average = 39), while nitrogen would be limitant during intermittent periods not clearly defined. The silica concentrations were never limiting, being five to six fold higher ([SiO2]avg = 17 mg L-1) than those considered (PATRICK, 1977) limiting to diatom growth. Seasonal phytoplankton succession can be described in biomass terms with an unimodal pattern with maximum values during january to April. Dinoflagellates were dominant in summer; in autumm approximately 50% of the phytoplankton corresponded both to diatoms and dinoflagellates; during winter to spring the diatoms were dominant in coincidence with maximum Si/P and N/P ratios. Turbulence and nutrient ratios could be the main factors to determine the succession between dinophyceae and diatoms. Lake oligotrophy and nutrient limitation sequence imply that the steps proposed in PEG model can be only fullfilled partially.																			0003-9136					APR	1993	127	2					167	184																WOS:A1993LG24300004
J	Wang, W; Feng, ZD				Wang, Wei; Feng, Zhaodong			Holocene moisture evolution across the Mongolian Plateau and its surrounding areas: A synthesis of climatic records	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Based on the review of 26 high-standard Holocene climatic reconstructions (mainly pollen-based) from the Mongolian Plateau and its surrounding areas, temporal and spatial patterns of the Holocene moisture evolution are synthesized. The regionally-averaged moisture history from the summer monsoon-influenced semi-arid belt in China (i.e., Region A) demonstrates that the moisture index curve is broadly in agreement with the synthesized East Asian Monsoon Strength curve, both following the general trend of the West Tropical Pacific SST that is in turn the delayed response to the northern hemispheric summer solar insolation. The regionally-averaged moisture indices from the winter monsoon-dominated southern Siberia including Lake Baikal area and the Altai Mountains (i.e., Region B) exhibit a general declining trends since 10.6-9.6 cal. kyr BP, being largely consistent with the trends of the annual precipitation and the warm-season temperature in the Russian Plain. The consistency might be attributable to the Holocene declining trend of the warm-season temperature in North Atlantic region. The predominant feature of the regionally-averaged moisture index from the westerlies-affected northern Xinjiang (i.e., Region C) is a persistent increasing trend since 8 cal. kyr BP. The wetting trend of northern Xinjiang during the past 8000 years might be attributable to the increasing trend of winter insolation and to the associated increasing trend of cold-season temperature in northwestern Europe. The chronological correspondences between dry phases and warm intervals in the arid areas of the Mongolian Plateau (i.e., northern Mongolian Plateau within Mongolia and southern Mongolian Plateau within China, Region D) lend a support to the proposal that the mid-Holocene dry phase was most likely the result of mid-Holocene high warm-season temperature.

Stratigraphic relationships suggest that they are two distinct tephras. Binary plots and standard similarity coefficients of electron probe microanalysis data have been supplemented with principal component analysis to correlate the two tephra layers to known regional tephras. Using principal component analysis, we are furthermore able to bound our uncertainty in the correlation of the two tephra layers. After removal of outliers, within the 95% prediction interval, we can say that one tephra layer is likely the Rockland tephra, aged 565-610 ka, and the second layer is likely from Mt. Mazama, the Trego Hot Springs tephra, aged similar to 29 lea. In the case of the Rockland tephra, the new findings suggest that dispersal to the north was highly restricted. For Trego Hot Springs ash, the new findings extend the distribution to the southwest, with a rapid thinning in that direction. Coupled with considerations of regular tephra dispersal patterns, the results suggest that the primary dispersal direction for both tephras was to the south, and that occurrences in other directions are unlikely or otherwise anomalous.

Methane production rates for oxygenated and anoxic sediments were quite consistent throughout the year, ranging from .apprx. 1.0 to .apprx. 10 mmol m-2 sediment day-1. Methane oxidation rates were highly variable (0.02-32 mmol m-2 lake surface day-1) as were evasion rates (0.0-60 mmol m-2 lake surface day-1). Oxidation and evasion rates both peaked during fall overturn and were very low during the remainder of the year. Methane production was important in regenerating carbon from sediments. Of total carbon input, 55% was regenerated as methane during 1 yr and 36% of this total C input was recycled by methane oxidation. Methane oxidation was not an important source of CO2 for primary producers or of seston for secondary grazers during the summer. During some winters production of particulate C by methane oxidizers may have been an important source of seston for grazers. Methane oxidation was the most important contributor to the development of total lake anoxia under ice cover.

J	Cook, EJ; Van der Kaars, S				Cook, Ellyn J.; Van der Kaars, Sander			Development and testing of transfer functions for generating quantitative climatic estimates from Australian pollen data	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												We review attempts to derive quantitative climatic estimates from Australian pollen data, including the climatic envelope, climatic indicator and modern analogue approaches, and outline the need to pursue alternatives for use as input to, or validation of, simulations by models of past, present and future climate patterns. To this end, we have constructed and tested modern pollen-climate transfer functions for mainland southeastern Australia and Tasmania using the existing southeastern Australian pollen database and for northern Australia using a new pollen database we are developing. After testing for statistical significance, I I parameters were selected for mainland southeastern Australia, seven for Tasmania and six for northern Australia. The functions are based on weighted-averaging partial least squares regression and their predictive ability evaluated against modern observational climate data using leave-one-out cross-validation. Functions for summer, annual and winter rainfall and temperatures are most robust for southeastern Australia, while in Tasmania functions for minimum temperature of the coldest period, mean winter and mean annual temperature are the most reliable. In northern Australia, annual and summer rainfall and annual and summer moisture indexes are the strongest. The validation of all functions means all can be applied to Quaternary pollen records from these three areas with confidence.

Landscape controls on total and methyl Hg in the upper Hudson River basin, New York, USA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Approaches are needed to better predict spatial variation in riverine Hg concentrations across heterogeneous landscapes that include mountains, wetlands, and open waters. We applied multivariate linear regression to determine the landscape factors and chemical variables that best account for the spatial variation of total Hg (THg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations in 27 sub-basins across the 493 km(2) upper Hudson River basin in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. THg concentrations varied by sixfold, and those of MeHg by 40-fold in synoptic samples collected at low-to-moderate flow, during spring and summer of 2006 and 2008. Bivariate linear regression relations of THg and MeHg concentrations with either percent wetland area or DOC concentrations were significant but could account for only about 1/3 of the variation in these Hg forms in summer. In contrast, multivariate linear regression relations that included metrics of (1) hydrogeomorphology, (2) riparian/wetland area, and (3) open water, explained about 66% to >90% of spatial variation in each Hg form in spring and summer samples. These metrics reflect the influence of basin morphometry and riparian soils on Hg source and transport, and the role of open water as a Hg sink. Multivariate models based solely on these landscape metrics generally accounted for as much or more of the variation in Hg concentrations than models based on chemical and physical metrics, and show great promise for identifying waters with expected high Hg concentrations in the Adirondack region and similar glaciated riverine ecosystems.

J	Parker, JE; Maberly, SC				Parker, JE; Maberly, SC			Biological response to lake remediation by phosphate stripping: control of Cladophora	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The North and South Basins of Windermere, Cumbrial have experienced a large increase in concentrations of nutrients, particularly phosphate, since 1945 when detailed measurements began. Over-winter concentrations have increased from 1 to 3 mg PO4-P m(-3) in the 1940s, up to 30 mg PO4-P m(-3) in the South Basin of Windermere in the early 1990s where nutrient enrichment has been most marked. A visible manifestation of this 'eutrophication' in recent years has been the production of a large biomass by the green filamentous macroalga, Cladophora. 2. Since April 1992, tertiary chemical stripping of phosphate at the two sewage treatment plants on Windermere has reduced direct sources of phosphate to both basins. In the South Basin, over-winter concentrations of phosphate have fallen to values similar to those in the early 1970s. 3. The biomass of Cladophora has declined markedly in response to the reduced phosphate availability. Significant relationships were found between the annual maximum biomass of Cladophora and two measures of phosphate availability: the over-winter concentration and, more strongly, the day of year when the concentration fell below 1 mg m(-3) 4. The annual biomass maxima of Cladophora since 1945, estimated from the regressions, showed a gradual increased potential for biomass production after 1965 as phosphate concentrations increased, followed by a striking and rapid biological response to lake remediation by phosphate stripping.

Adult (ages 2-4) fish fed on a mixed diet (ORG > 30%; C:N < 7:1) of zooplankton and organic detritus in early summer, and on detrital materials (ORG < 16%; C:N > 11:1) during the remainder of the growing season. Age 0 (< 35 mm standard length) fish ingested only detrital materials. The nutritional quality (ORG = 10 - 20%; C:N < 11:1) of these foods displayed little seasonal variation, but was higher than that of organic detritus taken by adult fish in late summer and autumn. Growth and condition of gizzard shad were poor when the diet consisted of detrital materials; however, age 4 fish (1983) grew rapidly and condition improved when zooplankton were consumed. These results suggest that ingestion of poor-quality detritus can reduce the growth and condition of gizzard shad in Acton Lake, whereas the seasonal inclusion of high-quality zooplankton in the diet can result in rapid growth and improved condition.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	1987	20	2					129	142		10.1007/BF00005292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005292													WOS:A1987J704600005

In particular, the various water system structures within these campuses play a significant role in enhancing the microclimate of waterfront spaces. This research further elucidates the microclimatic regulatory functions of different water system configurations in waterfront areas located in regions with hot and humid conditions, thereby providing theoretical support for climate-adaptive development in similar urban environments. This study focuses on Xihua University, located in the suburbs of Chengdu, China, employing field measurements of the microclimate and numerical simulations using ENVI-met to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the microclimatic conditions at five distinct locations representing three types of water bodies on campus: overland permeable natural waterways, drainage channels, and ornamental lake surfaces. Notably, this research performs simulation analyses under extreme climatic conditions characterized by hot and humid conditions, assessing the micro-climate regulation efficiency of various waterway structures based on meteorological factors such as air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The research findings indicate that the efficiency of microclimate regulation varies significantly among different water systems within campus waterfront spaces. During the summer, the microclimatic regulatory function of the campus water system is relatively limited; however, in winter, the open landscape lake demonstrates a pronounced capacity for microclimate regulation. Additionally, factors such as the openness of waterfront spaces, surrounding buildings, and vegetation also exert a notable influence on the microclimatic environment. Moreover, in the development of urban waterfront spaces within regions characterized by hot and humid conditions, it is essential to consider the influence of vegetation, buildings, and surface materials on the micro-climatic environment associated with water systems. Additionally, the arrangement and configuration of buildings and plants should be tailored to reflect seasonal variations in local climate conditions, thereby creating waterfront activity spaces that are well-adapted to these climatic factors.																			1552-6100	1943-4618				SPR	2025	20	2								10.3992/jgb.20.2.111	http://dx.doi.org/10.3992/jgb.20.2.111													WOS:001487972200006

Recent climate extremes alter alpine lake ecosystems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Here, we show that alpine lake ecosystems are responsive to interannual variation in climate, based on long-term limnological and meteorological data from the Canadian Rockies. In the 2000s, in years with colder winter temperatures, higher winter snowfall, later snowmelt, shorter ice-free seasons, and dryer summers, relative to the 1990s, alpine lakes became clearer, warmer, and mixed to deeper depths. Further, lakes became more dilute and nutrient-poor, the latter leading to significant declines in total phytoplankton biomass. However, increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in lake water stimulated the appearance of small mixotrophic algal species, partially offsetting the decline in autotrophic phytoplankton biomass and increasing algal species richness. The climate regime in the 2000s altered the physical, chemical, and biological character and the function of high-elevation aquatic ecosystems. Forecasts of increased climatic variability in the future pose serious ramifications for both the biodiversity and ecosystem function of high-elevation lakes.

There is a large degree of uncertainty regarding the relationship between N2O emissions and the progress of lake eutrophication, and the mechanisms underlying N2O emissions are poorly understood. Here, N2O emission fluxes and environmental variables in different lakes along a trophic state gradient in the Yangtze River basin were studied. N2O emission fluxes were -1.0-53.0 mu g m(-2) h(-)(1) and 0.4-102.9 mu g m(-2) h(-1) in summer and winter, respectively, indicating that there was marked variation in N2O emissions among lakes of different trophic state. The non-linear exponential model explained differences in N2O emission fluxes by the degree of eutrophication (p < 0.01). TN and chl-a both predicted 86% of the N2O emission fluxes in shallow lakes. The predicted N2O emission fluxes based on the IPCC EF5r overestimated the observed fluxes, particularly those in hyper-eutrophic lakes. These findings demonstrated that nutrient-rich conditions and algal accumulation are key factors determining N2O emission fluxes in shallow lakes. Furthermore, this study also revealed that temperature and algae accumulation-decomposition determine an N2O emission flux in an intricate manner. A low temperature, i.e., winter, limits algae growth and low oxygen consumption for algae decomposition. The environment leaves a high dissolved oxygen concentration, slowing down N2O consumption as the final step of denitrification. In summer, with the oxygen consumed by excess algal decomposition, the N2O production is limited by the complete denitrification as well as the limited substrate supply of nitrate by nitrification in hypoxic or anoxic conditions. Such cascading events explained the higher N2O emission fluxes from shallow lakes in winter compared with summer. This trend was amplified in hyper-eutrophic shallow lakes after algal disappearance. Collectively, algal accumulation played a dual role in stimulating and impeding N2O emissions, especially in hyper-eutrophic lakes. This study expands our knowledge of N2O emissions from shallow lakes in which eutrophication is underway.

Quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of recharge in a composite Great Lakes watershed using a high-resolution hydrology model and multi-source data	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Understanding the timing, location and rates of recharge is important for sustainable groundwater management and effective management of groundwater-dependent ecosystems. This paper explores the spatiotemporal distributions of large- and small-recharge events in a composite watershed in the Great Lakes region and examines the impacts of climate, land use/land cover, soils, and topography on simulated recharge. Novel aspects of the work include recharge estimation using an integrated hydrologic model and constraining the model using field observations of baseflows in both perennial and intermittent streams in the region as well as the United States Geological Survey (USGS) streamflows, groundwater heads, and satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET) products. Simulated high (low) recharge values were associated with high (low) elevations and regions of low (high) ET. The temporal dynamics of recharge are dominated by interannual climate variations, but are also affected by land cover types and soil types. Recharge occurred year-round in agricultural lands but intermittently in forested lands with both recharge and discharge occurring at different times within the same grid cell. Major recharge pulses were associated with spring snowmelt and also occurred in summer and fall and sometimes in late fall but there was considerable variability from year to year depending on the dominant land use and climate. Our approach based on the use of an integrated hydrologic model combined with multi-source data can be used in larger areas and is suitable for studying climate change impacts on groundwater resources.

SEASONAL INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE 2 BIOTIC GROUPS	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We measured phytoplankton and bacteria stocks and production in subalpine Eastern Brook Lake (Sierra Nevada, California) from August 1986 to November 1987 in order to characterize carbon pools and fluxes of the two biotic components. This paper discusses seasonal interrelationships between microalgae and bacteria; an accompanying paper synthesizes the data, gives ranges for the values, and compares them with data from other high-elevation lakes. Phytoplankton and bacteria responded physiologically to physiochemical variations. In late fall (1986) phytoplankton and bacteria were inversely related-algal parameters declined and bacterial parameters increased - probably because of release of organic matter from algae stressed by low light and temperatures. Bacterial carbon demand increased from 20% of contemporaneous primary production to as high as 260%. This suggests a substantial role of bacteria in lake carbon dynamics. Values > 100% may indicate utilization of algal detritus and/or allochthonous organic matter. Another inverse relationship between chlorophyll levels and bacterial abundance/production occurred under the ice cover in 1987. The bacterivorous alga Dinobryon bloomed, chlorophyll increased, and bacterial parameters decreased. Bacterial production, based on detritus and dissolved organic matter, may have sustained Dinobryon and the lake ecosystem under the ice. In the late spring 1987, algae and bacteria were positively related as all parameters increased from winter conditions.

Official records show that there were a total of thirteen major maritime disasters possibly caused by tropical cyclones. Maritime disaster variation trends indicate that tropical cyclones tend to strike the southern coast of China during a La Nina-like stage whereas an El Nino-like stage leads to tropical cyclones being guided northward toward the Korean Peninsula and Japan. During China's Yuan Dynasty (AD 1271-1368) Kublai Khan tried to invade Japan twice during an El Nino-like stage and encountered intense tropical cyclones, which the Japanese called Kamikaze. During a La Nina-like stage, multiple maritime disasters occurred in the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea in the Qing Dynasty (AD 1636-1912). Indeed, the historical record of the Qing Dynasty details maritime disasters at least 9 times. These events were also caused by tropical cyclones. In addition, statistics on the seasons of tropical cyclone genesis and their landfall locations from AD 1945-2013 in the Northwest Pacific Ocean region reveal that in summer, tropical cyclones tend to make landfall along coastal regions north of Fujian Province, eastern China; however, in autumn and winter, cyclones tend to be guided further southward to make landfall in southern China (Hainan), Vietnam, and the Philippines. This phenomenon in seasonal variation is reflected in the maritime disaster events recorded for coastal regions of southeastern China and landfall locations of tropical cyclones. during the Qing Dynasty.

J	BERBEROVIC, R				BERBEROVIC, R			ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION OF 2 COEXISTING DAPHNIA SPECIES DURING THE SEASONAL COURSE OF POPULATION DEVELOPMENT IN LAKE CONSTANCE	OECOLOGIA												In 1986 and 1987 the seasonal course of population density, life history traits and biomass composition (CHN-elemental and ash) of two coexisting Daphnia species from L. Constance (Uberlinger See) were studied. The two daphnids are morphologically similar, but demonstrate different seasonal variation of behaviour (i.e. diurnal vertical migration). With the exception of nitrogen content, the mean biomass composition of adults and that of eggs were significantly different: the dry biomass of eggs (adults) contained on average 55.6 (46.1) % C, 7.9 (6.5) % H, 9.7 (9.7) % N, and 10.0 (23.8) % ash. These values were similar to those of other daphnids; it may be concluded that the average daphnid composition is not species specific, but is determined mainly by the position in the life cycle and by the nutritional state of the animal. A distinct seasonal variation in the elemental composition of the biomass of adult daphnids was observed. It related significantly to the concentration of food, as indicated by the epilimnetic chlorophyll-a concentrations and by Secchi depth. From the amplitude of seasonal variation of elemental composition and from the shape of relationships between the elemental composition of daphnids and their food, it can be concluded that in summer the non-migrating D. galeata lives under stronger food limitation than the migrating D. hyalina. In spring ther were no differences in the biomass composition of either species. In summer, the adult females of D. galeata contained significantly less carbon, and hydrogen than those of D. hyalina. In most parameters of biomass (i.e. biomass composition of adults) and of life history (i.e. clutch size, mean adult weight), D. galeata displayed higher coefficients of variation. A tendency in D. galeata to have peaks of population development earlier in the season and in D. hyalina to have them towards autumn was observed. These contrasting responses of the populations development, the seasonal variability of the biomass composition seem to support the view of Geller (1986) who called D. galeata and D. hyalina "exploitative" and "conservative" strategists respectively.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1990	84	3					340	350		10.1007/BF00329757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00329757								28313023					WOS:A1990EC00700006

Endemic Bear Lake whitefish (Prosopium abyssicola) and Bonneville whitefish (Prosopium spilonotus) are benthic, morphologically similar, and closely related, yet the extent of differential resource use remains poorly understood. To determine the ecological differences between these two species, we studied their seasonal distribution and diet in Bear Lake, Utah-Idaho. We used bottom-set gill nets to examine how catch of each species of whitefish varied in relation to depth and season (spring and summer). In both spring and summer, Bonneville whitefish dominated the shallower depths (5-30 m), whereas Bear Lake whitefish dominated the deeper depths (45-55 m). Bonneville whitefish ate a variety of benthic invertebrates, but mostly Chironomidae, whereas Bear Lake whitefish fed mostly on Ostracoda. These data describe a closely related morphologically similar, yet ecologically distinct group of whitefish in an ecoregion completely different from those studied before. These results indicated that each species has a very different role in the Bear Lake ecosystem. To conserve this unique fish assemblage, both shallow and deepwater habitats need to be protected.					; Luecke, Chris/A-2040-2011	Kennedy, Benjamen/0000-0002-8062-1055; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	2006	63	8					1700	1709		10.1139/F06-065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F06-065													WOS:000239655100004
J	Azizoglu, E; Kara, R; Celik, E				Azizoglu, Erkan; Kara, Ridvan; Celik, Emrah			A statistical approach on distribution and seasonal habitat use of waterfowl and shorebirds in cildir Lake (Ardahan, Turkiye)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Wetlands are crucial habitats for both migrant and resident bird assemblages. The distribution and habitat preferences of birds in aquatic ecosystems are significantly influenced by environmental and ecological factors that critically impact the relevant habitats. In order to reveal the distribution and habitat preferences of the birds, many statistical models and methodologies are employed in ecology and conservation biology. Herein, we investigated the effects of year, season, habitat, and species variables on the distribution and population dynamics of waterfowls and shorebirds associated with the wetland. In this regard, field surveys were carried out in and around cildir Lake (Ardahan, Turkiye) between April 2017 and September 2018 to examine the distribution of waterfowls and shorebirds and variations in population sizes. As an experimental design, a stratified random sampling design was used to assess bird fauna in the four dominant habitat types (open water surface, reeds, grasslands, and agricultural areas) in the study area. Accordingly, a total of 51 waterfowl and shorebird species were identified during the study period. Of the identified families, Anatidae (n = 18), Scolopacidae (n = 8), and Ardeidae (n = 8) were the most common families. Considering bird species, common coot Fulica atra and mallard Anas platyrhynchos were the most abundant species. The dependent variable (bird populations) was compared with the independent variables (year, season, habitat, and species). The population in 2018 decreased by 13% in comparison to the population in 2017 (p < 0.05). Once the reed area was considered as the reference, the population density in the water surface habitat increased by 65% (p < 0.001). In relation to seasonal reference, a 65% increase in population growth in spring was recorded in comparison to the growth in fall (p < 0.001). On the other hand, no statistical differences were noted in population growth in winter and summer ((p > 0.05). With respect to the reference species (Anas crecca), critical differences in species fluctuation were observed among species (p < 0.001). Consequently, the findings of the present study suggest that seasonal factor might be of the substantial factors linked to the habitat composition. However, more descriptive and predictive analytical methods are needed beyond classical regression approaches in habitat use and selection studies at bird ecology.

Trophic structure varied seasonally, including a structure consistent with strong consumer control (exploitation food chain) in spring and fall, and an unexpected structure in summer, characterized by a negative correlation between phytoplankton biomass and phosphorus. This structure was explained by accumulation of inedible phytoplankton (mainly cyanobacteria) at low P concentrations. Owing to a lack of apparent resource (P) control, P-management had no detectable effects on phytoplankton biomass. The trophic structures identified in the lake provides explanations for this lack of response to P-management and for the differences between the responses of the South Basin of Lake Lugano and other perialpine lakes. Based on the results, lake restoration practice would benefit from a greater understanding and an increased ability to predict trophic structure within and across lakes.

Contaminants in lesser and greater scaup staging on the lower great lakes	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The decrease and subsequent lack of recovery of the North American scaup population has increased concerns about contaminants acquired during migration. We collected 189 fall- and spring-migrant lesser (Aythya affinis) and greater scaup (A. marila) on the lower Great Lakes (LGL) to determine if organic contaminants and trace elements in scaup livers were increased and to evaluate sources of variation in selenium (Se) burdens. We found that all organic contaminants were below toxic levels. Of 18 trace elements, only Se was detected at increased (> 10-ppm dry-mass) levels. Se in lesser scaup increased but remained constant in greater scaup throughout fall; levels were increased in 14% of lesser scaup and 46% of greater scaup. During spring, Se increased in lesser scaup but decreased slightly in greater scaup; levels were increased in 75% of lesser scaup and 93% of greater scaup. We suggest that Se may be problematic for some breeding female scaup after departing the LGL, but more research is needed to determine the extent to which it affects scaup demographics.																			0090-4341					MAY	2007	52	4					580	589		10.1007/s00244-006-0110-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-006-0110-7								17253099					WOS:000245817300017
J	Huber, V; Adrian, R; Gerten, D				Huber, Veronika; Adrian, Rita; Gerten, Dieter			A matter of timing: heat wave impact on crustacean zooplankton	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Climate change has affected zooplankton phenology and abundance in many freshwater ecosystems. The strong temperature anomalies that characterise summer heat waves make these events particularly suitable to study the effects of different seasonal warming patterns on zooplankton. Since heat waves are expected to occur more frequently under continuing climate change, they may also allow us to investigate how freshwater systems will be affected in the future. 2. Using a long-term data set (1991-2007) from a shallow, eutrophic lake in Germany, we identify time periods in spring and summer during which cyclopoid copepods and bosminids are particularly sensitive to changes in water temperature. Based on this knowledge, we consider why summer populations responded differently to recent heat wave events that occurred at different times in the season. 3. Linear regressions of moving averages suggested that water temperatures shortly before and shortly after the clear-water phase (CWP) were crucial for summer development of bosminids and cyclopoid copepods, respectively. Algal food availability (diatoms and cryptophytes) in the first weeks after the CWP also strongly influenced the summer populations of the two zooplankton groups. 4. Inter-annual differences in water temperature during the critical time periods at least partly explained the contrasting responses of cyclopoid copepods and bosminids to heat wave events. 5. Our findings indicate that the zooplankton response to climate warming, particularly to heat wave events, is critically dependent on the temporal pattern of elevated water temperatures. Beyond that, we show that the summer zooplankton populations react to periods of warming in relation to events in the plankton annual cycle (such as the CWP in eutrophic lakes) rather than to warming at a fixed time in the season.

It is located in a region with intensive copper mining, which has been constantly contaminated with metals in the last few decades. Thus, we measured As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations in surface water samples, as well as, in liver of.ommon carp in three different seasons spring, summer, and autumn 2013. Furthermore, we also studied the carp response to the water quality by observing its hepatic morphological structure and measuring some biochemical parameters (LDH, ALAT, and ASAT activity). In general, metal concentrations in the water varied, but As, Cu and Ni were present in all the three seasons. Cu concentrations were above the maximum permissible levels set by law. Metal concentrations in the liver were significantly higher than in the water (p<0.05). In addition, we observed severe hepatic histological alterations, which included degenerative changes - granular degeneration, vacuolar degeneration, hydropic degeneration, and fatty degeneration; necrotic changes (necrobiosis) karyopyknosis, karyorrexis and karyolysis, and necrosis; and changes in the blood vessels - hyperemia in sinusoids and major blood vessels. We found that LDH activity was inhibited in the common carp liver from the Topolnitsa reservoir compared to the reference fish, but ALAT and ASAT activity was significantly increased compared to the reference. Based on our findings we consider that the metal-contaminated waters of the Topolnitsa reservoir lead to negative changes at tissue and cellular level in the fish organism, which include altered structure and impaired functions of the liver.

J	Szal, D; Gruca-Rokosz, R				Szal, Dorota; Gruca-Rokosz, Renata			Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane in Freshwater Sediments of Rzeszow Reservoir	WATER												The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is an important sink of methane that plays a significant role in global warming. However, evidence for the AOM in freshwater habitats is rare, especially in dam and weir (small-scale dam) reservoirs. Here, the AOM process was examined in freshwater sediments of a small-scale dam reservoir located in Rzeszow, SE Poland. The AOM rate was determined in the main experiment with the addition of the (CH4)-C-13 isotope marker (He+(CH4)-C-13). Sediments were collected three times: in spring (in May, 15 degrees C), in summer (in July, 20 degrees C) and in autumn (in September, 10 degrees C). Further analysis considers the impact on AOM rate of potential electron acceptors present in pore-water (NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, and Fe3+ ions). The work suggests that an AOM process does take place in the studied reservoir sediments, with this evidenced by the presence in the headspace of an increased (CO2)-C-13 concentration deemed to derive from (CH4)-C-13 oxidation. Rates of AOM noted were of 0.36-1.42 nmol.g(-1).h(-1), with the most intensive oxidation in each sediment layer occurring at 20 degrees C. While none of the potential electron acceptors considered individually were found to have had a statistically significant influence on the AOM rate, their significance to the dynamics of the AOM process was not precluded.

This study investigates the influence of sea breeze (SB) propagation on the development of the urban boundary layer (UBL) in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), Brazil, an urban area with complex topography. This investigation is undertaken observationally by analyzing surface and upper air observations conducted in 2013 during the MCITY BRAZIL Project field campaigns and is conducted numerically by performing a set of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations. The observational analysis highlights two SB events in the MRSP, one in February (austral summer) and the other in August (winter). In both seasons, the passage of the SB front disrupts the convective growth of the UBL and establishes a thermal internal boundary layer, thereby reducing the UBL height. The cooling also momentarily disrupts the UHI circulation. The results indicate that topography enhances SB propagation because it helps the marine air to go up the MRSP coastal escarpment and to reach the plateau while forcing adiabatic cooling of this air, intensifying the thermal gradient between the southern part of the plateau and the urban area. The UHI further increases the thermal gradient (from 0.5 K to 2 K in summer and 1 to 2.5 K in winter), accelerating the SB propagation. Synoptic conditions determine whether the SB front reaches the urban area and also may displace the convergence center of the UHI circulation.

Among synthesized substances we found isopentenyladenine (2iP, i(6)Ade), zeatin (Z, io(2)Ade) and zeatin riboside (ZR, io(6)A). No trace of isopentenyladenosine (2iPA, i(6)A) was detected. The amounts of cyrokinin-like substances produced converted into 1 g dry mass of bacteria were as follows: 9.97 - 21.59 mug for isopentenyladenine; 3.08 - 35.08 mug for zeatin, and 0.35 - 18.69 mug for zeatin riboside. Various taxonomic groups of bacteria were capable of synthesising those compounds, such as Vibrio, Bacillus, Aeromonas, Achromobacter genera and Enterobacteriaceae family. Among the analyzed bacteria it was only the strain of Achromobacter spp that produced two compounds at the same time (zeatin and zeatin riboside).																			1230-1485						2000	9	5					369	376																WOS:000165202300003

Rehabilitation work was carried out in 2020 with the resources of the State Hydraulic Works. The average depth of Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake was increased from 4 m to 8.5 m, and its surface area was increased from 86.000 m(2) to 230.000 m(2). Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake, located in Saray & ouml;n & uuml; district, provides water from underground sources at the bottom of the lake. These underground sources come from the gaps in the limestone in the lower parts of the lake. When looking at the geological map, it is thought that there is a connection between Bey & scedil;ehir Lake and Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake because the land has a calcareous structure. The changes in the water quality parameters of Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake in different periods were examined and spatially modeled using spline interpolation techniques with Arc GIS 10.3.1 program, one of the Geography Information Systems (GIS) software. In order to determine some water quality parameters of Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake, water samples were taken from eight different points representing the lake in 4 different periods (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). Seasonally in the water of Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake, water quality parameters such as pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Temperature, Chloride (Cl), Nitrite (NO2), Nitrate (NO3), Sulphate (SO4) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Suspended Solids (TSS), Boron (B) were investigated. As a result of the research, it was found that pH values varied between 7.77-8.42, EC: 268-470 mu S/cm, water temperature varied between 6.8-20 degrees C, Cl varied between 0.139 - 3.9 mg/L, NO2 varied between < 0 00-0.33 mg/L, NO3 varied between < 0.00 - 4.13 mg/L, SO4 varied between 0.057 - 18.4 mg/L, COD varied between 5-32, TSS: 0.60 - 31.8 and B varied between 0.05-0.093 mg/L. As a result of the study, it was seen that the water quality of Be & scedil;g & ouml;z Lake, which is the subject of the research, is class I and potable water quality.

Central America and northernmost South America during Northern Hemisphere summer. The enhanced onshore flow that brings precipitation into Central America is caused by a northward displacement of the inter-tropical convergence zone, driven by cooling of the equatorial and warming of the northern subtropical and mid-latitude ocean. Ocean feedbacks also enhance precipitation over the American Southwest, although the increase in monsoon precipitation there is largely driven by increases in land-surface temperature. The northward shift in the equatorial precipitation band that causes enhanced precipitation in Central America and the American Southwest has a negative feedback effect on monsoonal precipitation in northern South America. The simulations demonstrate that mid-Holocene aridity in the mid-continent of North America is dynamically linked to the orbitally induced enhancement of the summer monsoon in the American Southwest, with a spatial structure (wet in the Southwest and dry in the mid-continent) similar to that found in strong monsoon years today. Changes in winter precipitation along the west coast of North America, in Central America and along the Gulf Coast, caused by southward-displacement of the westerly storm tracks, indicate that changes in the Northern Hemisphere winter monsoon also play a role in regional climate changes during the mid-Holocene. Although the simulations with FOAM and CSM differ in detail, the general mechanisms and patterns are common to both. The model results thus provide a coherent dynamical explanation for regional patterns of increased or decreased aridity shown by vegetation, lake status and aeolian data from the Americas.

The Whitson River watershed is a mixed land-use Precambrian shield watershed located in Northeastern Ontario, Canada in which groundwater is a source of municipal water supply and in which groundwater and surface waters are at risk of potential impacts from urban runoff, ongoing municipal drainage projects, periodic flooding, and climate change. This study used watershed-scale synoptic surveys of stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and geochemistry, and corresponding mixing-model approaches (two-component and three-component) to quantify the seasonal and spatial variation in surface water, ambient, and urban groundwater contributions to streamflow. Multiple mixing models were generated based on isotope and geochemical source water identification, and the performance of these models was compared. Mixing-model analyses showed that groundwater contributes a critical, sustaining source to streamflow (> 50 % or more) during summer baseflow conditions, dropping to similar to 15 % in fall when connection to shield lakes and wetlands dominate. Three-component mixing models showed similar results to the two-component models, refining groundwater contributions into ambient and urban groundwater sources. Estimated urban groundwater contributed 30 % or more to summer baseflow, dropping to similar to 4 % in the fall. Baseflow estimates derived from graphical hydrograph separation were similar to mixing model groundwater estimates in the summer but suggest this approach overestimates groundwater contributions during the fall. These results demonstrate the complexity of source water contributions to streamflow and the challenges in their determination in mixed-land-use Precambrian Shield landscapes where communities are largely located. Assessment of source water contributions to streamflow across the Whitson River sub-watershed has generated a region-specific conceptualization (e.g. urban versus ambient groundwater) of a basin that is experiencing increased urban development, providing information that will be of value for long term management.					; Macrae, Merrin/KPB-7902-2024	Goel, Pradeep/0000-0002-0695-5321; Macrae, Merrin/0000-0003-3296-3103; Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215; Zhang, Helen/0000-0002-2790-6588													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2024	644								132048	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132048		SEP 2024											WOS:001327429900001

Reservoir diffusive emissions were (1) measured in situ during field campaigns using a floating chamber, and (2) calculated from gas concentration measurements using the Thin Boundary Layer equation. Reservoir diffusive (surface) emissions and downstream degassing emissions were also estimated from continuous measurements of gas concentration at the electricity generating station. Diffusive CO2 and CH4 emissions from EM1 reservoir were highest during the first year after impoundment (2006) and decreased over the following years. Diffusive CO2 emissions from the reservoir surface and downstream degassing emissions were higher in spring following the winter CO2 buildup under the ice cover, whereas reservoir diffusive CH4 emissions and downstream degassing emissions were higher during summer, when water temperature was at its maximum. Most of the reservoir emissions occur in the form of CO2 (>98%, reservoir surface and downstream emissions), with CH4 emissions (diffusive, degassing) representing <2% of total annual CO2 equivalent emissions.																			2044-2041	2044-205X					2011	1	2					113	123		10.5268/IW-1.2.349	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-1.2.349													WOS:000307720900006
J	Melack, JM; Jellison, R				Melack, JM; Jellison, R			Limnological conditions in Mono Lake: contrasting monomixis and meromixis in the 1990s	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Mono Lake is a large, saline lake, located in the North American Great Basin and is subject to large variations in freshwater inflow as climatic conditions and diversion schemes have changed; consequently, major variations in chemical stratification occur. A transition from monomixis to meromixis occurred from 1994 to 1995. Lake-wide surveys of temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium and chlorophyll profiles, Secchi depth and light attenuation, and Artemia monica abundances conducted throughout 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 document the contrasts between monomixis and meromixis. During the monomictic conditions in 1993 and 1994, the lake thermally stratified in March and mixed to the bottom by December, the hypolimnion became anoxic in late March and the water column was oxygenated to the bottom by December. During meromictic conditions in 1995, 1996 and 1997, the absence of holomixis during winter resulted in persistent anoxic conditions beneath the chemocline, an accumulation of ammonium in the monimolimnion and depletion in the mixolimnion, and low mixolimnetic chlorophyll concentrations in the spring and autumn. A comparison of the density differences between 2 and 28 m due to thermal versus chemical stratification indicated thermal stratification predominated in 1993 and 1994, while in 1995, 1996 and 1997 chemical stratification dominated the density differences. Ammonium, the limiting nutrient in Mono Lake, was lower in the upper mixed layer throughout 1996 and 1997 compared to the monomictic years, 1993 and 1994. During 1996 and 1997, the annual maxima in Secchi depths were among the deepest observed during the past 19 years, and reflected the lower phytoplankton abundance caused by decreased availability of nitrogen as a result of strong chemical stratification and the absence of a period of holomixis. In both 1996 and 1997, maturation of the spring generation of Artemia was slowed, peak abundance of the first generation of adult Artemia was a month later and percent ovigery, fecundity, and body size were reduced as compared to 1993 and 1994.

Daytime optical turbulence and wind speed distributions at the Baikal Astrophysical Observatory	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY												Atmospheric turbulence limits the angular resolution of ground-based optical telescopes. The daytime turbulence conditions for solar observations are stronger and more complicated than the turbulence observed at night. The Baikal Astrophysical Observatory is the site of the 1-m Large Solar Vacuum Telescope (LSVT) located near Lake Baikal (East Siberia, Russia), which is the largest freshwater lake in the world. The region hosts unique weather regimes and natural phenomena, including local winds and giant ice rings. Because the LSVT has ongoing and planned programmes in adaptive optics (AO), statistical knowledge of atmospheric turbulence and wind speed distributions is essential for designing and optimizing AO systems. We present the first seasonal study of the vertical distribution of wind speed and daytime optical turbulence conditions at the Baikal Astrophysical Observatory. Site measurements of the daytime Fried parameter were collected using the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor in the LSVT AO system. Reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Centers for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) were used to characterize the wind speed distribution. The results demonstrate seasonal variation in both solar seeing and wind speed profile. The strongest wind speed was detected in winter and in November, while the weakest wind speed occurred during summer. The strongest daytime turbulence conditions were observed in the winter. The best solar seeing beta(0) approximate to 1 arcsec was detected in the summer.

In this study, use survival strategies of phytoplankton functional groups to environmental factors in a drinking water reservoir. Survival strategies of phytoplankton in drinking water reservoirs were rarely analysed. Dynamics and survival strategies of phytoplankton community in Zhushuqiao Reservoir (Changsha, China) were studied bimonthly from April 2016 to February 2017 to fill this gap. In spring, species of CRS-strategy that adapted to low water temperature, light, and nutrient dominated. There were small individuals of opportunistic colonists of C-strategy observed before stratification. With the increase of nutrient and water temperature in summer, slightly bigger, disturbance-tolerant species of R-strategy and species of CS-strategy that adapted to stratification dominated. In winter, some species adapted to low water temperature, which were R-strategists. Key factors driven seasonal phytoplankton succession were water temperature, total phosphorus, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Attention should be paid to potential threats from algal bloom species with C-strategy, and future longer-term monitoring of the system and its surrounding watersheds is greatly needed.

J	Weber, SL; Oerlemans, J				Weber, SL; Oerlemans, J			Holocene glacier variability: three case studies using an intermediate-complexity climate model	HOLOCENE					11th Meeting of the European-Union-of-Geosciences (EUG)	APR   12, 2001	STRASBOURG, FRANCE	European Union Geosci				Synthetic glacier length records are generated for the Holocene epoch using a process-based glacier model coupled to the intermediate-complexity climate model ECBilt. The glacier model consists of a mass-balance component and an ice-flow component. The climate model is forced by the insolation change due to variations in the Earth's orbital parameters. We consider three glaciers, ranging from maritime to continental. At Nigardsbreen (southern Norway), the simulated long-term trend in the annual mass-balance is primarily determined by summer temperature, with a smaller contribution from winter precipitation. In the early Holocene, summers were warmer and winters wetter than today in the ECBilt simulation. Both signals seem consistent with proxy data. The simulated glacier length shows a phase of rapid expansion during the mid-Holocene, followed by more gradual growth. At Rhonegletscher (the Swiss Alps), ECBilt simulates warmer and wetter summers in the early Holocene. The temperature signal seems realistic, but proxy data and earlier modelling results are not conclusive with respect to the precipitation signal. The implied glacier length shows a maximum extent at 3-5 kyr BP, which seems unlikely. This suggests that the simulated precipitation response is not realistic. The simulated early-Holocene climate at Abramov glacier (Kirghizia) is characterized by high summer precipitation, associated with a northward extension of the Asian monsoon, The precipitation signal reaches its maximum around 6 kyr BP, which is consistent with the timing of the maximum in lake-level data, The simulated glacier length shows a pronounced postglacial maximum at the time of maximum monsoon intensity. There is considerable centennial-timescale variability in the simulated glacier length records. These length variations are generated by internal climatic variability. They are typically asynchronous among the three different glaciers. ECBilt has reasonable skill in simulating the relative importance of temperature and precipitation as well as the seasonality of the forcing, although the overall level of variability is underestimated. Length variations are shown to behave as a tagged moving-average process, with a glacier-specific memory.

Fossil analyses inferred that Qu'Appelle lakes are naturally productive but that invertebrate communities were altered by agriculture and urbanization. In western lakes, rates of community change (chord distance per 5 yr) were low and nonsignificant (P > 0.05) prior to European Settlement, but increased twofold after similar to 1930-1940. In contrast, uniformly significant rates Of community change were recorded in eastern downstream lakes only after the 1960s. In both cases, high rates of change corresponded to alterations in the balance between deep-water (Chironomus) and littoral species (Cladotanytarsus mancus group. Tanytarsus [s.l.]). Comparison of historical and fossil time series (similar to 1920-1993) using variance partitioning analysis (VPA) explained up to 86.6% of past variations in chironomid community composition. Unexpectedly, climate (winter temperature) explained a significant (P < 0.05) and substantial (mean +/- SD n = 8. 24.8 +/- 21.9%) amount of community variance at all sites except Round Lake. In contrast, land-use practices exhibited Significant but less substantial (6.7 +/- 6.1%, n = 8) impacts on zoobenthos of five lakes, whereas significant urban impacts (3.6 +/- 7.5%, n = 8) were recorded only at two sites. Similarly, redundancy analysis showed that minimum winter or spring temperature significantly influenced the relative abundance of littoral taxa in seven lakes. Such strong effects of climate on benthic invertebrate communities contrast its weak effects on phytoplankton in these lakes and suggest that future environmental change may be expressed differentially among habitats.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2002	47	2					378	391		10.4319/lo.2002.47.2.0378	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2002.47.2.0378													WOS:000174751100005

The effects of wind and fuel stores on stopover departure behavior across a migratory barrier	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												During annual migrations between breeding and nonbreeding grounds, billions of land birds encounter migratory barriers en route. Although birds are thought to be more selective (i.e., cross under favorable wind conditions) and spend more time refueling at stopover sites when confronted with these barriers, there is no direct evidence to support these hypotheses. Using 2 automated radio-telemetry arrays at stopover sites situated before (south of) and after (north of) a large ecological barrier (Lake Erie), we tracked departure decisions of American redstarts Setophaga ruticilla and yellow-rumped (myrtle) warblers Setophaga coronata coronata during spring migration. We found evidence that condition, age, and tailwind assistance were all positively correlated with the likelihood of departure. Interestingly, these patterns did not differ between species, with presumably differing migratory tactics, nor across sites, suggesting that during spring migration, migratory songbirds may follow general rules for departure from stopover sites, despite varying ecological and life-history contexts.

To explore the seasonal variations and spatial distributions exhibited by nutrients in the water column, surface sediment, and pore water of Lake Yangcheng and its major tributaries, we determined the concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) throughout the lake in different seasons of 2018. Total N (TN) and total P (TP) concentrations in the connected rivers were much greater than those in the lake, indicating that external loading greatly contributed to the nutrient enrichment. TN concentration in the water column was highest in the winter, whereas TP peaked in the summer. A similar temporal pattern was observed for TN and TP in the sediment with maxima in the winter and minima in the summer; however, nutrients in the pore water were highest in the summer, in contrast to the temporal variation in the sediment. Additionally, high TN values in the water column and high TP in the three compartments were distributed primarily in the west part of the lake, while high TN concentrations in the sediment and pore water were observed mainly in the east portion of the lake. According to the enrichment factor index (an indicator evaluating the nutrient enrichment by comparing the detected contents and standard values), nutrients in the lake sediment were severely enriched with TN and TP averaging 2195.8 mg/kg and 543.0 mg/kg, respectively. The vertical distribution of TN and TP generally exhibited similar decreasing patterns with an increase in sediment depth, suggesting mineralization of TN and TP by microbes and benthic organisms. More attention and research are needed to understand the seasonality of nutrient exchange across the sediment-water interface, especially in eutrophic lakes.

J	LaZerte, BD; Scott, L				LaZerte, BD; Scott, L			Soil water leachate from two forested catchments on the Precambrian Shield, Ontario	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												A predominantly coniferous catchment on the Precambrian Shield had significantly more acid, base-poor, and Al-rich soil solutions than a predominantly deciduous catchment. Eight-year median depth profiles of the forest floor solutions revealed that ceramic tension lysimeters collected significantly higher levels of Al and Si, lower amounts of NO3-, and equal amounts of dissolved organic carbon than plastic zero-tension lysimeters. There was no significant difference between lysimeter types in the deeper mineral soils. NO3-, NH4+, K+, organic C, organic Al, Fe, and to a lesser extent Ca2+ and Mg2+ were more abundant in forest floor solutions than in the mineral soils. Inorganic Al, F-, Na+, and SO42- were more abundant in the mineral horizons, and Cl- was uniform throughout the profile. Calculations based on the Na profile and the weathering of plagioclase feldspars suggested that secondary Al and Si minerals were accumulating in the mineral soil. Long-term median inorganic Al concentrations followed the microcrystalline gibbsite solubility curve (-log(Al3+) = -9.2 + 3.0(pH); R(2) = 0.97), and F- was closely correlated (R(2) = 0.7). NO3-, NH4+, and K+ in the forest floor exhibited the strongest seasonal patterns, with peaks during the winter-spring snowmelt and late summer. Their levels increased severalfold in response to summer drought, but there was little response in the lower horizons. Apparently because of a decline in SO42- and possibly Ca2+ deposition, there was a long-term decline in Ca2+ and SO42- in the stream draining the PCl mineral horizons (approximately -2.1 +/- 0.4 mu equiv. L(-1). year(-1)), and a similar Ca2+ decline in the mineral soil solutions themselves. However, there was no change in pH or inorganic Al levels.																			0045-5067					AUG	1996	26	8					1353	1365		10.1139/x26-151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x26-151													WOS:A1996VF70100005

A total of 28 water quality parameters were seasonally monitored at 33 sampling sites in the GBSL during 2016 to 2017 (i.e., 132 water samples were collected in four seasons). The results indicated that: 1) spatially, the western and south-western GBSL was relatively more eutrophic and polluted with heavy metals; and 2) temporally, the lakes suffered from high risks of heavy metal contamination in spring, but eutrophication in summer while water quality in winter was the best among the four seasons. Two main potential sources of pollution and transport routes were identified and discussed based on the pollution patterns. These findings contributed considerably to providing in-depth understanding of water pollution patterns, as well as potential pollution sources in the water-supplying region. Such understanding is crucial for developing pollution control and management strategies for this mega inter-basin water transfer project. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objectives of this study were to (1) describe concentrations of, and correlations among, inorganic contaminants in a sample of autumn migrant red-necked grebes from the Great Lakes, (2) compare concentrations of inorganic contaminants to those in autumn migrant common loons from Schummer et al. (Arch Environ Contam Toxicol 62:704, 2011a), (3) evaluate if the inorganic elements are negatively associated with lipid and protein reserves, and (4) determine if nutrient reserves and molt intensity were correlated. None of the 14 contaminants analyzed were above threshold levels known to cause acute health problems in piscivorous birds. Body masses of plucked birds were within the normal reported range. Lipid reserves varied positively with hepatic concentrations of arsenic, copper, iron, nickel, lead, and selenium and negatively with mercury and magnesium. Protein reserves variety negatively with hepatic concentrations of arsenic, calcium, nickel, lead, and zinc and positively with aluminum, cadmium, and iron. A negative correlation was observed between chest molt and lipid reserves but not between nutrient reserves and other feather tracts. The relationships between lipid reserves and both mercury and selenium were consistent with current research on other piscivorous waterbirds at the Great Lakes and justify continued work to determine interactions of these contaminants in waterbirds that breed, stage, and winter in the region.					chen, yuwei/U-9491-2017; Belzile, Nelson/J-4607-2019; Schummer, Michael/FDB-4240-2022														0090-4341	1432-0703				NOV	2015	69	4					399	410		10.1007/s00244-015-0200-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-015-0200-5								26250452					WOS:000362666700003
J	Bielec, G; Józwiak, N				Bielec, Grzegorz; Jozwiak, Natalia			The Influence of Winter Swimming on Blood Pressure in Middle-Aged Women	ACTA BALNEOLOGICA												Introduction: For many years, winter baths have attracted an increasing number of participants. The results of various research indicate the increase of immunity and enhancement of anti-oxidative response in winter swimmers. The relationship between winter bathing and blood pressure variation is not thoroughly explored. Aim: The aim of the study was the evaluation of blood pressure variation in middle-aged women attending regularly in winter swimming. Material and Methods: The study was conducted in a group of twenty five healthy women in age range 17-63 years (mean 39.9 years), who regularly participated in lake swims between October and April. The first examination was taken in December 2018, the second one in April 2019. Duration of each immersion in the water was 4 minutes, water temperature was below 4 degrees C. Blood pressure was measured before the immersion and immediately after getting out of the water. Body temperature was assessed before and after the swim. Control group consisted of 25 women of similar age who never practiced winter swimming. Results: In intervention group systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased essentially after each immersion in cold water. Decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed on spring, but these changes were not significant. Decrease of systolic blood pressure was noted in control group in April Conclusions: In intervention group no significant influence of winter swimming on blood pressure was discovered. Further studies, considering greater number of morphological and physiological variables are needed to confirm healthy impact of winter swimming on cardio-vascular system.

The research includes the evaluation of field and experimental studies at the Panjiakou Reservoir (between Aug and Oct 2009) and the review of international data covering two decades. The results indicated that typical eutrophic non-aquaculture water had mean concentrations of chlorophyll a of higher than 10 mu g L-1, and significant positive correlations were found between pH, DO and chlorophyll a. When the mean concentration of chlorophyll a was less than 10 mu g L-1, no correlation was found between DO and chlorophyll a for waters with a high exchange rate or heavily organically polluted natural waters. Diurnal variations were found for both pH and DO. A corresponding significant positive correlation was found between both water quality parameters. In general, when the mean concentration of chlorophyll a was less than 10 mu g L-1 within aquaculture waters of low exchange rate, only a weak or no correlation at all was found between pH, DO and chlorophyll a during summer and autumn. On the other hand, a significant positive correlation between pH and chlorophyll a and a significant positive correlation or no correlation between DO and chlorophyll a were found for aquaculture waters with a high exchange rate during summer and autumn. Strong diurnal variations for both pH and DO were identified. A significant positive linear correlation between pH and DO was found for field enclosure experiments.

Pipistrellus nathusii is much more frequent in autumn and late summer (about 85% of all records) than in other seasons. Therefore it is supposed, that this species is normally migratory in southwest Germany and hibernates there only seldom, but more in southern countries (e.g. France). It could be shown that Nathusius'' pipistrelle arrives 10 days earlier at the north eastern part of Baden-Wuerttemberg than at Lake Konstanz and about four weeks earlier than at the Regio Basiliensis. A possible migration route is discussed.					Bastian/AAI-5742-2020														0044-3468					AUG	1988	53	4					202	209																WOS:A1988P814900002

However, it is not always trivial to disentangle past changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation from possible changes in evaporative enrichment, and seasonality may need to be considered. Here, we analyzed delta H-2 on n-alkanes and delta O-18 on hemicellulose sugars in sediments from Bichlersee, Bavaria, covering the Late Glacial and Early Holocene. Our delta H-2(n-C31) record documents past changes in the isotopic composition of summer precipitation and roughly shows the isotope pattern known from Greenland. Both records show lower values during the Younger Dryas, but at Bichlersee the signal is less pronounced, corroborating earlier suggestions that the Younger Dryas was mainly a winter phenomenon and less extreme during summer. delta O-18(fucose) records the isotopic composition of the lake water during summer and is sensitive to evaporative enrichment. Coupling delta H-2(n-C31) and delta O-18(fucose) allows calculating lake water deuterium-excess and thus disentangling changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation and evaporative enrichment. Our deuterium-excess record reveals that the warm Bolling-Allerod and Early Holocene were characterized by more evaporative enrichment compared to the colder Younger Dryas. Site-specific hydrological conditions, seasonality, and coupling delta H-2 and delta O-18 are thus important when interpreting isotope records.					; Szidat, Sönke/D-6706-2011; Struck, Julian/I-8882-2017; Acharya, Sudip/MQY-8335-2025; Zech, Michael/F-8026-2018	Prochnow, Maximilian/0009-0003-6043-4783; Zech, Michael/0000-0002-9586-0390													2045-2322					OCT 28	2023	13	1							18487	10.1038/s41598-023-45754-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45754-4								37898674					WOS:001093350900054

J	INGRI, J; WIDERLUND, A				INGRI, J; WIDERLUND, A			UPTAKE OF ALKALI AND ALKALINE-EARTH ELEMENTS ON SUSPENDED IRON AND MANGANESE IN THE KALIX RIVER, NORTHERN SWEDEN	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Scavenging of alkali and alkaline-earth elements by suspended Fe and Mn in the Kalix River, northern Sweden, has been studied for a period of seventeen months. More than 95% (by weight) of suspended nondetrital concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Sr are scavenged on suspended nondetrital Fe throughout all seasons. Barium is correlated to suspended Fe during winter, but during the summer a significant fraction of nondetrital Ba is associated with Mn-rich particles. Porewater profiles for Ca, Mg, and Sr are similar to the dissolved Fe profile, suggesting desorption from a Fe-rich carrier phase. Compared with the river water concentration, Ba is enriched twenty-five times in porewater and shows, together with Mn, a post-depositional subsurface maximum in the solid sediment. The alkali elements Na and K show a linear correlation to suspended nondetrital Fe during the winter. However, the summer concentrations cannot be explained by scavenging onto Fe alone, and sediment and porewater data show no clear association with Fe or Mn. The distribution coefficients for the alkaline-earth elements are two orders of magnitude larger than coefficients obtained for model Fe-oxyhydroxides. This suggests that surface complexation occurs via other functional groups and/or the alkaline-earths are more firmly bound to the natural Fe-rich phase.																			0016-7037					DEC	1994	58	24					5433	5442		10.1016/0016-7037(94)90240-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90240-2													WOS:A1994PY69300005
J	Brosse, S; Grossman, GD; Lek, S				Brosse, Sebastien; Grossman, Gary D.; Lek, Sovan			Fish assemblage patterns in the littoral zone of a European reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Although reservoirs are common aquatic habitats in Europe, there is little quantitative information on the spatial organisation of fish assemblages inhabiting their littoral zones. Consequently, we characterised fish assemblage structure in the littoral zone of a reservoir (Lake Pareloup) in SW France during late spring, summer and early autumn (the growing season). 2. We measured the relative abundance of fish weekly, from mid-May to mid-October, using point abundance sampling by electrofishing. We identified temporal patterns in assemblage structure using hierarchical cluster analysis, and then characterised the spatial distribution of 17 defined ecospecies using a Kohonen self-organising map (SOM, an unsupervised Artificial Neural Network). 3. Our analyses revealed three distinct faunal structures within the littoral zone. From mid-May to mid-July, adults and young-of-the-year (0+) occupied separate habitats, with most 0+ fish in vegetated habitats and adults in open water. From mid-July to late August, some 0+ co-occurred with adults, but most 0+ fishes remained in vegetated areas. Finally, from late August to mid-October, most fish (both 0+ and adults) left the vegetation for unvegetated littoral habitats, the exception being fish species known to be dependent on macrophytes. 4. Contrary to patterns for adult fishes, the 0+ fish assemblage was dynamic. These dynamics were driven by ontogenetic species-specific habitat changes. Consequently, there was little evidence of stable assemblages or strong assemblage-habitat relationships that would be expected of an 'interactive' assemblage. It is likely that the patterns observed are a result of species-specific response to habitat availability in the lake.

We used the size-exclusion assay method (SEAM), a cultivation-based approach that simply and effectively isolates typical freshwater bacterioplankton. The specific clusters detected in the winter samples were the Rhodoferax sp. BAL47 cluster (LimA and LimC), a predominant and ubiquitous freshwater lineage, and the LiUU-5-340 cluster. To confirm tolerance to low water temperature of winter-specific groups, we also compared growth rates at 5A degrees C among several pure strains of typical freshwater bacterioplankton clusters belonging to the Rhodoferax sp. BAL47, Polynucleobacter necessarius, GKS98, LiUU-5-340, and IRD18C08 of the class Betaproteobacteria, and the Luna-1 and Luna-2 of the class Actinobacteria. Specific detectability of freshwater bacterioplankton clusters/subclusters by SEAM in the winter sample substantially correlated with the low temperature-specific growth characteristics of each isolate. Response to water temperature is a key control factor in freshwater bacterioplankton assemblage composition. These results provide important insights into the specific response to water temperature of several ubiquitous culturable freshwater bacterioplankton clusters inhabiting a temperate climate zone.

Determination of water quality variables, endotoxin concentration, and Enterobacteriaceae concentration and identification in southern High Plains dairy lagoons	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												The objectives of this study were to determine the concentration of endotoxin, determine 20 water quality variables, and identify and enumerate fungal and bacterial pathogens from United States southern High Plains dairy lagoons and control lakes during summer and winter. Water samples were collected in triplicate from the north, south, east, and west quadrants of each body of water. The mean (+/- SEM) winter dairy lagoon endotoxin concentration was significantly higher (9,678 +/- 1,834 ng/mL) than the summer concentration (3,220 +/- 810 ng/mL). The mean endotoxin concentration of the 2 control lakes (summer: 58.1 +/- 8.8 ng/mL; winter: 38.6 +/- 4.2 ng/mL) was significantly less than that of the dairy lagoons. Two hundred-one Salmonella enterica spp. isolates were identified, 7 serovars were recovered from the dairy lagoons, and 259 Salmonella ssp. were identified from 5 other dairy locations (milk barn, ditch effluent, settling basin, feed alley pad flush, and center pivots). Twenty-eight Salmonella spp. were identified from center pivot water. Escherichia coli O157:H7 pathogens were isolated from other dairy locations but not from lagoons. Neither Salmonella spp. nor E. coli 0157:H7 were identified from control lakes. Enterobacteriaceae opportunistic pathogens were isolated from both dairies and control lakes. Important mesophilic and thermophilic catabolic (to manure biosolids) fungal isolates were identified from dairy effluent locations, but no thermophilic fungal isolates were cultured from the control lakes. Adequate curing of green forage following center pivot irrigation is important to kill lagoon water enteric pathogens, even though the lagoon water is mixed with fresh water. Recirculating lagoon water to flush the feed alley pad, where cows stand while eating, to remove manure and using lagoon water to abate dairy dust in loafing pens and unimproved dairy roads is inconsistent with good environmental practice management.																			0022-0302	1525-3198				APR	2010	93	4					1511	1522		10.3168/jds.2009-2497	http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-2497								20338428					WOS:000275867200021

Groundwater dye tracing in central Missouri utilizing a multi-sensor fluorometer deployed in Hahatonka Spring	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												In the fall of 2009 and spring of 2010, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources Division of Geology and Land Survey's Geological Survey Program (GSP) conducted an investigation to further delineate the groundwater recharge area of Hahatonka Spring at Lake of the Ozarks in central Missouri. The goal of the study was to determine the hydrologic connections of the karst system near the town of Montreal in Camden County, Missouri, to Hahatonka Spring utilizing fluorescent dye tracing techniques. Conventional charcoal receptor packets and spectro-fluorometric analysis were used in conjunction with a newly acquired multi-sensor submersible fluorometer. The primary purpose of the groundwater investigation was to assess the durability and capability of the fluorometer to continuously monitor for multiple fluorescent tracers and water quality parameters during an extended deployment. Camden County is located in central Missouri where considerable karst development has occurred from the dissolution of the underlying Ordovician Roubidoux Formation and Gasconade Dolomite. The terrain is characterized by sinkholes, losing streams, caves, and springs. The major source of discrete groundwater recharge in the area is from losing streams and, to a lesser extent, sinkholes. A hydrologic connection has been established using water tracing methods at Lancaster Road sinkhole in Laclede County to Hahatonka Spring (Vandike 1992). The travel time of the dye peak concentration, including the arrival of the leading edge and elapsed time of the trailing edge of the dye to Hahatonka Spring was delineated by the fluorometer using 4-h data collection intervals. Groundwater velocity was calculated from the resulting data and determined to be 3.1 km per day (1.98 miles per day). The fluorometer also shows relations in the data among long-term natural fluxes of spring discharge, temperature, and turbidity.																			0891-2556					MAY	2013	28	1-2			SI		159	165		10.1007/s13146-013-0131-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-013-0131-z													WOS:000317969600020

Out of oxygen: Stratification and loading drove hypoxia during a warm, wet, and productive year in a Great Lakes estuary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Hypolimnetic hypoxia, or low oxygen in bottom waters, impairs ecosystem services of freshwater lakes and estuaries globally. Both hypoxia incidence and intensity are increasing around the world due to eutrophication and climate change. As the hypolimnion becomes hypoxic and ultimately anoxic, sediment-bound legacy phosphorus is released. Water column mixing due to large storm events or fall turnover entrains these nutrients to the surface, causing harmful algal blooms. To assess the dynamics of hypoxia throughout the growing season, we evaluated Muskegon Lake, where hypoxia recurs annually, utilizing high-frequency time-series data from the Muskegon Lake Observatory (MLO) buoy (https:// www.gvsu.edu/wri/buoy/), biweekly nutrient sampling, and seasonal respiration experiments during 2021. While water-column stratification set the stage for hypolimnetic hypoxia, frequent wind-mixing events, and episodic intrusions of cold, oxygenated, upwelled Lake Michigan waters intermittently reduced the thickness or intensity of the hypoxic zone. Respiration experiments revealed that riverine and surface organic matter inputs contributed most to hypolimnetic hypoxia in the spring, whereas sur-face inputs did so during summer, and riverine inputs during fall, indicating seasonally variable sources drive hypoxia. Biweekly measurements indicated increased soluble reactive phosphorus in the hypolim-nion during anoxia via internal phosphorus loading from the sediment with the potential for fueling sur-face blooms with net export of soluble reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus to nearshore Lake Michigan. Our findings on the role of seasonally changing temperature, loading, phytoplankton produc-tion, hypolimnetic respiration, and internal phosphorus loading in shaping hypoxia dynamics have rele-vance to similarly afflicted ecosystems in the Great Lakes Basin.

Among the energy consumption of buildings, air conditioning energy consumption occupies a major proportion, about 2/3. Traditional air conditioning cooling mainly uses refrigerants such as Freon to circulate and cool under high temperature and high pressure, which not only has high energy consumption but also can cause the external environment temperature to be too high. River water source heat pump is a renewable energy technology that can use water bodies including groundwater, surface water such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs and oceans. This project mainly studies the operation strategy of related units using river water as the cold source in a chemical industrial park in Chongqing, from unit selection, establishment of energy consumption model to unit operation strategy analysis and research, to achieve the best state of energy utilization.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2024	319								100483	10.1016/j.dwt.2024.100483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dwt.2024.100483		JUN 2024											WOS:001257642400001

We evaluated the importance of reproduction and survival for seasonal population dynamics as well as the formation of a summer peak in population numbers. Yellow-necked mice started breeding earlier in the spring than did bank voles. However, early breeding and rapid increase in numbers of both species resulted in a particular seasonal distribution of pregnant female numbers indicative for delayed (even up to 40 days) maximum reproduction of yellow-necked mice as compared with that of bank voles. A high survival rate of mature females of the yellow-necked mouse preceeds the July peak in population numbers, and a low survival rate of immature individuals of this species contributes to a rapid decline of numbers following this peak. The survival rate of mature females of the bank vole does not affect the summer peak in population numbers of this species. A relatively high survival rate of immature individuals of bank voles following the summer peak results in a slow decrease of its population size.																			0003-455X	1797-2450				AUG	2008	45	4					248	254		10.5735/086.045.0402	http://dx.doi.org/10.5735/086.045.0402													WOS:000259566100003

A 2000 year record of climate variations reconstructed from Haukadalsvatn, West Iceland	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The sediment fill of Haukadalsvatn, a lake in northwest Iceland, preserves a record of environmental change since deglaciation, 13 ka ago. The rapid sedimentation rate over the past 2 ka (ca. 4 m ka(-1)) provides a high-resolution archive of late Holocene environmental change. Physical and chemical environmental proxies extracted from cores from the Haukadalsvatn sediment fill provide a reconstruction of sub-decadal-scale climate variability in Iceland over the past 2 ka. Over this interval biogenic silica (BSi) reflects warm April-May temperatures, whereas total organic carbon (TOC) peaks represent an increased flux of carbon to the lake from eolian-derived soil erosion following periods of cold summers accompanied by dry, windy winters. The proxy-based temperature reconstructions show a broad interval of warmth through Medieval times, but this warmth is punctuated by multi-decadal cold intervals. The transition into the Little Ice Age occurred in two steps, with initial summer cooling 1250-1300 AD, and a more severe drop in summer temperatures between 1450 and 1500 AD; both are periods of severe explosive volcanism. Multi-decadal patterns of cold and warm conditions have some characteristics of a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-like signal, but instrumental records and proxy-based reconstructions of the NAO index contain little power in the frequencies most strongly expressed in our data set. Although severe soil erosion in Iceland is frequently equated with settlement, our reconstructions indicate that soil erosion began several centuries before settlement, whereas for several centuries after settlement, when summer temperatures were relatively high, there was little or no soil erosion. Only during the transition into and during the Little Ice Age did soil erosion become a major feature of the record.

J	MARIN, LE; KRATZ, TK; BOWSER, CJ				MARIN, LE; KRATZ, TK; BOWSER, CJ			SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS IN THE HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY OF A POOR FEN IN NORTHERN WISCONSIN	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We studied the factors causing spatial and temporal patterning of interstitial water chemistry in Crystal Bog, a 7ha northern Wisconsin kettle-hole peatland. Over the course of the snow-free season Crystal Bog exhibited spatial and temporal patterns in chemistry, especially hydrogen-ion, dissolved organic carbon, and specific conductance. The peatland contains a 0.5 ha pond that has water more dilute than the interstitial water of the surrounding peatland. The direction of groundwater flow between the lake and the peatland was seasonally dependent. In the spring and early summer, flow was from the lake into the peatland, especially on the eastern side of the lake. This flow resulted in a plume of relatively dilute surface interstitial water in the peatland. In mid and late summer direction of groundwater flow was from the peatland into the lake and the dilute plume was reduced in areal extent. By fall the direction of water flow was again from the lake to the peatland. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity in water chemistry produced by the seasonal variation in the direction of horizontal water flow was substantial. Minimum and maximum observed concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the interstitial water of the peatland, for example, differed by more than a factor of three, and pH ranged between 3.8 and 5.0. Correlations of DOC with anion deficit and hydrogen ion concentration and experiments of photo-oxidation of water samples showed that organic acids were the primary cause of acidity in the peatland. Specific conductance was highly correlated with DOC, probably because of DOC''s correlation with the very conductive hydrogen ion. In Crystal Bog it was possible to use the relatively simple measure of specific conductance to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of the more difficult to determine DOC.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				SEP	1990	11	1					63	76																WOS:A1990DV85400004
J	de Azevedo, F; Bonecker, CC				de Azevedo, F; Bonecker, CC			Community size structure of zooplanktonic assemblages in three lakes on the upper River Parana floodplain, PR-MS, Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Abundance and body size of zooplanktonic organisms, testate amoebae, rotifers, cladocerans and copepods from the littoral and pelagic regions of three lakes were analyzed in February and August 2000. The lakes belong to three different river systems (Baia, Ivinhema and Parana rivers) of the upper River Parana floodplain. It was expected that average body size was different in space ( regions of the lake and limnological characteristics) and time ( summer and winter) because the variation of depth, pH, oxygen dissolved, chlorophyll-a and water temperature of each lake. Zooplankton community was represented by 119 species. Sorensen's coefficient showed that the three communities were similar. Larger organisms were found in the lakes' pelagic region, and seasonally larger individuals were registered in the winter and smaller individuals in the summer. The relationship between body size and density was slight, positively significant. The body size frequency distribution was bi-modal. ANOVA results showed a significant influence of the interaction of the littoral and pelagic regions, lakes, and seasons in the body size of zooplankton organisms. Spatial and temporal changes of the community size structure of zooplanktonic assemblages were related to the food resource (microbial-loop or herbivore chain), species habitat preference and life strategies ( growth and reproduction).

Effect of Climate Change on Soil Temperature in Swedish Boreal Forests	PLOS ONE												Complex non-linear relationships exist between air and soil temperature responses to climate change. Despite its influence on hydrological and biogeochemical processes, soil temperature has received less attention in climate impact studies. Here we present and apply an empirical soil temperature model to four forest sites along a climatic gradient of Sweden. Future air and soil temperature were projected using an ensemble of regional climate models. Annual average air and soil temperatures were projected to increase, but complex dynamics were projected on a seasonal scale. Future changes in winter soil temperature were strongly dependent on projected snow cover. At the northernmost site, winter soil temperatures changed very little due to insulating effects of snow cover but southern sites with little or no snow cover showed the largest projected winter soil warming. Projected soil warming was greatest in the spring (up to 4 degrees C) in the north, suggesting earlier snowmelt, extension of growing season length and possible northward shifts in the boreal biome. This showed that the projected effects of climate change on soil temperature in snow dominated regions are complex and general assumptions of future soil temperature responses to climate change based on air temperature alone are inadequate and should be avoided in boreal regions.

Spatial and Temporal Movements of White Sucker: Implications for Use as a Sentinel Species	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												White suckers Catostomus commersonii are widely distributed in rivers of North America and often used in environmental monitoring. The species' value as a sentinel has been questioned because some populations are known to travel long distances during spawning migrations and therefore can be exposed to multiple environments. The movements of white suckers in a 65-km reach of the Saint John River, New Brunswick, were studied from 2001 to 2003 using radio and acoustic tracking and analyses of stable isotope ratios. Individuals maintained small home ranges in the river from summer to late winter, averaging 2.6 river kilometers [rkm] or less each year. During the spring spawning season, upstream and downstream movements to three tributaries occurred. Distances traveled were up to 40 rkm and averaged 9.2 rkm (SD = 11.0). Two males used separate tributaries within a spawning period, and there was evidence that spawning may not take place every year. Stable isotope results confirmed that white suckers maintained a high fidelity to well-defined reaches in the main river outside the spawning period. These results indicate the importance of distinct, limited habitats and connectivity of habitats for white suckers in large rivers and support the hypothesis that white suckers reflect localized environmental conditions and can be used as a sentinel.

Comparative material was obtained from North Wales and southern Scotland. Comparisons were performed using otolith ages, meristic and morphological characters and by assessing allele frequencies for serum esterase and for skeletal muscle malate dehydrogenase. The results confirm that both basins of Windermere contain spring and autumn spawning races of Charr. As well as differing genetically and exhibiting differing growth rates, the two races have different mean gill raker numbers and mean gill raker lengths. The latter two variables were used to derive a discriminant function which enables length. The latter two variables wre used to derive a discriminant function which enables individual charr to be ascribed to the correct race with 94-96% accuracy. Within both principal races there were further significant differences between charr from the north and south basins of the lake and possibly also between different spawning grounds within each basin. Variation between six of the remaining seven Cumbrian populations is significant but generally no greater than that between the Windermere spring and autumn spawners. The exception is the Ennerdale charr which stands out on morphological, meristic and genetic characters, has a rapid growth rate despite its oligotrophic environment, and is a river rather than a lake spawner. The charr from North Wales and southern Scotland were clearly distinct, both from each other and from the English populations.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				NOV	1988	33	5					791	814		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1988.tb05524.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1988.tb05524.x													WOS:A1988Q926000014

Energy Density of Introduced Round Goby Compared with Four Native Fishes in a Lake Michigan Tributary	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The round goby Neogobius melanostomus is an invasive species that has changed Great Lakes food webs and become an important prey for many predators. We tested whether the round goby from a Lake Michigan tributary was energetically equivalent to four native fishes: mottled sculpin Cottus bairdii, johnny darter Etheostoma nigrum, bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus, and rock bass Ambloplites rupestris. We found positive linear relationships between energy density and the percent dry weight of a fish for each species. We also found evidence of temporal and spatial variation in round goby energy density. Energy density was lower in spring and summer than in fall. The spatial variation in energy density may be linked to the inclusion of the low-quality prey, dreissenid mussels, in the diets of larger round goby. For a given size, the johnny darter and bluntnose minnow had the highest energy density while mottled sculpin had the lowest. Our results show that the energy density of the round goby is intermediate to those of the four native fishes, suggesting that the round goby is an energetically average prey in a Lake Michigan tributary.

We used a long-term dataset (1985-2010) of TP concentrations and weather factors. A Thin Plate Spline (TPS) model was used to predict TP by year, by day of the year, and by geographical coordinates. Deviations between observed and predicted TP values (residuals, or TP anomalies) were related to the weather variables to clarify how the weather anomalies in a year might correlate with the observed fluctuations in TP dynamics. Notable seasonal variations in TP, typical for many shallow lake systems, were found: TP was two to three times higher during late summer-early autumn than during winter. Patterns of TP variability were well predicted by using geographical coordinates, year and day of the year (R-2=0.69; P<0.0001). However, TP anomalies were ascribed to the effects of T, L, PAR, and V, which were proved to play a significant additional role in TP dynamics. Moreover, L had consistently negative effects over the year, whereas the effects of T and PAR on TP change were seen to be dependent on the season. TP anomalies in Lake Peipsi were most sensitive to wind anomalies. V was associated with frequent switches between increasing and decreasing TP values, though it appeared mainly as a negative driver of TP anomalies in the season prior to the 180th day, and as a positive driver in the subsequent season.					; Kangur, Kulli/H-3631-2016	Tammeorg, Olga/0000-0002-7616-3127; Kangur, Kulli/0000-0003-2484-4075													1129-5767	1723-8633					2014	73	1					27	35		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.768	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.768													WOS:000338928300003

Effects of age-1 striped bass predation on juvenile fish in western Albemarle Sound	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY					Symposium on New Perspectives in Fish Energetics - A Return to Academic Nursery Grounds	2004	Madison, WI	Amer Fisheries Soc				Historically, the fisheries for adult river herring (i.e., alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and blueback herring A. aestivalis) and American shad A. sapidissima were economically important in Albemarle Sound, North Carolina. Stocks of these species axe in decline, while stocks of striped bass Morone saxatilis have increased roughly 10-fold in the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River since the early 1990s. The goal of this study was to quantify the predatory impact of age-1 striped bass on age-0 prey fishes by estimating striped bass consumption rates and comparing loss rates from predation with total prey loss rates using catch curves. Age-1 striped bass and their potential prey were collected with beach and purse seines from western Albemarle Sound from spring to fall, 2002 and 2003. Commercially and ecologically important prey in one or both years included river herring, American shad, Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus, and yellow perch Perca flavescens. Predation by age-1 striped bass had a marked effect on juvenile American shad densities in 2002 but little effect in 2003. Conversely, predation by age-1 striped bass explained none of the loss in juvenile yellow perch in 2002 but accounted for nearly all of the loss early in 2003. In most cases, predation by age-1 striped bass did not greatly influence juvenile alewife numbers. Juvenile blueback herring were preyed on during late summer and fall, but the predatory impact could not be confirmed because of apparent downstream emigration into the study area. Thus, for some species, these predator-prey linkages are important in determining year-class strength and should be incorporated into multispecies population models.

In the cool and rainy summer of 2000, the species almost disappeared from the lake again. P. lauterbornii was found in Karhijarvi for the first time in 1994 when it appeared in small numbers. The occurrence of P. laesterbornii in fresh waters in the Baltic Sea region is known only in a few cases whereas more records are from brackish waters. This paper describes the chemical and physical enviromnent of Karhijarvi and the species composition of phytoplankton in summer 1999 in comparison with long-term monitoring data of the lake. A general increase of air temperature and especially the mild winters during the 1990s probably favoured the northward invasion of the warm water species Planktonema lauterbornii.

J	Zhang, T; Li, JH; Pu, JB; Yuan, DX				Zhang, Tao; Li, Jianhong; Pu, Junbing; Yuan, Daoxian			Carbon dioxide exchanges and their controlling factors in Guijiang River, SW China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The important flux estimate of carbon exchange across the water-air interface in river systems of the global carbon cycle are being increasingly recognized. However, these estimates have large uncertainty due to the incomplete temporal and spatial coverage of CO2 flux. Here, we evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics and controlling factors of CO2 exchange across the water-air interface and their potential role in regional and global carbon budgets in 25 river transects along Guijiang River (GJR), southwestern China, in July and December 2016. These river transects were divided into upstream (US), middle (MS), and downstream (DS) reaches in non-karst, karst and mixed areas, respectively. The riverine CO2 fluxes showed obvious seasonal variations, ranging from 5.62 +/- 5.93 g/(m(2).d) in summer to 1.25 +/- 4.02 g/(m(2).d) in winter, with an average value of 3.44 +/- 5.48 g/(m(2).d). The riverine CO2 fluxes exhibited significant spatial patterns, where the highest and lowest averaged CO2 fluxes occurred at MS in summer and winter, respectively. Generally, the river was a carbon source with respect to the atmosphere throughout the year. However, the CO2 fluxes were obviously restrained by aquatic metabolism and the carbonate buffer system in winter. Additionally, the absorbed CO2 at MS was due to strong photosynthetic and carbonate buffer activities. Carbon loss via atmospheric exchange in the GJR river basin was 0.032 +/- 0.047 Tg C/yr, which accounted for 20.1% of the riverine dissolved carbon fluxes (0.160 +/- 0.075 Tg C/yr). Thus, 0.128Tg C yr(-1) was sequestered in the GJR basin. Our results demonstrate the need to emphasize the importance of aquatic photosynthesis and the carbonate buffer system in restraining CO2 degassing in karst rivers. It is important to underscore the detailed spatiotemporal changes in CO2 flux to reduce uncertainty in current estimates of global riverine CO2 emissions.					li, jianhong/D-3483-2009; Zhang, Tao/ACM-0777-2022; Pu, Junbing/A-8609-2015	Pu, Junbing/0000-0003-0418-4719													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2019	578								124073	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124073													WOS:000497250200047

Using two loci found to be polymorphic (out of seven tested), 19 electrophoretically determined clonal groups were identified. One clonal group was dominant throughout the research period (two years). Clonal diversity was characterised by seasonal fluctuations. Genotype frequencies were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in all but one of the 40 sampling dates. High values of clonal diversity were observed in samples collected under the winter ice cover. The production of males and ephippia was not related to the presence of specific clonal groups. Released ephippia were collected at different times in the summer and fall of the second year by sediment traps, and their hatching was observed in the laboratory under different conditions. After six months, only the eggs kept in the dark at 4 degrees C hatched. As expected, hatchlings showed high genetic diversity. Our data indicate that recruitment from resting eggs may be a likely source of genotypic variability and one of the main forces driving the seasonal variation in clonal diversity.

G.; Coe, Michael			Impacts of Variations in Caspian Sea Surface Area on Catchment-Scale and Large-Scale Climate	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The Caspian Sea (CS) is the largest inland lake in the world. Large variations in sea level and surface area occurred in the past and are projected for the future. The potential impacts on regional and large-scale hydroclimate are not well understood. Here, we examine the impact of CS area on climate within its catchment and across the northern hemisphere, for the first time with a fully coupled climate model. The Community Earth System Model (CESM1.2.2) is used to simulate the climate of four scenarios: (a) larger than present CS area, (b) current area, (c) smaller than present area, and (d) no-CS scenario. The results reveal large changes in the regional atmospheric water budget. Evaporation (e) over the sea increases with increasing area, while precipitation (P) increases over the south-west CS with increasing area. P-E over the CS catchment decreases as CS surface area increases, indicating a dominant negative lake-evaporation feedback. A larger CS reduces summer surface air temperatures and increases winter temperatures. The impacts extend eastwards, where summer precipitation is enhanced over central Asia and the north-western Pacific experiences warming with reduced winter sea ice. Our results also indicate weakening of the 500-hPa troughs over the northern Pacific with larger CS area. We find a thermal response triggers a southward shift of the upper troposphere jet stream during summer. Our findings establish that changing CS area results in climate impacts of such scope that CS area variations should be incorporated into climate model simulations, including palaeo and future scenarios.					; Koriche, Sifan/GLV-4615-2022; Koriche, Sifan A./GLV-4615-2022; Leroy, Suzanne/D-3996-2009	Coe, Michael/0000-0002-7470-0697; Cloke, Hannah/0000-0002-1472-868X; Koriche, Sifan A./0000-0003-1285-2035; Prange, Matthias/0000-0001-5874-756X; Leroy, Suzanne/0000-0002-2556-2339													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 27	2021	126	18							e2020JD034251	10.1029/2020JD034251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD034251													WOS:000702399300017
J	Song, LY; Li, L				Song, Liyan; Li, Lei			Variations in Bacterial Community in a Temperate Lake Associated with an Agricultural Watershed	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Terrestrially derived carbon and nutrients are washed into lakes, providing nutritional drivers for both microbial heterotrophy and phototrophy. Changes in the quantity and diversity of carbon and nutrients exported from watersheds in response to alterations in long-term land use have led to a need for evaluation of the linkage between watershed-exported carbon and nutrients and bacterial community structure in watershed associated lakes. To learn more about these interactions, we investigated Muskrat Lake in Michigan, which has a well-defined moderately sized watershed dominated by agriculture. We measured the water chemistry, characterized the dissolved organic carbon, and determined the structure of the bacterial communities at the inlet and center of this lake (five depths per site) over the summer and fall of 2008. The lake had temporal and rain event-based fluctuations in water chemistry, as well as temporal and rain event-dependent shifts in bacterial communities as measured by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Agricultural watershed inputs were observed in the lake during and after rain events. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and 454 pyrosequencing of the bacterial communities indicated that there were differences over time and that the dominant phylotypes shifted between summer and late fall. Some populations (e.g., Polynucleobacter and Mycobacterium) increased during fall, while others (e.g., Gemmatimonas) diminished. Redundancy and partitioning analyses showed that water chemistry is highly correlated with variations in the bacterial community of the lake, which explained 34 % of the variations in the bacterial community. Dissolved organic carbon had the greatest effects on variations in the Muskrat Lake bacterial community (2 %). The results of this study provide information that will enable a better understanding of the interaction between the bacterial community of lakes and changes in chemical properties as a result of nutrient importation from the surrounding watershed.

We studied lake waters and bottom sediments at 11 sampling stations throughout the basin and in different seasons between November 2007 and September 2008. It was established that, in this very productive and shallow lake, microbial activity increases in warmer seasons and ceases during winter. In spring, bacterial activity is fuelled by increased influx of highly reactive planktonic organic matter, which is decomposed via methanogenesis, reduction of NO3-, SO42-, and Fe and Mn oxides. On the other hand, during summer, oxidation processes (mainly oxidation of CH4) tend to predominate. The change from reduction to oxidation is attributed to wind-induced vertical mixing of Lake Sarbsko waters and resuspension of bottom deposits. Degradation of sedimentary organic matter in Lake Sarbsko results in appreciable changes in the pH and the concentrations.of red-ox sensitive ions in pore waters, but it has little effect on the chemistry of bottom and surface waters. However, release of PO43- from the sediments might he a source of this nutrient in the lake. Internal loading of phosphates in Lake Sarbsko occurs under both oxic/mildly reducing and anoxic conditions.					; Bechtel, Achim/A-9885-2011; Woszczyk, Michał/AAK-2933-2021; Cieslinski, Roman/A-5427-2008	Bechtel, Achim/0000-0002-3937-8209; Woszczyk, Michal/0000-0003-0695-4625; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	2					293	304		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.293	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2011.293													WOS:000294320400015

Los, H		Impact of climatic fluctuations on Characeae biomass in a shallow, restored lake in The Netherlands	ECO-HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING OF PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN COASTAL WATERS AND LAKES USING BLOOM	Deltares Select Series											External phosphorus load to a wetland with two shallow lakes in the Botshol Nature Reserve, The Netherlands, was reduced, resulting in a rapid reduction of phytoplankton biomass and turbidity, and after 4 years, explosive growth of Characeae. The clear water state was unstable, however, and the ecosystem then alternated between clear, high-vegetation and turbid, low-vegetation states. A model of water quality processes was used in conjunction with a 14-year nutrient budget for Botshol to determine if fluctuations in precipitation and nutrient load caused the ecosystem instability. The results indicate that, during wet winters when groundwater level rose above surface water level, phosphorus from runoff was stored in the lake bottom and banks. Stored phosphorus was released the following spring and summer under anaerobic sediment conditions, resulting in increased phytoplankton density and light attenuation in the water column. During years with high net precipitation, flow from land to surface water also transported humic acids, further increasing light attenuation. In years with dry winters, the phosphorus and humic acid loads to surface water were reduced, and growth of submerged macrophytes was enhanced by clear water. Thus, the temporal pattern of precipitation and flow from land to water gave a coherent, quantitative explanation of the observed dynamics in phosphorus, phytoplankton, turbidity, and Characeae. Global warming has caused winters in The Netherlands to become warmer and wetter during the last 50 years, increasing flow from land to water of humic acids and phosphorus and, ultimately, enhancing instability of Characeae populations. In the first half of the 20th century interannual variation in precipitation was not sufficient to cause large changes in internal P flux in Botshol, and submerged macrophyte populations were stable.																			1877-5608		978-1-58603-987-5				2009	1						123	132																WOS:000271712500007
J	Wang, XD; Zang, SY				Wang, Xiaodi; Zang, Shuying			Distribution characteristics and ecological risk assessment of toxic heavy metals and metalloid in surface water of lakes in Daqing Heilongjiang Province, China	ECOTOXICOLOGY												It is necessary to estimate heavy metal concentrations and risk in surface water for understanding the heavy metal contaminations and for sustainable protection of ecosystems and human health. To investigate the anthropogenic contribution of heavy metal accumulation surrounding an industrial city in China, the concentrations of six heavy metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and cadmium (Cd) were examined; from four different regions of Daqing in autumn 2011 and winter 2012. The results showed heavy metals distributed in the industrial area at concentrations relatively higher than those in other three areas, while concentrations in the farming area and the protected area were lower. The heavy metal concentrations of water bodies in all areas, except those for Hg and As, Cu, Pb and Cr were lower than the cutoff values for the Class I water quality that was set as the highest standard to protect the national nature reserves. While Hg and As of lakes in industry region had a higher level than those in the agriculture and landscape water, the lowest allowed. The concentrations of all the heavy metals in winter were higher than in the autumn. Cu had a higher ecological risks level to freshwater organisms. The discharge of urban sewage and industrial wastewater might be a major pollutant source, thus these sources should identified before remediation efforts. Efforts are needed to protect the lakes from pollution and also to reduce environmental health risks. This study and the valuable data will pave the way for future research on these Lakes in Daqing.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				MAY	2014	23	4			SI		609	617		10.1007/s10646-014-1177-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-014-1177-y								24420619					WOS:000335773400015

Seasonality of the Urban Heat Island Effect in Madison, Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Spatial and temporal variation in the urban heat island (UHI) effect from March 2012 through October 2013 was characterized using continuous temperature measurements from an array of up to 151 fixed sensors in and around Madison, Wisconsin, an urban area of population 407 000 surrounded by lakes and a rural landscape of agriculture, forests, wetlands, and grasslands. Spatially, the density of the built environment was the primary driver of temperature patterns, with local modifying effects of lake proximity and topographic relief. Temporally, wind speed, cloud cover, relative humidity, soil moisture, and snow all influenced UHI intensity, although the magnitude and significance of their effects varied by season and time of day. Seasonally, UHI intensities tended to be higher during the warmer summer months and lower during the colder months. Seasonal trends in monthly average wind speed and cloud cover tracked annual trends in UHI intensity, with clearer, calmer conditions that are conducive to the stronger UHIs being more common during the summer. However, clear, calm summer nights still had higher UHI intensities than clear, calm winter nights, indicating that some background factor, such as vegetation, shifted baseline UHI intensities throughout the year. The authors propose that regional vegetation and snow-cover conditions set seasonal baselines for UHI intensity and that factors like wind and clouds modified daily UHI intensity around that baseline.

J	Pérez, MT; Sommaruga, R				Teresa Perez, Maria; Sommaruga, Ruben			Temporal changes in the dominance of major planktonic bacterial groups in an alpine lake: discrepancy with their contribution to bacterial production	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We tested the idea that temporal changes in the numerical dominance of major bacterial groups are not necessarily coupled to those in bacterial production. The seasonal dynamics of the bacterial community in the water column of an alpine lake were followed from late spring until the autumn at either bi-weekly or monthly intervals. Changes in community structure were tracked by fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD-FISH); the contribution of the dominant bacterial groups to leucine incorporation was assessed by microautoradiography (MAR). Before ice-out, the bacterial assemblage was dominated by Actinobacteria. Immediately afterwards, their relative abundance, and that of Cytophaga-like bacteria, increased in the water column, suggesting that they had taken advantage of the input of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during the melting of the ice. During summer, Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria together accounted for > 50% of the cell counts; however, their maxima were separated temporally and vertically. Water temperature, DOM, and grazing influenced their antagonistic behavior. Alpha-proteobacteria were consistently present, although their abundance was generally low. Regardless of their relative abundance, Betaproteobacteria dominated the assemblage of leucine-positive cells, and the relative abundance of their R-BT subgroup closely matched that of active Betaproteobacteria. Of the cells positive for leucine incorporation, the contribution of Actinobacteria was lower than expected from their relative abundance. Our results show that bacterial abundance and production are not necessarily dominated by the same phylogenetic groups.

Under winter ice, 40 .mu.mol.cntdot.l-1 arsenate or arsenite inhibited microbial degradation of organic matter by 50%. Rates of oxidation of arsenite were about 2 .mu.mol.cntdot.l-1.cntdot.day-1 under aerobic conditions; rates of reduction of arsenate were about 1 .mu.mol.cntdot.l-1.cntdot.day-1 under anaerobic conditions. During the ice-free season, arsenate and arsenite had little apparent effect on rates of degradation of organic matter in lake tubes enriched with nutrients. Rates of formation of particulate P and rates of planktonic uptake of dissolved P were depressed in the presence of As. The observed rate of oxidation of arsenite in summer was similar to the winter value. Arsenate reduction rates (.simeq. 30 .mu.mol.cntdot.l-1.cntdot.day-1) were very rapid under short periods of anaerobiosis. In the presence of large nutrient (N, P) concentrations, As did not inhibit the development of high algal biomass. These experiments predict that addition of domestic sewage to arsenate-polluted Kam Lake (near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada) will result in restrained eutrophication. Degradation of organic matter will not be inhibited by As in summer; dissolved P concentrations will remain high due to As inhibition of P uptake by the plankton. During summer, growth of algal blooms may be moderated by As and more dissolved P will flow out of the lake to downstream waterbodies.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	3					415	423		10.1139/f80-055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-055													WOS:A1980JJ97200012

Spatial variations of the SCM magnitude, depth, and thickness during stratification and related factors were examined in a large, deep subtropical reservoir, Lake Qiandaohu. Significant spatial differences in the SCM parameters were found throughout the lake as thermal stratification developed in the late spring of 2014. SCM depth and thickness were positively correlated with euphotic depth and mixed layer depth but negatively correlated with epilimnetic nutrient concentrations. SCM magnitude was negatively correlated with euphotic depth and mixed layer depth and positively correlated with epilimnetic nutrient concentrations. Seasonal variations in SCM differed among subregions of the lake, which were related to seasonal differences in environmental parameters. SCM (averaging 66.2 mg/m(2) in spring and 96.4 mg/m(2) in summer) accounted for about 82% of the total areal chlorophyll of the water column (T-chl), and the SCM magnitude was better correlated with T-chl than the surface chlorophyll concentration. This study contributes to understanding of factors causing spatial variations in of SCM in the deep subtropical lakes. Plain Language Summary In deep lakes or reservoirs, maximum chlorophyll concentrations often occur as subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCM). In this study, a large and deep reservoir in China, Lake Qiandaohu, was selected to investigate the spatial and seasonal variations of the SCM. We used chlorophyll fluorescence profiles from 60 sites distributed across the lake in spring and summer in 2014 to determine SCM magnitude, depth, and thickness and to examine factors related to the variations. Higher water clarity, deeper mixing depth, and less epilimnetic nutrients led to lower SCM magnitude, thicker SCM thickness, and deeper SCM depth. Key Points Subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCM) had significant spatial differences in Lake Qiandaohu Light, mixing layer depth, and nutrients were related to the spatial pattern of SCM SCM magnitude correlated well with integrated chlorophyll through the water column					; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; , 张一波/AAY-5453-2020; Liu, Miao/AAH-9655-2021; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013	Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Liu, Miao/0000-0002-3888-1849; Zhou, Yongqiang/0000-0003-1402-345X; Zhang, Yibo/0000-0001-5542-2495													2169-8953	2169-8961				FEB	2020	125	2								10.1029/2019JG005480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JG005480													WOS:000534472900014
J	MILLER, FL; GUNN, A				MILLER, FL; GUNN, A			OBSERVATIONS OF BARREN-GROUND CARIBOU TRAVELING ON THIN ICE DURING AUTUMN MIGRATION	ARCTIC												In October 1982 we observed the consequences of migrating barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) encountering lake ice too thin to bear their weight. The observations were made on a portion of taiga winter range of the Beverly caribou herd during autumn migration in the Northwest Territories [Canada]. We observed caribou hesitating to cross ice that had no snow cover and also saw caribou breaking through ice. Bulls had greater difficulty extricating themselves from the icy water than did relatively light-bodied cows and young individuals. We necropsied one bull that we found dead after it had broken through the ice and remained in the water for more than 20 hours. The bull had died apparently from stress and hypothermia and had heavily traumatized areas on its forelegs and sternum from struggling to break the ice. We could not evalute the overall extent of injuries and mortalities to caribou from their encounters with thin ice, although we observed signs that at least hundreds had broken through the ice on different lakes.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				MAR	1986	39	1					85	88																WOS:A1986A968000016

This process occur-red in water collected below the photic zone (20 m) at the chemocline in the late autumn (November-January) and close to the sediment water interface in May when the chemocline starts to form. Averaged depth-integrated chemoautotrophic primary production at the chemocline was 16% and 24% of the photosynthetic primary production during May and autumn. respectively. The maximal rates were measured in December 1992, reaching values of > 90% of the photosynthetic rate. The delta C-13 of particulate organic matter at the chemocline ranged between -27 parts per thousand and -39 parts per thousand, the latter being associated with intensive chemosynthesis. These V delta C-13 values support our earlier hypothesis that chemoautotrophic bacteria constitute. directly or indirectly (through the microbial loop), a C-13-depleted food source for the zooplankton in the lake during autumn and early winter. Mass and isotopic balance of carbon and H2S suggest that chemosynthetic productivity may constitute 20%-25% of the primary production in Lake Kinneret annually.																			0024-3590					DEC	2001	46	8					1968	1976		10.4319/lo.2001.46.8.1968	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.8.1968													WOS:000172466500011
J	Bueh, C; Nakamura, H				Bueh, Cholaw; Nakamura, Hisashi			Scandinavian pattern and its climatic impact	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Maintenance mechanisms of the Scandinavian teleconnection pattern and its possible impact on the Eurasian climate are investigated on the basis of long-term monthly data. Its upstream portion over the North Atlantic is forced and maintained by feedback forcing from transient eddies migrating along the nearby storm track, with an additional contribution from incoming Rossby wave activity from further upstream. The primary anomaly centre over the Scandinavian Peninsula and the downstream portion of the pattern manifest themselves basically as Rossby waves propagating towards central Siberia and east Asia, under the modest feedback forcing from transient eddies. The pattern shows apparent seasonality in its dynamical properties, including the wave-train orientation and wavelength, under the seasonally varying transient-eddy feedback forcing and waveguide structure for Rossby waves. In cold seasons, the positive phase of the pattern causes cold-air accumulation over a vast area extending from western Siberia to the regions around Lake Baikal and Lake Balkhash, while giving rise to decreased precipitation over northeastern Europe, western Siberia and some of the Arctic coastal regions. The pattern also changes the North Atlantic sea surface temperature differently between autumn and winter.

Water samples were taken on 5 consecutive days in the spring, summer and fall of the year. Inputs of fecal indicator bacteria were determined through an analysis of variance. Fecal coliform and fecal streptococcus levels in lakewater varied in a seemingly erratic manner. When the bacterial densities at different points on the lake were examined by an analysis of variance, the locations with significantly higher densities of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci were most often found along the cottaged shoreline. Total coliform densities did not show this relationship with the cottaged shoreline. After rainfall, a large increase in numbers of fecal coliforms were found in the cottaged lakes but not in the uncottaged lake. Thus, the cottaged shoreline was a greater source of fecal indicator bacteria than the uncottaged shoreline. However, the highest concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria in these lakes were found in the inflowing streams. The bacteria in these streams arose from stormwater from undeveloped forested watersheds and were probably, therefore, of soil or animal, rather than human origin.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1982	16	7					1217	1222		10.1016/0043-1354(82)90140-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(82)90140-3													WOS:A1982NT13500019

Optimal population prediction of sandhill crane recruitment based on climate-mediated habitat limitations	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Prediction is fundamental to scientific enquiry and application; however, ecologists tend to favour explanatory modelling. We discuss a predictive modelling framework to evaluate ecological hypotheses and to explore novel/unobserved environmental scenarios to assist conservation and management decision-makers. We apply this framework to develop an optimal predictive model for juvenile (<1year old) sandhill crane Grus canadensis recruitment of the Rocky Mountain Population (RMP). We consider spatial climate predictors motivated by hypotheses of how drought across multiple time-scales and spring/summer weather affects recruitment. Our predictive modelling framework focuses on developing a single model that includes all relevant predictor variables, regardless of collinearity. This model is then optimized for prediction by controlling model complexity using a data-driven approach that marginalizes or removes irrelevant predictors from the model. Specifically, we highlight two approaches of statistical regularization, Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and ridge regression. Our optimal predictive Bayesian LASSO and ridge regression models were similar and on average 37% superior in predictive accuracy to an explanatory modelling approach. Our predictive models confirmed a priori hypotheses that drought and cold summers negatively affect juvenile recruitment in the RMP. The effects of long-term drought can be alleviated by short-term wet spring-summer months; however, the alleviation of long-term drought has a much greater positive effect on juvenile recruitment. The number of freezing days and snowpack during the summer months can also negatively affect recruitment, while spring snowpack has a positive effect. Breeding habitat, mediated through climate, is a limiting factor on population growth of sandhill cranes in the RMP, which could become more limiting with a changing climate (i.e. increased drought). These effects are likely not unique to cranes. The alteration of hydrological patterns and water levels by drought may impact many migratory, wetland nesting birds in the Rocky Mountains and beyond. Generalizable predictive models (trained by out-of-sample fit and based on ecological hypotheses) are needed by conservation and management decision-makers. Statistical regularization improves predictions and provides a general framework for fitting models with a large number of predictors, even those with collinearity, to simultaneously identify an optimal predictive model while conducting rigorous Bayesian model selection. Our framework is important for understanding population dynamics under a changing climate and has direct applications for making harvest and habitat management decisions.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				SEP	2015	84	5					1299	1310		10.1111/1365-2656.12370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12370								25808951					WOS:000360093400016

Foraminiferal and facies analyses of a 460-kyr record from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 346 Site U1427 in the Japan Sea reveal a record of nutrient flux and oxygenation that varied due to sea level and East Asian monsoon intensity. The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) was most intense during marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e, MIS 7e, MIS 9e, and MIS 11c when the Tsushima Warm Current flowed into an unrestricted well-mixed normal salinity Japan Sea, whereas East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) conditions dominated MIS 2, MIS 4, MIS 6, and MIS 8 when sea level minima restricted the Japan Sea resulting in low-salinity and oxygen conditions in the absence of Tsushima flow. Reduced oxygen stratified, low-salinity, and higher productivity oceanic conditions characterize Terminations TV, TIII, TII, and TI when East China Sea coastal waters breached the Tsushima Strait. Chinese loess, cave, and Lake Biwa (Japan) and U1427 proxy records suggest EASM intensification during low to high insolation transitions, whereas the strongest EAWM prevailed during lowest insolation periods or high to low insolation transitions. Ice sheet/CO2 forcing leads to the strongest EAWM events in glacials and enhanced EASM in interglacials. Mismatches between proxy patterns suggest that latitudinal and land/sea thermal contrasts played a role in East Asian monsoon variability, suggesting that a complex interplay between ice sheet dynamics, insolation, and thermal gradients controls monsoonal intensity.					; De Vleeschouwer, David/ABA-6115-2020; Alvarez Zarikian, Carlos/IUM-5257-2023; Bassetti, Maria-Angela/AAD-5998-2022; Black, Heather/NQF-9310-2025; Gallagher, Stephen/AFL-9448-2022; Henderson, Andrew/A-1434-2009; Henderson, Andrew C.

We experimentally assessed the effects of osmotic (0, 10, 20, 25 and 30 psu) and thermal (20 degrees C) shock on mortality, activity and physiology of P. antipodarum collected at Capitol Lake, Olympia, Washington, USA, during winter and spring seasons when environmental temperature was 5 and 10 degrees C respectively. We measured standard metabolic rate and enzymatic activities (malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanopine dehydrogenase) in snails after a 10-day acclimation period at high salinity. Significantly higher mortalities were observed at higher salinities; the strongest effects occurred on snails collected at the end of winter, and exposed to 30 psu and 20 degrees C (100% mortality in 3 days). When snails were collected during the spring, 100% mortality was observed after 40 days at 30 psu and 20 degrees C. Standard metabolic rates were significantly lower when snails were exposed to salinities of 25 and 30 psu, even after 10 days of acclimation. Enzymatic activities showed small but significant declines after 10 days at 30 psu reflecting the declines observed in overall metabolism. The physiological tolerances to temperature and salinity displayed by this population of P. antipodarum make its eradication from Capital Lake difficult to achieve.					; Paolucci, Esteban/V-6211-2018	Thuesen, Erik V./0000-0002-1438-6552; Paolucci, Esteban/0000-0001-7847-1484													1619-0033	1314-2488				JAN 9	2020		54					1	22		10.3897/neobiota.54.39465	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.54.39465													WOS:000508651000001

Tintinnids (Ciliophora: Choreotrichia) of the Suez Canal and their transmigration process between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												On its route from the Mediterranean in the north to the Red Sea in the south, the Suez Canal crosses three different lakes which represent different habitats, and in some cases, hinder the migration of the fauna and flora from one sea to the other. Tintinnid species-specific abundance was determined at monthly intervals from 10 stations in the Suez Canal. A total of 18 species were recorded in the canal water, all Indo-Pacific in origin. Six of these species have been introduced to the Mediterranean, while 11 are new geographical records for the Suez Canal. Most species exhibited a seasonal cycle with low winter and high spring and summer densities. Tintinnid affinities and differences between the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea were discussed in the light of the results of distribution studies of the eighteen species of Tintinnid carried out over a complete year. These observations point to the role of the canal as a selective barrier and/or as a link in the migration of Tintinnid protozoa. While cases of migration from one sea to the other are more likely to occur in either direction, those concerning species of Indo-Pacific origin are more successful and numerous. Meanwhile, the Suez Canal acts as a local endemic habitat by itself.					; El-Serehy, Hamed/GVT-7938-2022; AL-Rasheid, Khaled/C-2486-2008	EL-SEREHY, HAMED/0000-0002-7686-0010; 													1463-4988	1539-4077					2014	17	4					454	462		10.1080/14634988.2014.979601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2014.979601													WOS:000346423200016

This study examined the distribution characteristics of sulfonamide antibiotics and resistance genes in the urban section of the Yitong River in autumn and winter. In addition, the correlation between them and water quality parameters was analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. The surface water from the Yitong River was sampled in September and November for this experiment. The results of 32 samples showed that seven sulfonamides were detected in the surface water and sediments of this reach, and the concentrations were generally at the levels of ng/L and ng/g. The total concentration range was 11-161 ng/L and ND-85.7 ng/g. The concentrations of different antibiotics were similar in autumn and winter, and the concentration of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was higher than that of other antibiotics. The results of the Risk Quotients (RQs) showed that SMX and sulfadiazine (SDZ) had moderate acute risk to the corresponding sensitive species in river water, sulfapyridine (SPD) and sulfisoxazole (SIZ) had low acute risk, while the rest had no risk. The total bacterial abundance in surface water and sediment was in the range of 10(4)-10(5) copies/mL and 10(8)-10(11) copies/g, respectively. The detection rates of three sulfonamide resistance genes were 100%; the relative abundance was in the range of 10(-3)-10(-1) copies/16S rRNA, and sul1 was the primary resistance gene. The results of correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between sulfamethazine (SMZ), sulfathiazole (STZ), and SIZ and water quality indexes such as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). The river's change of water quality environment could significantly affect the antibiotics' spatial distribution characteristics and content. The higher the level of nutrients, the higher the concentration of antibiotics. The abundance of sulfa resistance genes was positively correlated with the concentration of sulfa antibiotics. Frequent human activities can increase antibiotic concentration, leading to the production of more resistance genes induced by antibiotics, but the main reason for the formation of resistance genes was not apparent. Therefore, exploring the occurrence and pollution characteristics of antibiotics and ARGs in the environment of the Yitong River Basin in Changchun City and analyzing their sources, transmission, and ecological risks in the environment provided an essential scientific basis for pollution prevention and ecological protection of urban rivers in northern China.

IHERINGIA SERIE BOTANICA												Phytoplankton community in maturation lakes, Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the phytoplanktic's community of the Maturation Lakes from Station Sewerage Treatment of Caxias do Sul University, over a year. It has been considered the community's features (richness, composition, density, diversity and equitability). The samples were taken monthly from August 2005 to July 2006. Were identified 242 taxa in generic, specific and infra-specific levels. The phytoplanktic community was similar all over the 12 months sampled, however the Chlorophyceae and Zygnematophyceae were more significant in the hot months. In the low temperature months it could be perceived the Cyanophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and the Euglenophyceae more significantly. The species with highest annual density were: Chlorella miniata (Nageli) Oltmanns, Synechocystis aquatilis Souvageau, Surirella ovata Kutzing, Lepocinclis fusiformis (Carter) Lemmermann e Cosmarium sp. It happened a seasonal variation in the standing-stock with a maximum in the fall (4,2 x 10(5) ind./mL) and summer (2,9 x 10(5) ind./mL) and a minimum in the spring (1 x 10(5) ind./mL). The diversity and equitability indices, as well as the richness values showed a little significative difference among the seasons of the year themselves and the seasons sampled, however, they showed a more significative difference among the sampled months.																				2446-8231				JUN 30	2010	65	1					75	85																WOS:000281782900007

The Seabin (an easily operated and cost-effective floating debris collection device) can help clean up buoyant plastic debris in calm waters while monitoring water pollution. A Seabin was used to conduct a comparative analysis of plastic and microplastic concentrations in northern Lake Garda (Italy) during peak and low tourist seasons. The composition of the litter was further investigated using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The analysis showed a decreased mean amount of plastic from summer (32.5 mg/m3) to autumn (17.6 mg/m3), with an average number of collected microplastics per day of 45 +/- 15 and 15 +/- 3, respectively. Packaging and foam accounted for 92.2% of the recognized plastic waste products. The material composition of the plastic mass (442 pieces, 103.0 g) was mainly identified as polypropylene (PP, 47.1%) and polyethylene (PE, 21.8%). Moreover, 313 microplastics (approximately 2.0 g) were counted with average weight in the range of 1-16 mg. A case study of selected plastic debris was also conducted. Spectroscopic, microscopic, and thermal analysis of specimens provided insights into how aging affects plastics in this specific environment. The purpose of this study was to establish a baseline for further research on the topic, to provide guidelines for similar analyses from a multidisciplinary perspective, to monitor plastic pollution in Lake Garda, and to inform policy makers, scientists, and the public.																				2673-8929				JUL 28	2025	4	3							44	10.3390/microplastics4030044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microplastics4030044													WOS:001580332800001

Proxy records used here were ice break-up in the Aurajoki River, the Baltic Sea ice extent, the plant phenological index and the annual varve thickness in the Pyhajarvi Lake. Records were integrated into one palaeoclimate model using time-scale dependent calibration techniques. Reconstruction was verified with statistics showing a high degree of validation between the reconstructed and observed temperatures in Turku, south-west Finland. Reconstruction demonstrates that the springs have become warmer and reveals a warming trend since 1850s. Except for the period from 1750 to around 1850, the springs have been characterized as having a larger low-frequency variability, as well as by having a smaller range of annual temperature variations. Analyses of decadal variations revealed that the coldest springtimes occurred in the 1840s and 1850s and the first decade of the 19th century. Reconstruction was compared with the available meteorological series of central England, Stockholm, St. Petersburg, Uppsala and the spring-temperature reconstruction from western Norway. The effect of global solar, volcanic, greenhouse gases and aerosol forcings were examined together with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices at local scale over the reconstructed period. Reconstructed spring-temperature changes have been related to changes in the atmospheric circulation, as indicated by the NAO (February-June).																			0165-0009	1573-1480				JAN	2009	92	1-2					213	233		10.1007/s10584-008-9477-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-008-9477-y													WOS:000262392900013
J	NYMAN, C				NYMAN, C			MACROZOOBENTHOS IN SOME RAPIDS IN A LOWLAND RIVER IN FINLAND BEFORE AND AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION OF A HYDROELECTRIC POWER-PLANT	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT					6th International Symposium on Regulated Streams (SISORS II)	AUG 03-06, 1994	UNIV S BOHEMIA, FAC BIOL SCI, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC		UNIV S BOHEMIA, FAC BIOL SCI			In the beginning of the 1980s a hydroelectric power plant was constructed in the middle course of the lowland river Perhonjoki in western Finland. Some shallow lakes upstream of the power plant were enlarged for use as a reservoir and some rapids downstream were dredged and remodelled. As a consequence of the construction, the flow was almost completely diverted from a 2.5km stretch of the river and the former rapids in this area were remodelled with weirs. The discharge from the power plant was regulated in the short term during low flow seasons in winter and summer. The effects of this project on the stream bottom fauna has been studied. The sampling started in 1980 before any major impact took place and has continued until 1992. In the low flow stretch of the river the lotic fauna of the former rapids has withdrawn to small rivulets and several species have disappeared, including the large caddisfly Arctopsyche ladogensis. In the remodelled rapids downstream from the power plant large numbers of black fly larvae have appeared every spring since the power plant was completed. The reason for this was probably dredging of the rapids, which wiped out the natural moss vegetation on the stones in the rapids and generated large areas of bare stone surfaces in places with suitable current velocities for the larvae. A lake outlet effect might also be part of the reason, even if samples of the phytoplankton could not demonstrate higher amounts of plankton downstream of the power plant reservoir than upstream. In late summer the number of filter-feeding trichopterans has increased and the species composition has changed. Neurclipsis bimaculata and Ceratopsyche nevae have become more abundant and Arctopsyche ladogensis as well as several species commonly found among water moss have disappeared.																			0886-9375					AUG	1995	10	2-4					199	205		10.1002/rrr.3450100214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rrr.3450100214													WOS:A1995RQ94100013

Modeling spring-summer phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan with and without riverine nutrient loading	OCEAN DYNAMICS												There were two phytoplankton blooms captured by remote sensing in Lake Michigan in 1998, one from March to May, and one during June. In this paper, those phytoplankton blooms were simulated by a coupled physical-biological model, driven by observed meteorological forcing in 1998. The model reasonably reproduced the lake currents. The biological model results, with and without riverine nutrient loading, were compared with the remote sensing data. A 3-month-long donut-like phytoplankton bloom that appeared in southern Lake Michigan was reasonably well simulated only when riverine input was included, indicating the importance of riverine nutrient input for supporting the growth of phytoplankton in Lake Michigan. The model with riverine input also captured a second event-driven phytoplankton bloom during June with weaker magnitude that occurred in mid-south Lake Michigan, which lasted for about 20 days. The major reason for the weaker bloom in June was that vertical mixing in the hydrodynamic model was too weak (leading to a mixed-layer depth of 20 m) to bring the bottom nutrient-rich water up to the epilimnion. High chlorophyll concentration that persisted in Green Bay for almost a year was simulated with less intensity.

J	Hellweger, FL; Lall, U				Hellweger, FL; Lall, U			Modeling the effect of algal dynamics on arsenic speciation in Lake Biwa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Algae reduce and methylate arsenate and the end product of the reaction is correlated to their growth rate. At slow growth rates, dimethylarsinate (DMA) is produced, and at fast growth rates arsenite (As(Ill)) is produced. Previous work has linked this phenomenon to the phosphorus luxury uptake mechanism of algae, and a model was developed for the process (Hellweger et al. Limnol. Oceanogr. 2003, 48, 2275). This paper presents the integration of that process model for arsenic transformation by algae into a full ecological model and application to Lake Biwa, Japan. The model application allows for a quantitative analysis of the field data, consistent with the process model and the ecological dynamics of the lake. The newly developed ecological model includes a variable phytoplankton composition, which is needed to simulate luxury uptake. This is in contrast to most existing ecological models, which typically assume a fixed "Redfield" composition. The model adequately reproduces the observed ecology of Lake Biwa, including the rapid uptake of phosphate by phytoplankton without immediate growth (luxury uptake) following lake overturn. The model also reproduces the observed arsenic speciation, including the gradual appearance of DMA during the summer and peaks in As(Ill) concentration at the onset of spring and fall algal blooms.

To determine the status of Blastocystis infection in wild rodents in China. Methods: A total of 344 faecal samples were collected from seven wild rodent species from three provinces, and the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes of Blastocystis were amplified to determine their prevalence and subtypes. Results: Of the 344 samples, 54 (15.70%) were detected as Blastocystis-positive. The prevalence of Blastocystis was 26.14% (40/153), 7.95% (7/88), and 6.80% (7/103) in wild rodents from Hunan Province, Yunnan Province, and Guangxi Province, respectively. The prevalence of Blastocystis in different wild rodent species varied from 0.00% (0/13) in Mus musculus to 40.00% (2/5) in Rattus rattus sladeni. The prevalence of Blastocystis in samples from the lake beach area (27.40%, 40/146) was significantly higher than in those from the mountain (6.80%, 7/103) and field regions (7.37%, 7/95). The prevalence in different seasons was 26.14% in summer (40/153), 7.95% in autumn (7/88), and 6.80% in winter (7/103). Moreover, a total of two Blastocystis subtypes were identified in the investigated wild rodents, including ST4 and ST5. Discussion: The present study discovered the existence of Blastocystis infection in Rattus favipectus, Microtus fortis, Apodemus agrarius, Bandicota indica, Rattus rattus sladeni, and Rattus losea, expanding the host range of this parasite. The findings also demonstrate that wild rodents may be an important potential infection source for Blastocystis infection in humans and other animals.

Mysids were collected at a station 20 km offshore of Grand Haven, Michigan, in spring, summer and autumn and then size-sorted. In Oct. 1980 and May 1981, plankton samples were collected in 2 size categories: > 78 .mu.m and > 156 .mu.m. Mysid fecal pellets and Pontoporeia hoyi were collected in May 1981, while a 4-horn sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) was collected in Oct. 1980. Concentrated extracts of all samples were analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbons by electron-capture gas chromatography. Toxic organics detected were, in order of concentration: PCB [polychlorinated biphenyl], DDE, dieldrin, .gamma.-chlordane and HCB [hexachlorobenzene]. DDT, DDD and .alpha.-chlordane were detected less frequently. PCB concentrations in mysids were similar to those observed in their plankton diet and there was no evidence of increased bioaccumulation with increased mysid age. Dieldrin and DDE generally occurred in higher concentrations in older than in younger mysids. Dieldrin concentrations were lower in the plankton than in mysids. Certain toxicants (PCB, DDD, dieldrin and .gamma.-chlordane) occurred in higher concentrations in P. hoyi than in mysids. Concentrations in the sculpin generally were intermediate to those in amphipods and mysids. Mysids had a significant role in the recycling of toxic organics and the characteristic pathways varied with the contaminant.

Two years of further study confirmed that winter swan populations are directly correlated with macrophytes, for samples taken on a single day in winter each year. They also confirmed that winter maximum swan populations can be predicted from measurements of phytoplankton productivity in the previous summer. This relationship is inverse. For 6 other lakes, 9 of the 11 data points lay within the 95% confidence intervals of the macrophyte-swan relationship, with the only outlier being a lake in which the macrophytic vegetation is dominated by filamentous algae. Further analysis, giving equal weight to each of the 7 lakes in the sample, confirmed that there is a significant correlation in winter between swan populations and macrophyte biomass for these lakes which show a wide range of size and trophic status. There was no such significant correlation in summer. All of the 8 data points from 7 other lakes lay within the rather broad 95% confidence intervals of the phytoplankton- swan relationship. The 4 lakes which fitted most closely to the predictions of this relationship have silty sediment. The other 3, which all had lower swan populations than predicted, have sediment predominantly of sand or fine clay, and macrophyte biomass and swan populations may be constrained by the nature of the sediment, rather than by shading effects from phytoplankton.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 1	1994	279						163	170		10.1007/BF00027851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027851													WOS:A1994NK39900017

However, phytoplankton community is poorly understood in large river ecosystems. Based on the large-scale samplings conducted in spring and autumn of 2017, a systematic study has been made on seasonal and spatial distributions of phytoplankton community along the mainstream of the Yangtze River. As results, 6 phyla were identified and 59 phytoplankton species were detected using microscopy, including Bacillariophyta (29 species), Chlorophyta (13 species) and Cyanophyta (8 species) as the dominant group. Moreover, the density of phytoplankton was ranged 0.05 x 10(6)-1.90 x 10(6) cells/L and the biomass was 0.01-1.01 mg/L, both reaching their maximum in the middle reach from Yichang to Wuhan. Significant seasonal difference of phytoplankton community was observed and spatial dissimilarity in spring was revealed. The cell abundance and biomass of phytoplankton could be fairly estimated by chlorophyll-a, and redundancy analysis indicated that water temperature, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrite, and ammonia nitrogen were the most important explanatory environmental factors for phytoplankton compositions in the Yangtze River.					; liu, yuxin/GRY-3592-2022	Wang, Ting/0000-0003-1169-0089; Ni, Jinren/0000-0002-9114-8347													1674-7321	1869-1900				NOV	2019	62	11			SI		1873	1884		10.1007/s11431-019-9545-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11431-019-9545-y													WOS:000496033900001

The Hg transport from the high arctic Zackenberg River Basin was assessed in 2009 in order to describe and estimate the mercury transported from land to the marine environment. A total of 95 water samples were acquired and filtered (0.4 mu m pore size), and Hg concentrations were determined in both the filtered water and in the sediment. A range of other elements were also measured in the water samples. Hg concentrations in the filtered water were in general highest in the beginning of the season when the water came mainly from melted snow. THg concentrations in the sediment were in general relatively constant or slightly decreasing until mid-August, where after the concentrations increased. A principal component analysis separated the samples into spring, summer and autumn samples indicating seasonal characteristics of the patterns of element concentrations. The total amount of Hg in the sediment transported was estimated to 2.6 kg. Approximately 60% of the sediment-transported Hg occurred during a 24-h flood in the beginning of August caused by a glacial lake outburst flood. The total amount of transported dissolved Hg was estimated to 46 g, and 13% of this transport occurred during the 24-h flood. If it is assumed that the Hg transport by Zackenberg River is representative for the general glacial rivers in East Greenland, the total Hg transport into the North Atlantic from Greenland alone is approximately 4.6 tons year(-1) with an estimated annual freshwater discharge of similar to 440 km(3).

Geochemical methods for inferring seasonal occupation of an estuarine shellmound: a case study from San Francisco Bay	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Seasonal patterns of Native American residence and use of shell mounds of the San Francisco Bay area, California are of great interest. This work investigates seasonal occupation by means of a new method for interpretation of geochemical data from Mytilus trossulus specimens recovered from one of these structures, the Ellis Landing Shell Mound (CA-CCO-295). The approach, which is suitable for relatively small shell fragments from a variety of archaeological contexts, is used to infer the environmental conditions (temperature and salinity of ambient water) at harvest time, compared with average conditions for the period, and thus estimate the season during which the shells were harvested. This information, in turn, is employed to evaluate current models about the growth and construction of prehistoric shell mounds in San Francisco Bay. The method was applied to seven different lenses in the shell mound ranging in age from similar to 240 cal yr BP to similar to 3510 cal yr BP. We found that, although seasonal occupation varied over time, it generally was confined to summer through late fall, with little indication of winter gathering. Our findings suggest that California shell mounds, such as Ellis Landing, were constructed in a very different manner than some other mounded places used by contemporaneous hunter-gatherers elsewhere in North America.

MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Constructed waters (e.g. dams and retired quarries) are commonly found to have a different zooplankton composition than are natural waters, and to be more readily invaded by non-indigenous species. Constructed ponds are common on farmland, but zooplankton research in these areas is scarce. Consequently, our aims were to (1) compare zooplankton communities between natural ponds and dams in rural environments and, (2) examine environmental determinants of zooplankton community composition among rural ponds. Thirty-eight ponds on farmland in New Zealand were sampled for zooplankton in winter-spring 2018 and summer 2019. All ponds were eutrophic, and zooplankton taxa typical of such conditions were common in both pond types (e.g.Brachionus,KeratellaandPolyarthraspecies). Zooplankton community composition differed statistically between each type, although we deemed this difference to be ecologically insignificant (one-way ANOSIM,r = 0.09,P = 0.014). Prevalence of non-indigenous species was low, with 7% of farm dams and 2% of natural ponds being invaded, indicating that farm ponds are not acting as 'stepping-stones' for invaders across landscapes. Macrophyte abundance and concentration of humic substances were the dominant environmental variables measured determining zooplankton distribution among ponds.					; Duggan, Ian/G-2275-2012; Özkundakci, Deniz/B-2796-2009	Le Quesne, Kelly/0000-0002-7363-3226; Duggan, Ian/0000-0002-6037-9759; Ozkundakci, Deniz/0000-0002-5442-4576; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2021	72	3					330	340		10.1071/MF20030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF20030		JUL 2020											WOS:000550844100001

Annual bacterial community cycle in a seasonally ice-covered river reflects environmental and climatic conditions	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Bacteria are key players in biogeochemical cycles and control water quality in freshwater ecosystems. Nevertheless, little is known about the identity and ecology of riverine bacteria, especially during ice-covered periods that are often mistakenly perceived as periods with negligible biological activities. Here, we analyzed in detail the effects of environmental and climatic conditions on freshwater bacterial community structure and diversity over a 2-yr sampling campaign, targeting a seasonally ice-covered river of the Quebec City (Canada) area, the Saint-Charles River. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 16S ribosomal RNA gene high-throughput sequencing demonstrated a strong seasonal cycle of the bacterial community composition with rapid successions of bacterial lineages, reflecting the harsh climatic condition of the region. During the summer, the bacterial community was dominated by typical freshwater microorganisms such as Limnohabitans, Sporichthyaceae hgcI/acI clade, and Pseudarcicella. In contrast, the results suggest that during the cold season, the low water temperatures, combined with other prevailing conditions such as reduced light availability and minimal particulate inputs from the catchment, created various environmental niches for potential methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria, such as Crenothrix and Methylobacter, other Betaproteobacteria, such as Candidatus Methylopumilus, Candidatus Nitrotoga, and Rhodoferax, as well as Verrucomicrobia and Parcubacteria. The presence of these taxa in the winter suggests active carbon, iron, and nitrogen cycling under ice, whereas summer lineages are dormant or in a phase of reduced activity. These results increase our understanding of bacterial dynamic and potential metabolic processes occurring in seasonally ice-covered inland waters, providing evidence that winter can be an especially important period for freshwater ecological processes.					; Cruaud, Perrine/U-9631-2019; Rodriguez, Manuel/P-3713-2015; Charette, Steve/GYJ-3058-2022	Rodriguez, Manuel J/0000-0003-2010-6438; Vigneron, Adrien/0000-0003-3552-8369; Cruaud, Perrine/0000-0001-8628-3600													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2020	65			1	SI		S21	S37		10.1002/lno.11130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11130													WOS:000508766900003

It is a traditional habitat for the endangered Yangtze finless porpoise, which has not been well investigated. To reveal the distribution of the porpoise in Poyang Lake, 12 passive acoustic surveys were conducted along 123 km of the main channel of the lake during different seasons (spring transition season, wet season, autumn transition season, and dry season) from 2008 to 2012. We counted the number of phonating porpoises encountered and calculated the detection rate (encountered individuals detected per kilometer). The median porpoise detection rates ranged from 0 to 0.65 individuals per kilometer during the different surveys. The highest median detection rate of 0.50 was detected in the autumn transition season. The seasonal shrinking of the lake during the dry season may cause a concentration of porpoises in the narrow channels and a high incidence of collisions with cargo ships and fishing boats. Conservation actions should be focused on the main channel of the lake during the dry and transition seasons. In addition, the expansion of the existing reserve to include areas with high porpoise detection rates is necessary.					; Akamatsu, Tomonari/I-6375-2016; Mei, Zhigang/AAQ-1545-2020; li, song hai/A-2652-2012; Li, Songhai/A-2652-2012	AKAMATSU, Tomonari/0000-0003-2661-6199; dong, li jun/0000-0003-4303-5513; li, song hai/0000-0003-4977-1722; Mei, Zhigang/0000-0002-1826-9177													0824-0469	1748-7692				APR	2015	31	2					612	628		10.1111/mms.12181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mms.12181													WOS:000353382900012

THE WILD FOREST REINDEER, RANGIFER TARANDUS FENNICUS, IN THE METSOLA BIOSPHERE RESERVE, NORTHWEST RUSSIA	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The existence of the wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus) in North Europe is under threat. Urgent measures are needed to protect this species. One of the main measures under consideration is the development of a network of Protected Areas (PAs). The Russian part of the Finnish-Russian Friendship Nature Reserve includes a part of the Metsola Biosphere Reserve (MBR). The MBR contains habitats of the Kuhmo Area - Lake Kiitehenjarvi's (Lake Kamennoe) R.t. fennicus subpopulation and it is of great importance for this animal. This area mainly includes summer pastures and rutting and calving areas, while some of these animals also use this area as winter pastures. Tracking animal locations and moving activity with telemetry showed the continuation of seasonal migrations of this animal across the Russian-Finnish border. This confirms the mix of animals living in Finland in the region of Kainuu and animals living in the Republic of Karelia (Russia), as well as the importance of the MBR for maintaining the genetic diversity of R.t. fennicus in both countries. Some of the animals may change their migration patterns and seasonal home ranges, staying in Russia for wintering. There was one case of a collared R.t. fennicus female moving far to the east from the Kuhmo Area - Lake Kiitehenjarvi subpopulation's habitat to the surroundings of the village of Chernyi Porog (Segezhsky district). The genetic purity of R.t. fennicus is influenced by the reindeer husbandry practice in Finland. There are cases of semi-domesticated reindeer (i.e. originating from another Rangifer tarandus subspecies, R. t. tarandus) occurrence in the MBR, where they were observed in mating (harem) groups of R. t. fennicus. Evaluation and analysis of the age and sex structure of the subpopulation in the summer-autumn period in Russia in 2018-2020 showed a small percentage of calves, approximately 12% of all encountered animals. This may indicate a high predator pressure (e.g. from the side of Canis lupus, Gulo gulo, and Ursus arctos). Over the last three years, out of 16 collared R.t. fennicus females appeared in Karelia, four of them were killed by predators. The location of the habitats near the state border west of the fence, protected with barbed wire (engineered structures) together with control in the PAs (including MBR) ensure the animal protection from poachers. There was only one case of animal death caused by illegal hunting over the last five years. Forest logging may have a significant impact on the future of R.t. fennicus in the MBR. Under conditions of increasing human impact on the surrounding areas, the MBR importance in the R.t. fennicus population conservation also increased. However, to enhance the positive effect, it will be necessary to expand the network of PAs. One of the nearest promising potential PAs is the planned Kalevala Sanctuary.					; Panchenko, Danila/A-9616-2014	Panchenko, Danila/0000-0003-1955-4196; Hyvarinen, Marja/0000-0002-7581-9251; 													2500-008X						2021	6			1			116	126		10.24189/ncr.2021.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.24189/ncr.2021.026													WOS:000661136500010

Weather and eared grebe winter migration near the Great Salt Lake, Utah	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												This study provides insight from the use of weather radar observations to understand the characteristics of the eared grebe migration near the Great Salt Lake (GSL) and provides unique information on weather conditions connected to these migration events. Doppler weather radar measurements from the Salt Lake City, Utah WSR-88D radar site (KMTX), along with meteorological surface and rawinsonde data, were used to identify and examine 281 eared grebe migration events across 15 winters from 1997/1998 through 2011/2012. An average of about 19 migration events occurred each winter with considerable interannual variability, as well as large variance in the spatial area and number of birds departing the GSL during each event. The migration events typically occurred during clear sky conditions in the presence of surface high pressure and colder than average surface temperatures. Migration events began 55 min after sunset, on average across the winter seasons, and in one case we demonstrate that an extended, nonstop flight was initiated of the departing eared grebes to northern Mexico. Eared grebes leaving the GSL largely flew above the freezing level with a mean northerly tailwind at flight altitude of 3.1 m s(-1) and a westerly, cross-flight wind of 5.0 m s(-1) while having an average flight speed at cruising altitude of 16.9 m s(-1), or 61 km h(-1). In addition to determining the variability of meteorological conditions during migration events across the 15 winters, atmospheric conditions during the largest migration event observed are presented and discussed.

This situation stabilizes the water column preventing the mixing in the vertical. In winter the mixing processes are active and homogenize water column, total (holomictic lakes) or partially (meromictic lakes). In a small pit lake of the Iberian Pyrite Belt, which showed a singular stratification, the mixing in the vertical has been detected in the summer. The destabilization of pre-existing thermal stratification is caused by the increase of dissolved solids concentration in a thin shallow layer due to the evaporation effects. Temperature record in water column and the specific measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration, redox species of iron and total dissolved solid have made possible to identify this exceptional phenomenon.

Dreissenid mussels from the Great Lakes contain elevated thiaminase activity	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We examined thiaminase activity in dreissenid Mussels collected at different depths and seasons, and from various locations in Lakes Michigan, Ontario, and Huron. Here we present evidence that two dreissenid mussel species (Dreissena bugensis and D. polymorpha) contain thiaminase activity that is 5-100 fold greater than observed in Great Lakes fishes. Thiaminase activity in zebra Mussels ranged from 10,600 to 47,900 pmol g(-1).min(-1) and activities in quagga mussels ranged from 19,500 to 223,800 pmol g(-1).min(-1). Activity in the mussels was greatest in spring, less in summer, and least in fall. Additionally, we observed greater thiaminase activity in dreissenid mussels collected at shallow depths compared to mussels collected at deeper depths. Dreissenids constitute a significant and previously unknown pool of thiaminase in the Great Lakes food web compared to other known Sources of this thiamine (vitamin B(1))-degrading enzyme. Thiaminase in forage fish of the Great Lakes has been causally linked to thiamine deficiency in salmonines. We Currently do not know whether linkages exist between thiaminase activities observed in dreissenids and the thiaminase activities in higher trophic levels of the Great Lakes food web. However, the extreme thiaminase activities observed in dreissenids from the Great Lakes may represent a serious unanticipated negative effect of these exotic species on Great Lakes ecosystems.

Phytoplankton composition modifies predator-driven life history evolution in Daphnia	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY												Organisms experience competing selective pressures, which can obscure the mechanisms driving evolution. Daphnia ambigua is found in lakes where a predator, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) either does (anadromous) or does not (landlocked) migrate between marine and freshwater. We previously reported an association between alewife variation and life history evolution in Daphnia. However, differences in alewife migration indirectly influence phytoplankton composition for Daphnia. In 'anadromous lakes', Daphnia are present in the spring and experience abundant high-quality green algae. Intense predation by young-of-the-year anadromous alewife quickly eliminates these Daphnia populations by early summer. Daphnia from 'landlocked lakes' and lakes without alewife ('no alewife lakes') are present during the spring and summer and are more likely to experience high concentrations of sub-optimal cyanobacteria during the summer. To explore links between predation, resources, and prey evolution, we reared third-generation laboratory-born Daphnia from all lake types on increasing cyanobacteria concentrations. We observed several significant 'lake type x resource' interactions whereby the differences among lake types depended upon cyanobacteria concentrations. Daphnia from anadromous lakes developed faster, were larger at maturation, produced more offspring, and had higher intrinsic rates of increase in the absence of cyanobacteria. Such trends disappeared or reversed as cyanobacteria concentration was increased because Daphnia from anadromous lakes were more strongly influenced by the presence of cyanobacteria. Our results argue that alewife migration and phytoplankton composition both play a role in Daphnia evolution.					; Post, David/A-6987-2009	Komatsu, Kimberly/0000-0001-7056-4547; Post, David/0000-0003-1434-7729													0269-7653	1573-8477				MAR	2014	28	2					397	411		10.1007/s10682-013-9666-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-013-9666-7													WOS:000331711600012
S	Bright, J	Rosenbaum, JG; Kaufman, DS			Bright, Jordon	Rosenbaum, JG; Kaufman, DS		Isotope and major-ion chemistry of groundwater in Bear Lake Valley, Utah and Idaho, with emphasis on the Bear River Range	PALEOENVIRONMENTS OF BEAR LAKE, UTAH AND IDAHO, AND ITS CATCHMENT	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Major-ion chemistry, strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86), stable isotope ratios (delta O-18, delta H-2), and tritium were analyzed for water samples from the southern Bear Lake Valley, Utah and Idaho, to characterize the types and distribution of groundwater sources and their relation to Bear Lake's pre-diversion chemistry. Four groundwater types were identified: (1) Ca-Mg-HCO3 water with Sr-87/Sr-86 values of similar to 0.71050 and modern tritium concentrations was found in the mountainous carbonate terrain of the Bear River Range. Magnesium (Mg) and bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations at Swan Creek Spring are discharge dependent and result from differential carbonate bedrock dissolution within the Bear River Range. (2) Cl-rich groundwater with elevated barium and strontium concentrations and Sr-87/Sr-86 values between 0.71021 and 0.71322 was found in the southwestern part of the valley. This groundwater discharges at several small, fault-controlled springs along the margin of the lake and contains solutes derived from the Wasatch Formation. (3) SO4-rich groundwater with Sr-87/Sr-86 values of similar to 0.70865, and lacking detectable tritium, discharges from two springs in the northeast quadrant of the study area and along the East Bear Lake fault. (4) Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4-Cl water with Sr-87/Sr-86 values of similar to 0.71060 and sub-modern tritium concentrations discharges from several small springs emanating from the Wasatch Formation on the Bear Lake Plateau. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values from springs and streams discharging in the Bear River Range fall along the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), but are more negative at the southern end of the valley and at lower elevations. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values from springs discharging on the Bear Lake Plateau plot on an evaporation line slightly below the GMWL. Stable isotope data suggest that precipitation falling in Bear Lake Valley is affected by orographic effects as storms pass over the Bear River Range, and by evaporation prior to recharging the Bear Lake Plateau aquifers. Approximately 99% of the solutes constituting Bear Lake's pre-diversion chemistry were derived from stream discharge and shallow groundwater sources located within the Bear River Range. Lake-marginal springs exposed during the recent low lake levels and springs and streams draining the Bear Lake Plateau did not contribute significantly to the pre-diversion chemistry of Bear Lake.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2450-8				2009	450						105	132		10.1130/2009.2450(04)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2009.2450(04)													WOS:000271276500005

Lake landscapes buffer nutrient flux and algal production in mountain watersheds	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 30, PT 3, PROCEEDINGS	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY - PROCEEDINGS				30th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	AUG 12-18, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol				In glaciated mountain landscapes, lakes and streams are linked in complex surface water networks. We analyzed hydrologic and nutrient fluxes at the lowest elevation lakes (basal lakes) in 5 glaciated watersheds in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho (USA) to test the hypothesis that higher watershed lakes buffer the spring snowmelt flux of nutrients to the lower watershed, thus stabilizing production processes low in the basal lake. High nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flux into lakes accompanied spring snowmelt in May and June. In watersheds with few lakes at higher elevations, nutrients flushed through the watershed 10-28 days faster with respect to water runoff than did watersheds with more lakes. Subsequent to the snowmelt pulse of nutrients, inflowing stream water with low nutrient content from lakeless upper watersheds actually diluted the water in basal lakes. In general, through most of the summer growing season, total nitrogen concentrations flowing out of the lakes were higher (mean, 240 mu g N/L) than in the inflows (mean, 80 mu g N/L), supporting our previous finding that during parts of the year lakes act as nutrient sources in watersheds rather than sinks (WURTSBAUGH et al. 2005). Phytoplankton biomass, as measured by chlorophyll a in lakes at the bottom of watersheds with many lakes. was lower and less variable from spring to summer (chlorophyll a range: 1.0-0.2 mu g/L) than in lakes in watersheds with few takes (range: 2.8-0.5 mu g/L). Together, these results support the hypothesis that the presence of lakes in surface water networks buffers nutrient pulses, leading to lower and less variable concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton. Landscape-level knowledge of lakes and streams in a watershed can consequently be used to predict both nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton in these mountain watersheds.

Local- and Regional-Scale Forcing of Glacier Mass Balance Changes in the Swiss Alps	REMOTE SENSING												Glacier mass variations are climate indicators. Therefore, it is essential to examine both winter and summer mass balance variability over a long period of time to address climate-related ice mass fluctuations. In this study, we analyze glacier mass balance components and hypsometric characteristics with respect to their interactions with local meteorological variables and remote large-scale atmospheric and oceanic patterns. The results show that all selected glaciers have lost their equilibrium condition in recent decades, with persistent negative annual mass balance trends and decreasing accumulation area ratios (AARs), accompanied by increasing air temperatures of >= +0.45 degrees C decade(-1). The controlling factor of annual mass balance is mainly attributed to summer mass losses, which are correlated with (warming) June to September air temperatures. In addition, the interannual variability of summer and winter mass balances is primarily associated to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Greenland Blocking Index (GBI), and East Atlantic (EA) teleconnections. Although climate parameters are playing a significant role in determining the glacier mass balance in the region, the observed correlations and mass balance trends are in agreement with the hypsometric distribution and morphology of the glaciers. The analysis of decadal frontal retreat using Landsat images from 1984 to 2014 also supports the findings of this research, highlighting the impact of lake formation at terminus areas on rapid glacier retreat and mass loss in the Swiss Alps.					; Butler, David/GLN-4557-2022; Gharehchahi, saeideh/AAH-9403-2021; Jensen, Jennifer/E-8158-2013; Bhardwaj, Anshuman/KZV-1140-2024	Gharehchahi, saeideh/0000-0001-7912-4484; Bhardwaj, Anshuman/0000-0002-2502-6384; Ballinger, Thomas/0000-0002-8722-1927; 														2072-4292				MAY	2021	13	10							1949	10.3390/rs13101949	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13101949													WOS:000662519200001

Atmospheric Concentrations and Wet/Dry Loadings of Mercury at the Remote Experimental Lakes Area, Northwestern Ontario, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant released from both natural and human sources. Here we compare long-term records of wet deposition loadings of total Hg (THg) in the open to dry deposition loadings of THg in throughfall and litterfall under four boreal mixedwood canopy types at the remote Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. We also present long-term records of atmospheric concentrations of gaseous elemental (GEM), gaseous oxidized (GOM), and particle bound (PBM) Hg measured at the ELA. We show that dry THg loadings in throughfall and litterfall are 2.7 to 6.1 times greater than wet THg loadings in the open. GEM concentrations showed distinct monthly and daily patterns, correlating positively in spring and summer with rates of gross ecosystem productivity and respiration. GOM and PBM concentrations were less variable throughout the year but were highest in the winter, when concentrations of anthropogenically sourced particles and gases were also high. Forest fires, Arctic air masses, and road salt also impacted GEM, GOM, and PBM concentrations at the ELA. A nested GEOS-Chem simulation for the ELA region produced a dry/wet deposition ratio of >5, suggesting that the importance of dry deposition in forested regions can be reasonably modeled by existing schemes for trace gases.					; St. Louis, Vincent/G-6842-2011; Lehnherr, Igor/D-5707-2012; Graydon, Jennifer/G-6853-2011; St. Pierre, Kyra/G-7969-2015; Emmerton, Craig/G-2900-2013; St.Pierre, Kyra/G-7969-2015; Sunderland, Elsie/D-5511-2014	Humphreys, Elyn/0000-0002-5397-2802; Emmerton, Craig/0000-0001-9511-9191; St. Pierre, Kyra/0000-0003-0981-920X; Amos, Helen/0000-0002-0297-6643; Sunderland, Elsie/0000-0003-0386-9548													0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 16	2019	53	14					8017	8026		10.1021/acs.est.9b01338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b01338								31250626					WOS:000476685500011

THE IMPORTANCE OF SHORE ROOMS IN THE LIFE OF THE BAIKAL SEAL (PUSA SIBIRICA GMELIN 1788, PINNIPEDIA). 1. A REVIEW	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												Literature information on the roles the summer rookeries play in the life cycle of the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica Gmelin 1788) is summarized and analyzed. Coastal rookeries are normally visited by relatively few animals, numbering hundreds. It was only in the "extreme year" 1981 in the seal life, when ice on Lake Baikal disappeared 2-3 weeks earlier than usual, that approximately 10% of the population visited the lay areas, and the population responded instantly to this event (thin fleshed, highly infertile). In the 1990s, the ice situation on Lake Baikal often resembled that of the "extreme year" (ice disappeared by June 1st), but nothing unusual happened to the population. Coastal rookeries are predominantly relaxation places, but sometimes they are used for shedding. The timing for the seal to move ashore and the number of rookeries, according to some students, is determined by the need to complete the shedding, but according to some others, by a complex of reasons, the main ones being climatic conditions. The shore beds have nothing to do with the trophic factor. Warm winters and early springs contribute to a rapid collapse of the ice sheet, the result being too little time for the seals to finish shedding and a forceful need to move to a solid substrate. There have been records of old rookeries being used repeatedly, as well as of new ones emerged, but no links to the high number of animals have been detected.					; Борисович, Александр/ABA-4085-2020; Vladimir, Fialkov/AAD-4361-2022	Kupcinskii, Aleksandr/0000-0001-8884-8636; 													0044-5134					MAY	2021	100	5					590	600		10.31857/S0044513421050111	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S0044513421050111													WOS:000668219900010
J	KADLEC, JA				KADLEC, JA			EFFECTS OF A DRAWDOWN ON A WATERFOWL IMPOUNDMENT	ECOLOGY												The changes in soil, water, vegetation, invertebrates, and waterfowl populations of Backus Lake impoundment in north central lower Mich, were studied. A definite increase in plant nutrients, especially soil nitrates, occurred during drawdown. Most favorable increase in fertility was obtained when organic portion of soil remained moist or very wet during drawdown. Invertebrate populations, a potential food supply for waterfowl, were considerably reduced after drawdown. Plant species composition was not notably affected. Many of submerged and floating-leaf species were reduced in abundance. Waterlilies (Nymphaceae) were little affected except in areas of severe drying. Water smartweed (Polygonum amphibium) and bushy pondweed (Naias flexilis) growth was luxuriant alter drawdown, apparently in response to increases in nutrients. Most emergent species spread and increased in abundance as a result of exposed soil seed bed. Waterfowl utilization of area increased in late summer of 1st year of reflooding. Observations indicated that brood production is closely associated with emergent cover of suitable density which persists through winter. Increased cover developed by 1958 drawdown in Backus Lake was submerged by reflooding and was not available in early spring of 1959. Use by breeding waterfowl increased in 1960 when newly developed emergent cover was available.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1962	43	2					267	+		10.2307/1931982	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931982													WOS:A1962C145400011

Abundance of migratory and wintering geese in relation to vegetation succession in man-made wetlands: the effects of grazing regimes	ARDEA												The man-made wetlands in young polders in The Netherlands are important stopover and wintering sites for geese. We studied trends in vegetation composition and goose density in two study areas. One was located in a nature reserve situated in a polder reclaimed from an estuary, the other in a reserve in a polder reclaimed from a freshwater lake. In the former we compared an area of spontaneous vegetation succession with a summer-grazed area. In the latter the effect of reed Phragmites australis cover and height on field selection of geese was studied in an area grazed year-round by cattle and horses. In both study areas the area of short grassland (reed cover about 1%, reed height <0.5 m) was found to be significantly positively related to the grazing density of cattle and horses. Migrating and wintering Greylag Geese Anser anser and Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis preferred to feed on these extensive short grasslands. In the ungrazed part of the study site in the reclaimed estuarine area, there was an inverse relation between goose density and the ousting of pioneer species of saline habitats and short grasses by tall species such as Calamagrostis epigejos, Phragmites australis, tall herbs and shrubs. Summer grazing by cattle and horses at stocking rates of about 0.4 to 0.9 animals/ha, retarded the vegetation succession to some extent, which resulted in a goose density being higher in the summer-grazed area than in the ungrazed area. The implications for management are that the more desalinated the area becomes and the higher its clay content, the higher the stocking rate must be to retard the vegetation succession.																			0373-2266						2010	98	3					319	328		10.5253/078.098.0306	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/078.098.0306													WOS:000286546300006

An unusual lake outburst flood event was observed at Wolf Creek, a small tributary of the Yukon River. The event was focused at the outlet of Coal Lake the only major storage element in the basin. During the unusually cold January of 1996 ice growth at the outlet of Coal Lake created an ice dam which progressively grew through aufies formation as the lake levels increased. The ice dam failed in late April approximately 9 days after the onset of mean daily positive temperatures sending a significant flood wave downstream. This event was in excess of 1996 freshet flows which occurred more than one month later. There are three hydrometric stations on Wolf Creek however these were not activated until the recession of the outburst event. A water balance was carried out to reconstruct this flood event using observed lake levels for the containment period, the recorded recession limbs of hydrographs at the Coal Lake hydrometric station and a downstream hydrometric station, winter recession flows at an upstream hydrometric station and personal observation. The analyses indicated that the outburst event was greater in magnitude than the subsequent freshet event. ln addition to facilitating the reconstruction of the annual hydrograph, the analyses provides valuable information on a little known streamflow generation mechanism in small subarctic basins with lake storage.																			0161-0589						1997							279	288																WOS:000071608400028

The network was divided into five regional groups based on geography, tree species, and length of record: the eastern Rockies, northern Saskatchewan, central Manitoba, southern Manitoba, and northwestern Ontario. Regional tree-ring records are primarily related to summer moisture and drought conditions, and are less responsive to droughts caused by deficits in winter precipitation. These summer-sensitive data are not linearly related to major modes of climate variability, including ENSO and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), which primarily affect the climate of western Canada during winter. Extended drought records inferred from tree rings indicate that drought on the Canadian Prairies has exhibited considerable spatial heterogeneity over the last several centuries. For northern Saskatchewan and northwestern Ontario, intervals of persistently low tree growth during the twentieth century were just as long as or longer than low-growth intervals in the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. Longer records from southern Alberta suggest that the most intense dry spell in that area during the last 500 yr occurred during the 1720s. At the eastern side of the prairies, the longest dry event is centered around 1700 and may coincide with low lake stands in Manitoba, Minnesota, and North Dakota. Although the Canadian Prairies were dry at times during the 1500s, there is no regional analog to the sixteenth-century "megadroughts'' that affected much of the western United States and northern Mexico.

Moisture origin and stable isotope characteristics of precipitation in southeast Siberia	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The paper presents oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of 284 precipitation event samples systematically collected in Irkutsk, in the Baikal region (southeast Siberia), between June 2011 and April 2017. This is the first high-resolution dataset of stable isotopes of precipitation from this poorly studied region of continental Asia, which has a high potential for isotope-based palaeoclimate research. The dataset revealed distinct seasonal variations: relatively high delta O-18 (up to -4 parts per thousand) and delta D (up to -40 parts per thousand) values characterize summer air masses, and lighter isotope composition (-41 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and -322 parts per thousand for delta D) is characteristic of winter precipitation. Our results show that air temperature mainly affects the isotope composition of precipitation, and no significant correlations were obtained for precipitation amount and relative humidity. A new temperature dependence was established for weighted mean monthly precipitation: +0.50 parts per thousand/degrees C (r(2) = 0.83; p n = 55) for delta O-18 and +3.8 parts per thousand/degrees C (r(2) = 0.83, p < 0.01; n = 55) for delta D. Secondary fractionation processes (e.g., contribution of recycled moisture) were identified mainly in summer from low d excess. Backward trajectories assessed with the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model indicate that precipitation with the lowest mean delta O-18 and delta D values reaches Irkutsk in winter related to moisture transport from the Arctic. Precipitation originating from the west/southwest with the heaviest mean isotope composition reaches Irkutsk in summer, thus representing moisture transport across Eurasia. Generally, moisture transport from the west, that is, the Atlantic Ocean predominates throughout the year. A comparison of our new isotope dataset with simulation results using the European Centre/Hamburg version 5 (ECHAM5)-wiso climate model reveals a good agreement of variations in delta O-18 (r(2) = 0.87; p n = 55) and air temperature (r(2) = 0.99; p n = 71). However, the ECHAM5-wiso model fails to capture observed variations in d excess (r(2) = 0.14; p < 0.01; n = 55). This disagreement can be partly explained by a model deficit of capturing regional hydrological processes associated with secondary moisture supply in summer.

J	Meijer, ML; Hosper, H				Meijer, ML; Hosper, H			Effects of biomanipulation in the large and shallow Lake Wolderwijd, The Netherlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Cascades in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Lakes	AUG 20-25, 1995	WARSAW, POLAND	Inst Ecol, Polish Acad Sci, Univ Warsaw, Polish Hydrobiol Soc				Since the early seventies, Lake Wolderwijd (2650 ha, mean depth 1.5 m) suffered from cyanobacterial blooms, turbid water and a poor submerged vegetation as a result of eutrophication. From 1981 onwards the lake was flushed with water low in phosphorus and high in calcium bicarbonate. Total-P and chlorophyll a in the lake more than halved, but Secchi depth in summer increased from 0.20 to 0.30 m only. In the hope of triggering a shift from the algae-dominated turbid water state to a macrophyte-dominated clear water state, the lake was biomanipulated during winter 1990/1991. The fish stock, mainly bream (Abramis brama) and roach (Rutilus rutilus), was reduced from 205 to 45 kg ha(-1). In May 1991, 575 000 (217 ind ha(-1)) pike fingerlings (Esox lucius) were introduced. In spring 1991 the lake cleared as a result of grazing by Daphnia galeata. The clear water phase lasted for only six weeks. Macrophytes did not respond as expected and most of the young pike died. However, from 1991 to 1993 the submerged vegetation is gradually changing. Characeae began to spread over the lake (from 28 ha in 1991 to 438 ha in 1993). The water over the Chara meadows was clear, probably as a result of increased net sedimentation in these areas. It is hypothesized that expansion of the Chara meadows might ultimately result in a shift of the whole lake to a lasting clear water state. In order to promote the Chara, the fish stock reductions aimed at a spring clear water phase should be continued.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 17	1997	342						335	349		10.1023/A:1017088701621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017088701621													WOS:A1997WZ13900036

The dynamic system consisted of natural water with throughflow of 4.5 mL min(-1) and bottom sediment from a clean oligohumic lake in Central Finland. Duckweed (Lemna sp.) as plant material, lake mussel (Anodonta piscinalis) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius) as test animals were included in the test device. Tetrachloroguaiacol (TeCG) was dissolved at start to water to make 2 mu g L(-1) concentration. The same concentration of TeCG was maintained in inflow water. After static and dynamic pre-tests, a dynamic four weeks test at 15 degrees C was run with natural water taken in winter. Then, two dynamic four weeks experiments in three parallel devices with water taken in summer (15 degrees C) and in autumn (10 degrees C) were done. Concentration of TeCG in outflow water and its partition between sediment and water came to an equilibrium. Contents in mussel and fish reached no equilibria during the tests. Six chlorophenolic metabolites of TeCG were identified, but most of the TeCG had reacted to nonidentified degradation products. The degradation rate of TeCG was more dependent on the time of year of water sampling than on the test temperature.																			0045-6535					OCT	1995	31	8					3857	3871		10.1016/0045-6535(95)00258-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(95)00258-A													WOS:A1995TB34700006

A general one-dimensional vertical ecosystem model of Lake Shira (Russia, Khakasia): description, parametrization and analysis	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												A one-dimensional ecological model of the meromictic brackish Lake Shira (Russia, Khakasia) was developed. The model incorporates state-of-the-art knowledge about the functioning of the lake ecosystem using the most recent field observations and ideas from PCLake, a general ecosystem model of shallow freshwater lakes. The model of Lake Shira presented here takes into account the vertical dynamics of biomasses of the main species of algae, zooplankton and microbial community, as well as the dynamics of oxygen, detritus, nutrients and hydrogen sulphide from spring to autumn. Solar radiation, temperature and diffusion are modelled using real meteorological data. The parameters of the model were calibrated to the field data, after applying different methods of sensitivity analysis to the model. The resulting patterns of phytoplankton and nutrients dynamics show a good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the field observations during the whole summer season. Results are less satisfactory with respect to the vertical distribution of zooplankton biomass. We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that the current model does not take the sex and age structure of zooplankton into account. The dynamics of oxygen, hydrogen sulphide and the modelled positions of the chemocline and thermocline are again in good agreement with field data. This resemblance confirms the validity of the approach we took in the model regarding the main physical, chemical and ecological processes. This general model opens the way for checking various hypotheses on the functioning of the Lake Shira ecosystem in future investigations and for analysing options for management of this economically important lake.

J	Pace, ML; Cole, JJ				Pace, ML; Cole, JJ			Synchronous variation of dissolved organic carbon and color in lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Temporal variation in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and water color (light absorption at 440 nm) was measured in 20 lakes in northern Michigan that varied in DOC, pH, morphometry, and relative productivity as indicated by chlorophyll and total phosphorus (TP). Monthly observations during May-August over 6 yr revealed that DOC and color varied by 6- and 28-fold among lakes and varied substantially through time within lakes. The pattern of temporal variation differed among years but was synchronous among lakes. Of the 190 possible correlations among lake time series, most were positive for DOC (158) and color (160), and 50% of the positive correlations were significant (P < 0.05). Other variables, such as total phosphorus, chlorophyll, and pH, were less synchronous and had fewer significant positive correlations (13-25%). Temporal dynamics in DOC and color were related to ice-out date as well as spring and summer precipitation. Years of late ice-out and high spring rain were associated with high DOC and color in spring. A summer drought in one year lead to declines in color (up to 40%;) and DOC (up to 38%) in nearly all of the lakes. The common temporal dynamics of DOC and color were most likely the result of climatic conditions that affected loading of allochthonous carbon as well as losses due to photodegradation. The variations in DOC were sufficient to cause large changes in light penetration, standing stocks of carbon, and ecosystem metabolism.

Fluvial tufa evidence of Late Pleistocene wet intervals from Santa Barbara, California, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Past pluvials in the western United States provide valuable context for understanding regional hydroclimate variability. Here we report evidence of conditions substantially wetter than today from fluvial tufa deposits located near Zaca Lake, Santa Barbara County, California that have been dated by radiocarbon (C-14) and Infra-Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL). Two successions of tufa deposition occur within a small catchment that drains Miocene Monterey Formation bedrock: 1) a fluvial deposit (0-0.5 m thick, 200 m in extent) that formed along a narrow valley below a modern spring, and 2) a perched deposit similar to 10 m higher (2 m thick, 15 m in extent). IRSL and radiocarbon dating of the perched carbonates suggest at least two episodes of carbonate growth: one at 19.4 +/- 2.4 (1 sigma.) through 17.8 +/- 2.8 (1 sigma) ka and another at 11.9 +/- 1.5 (1 sigma.) ka verified with a charcoal C-14 age of 10.95 +/- 0.12 (2 sigma) cal ka BP. The relationship between the perched and fluvial spring deposits is inferred to represent a drop in the water table of more than 10 m associated with a transition from a wet climate in the late glacial to a dry Holocene today. The wet period indicated by the perched tufa deposit between 19.4 and 17.8 ka is relatively consistent with other California climate records both north and south of Zaca Lake. However, tufa growth ca. 12 to 11 ka demonstrates wet conditions occurred as far south as Zaca Lake during the Younger Dryas event, in contrast to climate records farther south in Lake Elsinore that indicate a drying trend through this interval. A small shift north in the average position of the winter season storm track could explain wet winters at Zaca while at the same time generating dry winters at Lake Elsinore, similar to 275 km southwest of Zaca. If true, these data indicate that rather small latitudinal shifts in the average winter season storm track can produce large changes in regional hydroclimate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An unusual lake outburst flood event was observed at Wolf Creek, a small tributary of the Yukon River. The event was focused at the outlet of Coal Lake the only major storage element in the basin. During the unusually cold January of 1996 ice growth at the outlet of Coal Lake created an ice dam which progressively grew through aufies formation as the lake levels increased. The ice dam failed in late April approximately 9 days after the onset of mean daily positive temperatures sending a significant flood wave downstream. This event was in excess of 1996 freshet flows which occurred more than one month later. There are three hydrometric stations on Wolf Creek however these were not activated until the recession of the outburst event. A water balance was carried out to reconstruct this flood event using observed lake levels for the containment period, the recorded recession limbs of hydrographs at the Coal Lake hydrometric station and a downstream hydrometric station, winter recession flows at an upstream hydrometric station and personal observation. The analyses indicated that the outburst event was greater in magnitude than the subsequent freshet event. In addition to facilitating the reconstruction of the annual hydrograph, the analyses provides valuable information on a little known streamflow generation mechanism in small subarctic basins with lake storage.																									1997							279	288																WOS:000083552000028
J	Webb, DJ; Robarts, RD; Prepas, EE				Webb, DJ; Robarts, RD; Prepas, EE			Influence of extended water column mixing during the first 2 years of hypolimnetic oxygenation on the phytoplankton community of Amisk Lake, Alberta	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The phytoplankton community, physical variables, and nutrient and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were monitored during the first two of six open-water seasons of hypolimnetic oxygenation in double-basined Amisk Lake, Alberta. Deep mixing of the water column in the treated basin (Z(max) = 34 m) in spring was enhanced by hypolimnetic oxygenation. Oxygenation began in June 1988, when stratification was likely already established, but subsequent year-round treatment favoured an extended spring diatom bloom (Asterionella formosa and Cyclotella spp.), followed by a delay in the development of, and reduction in the severity of, cyanobacterial blooms (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Anabaena flos-aquae) in 1989. Historically, mean summer Chl a and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the euphotic zone (0-6 m) of the treated basin were 15.9 +/- 1.6 and 33.5 +/- 1.5 mu g.L-1, respectively, indicating a eutrophic lake. In 1988 and 1989, mean summer Chl a (10.0 +/- 0.6 and 8.1 +/- 0.7 mu g.L-1, respectively) and TP concentrations (29.0 +/- 0.5 and 22.5 +/- 0.9 mu g.L-1, respectively) in this stratum were lower than historic values (P < 0.05), indicating that the trophic status of Amisk Lake had shifted towards mesotrophy.																			0706-652X					SEP	1997	54	9					2133	2145		10.1139/f97-120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f97-120													WOS:A1997YH98200019

Exploring the spatiotemporal water quality variations and their influencing factors in a large floodplain lake in China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China. It is characterized by dramatic hydrodynamic fluctuations which result in complex water quality variations. To explore the water quality status we used the fuzzy matter element evaluation (FME) model to integrate key water quality indicators into a rank value. Monthly monitoring data from 18 sampling sites in the main lake and in the inflowing rivers collected during June 2010 to December 2015 were used to evaluate the water quality variations at spatial, seasonal and annual scales in the Poyang Lake. The results showed that the water quality status was generally the best in the wet summer season and the poorest in dry winter season. In addition, two considerably different spatial water status clusters were identified. A significant trend of water quality deterioration was observed during dry winter season for high pollution cluster and during summer for both clusters the lake from 2010 to 2015, which makes the lake more vulnerable to algal blooms. Random forest (RF) model showed that hydrological conditions together with water quality of inflow rivers yield 54% and 51% of the variation in water quality variations for low-and high-polluted clusters, respectively. Importance analysis based on RF indicated that hydrological conditions contributed the most to water quality variations in Poyang Lake, followed by the pollutants from adjacent sub-basins. This study provides new insights into when and where to control pollution sources of Poyang Lake.

J	Borkholder, BD; Parsons, BG				Borkholder, BD; Parsons, BG			Relationship between electrofishing catch rates of age-0 walleyes and water temperature in Minnesota lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We compared catch data for age-0 walleyes Stizostedion vitreum captured by night electrofishing 18 Minnesota lakes sampled over a wide range of water temperatures (4-25degreesC) throughout the fall 1996. The relationship between electrofishing catch per hour (CPE) of age-0 walleyes and temperature showed a curvilinear pattern, CPE rising and peaking at 18.6degreesC and declining thereafter, as water temperature cooled throughout the fall. Three different patterns of CPE were observed within subsets of the data, but peak CPE generally occurred at intermediate water temperatures, and declines in CPE generally occurred when water temperature dropped below 10degreesC. Mean lengths differed significantly between August and September in all but three lakes, but did not differ significantly between September and October, except in two lakes. For managers needing to assess age-0 walleye abundance before stocking advanced fall fingerlings, our data suggest that fall assessments should target water temperatures between 20degreesC and 10degreesC. If the size of age-0 walleyes entering the first winter must be determined, assessments should be performed towards the end of September but before the water temperature falls below 10degreesC. For reliable long-term data sets on individual lakes, we recommend that managers plan sampling schedules so that individual lakes arc sampled each year at similar temperature ranges.																			0275-5947					MAY	2001	21	2					318	325		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0318:RBECRO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0318:RBECRO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289100005

Evaluating the dynamics of groundwater, lakebed transport, nutrient inflow and algal blooms in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Transport of nutrients to lakes can occur via surface-water inflow, atmospheric deposition, groundwater (GW) inflow and benthic processes. Identifying and quantifying within-lake nutrient sources and recycling processes is challenging. Prior studies in hypereutrophic Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, USA, indicated that similar to 60% of the early summer phosphorus (P) load to the lake was internal and hypothesized to be lakebed sediment release. Dynamic nutrient transport processes were examined to better characterize the nutrient sources. One-dimensional heat transport models calibrated to observed lakebed temperatures and a cross-sectional GW flow model provided estimates of GW-inflow rates that were greatest in spring and decreased through summer. One-dimensional solute transport models calibrated to observed lakebed pore-water dissolved silica (Si) and dissolved phosphate-phosphorus (DP) concentrations indicated that nutrients were transported from the lakebed by advection, diffusion, and enhanced mixing by benthic organisms and waves, and that DP removal occurred near the lakebed interface. Estimated water, Si, DP and total-phosphorus (TP) budgets indicated that GW contributed 21% of lake water inflow and at least 26, 20 and 16% of total Si, DP and TP inflow, respectively, when conservatively assuming background GW nutrient concentrations. However, lakebed GW(LGW) is enriched in nutrients during flow through lakebed sediment and the estimated GW contribution increased to 29 (33), 49 (67) and 43% (61%) of total Si, DP and TP inflow, respectively, if 20% (50%) of GW inflow to the lake was assumed to have LGW concentrations. Net nutrient inflow to the lake was greatest in spring and coincident with the annual diatom bloom. Inflowing dissolved nutrients appear to be assimilated by diatoms during the spring and become available for the summer Aphanizomenon flos-aquae bloom when the diatoms senesce. Thus, nutrient-enriched GW inflow and nutrient recycling by successive algal blooms must be considered when evaluating internal nutrient loading to lakes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The impact of topdressing activities on cyanobacterial bloom phenology (key parameters for depicting bloom process), however, has not been verified. Taking Lake Erhai, a typical eutrophic plateau lake, as an example, this study explored the spatio-temporal characteristics of phenological metrics and coverage extent for surface cyanobacterial bloom, based on phycocyanin pigment series retrieved from satellite and investigated the bloom responses to environmental forces. The results showed that higher intensity and earlier onset bloom with a larger coverage extent mainly occurred in the northern region. We identified three distinct cyanobacterial bloom growth patterns with large inter-annual variability in their bloom initiation timing (BIT). The earlier BIT is highly linked to elevated total nitrogen level and decreased wind speed. The bloom amplitude is mainly related to summer TN in 2003-2011, while associated with winter TN/TP ratio (TN, total nitrogen; TP, total phosphorus) during 2016-2019. Additionally, we found direct evidence linking agricultural topdressing and the BIT of a typical autumn bloom. After one week for the topdressing practice, the BITs lagged by approximately average 23 days, coinciding with high rainfall intensity. Our research demonstrates the topdressing activity should be reduced through agricultural planting adjustments. High TN and TP loss crops should be prohibited; planting adjustments should decrease high TP loss crop plantings in response to regional environmental forces.					; Xu, QiangQiang/MFJ-3601-2025; Hou, Xuejiao/IYT-1780-2023; Yang, Shangbo/JYQ-1862-2024; Lu, Jianzhong/E-5698-2013	Yang, Shangbo/0009-0003-1837-393X; Lu, Jianzhong/0000-0002-6432-8481; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2021	594								125952	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125952		JAN 2021											WOS:000641589600059
J	Small, EE; Sloan, LC; Nychka, D				Small, EE; Sloan, LC; Nychka, D			Changes in surface air temperature caused by desiccation of the Aral Sea	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												A statistical method for establishing the cause-effect relationship between a land surface modification and some component of observed climatic change is presented. This method aids attribution in two ways. First, the climatic changes that are unique to the area influenced by some land surface modification are identified. This isolates changes caused by the spatially restricted forcing from changes caused by other factors. Second, most of the short-term climatic variability in the records from the affected area is removed based on information from the surrounding region. This makes it possible to identify smaller climatic changes. This method is used to identify the changes in surface air temperature that have resulted from desiccation of the Aral Sea (1960-97). Desiccation has weakened the "lake effect" of the Aral Sea, so regional climatic changes are expected. Substantial temperature trends, unrelated to desiccation, are observed across a broad region of central Asia (similar to 2000 km) between 1960 and 1997. These trends are similar in magnitude to the changes from desiccation. These trends are removed from the records from the Aral region because they would enhance or offset the local temperature changes caused by desiccation. There is also substantial year-to-year temperature variability that is spatially coherent across central Asia. The method used here removes similar to 80%-90% of this short-term variability in the observed temperature records from the Aral region. This lowers the climate change detection limit from similar to3 degrees -8 degreesC to similar to1 degrees- 2 degreesC, which improves the identification of the spatial extent of the desiccation-induced changes. The climate records from around the Aral Sea show dramatic temperature changes between 1960 and 1997, once regionally coherent trends and variability are removed. Mean, maximum, and minimum temperature near the Aral Sea have changed by up to 6 degreesC. Warming (cooling) is observed during spring and summer (autumn and winter), as expected to accompany the diminished lake effect caused by desiccation. The magnitude of temperature changes decreases with increasing distance from the 1960 shoreline, with changes extending up to similar to 200 km from the shoreline in the downwind direction. An increase in diurnal temperature range of 2 degrees -3 degreesC is observed in all months, demonstrating a weakening of the lake's damping effect on the diurnal temperature cycle.					; Small, eric/K-6007-2015	Small, ERIC/0000-0002-5010-4954; Nychka, Douglas/0000-0003-1387-3356; 													0894-8755						2001	14	3					284	299		10.1175/1520-0442(2001)014<0284:CISATC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2001)014<0284:CISATC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000166836400004

These lipids are abundant in the drip water. Their compositions are dominated by lower-molecular-weight nC16:0, nC18:0 and nC14:0 acids, together with mono-unsaturated nC18:1, nC16:1 and nC14:1. Analysis of one water sample revealed marked differences between the dissolved and particulate fractions. The dissolved fraction contains total fatty acids one order of magnitude higher than that of the particulate fraction. The distributional patterns of the fatty acids suggest that microbes living in the overlying soils and/or groundwater system contribute most fatty acids to the drip water. This 2-a monitoring experiment reveals that the abundance of mono-unsaturated fatty acids relative to the saturated homologues (nC16:1/nC16:0 and nC18:1/nC18:0) relate inversely to the changes of synchronous external air temperature. Higher values occur under cold conditions (winter/spring), while lower values appear in warm intervals (summer). Further studies are needed to elucidate the dynamic processes by which the external temperature affects fatty acids in drip water and to confirm the potential application of fatty acid ratios such as nC16:1/nC16:0 and nC18:1/nC18:0 in paleotemperature reconstructions.

We performed a seasonal regional survey (2004-2006, phytoplankton regime) across the different aquatic systems in the wetland. Gamma diversity was 254 species. Beta diversity was 2.53 in late spring, 2.49 in winter, and was lowest in summer (2.05) when the wetland was over flooded. Alpha diversity (mean richness) ranged between 29 and 50 species. Multiple regressions showed that phytoplankton alpha diversity (richness, Shannon-Wiener, evenness, and Simpson diversity index) responded to dissolved inorganic nitrogen, suspended solids, light attenuation, and pH. Nutrients also explained well the distribution of phytoplankton functional groups. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations were usually limiting in the shallow lakes, whereas phosphate concentration was always high. Light attenuation was mostly caused by high suspended solids and high humic substances. We also re-analyzed data from a survey performed during a free-floating plant regime (1998-2000); the dense macrophyte cover attenuates most incoming light into the water column. Compared with the phytoplankton regime, the free-floating plant regime had markedly lower chlorophyll, lower alpha, higher beta (high heterogeneity among habitats with and without macrophytes), and similar gamma diversity.

Wetland methane emissions dominated by plant-mediated fluxes: Contrasting emissions pathways and seasons within a shallow freshwater subtropical wetland	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Wetlands represent the largest natural source of methane; however, very few studies have simultaneously quantified the three main atmospheric flux pathways (i.e., diffusive, ebullition, and plant-mediated). Unlike better-studied northern hemisphere systems, many Australian subtropical wetlands undergo extreme wet/dry oscillations, which may strongly impact methane dynamics. We assessed diurnal methane emissions of multiple pathways during three distinct seasonal events within an Australian freshwater wetland. Six-fold higher methane emissions occurred during summer compared to autumn floods (which followed an extensive dry-period) and winter/cool conditions. Over three seasons, diffusion represented the highest average areal fluxes (25.9 +/- 73.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) but were within range of fluxes through water lily aerenchyma (20.8 +/- 41.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Average ebullition rates were 5.5 +/- 9.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Water column CH4 displayed high spatiotemporal variability, ranging from 55.0 to 253.5 mu mol L-1. Time series delta C-13-CH4 isotope measurements revealed an oxidation fraction of ~ 15% at night-time and ~ 36% during day-time, and night-time diffusive fluxes were consistently ~ three-fold higher than day-time fluxes. By aggregating seasons and weighting for changes in lily coverage, plant-mediated fluxes accounted for ~ 59% of the annual methane emissions, whereas ebullition and diffusion each accounted for ~ 20%. The up-scaled annual area-weighted wetland methane flux (combined pathways) was 27.3 +/- 36.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1). We contend that water lilies (Nymphaea sp.) are the significant carbon source, mediator, and conduit for methane fluxes in this system, and the extremely large seasonal variability of methane emissions reflect dynamic redox oscillations driven by oscillating wet and dry conditions.

Several researchers present the result of long-term monitoring programmes and there are observations of rare species (but only those accepted by the Rareties Committee) or the more regular ones recorded in unusual numbers, or outside the normal dates of presence in the region. There were spells of severely cold weather in February 1986 and again, for the 3rd consecutive winter, in January 1987, this latter being the more severe of the two. Flamingos and egrets suffered less than in January 1985 but passerines were hard hit, particularly Cetti''s and Fan-tailed warblers and Beared Tits. Rainfall over the two years was quite high and as a result the salinity of the Vaccares lagoon dropped from 33 g/l to only 20 g/l by the end of 1987. All european grebes have been recorded in the delta and their numbers have increased on the Vaccares where 1000 or more Great-crested and aound 3 000 Black-necked were censued both years. The Grey Heron breeding population continues to increase and there were a record 891 pairs censused in the Camargue area in 1986. In the winter the Great White Heron is now a regular visitor with up to 35 individuals. Storks are still regular on migration with 8 Black and 43 White in autumn 1987. Record numbers of flamingos were again breeding in 1986 and 1987 with 20 000 and 17 5000 pairs respectively and a record 8 950 chicks raised in 1986. In 1987, only 2 200 chicks were raised because of disturbance caused by a child''s balloon blown onto the breeding island during hatching. The banding programme continues and 600 chicks were marked each year. During the cold spell of January 1987 about 100 flamigos died, one of the victims being marked with an Iranian ring from Lake Rezaiyeh. Waterfowl counts revealed record numbers of Shelducks in February, with 2 745 and 1986 and 3 950 in 1987. The Mute Swan breeding population continues to increase in the area and the Bewick''s peaked at 105 in Janauary 1986. A small flock of Grey-lag Geese now winters in the Camargue and one bird has been seen wearing a Swedish ring. Midwinter counts of ducks and coots have now been made over 24 consecutive seasons. Although Gadwall and Shoelver numbers have incresaed in recent years the overall numbers of ducks have decreased for the thirteenth consecutive winter. This decline is attributed mainly to excessive hunting and an increase in the salinity of Camargue lagoons. Other notorious winter visitors to the delta have been Sea and Booted Eagles in 1986 and 1987, and 7 cranes in 1986. Amongst the rarer waders is the 4th record of a Pectoral Sandpiper, a spring report of Buff-breasted Sandpiper and several observations of Wilson''s Phalarope, Terek Sandpiper and Black-winged Pratincole. Finally, a record 193 pairs of Slender-billed Gulls bred in 1987 and 35 pairs of Mediterranean gulls in 1986.																			0249-7395					APR-JUN	1989	44	2					165	189																WOS:A1989U146600003

Winter accumulation of acidic pharmaceuticals in a Swedish river	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this study, seasonal variations in the concentration profile of four analgesics and one lipid regulator were monitored on their way from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, along a river, and into a lake. From December 2007 to December 2008, water samples were collected monthly (n = 12) from an upstream point, the effluent, four downstream points of the WWTP, and at the point where the river merges with the lake, and the concentrations of ibuprofen, naproxen, bezafibrate, diclofenac, and ketoprofen were determined. The analytical methodology involved solid-phase extraction of the target compounds from water samples followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry for compound separation and detection. The studied pharmaceuticals were found in the effluent at concentrations ranging from 31 to 1,852 ng l(-1) depending on the season. In the river and lake, the concentrations were much lower (6-400 ng l(-1)) mainly due to dilution but also to a season-dependent contribution from natural transformation processes. The mean mass flow of all analgesics was highest during winter while the highest mean mass flow of the lipid regulator bezafibrate was observed in spring. The WWTP is the main source of the target compounds in the aquatic environment. The observed winter accumulation signifies the importance of natural transformation processes, which can only be estimated based on mass flow data, on the fate of pharmaceuticals in the environment.

Response of Zooplankton to Restoration and Climate Warming in Alte Donau	ALTE DONAU: SUCCESSFUL RESTORATION AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT - AN ECOSYSTEM CASE STUDY OF A SHALLOW URBAN LAKE	Aquatic Ecology Series											Lake restoration is commonly assessed by changes in water transparency, nutrients and biomass of phytoplankton, while information about changes in zooplankton that is triggered by lake management is often missing. In our 19-year study we used rotifers and crustaceans to document the effect of restoration measures on zooplankton in the oxbow lake Alte Donau, a former side-arm of the Danube River which is most popular for recreation and angler (cyprinid-dominated shallow water). The record covers four management periods: the period before restoration, the restoration (including years of chemical phosphate precipitation by Riplox treatment), the re-establishment of macrophytes and the sustained ` stable conditions'. We found the highest abundance of all zooplankton in the first Riplox-year, with decreasing zooplankton abundance in following periods associated with the decline of phytoplankton. In the long term, the main compositional change related to a shift from a cladoceran-rotifer-rich to a copepod-rotifer-rich zooplankton assemblage. Thus, the large-bodied zooplankton shifted from a community composed of mainly filter-feeding herbivorous cladocerans under eutrophic algal-turbid conditions to mainly selective-feeding omnivorous and herbivorous copepods under mesotrophic transparent-water conditions. While the carbon ratio between zoo-and phytoplankton increased significantly during the first three periods and remained high under ` stable conditions', the mean body size of zooplankton did not exhibit a long-term trend. Short-term increases of large-bodied zooplankton coincided with an intermittent increase of calanoid copepod abundance (Eudiaptomus gracilis) during the chemical treatment concomitant with a drastic phytoplankton biomass reduction and the occurrence of large-bodied cladocerans (Simocephalus vetulus and Sida crystallina) in some years with re-established underwater vegetation. Besides the main response of zooplankton to the 'bottom up' control that was triggered by the reduction of phytoplankton food supply by one order of magnitude, we studied the zooplankton response to climate change. The impact of climate warming was evident from intra-annual coincidence of the climate signal (NAODJFM) and water temperature (WT) in winter and early spring, the increase of surface water temperature (SWT) by 1.52 degrees C per decade in April and the prolongation of the warm period (SWT > 22 degrees C) by 10.5 days per decade in summer. This prolongation of the warm season seemed to support the summer development of the medusa stage of freshwater jellyfish (Craspedacusta sowerbii). During the transition from spring to summer, the progressively earlier clear-water phase followed two trends. The first period with a 33-day earlier clear-water phase per decade coincided with pronounced ecosystem changes from a high to a low eutrophic state created by chemical restoration measures. The second period with a moderate earlier progression of 7 days per decade was accompanied by a further, slight TP decrease associated with the re-establishment of macrophytes. When comparing rotifers, cladocerans, calanoid and cyclopoid copepods, the latter group benefits most from seasonal temperature increases and climate warming.					; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021	Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043; 													1573-4595	2543-005X	978-3-319-93270-5; 978-3-319-93268-2				2018	10						163	212		10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5_11	10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5												WOS:000459447700011

The contribution of zooplankton to disappearance of insecticides in environmental water was evaluated as the ratio of insecticide disappearance rate caused by zooplankton to the disappearance rate in lake water. The tolerance of S. tenellus and O. davisae to phenthoate and diazinon was lower than the tolerance to other tested insecticides, such as cyanophos, salithion, malathion, fenitrothion and dichlofenthion. Disappearance of malathion and dichlofenthion from sterilized lakes water and artificial brackishwater in the presence of zooplankton were faster than those of other chemicals. R Malathion-degrading activity of zooplankton was high and the activity for dichlofenthion was low. The insecticide-degrading abilities depended on insecticide types. The maximum contributions of zooplankton to disappearances of several insecticides in Lake Shinjiko were estimated as follows: 0.4% for fenitrothion, 8.1% for malathion and 3.4%, for salithion in spring, and 0.6% for fenitrothion, 4.6% for cyanophos and 0.8% for diazinon in autumn. The maximum contributions of zooplankton to disappearance of several insecticides in Lake Nakanoumi were estimated as follows: 0.1% for fenitrothion, 0.7% for malathion and 1.9% for salithion in spring, and 0.1% for fenitrothion, 2.7% for cyanophos and 1.2% for diazinon in autumn.																			0385-1559						1995	20	4					503	512																WOS:A1995TF72500008

We estimated abundances of hatchery and wild smolts during 1975-1990 for both lakes based on stocking rates, survival schedules, and discrimination of the proportion of the lake population that was naturally recruited. Recruitment of wild steelhead varied as a function of presmolt winter severity in both lakes. Wild smolts accounted for 6-44% (during 1982-1989) and 18-33% (during 1978-1985) of total annual smolt production in Lakes Michigan and Ontario, respectively. We developed an age-structured population model with separate accounting for run timing (summer, fall, and spring) using the proportions of life history stages observed at weirs and estimated adult survival rates. We summarized data on growth, diet, water temperature, and energy contents of predator and prey to model lakewide prey consumption in both lakes during 1975-1990. Lakewide prey consumption by steelhead amounted to 9,500 tonnes . year-1 in 1987 in Lake Michigan and 2,200 tonnes . year-1 in 1990 in Lake Ontario. Because of their limited dietary reliance on alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax and relatively low stocking density compared with other salmonines, steelhead consumed only 4% of available alewife production and 2% of total smelt production in 1987 in Lake Michigan. Although estimates of alewife production in Lake Ontario are presently unavailable, measures of alewife biomass in 1990 in Lake Ontario indicate that steelhead probably had a negligible effect on these prey fish. Steelhead consumed 2% of total rainbow smelt production in Lake Ontario in 1990. Population biomass conversion efficiency (16.1%) and production-to-biomass ratio (mean, 1.18) for Lake Michigan steelhead are low compared with those of sympatric Oncorhynchus species. Sensitivity analysis of the population submodel indicated that the most sensitive parameters were lake survival and size at stocking.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	1993	122	5					977	1001		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0977:MSPEIL>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0977:MSPEIL>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993MJ44000026

This reconstruction is based on pollen, stable isotope, mineralogical and chemical analyses of sediments, made with a time resolution of 1-4 yr. It reveals a sequence of abrupt climatic changes which preceded and followed the major warming around 11500 cal BP. Our data show that the warming period was preceded by a 30-yr-long phase of increased winter and decreased summer precipitation (11550-11520 cal BP). About 11520 cal BP, a very brief period of wetter conditions occurred, simultaneously with the beginning of the major warming. However, most of the first phase of the major warming (11520-11500 cal BP) was characterised by a generally dry climate, presumably due to lowered winter precipitation. Our records suggest that in this phase the warming concerned winter seasons mostly. In the second phase (11500-11460 cal BP) the warming also concerned summer seasons. Also, a distinct increase of humidity is noted in this period, which caused moistening of soils and, despite enhanced evaporation and evapotranspiration, inhibited the process of lake-level drop. The following 70 years (11460-11390 cal BP) were rather dry, which caused a distinct lowering of the lake (and probably also of groundwater) level. In this period, maximum biological productivity (per unit area) in the lake is noted. The whole sequence of phases of rather different climates was completed within a time interval (160 years) spanning two human lifes only. One should stress that the transitions between the consecutive phases were rather abrupt, lasting no longer than 10 years. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Riley			Unique reproductive characteristics of Lake Tahoe's Capnia lacustra (Plecoptera:Capniidae), a stonefly in decline	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Capnia lacustra Jewett 1965, a wingless stonefly found in the deep benthic environment of Lake Tahoe, has declined in density and distribution since the 1960s. We investigated its life-history characteristics, including its pattern of voltinism. We also compared C. lacustra's current density and distribution in plant beds to that in the 1960s. Size-frequency analysis showed the development of 2 asynchronous reproductive cohorts, each with a life-cycle duration of approximate to 1 y. The presence of eggs within mature females in May and November confirmed that spring and autumn cohorts develop simultaneously. We found eggs throughout the abdomen, thorax, and head of C. lacustra females. Females from the autumn cohort were viviparous, whereas the spring cohort was oviparous. This is the first time facultative viviparity has been described for Plecoptera. Capnia lacustra's unique life history probably is driven by relatively stable temperatures and food availability in Chara beds in the lake. Capnia lacustra currently is known to occur only in 3 areas of Lake Tahoe, whereas it was widespread in the 1960s. It has maintained high densities at 1 of the sites, Camp Richardson, which has an extensive and dense bed of the macroalga Chara. Capnia lacustra's dependence on Chara, which is declining in geographic and depth distribution in the lake, may have led to the observed declines in density and distribution of this remarkable stonefly.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				DEC	2016	35	4					1291	1299		10.1086/688485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/688485													WOS:000388080700019

The strong influence of salinity on the phytoplankton communities in both study periods appears to result principally from the influence of the sea, resulting from the intrusion of salt water during certain periods of the year. The predominant chemical characteristic in summer indicates a slight reduction in water quality, due to a rise in temperature and a reduction in the oxygen concentration.

Late Quaternary vegetation and lake system dynamics in north-eastern Siberia: Implications for seasonal climate variability	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					2nd International Conference of the Palaeo-Arctic-Spatial-and-Temporal-Gateways-Network (PAST Gateways)	2014	Trieste, ITALY	Palaeo Arctic Spatial & Temporal Gateways Network				Although the climate development over the Holocene in the Northern Hemisphere is well known, palaeolimnological climate reconstructions reveal spatiotemporal variability in northern Eurasia. Here we present a multi-proxy study from north-eastern Siberia combining sediment geochemistry, and diatom and pollen data from lake-sediment cores covering the last 38,000 cal. years. Our results show major changes in pyrite content and fragilarioid diatom species distributions, indicating prolonged seasonal lake-ice cover between similar to 13,500 and similar to 8900 cal. years BP and possibly during the 8200 cal. years BP cold event. A pollen-based climate reconstruction generated a mean July temperature of 17.8 degrees C during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) between similar to 8900 and similar to 4500 cal. years BP. Naviculoid diatoms appear in the late Holocene indicating a shortening of the seasonal ice cover that continues today. Our results reveal a strong correlation between the applied terrestrial and aquatic indicators and natural seasonal climate dynamics in the Holocene. Planktonic diatoms show a strong response to changes in the lake ecosystem due to recent climate warming in the Anthropocene. We assess other palaeolimnological studies to infer the spatiotemporal pattern of the HTM and affirm that the timing of its onset, a difference of up to 3000 years from north to south, can be well explained by climatic teleconnections. The westerlies brought cold air to this part of Siberia until the Laurentide ice sheet vanished 7000 years ago. The apparent delayed ending of the HTM in the central Siberian record can be ascribed to the exceedance of ecological thresholds trailing behind increases in winter temperatures and decreases in contrast in insolation between seasons during the mid to late Holocene as well as lacking differentiation between summer and winter trends in paleolimnological reconstructions.

Spatial and temporal distributions of Dreissena spp. veligers in Lake Huron: Does calcium limit settling success?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The larval stage of invasive Dreissena spp. mussels (i.e., veligers) are understudied despite their seasonal numerical dominance among plankton. We report the spring and summer veliger densities and size structure across the main basin, North Channel, and Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, and seek to explain spatiotemporal variation. Monthly sampling was conducted at 9 transects and up to 3 sites per transect from spring through summer 2017. Veliger densities peaked in June and July, and we found comparable densities and biomasses of veligers between basins, despite differences in density of juvenile and adult mussels across these regions. Using a generalized additive model to explain variations in veliger density, we found that temperature, chlorophyll a, and nitrates/nitrites were most important. We generated an index of veliger attrition based on size distributions that revealed a higher rate of attrition in the North Channel than the rest of the lake. A logistic model indicated a threshold calcium concentration of around 22 mg/L was necessary for veligers to survive to larger sizes and recruit to their juvenile and benthic adult life stages. Improved understanding of factors that regulate the production and survival of Dreissena veligers could improve the ability of managers to assess future invasion threats as well as explore potential control options.

J	Cheng, L; Lek, S; Lek-Ang, S; Li, ZJ				Cheng, Lin; Lek, Sovan; Lek-Ang, Sithan; Li, Zhongjie			Predicting fish assemblages and diversity in shallow lakes in the Yangtze River basin	LIMNOLOGICA												Habitat modifications induced by humans severely impact biotic components of freshwater ecosystems. In China, shallow lakes in the Yangtze River basin are facing severe habitat degradation induced by pollution, habitat losing, macrophytes disappearing and fishery activities. Effectively modeling the fish communities on the basis of biotic and abiotic environmental descriptors would be helpful to understand the relationships between fish and their environment, and to develop suitable conservation strategies to sustain the biodiversity in these ecosystems. From 2007 to 2009, investigations were carried out on fish and their environment in 6 lakes distributed in the mid-reach of the Yangtze River basin. According to the CPUE values of each fish species from each sampling, 117 datasets were ordinated using self-organizing map (SOM). Fish communities were classified into three clusters of species assemblages, spatial and temporal distributions were showing in it. Seasonal changes in fish community were more obvious in vegetated habitats than in unvegetated areas. The total CPUE, fish diversity and species richness were significantly different among the assemblages (p < 0.01). Based on the indicative value of each species in each cluster calculated by Indval method, 16 species were identified as indicators: 13 indicators in cluster G1 are pelagic or benthopelagic fish, the only one indicator species in G2 is a tolerant species (Culter dabry B.), while the other two indicator species in G3 are demersal fish (Rhinogobius giurinus R. and Odontobutis obscurus T. & G.). These results are in agreement with the contributions of different ecological groups of fish in each assemblage in the trained SOM, pelagic and benthopelagic fish were found having more activities in spring and winter, while more activities of demersal fish were found in summer and autumn. Fish community assemblages, the total fish CPUE, diversity and species richness in those lakes were then predicted by 15 abiotic and biotic factors using random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART) predictive models. The predicted assignment of each site unit to the correct assemblage had an average success of 74.4% and 60.7% in RF and CART models, respectively. The dominant variables for discriminating three fish assemblages were water depth, distance to the bank and total phosphorus. While the two important variables in prediction fish CPUE, diversity and species richness were lake surface area and water depth, density of rotifer and water depth, water depth and water temperature, respectively. The overall percentages of successful prediction varied from 56.5% to 67% utilizing leave-one-out for cross-validation tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The seasonal and vertical distribution of the abundance of virus-like particles (VLPs), together with the abundances of other microbial organisms (bacteria, unpigmented and pigmented nanoflagellates and ciliates), were determined in an oligomesotrophic lake (Pavin, France) and in a eutrophic lake (Aydat, France) between March and December 2000. 2. The abundance of the viral plankton and those of other microbial taxa were significantly higher in the more productive system. The same was for the virus-to-bacteria quotient (VBQ), which averaged seven in Lake Pavin and nine in Lake Aydat. 3. The abundance of viruses increased during the period of thermal stratification in both lakes, with the highest values being recorded at the end of summer/early autumn in the epi- and the metalimnion. The seasonal pattern of abundance of viruses in both lakes in the surface layer was similar, indicating that the dynamics of viruses may be controlled by environmental factors such as light conditions. 4. There was no correlation between the abundance of viruses and protists. We found correlations between viruses and heterotrophic bacteria in the whole water column in Lake Pavin, but only in the dark bottom waters in Lake Aydat. 5. Overall, the empirical findings in this study lead us to speculate that the weaker correlation between bacteria and viruses in Lake Aydat than in Lake Pavin, as well as the higher VBQ in the former, is a consequence of the increasing relative abundance of non-bacteriophage VLPs along the trophic gradient of aquatic systems.					; Bettarel, Yvan/L-2691-2017; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Carrias, Jean-François/AAT-2738-2021	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2003	48	5					810	822		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01064.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01064.x													WOS:000182183600005

Winter application of manure on an agricultural watershed and its impact on downstream nutrient fluxes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Whole Farm Planning was instituted and monitored over a 5-year period within the Graywood Gully sub-watershed of Conesus Lake, NY (USA). An array Of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) (strip cropping, fertilizer reduction, tiling, Manure disposal practices, etc.) were simultaneously introduced to determine the impact of a concentrated management effort on nutrient and soil loss from one water shed within the Conesus Lake catchment. During the study period, significant decreases in winter concentrations of dissolved and particulate fractions, including total phosphorus (TP), Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and nitrate (NO3) but not total suspended solids (TSS), were observed. These decreases may or may not be attributed to cessation of manuring practices. Three years into the study, an opportunity existed to test the responsiveness of the watershed to the Curtailment of a single BMP - winter manure application to fields. We field-tested the hypothesis that a change ill winter Manure applications would impact dissolved and particulate fractions in stream water draining this watershed. We found that the water quality of Graywood Gully is very responsive to winter manure application oil environmentally sensitive portions of the sub-watershed. With the short-term resumption of manure application, TP, SRP, TKN, and NO3 concentrations rose dramatically in stream water; elevated phosphorus concentrations persisted over a 5-week period. Total suspended solids, however, were not elevated after short-term manure application. Factors that affected these results were slope of the land, application of manure over snow and during a snowfall, warm air and soil temperatures, and possibly the drainage of snowmelt water. Managers of agricultural systems must recognize that phosphorus losses from the watershed during the nongrowing season may detrimentally affect nuisance Population of algae in lakes during the summer.

Phytoplankton community during the survey period was characterized by over-whelming dominance by a diatom (Melosira (syn. Aulacoseira) granulata (EHRENB.) RALFS), which was presumably brought about by exceptionally windy weather in this year. Diatom population density and concentrations of biogenic silica and chlorophyll-a were higher in the more eutrophied stations. It seemed unlikely that the diatom population growth was limited by the supply of silicate, except in a short period in October at the station of median nutritional status. Rather, an observation that diatoms tended to decrease in August when dissolved inorganic nitrogen was commonly depleted suggested the diatom population size to have been determined principally by the nitrogen availability. A comparison of relative turnover periods among soluble inorganic N, P and Si supported further that the growth of phytoplankton as a whole was limited by nitrogen supply during August and the first half of September, and by phosphorus supply in the other period. Some potential factors are discussed which would determine the availability of nutrients during the successional passage from summer to autumn in this basin.

J	Jyväsjärvi, J; Hämäläinen, H				Jyvasjarvi, Jussi; Hamalainen, Heikki			Profundal benthic invertebrate communities in boreal lakes vary with climate fluctuation	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Despite increasing evidence that climate change affects aquatic ecosystems, influences on lake benthic communities are still poorly known. We studied the effects of short-term climatic fluctuation on profundal benthic invertebrates using at least six annual samples (over 6-17 years) from 38 Finnish lake basins. Faunal abundance, species diversity and species composition were related to annual winter and summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices as measures of climatic fluctuation. Algal productivity, hypolimnetic oxygen concentration and water temperature weakly increased during the positive NAO periods. Profundal macroinvertebrate abundance and species diversity declined with increasing NAO in summer, but not winter. The main gradient of species compositional overturn (DCA axis 1) was negatively associated with lake productivity and varied independent of NAO, whereas the secondary gradient (DCA axis 2) correlated positively with hypolimnetic temperature and winter NAO. The responses of species diversity and abundance to climatic fluctuation were not related to any measured lake-specific environmental characteristics, but the response of species composition (DCA axis 1) to NAO showed a consistent negative association with lake depth and trophic status, so that size and even direction of compositional response to NAO was related to these two lake characteristics. Our study suggests that local profundal benthic macroinvertebrate communities can respond rapidly to short-term, large-scale climate fluctuation and hence that future global warming can be expected to modify these sensitive communities considerably.

J	Bueche, T; Vetter, M				Bueche, Thomas; Vetter, Mark			Future alterations of thermal characteristics in a medium-sized lake simulated by coupling a regional climate model with a lake model	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Regional climate models (RCM) provide site-specific meteorological data at a suitable spatial resolution for the estimation of future climate-driven changes in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we used meteorological data from the RCM weather-situation-based regionalization method (WETTREG), available for Germany, to force a one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model to simulate climate-induced changes on the summer thermal stratification of Lake Ammersee in southern Germany. In comparison to the period of 2002-2010, an extension by 22 days of the summer stratification period was simulated for 2042-2050. Further, a vertical shift in the position of metalimnion and thermocline within the lake was not detected, but a slight increase in the metalimnion thickness during mid-summer of 1 m was simulated. Along with these changes in stratification patterns, warming for the epilimnion water temperatures during summer stratification and for the entire water body in winter were simulated for the future. By contrast the hypolimnion temperatures are simulated to decrease during the summer stratification. In addition to simulating future limno-physical aspects, the investigation demonstrates that the RCM data of the WETTREG projection are suitable for conducting climate change impact studies.

J	MALM, J; JONSSON, L				MALM, J; JONSSON, L			A STUDY OF THE THERMAL BAR IN LAKE LADOGA USING WATER-SURFACE TEMPERATURE DATA FROM SATELLITE IMAGES	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												During spring and autumn a special thermohydrodynamic phenomenon, called a thermal bar, can be observed in dimictic lakes. [A dimictic lake is a lake where a complete turnover of the water occurs twice a year (in spring and autumn).] The thermal bar is a zone of mixing that separates waters with temperatures above and below 4-degrees-C. Its practical importance is due to the possibility that it might isolate the nearshore region from the offshore region (as seen from the thermal bar), which may cause a serious pollution problem along the beach. This article presents a study of the thermal bar and its temporal behavior in Lake Ladoga, Russia, using NOAA-AVHRR CH4/CH5 data. As the thermal bar is associated with a rather characteristic temperature pattern, that is, relatively large temperature changes from the shore to the bar and weak gradients beyond implying almost isothermal conditions, satellite data can provide a good means of detecting the existence of a thermal bar. The satellite-derived water surface temperature distributions, calibrated with some in situ temperature data, show that the thermal bar progresses from the shallow southern region to the deep northern part of the lake. The thermal bar progression during spring, obtained from sequences of satellite images, is also compared with predictions from a simple theoretical model. The model assumes that the heat entering through the surface of a water column remains within the column (i.e., horizontal heat fluxes are neglected) and that complete vertical mixing takes place by convective water movements. The comparison shows a good agreement between satellite-derived an model-predicted thermal bar locations (although there are uncertainties as to certain inputs to the model). This indicates that advective and diffusive horizontal heat fluxes are not of primary importance for the thermal bar displacement and that the model is a good first approximation for predictions of the thermal bar location.

Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology, the community structure composition of prokaryotic ultraplankton and its relationship with environmental factors were analyzed. The results showed that Cihu Lake was experiencing eutrophication and that Xiandao Lake was in the process of changing from mesotrophic to oligotrophic conditions. Cihu Lake and Xiandao Lake were regulated primarily by nitrogen nutrients. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteriota were the major phyla of prokaryotic ultraplankton in both lakes. Among them, Cyanobacteria dominate in the summer in Cihu Lake, which can have seasonal cyanobacterial blooms. Seasonal variation significantly affects the diversity and community structure of prokaryotic ultraplankton in the lakes, with temperature and dissolved oxygen being the key environmental factors determining plankton community composition. The PICRUSt functional prediction analysis indicated a higher water purification and exogenous pollution remediation capacity of the microbial communities of Xiandao Lake, as well as in the spring samples of Cihu Lake. In this study, the diversity and spatial-temporal succession patterns of prokaryotic ultraplankton in Cihu Lake and Xiandao Lake were elucidated, providing a useful reference for the lake environmental protection and water eutrophication management in Cihu Lake and Xiandao Lake.					; tingting, li/AAP-6698-2020; Wu, Xiaodong/ITT-3925-2023	Hou, Jianjun/0000-0001-8117-8668; Wu, Xiaodong/0000-0002-7218-4123														2071-1050				AUG	2023	15	15							11532	10.3390/su151511532	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151511532													WOS:001045746100001

One of characteristic of this zone is dry climate in summer when temperature reach 45 degrees C and decrease in winter 5 degrees C. Chott Baghdad irrigate with surface water zone, continental saharan aquifer and precipitated water. Evaporative lakes without river outlets are common and their chemical composition has been reported to exhibit a wide diversity (Hardie and Eugster, 1970; Eugster and Hardie, 1978). Geologies and gitologic characteristics of deposed evaporates in Baghdad basin, small closed lagon take place with brines rich in ions SO42-, Ca2+, Na+, Cl- and under the effect of evaporation generate the rock salt and gypsum precipitation. The objective of this study is to simulate evolution the geochemical cycle inside of chott Baghdad, in addition try to interpreter behavior of major element which constructs this small depression. The most important thing is to calculate saturated index of evaporated mineral and compare it with DRX result. To reach this study, monthly brine samples were collected from January to December. Different analytic methods were used: physico-chemical analytic (PH, temperature and conductivity). In addition, spectrophotometer and titration, phlameemissions were done to calculate major element concentration. From this study, we can conclude that major element behavior (Na+, Cl-, SO42-, Mg+, K+, HCO3-, and Ca2+) potassium and magnesium have characteristic evolution, where they increase at the beginning of geochemical cycle till summer then decrease steadily at the end of cycle. Where us, Calcium is quit steady during one year cycle.																			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1675-8				2018	1968								020006	10.1063/1.5039166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5039166													WOS:000435275200006

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Desert lakes are unique ecosystems found in oases within desert landscapes. Despite the numerous studies on oases, there are no reports regarding the spatiotemporal distribution and causes of eutrophication in the desert lakes that are located at the edge of the Linze Oasis in northwestern China. In this study, the seasonal shoreline and eutrophication of a desert lake were monitored using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and water sampling during three crop growth stages. The spatial extents of the shoreline and algal blooms and the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient were derived through UAV images. The desert lake shoreline declined during the crop growing stage, which exhibited the largest water demand and began to expand after this stage. The estimated CDOM absorption coefficient measurements and classified algal bloom area showed seasonal variations that increased from spring to late summer and then decreased in autumn. The first two crop growth stages accounted for most of the water and fertilizer requirements of the entire growth period, which may have contributed to large amounts of groundwater consumption and pollution and resulted in peak eutrophication of the lake in the second growth stage. However, the CDOM absorption coefficient of the third stage was not well correlated with that of the first two stages, suggesting that the lake may be affected by the dual effects of groundwater and precipitation recharge in the third stage. These results indicate that the water quality of desert lakes may be affected by agricultural cultivation. The agricultural demands for water and fertilizer may change the spatiotemporal changes in water quality in the lake, especially in the middle and early stages of crop growth.					; Wang, Lixin/A-2572-2008; Luo, Lihui/Z-2033-2019; Duan, Quntao/GQG-9688-2022; Ogashawara, Igor/Q-5013-2018	Luo, Lihui/0000-0002-9471-7373; Wang, Lixin/0000-0003-0968-1247; Ogashawara, Igor/0000-0001-6328-0001; Duan, Quntao/0000-0001-7907-6064; Zhou, Chenglin/0000-0003-1486-4371													0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN 7	2021	193	1							43	10.1007/s10661-020-08806-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08806-0								33410991					WOS:000608021600001

Investigation of first year biotic and abiotic influences on the recruitment of pike Esox lucius over 48 years in Windermere, UK	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Estimated pike Esox lucius recruitment varied by a factor of 16 for females from 1944 to 1991 and by a factor of 27 for males from 1943 to 1990 in Windermere, a temperate, mesotrophic U. K. lake. No significant stock-recruitment relationships were found, but analysis with general additive models (GAMs) revealed that early autumnal water temperature, strength and direction of the North Atlantic Oscillation displacement (corresponding to different climatic conditions in winter) and zooplankton abundance but above all, late summer water temperature were important explanatory variables over the entire time series. Female recruitment was also influenced by young-of-the-year winter temperature. There was no evidence that perch Perca fluviatilis year-class strength, lake level or the summer position of the Gulf Stream influenced recruitment. The fitted models explained up to c. 65% of the overall observed variation between years.

Effects of light on sediment nutrient flux and water column nutrient stoichiometry in a shallow lake	WATER RESEARCH												The effects of light and temperature on nutrient cycling (silica (Si), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) between sediments and water in a shallow eutrophic lake (Loch Leven, Scotland), and consequent effects on water column nutrient stoichiometry, were assessed using a series of intact sediment core incubation experiments. Estimates of actual seasonal dark and light P-fluxes were assessed using 24-h incubations. Sediment-P uptake was observed in spring (7 degrees C) and release in autumn (12 degrees C) and summer (17,C), with the highest release rates (similar to 17MgPO(4)-Pm-2 sediment surface area d(-1)) occurring in summer. In a longer (21-day) experiment in which the effects of light (light (n = 6) and dark (n = 6)) and temperature (five 4-day cycles to represent: 7 degrees C double right arrow 13 degrees C double right arrow 23 degrees C double right arrow 13 degrees C double right arrow 7 degrees C) on water column nutrient concentrations were assessed, PO4--P, total P (TP), SiO2 and total silica (TSi) concentrations in the water column were all significantly higher under dark conditions (ANOVA, alpha = 0.05). NH4-N (ammonium N) water column concentrations were observed to be higher under dark conditions at low temperatures and higher under light conditions following a high-temperature (23 degrees C) treatment. No significant light effects were observed for water column total N (TN) concentration. Flux estimates for all nutrients measured are given. In terms of water column nutrient stoichiometry, TN:TP ratio was significantly higher under light conditions, TSi:TN was significantly lower under light conditions, and TSi:TP did not vary significantly between the dark and light treatments. The main processes acting to regulate diffusive nutrient release appeared to be photosynthetic elevation of bottom water pH and dissolved oxygen concentration (both significantly higher under light conditions) and direct microalgal sequestration. Thus, a feedback mechanism exists in recovering shallow lakes where benthic microalgae can affect the stoichiometry (to favour P/Si limitation) of the plankton, and also of the main source of nutrients back to the sediments via the disproportionate regulation of sediment P, Si and N release.

We present lake sediment core data from Fallen Leaf Lake, a subalpine system at the southern end of the Lake Tahoe basin for which 80% of the contemporary inflow is derived from snowpack delivered by Pacific frontal storm systems. A high quality age model has been constructed using C-14 ages on plant macrofossils, Pb-210, and the Tsoyowata tephra datum (7.74-7.95 cal kyr BP). One core captures the transition from the Late Tioga-younger Dryas glaciolacustrine package to laminated opaline clay at 11.48 cal kyr BR Early Holocene sedimentation rates are relatively high (similar to 1.9 mm/year) and cooler winter temperatures are inferred by the presence of pebbles interpreted to be transported out into the lake via shore ice. There is a geochemically distinct interval from similar to 4.71 to 3.65 cal kyr BP that is interpreted as a late Holocene neopluvial, characterized by depleted delta C-13 and lower C:N that point to reduced runoff of terrigenous organic matter, increased winter precipitation, and increased algal productivity. The largest Holocene signal in the cores occurs at the end of the neopluvial, at 3.65 cal kyr BP, and marks a shift into a climate state with variable precipitation, yet is overall more arid than the neopluvial. This new climate state persists for similar to 3 ka, until the Little Ice Age. Low sedimentation rates (0.5 mm/year), the homogeneous opaline sediment, and steadily increasing contributions of terrestrial vs. algal organic matter in these cores suggest that the lowstand state of Fallen Leaf Lake may have been the norm from 3.65 to 0.55 cal kyr BP, punctuated by short term high precipitation years or multi-year intervals capable of rapid short duration lake level rise. Fallen Leaf Lake is strongly influenced by changes in winter precipitation and temperature, manifested largely by the geochemical proxies, and highlights unique advantages of subalpine lakes in regional paleoclimate reconstructions.

J	Yamamoto, Y; Shiah, FK				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo			Appearance of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in winter in an artificial pond in northern Taiwan	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The seasonal dynamics of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was investigated from June 2011 to December 2013 in a small artificial pond in northern Taiwan. The abundance of C. raciborskii increased from late February to early April 2012 when the water temperature ranged from 16.4 to 21.7 degrees C and from mid-August 2012 to mid-February 2013 as the water temperature decreased from about 27 degrees C to below 20 degrees C; it peaked in mid-February 2013 when the water temperature was 16.3 degrees C. In the summer months, the abundance of C. raciborskii was very low and sometimes undetectable. A laboratory experiment using a strain that was isolated from the pond suggested that the dominance of C. raciborskii in low-temperature seasons could be attributed to its tolerance of, not preference for, low temperatures. Contrary to the results of this study, our earlier survey conducted in the same pond from August 2009 to January 2011 showed that the abundance of C. raciborskii was low in winter and increased in summer. Environmental changes in the study pond and/or the appearance of a different ecotype was assumed to be responsible for the change in the dynamics of C. raciborskii.

Seasonal variations in the occurrence and fate of basic and neutral pharmaceuticals in a Swedish river-lake system	CHEMOSPHERE												The seasonal variations in the occurrence of carbamazepine, atenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, and acebutolol were studied at seven sites along River Fyris from December 2007 to December 2008. Samples were collected from the effluent of a waste water treatment plant (WWTP), at one upstream site, and five downstream sites of the WWTP). During one occasion in May 2008, water samples were collected at different locations and depths in the recipient lake. All analytes except of acebutolol were present in both the river and the lake at quantifiable amounts at all sampling occasions. Carbamazepine was found in similar concentrations (about 90 ng L(-1)) at all sampling sites and all studied depths (0.5-40 m) in the lake, indicating high environmental persistence of this compound. A clear seasonal pattern was observed for the natural attenuation of the beta-blockers in the river, with the highest attenuation occurring in summer and the lowest in winter. The loss of beta-blockers on a distance of 1320 m reached up to 75% during summer time but was insignificant during winter. The seasonal variations in the loss followed the seasonal variations in water temperature and chlorophyll a mass flow suggesting that biotransformation and adsorption are the main processes responsible for the loss of the studied pharmaceuticals in River Fyris downstream the WWTP.

Variability of the Morphological Parameters of Trapa natans (Trapaceae, Magnoliópsida) during Reintroduction into Reservoirs of Saratov Oblast from Reservoirs of Voronezh Oblast	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The fruits of Trapa natans L. s.l. (Trapaceae) (disappeared from the territory of Saratov oblast), collected in floodplain lakes of the Khoper River at the territory of Voronezh oblast (Novokhoporskii district), were sown in autumn 2019 and spring 2020 into the Khoper and Volga rivers on the territory of Saratov oblast. In autumn 2020, germinated rosettes of water caltrop were noted in 17 sowing places; moreover, there were fewer germinated rosettes than the number of fruits sown in most of these places. Only in three artificial plantings was the number of rosettes equal to or more than the number of fruits sown. According to morphometric parameters of the vegetative sphere, five artificial plantings (nos. 6, 7, 9, 15, 21) from the Khoper River are close to the donor populations; by potential and real seed productivity, only two artificial plantings (nos. 7 and 9) from the Khoper River. Reintroduction of T. natans is more promising in the Khoper River, while reintroduction is complicated in the Volga River (at least in the seeding region) due to sharp changes in the water level during the season.					; Parhomenko, Alena/V-9523-2019; Bogoslov, Artem/AAR-3846-2021; Denisov, Anton/MVW-2430-2025; Kashin, Alexandr Stepanovich/D-9809-2013; Alexandr, Kashin/D-9809-2013	Parkhomenko, Alena/0000-0002-9948-7298; Shilova, Irina/0000-0002-9828-4229; Bogoslov, Artem/0000-0002-2248-1285; Kashin, Alexandr Stepanovich/0000-0002-2342-2172; Kondrateva, Anna/0000-0001-5000-8914; 													1062-3590	1608-3059				DEC	2022	49	10					1909	1922		10.1134/S1062359022100296	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359022100296													WOS:000937072100025

A lot of fish species grow in this lake and many birds and ducks live and nest in this area. A total of 12 sets of surface water samples were collected from three representative points from Braeni Lake, during 2015 and 2016 for three seasons (autumn, winter and spring). The samples were taken bi-monthly. In situ, using a portable multiparameter WTW Multi 350i, were determined the physico-chemical parameters like: pH, EC, TDS, ORP, and salinity. In laboratory by using an ion chromatograph (IC500 Dionex) were analysed the following cations: NH4+, Mg-2(+), Ca-2(+), Li+, Na+, K+ and anions F- Cr-, NO2-, Br-, NO3-, PO43-, SO42-. The content of heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Fe) was analysed using an atomic absorption spectrometer (ZEEnit 700 Analytik Jena). The cations concentration varied between: 56.31 - 75.97 mg/L for Na+, 20.44 - 26.66 mg/L for K+, 35.92 - 54.80 mg/L for Mg2+, 67.83 - 144.22 mg/L for Ca2+. N-NH4+ was found only in one sample (0.3 mg/L) and Li+ was found in three samples (0.25 - 0.26 mg/L). The anions concentration varied between: 26.78 - 48.93 mg/L (Cl-), 0.20 - 0.51 mg/L (F), 0.19 - 4.07 mg/L (N-NO3-), 124.77 - 193.51 mg/L (SO42-). Lead ranged between 3.98 and 33.01 mu g/L and iron had levels between 0.02 and 0.6 mg/L. Using the obtained results, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and Kelley's index (KI) were calculated, in order to determine if the water is suitable for irrigation.

More than 91% of cackling geese foraged in barley stubble when there were relatively few (14.9%) immatures in the population (1985). In 1986 and 1987, when there were relatively large proportions of immatures (35.9% and 26.1%, respectively), cackling geese foraged predominately in alfalfa or winter wheat (96.8% of both age classes in 1986 and 61.6% of adults and 87.2% of immatures in 1987). In November 1987, irrigation flooded about 1,000 acres of potatoes and barley which attracted about 10,000 of the +/- 40,000 cackling geese that had been feeding in one alfalfa field. Proportionally more adults than immatures moved to the flooded barley. Alfalfa leaves and sprouting winter wheat contain about 1.9 to 2.5 times more crude protein than barley seeds, whereas barley contains about 2.2 times more carbohydrates than green forage. Immature cackling geese were in protein demanding events of growth and molt. Large numbers of immatures in the population may increase use of green forage. A poor production year may result in most geese using barley because energy requirements can be obtained in about 25% of the time required when grazing. Ample green forage for cackling geese should be provided even if the geese do not use such foods in some years.																			0008-1078					WIN	1991	77	1					1	9																WOS:A1991FV64700001

Water level fluctuations in these ecosystems can have a decisive role in community structuring and functioning and may affect their conservation values. The results obtained enable an assessment of the consequences of water quality changes resulting from the increased evaporation, drastic fluctuations in water levels and higher incidence of droughts in summer. Desiccation was observed to cause an increase in the bicarbonate and chloride concentrations, whilst sulphate content was frequently found to have decreased. With respect to nutrients, a drastic reduction in water volume increased orthophosphate levels, with a consequent drop in the N-nitrate: SRP ratio. Pond refilling following total desiccation resulted in higher total anion content, especially among the waters with higher mineral content, the extent of which was related to the rate of refilling. When refill followed desiccation, sulphate concentrations increased the most, whilst alkalinity decreased in most ponds. An increase in chloride concentration was only observed when refilling occurred slowly. Orthophosphate and nitrate concentrations increased at the start of the refilling period, although the most pronounced increase was in nitrate which, together with potassium, was probably washed into the ponds through soil leaching following autumn rainfall.

Floodplain carbon dioxide emissions strongly exceed those of the main river stem: A case study of the Ob River, western Siberia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The importance of floodplains in carbon (C) evasion from the lotic systems is especially important in continental plains of low runoff such as the organic-rich Western Siberian Lowland (WSL). To quantify the relative importance of the floodplain compared to main stem CO2 emissions, we monitored a large region of the Ob River's middle course (permafrost-free zone) over 3 months from spring to summer. We calculated seasonal water coverage using remote sensing, GIS and hydrologically-based approaches and measured CO2 emissions using floating chambers. There was a strongly pronounced seasonality in the water area's extent of the floodplain with water covering > 40 % of land during the similar to 30 days of the most intensive spring flood (May - June) and subsequently declining to <= 10 % during summer (July-August). Maximal CO2 emissions were recorded in most shallow water bodies of the floodplain, notably in temporary flooded fens and birch forests. The CO2 emissions during the study period ranged from 0.2 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.2 g Cm-2 d(-1) for the floodplain and 0.03 +/- 0.34 g C m(-2) d(-1) for the Ob's main channel.CO2 emissions from the floodplain were similar to 163 +/- 20 t C per km for the river's main stem during the 95 day study period. The partial contributions of temporary flooded zones, main stem, and permanent lakes / secondary channels to total emissions (1820 km(2) area) were 70, 16, and 14 %, respectively. Over spring and summer seasons, contributions from flooded zones ranged from 43 to 99 % of total CO2 emissions from water surfaces of the Ob River's middle course. Extrapolation of obtained results to the entire territory of the Ob River floodplain indicates that not accounting for the floodplain emissions may sizably-up to an order of magnitude-underestimate the CO2 emissions from riverine systems in Western Siberia during open water period. Future work on the Ob River floodplain in the permafrost-bearing zone should be prioritized and would allow adequate upscaling of C emission from this environmentally important territory.

Dependent on the growth conditions of reed, periphyton reached its maximum biomass either in winter or spring (max. 50 g ashfree dry weight/m2 substratum). An incubator was constructed for periphytic production measurements (oxygen method) in the field. Periphytic production was relatively high for a short period in spring (0.6 g C/m2 littoral zone .cntdot. day-1). The initial slope of the P vs. I-curve (.alpha.'') was highly dependent on the density of the incubated periphytic biomass per unit substratum. The yearly primary production was estimated to be 67 g C/m2 of littoral zone and 558 kg C per total lake surface of the littoral zone. Annual epiphytic production on reed in this lake is less than 1 percent of total annual phytoplankton production.																			0003-9136					MAR	1988	112	1					21	42																WOS:A1988M984300002

Due to limitations in high costs in situ monitoring, current remote sensing of lakes often relies on models trained with water quality samples from a single season. However, the generalization ability of these single-season trained models to other seasons has not been extensively studied. In this study, focusing on 38 major lakes in the Yangtze River Basin, we utilized monthly chlorophyll-a (Chla) monitoring data and Sentinel-2 image datasets from 2016 to 2021 to assess the impact of different seasonal data-trained models on the performance of Chla concentration retrieval in lakes. The results indicate that: (a) The sampling time for lake Chla significantly affects the performance of the retrieval model. Based on the seasonal data, the trained models show an R2 range of 0.523 to 0.699, with a Bias ranging from -7.06 % to 7.74 %, while the models trained with full-season samples perform between the various seasonal models. (b) When models built with seasonal data are applied to full-season data retrieval, there is a noticeable decrease in performance. The R2 of the spring-winter data trained model drops by 18.2 %, with RMSL and MAPE increasing by 11.4 % and 4.2 %, respectively. Similarly, the model trained from summer-autumn data shows a 4.02 % decrease in R2, with RMSLE and MAPE rising by 2.76 % and 13.56 %, respectively. This suggests that using models established from seasonal samples to infer full-season Chla concentrations can amplify errors. (c) Compared to seasonal models, full-season models based on different seasonal sampling exhibit better performance (R2 = 0.585, RMSLE = 0.337, Bias = -3.12 %, MAPE = 34.71 %). R2, RMSLE, and MAPE are all superior to seasonal models. Therefore, when performing full-time and long-term retrieval of Chla concentrations in water bodies, it is necessary to use data sampled in different seasons to reduce the errors introduced by seasonal sampling. (d) Chla retrieval models were established for 38 typical lakes and reservoirs in the Yangtze River Basin using the full-time dataset, revealing that 25 % (7/28) of the lakes and 20 % (2/10) of the reservoirs showed significant alteration trends. The number of lakes with increasing Chla concentrations exceeded those with decreasing concentrations, indicating that there is still a substantial risk of eutrophication in the lakes and reservoirs of the Yangtze River Basin.					hou, xikang/ABF-9017-2021; Yang, Yufeng/ABS-0346-2022; Guo, Fen/N-5321-2016	Gao, Wei/0000-0002-6260-0592													1470-160X	1872-7034				JAN	2024	158								111290	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111290		NOV 2023											WOS:001125946000001

Statistical analysis with experiment data shows that (1) there is good correlation between CODMn and chlorophyll-a concentration;(2)in summer, north Taihu Lake, the reflectivity spectra of light on water is affected mainly by chlorophyll-a concentration, which can be expressed by a liner correlation model and it is most obvious at wavelengths larger than 700 nm; (3) in winter, the reflectivity spectra of light on water is affected mainly by suspended substance concentration in a wide wavelengh range, which can be expressed by a log-liner correlation model or by a liner correlation model more suitably if only the suspended substance concentration less than 100 mg/L is considered, and it is more obvious at wavelengths between 500 nm similar to 800 nm. The statistical models about lake are made between the. surface spectral reflectivity at different wavelengths and the water quality parameters.																			1001-9014					DEC	2004	23	6					427	427																WOS:000225627400007

Depth profiles of DIC concentration and DIC delta(13)C showed a strong seasonal pattern, as a result of vertical mixing of the lake water in winter and early spring, or lack of mixing in the other seasons. No seasonal change in DIC Delta(14)C depth profiles was recognizable, mainly owing to the wide scatter of DIC Delta(14)C. Values typically ranged from 0.47 to 0.65 mmol kg(-1) for DIC concentration, and from -4 to -8 parts per thousand and from +10 to +80 parts per thousand for DIC delta(13)C and DIC Delta(14)C, respectively, for the Lake Biwa water.

Given this, the present study focused on quantifying these changes and correlating them to the spatial distribution and habitat affinity of the endemic cichlid fish Herichthys labridens, over 2 decades. Its spatial distribution was modeled and its suitable core habitat was estimated, considering their adult and juvenile life stages during 3 summer events (1999, 2009, and 2019). Based on occurrence records and the variables of water depth and underwater coverage, the variation in the spatial distribution of this fish species was evaluated in each summer event using the DOMAIN Model. A suitable core habitat was also identified from habitat resistance analysis. The highest probability of distribution (DP > 0.70) of both stages always occurred in areas with a high density of underwater vegetation, with a maximum depth of 1.5 m. On a spatial-temporal scale, the core habitat with medium and high suitability (HR <= 0.01) for adults and juveniles was to the extent that maintained its underwater coverage characteristics. This information is important for delimiting a conservation area of H. labridens in the Media Luna Spring.

Qualitative information on the composition of the colloidal phase was obtained from estimations of the colloidal Fraction of Al, Fe, Mn and organic carbon as well as by a sequential leaching procedure. The concentration of colloidal matter varied within a broad range (1.4-100 mg/l) in the stream, while the measurements in the lake indicated minor changes (range 0.8-3.3 mg/l) between the different sampling occasions as well as locations (both vertically and longitudinally). Annual variations in the size ranges of the colloids (spring 120-340 nm; summer 280-700 nm: winter 200-500 nm) were observed. The changes in the average diameters of the colloidal population showed no correlation with changes in any general hydrochemical parameters, but the estimates of the fraction of colloidal organic carbon (COG) indicated increased concentrations with increasing diameters.

J	Caine, N				Caine, N			Declining ice thickness on an alpine lake is generated by increased winter precipitation	CLIMATIC CHANGE												A 20-year record of ice thickness in late-March on an alpine lake in the Colorado Front Range shows a consistent thinning of the ice cover at 2.0 cm/yr (r = -0.931; N=16; p<0.01) during a period of increasing precipitation. The correlation between ice thickness and precipitation in the preceding Oct.-Mar. period is -0.439 (N=16; p<0.10), reflecting the insulating effect of an increase in snow cover on the lake. A second effect derived from increased precipitation occurs through additional water storage in the lake's catchment during the previous summer. This leads to a corresponding increase in groundwater flow to the lake during the winter, with a correlation between ice thickness and groundwater storage at the end of the preceding September of -0.656 (N=16; p<0.01). When combined, these two effects account for 50% of the variability in ice thickness (R=0.714; N=16; p<0.01). Thus, much of the decline in ice thickness in March is explained by two influences derived from an increase in winter precipitation: one associated with the current winter's precipitation and one with that of the previous winter.																			0165-0009					SEP	2002	54	4					463	470		10.1023/A:1016111810814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016111810814													WOS:000176781800006

American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) is one of the most widely used dispersion models for predicting air PM dispersion in coal mines. However, validation of AERMOD-predicted PM concentration in a large mine complex has not been reported. So, in this study, AERMOD predicted PM concentration was validated against the PM concentrations measured by nine continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) stationed in the Singrauli coal mining complex. The complex contains nine coal mines across 438 square kilometers, with around 129 pollution sources chiefly from the area, pit, and line categories. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations peak during summer (204.58 mu g/m(3)) and winter (67.67 mu g/m(3)), respectively. The AERMOD model predicts peak dispersion of PM10 (500-1200 mu g/m(3)) and PM2.5 (100-800 mu g/m(3)) during the winter season. The AERMOD model reveals that the region's wind movement caused by land and lake breezes was the predominant driver of PM surface dispersion. In the winter season, atmospheric inversion increases ground-level PM concentrations in the region. The AERMOD cannot represent the vertical dispersion of PMs in the summer, resulting in an underestimation of PM concentration. The statistical validation shows that AERMOD underestimates PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations across all seasons and years. The AERMOD model's prediction accuracy for PM10 (R-2 = 0.38) and PM2.5 (R-2 = 0.56) is also low. Finally, it can be concluded that AERMOD-predicted PM concentrations are not accurate for large mining complexes but more suitable for individual mines.

Before ice cover, algal concentration was low and uniformly distributed with depth, as it is in open Lake Michigan. During ice cover (February and March), a bloom of a typical winter-spring phytoplankton community developed in the upper 40 m, resulting in a 4 to 7-fold increase in feeding rate of adult Diaptomus spp. High algal concentration and zooplankton feeding persisted after ice melt (April). During and after ice cover, lipid concentrations of Diaptomus dropped rapidly from 34% of dry weight to 17% because of egg production. High incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), high (45-50%) PAR transmittance of the ice due to little snow on the ice, and water column stability were probably responsible for the bloom. High ice transparency may be a common feature of large lakes and bays, where strong winds blow snow cover off the ice, or at low latitudes where snowmelt due to occasional rains and warm temperature is common. Winter reproducing calanoid copepods use these blooms to increase their reproductive output.					; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020	Liebig, James/0000-0002-0433-9066; Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475; 													0018-8158					OCT 2	1992	243						175	183		10.1007/BF00007033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007033													WOS:A1992JZ96300019

The shallowness of the lake helped keep the water column homogeneous regarding bacterioplankton. Small free-living bacteria (0.03-mu-m3 cell-1) dominated the populations throughout the period studied. Bacterial abundances varied from 1 to 11 x 10(6) cells ml-1. Kinetic parameters (V(max), K + S and T) were determined with C-14 labelled compounds (glucose and amino acids mixture). V(max) values were high and averaged 0.056 and 0.050-mu-gC l-1 h-1 for glucose and amino acids respectively. Maximal V(max) values were observed in summer at the highest temperatures, but also in early spring. T values were much greater in winter. K + S values were significantly higher for amino acids (3-mu-g C l-1) than for glucose (1-mu-g C l-1). A low percentage of mineralization (about 25% for both tracers) could be the expression of the high growth efficiency expected when bacteria are growing at the expense of low molecular weight compounds as phytoplankton exudates.

Phosphate enhanced markedly total algal biomass and favoured the presence of cyanophytes, especially in the summer epilimnion, while cryptophytes dominated at this time during unfertilized periods. Anabaena sp. peaked during summer and a higher density of Ceratium hirundinella and Peridinium sp. in mid-summer was also observed during the fertilized period. Otherwise, algal composition and periodicity remained similar for the two comparative periods. In both, diatoms (Asterionella formosa and Aulacoseira italica) dominated during spring.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	370						133	137		10.1023/A:1017078716841	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017078716841													WOS:000076259900013

Despite this, hardly any studies exist examining the long-term dynamics and response of the littoral fish community, composed mostly of juvenile fish, to environmental change. Here, we study the response of total catch per unit effort (CPUE) and individual species CPUE of such a community to 17 years of oligotrophication and examine whether the species responses can be characterised as synchronous or asynchronous. We analyse a data set of beach seine catches carried out during morning and twilight, late spring and late summer at three sites in large and deep Lake Constance from 1997 to 2014. Generalised additive mixed models were used to explore changes in CPUE of the overall community and of the most frequently occurring species, and Kendall's W test was applied to examine whether the dynamics of fish species were synchronous or asynchronous. Species-specific and total CPUE strongly differed between morning and twilight and between spring and summer indicating an important role of behavioural and life cycle adaptations of species for CPUE. In addition, also the CPUE of some species seeking shelter behind larger stones was lower at sites without these. Total CPUE did not decline suggesting the overall abundance of littoral fish was resilient to declining nutrients. In contrast, fish community composition changed strongly during the study period due to increases in some species (dace, loach, perch) and decreases in others (bream, burbot, chub, ruffe), indicating response diversity of fish to oligotrophication. The type of community dynamics was scale-dependent, whereby significantly synchronous dynamics according to Kendall's W were observed when taking seasonal variability into account. In contrast, significantly asynchronous species dynamics were observed when only the low-frequency variability of species dynamics was considered separately for spring and summer time series. Resilience of littoral fish total CPUE to oligotrophication might have important consequences for ecosystem dynamics and ecosystem services beyond the littoral zone. As small fish often impose strong predation pressure on zooplankton, their resilience might sustain a high top-down control on zooplankton resulting in a further reduction of zooplankton biomass. This could contribute to delayed food web responses and reduced growth of fish with oligotrophication.

Redox conditions in the water columns of lakes typically vary seasonally, and therefore lakes may also be sources of nitrous oxide (N2O). In this study, we measured the weekly water column concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O in a boreal lake and calculated the annual emissions of these gases for the years 2011 and 2012. We found that the emissions of all the gases studied were high right after the ice melt, CH4 most likely originating from the catchment. Bottom anoxia in summer induced maximum concentrations of CH4 and N2O near the sediment, but only elevated the emission of N2O in autumn 2012. Otherwise, the high concentrations near the sediment did not affect the surface concentrations. The unstable water column in summer 2012 increased the CO2 and N2O emissions, but prevented anoxia, and thus decreased the CH4 concentrations. From the perspective of global warming, the CO2 emissions were by far the most significant and the relevance of the N2O emissions was negligible.					; Mammarella, Ivan/E-7782-2016; Aaltonen, Hermanni/MTB-6581-2025; Pumpanen, Jukka/B-1254-2012	Miettinen, Heli/0000-0002-2676-2180; Mammarella, Ivan/0000-0002-8516-3356; Rantakari, Miitta Maria/0000-0003-2335-6192; Aaltonen, Hermanni/0000-0002-8672-0433; Pumpanen, Jukka/0000-0003-4879-3663; 													1239-6095	1797-2469				FEB 27	2015	20	1					75	89																WOS:000350935900006

This indicated a seasonal pulse increase of bioavailable Hg associated with thermal destratification. The effect was more pronounced in juvenile bass (70-200% seasonal increases in muscle Hg concentration), as compared to adults (15-25% increases), and was most distinct in zooplankton, which spiked to concentrations of 3-6 mg/kg, dry weight, immediately following fall destratification (130-270% seasonal increases over pre-fall levels), in addition to the general buildup of methyl Hg in the hypolimnion under anoxic conditions, a dense layer of photosynthetic anaerobic bacteria just beneath the thermocline is implicated as a potentially important seasonal source of methyl Hg to reservoir fish. Hg increases in juvenile and adult fish correspond to late summer and fall entrainment of upper hypolimnetic water, while zooplankton spike increases may be partially related to ingestion or adsorption of Hg-scavenging manganese oxides, which precipitate following full turnover. A simple and effective, syringe-based cold vapor atomic absorption method for total Hg is also described.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					841	850		10.1007/BF01189735	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189735													WOS:A1995RM44200090

Sources of Nitrite in Streams of an Intensively Cropped Watershed	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The sources of high in-stream nitrite (NO2-) concentrations were investigated in two major streams located in an intensively cropped watershed in Quebec, Canada. Nitrogen retention was determined to evaluate the dynamics in relation to nitrogen transport along both stream branches during summer-low-water and fall-recharge regimes. In the first stream branch, NO2- and ammonium (NH4+) showed removal patterns during summer-low-water and fall-recharge periods, whereas, in the second branch, NO2- and NH4+ exports occurred during both hydrologic regimes. The study also demonstrated that seepage water is a source of NO2- instream, which varies within the watershed stream branches and with the hydrologic regime. The results highlighted a significant reductive microbial activity in seepage water from either denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), leading to nitrate (NO3-) consumption. Differences in groundwater NO3- concentrations feeding each stream branch may have significantly influenced NH4+ and NO2- concentrations found in seepage water, which potentially resulted in quantitatively significant NO2- formation.

Climate fluctuations during the past two millennia as recorded in sediments from Maxwell Bay, South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica	FJORD SYSTEMS AND ARCHIVES	Geological Society Special Publication											The climate evolution of the South Shetland Islands during the last c. 2000 years is inferred from the multiproxy analyses of a long (928 cm) sediment core retrieved from Maxwell Bay off King George Island. The vertical sediment flux at the core location is controlled by summer melting processes that cause sediment-laden meltwater plumes to form. These leave a characteristic signature in the sediments of NE Maxwell Bay. We use this signature to distinguish summer and winter-dominated periods. During the Medieval Warm Period, sediments are generally finer which indicates summer-type conditions. In contrast, during the Little Ice Age (LIA) sediments are generally coarser and are indicative of winter-dominated conditions. Comparison with Northern and Southern Hemisphere, Antarctic, and global temperature reconstructions reveals that the mean grain-size curve from Maxwell Bay closely resembles the curve of the global temperature reconstruction. We show that the medieval warming occurred earlier in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere, which might indicate that the warming was driven by processes occurring in the south. The beginning of the LIA appears to be almost synchronous in both hemispheres. The warming after the LIA closely resembles the Northern Hemisphere record which might indicate this phase of cooling was driven by processes occurring in the north. Although the recent rapid regional warming is clearly visible, the Maxwell Bay record does not show the dominance of summer-type sediments until the 1970s. Continued warming in this area will likely affect the marine ecosystem through meltwater induced turbidity of the surface waters as well as an extension of the vegetation period due to the predicted decrease of sea ice in this area.

The current study examined the effect of broad-scale climate and individual-specific covariates on nest survival in smallmouth bass over a 20-year period. 2. Large-scale climate indices [winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and winter El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)] and body size of parental males were important covariates in nest survival along with nest age and a quadratic trend in survival. 3. We did not find an effect due to a habitat covariate (total effective fetch) or a phenology covariate (degree-days at start of nesting) on nest survival. 4. Male size in the second half of the nesting season was a more influential covariate on nest success than male size in the first half or throughout the nesting period. 5. We present evidence showing that winter NAO/ENSO indices establish limnological conditions the following spring that influence thermal stability of the lake during the nesting period. 6. The combined climate and body size covariates point to nest survival as a function of lagged climate-scale influences on limnology and the individual-scale influence of bioenergetics on the duration of parental care and nest success.

We used relative warp analysis and thin-plate splines to demonstrate that normalized biomass spectra were similar among sampling dates and among sites, although statistically significant seasonal patterns were detected. The relative abundance of the smallest organisms (mainly early instars of chironomid larvae between 0.1 and 1 mm long) varied the most and peaked in early summer in warm waters, leading to a reduction of the average size of invertebrates in early summer. Overall abundance also positively but weakly correlated with periphyton standing stock. Average size was larger in urban streams of Ottawa-Hull than in streams in cottage areas of the Outaouais or draining the protected forests of Gatineau Park, even after accounting for the effect of periphyton standing stock and concentration of total phosphorus. Total community production, estimated using the average size distribution in all sites and a published empirical model predicting instantaneous growth rate, peaked in early summer and reached a minimum in winter, following closely the seasonal water temperature pattern. The contribution of organisms smaller than I mm to total community production was only significant in early summer when it reached 20%.

Illegal hunting of gazelles has been largely prevented since 2002, leaving fencing of pastures as one of the main threats to the gazelle. We conducted surveys on 810km of parallel transects on 8 gazelle-occupied sites and 4 nearby control sites where no gazelles were found, and evaluated the impact of fencing on gazelle distribution. A comparison of gazelle-occupied and control sites showed the former had a lower fence density and height, lower aboveground biomass (EVI), and a longer distance to houses. Logistic regression indicated that the presence of gazelle feces on the 1-km segment of transect was negatively affected by the density of fences and the proportion of fences with barbed wire both in spring and summer. In addition, we found a negative effect from distance to houses in spring and from EVI in summer. Gazelles did not occur more on grasslands with greater vegetation biomass, possibly because of the association of greater vegetation biomass with greater fence density and proportion of barbed wires. Although removing fences can be costly, lowering the top barbed wire, as well as constructing special gates and seasonal use of existing gates, may be beneficial for this endangered species at minimal disruption to local people.

Water temperature dynamics and heat transport in a typical Japanese river	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The water temperature regime of the Oita River on Kyushu Island (33 degrees N latitude) in southern Japan is illustrated and analyzed, and related to the river's hydrology. The river is short (55 km) and steep (ave. slope = 0.088), and has a flashy flow regime. Precipitation is high (1653 mm year(-1)) and divided between a wet monsoon season, typhoons, and a dry season in winter. A base flow analysis showed that groundwater contributes about 50 % of the annual flow to the Oita River and controls the river's heat budget. At a measured mean annual temperature of similar to 16 degrees C, groundwater (base flow) input causes unexpected cool (<= 24 degrees C) river temperatures in summer and warm (>= 8 degrees C) river temperatures in winter. The Oita River is typical of many Japanese rivers. Its hydraulic residence time is very short (0.5-1.5 days) and limits the heat exchange with the atmosphere so that a significant deficit remains between observed river water temperatures and equilibrium temperatures in mid-summer and mid-winter. Correlations of recorded stream temperatures with atmospheric temperatures (air, dew point and equilibrium temperatures) were strong. Weekly air and stream temperature data (averaged from 10-min measurements) were fitted by linear regressions with R-2 = 0.98 and RMSE = 0.83 degrees C. Daily data were only slightly less well correlated with R-2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 1.17 degrees C. The relationships were highly linear. The slope of the stream temperature vs. air temperature correlation was in the range from 0.63 (weekly) to 0.58 (daily) indicating that stream temperatures are dominated by groundwater input. Air and stream temperatures have a strong correlation in both wet (monsoon) and dry seasons, and geothermal heat input has no basin-wide effect; the 50 % groundwater (base flow) input raises the annual mean and reduces seasonal temperature amplitude in the Oita River and provides a cool-water stream. Water temperatures were gathered from a long-term monitoring database and by recent (2012-2013) high-resolution instream monitoring. Key drivers of stream temperature were identified. Linear regressions were used to relate air temperature, dew point temperature, and equilibrium temperature with stream temperature. Groundwater was identified as a key input of water consistently around 16 degrees C, moderating temperatures in the summer and winter due to very short water residence times in the steep and short river. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge about global stream temperatures, and clarifies specific questions for Japanese rivers.

J	Winder, M; Schindler, DE				Winder, M; Schindler, DE			Climatic effects on the phenology of lake processes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Populations living in seasonal environments are exposed to systematic changes in physical conditions that restrict the growth and reproduction of many species to only a short time window of the annual cycle. Several studies have shown that climate changes over the latter part of the 20th century affected the phenology and population dynamics of single species. However, the key limitation to forecasting the effects of changing climate on ecosystems lies in understanding how it will affect interactions among species. We investigated the effects of climatic and biotic drivers on physical and biological lake processes, using a historical dataset of 40 years from Lake Washington, USA, and dynamic time-series models to explain changes in the phenological patterns among physical and biological components of pelagic ecosystems. Long-term climate warming and variability because of large-scale climatic patterns like Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) extended the duration of the stratification period by 25 days over the last 40 years. This change was due mainly to earlier spring stratification (16 days) and less to later stratification termination in fall (9 days). The phytoplankton spring bloom advanced roughly in parallel to stratification onset and in 2002 it occurred about 19 days earlier than it did in 1962, indicating the tight connection of spring phytoplankton growth to turbulent conditions. In contrast, the timing of the clear-water phase showed high variability and was mainly driven by biotic factors. Among the zooplankton species, the timing of spring peaks in the rotifer Keratella advanced strongly, whereas Leptodiaptomus and Daphnia showed slight or no changes. These changes have generated a growing time lag between the spring phytoplankton peak and zooplankton peak, which can be especially critical for the cladoceran Daphnia. Water temperature, PDO, and food availability affected the timing of the spring peak in zooplankton. Overall, the impact of PDO on the phenological processes were stronger compared with ENSO. Our results highlight that climate affects physical and biological processes differently, which can interrupt energy flow among trophic levels, making ecosystem responses to climate change difficult to forecast.

These frost occurrence variables are estimated using a combination of channel-5 (11.5-12.5 mum) infrared brightness temperature data and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite instrument. It is shown that a generalized linear model with quasi-likelihood estimation is best suited to the estimation of these frost occurrence variables. The maps show that frosts occur earlier in the autumn and later in the spring with increasing distance away from the coast and from major rivers and lakes. Frost is most prevalent on the top of high mountain ranges where the air temperature is coldest and is shown to be more common near the bottom of inland basins as compared with the sides of the surrounding hills because of cold-air drainage and ponding.																			0894-8763					FEB	2003	42	2					193	203		10.1175/1520-0450(2003)042<0193:MFOUSD>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2003)042<0193:MFOUSD>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000180667200003

Such low summertime oxygen contents especially affect benthic life. The seasonal coastal hypoxia is commonly related to biological increased respiration and to physical limited vertical turbulent exchange that is associated with increased vertical stable density stratification. However, the same stratification can support internal waves that may break and locally generate turbulence. Here, we investigate the physics of internal wave motions in saltwater Lake Grevelingen (SW-Netherlands) during warming in mid-spring. Grevelingen is refreshed by weak tidal motions through an open sluice in its dam to the North Sea. The outer North Sea has a surface tidal range of about 3 m, but the lake surface tidal range is negligible (< 0.1 m). To quantify vertical turbulent exchange, high-resolution temperature sensors were moored in conjunction with a current meter in 36 m water depth for three days. The site is known for anoxic conditions near the bottom in summer. While a 3-day, 30-m mean eddy diffusivity of < [K-z] > = 4 +/- 2 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1) is found, the overall mean turbulence dissipation rate (turbulent flux) is < [epsilon] > = 1.1 +/- 0.6 x 10(-7) m(2) s(-3). Turbulent mixing occurs episodically, via near-surface cooling during night and increased winds, via sparse shear-driven breaking of internal waves at the main pycnocline, and via sheared near-bottom currents. Shear-driven turbulence is not commonly found in fresh-water lakes. Just below the main pycnocline around mid-depth a layer of weak turbulence is observed, as in fresh-water lakes. The observed turbulent exchange is sufficient to warm the near-bottom waters over the course of summer, but insufficient to prevent the biology from over-consuming oxygen contents.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				OCT 15	2019	226								106298	10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106298													WOS:000482495700028
J	Chi, SY; Hu, J; Li, M; Wan, CY				Chi, Shiyun; Hu, Jun; Li, Ming; Wan, Chenyan			What Are the Relationships between Plankton and Macroinvertebrates in Reservoir Systems?	WATER												Macroinvertebrates and plankton play crucial roles in reservoir food webs; however, their relationships have received limited attention. This study investigates the associations between plankton and macroinvertebrates in fifty selected reservoirs. During the spring season, significant concordances were observed in species richness between phytoplankton and zooplankton, as well as between zooplankton and macroinvertebrates. In contrast, during the summer season, the concordance in species richness between phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates was higher compared to other assemblages. Although macroinvertebrates showed a strong connection with phytoplankton in terms of species richness in both seasons, the congruencies were not statistically significant. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis revealed that the densities of phytoplankton, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, and protozoans significantly influenced the total macroinvertebrate density in both seasons. Additionally, the densities of mollusks and aquatic insects were affected by the densities of Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta, while the density of oligochaetes was influenced by the density of Chlorophyta. These findings indicated that phytoplankton and zooplankton serve as primary food sources for macroinvertebrates, highlighting the close relationship between plankton and macroinvertebrates in reservoir systems. Moreover, the results of formative measurement models indicated a strong association between zooplankton and macroinvertebrates during the spring, whereas phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates exhibited a close association during the summer. The substantial concordance in density between phytoplankton and zooplankton revealed by the formative measurement models confirmed that assemblages with similar body sizes exhibit stronger concordance compared to those with significant differences in body size.																				2073-4441				AUG	2023	15	15							2682	10.3390/w15152682	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15152682													WOS:001046375700001

When "evaporites" are not formed by evaporation: The role of temperature and pCO2 on saline deposits of the Eocene Green River Formation, Colorado, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Halite precipitates in the Dead Sea during winter but re-dissolves above the thermocline upon summer warming, "focusing" halite deposition below the thermocline (Sirota et al., 2016, 2017, 2018). Here we develop an "evaporite focusing" model for evaporites (nahcolite + halite) preserved in a restricted area of the Eocene Green River Formation in the Piceance Creek Basin of Colorado, USA. Nahcolite solubility is dependent on partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) as well as temperature (T), so these models covary with both T and pCO(2). In the lake that filled the Piceance Creek Basin, halite, nahcolite or mixtures of both could have precipitated during winter cooling, depending on the CO2 content in different parts of the lake. Preservation of these minerals occurs below the thermocline (>similar to 25 m) in deeper portions of the basin. Our modeling addresses both: (1) the restriction of evaporites in the Piceance Creek Basin to the center of the basin without recourse to later dissolution and (2) the variable mineralogy of the evaporites without recourse to changes in lake water chemistry. T from 20 to 30 degrees C and pCO(2) between 1800 and 2800 ppm are reasonable estimates for the conditions in the Piceance Creek Basin paleolake. Other evaporites occur in the center of basins but do not extend out to the edges of the basin. Evaporite focusing caused by summer-winter T changes in the solubility of the minerals should be considered for such deposits and variable pCO(2) within the evaporating brines also needs to be considered if pCO(2) sensitive minerals are found.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUL-AUG	2020	132	7-8					1365	1380		10.1130/B35303.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B35303.1													WOS:000545115400002

The spectral distribution of radiation at various levels in the water column was examined by dividing the spectrum into four bands (420-500, 480-570, 560-670 and 750-960 nm), in addition to this the photometric (420-670 nm) and total values (400-960 nm) were measured, too. The transmission of light in water varied greatly during the study period. The dominant wavelengths penetrating deepest in to the water column throughout the year were orange and red as well as green. On the contrary, absorption was strongest at near infrared and blue wavelength regions. Snow cover on the ice had an especially great effect on the diminution of incoming radiation. In early summer radiation penetrated deepest compared with other seasons. In the middle of the summer the absorption caused by algae maximum reduced effectively the light penetration. Towards autumn the absorption of light by water diminished slightly increasing penetration depths of all six wavelength ranges.																			0003-9136					JUN	1993	127	4					497	504																WOS:A1993LQ08700009

Poly- and perfluorinated substances in environmental water from the Hartbeespoort and Roodeplaat Dams, South Africa	WATER SA												Concentrations of poly- and perfluorinated substances (PFASs) were determined in Hartbeespoort and Roodeplaat Dams, South Africa. Water samples were collected from the dams in February-March, and May-June, representing southern hemisphere summer and winter seasons, respectively. Solid phase extraction (SPE) was used to extract the analytes from the water samples and liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) used for analysis. The mean PFAS concentrations detected ranged from 1.38-346.32 ng.L-1 and 2.31-262.29 ng.L-1 in the Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodeplaat Dam, respectively. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) were the most dominant PFASs detected. The PFAS concentrations detected were higher in summer than in winter, but the difference between seasons was not statistically significant (p = 1). Furthermore, the concentrations of short- chain PFASs were higher than the longer chains. Overall, the PFAS concentrations in the present study are comparable to those reported in other parts of South Africa, and also Ghana, higher than the concentrations reported in Uganda, Singapore, and Vietnam, and lower than those in Germany, Japan and China. The measured concentrations of PFOA and PFOS raise concerns of human exposure to these chemicals since they are above the USEPA advisory limit. This suggests that communities living within the vicinity of the dams are most likely to be exposed to these chemicals.

As a result of the study, a total of 76 species have been identified as 50 species belong to Rotifera, 15 species - to Cladocera, and 11 species - to Copepoda. Of these species Proalides tentaculatus de Beuchamp, 1907, Itura myersi WULFERT, 1935, Asplanchnopus hyalinus (HARRING, 1913) are found only in Turkish Thrace. As a result of quantitative evaluation of zooplankton samples, while an average of 35 334 ind./m(3) Rotifera, 19 305 ind./m(3) Cladocera, 72 369 ind./m(3) Copepoda was found an average of 127 008 ind./m(3) zooplankton organisms have been determined in the lake. According to the results of PCA analysis, when looking at the seasonal distribution of zooplankton species, it is seen that species assembled to form three groups as species which appear in spring, summer and winter. According to the results of RDA analysis, correlation (for RDA axis 1 0.956, for RDA axis 2 0.925) between zooplankton organisms and environmental variables being so high shows that Water tem, EC, SO4, Ca, pH, Chl-a, Secchi and PO4, are significant (p = 0.0020) factors determining the distribution of zooplankton organisms in the Lake Gala.

It was collected in West Lake during the 23rd Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition in 2006-2007. The moss was found at a depth of 5-6 m attached to the bed of the lake. The stems of the moss are about 1-1.5 m in length. The moss exhibits seasonal growth patterns, with shorter branch internodes, more widely spaced leaves and more branches in summer than in winter. Most of the branches are initiated in summer. The annual shoot extension is about 3-6 cm, which implies that the plants must be at least 15 years of age.

The northern belt of Pakistan holds the largest storage of freshwater (ice and snow) after the polar region, and provides water to the downstream population for agriculture plus domestic and hydropower resources. This study focuses on a possible explanation for the seemingly declining behavior of Darkut Glacier using evidence from ground observation and climate station data in Yasin and Gupis valleys in northern Pakistan. We analyzed data obtained from two stations includes the Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan (WAPDA, 1995-2010) and the Pakistan Meteorology Department (PMD, 1986-2015). Results of both climate station data depicted an increase in total precipitation and a decrease in winter and spring seasons. The study also highlighted an increase in mean minimum and maximum temperatures, particularly in winter and spring. Similarly, the trend of solar radiation also has decreased. Therefore, enhanced snout fluctuation and the melting rate of Darkut occurred during the study period. All of these changes have had a negative impact on the snout of the glacier, which has retreated 6 m during 2013 and 2016, and a lake has formed behind the terminal moraine.					hussain, iqtidar/AAB-6339-2021; Hussain, Iqtidar/AAB-6339-2021; Ali, Sartaj/GWV-7931-2022; Hussain, Muhammad/AAH-1404-2019; Qamar, Abbas/JZU-0684-2024	hussain, iqtidar/0000-0001-6353-1958; Hussain, Dr. Azhar/0000-0002-5777-2058; 													1230-1485	2083-5906					2018	27	2					665	673		10.15244/pjoes/75960	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/75960													WOS:000424111300021
J	Erhardt, JM; Tiffan, KF				Erhardt, John M.; Tiffan, Kenneth F.			Ecology of nonnative Siberian prawn (Palaemon modestus) in the lower Snake River, Washington, USA	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												We assessed the abundance, distribution, and ecology of the nonnative Siberian prawn Palaemon modestus in the lower Snake River, Washington, USA. Analysis of prawn passage abundance at three Snake River dams showed that populations are growing at exponential rates, especially at Little Goose Dam where over 464,000 prawns were collected in 2015. Monthly beam trawling during 2011-2013 provided information on prawn abundance and distribution in Lower Granite and Little Goose Reservoirs. Zero-inflated regression predicted that the probability of prawn presence increased with decreasing water velocity and increasing depth. Negative binomial models predicted higher catch rates of prawns in deeper water and in closer proximity to dams. Temporally, prawn densities decreased slightly in the summer, likely due to the mortality of older individuals, and then increased in autumn and winter with the emergence and recruitment of young of the year. Seasonal length frequencies showed that distinct juvenile and adult size classes exist throughout the year, suggesting prawns live from 1 to 2 years and may be able to reproduce multiple times during their life. Most juvenile prawns become reproductive adults in 1 year, and peak reproduction occurs from late July through October. Mean fecundity (189 eggs) and reproductive output (11.9 %) are similar to that in their native range. The current use of deep habitats by prawns likely makes them unavailable to most predators in the reservoirs. The distribution and role of Siberian prawns in the lower Snake River food web will probably continue to change as the population grows and warrants continued monitoring and investigation.

Agricultural damage by wildlife is a serious constraint on the coexistence of humans and wildlife. Understanding the behavioural processes involved in such agricultural damage will inform management actions. In this study, a linear programming model based on optimal foraging theory was used to formulate management strategies designed to reduce wheat damage caused by white-fronted geese Anser albifrons around Lake Miyajimanuma in Japan. 2. Geese feed on rice grains or wheat leaves. Their choice of food is constrained by their daily energy requirement, daily nitrogen requirement, digestive capacity and daily maximum foraging time. With these constraints, we predicted the proportion of geese that should forage on wheat leaves under energy-maximizing, nitrogen-maximizing and time-minimizing strategies, and compared the results with the observed proportion. 3. Our predictions for the energy-maximizing strategy successfully explained the variation in the observed proportion of geese foraging on wheat leaves. It appeared that nitrogen constraints drove the geese to forage on wheat in autumn, but energy considerations drove the geese to forage on wheat plus rice in late spring. 4. Based on these results, we predicted that by increasing the harvest remains of rice by 30%, a large reduction in wheat damage could be achieved both in autumn and in spring. Damage could be reduced further by supplying protein-rich food, such as grass on fallow fields and on ridges of rice fields in autumn, and by leaving geese foraging in rice fields undisturbed. 5. Synthesis and applications. Optimal foraging models that consider foraging goals and constraints have considerable potential for identifying measures for minimizing agricultural damage problems caused by grazing bird species. Specifically, for geese grazing on wheat fields in Japan, we advocate increasing the availability of alternative protein-rich foods, such as rice harvest remains and grass, and minimizing disturbance to geese foraging on rice fields.

Chlorophyll-a levels were low both in spring and in summer, probably due to the high discharge in 1995 as compared to other years. Nutrients were never depleted. Zooplankton densities were very low. Diatoms and green algae had positive net apparent growth rates of 0.38 d(-1) and 1.01 d(-1), respectively, as calculated from cell counts. Grazing experiments estimated the zooplankton grazing rate in the order of 0.05 d(-1) or 8% of the chlorophyll-based growth rate. As in previous years, the plankton densities decreased in the lower part of the Rhine. The loss rate could not be explained by zooplankton grazing, respiration and sedimentation. From earlier published data the potential impact of benthic filter feeders was calculated. This exercise suggests that filtration by zoobenthos can explain the observed decrease in plankton density in the Rhine.																			0018-8158						1999	410						1	10		10.1023/A:1003801110365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003801110365													WOS:000084826000002
J	Konstantinou, IK; Hela, DG; Albanis, TA				Konstantinou, IK; Hela, DG; Albanis, TA			The status of pesticide pollution in surface waters (rivers and lakes) of Greece. Part I. Review on occurrence and levels	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												This review evaluates and summarizes the results of long-term research projects, monitoring programs and published papers concerning the pollution of surface waters (rivers and lakes) of Greece by pesticides. Pesticide classes mostly detected involve herbicides used extensively in corn, cotton and rice production, organophosphorus insecticides as well as the banned organochlorines insecticides due to their persistence in the aquatic environment. The compounds most frequently detected were atrazine, simazine, alachlor, metolachlor and trifluralin of the herbicides, diazinon, parathion methyl of the insecticides and lindane, endosulfan and aldrin of the organochlorine pesticides. Rivers were found to be more polluted than lakes. The detected concentrations of most pesticides follow a seasonal variation, with maximum values occurring during the late spring and summer period followed by a decrease during winter. Nationwide, in many cases the reported concentrations ranged in low ppb levels. However, elevated concentrations were recorded in areas of high pesticide use and intense agricultural practices. Generally, similar trends and levels of pesticides were found in Greek rivers compared to pesticide contamination in other European rivers. Monitoring of the Greek water resources for pesticide residues must continue, especially in agricultural regions, because the nationwide patterns of pesticide use are constantly changing. Moreover, emphasis should be placed on degradation products not sufficiently studied so far. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Diversion of sewage did not change its trophic status, so restoration began in autumn 2011 using the sustainable approach based on three methods. The aim of the study was to analyse how sustainable restoration affects zooplankton. We hypothesised that bottom-up and top-down methods reconstructed zooplankton composition. Thus, the abundance of large-size cladocerans increased and controlled phytoplankton effectively. The elimination of cyanobacteria bloom, the decrease of rotifer abundance and the twofold increase of filter-feeder effectiveness were observed in summer 2012. However, high phosphorus concentration, lack of regular cyprinid removal and insufficient fish stocking together with high temperature prevented zooplankton from controlling cyanobacteria bloom in summer 2013. Rotifer domination with high trophy species was noted, as before restoration. The number of rotifers decreased in 2014, while crustaceans increased due to the significant decrease of nutrient concentrations and an intensification of biomanipulation treatments. Therefore, summer phytoplankton growth was low, without cyanobacteria dominance. The rebuilding of zooplankton in Swarzdzkie Lake was observed during sustainable restoration. However, the treatments should be intensified when adverse changes were observed to obtain better results for the improvement of water quality.

Differential stimulation and suppression of phytoplankton growth by ammonium enrichment in eutrophic hardwater lakes over 16 years	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Previous research suggests that fertilization of surface waters with chemically reduced nitrogen (N), including ammonium (NH4+), may either enhance or suppress phytoplankton growth. To identify the factors influencing the net effect of NH4+, we fertilized natural phytoplankton assemblages from two eutrophic hardwater lakes with growth-saturating concentrations of NH4Cl in 241 incubation experiments conducted biweekly May-August during 1996-2011. Phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) was significantly (p < 0.05) altered in fertilized trials relative to controls after 72 h in 44.8% of experiments, with a marked rise in both spring suppression and summer stimulation of assemblages over 16 yr, as revealed by generalized additive models (GAMs). Binomial GAMs were used to compare contemporaneous changes in physico-chemical (temperature, Secchi depth, pH, nutrients; 19.5% deviance explained) and biological parameters (phytoplankton community composition; 40.0% deviance explained) to results from fertilization experiments. Models revealed that that the likelihood of growth suppression by NH4+ increased with abundance of diatoms, cryptophytes, and unicellular cyanobacteria, particularly when water temperatures and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations were low. In contrast, phytoplankton was often stimulated by NH4+ when chlorophytes and non-N-2-fixing cyanobacteria were abundant, and temperatures and SRP concentrations were high. Progressive intensification of NH4+ effects over 16 yr reflects changes in both spring (cooler water, increased diatoms and cryptophytes) and summer lake conditions (more chlorophytes, earlier cyanobacteria blooms), suggesting that the seasonal effects of NH4+ will vary with future climate change and modes of N enrichment.					; Glibert, Patricia/G-1026-2013; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; glibert, patricia/G-1026-2013	Swarbrick, Vanessa/0000-0002-9323-6172; Glibert, Patricia/0000-0001-5690-1674; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2019	64			1	SI		S130	S149		10.1002/lno.11093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11093													WOS:000456164100012

Local site variation in stopover physiology of migrating songbirds near the south shore of Lake Ontario is linked to fruit availability and quality	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Birds that migrate long distances between breeding and wintering grounds are challenged to find adequate stopover sites that can provide a high-quality source of nutrition in order to refuel quickly and continue on their migratory journeys. Wild fruits are a well-documented component in the diets of many passerines during autumn migration. Thus, fruit availability and the proliferation of shrubs that bear low-quality fruits at important stopover sites may dictate the quality of food resources available for refuelling birds and present a conservation concern. We profiled plasma metabolites of two migratory passerine species at two different stopover sites near the south shore of Lake Ontario during the peak of autumn migration. We also measured diversity, availability and nutritional quality of fruits present at these sites. Site explained most of the variation in plasma triglyceride for both bird species, but was less important than other confounding variables for explaining concentrations of plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and plasma uric acid concentrations. Site differences in fat deposition, as indicated by plasma triglyceride, may in part be explained by the large differences in diversity and availability of high-quality fruits between the two sites. Our results suggest that abundant, lipid-rich native fruits with high-energy density are associated with increased fat deposition during autumn stopovers for some species, although other factors, such as proximity to the Lake Ontario shoreline and the opportunities to refuel in the surrounding landscape, are likely to play a role in stopover site use by birds. It is possible that local site characteristics that influence growing conditions may impact the quality of fruits produced by a plant species, altering the availability of critical nutrients for avian consumers.																			2051-1434					AUG 13	2015	3								cov036	10.1093/conphys/cov036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/conphys/cov036								27293721					WOS:000375199800001

This study evaluated the abiotic and biotic conditions of the lake water (e.g., physicochemical variables, bacterial communities, and phytoplankton structures and their biochemical contents) from 11 sites along the lake in winter and summer 2020. The results revealed that the increase in phytoplankton densities and chlorophyll (a) in winter combined with increased nutrient contents. The highest concentrations of the biochemical contents of phytoplankton and the highest enumerations of bacterial indicators were recorded during summer. The sites close to the inlets of drains recorded a complete depletion of oxygen and a high ammonia content. The highest phytoplankton standing crop was recorded in the middle sector of the lake. Despite the efforts of the Egyptian government to rehabilitate Manzala Lake since 2017, the results showed an increase in pollution levels at various sites and the continued deterioration of the lake???s ecological status. These results confirm the importance of increasing the efforts to restore the environmental health status of the lake, primarily by treating wastewater before it is discharged into the lake.

However, common-used grab samplers are efficient in collecting surface-dwelling species (< 20 cm), thus vertical migrations of dominant species may interfere bioassessment. Here, we monthly investigated the vertical sediment positioning of P. akamusi larvae and its influence on bioassessment. Our results indicated that, from late-April to October, most individuals aestivated at the sediment below 30 cm depth which maybe an adaptation to the thermal stress. As to other periods, the larvae were generally found in the depth of 10-30 cm. Moreover, Peterson grab samples collected only 0% and 12.6% of total P. akamusi individuals in summer and late-autumn, respectively, resulting in serious underestimation of the actual pollution status. This implied that vertical movements of dominant macroinvertebrates should be taken into account when designing of bioassessment protocols. For P. akamusi, Core-sampling for calibration were strongly encouraged, and the low-temperature period for Grab-sampling is also proposed.

Between 2009 and 2011, densities of gobies in the Rhine increased while their condition decreased, assuming that the populations are approaching or even reached the capacity of the ecosystem. Consequently, we hypothesized a high level of competition on food resources within this group of invasive gobies that all exhibit the same sedentary life style, which might strengthen the differentiation of the ecological niche on a spatial and temporal axis. Invasive gobies were caught with electro fishing and beach seining in different types of habitats over a period of two years in the Lower Rhine, analyzing the food of more than 1500 gobies of the three species Neogobius fluviatilis (NF), Neogobius melanostomus (NM) and Ponticola kessleri (PK). All species showed an opportunistic feeding strategy. In NF and PK, a clear shift in preferred food resources was observed between individuals smaller and larger 50 mm that occurred in parallel with a habitat shift from sandy areas to riprap structures in PK, but not in NF that were only found on gravel and sand. In contrast, there were no distinct changes in food and habitat preference in NM. Small NM were found from spring to autumn on the sandy nearshore areas where they competed on food resources with juvenile PK in spring, and with NF in late summer, respectively. Abundance of juvenile NF and NM increased during the night in sandy nearshore areas in October: This behavior is assumed as predator avoidance against large piscivorous NF as well as native pikeperch, because active feeding occurred mainly during the day. The results on the three invasive Gobiids in the Lower Rhine give important hints how fine-tuned spatial and temporal characteristics in intra- and inter-specific competition shape the ecological niche of these invaders in their new environment.

Organochlorine pesticides	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												From May to September 2005, five passive air samples were deployed over five, 1-month periods at five elevations on the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada, to investigate the vertical distribution, seasonality, and sources of organochlorine pesticides. A strong seasonality was observed between spring and the end of summer. Vertical profiles differed for different pesticide classes. For instance, alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane exhibited higher concentrations (60-80 pg m(-3), respectively) near the ground during the spring and early summer, suggesting that surface-air exchange within the city or nearby Lake Ontario may be important sources. The vertical profile for chlordane isomers was variable, suggesting that both advective and local inputs are important. For dieldrin, no obvious trend with elevation was observed, suggesting that concentrations could reflect a regional air mass contamination. Strongest seasonality was observed for the endosulfans, a widely used pesticide in North America, that reached peak concentrations of 750-850 pg m(-3) during June/July. Advective inputs of endosulfan from regional or more distant agricultural regions can explain the relatively uniform concentrations with elevation throughout the study period. The approach used in this study demonstrates that monthly average vertical concentration profiles differ between pesticide groups and reflect their use as well as the relative magnitude of input from local versus regional sources.

Ebullition drives high methane emissions from a eutrophic coastal basin	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The production of methane in coastal sediments and its release to the water column is intensified by anthropogenic eutrophication and bottom water hypoxia, and it is still uncertain whether methane emissions to the atmosphere will be enhanced. Here, we assess seasonal variations in methane dynamics in a eutrophic, seasonally euxinic coastal basin (Scharendijke, Lake Grevelingen). In-situ benthic chamber incubations reveal high rates of methane release from the sediment to the water column (74-163 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) during monthly measurements between March and October 2021. Comparison of these in-situ total benthic methane fluxes and calculated diffusive fluxes point towards a major role for ebullition. In spring and fall, when the water column was oxic, microbial removal of dissolved methane occurred aerobically in the bottom water. In summer, in contrast, dissolved methane accumulated to concentrations of up to 67 mu mol L-1 below the oxycline. Shifts in delta C-13-CH4 and delta D-CH4 towards higher values and the abundant presence of methane oxidizing bacteria point towards removal of methane around the oxycline, likely through both aerobic and anaerobic pathways, with the latter possibly linked to iron oxide reduction. Shifts in delta C-13-CH4 and delta D-CH4 to lower values above the oxycline indicate that bubble dissolution contributed to dissolved methane. Methane emissions to the atmosphere were observed in all seasons with the highest, in-situ measured diffusive fluxes (1.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) upon the onset of water column mixing at the end of summer. Methane release events during the measurement of in-situ water-air fluxes and model calculations point towards a flux of methane to the atmosphere in the form of bubbles, which bypass the microbial methane filter. The model calculations suggest a potential year-round ebullitive methane flux between 30 and 120 mmol m(-2) d(-1). We conclude that methane emissions from eutrophic coastal systems may be much higher than previously thought because of ebullition.					; Slomp, Caroline/A-9406-2012; Veraart, Annelies/E-1927-2014; Röckmann, Thomas/F-4479-2015; Jetten, Mike/B-8834-2011; Klomp, Robin/HNS-2915-2023; Rockmann, Thomas/F-4479-2015	Venetz, Jessica/0000-0002-9654-0532; van Helmond, Niels/0000-0003-0024-7217; Klomp, Robin/0009-0008-3588-6792; Zygadlowska, Olga/0000-0003-1457-4454; Lenstra, Wytze/0000-0003-0979-5594; Rockmann, Thomas/0000-0002-6688-8968													0016-7037	1872-9533				NOV 1	2024	384						1	13		10.1016/j.gca.2024.08.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2024.08.028		SEP 2024											WOS:001314285300001
J	KLEMER, A; BARKO, J				KLEMER, A; BARKO, J			EFFECTS OF MIXING AND SILICA ENRICHMENT ON PHYTOPLANKTON SEASONAL SUCCESSION	HYDROBIOLOGIA												During the summer of 1983, cryptophytes, diatoms, cyanophytes, and the dinoflagellate, Ceratium hirundinella were most prominant among the phytoplankton of Eau Galle Reservoir. In the open water, cryptophytes and diatoms peaked in the spring, cyanophytes were most successful in the early summer, and Ceratium was dominant from mid-July until early August. In general, the sequence of events corresponded quite closely to the model of seasonal succession developed by the Plankton Ecology Group of the International Society of Limnology. To a large extent, the same pattern held in four experimental water columns. Departures from the model involved the roles of specific nutrients in diatom and cyanophyte periodicity. Diatoms began to yield to cyanophytes in late spring despite intermittent mixing and silica enrichment. Although capable of buoyancy regulation and thus well adapted to stable water columns, cyanophytes had greater increases in biomass in mixed columns, and in those columns, were most successful during a period of intermittent mixing. Cyanophyte success varied inversely with TN:TP ratios during the period of intermittent mixing, but not subsequently. By mid-July, Ceratium dominated the phytoplankton of every column except that of a mixed column in which conditions favored cyanophytes and large diatom species.																			0018-8158					MAR 8	1991	210	3					171	181		10.1007/BF00034675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00034675													WOS:A1991FF63700002

This study systematically analyses hydrometeorological and stable isotope data from precipitation, river, and reservoir waters using the hydrological observation system at Hongyashan Reservoir. The study revealed that the reservoir notably altered local water cycle processes. The stable isotope compositions of surface water show the changing characteristics of enrichment in summer and depletion in spring and fall, while evaporation controls the stable isotope compositions of surface water in Hongyashan Reservoir. Precipitation in the Hongyashan Reservoir primarily comes from westerly water vapour transport, significantly affected by local intra-continental water vapour recirculation. The average annual evaporation loss from Hongyashan Reservoir is 14.72%, and the contribution ratio of locally recirculated water vapour to precipitation ranges from 18.85% to 38.9%. Our findings highlight the need to consider the impact of local reservoirs on hydrological processes when assessing water resources in arid zones, and to address water losses caused by reservoirs.					; Zhu, Guofeng/AAP-4570-2020; Li, Rui/HLW-3197-2023	Zhu, Guofeng/0000-0003-0572-7041; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL	2025	39	7							e70200	10.1002/hyp.70200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.70200													WOS:001527233700001
J	Gao, HS; Zhang, S; Li, WB; Tao, YL				Gao, Hengshuai; Zhang, Sheng; Li, Wenbao; Tao, Yulong			Analyzing the Vertical Recharge Mechanism of Groundwater Using Ion Characteristics and Water Quality Indexes in Lake Hulun	WATER												The water level of Lake Hulun has changed dramatically in recent years. The interannual interaction between groundwater and lake water is an important factor affecting Lake Hulun's water level. Vertical recharge between groundwater and the lake is particularly important. Based on an analysis of differences between the hydrogeochemical and water quality characteristics of the spring water, the lake water, and the surrounding groundwater, the source and recharge mechanism of the spring water in the vertical recharge lake are determined. The results show that spring water is exposed at the bottom of Lake Hulun, and there are obvious differences between spring water and lake water in lake ice thickness, ion characteristics, and water quality characteristics. For example, the ice thickness at the spring site is only 6.8% of the average ice thickness of the lake, and there is a triangular area directly above the spring water area that is not covered by ice; the ion contents of the spring water at the lake bottom were less than 50% of those in the lake water; and the NH4+-N content of the spring water at the lake bottom was only 3.0% of the mean content of the lake water. In addition, the total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO), and NH4+-N contents of the spring water at the lake bottom all fall outside the range of contents of the surrounding groundwater. In general, the source of the spring water at the lake bottom is not recharged by the infiltration recharge of the phreatic aquifer but by the vertical recharge of the confined aquifer. Additionally, the Lake Hulun basin may be supplied with confined water through basalt channels while it is frozen. The vertical groundwater recharge mechanism may be that spring water at the lake bottom is first supplied by the deep, confined aquifer flowing through the fault zone to the loose-sediment phreatic aquifer under the lake, and finally interacts with the lake water through the phreatic aquifer.

J	BAND, HT				BAND, HT			HOST SHIFTS OF CHYMOMYZA-AMOENA (DIPTERA, DROSOPHILIDAE)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Chymomyza amonena (Loew) is a domestic species that has expanded its host niche to breed and overwinter in apples in Michigan and the mid-South. Populations remain mutivoltine throughout the latitudes investigated, East Jordan, Mich. (45.10.degree.N) to Eden, N.C. (36.29.degree.N). A new generation can be produced within a month during the breeding season. Populations remain polymorphic for developmental time. The polymorphism has been investigated in apples, but lengthy emergence from crabapples indicates it predated in invasion of apples. Populations overwinter in the larval stage in Michigan; the pupal stage may be the overwintering stage in milder climates or it may be entered early in spring. Populations within Michigan and between Michigan, Missouri and mid-South have been interfertile. This species has a longer prefertile period than Drosophila melanogaster. Comparisons of the oviposition rate of pairs captured in nature with laboratory crosses involving aged and nonaged parents indicate that females in nature do not approach males until past their prefertile period. Multiple use of endemic host plants for breeding has been investigated in mid-Michigan. Females emerging from black walnut husks prefer to oviposit on softened, overwintered native crabapples; females emergining from crabapples early in summer can breed in immature, unripe fallen domestic apples or plums. Females rely on pest species to attack firm substrates first and oviposit in scars, holes or directly in frass when available. Both males and females are attracted to sites where other C. amoena have oviposited. Later in summer females will also oviposit on unfallen fruits. Larvae pupate within the substrate or in soil. Studies at Mt. Lake Biological Station where other chymomyzid species occur show that males will court inter- or intraspecifically. Capture-in-the-air is an alternate mating system in this species to the assault-type mating predominant in this, other drosophilids and other Diptera. The simple courtship and other behaviors are described. Population size is small and, to date, there is no evidence of sympatric of allopatric speciation.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JUL	1988	120	1					163	182		10.2307/2425897	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425897													WOS:A1988P861200017
J	Xin, F; Wang, W				Xin, Fei; Wang, Wei			Extended-Range Forecast of Winter Rainfall in the Yangtze River Delta Based on Intra-Seasonal Oscillation of Atmospheric Circulations	ATMOSPHERE												The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is an important economic region in China. Heavy winter rainfall may pose serious threats to city operations. To ensure the safe operation of the city, meteorological departments need to provide forecast results for the Spring Festival travel rush weather service. Therefore, the extended-range forecast of winter rainfall is of considerable importance. To solve this problem, based on the analysis of low-frequency rainfall and the intra-seasonal oscillation of atmospheric circulation, an extended-range forecast model for winter rainfall is developed using spatiotemporal projection methods and is applied to a case study from 2020. The results show that: (1) The precipitation in the YRD during the winter has a significant intra-seasonal oscillation (ISO) with a periodicity of 10-30 d. (2) The atmospheric circulations associated with winter rainfall in the YRD have a significant characteristic of low-frequency oscillation. From a 30-day to a 0-day lead, large modifications appear in the low-frequency atmospheric circulations at low, mid, and high latitudes. At low latitudes, strong wet convective activity characterized by a negative OLR combined with a positive RH700 correlation coefficient moves northwestward and covers the entire YRD. Meanwhile, the Western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) characterized by a positive Z500 anomaly enhances and lifts northward. At mid and high latitudes, the signal of negatively correlated Z500 northwest of Lake Balkhash propagates southeastward, indicating the cold is air moving southward. Multiple circulation factors combine together and lead to the precipitation process in the YRD. (3) Taking the intra-seasonal dynamical evolution process of the atmospheric circulation as the prediction factor, the spatiotemporal method is used to build the model for winter mean extended-range precipitation anomaly tendency in the YRD. The hindcast for the recent 10 years shows that the ensemble model has a higher skill that can reach up to 20 days. In particular, the skill of the eastern part of the YRD can reach 25 days. (4) The rainfall in the 2019/2020 winter has a significant ISO. The ensemble model could forecast the most extreme precipitation for 20 days ahead.

J	Cronberg, G				Cronberg, G			Qualitative and quantitative investigations of phytoplankton in Lake Ringsjon, Scania, Sweden	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The algal record from Lake Ringsjon covers a period of more than 100 years. Towards the end of the 19th century, the lake had a well-functioning commercial fishery, when a brownish mess began to appear in the water, clogging-up the fishing nets and making fishing difficult. This was the first record of algal problems in the lake. Following complaints from the fishermen, the algal flora was investigated and the mess was stated to be a mass development of diatoms belonging to the genus Melosira ( Aulacoseira). Diatom maxima then appeared regularly in spring and autumn, whereas blue-green algae only occurred occasionally and in low abundances. Between 1900 and 1950, nutrient concentrations slowly increased in the lake. Algal blooms of Anabaena lemmermannii and Gloeotrichia echinulata began to appear in summer. Between 1960 and 1980, the lake developed into a hypertrophic status with extensive blooms of blue-green algae from May to October, including high biomasses of mainly Microcystis spp. This severe pollution started with increased usage of the lake, increased tourism and recreation, intensified farming with the introduction of artificial fertilization, and also the diversion of sewage water from a sewage treatment plant. In 1968, cattle death was reported and in 1981, algal toxicity was verified by mouse bioassay. After a period of extremely poor water quality, the lake began to show signs of improvement as a result of the nutrient and fish reduction programmes. The very heavy blooms of blue-green algae decreased and the duration of blooms became shorter. The Microcystis species were to a certain extent replaced by Anabaena and Aphanizomenon species, and biodiversity of algae increased. With respect to the algal community, the lake has improved considerably, but is still eutrophic and suffers summer blooms of toxic blue-green algae.																			0018-8158					JUN	1999	404						27	40		10.1023/A:1003757504155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003757504155													WOS:000083700800006

Nevertheless, the framework of the Holocene moisture variation and related mechanisms remain controversial, owing to complex hydroclimatic conditions triggered by the landform of the large mountain-arid basin. Here, we employed geochemical proxies from typical aeolian sand-palaeosol sequences in the Gonghe Basin, northeastern QTP, together with Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating, to reconstruct the pattern of effective moisture variation and associated mechanisms in this region. Our results indicate that the regional effective moisture was at its lowest until 9-8 ka, and approached a maximum during 8-4/3 ka of the middle Holocene. Afterwards, the climate became relatively dry in general, but with a transient humid interval around 2-1 ka. Our geochemical evidence indicates that the dry early Holocene probably can be attributed to a strong winter monsoon forced by remnant ice sheet, combined with the high evaporation caused by solar insolation. Also, shifts of humid-dry are closely linked to the Asian summer monsoonal strength and therefore the balance of evaporation-precipitation in the middle and late Holocene. Thus, the pattern of the Holocene effective moisture variation is characterized as the 'monsoon model' in a closed intermontane arid and semi-arid basin near the western Asian monsoonal limit.

In this study, we observed annual CH4 and CO2 fluxes, as well as CH4 and CO2 concentrations of water and ice-trapped bubbles in a peatland pond in the permafrost region of Northeast China. The results show that water CH4 and CO2 concentrations increased by 1-4 orders of magnitude during the ice cover period compared to the open water period. (CH4: 300.37 mu M vs. 0.014 mu M, CO2: 2915.73 mu M vs. 300.34 mu M). During the spring thaw period, water CH4 and CO2 concentrations decrease dramatically, with CH4 and CO2 fluxes reaching the highest values (CH4 flux: 30.01 mg m- 2 h- 1, CO2 flux: 401.88 mg m- 2 h- 1). High fluxes of CH4 and CO2 during the spring thaw period came not only from the release of CH4 and CO2 in water under the ice, but also from bubbles trapped in the ice. This study showed the importance of considering CH4 and CO2 storage during the ice cover period and spring thaw fluxes in boreal peatland ponds. Given that dynamics of CH4 and CO2 fluxes during the spring thaw period in peatland ponds remain understudied, we encourage an increased focus on observations of CH4 and CO2 fluxes dynamics during the spring thaw period. The lack of observation during the spring thaw period may underestimate the annual budget for CH4 and CO2 in peatland ponds.

Its pollen and loss-on-ignition analyses provide a Holocene vegetational, climatic, and environmental history of the lake catchment. Pollen analysis shows that: dense steppe dominated regional vegetation in the early Holocene (9,200-8,000 cal. yr BP); regional vegetation coverage gradually decreased in the middle Holocene (8,000-4,100 cal. yr BP); and marsh meadow grew on the lake edge and sparse steppe occupied the lake catchment after 4,100 cal. yr BP. Our result also reveals that: 9,200-8,000 cal. yr BP witnessed summer temperature, monsoonal rainfall, and lake-level maxima, as well as few winter and spring aeolian activities and frequent wildfires; 8,000-4,100 cal. yr BP saw a nonlinear decline in temperature, rainfall, lake level, and wildfires; and modern climatic and environmental conditions were established after 4,100 cal. yr BP. Three major monsoon-weakening events at ca. 6,700, 5,800, and 4,100 cal. yr BP were detected by pollen signals and proxies of the climate and environment.

The distribution of phosphatase activity among natural phytoplankton populations and its ecological significance is largely unknown. Bulk extracellular phosphatase activity of plankton (using a standard fluorometric assay) and expression of phosphatases at the level of single phytoplankton cells were studied in the eutrophic Rimov reservoir during three consecutive seasons. The new enzyme labelled fluorescence (ELF) technique was modified by introducing (i) fixation with HgCl2 to preserve fragile species and (ii) use of polycarbonate filters to concentrate the phytoplankton. After enzymatic hydrolysis of artificial substrate (ELF(R)97 phosphate), the fluorescent product (ELF(R)97 alcohol, ELFA) formed insoluble precipitates at the site of phosphatase activity. Inhibition experiments suggested that both the standard assay and the ELF technique detected the same group of phosphatases. Weak ELFA formation and/or stability at pH > 8 might prevent sufficient detection of alkaline phosphatases using the ELF technique. ELFA labelling was detected in most algal classes, except for Euglenophyceae and the majority of Cryptophyceae and Chrysophyceae. Surprisingly, phosphatase activity was almost absent in the dominant populations. No ELFA labelling occurred in the phytoplankton in early spring 2000 and during the clear-water phases in all sampling years. Species of Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyceae and Conjugatophyceae showed phosphatase activity mainly in summer and at the beginning of autumn, while one species of Chrysophyceae (Synura petersenii) and three diatoms (Aulacoseira italica, Cyclotella spp., and Stephanodiscus hantzschii) produced phosphatases in spring. Several green algae (Ankyra ancora, Ankyra judayi, Coelastrum pseudomicroporum, Eudorina elegans, and Pediastrum spp.) were ELFA-labelled whenever present in the phytoplankton. Some species produced the ectoenzyme only in one season, such as Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Cyanobacteria), Elakatothrix genevensis (Chlorophyceae), or Cryptomonas spp. On the other hand, one third of the 56 species studied never expressed any ELFA labelling. Large variability of phosphatase production was found not only among different algal species, but also within the population of one species. Not all cells of the population were equally ELFA-labelled and also the level of ELFA fluorescence was different. In particular cases, ELFA labelling on algal cells could be produced by bacterial rather than algal ectoenzymes. In comparison to standard methods, the ELF method provided more specific information about the variability of phosphatase activity (i.e. phosphorus stress) within the whole phytoplankton community as well as within one species populations.

J	BERG, DJ; GARTON, DW				BERG, DJ; GARTON, DW			SEASONAL ABUNDANCE OF THE EXOTIC PREDATORY CLADOCERAN, BYTHOTREPHES-CEDERSTROEMI, IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The predaceous cladoceran, Bythotrephes cederstroemi, has recently invaded the Great Lakes and basic information on its seasonal abundance and population demographic is lacking. Accordingly, we examined seasonal variation in abundance, length-weight relationships, fecundity, ontogeny of lateral spine production, sex ratio, and incidence of resting vs. subitaneous eggs. Seasonal variations in these parameters was compared with water temperature variation and the presence of a potential competitor, Leptodora kindti. Specimens for these analyses were collected with nocturnal surface tows in the western basin of Lake Erie during summer and fall, 1987. Bythotrephes did not appear until 23 July, had its maximum abundance (111 individuals/m3) at the surface on the night of 9 October, and persisted at lower numbers in samples through the last sampling date, 14 December. The correlation of body weight with tail spine length varies seasonally, with individuals weighing less in the summer than in the fall. Neonates possess one pair of lateral spines on the tail spine and add a pair during each of the first two molts, enabling determination of instar distribution. Females produce one to 12 subitaneous eggs per brood, with males and resting eggs occurring rarely. Bythotrephes abundance was negatively correlated with water temperature and Leptodora abundance, suggesting that Leptodora abundance or temperature, or both, affect the success of Bythotrephes in the western basin of Lake Erie.					; Berg, David/GQQ-2457-2022	Berg, David/0000-0002-2537-0759; 													0380-1330						1988	14	4					479	488		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71580-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71580-4													WOS:A1988R673900012

We studied planktonic and other algae, identified to genus, in three rivers in the Lake Eyre Basin. where summer-autumn floods typically occur on an annual basis. A moderately diverse algal flora was discovered with a total of 118 genera, containing at least 237 taxa, in seven phyla. Algal diversity was found to be highest during, or soon after flood events of varying sizes and in the summer following a large flood in the previous flood season. We suggest that the combination of germination of algae from channel and floodplain sediments and the transport of algae from aquatic refuges during flood events resulted in the observed increases in diversity. In addition, nutrient influxes associated with previous large floods, interact with the increase in temperature in the subsequent summer to provide optimum conditions for high algal production and, in some sites, high diversity. Multivariate analyses found that salinity was a significant driver of assemblage composition but only explained a small portion of the variance in generic richness. Within phyla, assemblage richness within the Chlorophyta and Euglenophyta showed a weak, but significant, negative correlation with increasing salinity, while in the Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta richness was not significantly correlated because both latter groups contained salt-tolerant taxa.

J	Piña-Ochoa, E; Alvarez-Cobelas, M				Pina-Ochoa, Elisa; Alvarez-Cobelas, Miguel			Seasonal nitrogen dynamics in a seepage lake receiving high nitrogen loads	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Studies on nitrogen dynamics in seepage lakes are seldom undertaken, yet our understanding of the complex pattern of the nitrogen (N) cycle is complicated by its temporal and spatial heterogeneity. This research investigated temporal variation in N concentration, considering different forms of N(NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, dissolved organic N, particulate organic N) in a Spanish flowthrough seepage lake (Colgada Lake) receiving high N loads. The study was based on monthly data collected over the period 2003-2005 from lake inputs and outputs, vertical profiles at a single representative site in the middle of the lake and fluxes of NH4+ and NO3- at the sediment - water interface. The distribution of total N (TN) inputs and outputs did not follow a clear temporal pattern. TN inputs varied from 27.70 to 125 tonnes N month(-1), 75-84% of which is NO3-. Temporal variation of concentration profiles for different N forms measured showed significant differences owing to stratification. Ammonium always entered the sediment, whereas sediments acted as either a sink or source of NO3-. Fluctuation in N dynamics in this lake was more influenced by external factors, such as the input variability, than by the turnover of nitrogenous substances in the water body. Comparing seasonal N dynamics, there seems to be temporal differences between seepage lakes and drainage lakes. In seepage lakes, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) peaks were reached in early spring and after overturn, whereas in drainage lakes, the autumn minimum gradually increased to maxima in late winter and during the stratification period.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2009	60	5					335	445		10.1071/MF08098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF08098													WOS:000266305500007

The size and structure of the pikeperch population is strongly influenced by their success at the juvenile stage. Therefore, we investigated the diet and prey selection of pikeperch fry caught in the ice-free period in lakes Peipsi and Vrtsjarv in 2007 and 2008. We analysed the stomach contents of 635 pikeperch from Lake Peipsi and 202 pikeperch from Lake Vrtsjarv, and compared our findings with similar data from the 1950s (Erm, About Biological and Morphological Differences of Pikeperch. Hydrobiological Researches II (in Estonian), 1961). Analysing 4-20 cm long fry, we studied differences in prey size, seasonal diet patterns and the ontogenetic diet shift. In both lakes, 0+ pikeperch feed mostly on large predatory zooplankters. However, in Lake Peipsi the stomach content weight and the average number of food items in stomach were higher, and the food spectrum was wider than in Lake Vrtsjarv. There was also a difference in the type of food that dominated fry's stomach content (calculated by weight) in the two lakes. In Lake Peipsi, chironomids larvae, as well as zooplankters Daphnia galeata and Bythotrephes longimanus dominated, while in Lake Vrtsjarv zooplankters Mesocyclops leuckarti and Leptodora kindti. Seasonal analysis showed that cladocerans dominated in pikeperch fry stomach content in summer and at the beginning of September, but copepods were dominant in autumn and spring. In contrast to the studies carried out from 1952 to 1958 (Erm, About Biological and Morphological Differences of Pikeperch. Hydrobiological Researches II (in Estonian), 1961), the shift from planktivory to piscivory at the end of the first growing season was hardly ever observed during our investigation. We believe this is due to the lack of suitable prey fish as there was a collapse of the smelt, Osmerus eperlanus (L.), population in both lakes. The transition of pikeperch from planktivory to piscivory was delayed till the next summer.

Abundance and habitat use of juvenile sunfish among different macrophyte stands	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Juvenile Lepomis sunfish (<75 mm total length, TL) density, plant stem density and invertebrate density were compared in the 3 most common habitats in the littoral zone of Cedar Lake, a Midwestern North American reservoir: nonvegetated areas, stands of the exotic macrophyte Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and stands of American pondweed (Potomogeton nodosus). Eurasian watermilfoil stands consistently had significantly higher stem density and invertebrate density than American pondweed stands. Juvenile sunfish densities were significantly higher in vegetated habitats than nonvegetated areas, but no significant differences were observed between the 2 vegetated habitats. Juvenile sunfish densities were initially higher in American pondweed stands than Eurasian watermilfoil stands, but fish density in American pondweed stands declined dramatically as water levels fell in autumn. Juvenile sunfish size structure was related to habitat type, with the smallest fish associated with Eurasian watermilfoil (38.2 mm TL), intermediate fish associated with American pondweed (43.1 mm TL), and the largest fish associated with nonvegetated habitats (51.2 mm TL). We suggest resource agencies should focus vegetation management efforts on eradicating Eurasian watermilfoil stands to provide foraging access for large mouth bass to improve their growth rate and reduce stunting of sunfish. However, management agencies must recognize that a healthy plant community below the depth of water level fluctuation may be the only source of cover for juvenile centrarchids during late summer in reservoirs prone to fluctuating water levels.

J	PIERSMA, T				PIERSMA, T			THE ANNUAL MOLT CYCLE OF GREAT CRESTED GREBES	ARDEA												This study analyses the moult patterns of all feather tracts of Great Crested Grebes throughout the non-breeding season. It is based on an examination of about 1000 carcasses of grebes which had accidentally drowned in fishing nets in Lake IJsselmeer, The Netherlands from August 1978 to December 1985. No differences were detected in the body moult schedules of adult males and females. From August through December, but not from January to March, first winter birds showed patterns which were slightly different from the adults. The moult of all feather tracts was very intensive in August-October. Most body feather tracts showed little moult in midwinter, but the flanks never stopped moulting. In late winter and early spring, only the head and neck showed a (second) peak in moult intensity (i.e. the acquirement of a summer plumage). A peculiar ''autumnal head plumage'' is described: a head plumage which looks like a pale adult breeding plumage with shorter crest and tippets, which consists of a different feather generation. The simultaneous moult of the flight feathers and, concurrently, the moult of the assembly of wing coverts, takes place in the period August-first half October, with much individual variation but no sexual differences in the timing of this moult. It was calculated that it takes an individual grebe about 17 days to complete the wing moult, which is less than was hitherto assumed. The upper wing coverts are moulted slightly earlier than the under wing coverts. In the discussion, the possible functional correlates of the moulting patterns and the biology of the grebes were explored. It is suggested that the maintenance of moulting flank feathers throughout the winter, is to provide the birds with a continuing resource of ingestible feathers, which may be an important digestive aid. A feather deposition rate (g feather mass/day) was calculated, to examine the annual changes in total moult intensity. Within a year, feather deposition rates vary with a factor 8.5. The highest values for the feather deposition rate (c. 0.85 g/day) are much like those reported for other species if body mass differences are taken into account. Grebes do not moult most heavily when thermal conditions are optimal, but a little later. This may relate to the extended breeding season of this species, or to a late built up of profitable fish stocks.

The coring sites are located in a proximal (AS10(prox)) and distal (AS10(dist)) position towards the main tributary River Ammer, in 1.8 km distance from each other. To shed light on sediment distribution within the lake, particular emphasis was (1) the detection of intercalated detrital layers and their micro-sedimentological features, and (2) intra-basin correlation of these event deposits. Detrital layers were dated by microscopic varve counting, verified by accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dating of terrestrial plant macrofossils. Since similar to 5500 varve years (vyr) BP, in total 1573 detrital layers were detected in either one or both of the investigated sediment profiles. Based on their microfacies, geochemistry, and proximal-distal deposition pattern, detrital layers were interpreted as River Ammer flood deposits. Earlier studies on flood layer seasonality have proven that flood layer deposition occurs predominantly during spring and summer, the flood season at Lake Ammersee. Most prominent features of the record are the onset of regular flood layer deposition at similar to 5500 vyr BP in AS10(prox) and similar to 2800 vyr BP in AS10(dist) as well as three major increases in mean flood layer thickness at similar to 5500, 2800, and 400 vyr BP. Integrating information from both sediment profiles allowed to interpret these changes in terms of shifts towards higher mean flood intensity. Proposed triggering mechanisms are gradual reduction in Northern Hemisphere orbital summer forcing and superimposed centennial-scale solar activity minima. Likely responses to this forcing are enhanced equator-to-pole temperature gradients and changes in synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation. The consequences for the Ammersee region are more intense cyclones leading to extremer rainfall and flood events in spring and summer. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study analyzed seasonal variation in the effect of water quality parameters on microbial community structure and function at southern Lake Taihu. We observed poor water quality in autumn (low dissolved oxygen concentration and water transparency) with severe eutrophication (high in nitrogen, phosphorus, and microcystins). Microcystins were a major indicator of water quality that affected total phosphorus and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Redundancy analysis revealed that total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrate, ammonium, and microcystins, temperature, and dissolved oxygen all significantly influenced the microbial community. Microbial co-occurrence networks revealed significant seasonal variations, with autumn and winter exhibiting a more complex structure than other seasons. Additionally, we identified microcystin-sensitive microbial species as eutrophication indicators; they are involved in bacterial community components and metabolic function and fluctuate under seasonal changes to water quality. In conclusion, our findings provide insight into the relationship between water quality and microbial communities, offering an empirical basis for improving the sustainable management of Lake Taihu.																				2073-4441				JUL 25	2025	17	15							2222	10.3390/w17152222	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17152222													WOS:001548706300001

A clear seasonal alternation of Endochironomus albipennis larvae between submerged plants and the bottom sediment was observed in the littoral of a deep mesotrophic and a shallow eutrophic lake. The analysis of change in larval density and of occurrence of pupae suggests that larvae migrated from plants to the bottom sediment in early autumn and back to the plants, where they pupate, in spring. 2. Up to 95% of the third and fourth instar larvae overwintered in the bottom sediment in special cocoons. Larvae staying in the sediment without cocoons were also dormant. The timing of cocoon formation was different in the two lakes. 3.

J	VANEVERDINGEN, RO				VANEVERDINGEN, RO			PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ASPECTS OF CANADIAN SPRINGS	MEMOIRS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF CANADA												Springs, or points of natural, concentrated groundwater discharge, may be located in river or lake beds, or below mean sea level along the coast, but many are found some distance from surface-water bodies. Spring water commonly represents rain or snowmelt that has entered the ground at a higher elevation a number of years earlier. Measured springwater temperatures in Canada range from very cold (-2.9-degrees-C) to hot (82.2-degrees-C). Thermal spring waters, with temperatures above the local mean-annual air temperature, have undergone geothermal heating during deep subsurface circulation in areas of high topographic relief. Hot springs (> 37-degrees-C) are therefore found only in mountainous areas, in Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. Spring locations are commonly controlled by major folding or faulting, or both, in the bedrock strata. Reported pH values in Canadian spring waters range from strongly acidic to alkaline (2.8 to > 10.0). Low pH values (< 4.0) are associated with high contents of dissolved Fe (up to 2600 mg.L-1) and other heavy metals (e.g. Zn up to 177 mg.L-1), resulting from the oxidation of metal sulfides. Measured redox potentials (Eh) range from -252 to +683 mV. Negative Eh values are found in spring waters that contain dissolved H2S and S2-, produced by bacterial reduction of dissolved sulfate. Total-dissolved-solids contents of Canadian spring waters are reported to range from as little as 32 to over 75 000 mg.L-1. Chemical composition also varies widely. Major anions include bicarbonate (up to 5960 mg.L-1), sulfate (up to 17 520 mg.L-1), and chloride (up to 44 300 mg.L-1). Major cations include calcium (up to 1823 mg.L-1), magnesium (up to 1190 mg.L-1), sodium (up to 27 100 mg.L-1, and potassium (up to 1568 mg.L-1). The chemical composition of each spring water reflects the mineral composition of the rock types with which the water has been in contact, as well as its subsurface residence time. In simplified terms, Ca-Mg/HCO3 waters come from carbonate rock (limestone, dolomite), Ca/SO4 waters from gypsum or anhydrite, and Na/Cl waters from salt beds. Springwater temperature and composition can both show gradual (seasonal) and sudden (incidental) variations. In springs that show seasonal variations, maximum temperature and mineralization occur near the end of winter; minimum values commonly occur during snowmelt. Sudden variations in temperature, mineralization, and discharge rate can occur during periods of heavy rain, if cold, non-mineralized rainwater enters spring conduits. Earthquakes may cause sudden changes in discharge rates and suspended-solids contents, without affecting water temperature or chemical composition. Information on Canadian spring locations, and on their physical and chemical character, is still spotty. As detailed knowledge about springs can be useful in both ecological and water-supply studies, an effort should be made to expand and refine the existing database.																			0071-075X					SUM	1991		155					7	28																WOS:A1991FU07100002

These lakes are sources of methane to the atmosphere although the methane flux is restricted by an ice cover for most of the year. How methane concentrations and fluxes in these waters are affected by the presence of an ice cover is poorly understood. To relate water body morphology, ice formation and methane to each other, we studied the ice of three different water bodies in locations typical of the transition of permafrost from land to ocean in a continuous permafrost coastal region in Siberia. In total, 11 ice cores were analyzed as records of the freezing process and methane composition during the winter season. The three water bodies differed in terms of connectivity to the sea, which affected fall freezing. The first was a bay underlain by submarine permafrost (Tiksi Bay, BY), the second a shallow thermokarst lagoon cut off from the sea in winter (Polar Fox Lagoon, LG) and the third a land-locked freshwater thermokarst lake (Goltsovoye Lake, LK). Ice on all water bodies was mostly methane-supersaturated with respect to atmospheric equilibrium concentration, except for three cores from the isolated lake. In the isolated thermokarst lake, ebullition from actively thawing basin slopes resulted in the localized integration of methane into winter ice. Stable delta C-13(CH4) isotope signatures indicated that methane in the lagoon ice was oxidized to concentrations close to or below the calculated atmospheric equilibrium concentration. Increasing salinity during winter freezing led to a micro-environment on the lower ice surface where methane oxidation occurred and the lagoon ice functioned as a methane sink. In contrast, the ice of the coastal marine environment was slightly supersaturated with methane, consistent with the brackish water below. Our interdisciplinary process study shows how water body morphology affects ice formation which mitigates methane fluxes to the atmosphere.					; Grosse, Guido/F-5018-2011; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Overduin, Paul/B-3258-2017; Liebner, Susanne/R-3749-2019; Biskaborn, Boris K./D-2419-2011; Angelopoulos, Michael/CAH-1518-2022; Overduin, Pier/B-3258-2017; Biskaborn, Boris/D-2419-2011	Angelopoulos, Michael/0000-0003-2574-5108; Grosse, Guido/0000-0001-5895-2141; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Biskaborn, Boris K./0000-0003-2378-0348; Bussmann, Ingeborg/0000-0002-1197-7461; Overduin, Pier/0000-0001-9849-4712; Damm, Ellen/0000-0002-1487-1283; Liebner, Susanne/0000-0002-9389-7093; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				APR 1	2021	15	3					1607	1625		10.5194/tc-15-1607-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-15-1607-2021													WOS:000636635600002

Variability of Composition of Microbiota of Gastrointestinal Tract of Perch Perca fluviatilis and Prussian Carp Carassius gibelio During the Vegetative Season	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												The composition of the microbiota of the digestive tract of two fish species differing in feeding habits-perch Perca fluviatilis and Prussian carp Carassius gibelio from Malye Chany Lake (West Siberia) was studied by sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq platform. During the vegetative season, the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota of the studied species had varied with the highest diversity of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of perch in spring, while in the intestine of Prussian carp in spring and autumn. The perch gastrointestinal microbiota was dominated by Sediminibacterium, unclassified and uncultivated Chitinophagaceae, Sphingomonas, Caulobacter, Phyllobacterium, Haematospirillum, Cetobacterium, Vibrio, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas; in Prussian carp, Sediminibacterium, unclassified Vibrionaceae and Chitinophagaceae, Sphingomonas, Caulobacter, Vibrio and Aeromonas. It is assumed that changes in the composition of microbial communities during the vegetative season are associated with the seasonal changes in water temperature and food resources of the lake.					; Baturina, Olga/AAT-5191-2021; Galina, Izvekova/HOH-8980-2023; Simonov, Evgeniy/F-7698-2012; , Izvekova/H-7434-2015; Solovyev, Mikhail/U-2328-2017; Kashinskaya, Elena/E-8769-2017	Kashinskaya, Elena/0000-0001-8097-2333; , Izvekova/0000-0003-3272-9763; Solovyev, Mikhail/0000-0001-5373-8509; Simonov, Evgeniy/0000-0003-0194-4487; 													0032-9452	1555-6425				NOV	2021	61	6					955	971		10.1134/S0032945221060060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0032945221060060													WOS:000742700400013

Greece) after agricultural land use changes in the lake's drainage basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A monitoring study of pesticides belonging to different chemical families was carried out in Amvrakia lake (West Greece) waters after land use changes in the lake's basin. Based on land-use patterns, nine sampling points were selected. Pesticides were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) using Oasis HLB cartridges and analysed by gas chromatographic techniques with flame thermionic and mass-spectra detection. Pesticides detected during the monitoring survey include eight herbicides (alachlor, atrazine, s-metolachlor, pendimethalin, prometryne, propachlor, simazine, trifluralin) and one metabolite (deethyl atrazine) with concentration levels up to 807ngL(1) (recorded for alachlor), eight insecticides (azinphos methyl, chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos methyl, diazinon, dimethoate, fenitrothion, malathion, methidathion) with concentration levels up to 490ngL(1) (recorded for azinphos methyl) and six fungicides (benalaxyl, cyproconazole, fenarimol, pyrimethanil, triadimefon, triadimenol) with concentration levels up to 408ngL(1) (recorded for pyrimethanil). More frequently detected pesticides were atrazine, deethyl atrazine, alachlor, azinphos methyl, chlorpyrifos methyl, diazinon and pyrimethanil. The higher concentrations were measured during spring-early summer period, following seasonal application of pesticides and diminished significantly during winter. Littoral sampling stations presented higher pesticide concentration levels and more frequent detection. Aquatic risk assessment was based on the Risk Quotient (RQ=MEC/PNEC) deterministic method regarding three trophic levels: algae, aquatic invertebrates and fish. Non-acceptable risk for 10 compounds was observed when maximum concentrations were used. Compliance to EC environmental quality standards is also discussed.					; Hela, Dimitra/AAN-6579-2021; Zacharias, Ierotheos/R-9672-2017; Konstantinou, Ioannis/AAN-6223-2021	KONSTANTINOU, IOANNIS/0000-0003-0352-4988; Zacharias, Ierotheos/0000-0001-8410-6862; Thomatou, Anna-Akrivi/0000-0002-6812-0186; 													0306-7319	1029-0397				JUN 1	2013	93	7					780	799		10.1080/03067319.2012.656099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2012.656099													WOS:000319377500006

Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation in Drinking Water Source Protection in Ontario: Challenges and Opportunities	CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IN DEVELOPED NATIONS: FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE	Advances in Global Change Research											Climate change will create numerous challenges for water managers. In Ontario, many parts of the province will experience decreased runoff and groundwater recharge, reduced lake levels, and more extreme precipitation events. Shift in patterns of precipitation also are expected, with more falling as rain rather than snow in winter, and with summers being drier. For water managers, the implications are serious. At the most basic level, long-term plans and investments that assume that future hydrological conditions in future will be the same as those of the past simply are not sensible. How can water managers at the local level, who already face considerable challenges in dealing with current climatic variability, adjust to this new reality? This chapter argues for adaptation through mainstreaming, in other words, building adaptation to climate change into existing decision-making and planning processes. Ongoing efforts to protect drinking water sources across Ontario currently afford the best opportunity to mainstream climate change into an existing water-related planning process. The chapter identifies challenges and opportunities for accomplishing this goal.																			1574-0919		978-94-007-0566-1				2011	42						439	448		10.1007/978-94-007-0567-8_32	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-0567-8_32	10.1007/978-94-007-0567-8												WOS:000293761100032

Evaporation and energy budget in lake vegoritis, Greece	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Evaporation is one of the main components in both the energy and water budgets of lakes and a primary process of water loss for most of them. A one-dimensional, eddy diffusion model of lake's water temperature distribution is used to evaluate daily evaporation values as a residual of the energy budget in Lake Vegoritis in Northern Greece and for the year of 1993. Lake Vegoritis has been under a continuous deficit in the water balance for up to three decades. The water temperature model, calibrated with measured values from two different years, is used reversely to evaluate the evaporation through the energy budget. The equilibrium temperature approach for the surface boundary condition is used in the model, as well as the simplification of Bowen ratio in the energy budget. Evaporation values estimated by the model are used for determining a mass transfer-based evaporation equation for Lake Vegoritis. Estimated evaporation rates show a characteristic annual cycle with tow values at spring and the highest values at summer. The energy stored in the lake at spring and early summer is released to the environment later in the year as sensible and mainly as latent heat. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	MCCOMBIE, AM				MCCOMBIE, AM			THERMAL REGIME SOUTH BAY MANITOULIN ISLAND	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The thermal regime of South Bay is described from records collected from 1953 to 1962 with thermometers, thermographs, and bathythermographs, the last being cast at 11 stations along the bay and one in Lake Kuron. Warming begins in April and thermal stratification is established in June. Shallow areas warm more rapidly than deep in the spring and cool more quickly in autumn. The boundary between the epilimnlon and the thermocline becomes sharper as summer advances but the transition from thermocline to hypolimnion remains gradual. The average trend of surface temperatures is a sine function with a maximum of 66 F in mid Aug. and a minimum of 34 F in late March, though values outside this range occur frequently. At 180 ft the maximum of 47F is attained in Nov. At the lake and outermost bay stations there is a temperature slump in June and July which may be due to an upwelling in the lake. Evidence of an exchange of water between the lake and bay is seen in vertical temperature sections and water movements. Variations in epilimnial temperatures are correlated with those of the air temperature, but variations in epiliminal and hypoliminal temperatures appear to be unrelated. Finally, literature describing the influence of temperature on the year class strength of smallmouth bass, the distribution of lake trout, the growth of yellow perch, and the life history of Pontoporeia in South Bay is reviewed.																									1967	24	1					101	+		10.1139/f67-010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f67-010													WOS:A19679137600010

Florida largemouth bass had a higher mean swimming speed than northern largemouth bass (4.41 cm/sec versus 3.75 cm/sec, respectively). Florida largemouth bass were more active at dawn; northern largemouth bass activity peaked in the afternoon. Mean swimming speed was least in mid-summer.

Sedimentology and stratigraphy of a modern halite sequence formed under Dead Sea level fall	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Halite sequences in the geological record accumulated in deep hypersaline basins. However, such halite sequences are interpreted based on modern analogues of halite deposition in shallow hypersaline environments. Recently, halite deposition in the deep, hypersaline Dead Sea has been studied together with its coeval environmental and limnogeological forcing. This is the closest modern analogue for deep environments. Therefore, stratigraphy, sedimentology and petrography of a well-dated, high-resolution modern Dead Sea halite sequence are explored. The sequence was deposited during a ca 30 m lake-level decline since the onset of modern halite deposition in 1980, and was compared with sub-annual lake levels, precipitation and flood records. The sedimentology of the sequence documents the trend of shallowing water depth, including individual floods. The sequence base is composed of alternating bottom growth-cumulate halite annual couplets, typical of deep hypolimnetic water deposition. Up-sequence, the annual couplets disappear and towards its top are composed of cumulate layers with dissolution features, typical of shallow epilimnetic water deposition. Halite deposition rate is reduced by 60% at the shallow lakefloor compared with the deep lakefloor, mainly due to the summer undersaturation that leads to depocentre 'halite focusing'. The top of the sequence contains shoreline deposits, halolites (halite ooids) and polygonal surface cracks, indicating subaerial exposure. This study shows petrographic indicators for summer thermal dissolution (partially dissolved crystals), which are distinct from dissolution features by winter floods that generate a regional truncation surface. Spatial variations in halite thickness and facies, indicating much thinner and spatially limited halite units compared to modelled halite units based on mass balance considerations were also observed. These observations provide criteria for: (i) recognizing water depths and shallowing lake-level trends from halite sequences throughout the geological record; and (ii) interpreting palaeolimnology, water column structure and the relations between stratigraphic horizons and corresponding shorelines.					; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021; Enzel, Yehouda/AAV-5829-2021	Lowenstein, Tim K./0000-0003-2828-7341; MOR, ZIV/0000-0003-2756-6293; Eyal, Haggai/0000-0001-5704-9292; Sirota, Ido/0000-0001-5014-4369; Ben Moshe, Liran/0000-0002-7600-8821; , Nadav/0000-0002-4726-1668													0037-0746	1365-3091				APR	2021	68	3					1069	1090		10.1111/sed.12814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12814		NOV 2020											WOS:000593384800001

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Advancement of phytoplankton peaks has been reported from a large variety of aquatic systems, attributed mostly to climate warming. Most studies have used chlorophyll a as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Here, we investigated phenology of three phytoplankton taxa (Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira spp. and Cryptomonas spp.) in four lakes of the English Lake District situated within the same catchment over a 58-year period (19452003). 2. We used two methods (the centre of gravity method and a fitted Weibull-type function) to quantify the timing of the spring bloom. Both methods gave similar results for the diatoms, but not for Cryptomonas spp.. 3. The timing of the spring bloom advanced over the study period for A. formosa but was delayed for Aulacoseira spp. and Cryptomonas spp.. These changes were consistent in all four lakes. 4. We tested whether surface water temperatures prior to the time of phytoplankton peak abundance, winter soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and silicate concentrations, winter taxon inoculum, Schmidt stability or a combination of these affected phytoplankton phenology in the four lakes. Results were remarkably consistent: each driver either advanced or delayed the peak of each taxon in all four lakes. However, the different drivers affected the taxa differently. 5. Contrary to our expectations, the regional driver, temperature, did not have a consis-tent effect on the three phytoplankton taxa, significantly advancing A. formosa and Aulacoseira spp. in the North Basin of Windermere but significantly delaying Cryptomonas spp. peaks in three lakes. Overall, the locally variable driver, SRP concentration, had a more consistent effect upon phenology, affecting all taxa in nearly all lakes.

Specific somatic energy content varied between 4.3 and 6.1 kJ.g(-1) in spawners and between 4.8 and 6.6 kJ.g(-1) in immatures. Corresponding values for specific somatic lipid energy were 0.5-1.6 kJ.g(-1) for spawners and 0.7-2.1 kJ.g(-1) for immatures. The temporal pattern in storage energy residuals (deviation from mean storage energy, all sampling periods pooled) indicated that total, protein and lipid energy accumulated in the autumn and early winter. This increase was followed by a winter decrease in somatic energy (January to April). A new increase in total somatic energy and somatic lipid energy occurred during late winter (March/April to June), while the lake was still ice covered and water temperatures ranged between 0.5 and 2.5degreesC. The observed seasonal pattern of specific energy storage and lipid deposition demonstrated a considerable potential for energy accumulation in Arctic char at low temperatures. It is discussed whether freshwater lakes at high altitudes or latitudes represent a temperature-stabilised and predictable environment in contrast to the variable temperature experienced in the corresponding terrestrial system.

We hypothesized that increased human activity in summer would affect the trophic state of downstream reservoirs, affecting the interannual species composition of rotifers. We used long-term data for the Unmun Reservoir in South Korea (2009-2015), which is increasingly affected by human activity. The interannual variation of nitrogen and phosphorus levels was higher in summer and autumn, resulting in eutrophication. This led to a change in species composition of rotifers. Anuroeopsts fissa, Brachionus calyciflorus and Trichocerca gracilis were abundant in the most eutrophic state, while high densities of Ascomorpha ovalis and Ploesoma hudsoni were observed when nutrient concentrations were lower. The trophic state changes in the Unmun Reservoir were largely attributed to summer human activity in tributary streams. Our study location is typical of the stream network in South Korea and we assume that similar trophic state changes in reservoirs will be common. Changes in the density and species diversity of rotifers due to eutrophication indicate the need for active management and conservation, including the restriction of human activity around streams.

Excess loading of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) triggers a shift in the trophic structure of shallow lakes from a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated state to an algal-dominated turbid state. However, the role of N in the shift is debated, and experimental evidence is, with a few exceptions, based on short-term studies (days to a few months). 2. We studied the effect of N loading on macrophytes (dominated by Potamogeton lucens and Ca-bomba caroliniana), periphyton, filamentous algae and phytoplankton in mesocosms over 10 months (starting in October) in subtropical China (Wuhan). There were three N treatments: controls (CN) without nitrogen addition (mean TN = 1.9 mg L-1), low nitrogen (LN) addition (mean TN = 3.5 mg L-1) and high nitrogen (HN) addition (mean TN = 5.5 mg L-1). Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the water column remained moderate (0.05-0.07 mg L-1) during the experiment in all treatments. 3. Macrophyte abundance declined in the LN and HN treatments in the first 6 months, but not in controls, followed by a partial recovery in the LN treatments. They disappeared completely in the HN treatments the following summer. Periphyton (biofilm on plastic) and phytoplankton biomass remained unaffected during the first 6 months but increased over the summer by two or three times, compared with controls, in low and high nitrogen treatments, respectively. By contrast, the abundance of filamentous algae increased over winter but declined during the summer with no obvious relationship to the N treatments. There was no difference in the TN or nitrate concentrations or soluble protein, soluble sugar and Chl-a content of P. lucens leaves and stems with increasing N load. 4. Macrophyte populations are partially resilient to abrupt increases in N loading at moderate TP concentrations, but, after prolonged exposure, a complete collapse occurs. Our results further indicate that macrophyte loss is exacerbated by shading by filamentous algae during the winter, and by phytoplankton and periphyton in the summer, while there was no indication of direct N toxicity.

Controls on the seasonal and interannual dynamics of organic matter stable carbon isotopes in mesotrophic Lake Holzmaar, Germany	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We investigated the particulate organic matter (POM) flux and its stable carbon isotope composition in response to changes in phytoplankton primary production and abiotic environmental affects in mesotrophic Lake Holzmaar. POM fluxes were determined by sediment traps emptied biweekly from 1995 to 2004. Water chemical measurements and meteorological observations were done concurrently. POM fluxes within and directly below the lake's epilimnion were relatively low during winter (<0.5 g m(-2) d(-1)) and increased to 1.0-1.5 g m(-2) d(-1) during summer months because of enlarged phytoplankton production. In contrast, in the lake's hypolimnion a much higher POM flux was observed during winter as result of resuspension of particulate material from the lake's bottom. C:N (weight, total organic carbon : total nitrogen) ratios of settling organic matter vary around 8 at all three depths, indicating a predominant phytoplankton origin of POM. The annual epilimnic POM flux correlates with the epilimnic phosphate concentration early in the seasonal cycle, indicating that the supply of phosphate is the major control on the amount of algal biomass. A recurrent annual oscillation of the stable carbon isotope composition of POM with low delta(13)C values during winter and more positive values during summer is interpreted as the result of phytoplankton primary production. A close delta(13)C(POM)-POM flux relationship was observed, testifying to the primary dependence of delta(13)C(POM) on lacustrine primary production. Contrary to POM flux, the epilimnic delta(13)C(POM) signal is transferred to the lakes bottom notwithstanding sediment resuspension and microbial alteration. Our results demonstrate that sedimentary stable carbon isotopes are a valuable proxy for lacustrine paleo-productivity in Lake Holzmaar.

Nutrient fluxes across reaches and impoundments in two southeastern Michigan watersheds	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Bosch, N.S., T.H. Johengen, J.D. Allan and G.W. Kling. 2009. Nutrient fluxes across reaches and impoundments in two southeastern Michigan watersheds. Lake Reserv. Manage. 25:389-400. River systems with impoundments are expected to experience greater nutrient removal as a consequence of enhanced nitrogen (N) loss by denitrification, settling and burial of phosphorus (P), and longer residence times of water relative to a free-flowing river. We evaluated the magnitude of N and P removal across stream reaches and impoundments, including annual and seasonal trends, in two southeastern Michigan rivers that differ in their degree of impoundment and watershed land use patterns. All nutrient fraction concentrations remained statistically unchanged across stream reaches of 2-3 km in length, but dissolved oxygen and pH increased. Impoundment outlets exhibited increases in water temperature and decreases in conductivity, TP, TN, TDP, SRP, TDN, and NO3-N relative to inflowing water. A nutrient load mass balance showed that two connected impoundments removed 18 and 32% of the annual river loads of TN and TP, respectively. Removal rates were seasonably variable, with TP removal most pronounced during winter months when the impoundment received episodic high P loads. Conversely, TN removal was greatest during summer and autumn months when impoundments were stratified and water temperatures were elevated. Strong seasonal differences in N and P transport through the impoundments demonstrated the capacity of impoundments to dramatically alter the timing and stoichiometry of downstream nutrient export. These seasonal differences also highlight the need to consider the entire annual cycle when estimating surface water nutrient dynamics or designing management plans for nutrient abatement.

J	Harding, JN; Reynolds, JD				Harding, Jennifer N.; Reynolds, John D.			Opposing forces: Evaluating multiple ecological roles of Pacific salmon in coastal stream ecosystems	ECOSPHERE												Resource flows and disturbance from species migrations can alter the productivity, structure and function of an ecosystem. Annual mass migrations of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to coastal watersheds import vast quantities of potentially limiting nutrients that have been shown to increase primary and secondary productivity in streams and lakes. Substrate disturbance during spawning can also export nutrients and reduce primary and secondary production. Here we study the impacts of these dual roles of salmon on stream invertebrates. We collected benthic macroinvertebrates in 15 streams prior to and following peak salmon spawning on British Columbia's central coast. Along with other habitat measurements including stream water chemistry, temperature, and watershed size, we investigated the effects of salmon on invertebrate delta N-15, delta C-13 and biomass density (mg/m(2)) among 15 streams and within 5 streams, upstream and downstream of barriers to spawning salmon. We found that stream invertebrates assimilate salmon-derived nutrients in proportion to availability but invertebrate biomass density declines in both seasons with increasing salmon density. Benthic disturbance appears to be the cause of this decline in the fall, but the decline in the spring may be due to the slow recovery of invertebrates from substrate disturbance the previous fall or salmon nutrients may be indirectly driving declines in spring invertebrate biomass by subsidizing other trophic levels and eliciting a trophic cascade.

Although Se exposure occurs primarily via diet, considerable uncertainty lies in modeling Se transfer and bioaccumulation from sediment, detritus, and/or periphyton through benthic macroinvertebrates (BMI) to fish. Here we estimated Se concentrations in four coldwater fish species (northern pike, white sucker, lake whitefish, and ninespine stickleback) inhabiting boreal lakes downstream from a uranium mill in northern Canada. In addition, we evaluated the potential effects of BMI and periphyton sampling methods (artificial substrates vs. grab samples), seasons (summer vs. winter), and models (USEPA vs. Assessment of the Dispersion and Effects of Parameter Transport) on the estimated Se concentrations in fish tissue. Results were compared with site-specific benchmarks and observed Se concentrations in resident fish. In summer 2019, periphyton and BMI were sampled at 10 sampling stations (two in Vulture Lake and eight in McClean Lake) using artificial substrates (n=4) and sediment grab samples (n=3). In winter 2021, samples were collected in McClean Lake (n=3) through ice holes using a sediment grab sampler. Estimated Se concentrations in fish tissue depended on the surface sediment or periphyton Se concentrations used in the models. At Vulture Lake, Se concentrations in northern pike muscle estimated using the grab sample data (17.3 +/- 11.5 mu g/g DW), but not the artificial substrates (34.5 +/- 1.2 mu g/g DW), were comparable with the observed mean concentration (19.0 +/- 1.4 mu g/g DW) in this species. At McClean Lake, Se body burdens in forage fish estimated using data from both sampling methods were comparable with measured data. Significantly lower mean whole-body Se concentrations were estimated for all fish species in winter (1.0 +/- 0.3 mu g/g DW) relative to summer (4.8 +/- 1.6 mu g/g DW). Further investigation is necessary to understand how potential seasonal shifts in dietary Se exposure relate to fish reproduction and early life stages.

This study simultaneously investigated the seasonal variation characteristics of P and W in sediments in Meiliang Bay, China. The results indicated that seasonal variations in pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature (T) at the sediment-water interface influenced the P and W composition as well as their release from sediments. The diffusion fluxes of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and soluble W (except in winter) were 0.145-2.881 mg center dot m-2 center dot d-1 and 1.785-3.006 mu g center dot m-2 center dot d-1, respectively, indicating that the sediments served as a source of P and W. In autumn, the diffusion fluxes of SRP (2.881 mg center dot m-2 center dot d-1) and soluble W (3.006 mu g center dot m-2 center dot d-1) were significantly higher than in winter (0.147 mg center dot m-2 center dot d-1 and-0.048 mu g center dot m-2 center dot d-1, respectively). The concentration of SRP and soluble W in winter (0.20 mg center dot L-1 and 0.22 mu g center dot L-1, respectively) were significantly lower than in autumn (1.57 mg center dot L-1 and 1.39 mu g center dot L-1, respectively). These results suggest that under high temperatures and cyanobacteria degradation, sediments release more SRP, soluble W, Fe(II), Mn, and dissolved organic matter (DOM). The significant positive correlations among SRP, soluble W, Fe, Mn, and DOM and their consistent trends in the top 20 mm of the sediment indicate that the main processes causing the release of P and W from sediments are competitive adsorption by DOM and redox reactions of Fe (III)/Mn (IV) oxyhydroxides. This study is of great practical significance for simultaneously addressing lake eutrophication and heavy metal pollution.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 15	2025	383								126746	10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2025.126746		JUL 2025						40623587					WOS:001537499100001

Meteotsunamis in the Laurentian Great Lakes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The generation mechanism of meteotsunamis, which are meteorologically induced water waves with spatial/ temporal characteristics and behavior similar to seismic tsunamis, is poorly understood. We quantify meteotsunamis in terms of seasonality, causes, and occurrence frequency through the analysis of long-term water level records in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The majority of the observed meteotsunamis happen from late-spring to mid-summer and are associated primarily with convective storms. Meteotsunami events of potentially dangerous magnitude (height > 0.3 m) occur an average of 106 times per year throughout the region. These results reveal that meteotsunamis are much more frequent than follow from historic anecdotal reports. Future climate scenarios over the United States show a likely increase in the number of days favorable to severe convective storm formation over the Great Lakes, particularly in the spring season. This would suggest that the convectively associated meteotsunamis in these regions may experience an increase in occurrence frequency or a temporal shift in occurrence to earlier in the warm season. To date, meteotsunamis in the area of the Great Lakes have been an overlooked hazard.					; Anderson, Eric/JYO-8924-2024; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012; Wu, Chin/C-2042-2009; Rabinovich, Alexander/ABD-5745-2020	Kristovich, David/0000-0001-9381-1053; Wu, Chin/0000-0001-8393-1940; Bechle, Adam/0000-0001-9335-2344; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383													2045-2322					NOV 24	2016	6									10.1038/srep37832	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep37832								27883066					WOS:000392069300001

To determine if a corresponding amelioration of stream acidity has occurred, we analyzed trends in anthropogenically driven episodic acidification in five streams during the same time period, using the Boreal Dilution Model (BDM) (Bishop, K. H.; Laudon, H.; Kohler, S. Water Resour. Res. 2000, 36, 1873-1884). Although there was no significant change in the annual average streamwater chemistry, the anthropogenic ally driven episodic acidification associated with spring flood runoff decreased by between 40% and 80%. A strong correlation between winter SO42- deposition and the anthropogenic component of episodic acidification in these five streams suggests that future reductions of acid deposition will further improve the spring flood acidification situation in northern Sweden. These results argue that reduced emissions of acid precursors have generated significant improvements in the surface water chemistry during episodes associated with spring runoff in northern Sweden.

High-frequency sensor data capture short-term variability in Fe and Mn concentrations due to hypolimnetic oxygenation and seasonal dynamics in a drinking water reservoir	WATER RESEARCH												The biogeochemical cycles of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in lakes and reservoirs have predictable seasonal trends, largely governed by stratification dynamics and redox conditions in the hypolimnion. However, shortterm (i.e., sub-weekly) trends in Fe and Mn cycling are less well-understood, as most monitoring efforts focus on longer-term (i.e., monthly to yearly) time scales. The potential for elevated Fe and Mn to degrade water quality and impact ecosystem functioning, coupled with increasing evidence for high spatiotemporal variability in other biogeochemical cycles, necessitates a closer evaluation of the short-term Fe and Mn dynamics in lakes and reservoirs. We adapted a UV-visible spectrophotometer coupled with a multiplexor pumping system and partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling to generate high spatiotemporal resolution predictions of Fe and Mn concentrations in a drinking water reservoir (Falling Creek Reservoir, Vinton, VA, USA) equipped with a hypolimnetic oxygenation (HOx) system. We quantified hourly Fe and Mn concentrations during two transitional periods: reservoir turnover (Fall 2020) and HOx initiation (Summer 2021). Our sensor system successfully predicted mean Fe and Mn concentrations and trends, ground-truthed by grab sampling and laboratory analysis. During fall turnover, hypolimnetic Fe and Mn concentrations began to decrease more than two weeks before complete mixing of the reservoir, with rapid equalization of epilimnetic and hypolimnetic Fe and Mn concentrations in less than 48 h after full water column mixing. During the initiation of HOx in Summer 2021, Fe and Mn displayed distinctly different responses to oxygenation, as indicated by the rapid oxidation of soluble Fe but not soluble Mn. This study demonstrates that Fe and Mn concentrations are sensitive to changes in redox conditions induced by stratification and oxygenation, although their responses to these changes differ. We also show that high spatio-temporal resolution predictions of Fe and Mn can improve drinking water monitoring programs and reservoir management practices.

Of 265 surface water samples, 9 (3.4%) were HAV-positive. HAVs were mainly detected in the summer (3/62, 4.8%) and spring (4/96, 4.2%) seasons. Comparing different water sources, the highest prevalence (6.6%) of positive samples was seen in lake water, four HAV-positive samples being from lakes. Comparing prevalence rates across the four representative Korean basin systems, no HAVs were found in the Han or Nakdong river basins. The highest HAV prevalence was found in samples from the Yeongsan river and other basins (6.3%); the Geum/Seom river was also found to have a high HAV prevalence (5.7%).

Diet composition and overlap in a mixed warm- and coldwater fish community	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												In Twin Lakes, Washington, illegal introductions of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) are feared to be impacting economically important rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations. We evaluated the stomach contents of 69 golden shiner, 146 rainbow trout, 83 brook trout, and 561 largernouth bass during summer stratification in 2004 and 2005, to determine community diet composition and overlap when food resources were partitioned thermally and spatially. Gut content data revealed some diet overlap but also illustrated distinct resource partitioning among all species but not between salmonids. Rainbow and brook trout had similar pelagic based diets of zooplankton and chaoborids, with high estimated diet overlap. Largemouth bass >= 300 mm was piscivorous and consumed principally golden shiner, with some consumption of rainbow and brook trout during late spring and early fall. Largemouth bass <= 299 mm primarily consumed benthic invertebrates in littoral macrophyte beds. Golden shiner diet contained both littoral and pelagic items, consisting of algae, benthic invertebrates, and zooplankton. Preferential differences in temperature, dissolved oxygen, and habitat as well as species size and ontogeny may all contribute to resource partitioning in the Twin Lakes.

However, there were still significant numbers of deformed chironomids. The incidence of deformity increased in summer in larvae from all sites except Hamurana Stream. No seasonal differences were observed in larvae from Hamurana Stream.

J	MARKAGER, S; HANSEN, B; SONDERGAARD, M				MARKAGER, S; HANSEN, B; SONDERGAARD, M			PELAGIC CARBON METABOLISM IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE DURING A CLEAR-WATER PHASE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC, respectively), primary production, bacterial production, bacterial carbon demand and community grazing were measured for 9 weeks in eutrophic Frederiksborg Slotsso. The period covered the decline of the spring bloom, a clear-water phase and a summer phase with increasing phytoplankton biomass. The process rates and changes in pools of organic carbon were combined in a carbon budget for the epilimnion. The POC budget showed a close balance for both the post-spring bloom and the clear-water phase, while a surplus was found in the summer phase. Production of POC was dominated by phytoplankton (2/3) compared to bacteria (1/3) during all phases, and there was a significant correlation between phytoplankton and bacterial production rates (r(2) = 0.48, P < 0.039). Bacterial demand for DOC was balanced by production and changes in the pool of DOC during the decline of the spring bloom, but the calculated demand exceeded the supply by 81 and 167%, respectively, during the other two periods. The discrepancy was most probably due to an underestimation of bacterial growth efficiency and an overestimation of in situ bacterial production in carbon units. Production of bacterial substrate by zooplankton activity was estimated to be higher than the direct excretion of organic carbon from phytoplankton. The biological succession was regulated by the balance between area primary production and community grazing. The clear-water phase was initiated by a combination of low primary production due to low surface irradiance and high community grazing (100 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)), which caused a decrease in phytoplankton biomass. However, due to the high initial phytoplankton biomass, community grazing was not high enough to cause a significant decrease in area primary production. The summer phase was initiated by a decrease in community grazing followed by an increase in phytoplankton biomass. Based on these observations and calculations of area primary production as a function of chlorophyll concentrations, we suggest that the possibility for zooplankton to regulate phytoplankton biomass in temperate lakes decreases with increasing nutrient level.

The number of first-order fluctuations of delta O-18 of the outer shell layer along the maximum growth axis was consistent with the number of cultured years. The dominant factor controlling annual delta O-18 fluctuations was water temperature with a minor contribution from the variation in delta O-18 of ambient water, especially during the rainy season. The delta C-13 values were approximately constant throughout the life of the mussel, suggesting that the contributions of body size to delta C-13 of the shell were minor. We observed nine distinct disturbance rings on the outer surface of the shell. Five rings coincided with the five winter peaks of the delta O-18 profile, indicating winter growth cessation below approximately 10A degrees C, probably because of either inactive growth at low water temperatures or reproduction. Summer disturbance rings were not observed in all years. Moreover, some summer rings showed discontinuity in the inner structure. These findings suggest that summer growth cessation may be caused by occasional events such as heavy rains, as the decrease of dissolved oxygen concentration. The delta O-18 profile and shell structures indicated that shell aragonite was precipitated at close to equilibrium conditions with respect to the oxygen isotope composition of the ambient water. Hyriopsis sp. shells can potentially be used for reconstruction of past hydrologic conditions. The delta O-18 of a pearl indicated that calcification occurred over a temperature range of at least 13-23A degrees C. The optimal temperature for pearl calcification in this species is lower than that for marine pearl calcification.

J	Bradbury, JP				Bradbury, JP			Sources of glacial moisture in Mesoamerica	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Paleoclimatic records from Mesoamerica document the interplay between Atlantic and Pacific sources of precipitation during the last glacial stage and Holocene. Today, and throughout much of the Holocene, the entire region receives its principal moisture in the summer from an interaction of easterly trade winds with the equatorial calms. Glacial records from sites east of 95 degrees W in Guatemala, Florida, northern Venezuela and Colombia record dry conditions before 12 ka, however. West of 95 degrees W, glacial conditions were moister than in the Holocene. For example, pollen and diatom data show that Lake Patzcuaro in the central Mexican highlands was cool, deep and fresh during this time and fossil pinyon needles in packrat middens in Chihuahua, Sonora, Arizona, and Texas indicate cooler glacial climates with increased winter precipitation. Cold Gulf of Mexico sea-surface temperatures and reduced strength of the equatorial calms can explain arid full and late glacial environments east of 95 degrees W whereas an intensified pattern of winter, westerly air flow dominated hydrologic balances as far south as 20 degrees N. Overall cooler temperatures may have increased effective moisture levels during dry summer months in both areas.

(Digenea: Azygiidae) from the Au Train River, Au Train, Michigan are described, with emphasis on the cercarial stage. Progenetic cercariae develop in rediae in the snail Elimia livescens and emerge seasonally from mid-summer to mid-autumn. Cercariae emerge naturally between 1000 and 2100 hr EDT. Adults were retrieved from several naturally infected fish species. Specimens of Coitus bairdi (n = 16) displayed the greatest prevalence (75%), mean intensity (7.1), and abundance (5.3) of infection. Experimental infections were successful in C. bairdi, Lepomis macrochirus, and Perca flavescens. The geographical range of this parasite is limited to the portion of the Au Train River between Au Train Lake and Lake Superior.																			0022-3395					JUN	1995	81	3					442	445		10.2307/3283829	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3283829								7776132					WOS:A1995RD34000016
J	Noges, T; Kangro, K				Noges, T; Kangro, K			Primary production of phytoplankton in a strongly stratified temperate lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Verevi (12.6 ha, maximum depth 11.0 m, mean depth 3.6 m) is a strongly eutrophic and stratified lake. Planktothrix agardhii is the most characteristic phytoplankton species in summer and autumn, while photosynthesizing sulphur bacteria can occur massively in the metalimnion. Primary production (PP) and chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a) were seasonally studied in 1991, 1993, 2000, and 2001. Vertical distribution of PP was rather complex, having usually two peaks, one at or near the surface (0-1 m), and another deeper (at 3-7 m) in the metalimnion. The values of dark fixation of CO2 in the metalimnion were in most cases higher than those in the upper water layer. Considering the average daily PP 896 mg C m(-2) and yearly PP 162 mg C m(-2), Secchi depth 2.34 m, and epilimnetic concentrations of chlorophyll a (19.6 ing m(-3)), total nitrogen and total phosphorus (TP, 52 mg m(-3)) in 2000, L. Verevi is a eutrophic lake of a 'good' status. Considering the total amounts of nutrients stored in the hypolimnion, the average potential concentrations in the whole water column could achieve 1885 mg m(-3) of TN and 170 mg m(-3) of TP reflecting hypertrophic conditions and a 'bad' status. Improvement of the epilimnetic water quality from the 1990s to the 2000s may have resulted from incomplete spring mixing and might not reflect the real improvement. A decreased nutrient concentration in the epilimnion has supported the establishment of a 'clear epilimnion state' allowing light to penetrate into the nutrient-rich metalimmon and sustaining a high production of cyanobacteria and phototrophic sulphur bacteria.

J	Thompson, PA; Hosja, W				Thompson, PA; Hosja, W			Nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in the upper Swan River Estuary, Western Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												During 1993-94 the phytoplankton community in the upper Swan River estuary had a peak chlorophyll a concentration of 57 mg m(-3) during early summer (December 1993) and a second peak of 35 mg m(-3) during late autumn (May 1994). Mid summer was characterized by low cell densities and low chlorophyll a concentrations. The potential of the phytoplankton community for nutrient limitation was assessed with dilution bioassays given nutrient mixes deficient in one of the following: nitrogen, phosphate, silicate, iron, trace metals, chelators, or vitamins. During the mid-summer period of low phytoplankton abundance, nitrogen was the nutrient with the greatest potential to limit algal biomass. During mid summer, ambient N:P ratios tended to be near unity and bioassays indicated that the available pool of N was up to 20 times more limiting to biomass development than was available P. Also during mid summer, bioassay treatments given no nitrogen and control treatments given no nutrients showed little growth, reaching chlorophyll a concentrations similar to 1/30th of those given a full suite of nutrients. Chlorophyll a concentrations in the bioassay control treatments given no nutrients were correlated (r(2) = 0.74) with measured surface nitrate concentrations; this suggested that nitrate inputs may be a major factor controlling phytoplankton biomass in this ecoystem. The correlation between surface nitrate concentration and rainfall (r(2) = 0.69) further suggests that rainfall may be the most important mechanism supplying nitrate to the surface waters of this estuary.

Additionally, the drivers of the differences between sediment and water assemblages are still unclear. The present study investigated the variation of AOA and AOB communities in both water columns and sediments of eutrophic freshwater Dianchi Lake. The abundance, diversity, and structure of both planktonic and sediment ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in Dianchi Lake showed the evident changes with sampling site and time. In both water columns and sediments, AOB amoA gene generally outnumbered AOA, and the AOB/AOA ratio was much higher in summer than in autumn. The total AOA amoA abundance was relatively great in autumn, while sediment AOB was relatively abundant in summer. Sediment AOA amoA abundance was likely correlated with ammonia nitrogen (rs = 0.963). The AOB/AOA ratio in lake sediment was positively correlated with total phosphorus (rs = 0.835), while pH, dissolved organic carbon, and ammonia nitrogen might be the key driving forces for the AOB/AOA ratio in lake water. Sediment AOA and AOB diversity was correlated with nitrate nitrogen (rs = -0.786) and total organic carbon (rs = 0.769), respectively, while planktonic AOB diversity was correlated with ammonia nitrogen (rs = 0.854). Surface water and sediment in the same location had a distinctively different microbial community structure. In addition, sediment AOB community structure was influenced by total phosphorus, while total phosphorus might be a key determinant of planktonic AOB community structure.					; Wu, Zhen/GZG-5518-2022; liu, yong/AAD-1467-2019; ZHAO, QUN/HMP-0262-2023; Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008	Wu, Zhen/0000-0001-8474-4274; Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080													0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2016	23	15					15358	15369		10.1007/s11356-016-6707-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6707-0								27109114					WOS:000380369900063

Factors affecting water willow establishment in a large reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the transplanting potential of an emergent macrophyte, water willow ( Justicia americana), into Rend Lake, a large, relatively unvegetated reservoir in southern Illinois. We transplanted water willow over two years into sites varying in physical conditions and using four propagule types. Transplanting in 2001 was performed to compare the durability of root crowns, plugs, and stem fragments, as well as to measure the effect of open water versus backwater sites on water willow survival. Water willow was transplanted in 2002 to explore how different planting protocols, such as planting in different months, planting different propagule types, and shoreline slope affect water willow survival. We found that water willow transplanted early in the summer had better post-winter colony survival and vigor ( stem density within colonies) than transplants conducted later in the summer (Kruskal-Wallis test; P = 0.017). Rooted propagules had significantly greater first-year colony survival and ultimately exhibited greater vigor in newly established colonies. Lastly, we found that shoreline slope had a significant influence on the vigor of colonies following winter dormancy but was not significantly related to first-year colony vigor. In the summer following their initial transplanting, established water willow colonies planted on shorelines with steeper slopes (>5 degrees) produced more plants than those planted on shallower shorelines (Kruskal-Wallis test; P = 0.003). Water willow seems to have high potential as a transplant species for reservoir management and riparian zone enhancement.

Bacterial diversity and active biomass in full-scale granular activated carbon filters operated at low water temperatures	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration enhances the removal of natural organic matter and micropollutants in drinking water treatment. Microbial communities in GAC filters contribute to the removal of the biodegradable part of organic matter, and thus help to control microbial regrowth in the distribution system. Our objectives were to investigate bacterial community dynamics, identify the major bacterial groups, and determine the concentration of active bacterial biomass in full-scale GAC filters treating cold (3.7-9.5 degrees C), physicochemically pretreated, and ozonated lake water. Three sampling rounds were conducted to study six GAC filters of different operation times and flow modes in winter, spring, and summer. Total organic carbon results indicated that both the first-step and second-step filters contributed to the removal of organic matter. Length heterogeneity analysis of amplified 16S rRNA genes illustrated that bacterial communities were diverse and considerably stable over time. alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, and Nitrospira dominated in all of the GAC filters, although the relative proportion of dominant phylogenetic groups in individual filters differed. The active bacterial biomass accumulation, measured as adenosine triphosphate, was limited due to low temperature, low flux of nutrients, and frequent backwashing. The concentration of active bacterial biomass was not affected by the moderate seasonal temperature variation. In summary, the results provided an insight into the biological component of GAC filtration in cold water temperatures and the operational parameters affecting it.

Continued exposure to water currents has directly and indirectly affected the integrity of the wreck and resulted in management interventions including efforts to stabilize the wreck and control vessel activity (both duration and speed). Despite these efforts, a scour ring is present in the sediment around the Sweepstakes, raising concerns regarding the prolonged stability of the wreck. An extensive series of field measurements were made during the summer of 2015 with the aim of differentiating between natural hydrological processes present at this site and human-derived water movements during the summer visitor season. There is a high-degree of natural current variability from processes as diverse as wind-induced surface gravity waves, internal gravity waves, and diurnal flows due to differential heating. Our results show that summer circulation driven by internal gravity waves derived from upwelling, surface waves, and differential heating was insignificant with respect to sediment resuspension and thus unlikely to produce the observed scour around the shipwreck. Scour is most likely caused by energetic winter storms, which should be a focus of future studies. While vessel induced currents were detectable at the shipwreck, they were no larger than the normal summer hydrodynamic variability, thus suggesting that management efforts continue to protect the site generally.

In this study, the mid- to late Holocene varved sediments of Lake Mondsee (Upper Austria) were analysed by combining sedimentological, geophysical and geochemical methods. This approach allows to distinguish two types of detrital layers related to different types of extreme runoff events (floods and debris flows) and to detect changes in flood activity during the last 7100 years. In total, 271 flood and 47 debris flow layers, deposited during spring and summer, were identified, which cluster in 18 main flood episodes (FE 1-18) with durations of 30-50 years each. These main flood periods occurred during the Neolithic (7100-7050 vyr BP and 6470-4450 vyr BP), the late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age (3300-3250 and 2800-2750 vyr BP), the late Iron Age (2050-2000 vyr BP), throughout the Dark Ages Cold Period (1500-1200 vyr BP), and at the end of the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age (810-430 vyr BP). Summer flood episodes in Lake Mondsee are generally more abundant during the last 1500 years, often coinciding with major advances of Alpine glaciers. Prior to 1500 vyr BP, spring/summer floods and debris flows are generally less frequent, indicating a lower number of intense rainfall events that triggered erosion. In comparison with the increase of late Holocene flood activity in western and northwestern (NW) Europe, commencing already as early as 2800 yr BP, the hydro-meteorological shift in the Lake Mondsee region occurred much later. These time lags in the onset of increased hydrological activity might be either due to regional differences in atmospheric circulation pattern or to the sensitivity of the individual flood archives. The Lake Mondsee sediments represent the first precisely dated and several millennia long summer flood record for the northeastern (NE) Alps, a key region at the climatic boundary of Atlantic, Mediterranean and East European air masses, aiding a better understanding of regional and seasonal peculiarities of flood occurrence under changing climate conditions.

Relationships were developed between bioassay-determined BAP and a combination of soluble reactive P and NaOH-extractable P. Relationships were consistent whether from Lake Sammamish monthly samples plus summer samples from 29 other lakes (r2 = 0.80) or from the inflow stream (r2 = 0.82). Seasonal changes in BAP were predicted slightly more reliably than TP, using a mass balance model and the 10-year data set. Also, a linear, arithmetic relationship between spring BAP and summer chlorophyll a represented the best fit of past data (r2 = 0.84, n = 11) and is more reliable than published log-log, TP-chlorophyll a relationships for predicting the specific response of Lake Sammamish to increased urban runoff.																			0043-1303					SEP	1988	60	9					1663	1669																WOS:A1988Q000500014

The four components of surface energy balance, including net radiation, latent heat, sensible heat, and heat storage, were estimated using the eleven years (2002-2012) daily MODIS data together with in-situ measurements. Good agreement was found between the seasonal turbulent heat fluxes calculated from satellite data and those from the direct measurements (eddy covariance method) with correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.95 for sensible heat and latent heat, respectively. There were temporal, spatial heterogeneities, and strong seasonal pattern for all of the four components, which were very high in summer and low in winter for net radiation and heat storage. In contrast, latent heat and sensible heat were very high in the winter and very low in the summer. Trend analysis revealed long term changes for each of the energy balance components, particularly the increase in latent heat which was equivalent to evaporation rate of 0.017 mm m(-2) per year, indicating that lake evaporation increased by 0.19 mm m(-2) over the eleven years observation period. This was possibly a result of a smaller amount of over lake ice cover and an increase in surface water temperature of Lake Huron.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0402-5; 978-1-5106-0403-2				2016	9999								99990B	10.1117/12.2241516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2241516													WOS:000391353700010

The extreme seasonal temperatures predicted for fish ages 0-2 years suggest that adults inhabit close to the thermocline during the summer, whereas juveniles reside inshore. So far, data about the use of space in deep lakes were available only for the winter months in the case of adult whitefish and were almost inexistent for juveniles. High-resolution stable isotope analyses of otoliths appear to provide complementary information to that provided by other methods (catch-based data, hydroacoustics and telemetry) previously applied to the study of the vertical positioning of whitefish. Moreover, intra- and inter-annual variations in oxygen isotope values could be used as a method of aging in addition to examining growth rings of scales or otoliths.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47062-4				2007	60						195	+																WOS:000249090200014
J	Yin, HB; Fan, CX				Yin, Hongbin; Fan, Chengxin			Dynamics of Reactive Sulfide and its Control on Metal Bioavailability and Toxicity in Metal-Polluted Sediments from Lake Taihu, China	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												This study was conducted to elucidate the vertical and seasonal distribution of acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) in sediment cores of metal-polluted areas of Lake Taihu, China. The concentrations of AVS in sediments were more dynamic than the SEM values, which were higher in warmer seasons. Two types of AVS profiles were identified in the studied area. Generally, the AVS levels increased at a certain depth (6-18 cm), below which they decreased, except for two sites during summer. Very high concentrations of AVS were observed at these two sites during summer, and its concentrations decreased almost exponentially with increased depth. The higher content of AVS near surface sediments in summer at these two sites was attributed to a high input of organic matter resulting from dead algal deposits. The SEM contents decreased with depth and remained almost constant with season. Metal toxicity in the sediment cores was assessed on the basis of three models: Sigma SEM - AVS, Sigma SEM/AVS, and Sigma SEM - AVS/f(OC), and the results showed that toxicity occurred in the surface sediment interval (0-1 cm) at one site during winter.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				MAY	2011	60	4					565	575		10.1007/s00244-010-9575-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-010-9575-5								20665211					WOS:000291980000001

However, few studies have fully considered the internal linkages within the regional climate system, which may limit our understanding of the forcing mechanisms of Holocene climate change in this region. Here, we systematically consider three major issues of the moisture/precipitation, temperature and near-surface wind relevant to the Holocene climate history of Xinjiang. First, despite there still has debated for the Holocene moisture evolution in this region, more climatic reconstructions from lake sediments, loess, sand-dunes and peats support a long-term regional wetting trend. Second, temperature records from ice cores, peats and stalagmites demonstrate a long-term winter warming trend during the Holocene in middle- to high-latitudes of Asia. Third, recent studies of aeolian sedimentary sequences reveal that the near-surface winds in winter gradually weakened during the Holocene, whereas the winter mid-latitude Westerlies strengthened in the Tienshan Mountains. Based on this evidence, in the arid Xinjiang region we propose an early to middle Holocene relatively cold and dry interval, with strong near-surface winds; and a warmer, wetter interval with weaker near-surface winds in the middle to late Holocene during winter. Additionally, we develop a conceptual model to explain the pattern of Holocene climate changes in this region. From the early to the late Holocene, the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and winter insolation, and the shrinking of high-latitude continental ice-sheets, resulted in increasing winter temperatures in middle to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Subsequently, the increased winter temperature strengthened the winter mid-latitude Westerlies and weakened the Siberian high-pressure system, which caused an increase in winter precipitation and a decrease in near-surface wind strength. This scenario is strongly supported by evidence from geological records, climate simulation results, and modern reanalysis data. Our hypothesis highlights the important contribution of winter temperature in driving the Holocene climatic evolution of the arid Xinjiang region, and it implies that the socio-economic development and water resources security of this region will face serious challenges presented by the increasing winter temperature in the future.

Seasonal field surveys conducted during the spring, summer, and fall of 2023-2024 revealed notable spatial and temporal variation in water quality, with pH ranging from 7.54 to 8.87, EC from 316 to 645 mu S/cm, and turbidity between 0.36 and 5.76 NTU. Total dissolved solids (TDS) values and ionic compositions indicated increased salinization in some zones, particularly those exposed to high evaporation and shoreline disturbance. Heavy metal analysis identified elevated levels of aluminum, manganese, and zinc at several sampling points; however, concentrations generally remained within national environmental standards. Vegetation surveys showed that disturbed areas-especially those affected by grazing and tourism-exhibited reduced native plant diversity and dominance of invasive species. Socio-economic interviews with local herders and stakeholders indicated that 67.3% of households experienced declining livestock productivity, and 37.1% reported increased allergies or respiratory symptoms linked to deteriorating environmental conditions. Despite some ongoing conservation efforts, respondents expressed dissatisfaction with enforcement and impact. These findings highlight the need for community-driven, integrated lake management strategies that address environmental degradation, climate adaptation, and rural livelihood security.

J	Lindell, MJ; Granéli, H; Bertilsson, S				Lindell, MJ; Granéli, H; Bertilsson, S			Seasonal photoreactivity of dissolved organic matter from lakes with contrasting humic content	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We studied seasonal variability in photodegradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) resulting from artificial ultraviolet-A (UV-A) and UV-B irradiation. Water samples were taken approximately monthly from the surface layers of two oligotrophic lakes with contrasting humic content, situated in southern Sweden. Lake water was filter-sterilized (0.2 mum) and exposed to artificial UV radiation in quartz tubes. Potential DOC photodegradation, measured as a photoproduction of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and oxalic, malonic, formic, and acetic acid in irradiated samples, was observed throughout the sampling period. In addition, exposure to UV radiation resulted in a decrease in DOC, absorbance, and humic substance fluorescence. The photoproduction of DIC and the low molecular weight (LMW) organic acids varied seasonally, being generally higher in winter and spring (December-May), while DOC appeared to become less photoreactive after the extensive exposure to solar radiation during summer. Production rates of both DIC and LMW organic acids were approximately eight times higher in the humic lake despite that the DOC concentration was only two times higher than in the clearwater lake. This is most probably due to the high input of allochthonous DOC and the resulting higher absorbance to DOC ratio in the humic system. Furthermore, the longer hydraulic residence time in the clearwater system could have resulted in an accumulation of residual DOC, recalcitrant to further photodegradation.																			0706-652X					MAY	2000	57	5					875	885		10.1139/cjfas-57-5-875	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-5-875													WOS:000087273200001
J	Sorapipatana, C				Sorapipatana, Chumnong			An assessment of solar energy potential in Kampuchea	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												A satellite technique was adopted to assess solar energy potential in Kampuchea. The study aims to explore solar irradiation potential and distribution under the influence of Asian monsoons over land and a large water surface of a lake by using the satellite technique, with a relatively small spatial scale, which have never been accessed before. In this study, the solar irradiation potential over Kampuchea (10 degrees N-14.5 degrees N, 101.5 degrees E-105 degrees E) was estimated at interval of half a degree grid. The seasonal variations of mean daily solar irradiation in Kampuchea were measured during two Asian winter and summer monsoon seasons. The results revealed that the mean solar irradiation depends more on orographic effects than on seasonal changes. During the winter monsoon, the local minimal means of daily solar irradiation were found on the great Lake Tonle Sap and on the northern, windward side of the Elephant Mountain with a range of 13-14 MJ m(-2) day(-1). The local maximal means of daily solar irradiation were found on the northwestern part of Kampuchea, with a value of 18 MJ m(-2) day(-1). In contrast, during the summer monsoon, the local minimal means of daily solar irradiation were, again, found on the same mountainous region of the Elephant Mountain, but the area of minimal means shifted to the southern side where it is the windward side of the mountain during the summer monsoon with a value of 12 MJ m(-2) day(-1). The local maximal means of the daily solar irradiation were found scattered over various areas: south of Lake Tonle Sap and at various places in the north and northwestern parts of the country, with a range of 18-19 MJ m(-2) day(-1). It was also found that a high mean of solar irradiation is generally associated with a low standard deviation, i.e., it is less in temporal variation. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Factors affecting trap-net catchability of black crappies in natural Minnesota lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We quantified the effects of length-group (150-199, 200-249, and 250-299 mm), sampling period (September, October, early spring, and late spring), lake, and intraspecific density on catchability q of black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus in trap nets (modified fyke nets) set in eight natural Minnesota lakes during 1996-2001. The catchability of the two larger length-groups exceeded that of the smallest length-group in all lakes. Catchability in early and late spring exceeded that in September or October in most lakes; otherwise, q did not differ among sampling periods. Catchability differed among lakes during September, October, and early-spring sampling periods but did not differ among lakes in late spring. For 150-199-mm fish, q increased with increasing lake surface area during all sampling periods, decreased with increasing shoreline development ratio during all periods, decreased with increasing maximum depth during fall sampling periods, and was unrelated to the percentage of surface area of lakes less than 4.6 m deep. Catchability, of the larger length-groups was unrelated to any of these lake morphometric variables. Catchability of 150-199-mm black crappies decreased with increasing density during all sampling periods. However, the q of 200-249-mm black crappies was density independent during early spring and September, decreased with increasing density in October, and may have been density dependent in late spring. For 250-299-mm black crappies, the q in early spring decreased with increasing density, and the q in late spring was density independent. Trap-net catch per unit effort (CPUE) provides more meaningful data on the relative abundance of 200-mm and longer black crappies than it does for smaller black crappies. Comparisons of trap-net CPUE and length-frequency distributions are most meaningful if trap-net samples are collected during the same sampling period and within the same lake.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2006	26	3					652	664		10.1577/M05-101.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-101.1													WOS:000240753900019
J	Millie, DF; Carrick, HJ; Doering, PH; Steidinger, KA				Millie, DF; Carrick, HJ; Doering, PH; Steidinger, KA			Intra-annual variability of water quality and phytoplankton in the North Fork of the St. Lucie River Estuary, Florida (USA): a quantitative assessment	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Water quality and phytoplankton were examined within the North Fork of the St. Lucie River Estuary, Florida (USA) from March 2000 to March 2001. Alterations in water-quality parameters and phytoplankton assemblages mirrored salinity regimes resulting from the `wet'/`dry' seasonality of south Florida. Salinity was greatest during the `dry', winter months whereas water temperature and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were greatest during the `wet', summer months. A seasonal dissimilarity in phytoplankton occurred; cell abundance of cyanobacterial picoplankton (Synechocystis sp., Synechococcus sp.) and a diatom (Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve) and cell carbon of a dinoflagellate (Gyrodinium sp.) and S. costatum were greatest during summer whereas abundance of chrysophytes (Chrysochromulina parva Lackey, Chromulina sp.) and carbon of dinoflagellates (Gymnodinium spp., Heterocapsa rotundata (Lohmann) Hansen) and a diatom (Cyclotella sp.) were greatest during winter. Watercolumn chlorophyll a concentrations reached up to 29 mug L-1 and were negatively associated with salinity. Diatom chlorophyll comprised the majority and at times, greater than 90% of the total chlorophyll a. Picoplanktonic cyanobacteria comprised up to 5% and 1.4% of total phytoplankton carbon and chlorophyll a, respectively throughout the estuary; as such, its impact on overall assemblage rate processes and system-level function appeared minimal. Sediment and whole-water incubations confirmed the presence of heterotrophic dinoflagellates within the estuary. Dissolved oxygen concentrations did not correspond with total chlorophyll a concentrations and salinity, indicating that hypoxia within bottom waters during summer was not solely attributable to phytoplankton biomass or water-column stratification but likely, a result of multiple, interacting physical/chemical and biological factors.

The four sampling stations were situated in basins representing a transition from hypertrophy to mesotrophy and maximum depths from 3 m to 33 m. The maximal phytoplankton biomasses ranged from 5 to 33 mg l(-1) and the maximal zooplankton biomasses from 160 to 520 mu g C l(-1). Cyanophytes dominated the phytoplankton biomass in summer and the copepod biomass was higher than that of cladocerans at all the stations. No spring peak in the zooplankton biomass occurred and the average size of daphnids was below 1 mm. At present, the top-down control of phytoplankton biomass is thus ineffective. However, the water quality and morphometry of L. Hiidenvesi seem favourable for biomanipulation. The nutrient concentrations and external loading fall in the limits that facilitate successful restoration and the morphometry of the lake is favourable for the recolonization by submerged macrophytes. However, since stations 2 and 3 receive their nutrient loading mainly from station 1, restoration of station 1 may be crucial for the whole lake. This may not be achieved through food web management alone, but requires a reduction of the nutrient flow from River Vihtijoki.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	412						81	94		10.1023/A:1003804417036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003804417036													WOS:000084827100009

Permafrost landforms such as drained-lakes, low-centered polygons, strangmoor ridges and reticulate-patterned ground retard surface drainage and increase surface storage. This accounts for the abundance of lakes, ponds and wetlands found in many low-gradient arctic catchments. Near annual maximum solar energy during the summer, coupled with available surface water, results in substantial vertical fluxes of water back to the atmosphere by evaporation, but augmented by transpiration. Evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation during the summer months. Extensive wetlands dry out during the summer; this produces potential surface storage for future rainfall or snowmelt and fragments the existing drainage network. The connectivity of the drainage network is only restored through large inputs of water into the basin; this generally occurs during the next spring snowmelt. A three-year case study of the Putuligayuk River catchment (471 km(2)) in northern Alaska will be presented.

The impact of air pollution on sperm DNA methylation	REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY												A number of environmental factors have been shown to impact the sperm epigenome. Air pollution is one of the largest health and environmental hazards in the world today and has been implicated in many modern diseases. Recently, air pollution has been shown to alter methylation signatures in some body tissues, indicating that air pollution may also affect the sperm epigenome. The present experiment was conducted to analyze how seasonal air pollution in the Salt Lake Valley may impact DNA methylation patterns in sperm and to establish a relationship between air pollution and sperm epigenetic health as measured by DNA methylation. Sperm DNA methylation patterns were assessed in 74 individuals, who presented at the University of Utah Andrology Clinic for semen analysis, using the Illumina Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Each semen sample collected, as per the fifth edition of WHO reference values for human semen characterization, was deemed normal. Two sample groups from the Salt Lake Valley, Urban Winter (UW, n = 20), Urban Summer (US, n = 21), and two sample groups east of the Wasatch mountains, Rural Winter (RW, n = 19) and Rural Summer (RS, n = 14), were compared to assess the effect of air pollution on sperm DNA methylation patterns. Due to seasonal inversions, urban winters are characterized by increased air pollution compared to summer months. Therefore, the UW sample group was designated as treatment and the three remaining groups (US, RW, RS) were designated as control. We conducted multiple differential methylation analyses using a sliding window approach which utilized the USeq software package. A sliding window analysis of UW versus US was conducted first, followed by a confirmatory analysis comparing UW versus RW and RS. Outputs from the USeq analysis were assessed using several tools including the Stanford GREAT analysis and an analysis of methylation instability at key promoter regions in sperm. The sliding window analysis identified six differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between the UW and US groups (Wilcoxon FDR >= 40, corresponding p-value of similar to 0.0001). Three of these six regions were confirmed with the second confirmatory analysis of UW versus RS/RW (Wilcoxon FDR >= 20, p-value<0.01). According to a GREAT analysis, each of the identified regions exhibited multiple gene ontology associations. Air pollution subtly alters DNA methylation in sperm, indicating that certain regions of the sperm epigenome may be susceptible to air pollution-induced modification with possible implications for reproductive and offspring health.																			0890-6238	1873-1708				MAR	2025	132								108850	10.1016/j.reprotox.2025.108850	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2025.108850		FEB 2025						39894374					WOS:001423937400001

Streams interconnect the four largest lakes, forming the drainage network that flows into the Inn River at the town of Lavin. The drainage network of Macun consists of a north and a south basin that overlie an ortho-gneiss, meta-granitoid bedrock. The south basin is influenced by various rock glaciers. The physico-chemistry of surface waters at 10 sites has been monitored annually in mid-summer since 2001. Further, an YSI EXO2 Multiparameter Sonde (Exosonde) with various water quality sensors has been employed since 2016 at the last lake in the network to examine seasonal and diel patterns in physico-chemistry. Results showed clear physico-chemical differences between the two basins, which mostly reflect rock-glacier inputs in the south basin. Nitrogen values were two-fold higher and particulate phosphorus values two-fold lower in the south basin than in the north basin. Over time, the physico-chemistry in the two basins became more homogeneous, with a reduction in rock-glacial inputs in the south basin and an overall decrease in nitrogen in the catchment. Data from 30 springs and tributaries sampled in 2002 and 2017 reflected the basin differences and temporal changes observed at the primary study sites. Continuous temperature records showed north basin streams to be ca. 3 degrees C warmer than south-basin streams, but with high inter-annual variation that reflected annual differences in weather and no evidence of a general change over time (increase or decrease). Exosonde data revealed strong seasonality in measured parameters as well as seasonality in diel patterns (e. g., dissolved oxygen, temperature, chlorophyll-a); diel fluctuations were most pronounced in summer and least in winter. The results highlight the importance of long-term monitoring for understanding ecosystem state changes in alpine freshwaters, especially during periods of rapid environmental change.					; consoli, gabriele/AFK-6270-2022	Ebi, Christian/0000-0001-8433-8700; Consoli, Gabriele/0000-0002-9336-9151; 													2073-106X	2073-1558				JUL	2022	14	2					11	23		10.1553/eco.mont-14-2s11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1553/eco.mont-14-2s11													WOS:000818902800003

Diel mercury concentration variations in a mercury-impacted stream	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Filtered and particulate mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MMHg), and associated water chemistry parameters, were evaluated bi-hourly for several 30 h periods during the summer and winter seasons at several distinct locations (downstream forested, midstream urban/suburban, upstream industrial) along a creek contaminated with high levels of inorganic Hg to determine if biogeochemical Hg and MMHg cycles respond to the daily photocycle. In summer particulate Hg and MMHg concentrations doubled overnight (excluding the upstream industrial site) concurrent with increases in turbidity and total suspended sediment; no such pattern was evident in winter. Seasonal and diel changes in the activity of macrobiota affecting the suspension of contaminated sediments are likely responsible for these patterns as other potential explanatory variables (e.g., instrument drift, pH, discharge) could not account for the range and timing of our observations. Diel patterns in filtered Hg (Hg-D) were significant only at locations and times of the year when channel shading was not present and daytime concentrations increased 22-89% above nighttime minima likely caused by direct and indirect photochemical reactions. Relationships between Hg-D and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration or character were inconsistent between sites. Unlike Hg-D, there were significant diel patterns in filtered MMHg (MMHgD) at all sites and times of year, with summer concentrations peaking in mid to late afternoon while the timing differed in winter, with concentrations peaking after sunset. Daily variability in MMHgD concentration ranged between 25 and 75%. The results imply key controls on net methylation occur within the stream or on the stream bed and include factors such as small-scale temperature changes in the water column and photosynthetic activity of stream biofilm. With respect to stream monitoring, results from this study indicate (1) consistent timing in stream Hg and MMHg sampling is required for accurate assessment of long-term trends, (2) in situ measurements of turbidity can be used to quantify diel dynamics of both particulate Hg and MMHg concentrations, and (3) in situ fluorescing dissolved organic matter (FDOM), a potential proxy for DOC, was not capable of resolving diel dynamics of filtered Hg or MMHg.

Climate exerts a greater modulating effect on the phytoplankton community after 2007 in eutrophic Lake Taihu, China: Evidence from 25 years of recordings	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Long-term phytoplankton community changes indicate the trophic status under nutrient regulation conditions in eutrophic lakes, although the modulatory role of climate change scenarios in their indicative function has been underestimated. Hence, we analyzed the relative contributions of nutrient and climate factors to interannual and seasonal variations in the phytoplankton biomass and composition from 1992 to 2017 in Meiliang Bay, Lake Taihu, China. Discrete phytoplankton communities from five periods were classified according to their interannual features. Variations in the phytoplankton community composition were observed during the five periods, and these variations included a shift from exclusive cyanobacterial dominance before 2008 to diatom-cyanobacterial codominance in 2008-2010 and from cyanobacterial dominance in 2011-2014 to cyanobacterial-diatom codominance in 2015-2017. The phytoplankton biomass pattern typically peaked in summer, although peaks also occurred in winter 2008-2010 and autumn 2011-2014. Additionally, the phytoplankton biomass increased by threefold from 2015 to 2017, which might have been related to rising air temperatures and greater light availability. The variance in the phytoplankton community was significantly explained by nutrient (ammonium, nitrate and phosphate) and climatic (air temperature and wind speed) factors. However, the explaining effect of the factors varied among the five periods: nutrients strongly impacted the community composition from 1992 to 2007, whereas climatic variables became more important modulators after 2007. These results reveal that climatic factors play importance roles in shaping the phytoplankton community and cyanobacterial blooms and suggest that differences in the roles between specific climatic conditions should be considered. Future declines in cyanobacterial blooms require further dual nitrogen and phosphorus reduction and longer recovery times under current climate change scenarios in this and possibly other shallow eutrophic lakes.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; 陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013	Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2019	105						82	91		10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.05.034													WOS:000490574200009
J	Park, H; Chung, S				Park, Hyungseok; Chung, Sewoong			pCO2 Dynamics of Stratified Reservoir in Temperate Zone and CO2 Pulse Emissions During Turnover Events	WATER												This study explores the dynamic changes in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) with depth, and the temporal variations of CO2 net atmospheric flux (NAF) in a stratified reservoir. A total of 16 field campaigns were conducted from the summer stratification to fall turnover period in 2017. A random forest (RF) model was developed to estimate the pCO(2) using concurrently measured water quality variables. The results showed that the vertical distribution of pCO(2) and associated temporal variations of the NAF are closely related to the stratification strength of the reservoir. The reservoir surface pCO(2) was supersaturated (1542 mu atm) in summer (July 11), but this decreased to undersaturation as algae grew. Meanwhile, dissolved CO2 continuously accumulated below the reservoir mixed-layer due to the thermal stratification barrier and organic-rich floodwater intrusion. Vertical mixing began instantly as the stratification strength began to weaken in mid-October, and the surface pCO(2) increased sharply up to 1934 mu atm. Consequently, the NAF drastically increased to 3235 mg CO2 m(-2) . day(-1), which implies that the NAF changes seasonally and large CO2 pulsing occurs during the turnover events. The results provide valuable information about pCO(2) variability and physical mixing processes, as well as carbon budget estimation in stratified reservoirs, and offer an improved understanding of these phenomena.					; Chung, Sewoong/AAH-3109-2019	Park, Hyungseok/0000-0002-6218-1826; CHUNG, SEWOONG/0000-0002-8596-4970														2073-4441				OCT	2018	10	10							1347	10.3390/w10101347	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10101347													WOS:000451208400062
J	Cho, Y; Yun, R				Cho, Yong; Yun, Rin			A raw water source heat pump air-conditioning system	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS												Raw water source is one of the promising new heat sources that researchers are looking into along with various others water-based sources such as ground, lake, river and sewage water. Generally, the water that is taken from the environment and supplied to a water treatment facility is called raw water. In this study, the heating and cooling performance of a heat pump utilizing the heat energy of raw water supplied to a water treatment facility is investigated. The two heat pumps being investigated have a heating capacity of 65.2 kW and were installed at the site for the heating and cooling of the central control room. A brazed plate heat exchanger was used for obtaining heat energy from the raw water. The raw water source provides a favorable heat source compared to the ambient air source except in spring. In the seasons of spring and autumn, the heating and cooling load are extremely low, this is the main reason for the poor performance of the raw-water heat pump system for those seasons. The average unit COP during the heating season is 3.3, and the average unit COP for the cooling season is 7.2. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Physicochemical influences on Ruppia tuberosa abundance and distribution mediated through life cycle stages	INLAND WATERS												This study determined and contrasted the effect of physicochemical conditions on the distribution and abundance of the life stages of Ruppia tuberosa J. Davis and Tomlinson in neighbouring permanent (Coorong) and ephemeral (Pipe Clay and Cantara) lakes in southeastern South Australia. The distribution and abundance of shoots, flowers, seeds, and turions of R. tuberosa were monitored. Salinity and water depth were identified as the principal physicochemical conditions driving changes in the distribution and abundance of the life stages of R. tuberosa. Extremely high salinity led to reduced germination, flower and seed production, and shoot abundance in the Coorong. Salinity levels in Lake Pipe Clay were favourable for germination but not for flowering; however, Lake Cantara was not only favourable for the establishment of R. tuberosa shoots, but also for flower and seed production. In ephemeral systems, if favourable salinities for germination and growth occur during autumn and winter, R. tuberosa is able to survive elevated spring salinities and persist through either sexual reproduction or the production of turions, depending on salinity levels. The reduced abundances of R. tuberosa at water depths >0.6 m suggest light limitation and that R. tuberosa is a high-light-adapted species. Because salinity is an easily measured parameter with significant biological implications, it is useful for setting environmental flow targets for the Coorong and River Murray estuary.

J	Müller, H; Schlegel, A				Müller, H; Schlegel, A			Responses of three freshwater planktonic ciliates with different feeding modes to cryptophyte and diatom prey	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The filter feeding oligotrich ciliate Strobilidium lacustris, the raptorial prostome ciliate Balanion planctonicum and the diffusion feeding scuticociliate Histiobalantium bodamicum could be cultivated for months/years on a sole diet of Cryptomonas sp., whereas the diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii did not support their growth. With Cryptomonas sp: as food, numerical responses of all ciliates followed a modified Michaelis-Menten model, which at 15 degrees C yielded maximum growth rates of 0.96, 1.87 and 0.33 d(-1) and threshold concentrations of 61, 78 and 290 ng C ml(-1) for S. lacustris, B. planctonicum and H, bodamicum, respectively. Functional response patterns differed between species. In all investigated ciliates, growth rates reached a maximum earlier than ingestion rates, and there were no threshold concentrations for zero ingestion. Food selectivity depended on feeding mode. H. bodamicum was not able to ingest the non-motile diatoms. Both S. lacustris and B. planctonicum selectively preferred cryptophytes when offered a mixed diet. This effect was more pronounced in the raptorial feeder compared to the filter feeder. Our results indicate that during the phytoplankton spring bloom in Lake Constance prostome and oligotrich ciliates mainly exploit cryptophytes, and that the scuticociliate H. bodamicum, due to its slow growth, is an inferior competitor during this season. The observed threshold concentrations suggest that during the rest of the year prostomes and oligotrichs must rely on small-scale patches of this food, whereas H. bodamicum, with maximum development in late summer and autumn, presumably consumes a much larger variety of prey.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				APR 30	1999	17	1					49	60		10.3354/ame017049	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame017049													WOS:000080660500005

A total of 42 species were collected, of which 19 are new records for the state [Latona setifera, Pseudosida bidentata, Daphnia pulex, D. laevis, Simocephalus exspinosus, S. serrulatus, Macrothrix rosea, Alona costata, A. guttata, A. intermedia, Camptocercus rectirostris, Monospilus sp., Eurycercus (Bulatifrons) vernalis, Pseudochydorus globosus, Caecidotea obtusa, C. laticaudata, Porcellionides floria, Miktoniscus halophilus and Eulimnadia ventricosa]. Winter crustacean fauna is dominated by the cladocerans Simocephalus serrulatus and Eurycercus (Bulatifrons) vernalis, the isopods Caecidotea forbesi and Lirceus lineatus, the amphipods Hyalella azteca and Crangonyx richmondensis, mature individuals of the shrimp Palaemonetes paludosus, and the crayfish Procambarus (Ortmannicus) blandingii. Spring is characterized by high water levels, population pulses in several caldoceran species, occasional occurrences of the anostracan Streptocephalus seali and conchostracan Eulimnadia ventricosa, and more habitats for C. forbesi and P. (O.) blandingii. Summer crustacean fauna is dominated by H. azteca, Caecidotea laticaudata, reduced numbers of C. forbesi, and immature speciments of P. paludosus. Variations exist among species with respect to the types of habitats inhabited (ditches, pools, impoundments, lake) and seasons of abundance and reproductive activity. Most species have been previously documented as being closely associated with aquatic macrophytes, which reach high densities in several habitats.																			0193-4406					JAN	1989		15					7	30																WOS:A1989T466500002

Through measurements from the surface of the TGR, a CH4 emission rate was recorded as 0.26 +/- 0.38 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (Mean +/- SD), relatively low compared with those from other hydropower reservoirs. We also recorded CH4 emission rate from the surface of downstream water, which was also relatively low (0.24 +/- 0.37 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Such result may indicate that TGR is not a great CH4 emitter (not "CH4 menace"). One possible reason for such a low emission rate is that measures to maintain water quality and protect environment and ecosystem decrease the input of organic materials (for methanogenesis), which in turn limits the CH4 production in the sediment of the TGR. We also found that CH4 emission from the flooding drawdown area (0.29 +/- 0.37 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) was higher than other permanently flooded sites (0.23 +/- 0.38 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Because of annual vegetation re-growth, the drawdown zone is the especially important carbon source for methanogenesis in flooding season. Interestingly, we also observed that mean CH4 emission was significantly higher in winter than in spring and summer. This was partly due to seasonal dynamics of hydrology. In order to estimate the net CH4 emissions caused by the reservoir and reservoir operation, the best approach would be Life Cycle Analysis.

J	Rellstab, C; Bürgi, HR; Müller, R				Rellstab, C; Bürgi, HR; Müller, R			Population regulation in coregonids:: the significance of zooplankton concentration for larval mortality	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI					8th International Symposium on the Biology of Management of Coregonid Fishes	AUG 26-29, 2002	Rovaniemi, FINLAND					Population size and fishing yield of coregonids has considerably diminished in many central European lakes where nutrient concentration, in particular phosphorus, has fallen to oligotrophic levels. In re-oligotrophicated Lake Lucerne, apart from slower growth, reduction in year class strength of the slow growing form of lake whitefish was identified as the major cause for decreasing yield. Stocking of take whitefish larvae could not counteract this process. It was, therefore, hypothesised that larval mortality of lake whitefish, both from stocking and natural reproduction, had increased during re-oligotrophication because of food shortage during the early larval phase. Feeding experiments in aquaria with newly hatched lake whitefish larvae from Lake Lucerne, and using various concentrations of Artemia salina and zooplankton, showed a clear relationship between food concentration and mortality over the first 34 days. Elevated mortality of 40% or more resulted from food concentration of 20 zooplankton organisms per litre or fewer. Analysis of zooplankton data from Lake Lucerne indicated that concentration of zooplankton organisms usable by the whitefish larvae in late winter and spring was much lower in the years after 1984 than before. This might explain, at least in part, why year class strength and yield of the slow growing form of lake whitefish has decreased during re-oligotrophication of Lake Lucerne.

Dynamics of pelagic mucilage produced by the invasive, cyclotelloid diatom, Lindavia intermedia, in oligotrophic lakes of New Zealand	PLOS WATER												Marine pelagic mucilages (e.g., marine snow) have been reported to a greater extent than their lacustrine counterparts. A pelagic mucilage primarily comprised of chitin secretions from the invasive centric diatom, Lindavia intermedia, has been reported since the early 2000s, primarily from large, oligotrophic pre-alpine lakes of the South Island of New Zealand. To better understand the factors related to mucilage abundance, we monitored its abundance as well as factors potentially related to mucilage production over time in four mucilage-afflicted lakes. Temporal mucilage dynamics were episodic, with peaks in abundance occurring during any season, but most often during summer and autumn. Chitin was confirmed to be an important component of the mucilage, but the chitin content varied between 1 and 12% of the mucilage dry mass in the lakes. An RT-qPCR assay for chitin synthase gene overexpression in L. intermedia showed that overexpression occurred in summer and autumn, often when peaks in mucilage abundance also occurred. A correlation between mucilage and phytoplankton abundance was only observed in one of the lakes. Both dissolved reactive and total phosphorus concentrations were often below analytical detection limits in these lakes. Nitrate concentrations were also low and showed negative correlations with mucilage abundance. This suggests either that the secrection of chitinous mucilage by L. intermedia significantly depleted the available N in the water column or that mucilage facilitated N uptake by L. intermedia and/or other microorganisms associated with the mucilage. Pelagic mucilage in New Zealand lakes shares many characteristics of other conspicuous mucilage phenomena, including lake snow and marine snow. While our correlational analyses revealed some relationships and associations with mucilage abundance, the strengths of these were quite variable, indicating that as yet unstudied mucilage loss prolikely also play important roles in regulating mucilage abundance.

J	Ragneborn-Tough, L; Pybus, MJ; Pybus, C				Ragneborn-Tough, L; Pybus, MJ; Pybus, C			A hydrographic study of Lough Bunny, Co. Clare	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												Lough Bunny is a permanent lake in a karstic limestone area of County Glare in the west of Ireland. A survey of the lake was carried out from November 1992 to October 1993. The maximum depth recorded was 14m and the mean depth was 2.7m. The lake has no riverine inflow or outflow but is fed from springs and drains through sinkholes at the northern end of the lake. Studies by other workers have shown that this water discharges into the Rockvale river. Accordingly, Lough Bunny should be considered as part of Hydrometric Area number 29, the Galway Bay South East catchment. Pronounced seasonal variations in lake level, conductivity, alkalinity and pH were noted during 1992 and 1993. Median values for conductivity, alkalinity and pH were 324 muS cm(-1), 2.85meq dm(-3) and 8.06, respectively. Highest values were recorded during the winter months, suggesting flushing of karst aquifers into the lake, and lowest values were recorded during the summer months. Hardness ranged from 195mg CaCO3 dm(-3) to 250mg CaCO3 dm(-3). An estimate of the heat budget (3.2kcal cm(-2)) was similar to values found for lakes in the same area, but unlike the other lakes, Lough Bunny was always well mixed and did not develop any thermal stratification during the study period. Oxygen saturation was generally close to 100% throughout the lake.																			0791-7945					DEC	1999	99B	3					191	196																WOS:000166348000003

ERs of (+)alpha-HCH/(-)alpha-HCH for Lake Ontario surface and deep water samples were similar and averaged 0.85 +/- 0.02 as compared with a value of 1.00 for the alpha-HCH standard. Higher ERs were observed in water samples from the Niagara River (0.91 +/- 0.02) and from precipitation (1.00 +/- 0.01). Air samples of alpha-HCH measured at 10 m above the lake show a seasonal variability with values near 1.00 in spring and fall and minimum values in individual samples near 0.90 in summer. A simple air-water gas transfer model demonstrates that enantiomeric ratios <1.0 in air are derived from equilibration of the air with the water during transport of the air mass over the lake. Based on the measured ERs, it is calculated that as much as 60% of the alpha-HCH in air above Lake Ontario was derived from the lake itself. These results strongly support the need for overwater air measurements to provide better estimates of air-water gas transfer fluxes of persistent organic pollutants.

J	Hulden, L				Hulden, Lena			The first Finnish malariologist, Johan Haartman, and the discussion about malaria in 18th century Turku, Finland	MALARIA JOURNAL												After the Great Northern War in 1721, Sweden ceased to be an important military power. Instead, the kingdom concentrated on developing science. Swedish research got international fame with names as Carolus Linnaeus, Pehr Wargentin and Anders Celsius. Medical research remained limited and malaria was common especially in the coastal area and along the shores of the big lakes. Already in the beginning of the 18(th) century Swedish physicians recommended Peruvian bark as medication and they also emphasized that bleeding or blood-letting a malaria patient was harmful. Although malaria was a common disease in the kingdom, the situation was worst in the SW-part of Finland which consisted of the town of Turku and a large archipelago in the Baltic. The farmers had no opportunity to get modern healthcare until Johan Haartman was appointed district physician in 1754. To improve the situation he wrote a medical handbook intended for both the farmers and for persons of rank. Haartman's work was first published 1759 and he discussed all the different cures and medications. His aim was to recommend the best ones and warn against the harmful. His first choice was Peruvian bark, but he knew that the farmers could not afford it. Haartman was appointed professor in medicine at the Royal Academy of Turku in 1765. The malaria situation in Finland grew worse in the 1770's and Haartman analysed the situation. He found the connection between the warm summers and the spring epidemics next year. In a later thesis, Haartman analysed the late summer/early autumn malaria epidemics in the archipelago. Althouh Haartman did not know the connection between malaria and the vector, he gave astute advice and encouraged the farmers to build their cottages in windy places away from the shallow bays in which the Anopheles females hatched. Haartman died in 1788. After his death malaria research in Turku declined. His medical handbook would not be replaced until 1844.																				1475-2875				FEB 15	2011	10								43	10.1186/1475-2875-10-43	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-10-43								21324104					WOS:000288813700002

Bilal; Barkay, Tamar			Contribution of Coexisting Sulfate and Iron Reducing Bacteria to Methylmercury Production in Freshwater River Sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We investigated microbial methylmercury (CH3Hg) production in sediments from the South River (SR), VA, an ecosystem contaminated with industrial mercury (Hg). Potential Hg methylation rates in samples collected at nine sites were low in late spring and significantly higher in late summer. Demethylation of (CH3Hg)-C-14 was dominated by (CH4)-C-14 production in spring, but switched to producing mostly (CO2)-C-14 in the summer. Fine-grained sediments originating from the erosion of river banks had the highest CH3Hg concentrations and were potential hot spots for both methylation and demethylation activities. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes of cDNA recovered from sediment RNA extracts indicated that at least three groups of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and one group of iron-reducing bacteria (IRB), potential Hg methylators, were active in SR sediments. SRB were confirmed as a methylating guild by amendment experiments showing significant sulfate stimulation and molybdate inhibition of methylation in SR sediments. The addition of low levels of amorphous iron(III) oxyhydroidde significantly stimulated methylation rates, suggesting a role for IRB in CH3Hg synthesis. Overall, our studies suggest that coexisting SRB and IRB populations in river sediments contribute to Hg methylation, possibly by temporally and spatially separated processes.

Therefore inversion is one of the basic factors in studying the pollution of Tehran. Tehran being surrounded in an arch-shaped space of western and south eastern currents doesn't have an effective refining quality, and thus Tehran's weather is still and static and consequently this situation Leads to dangerous phenomena called temperature inversion. In this study, firstly the statistics of Tehran's inversion during months of fall and spring season were provided on a daily basis from 2006 to 2009 for a statistical period using meteorology organization's data. In order to classify the pressure, we used operative analysis. The results show that, the temperature inversion. Was ongoing in Tehran at the time the research was being done in all the seasons of the same year in which the most largest circumference of temperature inversion was seen in fall and winter and the most largest circumference was seen in November an January. Also, among the patterns related to the simeltanous mass. Above Iran's north east (above Aral lake) as well as the north west and east of turkey, the pattern related to high pressur zagros had the most intense stability compare to the rest of the other systems and normally out of these systems Siberia's high pressur stability has been greater compare to other systems and when it accompanies the high-pressure part of Iran it's intensity gets greater.

A total of 21,203 helminths was retrieved from the GITs of 1,284 lake whitefish. Approximately 42% (SE = 1.4%) of the examined lake whitefish were infected with at least 1 helminth species in their GIT, with a mean intensity of 39.4 worms/fish (SE = 0.3) and a mean abundance of 16.4 worms/fish (SE = 0.1). Collected helminths appeared to be generalists and consisted of 2 phyla (Acanthocephala and Cestoda) and 5 species (Acanthocephalus dirus, Neoechinorhynchus tumidus, Echinorhynchus salmonis, Cyathocephalus truncatus, and Bothriocephalus sp.). Lake whitefish from Lake Huron on average had greater infection prevalences, abundances, and intensities than did fish from Lake Michigan. Infection parameters for each of the helminth species generally followed the same pattern observed for the combined data. Acanthocephalus dims was the most prevalent and abundant helminth in lake whitefish GITs, although intensity of infection was the greatest for C. truncatus. Helminth infection parameters often peaked in the spring while diversity was greatest in the winter samples. There was substantial temporal variability in helminth infections with prevalences, abundances, and intensities often fluctuating widely on consecutive sampling occasions. Analysis of the GIT helminth community composition suggested that 3 (Big Bay de Noc, De Tour Village, and Cheboygan) of the 4 primary spawning sites, overall, had similar community compositions. The reason for the observed spatial and temporal variability in the lake whitefish GIT helminth infections remains to be elucidated. The findings of this study represent the most comprehensive parasitological study ever conducted on lake whitefish in the Great Lakes and will provide valuable information for future comparisons.

J	González, MJ; Downing, A				González, MJ; Downing, A			Mechanisms underlying amphipod responses to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion and implications for fish-amphipod interactions	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We examined mechanisms underlying increased amphipod abundance after zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) invaded Lake Erie. We conducted field substrate preference experiments to test the hypotheses that amphipods prefer (i) high-complexity substrates over low-complexity substrates and (or) (ii) substrates with high mussel feces and pseudofeces deposition over substrates with low deposition. We measured amphipod preference for bare rock, live mussels, and dead mussels in spring (May 1996) and summer (July and August 1995, June and August 1996). Habitat complexity affected amphipod habitat preference, and preference varied seasonally. In spring, amphipod density was highest on dead mussels, but the response was highly variable. In midsummer (June and July), amphipods showed no substrate preference. In late summer (August), amphipods consistently preferred high-complexity mussel substrates. Amphipods never preferred low-complexity substrates. We also evaluated effects of zebra mussel presence on fish-amphipod interactions in laboratory feeding trials. We tested the hypothesis that mussel presence decreases bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) predation on amphipods. Predation by bluegill but not yellow perch was significantly lowered by mussel presence. Our results support the hypothesis that the increase in amphipods upon zebra mussel invasion is due to increased habitat complexity, possibly by reducing predation risk. However, the effects of zebra mussel on fish-amphipod interactions depended on predator species.					, Amy/ACB-1824-2022														0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1999	56	4					679	685		10.1139/cjfas-56-4-679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-4-679													WOS:000081027900014

The gradients observed in distribution of dissolved and particulate material from the surface to 400 m did not vary greatly from summer to winter, even though the water temperature at the Feb. sampling time was almost isothermal.

J	MUNGER, JW				MUNGER, JW			CHEMISTRY OF ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATION IN THE NORTH-CENTRAL UNITED-STATES - INFLUENCE OF SULFATE, NITRATE, AMMONIA AND CALCAREOUS SOIL PARTICULATES	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The supply of alkaline soil dust and gaseous NH3 available to neutralize anthropogenic acids in the atmosphere controls the acidity of precipitation in the north central USA. Major ions and trace metals were determined in precipitation-event and snow-core samples from sites along a 600 km transect from the North Dakota prairie to the forests of northeastern Minnesota, collected during April 1978-June 1979. Acidity increased 4-fold from west to east as the effect of alkaline dust and NH3 decreased with increasing distance from the cultivated prairie; Ca and Mg2+ decreased 2- to 3-fold across the transect. Minimum concentrations of NH4+ and SO42- were observed at Itasca, the central site. Natural emissions of these elements were important in the west, while anthropogenic emissions were responsible for the higher concentrations in the east. Wet deposition of H+ decreased 8-fold and deposition of NO3- and SO42- decreased 1.5-2-fold from Hovland in the east to Tewaukon in the west. Wet deposition of the metal cations increased from Hovland to Tewaukon. Dry deposition following a similar trend. Winter snow cover and freezing temperatures, which decreased airborne soil dust and the evolution of NH3 form the prairie soils, led to an increase in precipitation acidity at all sites. The acid increase was accompanied by a decrease in alkaline metal cations, especially Ca2+ and in NH4+. At Hovland SO42+ and NO3- also increased during the winter. The occurrence of snow events at Tewaukon that were appreciably more acid than the snowpack accumulated there indicated that snow was neutralized after it fell by alkaline dust entrained in resuspended snow or deposited separately. Winter inputs of acid were especially important because they were released during a short period in the spring. Over half of the acid input at Hovland occurred during the winter. Precipitation inputs of P and N probably benefited nutrient-poor ecosytems in the north central United States. Acid precipitation at Hovland approached levels known to cause adverse effects in sensitive regions. The geology of northeastern Minnesota, adjoining Ontario [Canada] and northern Wisconsin was similar to that in areas where lake acidification and losses of fish populations had occurred, so that such problems may eventually occur in central North America.

However, for some local tasks, it is important to assess the contribution of a hydroelectric power plant (HPP) to various parameters of the nearest water environment, for example, mortality of zooplankton, transfer of suspended matter and phytoplankton, formation of secondary deposits, methane emissions, spatial features of stratification, etc. An example of such studies is the present paper. It is based on unique data of complex measurements of hydrophysical, hydrooptical, hydrobiological, and hydrochemical water parameters, as well as methane fluxes, that were collected at the Gorky Reservoir nearby a HPP in the spring, summer, and autumn of 2022. Preliminary correlations between these parameters were obtained. The results are useful for the correct interpretation of satellite images of inland waters, quantitative description of HPPs' influence on the water environment, knowledge of the main patterns of transformation of aquatic organism communities under conditions of runoff regulation, determination of water quality by hydrobiological parameters, development of mechanisms for improving the ecological state of water bodies, and accounting spatial heterogeneity of methane flows from the surface of the reservoir.

J	Bizic-Ionescu, M; Amann, R; Grossart, HP				Bizic-Ionescu, Mina; Amann, Rudolf; Grossart, Hans-Peter			Massive Regime Shifts and High Activity of Heterotrophic Bacteria in an Ice-Covered Lake	PLOS ONE												In winter 2009/10, a sudden under-ice bloom of heterotrophic bacteria occurred in the seasonally ice-covered, temperate, deep, oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (Germany). Extraordinarily high bacterial abundance and biomass were fueled by the breakdown of a massive bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae after ice formation. A reduction in light resulting from snow coverage exerted a pronounced physiological stress on the cyanobacteria. Consequently, these were rapidly colonized, leading to a sudden proliferation of attached and subsequently of free-living heterotrophic bacteria. Total bacterial protein production reached 201 mg C L-1 d(-1), ca. five times higher than spring-peak values that year. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis at high temporal resolution showed pronounced changes in bacterial community structure coinciding with changes in the physiology of the cyanobacteria. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that during breakdown of the cyanobacterial population, the diversity of attached and free-living bacterial communities were reduced to a few dominant families. Some of these were not detectable during the early stages of the cyanobacterial bloom indicating that only specific, well adapted bacterial communities can colonize senescent cyanobacteria. Our study suggests that in winter, unlike commonly postulated, carbon rather than temperature is the limiting factor for bacterial growth. Frequent phytoplankton blooms in ice-covered systems highlight the need for year-round studies of aquatic ecosystems including the winter season to correctly understand element and energy cycling through aquatic food webs, particularly the microbial loop. On a global scale, such knowledge is required to determine climate change induced alterations in carbon budgets in polar and temperate aquatic systems.					; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Bizic, Mina/AAC-4802-2022; Amann, Rudolf/C-6534-2014	Bizic, Mina/0000-0002-6870-4018; Amann, Rudolf/0000-0002-0846-7372													1932-6203					NOV 24	2014	9	11							e113611	10.1371/journal.pone.0113611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0113611								25419654					WOS:000346766900057
J	Hu, JF; Zhou, HD; Peng, PA; Spiro, B				Hu, Jianfang; Zhou, Haoda; Peng, Ping'an; Spiro, Baruch			Seasonal variability in concentrations and fluxes of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers in Huguangyan Maar Lake, SE China: Implications for the applicability of the MBT-CBT paleotemperature proxy in lacustrine settings	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are increasingly used for paleoclimate studies of marine and lacustrine environments. Although GDGT-based proxies have been applied to various lake environments globally, little is known about the distribution of GDGTs in lakes in subtropical South China, which are mainly controlled by the East Asian monsoonal system. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of GDGTs in Huguangyan Maar Lake (HML) in order to examine their characteristics as paleoclimate proxies in subtropical South China. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the water column was sampled monthly over a one year period at three different depths. Sediment traps were deployed simultaneously at the same locations and settling particles were collected monthly over a one year period too. In order to identify the sources of GDGTs in HML, lake bottom sediments and soil samples from the catchment were collected. The distribution and abundance of GDGTs in all samples were determined and GDGT-based temperatures were calculated. The concentrations and fluxes of GDGTs of settling particles in HML were dominated by branched GDGTs, with a minor contribution of isoprenoid homologues. The maximum concentrations and fluxes of branched GDGTs occurred during the winter months, when the water column was well mixed due to the strong East Asian winter monsoon. Also, maximal concentrations and fluxes of branched GDGTs were observed at the deeper water mass. These observations suggest that in situ production of branched GDGTs takes place mainly in the deeper part of the water column and/or at the sediment-water interface, but may be influenced by seasonal variability in the primary production in the shallower water mass of HML. The temperatures calculated from the methylation of branched tetraethers (MBT) and the cyclization ratio of branched tetraethers (CBT) of SPM and settling particles were lower than local air temperature (AT) during spring and summer when the water column was in thermal stratification, and were higher than AT during fall and winter when the water column was isothermal. However, the MBT-CBT based temperatures were in good agreement with AT on an annual time scale. Therefore they can be used as a proxy of local air temperature. Furthermore, the variations in concentration and flux of GDGTs are synchronous with the East Asian monsoon annual cycle. The overall amplitude of the estimated monthly temperature is however smaller than that of the measured air temperature. The mean MBT-CBT based temperature estimates (23.4 +/- 0.6 degrees C) of lake bottom sediments for that one year period agree with the local average mean air temperature (23.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C) for the preceding 45 years, providing further support to the reliability of this proxy and the interpretation of the results. Both long term stratification and mixing events in water column might present a challenge to the application of branched GDGT-based paleoenvironmental proxies in lakes. The present study reveals that GDGTs in lakes within the area influenced by the East Asian monsoon have a considerable potential for paleoclimatic studies but it is important to determine the location and nature of the sources of GDGTs sampled in lacustrine environments prior to their interpretation as paleoclimatic indicators. More generally, this study identifies factors which have to be considered in order to obtain reliable palaeotemperature data from GDGTs in lacustrine settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to determine the seasonal abundances and dynamics of total Actinobacteria (probe HGC69a) and the three actinobacterial subclusters acI, acI-A, and lacI-B (probes AcI-852, AcI-840-1, and AcI-840-2). Seasonal means of total Actinobacteria abundances in the epilimnia of the lakes varied from 13 to 36%, with maximum values of 30 to 58%, of all DAPI (4',6'-diamidino-2-phenyindole)stained cells. Around 80% of total Actinobacteria belonged to the acI cluster. The two subclusters acI-A and acI-B accounted for 60 to 91% of the acI cluster and showed seasonal means of 49% (acI-B) and 23% (acI-A) in relation to the acI cluster. Total Actinobacteria and members of the clusters acI and acI-B showed distinct seasonal changes in their absolute abundances, with maxima in late spring and fall/winter. In eight clone libraries constructed from the lakes, a total of 76 actinobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were identified from a total of 1.77 clones. The majority of the Actinobacteria sequences belonged to the acI and acIV cluster. Several new clusters and subclusters were found (acSTL, scB1-4, and acIVA-D). The majority of all obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences are distinct from those of already-cultured freshwater Actinobacteria.

J	Huan, SH; Xiao, CW; Feng, ZM				Huan, Songhua; Xiao, Chiwei; Feng, Zhiming			Unravelling mystery of lake color changes on the Tibetan Plateau: From mechanisms to prediction	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Lake color plays a crucial role in water quality monitoring, watershed ecological environment, tourism, and aesthetics, particularly in plateau areas. However, the patterns and mechanisms of lake color changes are still poorly understood. This study analyzed the seasonal and spatial changes of lake color (represented by Forel-Ule water color index changes) and employed machine learning models to evaluate the nonlinear relationship between environmental factors and lake color changes on the Tibetan Plateau. Then predictions were made for changes under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The results revealed that the lowest Forel-Ule was observed in spring of 6.65, followed by summer of 6.57 and autumn of 6.47. The top three most important factors were average lake water depth, average lake size, and average lake elevation. When these factors were respectively exceed 9.6 m, 110.89 km2, and 4675.0 m, the Forel-Ule tended to decrease. Additionally, lake water storage, water salinity, O3, precipitation, and temperature, as well as CO2, PM2.5, and vapor pressure deficit, were also vital in determining Forel-Ule. Overall future decreasing trend was found under SSP1, SSP2, and SSP5. Lakes on the Yellow, Southern Tibet, and Western Tibet basins exhibited low Forel-Ule, with the change rate of -11.2%. Our findings provide the foundation for explaining lake color changes on the Tibetan Plateau and offers valuable insights for enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the landscape and aquatic life.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2025	178								113936	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.113936													WOS:001542510100005

Although these expectations have found support in several studies, it is not well known how terrestrial runoff and/or inputs of primary production from lakes alter these longitudinal patterns. To investigate this, we analyzed the diet of filter-feeding black fly and caddisfly larvae from 23 boreal streams, encompassing gradients in drainage area, land cover and land use, and distance to nearest upstream lake outlet. In five of these streams, we also sampled repeatedly during autumn to test if allochthony of filter feeders increases over time as new litter inputs are processed. Across sites, filter-feeder autochthony was 21.1-75.1%, did not differ between black fly and caddisfly larvae, was not positively related to drainage area, and did not decrease with distance from lakes. Instead, lake and wetland cover promoted filter-feeder autochthony independently of stream size, whereas catchment-scale forest cover and forestry reduced autochthony. Further, we found no seasonal increase in allochthony, indicating low assimilation of particles derived from autumn litter fall. Hence, catchment properties, rather than local conditions, can influence levels of autochthony in boreal streams.

JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The ice-cover period in lakes is increasingly recognized for its distinct combination of physical and biological phenomena and ecological relevance. Knowledge gaps exist where research areas of hydrodynamics, biogeochemistry and biology intersect. For example, density-driven circulation under ice coincides with an expansion of the anoxic zone, but abiotic and biotic controls on oxygen depletion have not been disentangled, and while heterotrophic microorganisms and migrating phytoplankton often thrive at the oxycline, the extent to which physical processes induce fluxes of heat and substrates that support under-ice food webs is uncertain. Similarly, increased irradiance in spring can promote growth of motile phytoplankton or, if radiatively driven convection occurs, more nutritious diatoms, but links between functional trait selection, trophic transfer to zooplankton and fish, and the prevalence of microbial versus classical food webs in seasonally ice-covered lakes remain unclear. Under-ice processes cascade into and from the ice-free season, and are relevant to annual cycling of energy and carbon through aquatic food webs. Understanding the coupling between state transitions and the reorganization of trophic hierarchies is essential for predicting complex ecosystem responses to climate change. In this interdisciplinary review we describe existing knowledge of physical processes in lakes in winter and the parallel developments in under-ice biogeochemistry and ecology. We then illustrate interactions between these processes, identify extant knowledge gaps and present (novel) methods to address outstanding questions.

It explores relationships between the sites' spatiotemporal evolutionary characteristics, human history, and the natural environment. The results indicate that the numbers and proportions of the sites, and the frequency of their occurrence, exhibited an inverted V-shaped change trend during six historical periods. The "high in the east and low in the west" spatial distribution pattern of the first three periods shifted to the one the "high in the west and low in the east" during the latter three periods, demonstrating a change in the spatial center of gravity of human activities. The sites were mainly distributed on slopes of grades 1-5, with their proportions increasing from 75% during the Spring and Autumn Period (770 BC-476 BC)-Qin Dynasty (221 BC-207 BC) to 93.75% during the Qing Dynasty-Modern period. The concentrated distribution of site elevations shifted from grades 4-8 during the Spring and Autumn Period-Qin Dynasty, and the Western Han (206 BC-8)-Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), to grades 1-4 during the latter three periods. The number of sites showed a shifting trend from high-elevation mountains and hills to low-elevation plains, and from high slopes to low slopes. In particular, the sites exhibited a special "moist" evolutionary pattern of migration from middle and upstream areas to downstream areas, as opposed to the migration pattern of sites located in typical arid areas. The study also considered factors influencing the distribution and spatiotemporal evolution of cultural sites, notably, human factors and natural factors.					wu, wenjie/HKM-3623-2023; shi, hui/JNS-2378-2023; Wang, Fang/AAG-4654-2020														1009-637X	1861-9568				SEP	2015	25	9					1089	1108		10.1007/s11442-015-1221-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-015-1221-8													WOS:000357501300005

Studying the Effect of Chulyshman River Water on the Thermohydrodynamic Processes in Teletskoye Lake in Summer Months	WATER RESOURCES												The effect of the Chulyshman River on the formation of the density stratification pattern of Lake Teletskoye in summer is considered. The relevance of this problem is determined by the importance of studying the specific features of the transport processes of solutes and pollutants under the conditions of thermocline and thermal bar formation and water renewal in the lake. The above-mentioned problems are solved using mathematical modeling methods and field observation data. To consider thermohydrodynamic processes in deep Lake Teletskoye and the Chulyshman River, computer models were built based on the open Delft3D package: an improved 3D model was developed for the lake, and the flow of the Chulyshman River in its mouth area was described based on a planar (2DH) model. The 3D and 2DH models were matched at the inlet section to Lake Teletskoye. Field observations of the spatial thermal structure of the lake were carried out in the summer-autumn months of 2010-2023. The main results of the work performed include the revealed complex picture of density stratification and density currents in Lake Teletskoye during the period of summer heating of the reservoir as well as the main factors of its formation; features of the distribution of waters of the Chulyshman River in the lake in the summer months.

Exploring the soundscape of small freshwater lakes	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Monitoring freshwater ecosystems using passive acoustics is a largely unexplored approach, despite having the potential to yield information about the biological, geological and anthropogenic activity of a lake or river system. The state of Minnesota, located in the upper Midwest of the USA and nicknamed 'land of 10,000 lakes', provides an interesting case study for soundscape research, because lakes offer ecological, recreational and economic value throughout the area. The underwater soundscape was monitored at fifteen small lakes < 10 km(2) on representative days in winter (during 100% ice cover) and summer 2018 using a hydrophone suspended 2 m below the water's surface. Median broadband sound pressure level (100-12,000 Hz) was significantly lower in winter (57.2 dB re 1 mu Pa) compared to summer (66.7 dB re 1 mu Pa), possibly because low frequency wind sounds were reduced in winter. Recordings suggest small freshwater lakes in Minnesota have a relatively pristine soundscape, where vocalizing aquatic animals may hold acoustic niches. However, sound from anthropogenic activity was also present in the study lakes. Ice auger and motorboat sound increased the intensity of the soundscape by 10 dB and overlapped the frequency range (300-1000 Hz) of biological sounds in the environment, that may be important to aquatic life. Understanding current baseline sound levels in ecologically significant freshwater lakes, like those in this study, is the first step in determining any potential consequences of anthropogenic sound. Moving forward, baseline sound levels provide vital evidence for scientists and governing bodies to make proactive decisions for soundscape conservation.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				JAN	2020	55								101018	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.101018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.101018													WOS:000510985900001
J	Garcia, PE; Gerea, M; Diéguez, MC				Garcia, Patricia E.; Gerea, Marina; Dieguez, Maria C.			Natural levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in deep clear South temperate lakes: Field and laboratory evidence of photo- and biotic production	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a ubiquitous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aquatic systems and is produced mainly in surface water by the interaction of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Andean Patagonian lakes are ultraoligotrophic, clear systems with extended photic zones (similar to 40 m), and are exposed to challenging UVR levels due to their lati-altitudinal situation and extremely low DOC levels. This investigation describes the seasonal levels of H2O2 in relation to DOC quality in the water column of lakes Moreno East (ME) and Moreno West (MW), two deep (ca. 100 m), ultraoligotrophic, low-DOC (<0.7 mg L-1) systems of Andean Patagonia. H2O2 concentrations recorded in the lakes were below 60 nM, ranging from similar to 3 to similar to 60 nM in Lake ME and from similar to 5 to similar to 35 nM in Lake MW. Inmost of the samples of both lakes, the H2O2 levels were higher in the photic zone (surface to 30-40 m) than the aphotic zone (from 30-40 m to 90-100m), particularly in summer samples. Laboratory experiments evaluated the abiotic (photochemical) and biotic (microbial) production of H2O2 in seasonal (summer, autumn) samples which varied DOM quality due to lake(ME, MW) and depth (photic and aphotic lake layers) provenance. Abiotic and biotic production of H2O2 attained higher levels in summer samples from the photic zones of both lakes. Humic DOM from deep layers (particularly from summer samples) was more susceptible to both photo- and bio-degradation than DOM from upper lake layers, which was characterized by stronger signs of degradation and progress in diagenesis.

The Rabien mire is a raised bog located on the edge of the Lodz Agglomeration in Central Poland. After peat extraction, many ponds remained in the Rabien area. During the growing season in 2012, adult chironomids were collected by a light trap and a hand net near one of the excavation ponds. The phenology of adult flight period was documented from April to November. Thirty-one species were recorded and assigned to one of five phenology groups. Three parameters reflecting duration of daytime and weather conditions, i.e. air temperature, air humidity, were found to covary significantly with the observed flight periods. Taxa emerging in the spring may be classified as cold-adapted and those collected in the summer only as preferring higher air temperature. Emergence in late summer was related to a shorter duration of daytime.

Moreover, the TP provides a key channel for substance transport between the troposphere and the stratosphere. This study reviews recent advances in research regarding land-atmosphere coupling processes over the TP. The TP experiences climate warming and wetting. Climate warming has caused glacier retreat, permafrost degradation, and a general increase in vegetation density, while climate wetting has led to a significant increase in the number of major lakes, primarily through increased precipitation. Local and regional climates are affected by interactions between the land and the atmosphere. Namely, the TP drives surface pollutants to the upper troposphere in an Asian summer monsoon (ASM) anticyclone circulation, before spreading to the lower stratosphere. Further, the thermal forcing of the TP plays an essential role in the ASM. TP forcing can modulate hemispheric-scale atmospheric circulations across all seasons. The TP interacts with remote oceans through a forced atmospheric response and is substantially affected by the evolution of the Earth's climate via promoting Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and eliminating Pacific meridional overturning circulation. The extensive influence of the TP is facilitated by its coupling with the ASM in the summer; whereas its winter influence on climate mainly occurs through Rossby waves. The observed increasing trends of temperature and precipitation over the TP are projected to continue throughout the 21st century.

Of these, subsurface conduits that facilitate concentrated, heterogeneous flow are challenging to resolve geologically and geophysically. This is especially the case in evaporite karst systems, such as those present on the shores of the Dead Sea, where rapid geomorphological changes are linked to a fall in base level by over 35 m since 1967. Here we combine field observations, remote-sensing analysis, and multiple geophysical surveying methods (shear wave reflection seismics, electrical resistivity tomography, ERT, self-potential, SP, and groundpenetrating radar, GPR) to investigate the nature of subsurface groundwater flow and its interaction with hypersaline Dead Sea water on the rapidly retreating eastern shoreline, near Ghor Al-Haditha in Jordan. Remote-sensing data highlight links between the evolution of surface stream channels fed by groundwater springs and the development of surface subsidence patterns over a 25-year period. ERT and SP data from the head of one groundwater-fed channel adjacent to the former lakeshore show anomalies that point to concentrated, multidirectional water flow in conduits located in the shallow subsurface (< 25 m depth). ERT surveys further inland show anomalies that are coincident with the axis of a major depression and that we interpret as representing subsurface water flow. Low-frequency GPR surveys reveal the limit between unsaturated and saturated zones (< 30 m depth) surrounding the main depression area. Shear wave seismic reflection data nearly 1 km further inland reveal buried paleochannels within alluvial fan deposits, which we interpret as pathways for groundwater flow from the main wadi in the area towards the springs feeding the surface streams. Finally, simulations of density-driven flow of hypersaline and under- saturated groundwaters in response to base-level fall perform realistically if they include the generation of karst conduits near the shoreline. The combined approaches lead to a refined conceptual model of the hydrological and geomorphological processes developed at this part of the Dead Sea, whereby matrix flow through the superficial aquifer inland transitions to conduit flow nearer the shore where evaporite deposits are encountered. These conduits play a key role in the development of springs, stream channels and subsidence across the study area.					; Meyer, Rena/KYQ-6180-2024; Al-Halbouni, Djamil/CAH-1363-2022; Meyer, Rena/E-7842-2015	Watson, Robert Alban/0000-0002-7086-3237; Holohan, Eoghan/0000-0002-5930-6712; Dahm, Torsten/0000-0001-6432-7422; comas, xavier/0000-0001-8141-6195; Al-Halbouni, Djamil/0000-0003-2254-3914; Meyer, Rena/0000-0001-9127-8670; Krawczyk, Charlotte M./0000-0002-5505-6293													1027-5606	1607-7938				JUN 16	2021	25	6					3351	3395		10.5194/hess-25-3351-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3351-2021													WOS:000664013000004

The mean concentrations of Hg data from those widely dispersed monitoring stations were computed to be ( 1) 1.58 +/- 0.23, 1.69 +/- 0.32, and 1.93 +/- 0.44 ( three sites in CGL), ( 2) 5.06 +/- 2.46 ng m(-3) (SEL), ( 3) 1.55 +/- 0.41 (ALT), and ( 4) 1.76 +/- 0.31 (MH). Intersite relationships were investigated among all different stations using the data groups divided into different temporal intervals. The analysis of diurnal variation patterns of Hg indicated differences in regional source/sink characteristics, with increasing amplitudes of variability toward areas under the strong influence of anthropogenic sources. When the analysis was made over different seasons, the patterns contrasted greatly between the Arctic and the other areas. It was found that the relative enhancement of Hg concentrations was dominant during winter/spring in most areas due to direct or indirect influences of anthropogenic emissions. However, the pattern for the Arctic area was distinguished pronouncedly from others with the spring minimum and summer maximum both of which reflect the potent effects of mercury depletion phenomenon (MDP). By contrast, no long-term trend, either being an increase or decrease, was evident from any of the stations during each respective study period. Although our initial attempts to examine the distribution characteristics of Hg analyzed by different scientific groups were successful, we feel that these efforts should be continued further to extend the compatibility of the global database of Hg.

In this study, an ensemble of 12 regional climate projections is used to simulate the inflow to Lake Vanern by the HBV hydrological model. By using distribution based scaling of the climate model output, all projections can accurately reproduce the annual cycle of mean monthly inflows for the period 1961-1990 as simulated using HBV with observed temperature and precipitation ('HBVobs'). Significant changes towards higher winter inflow and a reduced spring flood were found when comparing the period 1991-2008 to 1961-1990 in the HBVobs simulations and the ability of the regional projections to reproduce these changes varied. The main uncertainties in the projections for 1991-2008 were found to originate from the global climate model used, including its initialization, and in one case, the emissions scenario, whereas the regional climate model used and its resolution showed a smaller influence. The projections that most accurately reproduce the recent change suggest that the current trends in the winter and spring inflows will continue over the period 2009-2030.

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF ORGANIC MATTER FROM AN URBAN LAKE	4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE WATER RESOURCES AND WETLANDS	Water Resources and Wetlands				4th International Conference on Water Resources and Wetlands	SEP 05-09, 2018	Tulcea, ROMANIA	Romanian Limnogeog Assoc				Fluorescence spectroscopy was shown to characterize aquatic organic matter and to determine its impact on water quality from various sources. Past studies proposed this technique as an excellent tool for water quality continuous monitoring due to its advantages: rapid measurements, high sensitivity and selectivity, requires small quantities of sample with little or no sample preparation. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to monitor different types of water systems; however, no complex study was undertaken to determine the spatial and temporal variability of urban lakes. These lakes are highly susceptible to contamination with surface runoff, illegal wastewaters discharge and effluent discharge, which lead to increased eutrophication and to a decrease of the ecological health status. This study aimed to develop a preliminary database with fluorescence spectra of samples collected from Morii Lake (44 degrees 27'20 '' N, 26 degrees 01'31 '' E, Bucharest, Romania) over a period of 6 months, in 2017. Results showed a reduction, from spring to summer, in the fluorescence intensity of the organic matter microbial fraction. The values increased towards autumn. The humic fraction of the organic matter presented an opposite trend, depending on the quantity of precipitation, which lead to increased surface runoff release in the summer. Fluorescence indices, such as the humification index, the biological index, the F450/500 ratio and the T/C ratio, calculated based on the fluorescence intensity at specific wavelength ranges, were used to provide a complex characterization of the organic matter from Morii Lake samples. These parameters, together with standard water quality parameters, were further used to develop a prediction model for Morii Lake water quality. Although a good correlation coefficient was obtained between the estimated and measured values, a larger database is required in order to obtain a solid prediction tool.

Seasonal Dynamics of Dissolved Methane in Lakes of the Mackenzie Delta and the Role of Carbon Substrate Quality	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Dissolved CH4 among lake waters of the Mackenzie River Delta was tracked in 2014 to assess how river-to-lake connection times, plus carbon substrate quantity and quality, affects the patterns and dynamics of CH4. An under-ice survey of 29 lakes, three open-water surveys of 43 lakes, and weekly surveys of 6 lakes revealed that CH4 among lake-waters ranged from very high concentrations at the end of winter, with highest concentrations linked to shortest annual river connection times, to considerably lower concentrations as open water progressed, with a limited concentration range among lakes by late summer. Lakes most strongly affected by thermokarst varied irregularly from this pattern and did not have the highest CH4 concentrations. CH4 among lake waters was generally related to measures of carbon substrate quantity, where relations with macrophyte biomass and dissolved organic carbon in lake water were statistically stronger than % organic matter within the lake sediments. CH4 was also directly related to the molecular weight (a[250]:a[365]) of dissolved organic matter at the end of winter, but was inversely related to this measure during open water. Carbon quality per se, after accounting for differences in carbon quantity (macrophyte biomass, dissolved organic carbon concentrations, or organic content of lake sediments), appears to play a significant role in controlling CH4 concentrations among the lake waters, particularly during winter ice cover. Carbon quality in lake sediments and of dissolved organic matter in winter lake waters appears to be as important as thermokarst augmentation of carbon quantity for enhancing methanogenesis in this lake-rich Arctic system.					; Tank, Suzanne/I-4816-2012	Cunada, Christopher/0000-0001-8320-6271; Tank, Suzanne/0000-0002-5371-6577													2169-8953	2169-8961				FEB	2018	123	2					591	609		10.1002/2017JG004047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JG004047													WOS:000427478500018
J	Betts, AK				Betts, Alan K.			Vermont Climate Change Indicators	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY												Climate change indicators are developed for Vermont in recent decades based on the trends in freeze dates, the length of the growing season, the frozen period of small lakes, and the onset of spring. These trends, which show a consistent pattern of a warming climate in Vermont during the past 50 yr, provide useful information for climate change adaptation planning for the state. The freeze period has become shorter and the growing season for frost-sensitive plants has become longer by about 3.7 (61.1) days decade 21, the date of the last spring freeze has come earlier by 2.3 (60.7) days decade 21, and the first autumn freeze has come later by 1.5 (60.8) days decade 21. The frozen period for small lakes, which depends on mean temperatures over longer periods, has decreased faster by 6.9 (61.5) days decade 21. Lake freeze-up has occurred later by 3.9 (61.1) days decade 21, while ice-out has come earlier by 2.9 (61.0) days decade 21. Lilac first leaf has also been coming earlier by 2.9 (60.8) days decade 21, while lilac first bloom has advanced more slowly, by 1.6 (60.6) days decade 21. The first leaf of Vermont lilacs, an indicator of early spring, is closely correlated with the ice-out of the small reference lake, Stile's Pond, because both are related to temperatures in February-April. In the past 40 yr, the growing season for frost-sensitive plants has increased by 2 weeks, and the growing season for frost-hardy plants may have increased more.

Lake sturgeon in the Lake Winnebago system historically migrated up the Wolf River to spawn at Keshena Falls, within the current boundaries of the Menominee Reservation where, each spring, the Menominee people gathered at Keshena Falls to harvest lake sturgeon. The construction of two dams on the Wolf River downstream of Keshena Falls in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries contributed to extirpation of this species on the Menominee Reservation. The general public has had the opportunity to harvest lake sturgeon from Lake Winnebago during a winter spear fishery since 1932. Those who participate in this fishery feel as strongly about the lake sturgeon resource as do the Menominee people. Cooperation among multiple resource management agencies and the public was necessary to address the interests of both groups and at the same time ensure protection of the Winnebago system lake sturgeon population. In 1993, tribal, state, and federal representatives developed a plan to reintroduce lake sturgeon to the Menominee Reservation. The planning process was designed to involve all the various, often competing, tribal and non-tribal interests in a constructive effort to develop and implement a Menominee Reservation sturgeon rehabilitation plan that all parties could accept and endorse. The core planning group was the Menominee Reservation Lake Sturgeon Enhancement Committee which worked with the various sturgeon 'publics' to identify common sturgeon restoration goals, objectives and management strategies, and which has worked together since that time in the effort to re-establish viable lake sturgeon populations in Menominee Reservation waters. Since 1994, over 30 000 hatchery-raised lake sturgeon have been stocked in reservation lakes, and 87 Wolf River lake sturgeon have been radio-tagged and relocated upstream to reservation waters of the river. Enough mature lake sturgeon were present in this river reach in 2001 to permit spawning there for the first time in 50 years. The success of the co-management effort has been encouraging and participants are committed to the goal of establishing self-sustaining lake sturgeon populations in reservation waters.																			0175-8659					DEC	2002	18	4-6					481	485		10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00426.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00426.x													WOS:000179913400040
J	Tan, X				Tan, Xiao			Physiological and ecological characteristics in the life cycle of bloom-forming cyanobacteria	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												Freshwater lakes provide water sources for drinking, aquaculture, agricultural irrigation, and so on, but many eutrophic lakes around the world are suffered by cyanobacterial blooms. These harmful cyanobacteria (such as Microcytis, Anabaena, Aphnizomenon, and so on) are capable of nuisance growth and producing toxins, which pose serious threats to water safety and human health. Based on most of the literature, this paper reviewed the progress made in following fields: physiological and ecological characteristics of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in their annual life cycle, internal regulation mechanisms and environmental factors for blooms formation. In winter, dormant period is regarded as the continuation of cyanobacteria populations, which conserve "seed bank" for the following year. In spring, recruitment can be defined as an inoculation of overwintering cyanobacteria to the pelagic phase after growth recovery under suitable conditions. Temperature, resuspension and bioturbation had been recognized lobe the main driving factors for recruitment. Shortly after recruitment, cyanobacteria establish dominance by fast growth rate (i.e. r-type ecological strategy) and colony enlargement. Under suitable meteorological and hydrological conditions, cyanobacterial colonies aggregate and float up to form heavy blooms, which can lead to water supply crisis and ecological disaster. From late autumn, blooms disaggregate and decline. The sinking process is not only a periodic life cycle but also an irregular mechanical movement. Cyanobacteria accumulation areas in late autumn might highly related to the First occurence of blooms in the following year. The time series of bloom-forming cyanobacteria in lakes of temperate and subtropical zones could be summarized as the four-stage hypothesis, but the spatial patterns of blooms in large lakes were rarely explored. Moreover, further studies are needed to explore the threshold values of environmental factors at each stage, and compare the ecophysiological differences between cyanobacteria and other algae, which could provide valuable information for the prediction and prevention of harmful blooms, so as to establish a sound and stable lacustrine ecosystem.

To assess the relative importance of biotic (benthos) and physico-chemical factors, the mass loss rate (K) of reed leaf litter was measured at 10 sites, both in winter and in summer, in the absence ('protected' litter bags) and the presence ('unprotected' litter bags) of invertebrates. The aim was to investigate the variation in mass loss rate within the habitat and between seasons, and the role of the litter-associated invertebrate community. The experiments showed high spatial variation in decomposition rates. The spatial pattern changed with season. In summer, decomposition rates were higher than in winter: 4.4 times in the presence of invertebrates, and 2.6 times in their absence. The exclusion of invertebrates ('protected' litter bags versus 'unprotected' litter bags) led to significantly lower decomposition rates. In particular, the decomposition rate was strongly correlated with the number of gammarids, the dominant taxon in the litter bags, which are well known for their ability to feed on leaf litter. The abundance of gammarids was directly correlated to the level of dissolved oxygen and inversely correlated to the effective fetch in summer, when the spatial structure of the decomposition process was evident. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that there are seasonal and spatial differences in the rate of detritus decomposition, most likely due to changes in habitat characteristics that influence the distribution of gammarids, key-species responsible for the first steps of the leaf breakdown in Lake Geestmerambacht. The spatial dependency of the process leads to formation of heterogeneous ecological patches in which the probability of disturbance propagation may vary.						van Dokkum, Henno/0000-0002-5593-9977; Costantini, Maria Letizia/0000-0001-6242-558X; ROSSI, LORETO/0000-0001-8014-5397													0018-8158					AUG	2002	482	1-3					69	77		10.1023/A:1021295610780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021295610780													WOS:000179387500007

Changes in chill accumulation and spring frost injury risk are particularly concerning for specialty crop growers in the Midwest. Despite their importance for the industry, relatively little work has been done to assess these changes and help guide crop management strategies accordingly. We use a combination of historical observations and CMIP6 multi-model ensemble projections to assess recent and potential future changes in chill accumulation and phenology for apple in the region. Observations show increased chill accumulation in much of the Midwest over the past 70 years, and CMIP6 projections indicate continued increases through the next 70+ years. The southern Midwest is expected to lose chill, but not at a rate that would require a substantial shift to fruit cultivars with very low chill requirements. Additionally, apple full bloom estimates using the PhenoFlex model combined with CMIP6 model projections show shifts earlier in the spring for both apple phenology and spring freeze dates. We do not find any appreciable change in spring freeze injury risk by mid-century under any scenario. This study provides an important assessment of climate change impacts on specialty crops in an understudied region of the United States for non-commodity agriculture. More collaborative work is needed between scientists, practitioners, and growers to (1) assess the current and future risks to specialty crop agriculture in the Midwest that result from climate change and (2) explore viable solutions to ensure a resilient specialty crop industry in the face of changing climatic, economic, and social systems.					; Luedeling, Eike/I-3269-2019; Chen, Liang/AEX-0269-2022; Fernandez, Eduardo/V-3324-2019	Chen, Liang/0000-0003-1553-2846; Fernandez, Eduardo/0000-0002-6949-9685; Luedeling, Eike/0000-0002-7316-3631; 													0168-1923	1873-2240				JUN 1	2025	368								110532	10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110532	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110532		APR 2025											WOS:001466357300001

We used PoliHydro model to investigate hydrological regime of the basin during last 30 years, this including snow accumulation and ablation processes. Calibration of Poli-Hydro was carried out using a 10-yrs series of daily natural inflows to the reservoir during 1990-1999. Climate scenarios from Assessment Report 6 of IPCC were used as input to sketch future inflow scenarios. While no univocal trajectory is depicted for total water availability among scenarios, the decrease of snowfall would most reliably reduce spring-summer inflow and increase winter baseflow. Associated scenarios of energy production are analysed on the background of Italian energy goals for 2030-40 under the framework of NextGenerationEU, and possible adaptation policies of reservoir management are suggested. To face volatility in energy production given by deep exploitation of renewable sources, it is compelling to consider chances of installing energy storage systems. A pumped-storage facility could be implemented in the Mollaro Lake, a minor reservoir collecting water from Taio plant, to store surplus energy from renewable sources in Santa Giustina Lake.

Using 22,664 water samples from 851 boreal lakes and 64 boreal streams, taken from different water depths and during different months we found large spatial and temporal variations in pCO(2), ranging from below atmospheric equilibrium to values greater than 20,000 mu atm with a median value of 1048 mu atm for lakes (n = 11,538 samples) and 1176 mu atm for streams (n = 11,126). During the spring water mixing period in April/May, distributions of pCO(2) were not significantly different between stream and lake ecosystems (P > 0.05), suggesting that pCO(2) in spring is determined by processes that are common to lakes and streams. During other seasons of the year, however, pCO(2) differed significantly between lake and stream ecosystems (P < 0.0001). The variable that best explained the differences in seasonal pCO(2) variations between lakes and streams was the temperature difference between bottom and surface waters. Even small temperature differences resulted in a decline of pCO(2) in lake surface waters. Minimum pCO(2) values in lake surface waters were reached in July. Towards autumn pCO(2) strongly increased again in lake surface waters reaching values close to the ones found in stream surface waters. Although pCO(2) strongly increased in the upper water column towards autumn, pCO(2) in lake bottom waters still exceeded the pCO(2) in surface waters of lakes and streams. We conclude that throughout the year CO2 is concentrated in bottom waters of boreal lakes, although these lakes are typically shallow with short water retention times. Highly varying amounts of this CO2 reaches surface waters and evades to the atmosphere. Our findings have important implications for up-scaling CO2 fluxes from single lake and stream measurements to regional and global annual fluxes.					; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020; Müller, Roger/L-2062-2015; Muller, Roger Andre/L-2062-2015; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019	Rantakari, Miitta Maria/0000-0003-2335-6192; Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688; Muller, Roger Andre/0000-0003-2798-9018; 													1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2012	15	8					1295	1307		10.1007/s10021-012-9585-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-012-9585-4													WOS:000312143300007

The forcing variables are discharge, river morphology, water temperature, available light and nutrient inputs. Given the description of several algal categories, POTAMON allows to simulate algal "successions" at a particular site, as well as longitudinal changes of potamoplankton composition and biomass. The algal categories differ by their physiology, their loss rates, and their sensitivity to grazing by zooplankton. Two zooplankton categories were considered, Brachionus-like and Keratella-like. which differ by their clearance rate, their incipient limiting level, their selectivity towards phytoplankton, and their growth yield. The model simulates satisfactorily the onset and the magnitude of the phytoplankton spring bloom in the Belgian part of R. Meuse, the biomass decrease in early summer, and the autumn bloom. It also renders the major variations of algal assemblages along the river. The model allows to confirm that the main driving variables of potamoplankton dynamics in a eutrophic river are physical factors: discharge and related variables (e.g. retention time), light and temperature. In addition, the simulations confirm that the zooplankton-phytoplankton interaction may result in phytoplankton biomass fluctuations and compositional changes. POTAMON can be useful to explore plankton dynamics in a large river, and it may become a tool to test various management measures. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Insight of aerosol becomes an integral task in the process of control measures for environmental pollution. The present study provided an analysis of temporal-spatial variations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) using the MODO4 level-2 in collection 6 (C6) with the deep blue retrieval algorithm from January 2005 to December 2015 over Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China. The AOD validations between MODIS and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) were estimated by the methods of regression, correlation. Then, the periodic features and trends of AOD and angstrom exponent (AE) were explored with the wavelet transformation (WT) procedure. Further, the variations of AOD and AE spatial distribution on multi-time scales (annual, monthly and season) were demonstrated. Meantime, the sources of AOD are discussed. It was found that the daily AOD from MODIS has a strong correlation relationship (slope = 0.9838, r = 0.84) with AERONET over YRD. The variations of both AOD and AE on time series have been distinct temporal periodic (12, 6 and 4 months) characteristics, and show the decreasing trends on annual and semi-annual periods. On annual, the AOD on spatial distribution is slowly declining from the northwest towards the southeast, and the AE on spatial distribution is gradually decreasing from the northwest to the southeast and from the land to the coast. The variations both inter-annual AOD and AE on spatial distribution show the inverse trends, respectively. On monthly, the means of AOD range from minimum 0.46 in January to maximum 0.90 in July, and the variations of spatial distribution mainly occur in the north parts of Yangtze River and some scattered areas with high terrain and south coast. The means of AE range from minimum 1.13 in October to maximum 1.58 in April, and the variations of spatial distribution are mainly found in the south of Henan, the north of Jiangsu, the coast belt and the riverside of Yangtze River and the high terrain regions. On seasonality, the means of AOD reaches its maximum 0.68 in summer and minimum 0.50 in winter, and the variations of spatial distribution mainly occur in the coast belt, the north parts of Hongze Lake and the south parts with high terrain. The means of AE reaches its maximum 1.48 in spring and minimum 1.25 in autumn, and the variations of spatial distribution were shown the similarity with that of monthly.					yuan yuan, wang/JCW-0563-2023														1436-3240	1436-3259				SEP	2018	32	9					2619	2632		10.1007/s00477-018-1575-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-018-1575-4													WOS:000442996700011

Understanding the influence of climate change on the embodied energy of water supply	WATER RESEARCH												The current study aims to advance understandings on how and to what degree climate change will affect the life cycle chemical and energy uses of drinking water supply. A dynamic life cycle assessment was performed to quantify historical monthly operational embodied energy of a selected water supply system located in northeast US. Comprehensive multivariate and regression analyses were then performed to understand the statistical correlation among monthly life cycle energy consumptions, three water quality indicators (UV254, pH, and water temperature), and five climate indicators (monthly mean temperature, monthly mean maximum/minimum temperatures, total precipitation, and total snow fall). Thirdly, a calculation was performed to understand how volumetric and total life cycle energy consumptions will change under two selected IPCC emission scenarios (A2 and B1). It was found that volumetric life cycle energy consumptions are highest in winter months mainly due to the higher uses of natural gas in the case study system, but total monthly life cycle energy consumptions peak in both July and January because of the increasing water demand in summer months. Most of the variations in chemical and energy uses can be interpreted by water quality and climate variations except for the use of soda ash. It was also found that climate change might lead to an average decrease of 3-6% in the volumetric energy use of the case study system by the end of the century. This result combined with conclusions reached by previous climate versus water supply studies indicates that effects of climate change on drinking water supply might be highly dependent on the geographical location and treatment process of individual water supply systems.

Two stations were located at 11 m and one was at 23-m depth. At the 11-m stations, total pigment concentrations in the upper 0-1 cm layer were greatest in May and then declined, while seasonal changes at the 23-m station were not apparent. A high proportion of the spring influx of pigment at the 11-m depth was undegraded, indicating freshly settled material from the water column as a likely source. Sediment chlorophyll concentrations in the spring were as high as 212 .mu.g/g, but typical summer values were 1-7 .mu.g/g. Although these pelagic inputs are temporary, strong links exist between this material and benthic invertebrate distributions.																			0380-1330						1987	13	1					37	42		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71625-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71625-6													WOS:A1987H174300005

Seasonal changes in the abundance and composition of plant pigments in particulate organic carbon in the lower Mississippi and Pearl Rivers	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Plant pigments in particulate organic carbon were examined in the lower Mississippi and Pearl Rivers (U.S.), along with physical variables and nutrients to study seasonal changes in the abundance and composition of phytoplankton. Water samples were collected monthly from September 2001 to August 2003 in the lower Mississippi River (MR; no samples were taken in February 2002) and from August 2001 to July 2003 in the Pearl River (PR). High concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients, and chlorophyll a (chl a; dominated by diatoms) were observed in the lower MR. The smaller blackwater PR was characterized by lower nutrients and chl a, higher ultraviolet absorbance, and a phytoplankton biomass dominated by chlorophytes. Chl a concentrations in the lower MR was high in summer low-flow periods and also during interims of winter and spring, and did not couple with physical variables and nutrients, likely due to a combination of in situ production and inputs from reservoirs, navigation locks, and oxbow lakes in the upper MR and Missouri River. Chl a concentrations in the PR was only high in summer low-flow periods and were controlled by temperature and concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The high, diatom-dominated phytoplankton biomass in the lower MR was likely the result of decreasing TSS (increased damming in the watershed) and increasing nutrients (enhanced agricultural runoff) over the past few decades. Lower phytoplankton biomass (dominated by chlorophytes) in the PR was likely linked with intense shading by CDOM and lower availability of nutrient inputs. An increase in the relative importance of phytoplankton biomass in large turbid rivers, such as the MR, could have significant effects on the age and lability of riverine organic matter entering the ocean, the stoichiometric balance of nutrients delivered to coastal margins, and the sequestration of atmospheric CO(2) in these dynamic regions.

Total N:total P ratios in the epilimnion ranged from 19 to 220 suggesting a P dependent algal yield in the epilimnion. Approximately 90% of annual TP loading reached the lake via streamflow, and 93% of this entered during snowmelt and spring-overturn periods. Incoming water flushed the lake 2.4 times. Atmospheric loading accounted for 1.4% of annual TP load. Internal hypolimnetic TP loading occurred during summer stratification. Mean chl a for the ice-free period was 15.15 mg m-3, within the range expected for eutrophic lakes. The 1978-1979 data were used in conjunction with the Vollenweider and Kerekes (1980) model to produce a model specific for the Skinner Lake system. The model predicted mean epilimnetic TP and chl a concentrations from mean TP concentration in inlet streams and from lake water residence time during the period of spring overturn and summer stratification. The Skinner-specific model was tested in 1982 and it closely predicted observed mean epilimnetic TP and chl a during the ice-free period. This study shows that variability in lake models which average data over an annual period can be reduced by considering lake-specific seasonal variation in hydrology and external TP loading.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	122	3					231	241		10.1007/BF00018283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018283													WOS:A1985AGE3500006

Spatial and temporal patterns of vertical distribution for three planktivorous fishes in Lake Washington	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We sampled three limnetic fish species: juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) in Lake Washington to quantify species-specific patterns of diel vertical migration (DVM). Catch-per-unit-effort data analysed from 15 years of midwater trawling documented seasonal and diel differences in vertical distributions for each species. These results were consistent with the hypothesis that the patterns of DVM in Lake Washington were affected by life history, size and morphology. Sockeye salmon showed clear DVM in spring but essentially no DVM in fall, remaining in deep water, whereas three-spine sticklebacks were prevalent at the surface at night in both seasons. In fall, distribution patterns may be explained by differences in thermal performance (e.g., sticklebacks favouring warm water), but the patterns were also consistent with inter-specific differences in predation risk. Younger sockeye salmon and longfin smelt were present in greater proportions higher in the water column during dusk and night periods than older conspecifics. Compared with sockeye salmon, the greater use by three-spine sticklebacks of surface waters throughout the diel cycle during weak thermal stratification in spring was consistent with the hypothesis that sticklebacks armour reduces predation risk, but use of this warmer, metabolically beneficial stratum may also have promoted growth. This study illustrates variation in the vertical distribution of three sympatric planktivores and offers broader implications for the DVM phenomenon and applied lake ecology.

Behavioural strategy of large perch Perca fluviatilis varies between a mesotrophic and a hypereutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Behaviour of large perch Perca fluviatilis was studied in two lakes differing in environmental state i.e. mesotrophic v. hypereutrophic. A total of 20 adult perch P. fluviatilis (29-42 cm total length) in each lake were tagged with radio-transmitters, tracked and located eight times a day during six 24 h tracking periods over a year, enabling detection of differences in diel activity patterns and habitat use during summer and winter under two different environmental regimes. During summer, P. fluviatilis in the mesotrophic lake showed a distinct crepuscular activity pattern and a change from pelagic residency during daytime towards the littoral zone at night. In contrast, P. fluviatilis in the hypereutrophic lake were active during the entire diel cycle and were spread throughout the lake also during dark. During winter, crepuscular patterns of activity were seen in both lakes. Condition factor of large P. fluviatilis did not differ between the two lakes. Thus, it is suggested that P. fluviatilis in the hypereutrophic turbid lake adopted an alternative behaviour for successful foraging, being uniformly active throughout the diel cycle.

We sought to understand the Iona-term population dynamics of an important native Lake Michigan prey fish, the bloater Coregonus hoyi. Over a 38-year time series, three 10- to 15-year phases occurred (poor, excellent, and then poor recruitment) without high interannual variability within a particular phase. We used dynamic linear models to determine whether extrinsic (winter and spring temperature, alewife predator densities) or intrinsic factors (population egg production, adult condition, adult sex ratio) explained variation in recruitment. Models that included population egg production, sex ratio, winter and spring temperature, and adult bloater condition explained the most variation. Of these variables, sex ratio, which ranged from 47% to 97% female across the time series, consistently had the greatest effect: recruitment declined with female predominance. Including biomass of adult alewife predators in the models did not explain additional variation.

J	Bhatia, H; Dar, RA; Srivastava, G				Bhatia, Harshita; Dar, Reyaz Ahmad; Srivastava, Gaurav			Himalayan uplift and the evolution of a Mediterranean-type climate in the Kashmir Basin of India: Palaeobotanical evidence from the late Pliocene Dubjan Member (Karewa Group)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Kashmir Valley is an intermontane basin in the northwestern Himalayan region, characterized by a Mediterranean-type climate, where the primary source of moisture is winter precipitation brought by the Western Disturbance low-pressure system. This basin was formed around similar to 4 Ma due to the uplift of the Pir Panjal Range (Lesser Himalaya), which obstructed the ancient Himalayan drainage system, leading to the formation of a vast lake. The sediments deposited in this lake are assigned to the Karewa Group. In this paper, we reconstruct palaeoclimate using the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) and the Coexistence Approach (CA), based on late Pliocene leaf assemblages recovered from the Dubjan Member of the Hirpur Formation (Karewa Group). CLAMP-based climate reconstruction indicates a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 18.1 +/- 2.3 degrees C and a cold month mean temperature (CMMT) of 11.1 +/- 3.5 degrees C, suggesting a warm subtropical climate with a 9-10 month growing season. Estimated growing season precipitation (GSP) was 159.2 +/- 64.3 cm, with a strong seasonal rainfall pattern (WET:DRY ratio of 6.9:1). Higher vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and specific humidity (11.7 g kg(-1)) during summer and autumn indicate ample atmospheric moisture. CA-based estimates yield a MAT of 17.4 +/- 0.6 degrees C, CMMT of 6.9 +/- 3.1 degrees C, and warm month mean temperature (WMMT) of 25.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Precipitation data suggest a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 123.4 +/- 8.8 cm, with monthly extremes ranging from 22.1 +/- 0.5 cm (wettest) to 1.1 +/- 0.2 cm (driest). The aforesaid quantitative climate reconstruction and fossil leaf physiognomy reveal a warm, summer monsoon-dominated regime preceding the modern Mediterranean-type climate. This climatic transition is linked to the uplift of the Pir Panjal Range (Lesser Himalaya), offering valuable insights into orographic influences on regional hydrology, climate evolution, and associated biodiversity patterns.

J	Grosbois, G; Del Giorgio, PA; Rautio, M				Grosbois, Guillaume; Del Giorgio, Paul A.; Rautio, Milla			Zooplankton allochthony is spatially heterogeneous in a boreal lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The proportion of consumer biomass from terrestrial origin (i.e. allochthony) has been shown to vary greatly among lakes and also seasonally, but has been assumed to be spatially homogeneous within a lake. Given that the distribution of different organic carbon (C) sources tends to be spatially patchy in most lakes, this assumption may not be warranted. 2. We tested this hypothesis using a spatially intensive sampling designed to capture the in-lake heterogeneity in terrestrial inputs, phytoplankton, benthic algae and a dominant aquatic macrophyte (Brasenia schreberi: Cabombaceae) in a medium-sized boreal lake, and used a dual-isotope Bayesian mixing approach (delta C-13, delta H-2) to establish the degree of allochthony of the dominant copepod Leptodiaptomus minutus (Diaptomididae) across these sites. Samples were collected in spring when tributaries had high flow rates and aquatic primary producers (phytoplankton, macrophytes) had rapid growth rates, and in mid-summer when tributary flows were at the lowest. 3. There was substantial spatial variability in the stable-isotope composition of the copepod and consequently in its levels of allochthony in both seasons. Allochthony in L. minutus varied from 34 to 50% in spring and from 45 to 65% in summer, and this range was linked to the spatial variability in the main sources of organic C (terrestrial inputs via tributaries, B. schreberi and phytoplankton). Allochthony in L. minutus was lowest in areas dominated by macrophytes, and further influenced by the distribution of tributary-derived terrestrial C across the lake. Macrophyte and phytoplankton carbon contributed, respectively, up to 28 and 38% during growing season (spring) to the diet of the L. minutus, while benthic algae contribution was negligible. 4. Our results clearly show that the reliance of zooplankton on terrestrial C may be spatially heterogeneous even in a relatively small lake and, in particular, that macrophytes, whose distribution is typically patchier than that of phytoplankton, may play a major role in shaping the spatial patterns of zooplankton allochthony in lakes.					; Grosbois, Guillaume/M-8097-2019; del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	Grosbois, Guillaume/0000-0002-1306-8528; del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2017	62	3					474	490		10.1111/fwb.12879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12879													WOS:000397254500003
J	THORHALLSDOTTIR, TE				THORHALLSDOTTIR, TE			EFFECTS OF WINTER INUNDATION ON TUNDRA VEGETATION IN ICELAND - IMPLICATIONS FOR HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE ARCTIC	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The diversion of part of the Thjorsa river created a series of lakes and waterways in the central highland of Iceland. Every winter, ice jams have formed, raising lake levels and inundating upshore vegetation. At five sites by two lakes, the vegetation has remained flooded for about 160 d from mid-winter until spring. To monitor the effects of inundation, species frequency in 10- x 10- cm quadrats was recorded on permanent transects prior to disturbance and again after periods of up to 8 yr. At one site, measurements were made annually for the first 6 yr and again 8 yr after disturbance. Two types of response to winter inundation were distinguished: (1) species showing a steady decrease in frequency and (2) species apparently little affected for a number of years, then suddenly collapsing. Combining the five sites, the common species were classified according to the strength and nature of their response into four groups: (1) nine sensitive species that rapidly declined or disappeared with repeated submergence, (2) six species showing variable negative response, (3) five species showing little response, and 4) one species showing a positive response. The results show that arctic species which are characteristic of dry or moist habitats are intolerant of inundation, even when it occurs outside of the growing season. This conclusion has implications for hydroelectric development in other arctic areas.																			0004-0851					AUG	1993	25	3					220	227		10.2307/1551818	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551818													WOS:A1993LU32400010

We recorded four populations of the invasive alien species Orconectes limosus in four lakes and twenty-one of the native Austropotamobius pallipes complex from four lakes, four ponds and thirteen creeks; three of these populations went extinct during the three years of our survey. Crayfish populations were monitored in spring, summer and early autumn, to assess the distribution, density and seasonal dynamics of the two species. Statistical analysis of morphometric data showed differences in body size and growth rates among sampling sites, possibly related to local environmental factors, with higher growth rates in males of both species; A. pallipes grew faster in creeks than in lakes. The extinction of twenty-two native populations of A. pallipes complex in the last century was likely due to habitat modifications, in particular to the loss of riparian habitat, in few cases to overfishing, and, more recently, to the spread of alien species and the related transmission of their parasite Aphanomyces astaci. Some populations of A. pallipes complex were infested with the parasite Thelohania sp., and only one population with ectosymbiotic Branchiobdellida. In Trentino, small creeks with well developed riparian vegetation and good hydromorphological conditions, flowing through mountain slopes, can represent potential refuge and recruitment areas for of A. pallipes complex, without significant management intervention, although a sustainable management of piedmont water bodies would allow preserving or increasing the number and density of the relict populations.

Seasonal Movement Patterns of Inconnu in an Arctic Estuary Delta Complex	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Inconnu Stenodus leucichthys are a large, long-lived, piscivorous whitefish harvested in subsistence and sport fisheries in Alaska. In the Kotzebue region of northwestern Alaska, Inconnu are one of the most important food fishes, with 20,000C fish being harvested each year. This study was conducted to describe the summer and winter distribution of Inconnu from the Hotham Inlet-Selawik Lake delta complex, Alaska, between 2010 and 2012. Data collection methods consisted of surgically implanting acoustic telemetry tags in 80 fish from both the Selawik and Kobuk rivers in 2010 and 2011 (n = 320 total) and deploying a fixed array of 20 acoustic receiving stations throughout Selawik Lake and Hotham Inlet. Tagged Inconnu detections revealed that individuals from the Selawik and Kobuk rivers displayed a high degree of spatial and temporal overlap while colocated in the Hotham Inlet-Selawik Lake complex during both sampling years. During the winter period, tagged fish from both rivers predominately occupied the northern end of Hotham Inlet. In the summer period, fish moved between the northern end of Hotham Inlet to Selawik Lake and the southern end of Hotham Inlet. Average daily displacements for Selawik and Kobuk River Inconnu ranged from 2,000-10,000 m/d. As well as providing a more complete account of Inconnu life history, these results provide useful data that can be used for developing future management strategies, such as the appropriateness of stock-specific harvest guidelines and spatial and temporal regulations.

Geographic and seasonal variation of dissolved methane and aerobic methane oxidation in Alaskan lakes	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Methanotrophic bacteria play an important role oxidizing a significant fraction of methane (CH4) produced in lakes. Aerobic CH4 oxidation depends mainly on lake CH4 and oxygen (O-2) concentrations, in such a manner that higher MO rates are usually found at the oxic/anoxic interface, where both molecules are present. MO also depends on temperature, and via methanogenesis, on organic carbon input to lakes, including from thawing permafrost in thermokarst (thaw)-affected lakes. Given the large variability in these environmental factors, CH4 oxidation is expected to be subject to large seasonal and geographic variations, which have been scarcely reported in the literature. In the present study, we measured CH4 oxidation rates in 30 Alaskan lakes along a north-south latitudinal transect during winter and summer with a new field laser spectroscopy method. Additionally, we measured dissolved CH4 and O-2 concentrations. We found that in the winter, aerobic CH4 oxidation was mainly controlled by the dissolved O-2 concentration, while in the summer it was controlled primarily by the CH4 concentration, which was scarce compared to dissolved O-2. The permafrost environment of the lakes was identified as another key factor. Thermokarst (thaw) lakes formed in yedoma-type permafrost had significantly higher CH4 oxidation rates compared to other thermokarst and non-thermokarst lakes formed in non-yedoma permafrost environments. As thermokarst lakes formed in yedoma-type permafrost have been identified to receive large quantities of terrestrial organic carbon from thaw and subsidence of the surrounding landscape into the lake, confirming the strong coupling between terrestrial and aquatic habitats and its influence on CH4 cycling.

Recreational trolling effort and catch of Atlantic salmon and brown trout in Vanern, the EU's largest lake	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Recreational fishing has grown substantially worldwide; for some recreational fisheries both catch and economic value now exceeds that of commercial fisheries. Monitoring of recreational fisheries effort and catch is therefore important for sustainable fisheries management. We developed and implemented an angler survey to estimate effort and catch for the recreational trolling fishery for landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta) in Lake Vanern, Sweden. Major challenges were the large spatial scale and dispersed fishing effort, a lack of revenue from fishing licence sales, and a lack of catch reporting requirements. We developed a complemented roving/mail-in survey to estimate effort and catch during the main fishing periods, spring and fall, 2014. Instantaneous counts from major access sites were used for effort estimates, and mail-in surveys were used for catch rates. Our results show that Vanern supports a salmon and trout fishery of some 28.7 +/- 3.3 tonnes per year. Fishing effort was higher in the spring than in the fall, and there were seasonal differences in catch rates for trout but not for salmon. Estimates show that the recreational trolling fishery now harvests more salmon and trout annually than do the commercial and subsistence fisheries combined. This highlights the importance of continuing an angler survey program for Vanern as a key element for sustainable fisheries management, and can serve as a model for other recreational fisheries at large spatial scales.					; Bergman, Eva/R-8464-2016; Su, Zhenming/G-2857-2011	Piccolo, John/0000-0002-2633-4178; Su, Zhenming/0000-0002-0587-1847; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				JUL	2020	227								105548	10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105548	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105548													WOS:000525305400010

Patterns of Spring/Summer Open-Water Metabolism Across Boreal Lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												Northern regions host the greatest density of surface water globally, but knowledge of lake metabolism in this vast yet remote landscape is limited. Here, we used an oxygen stable isotope approach to quantify patterns and drivers of surface layer metabolism in lakes throughout an approximately 10(6) km(2) tract of boreal Canada. Ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) and respiration rates (R) were much higher than previously assumed for spring and summer months. Both rates were strongly linked to nitrogen (N) concentrations, not light availability, despite earlier work showing community-level light effects. Net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP - R) was negative for most lakes. Hierarchical modeling revealed that although NEP is strongly stabilized via similar effects of N on both GPP and R, NEP decreases with increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC). These interactive controls on NEP were not predictable from bivariate regressions linking NEP to physical, chemical or habitat-specific drivers. In contrast to expectations, NEP was higher in warmer waters due to increased temperature dependency of GPP, not R. Temperature and DOC content had opposing effects on NEP in all but the most dystrophic lakes, possibly implying a muted response of metabolic balances to future shifts in both regional climate and OC delivery.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019	Vachon, Dominic/0000-0003-1157-5240													1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2020	23	8					1581	1597		10.1007/s10021-020-00487-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-020-00487-7		FEB 2020											WOS:000515884600001

These variations have influenced the vegetation changes. The assumption that the relationship vegetation-climate sensu stricto was constant through time should be reconsidered taking into account the impact of the atmospheric CO2 content on the plants. Here we propose to use a process-based vegetation model (BIOMES) in an inverse mode to reconstruct from pollen data the most probable climate under precipitation seasonality change and under lowered CO2 concentration in the biosphere. Appropriate tools to match the model outputs with the pollen data are developed to generate a probability distribution associated with the reconstruction (Monte Carlo sampling and neural network techniques). The method is validated with modern pollen samples from Greece and Italy: it proves to be able to reconstruct modern climate with a more or less large error bar from pollen data. The error bar depends in fact on the tolerance of the vegetation to the corresponding climatic variable. The application to six pollen assemblages from Greece and Italy, representing the last glacial maximum (LGM: 18 000 C-14-year B.P.), is done into three experiments: (1) modern CO2 concentration; (2) LGm CO2 concentration; (3) LGM CO2 concentration and high winter precipitation. The latter experiment is motivated by evidence of high lake-levels in Greece during the LGM which has been attributed to winter rainfall. These experiments show that winter was ca. 15-20 degrees C colder than the present, in agreement with previous climate reconstruction. The apparent discrepancy between the high lake-levels and the steppe vegetation during the LGM, can be explained by an increase of the winter precipitation (which leads to high lake level) while the summer season is mild and dry (which affects the vegetation). The summer temperature has three stable states (-16 degrees C, - 10 degrees C, - 2 degrees C), but the warmest one is the most probable if we take into account the lowered CO2 and the high lake-levels.

Devon,Bathurst, and Melville islands. Waterfowl nested normally in 1975 but were prevented from doing so in 1974 by a late thaw. In 1974 Barrow Strait was ice free by 1 June. Densities of most species were lowest in spring 1975 than in 1974, when inhospitable conditions inland forced the birds to concentrate in coastal areas. In late summer brant (Branta bernicla) and oldsquaw (Clangula hyemalis) numbers were > in 1975 than in 1974; Brant left the central high Arctic in midsummer 1974, but the reason for the smaller numbers of Oldsquaw is not evident. Both snow geese (Chen caerulescens) and eiders (Somateria spp.) were more abundant in late summer 1974 than in 1975. Many snow geese moved to southeastern Somerset Island and adjacent waters to molt in 1974. In 1975 many eiders and snow geese remained at inland locations with their broods. Queens Channel, northern Somerset Island and Bellot Strait were important to waterfowl irrespective of spring phenology. Melville and Byam Martin islands were used by brant, and Canada geese (B. canadensis) occurred mainly on the Boothia Peninsula. Snow geese were abundant in both years in southeastern Somerset Island, particularly near Creswell Bay, where both breeding and molting occurred. Coastal waters of Barrow Strait, Prince Regent Inlet and the Gulf of Boothia were heavily used by oldsquaw in spring and summer, and Crooked Lake, Prince of Wales Island, was used by many molting oldsquaw in both years. Common eiders (S. mollisima) occurred principally in Queens Channel, Barrow Strait and near Bellot Strait; king eiders (S. spectabilis) concentrated in the same areas but were more widely distributed throughout the study area.																			0004-0843	1923-1245					1985	38	1					43	52																WOS:A1985AKP1600006

Unfortunately, 55-70 % are failing or out of compliance with state standards, Homeowners and small businesses require cost-effective options in locations with restrictive soil and site conditions. In particular, many sites occur near lakes and streams creating a health hazard and deteriorating water quality. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are one option being evaluated and this paper addresses CWs as a viable wastewater treatment option in Minnesota based on experiences at three research sites, encompassing 5 subsurface flow wetlands from 1995-2000. These are small flow (less than or equal to1000 gpd) subsurface flow gravel beds located at the Northeast Regional Correction Center (NERCC), Grand Lake, and Lake Washington, MN. Performance monitoring shows that CW's are a viable, year-round onsite treatment option. The systems were generally able to achieve design criteria of 30 mgBOD5/L, 25 mgTSS/L and 200 fecal cfu/100mL, although the NERCC CWs required 30 cm. of unsaturated soil to achieve consistent disinfection. High strength (similar to300mgBOD/L and 100mgTN/L) influent at NERCC probably limited system performance, particularly N-removal which was similar to40% in summer and similar to20% in winter (mass-based). Declining P-removal at the oldest sites suggest substrate saturation. Although CWs remain a viable option for homeowners in terms of performance, case of operation, and cost, other issues relate to inconsistent vegetation growth (affecting performance and freezing), and meeting concentration-based regulatory standards since they may exhibit substantial variability due to rain events, partial freezing, spring snowmelt, and summer evapotranspiration.																					1-892769-18-2				2001							650	662																WOS:000175044100069
J	Golenko, M; Zhurbas, V; Zavialov, P				Golenko, Maria; Zhurbas, Victor; Zavialov, Peter			Generation of cyclonic gyre in large saline lake through differential warming	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Circulation model of Lake Issyk-Kul is compiled based on Princeton Ocean Model with real bathymetry and atmospheric and river runoff forcings. According to the model, the cyclonic circulation develops in the lake from May to January, when a seasonal thermocline is present, while in February through April it vanishes or changes for a weak anticyclonic circulation. Wind-driven coastal jets and internal Kelvin waves intensify vertical mixing at a lateral periphery of the lake over sloping bottom. Due to enhanced vertical mixing and reduced depth, the water column warms up and cools down faster at the lateral periphery of the lake than in the deep central part. This, in view of geostrophic balance, causes cyclonic circulation in the period from late spring to early winter and the anticyclonic circulation during the rest of the year. River runoff does not play a primary role and only moderately contributes to the cyclonic circulation through the geostrophic adjustment of buoyant coastal discharges to the lake whose salinity is about 6 ppt. At the end of winter and beginning of spring, when river runoff is minimal, it is nevertheless capable of maintaining weak hydrostatically stable stratification in the coastal zone and thereby significantly weakening the development of cascading and deep-water ventilation. Model simulations showed that the cyclonic circulation prevailing in Lake Issyk-Kul would develop even without positive wind stress curl attributed to local winds.

Initial uptake of carrier-free labeled H3PO4 followed 1st order kinetics in accordance with a single 2-compartment model. In isotope equilibrium from 1.2-9.7% of radioactivity was found in the filtrate. Turnover times of orthophoshate in water were some minutes in summer and 2 orders of magnitude longer in winter and April. Turnover time of P in microorganisms was estimated on the basis of equilibrium isotope distribution between water and particular phases and turnover time in water. It ranged from 28 to over 1000 min. The shortest times were found in summer, and the longest in winter. Turnover time of orthophosphate in water increased in relation to PO43- additions according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The values of Michaelis-constant plus the ambient orthophosphate concentration (K + Sn) suggested an overestimation of real PO43- concentrations by chemical measurements, which are much lower than soluble reactive P in most cases, as in many other lakes. Both K + Sn values and maximum uptake velocities (V) were significantly higher in the hypertrophic basin than in the mesotrophic one, in contrast to essentially similar values of turnover times. Maximum uptake velocity per unit chlorophyll a and Popt [optimum P concentration]:V ratio showed extreme to moderate P deficiency for Lake Balaton plankton, which seemed to decrease somewhat in the course of eutrophication.

The acid-neutralizing capacity and pH of the streams were not significantly different between 1980 and 2000, although in a different grouping of 37 Adirondack streams, calcium levels were significantly lower in spring 2000 than in spring 1982. More fish and fish species were collected in 1999 than 1979. However, because changes occurred in streams with relatively high pH (> 6.0) as well as in low-pH streams, increases in fish caught may have been partly the result of improved electrofishing efficiency in 1999. In both 1999 and 1979, streams with spring pH less than 5.0 supported fewer fish, fewer salmonids, and fewer fish species than streams with higher pH. No young-of-year brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis were found in streams with a spring pH less than 4.98. Sensitive and acid-impacted streams continue to exist in the Adirondack region even though sulfate deposition has decreased since the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	2005	134	2					338	345		10.1577/T03-138.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T03-138.1													WOS:000228908900005

For yellow perch (Perca flavescens), 0.8% had died at 2.5-degrees-C, while 17.7% had died at 4.0-degrees-C. For both species, small fish died first. Multiple regression models relating overwinter mortality versus fall total length and winter duration predict 3.3 times greater mortality for white perch versus similar sized yellow perch at winter temperature regimes typical of the Great Lakes region. In laboratory tanks, white perch remained active throughout the winter period, while yellow perch sought cover and rested on or near the bottom of the experimental tanks. As a direct consequence, yellow perch had a lower routine metabolic rate and consumed body energy more gradually than white perch. During their inactive wintering period at 4.0-degrees-C, yellow perch consumed 25.8% less oxygen than white perch. Actual measurements of dry weight loss indicated that yellow perch in the experimental tanks at 2.5-degrees-C consumed 24.6% less dry weight than similar sized white perch. These differences in overwinter behaviour, metabolism, and survival appear to be adequate to account for observed differences in survival of these species in the wild.																			0706-652X					APR	1991	48	4					672	680		10.1139/f91-084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-084													WOS:A1991FF52000018

Epilimnetic samples were collected periodically throughout 1983 from 5 locations within Lake Arlington, Texas, USA. Total bacteria were determined from epifluoresence microscopy and averaged 1.1 .times. 1013 cells m-3 of water. Planktobacteria accounted for 85% of total cell counts and 73% of total bacterial biomass. Cell volumes were substantially larger in winter than in summer and were negatively correlated with temperature. Cell volumes ranged from 0.076 to 0.330 .mu.m3 and averaged 0.160 .mu.m3. The average biovolume corresponded to a sphere 0.670 .mu.m in diameter. Bacterial biomass was high, averaging 172 mg C m-3 water and reached seasonal maximum during winter months. Correlation analysis (simple linear and multiple linear) revealed that approximately 50% of the variation in bacterial biomass could be accounted for by variation in temperature and dissolved organic carbon.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	127	2					117	123		10.1007/BF00004191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004191													WOS:A1985AQZ4600003

Detection of earlier snowmelt in the Wind River Range, Wyoming, using Landsat imagery, 1972-2013	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												In the western United States snow has been melting earlier in recent decades due to warmer winter and spring weather. This is particularly noticeable in the Pacific Northwest and coastal areas, yet has been less obvious in locations farther inland. Using the historical Landsat image archive, snow cover was mapped in the Wind River Range (WRR) in northwestern Wyoming, from 1972-2013. The objective of this work was to estimate the temporal change in the rate of snowmelt in the Fremont Lake basin of the WRR for the 42-year study period. Much of the streamflow in Wyoming originates from melting snow in the WRR. Streamflow is a significant contributor to the water resources for the north-central part of the state and has tremendous societal and economic impacts especially during the prolonged drought that is affecting the western U.S. Consistent with the ongoing and severe drought, data from the Pine Creek Above Fremont Lake gauge show a striking reduction in cumulative stream discharge in the 2000s vs. the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Snow-cover depletion curves derived from snow maps created from Landsat imagery were generated for the period 1972-2013. MODerate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived standard snow-cover maps were also used to generate snow-cover depletion curves, from 2000-2013, to provide an accuracy assessment of the Landsat technique. Landsat-derived mean snow-cover depletion curves from 2000-2013 and from the three previous decades, show that snow cover in the Fremont lake basin is melting 16 +/- 10 days earlier, on average, in the 2000s compared to the period from 1972-1999. Increasing spring and summer nighttime air temperature is the likely driver of the earlier snowmelt documented in the Landsat record.

It is lobate-shaped and exhibits the typical surface morphology of transverse ridges and furrows on its western, most active part. The rock glacier is predominantly composed of dolomite debris derived from the Upper Triassic Hauptdolomit/Dolomia Principale. Compared to rock glaciers of regions with metamorphic bedrock the debris of the rock glaciers is finer grained and the surface morphology is less well developed. During the melt season thermokarst lakes appear on the surface. Meltwater is partly released as surface runoff at several springs, partly along fractures within the bedrock. Water temperature of these springs is permanently below 1 degrees C during the melt season indicating that within the rock glacier the water flows in contact with ice. Temperatures at the base of the winter snow cover (BTS) are significantly lower than on permafrost-free ground outside the rock glaciers. Annual flow velocities in the western part are low compared to other rock glaciers, ranging mostly between 5 and 30 cm. On the eastern part annual flow velocities near the front are almost zero. Ice exposures on the middle and upper part and internal structures (shear planes visible in radargrams) clearly indicate that this rock glacier contains a frozen core of coarse-grained, banded ice. We use the glacier model to explain the formation of rock glacier Murfreit and suggest that the rock glacier has developed from a debris covered glacier during retreat. As the steep front terminates at the edge of the terrace and the rock glacier is still active in the western part, debris flows may be initiated at the front during heavy rainfall events. Such debris flows occurred in summer 2003 and blocked the road to Groden Pass.

There are 21 types of wetlands in region, covering an area of 265.1 ha, with 42.8% on tufa. Wetland areas declined by 16.1% from 1983 to 1999 (autumn) and by 31.2% from 1983 to 2002 (summer) and increased by 31.8% from 1999 to 2011 (autumn) and by 60% from 2002 to 2014 (summer). Wetland changes included dissolving tufa, a reduced tufa deposit rate, collapse of tufa mats, increases in water nutrients and algae, and marshland development. Mean annual air temperature increased from 1977. Annual precipitation varied from 430 to 810mm between 1951 and 2015, exhibiting an increasing trend from 2005 onwards. The number of both heavy rain and storm events increased from 2005. The number of tourists grew slowly from 1984 to 1997, but increased quickly from 360000 in 1998 to 5.1 million in 2015. Commercial logging between 1966 and 1978 and debris flows are probably the key factors contributing to increased lake sedimentation and marshland development. Rapid tourism development with intensive bus movement and regional air pollution likely caused changes in water chemistry, which, in turn, caused tufa changes and wetland degradation. Reducing tourist numbers is likely to be effective in reducing effects on wetlands and conserving them, but research is needed to determine appropriate tourist numbers.					; Qiao, Xue/AAH-3453-2019	Qiao, Xue/0000-0001-7412-5090; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2018	69	5			SI		677	689		10.1071/MF17118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF17118													WOS:000430319400006

Phenological asynchrony in freshwater lakes can be studied retrospectively by analysing historical data, and prospectively by scenario analysis based on historical data. Models allowing to study phenology by scenario analysis need to be valid for multiple populations over decades limiting the suitability of process-based models that are structural rigid and calibratable only for a limited period of time. Here we applied models inferred from historical data by evolutionary computation to simulate food-web dynamics of the plankton community of Lake Muggelsee from 2002 to 2012. The models were driven by nutrient concentrations, water temperature (WT) and endogenous interrelationships within the plankton community. The validated models simulated seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of seven phyto-and zooplankton groups in response to scenarios of prospective global warming, nutrient enrichments as well as combinations of warming with nutrient enrichments and warming with nutrient reductions. Phenological WT-sensitivities resulting from the warming scenario indicated substantial shifts towards earlier timing of cyanobacteria peaks and delayed timing of cladocerans peaks in summer, suggesting significant phenological asynchrony in the plankton community of Lake Muggelsee. The phenological sensitivities of cyanobacteria and cladocerans towards phosphorus and nitrogen enrichments revealed similar trends of summer peaks as identified for warming, most likely contributing to phenological asynchrony. The combination of warming and nutrient reductions showed increased spring maxima but almost unchanged summer peaks of cyanobacteria demonstrating that gradually decreasing phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations may outweigh warming effects on phytoplankton growth. Scenarios that simulated WT-and nutrient-changes as gradual processes rather than immediately imposed events proved to be more realistic and credible. The proposed ensemble of complementary inferential models proved to be a viable tool for determining long-term dynamics and phenological asynchronies in plankton communities under the impact global changes.					; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014	Recknagel, Friedrich/0000-0002-1028-9413; 													1364-8152	1873-6726				DEC	2021	146								105224	10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105224		OCT 2021											WOS:000708664400002

There was wide range of prey and considerable local variation, indicating an opportunist predator. Terrestrial animals were taken more freequently along watercourses. Crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes were the major food in two areas, especially in summer, and birds on one lake where there were large wildfowl populations and few crayfish. Consumption of fish was highest in winter with perch Perca fluviatilis and eel Anguilla anguilla the most frequent species, the latter peaking in summer. Mink probably do not select fish from a particular size range. Lagomorphs and rats Rattus norvegicus were the main mammalian prey. Frogs Rana temporaria were locally and seasonally important. Other invertebrates, vegetable and inanimate matter were probably consumed accidentally, but Dytiscus beetles seem to be a genuine minor food.																			0035-8983						1986	86	7					169	182																WOS:A1986J034500001

Brown trout were stocked in spring (late May to early June) in 1974-1991 and in summer (late June to early July) in 1992-2001. The biomass of the vendace, Coregonus albula (L.), population (prey) at release time had the largest positive effect on stocking success within both periods: biomass of adult vendace in spring and both 0+ and adult vendace in summer. Increasing the size of stocked fish had a positive effect if the vendace available at release were only adults. The increasing trend of predator-catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) [combined CPUE of northern pike Esox lucius L., burbot Lota lota (L.), and pike-perch Stizostedion lucioperca (L.)] through the study period and its negative effect on trout stocking success suggested an increasing effect of predation within the entire time series.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2005	14	4					303	310		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00104.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2005.00104.x													WOS:000233141700001

We applied a multiproxy approach based on the analysis of mineral magnetism, diatom assemblages and major elements geochemistry. The reconstructed paleoenvironmental history identify the end of the globally cool MIS 6 as wetter than present, with high lake level, and a subsequent change to drier climates at the onset of the last interglacial (ca. 130 ka). Large amplitude changes in most of the analyzed parameters from ca. 130 to 74 ka are approximately coincident with MIS 5 (130-71 ka). The amplitude of these changes decreases in MIS 4 (71-57 ka) and the early part of MIS 3 (57-35 ka). We proposed that the inferred climatic oscillations follow insolation variations during MIS 6 and part of MIS 5 (150-88 ka). Low summer and spring insolation and lower seasonality inhibited evaporation and favored high lake levels. Conversely, maxima in spring and summer insolation promoted dry conditions and low lake levels. The major wet-cold glacial and dry-warm interglacial relationship found in Lake Titicaca (Bolivia) and Lake Chalco records shows the sensitivity of high altitude tropical sites to climatic variability.

Due to their specific location (slope), the investigated water bodies form a cascade system. They are situated 25 km from the city of Olsztyn, in the Dywity municipality (Olsztyn Lakeland), in an agricultural catchment. Due to their low average depth (1 to 2 m), the analyzed water bodies can be classified as polymictic. The aim of this study was to analyze the temperature and oxygen profiles of water bodies restored approximately 30 years ago. The profiles were determined during winter stagnation (2005 and 2006) and summer stagnation (2007). An analysis of temperature and oxygen conditions performed in the summer confirmed close correlations between the studied parameters. All lakes were characterized by incomplete thermal and oxygen stratification, typical of shallow water bodies. The oxygen profiles determined in the winter showed a temperature distribution pattern characteristic of reverse thermal stratification. In all investigated water bodies, surface water temperature was close to 0 degrees C, and it increased gradually from a depth of 30-50 cm. During winter stagnation, the highest dissolved oxygen content was noted in the top layer of water under the ice, and oxygen concentrations varied widely between years. The lowest oxygen content was observed at the bottom, and critically low values (from 0.16 mgO(2) . dm(-3) to 0.29 mgO(2) . dm(-3)), were recorded during the severe winter of 2006, when ice cover thickness reached 40 cm and organic matter decomposition and aerobic respiration processes led to almost complete oxygen depletion.

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of CDOM dynamics in the Persian Gulf's industrialized coastal waters, focusing on the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ)-a global energy epicenter and the world's largest natural gas reserve. Seasonal field campaigns conducted in 2023 acquired 199 in situ samples stratified across four seasons (Spring: n = 62, Summer: n = 18, Fall: n = 55, Winter: n = 64) using a CTD-integrated Cyclops-7 fluorometer. Sampling intervals were methodologically synchronized with satellite overpasses (+/- 3 h) to minimize temporal discrepancies between ground-truth measurements and remotely sensed data, thereby ensuring spatiotemporal coherence essential for robust algorithm calibration and validation. Contrary to expectations, CDOM concentrations in petrochemical-influenced areas (e.g., stations P7: 0.29 ppb, P13: 0.35 ppb) were markedly lower than in natural mangrove ecosystems (stations N13: 19.61 ppb, NA2: 12.91 ppb), underscoring the antagonistic effects of industrial pollutants on organic matter stability. Initial CDOM retrieval algorithms yielded suboptimal accuracy (MAE = 1.16, RMSLE = 1.2). A regionally tuned band ratio algorithm improved performance by 27 % (MAE = 0.85) and 22 % (RMSLE = 0.94). Machine learning models further enhanced retrievals, with the Mixture Density Network (MDN) emerging as the superior framework. The MDN achieved an RMSLE of 0.47 (17.5 % improvement over MLP, 14.5 % over SVM) and reduced systematic bias (SSPB) by 26.12 units compared to Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR), outperforming conventional models like SVM (MAE = 0.61, RMSLE = 0.55). While the MDN exhibited marginally higher absolute error (MAE = 0.53) than deterministic models, its probabilistic architecture uniquely addressed the Persian Gulf's optical complexity, characterized by overlapping signals from SGD-driven organics, hydrocarbon plumes, and sediment resuspension. This study establishes MDN as a transformative tool for CDOM retrieval in optically heterogeneous, anthropogenically stressed waters, while advocating for regionally adaptive frameworks to advance precision water quality monitoring in critical marine ecosystems.

In the reserve dam lake of Sidi Salem (northern Tunisia), a total of 7200 specimens was collected in monthly sampling over two years, from August 1996 to July 1998. Each sample of shrimps was sorted in the laboratory and separated into juveniles, males, and females. The presence of ovigerous females during spring and summer indicated that reproduction of Atyaephyra desmarestii is seasonal, starting in March and ending in August, followed by a sexual rest of six months, from September to February. The peak of reproductive females occurred in April and undifferentiated juveniles were present over the year. Fecundity was positively correlated with the size of ovigerous females. The sex-ratio underwent seasonal and monthly fluctuations, related to the size of the shrimp. Females were less numerous than males between 15 and 20 mm, but dominated beyond 20 mm. Analysis of the size-frequency distribution allowed to identify ten cohorts, four in the first sample of August 1996, and the other six during the rest of the sampling period. Life span was estimated between 13 and 16 months, based on 2 cohorts per season, one in spring and the other in summer. Cohorts appearing in May of each year, quickly reached sexual maturity and became reproductive after three months at just 17-18 mm total length.

This study develops an empirical multivariate linear regression (MLR) model to directly estimate Chla in Quan Son Reservoir using Sentinel-2B (S2B) Level 2A images. Regression analysis of a 68-point in-situ Chla dataset measured in Quan Son Reservoir between 2021 and 2023, in conjunction with the corresponding S2B reflectance data, reveals a significant correlation between Chla and a combination of the blue (B2), green (B3), and red (B4) bands (coefficient of determination, R (2) = 0.95). The Chla estimation model is validated using a 30-point in-situ dataset collected on various dates (R (2) = 0.87; the root-mean-squared error RMSE < 5%). Subsequently, the model is applied to ten S2B images acquired from 2021 to 2023, revealing Chla's spatio-temporal distribution across the reservoir. Two key trends emerge: (1) Chla is lower during winter (November and December) than in summer and early autumn (July and September), and (2) The distribution of Chla undergoes noticeable spatial changes, particularly in July, with elevated levels observed in areas characterized by tourist hotspots.

However, the large archive of stereo images available allows estimates of glacier-wide mass balance ((B) over dot) in decadal time steps since 1945. Combined with climate records, they provide further insight into glacier-climate relationship. This study presents a workflow to process aerial photographs (1945-1995), spy satellite imagery (1977-1980) and modern satellite stereo images (since 2000) using photogrammetric techniques and robust statistics in a highly automated, open-source pipeline to retrieve seasonally corrected, decadal glacier-wide geodetic mass balances. In our test area, Eyjafjallajokull (S-Iceland, similar to 70 km(2)), we obtain a mass balance of (B) over dot(1945)(2014) = -0.27 +/- 0.03 m w.e.a(-1), with a maximum and minimum of (B) over dot(1984)(1989) = 0.77 +/- 0.19 m w.e.a(-1) and (B) over dot(1994)(1998) = -1.94 +/- 0.34 m w.e.a(-1), respectively, attributed to climatic forcing, and (B) over dot(2009)(2010) = -3.39 +/- 0.43 m w.e.a(-1), mostly caused by the April 2010 eruption. The reference-surface mass balances correlate with summer temperature and winter precipitation, and linear regression accounts for 80% of the mass-balance variability, yielding a static sensitivity of mass balance to summer temperature and winter precipitation of - 2.1 +/- 0.4 m w.e.a(-1)K(-1) and 0.5 +/- 0.3 m w.e.a(-1) (10%)(-1), respectively. This study serves as a template that can be used to estimate the mass-balance changes and glaciers' response to climate.					; Adalgeirsdottir, Gudfinna/M-3073-2015; Pálsson, Finnur/B-7047-2016; Berthier, Etienne/B-8900-2009	Belart, Joaquin M.

Three sites were sampled when the hypolimnion was either oxygenated or anoxic: (i) the lake's deepest point, (ii) a littoral site receiving inflows from the catchment, and (iii) a littoral site influenced by nearby septic tanks. Phosphate (PO43--P), lanthanum (La), iron (Fe), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulfate (SO42-) were measured in porewater samples. An inverse diagenetic model was used to quantify fluxes of dissolved elements across the sediment-water interface as well as the net rate of their reactions along the porewater concentration gradients. Results show that porewater P and Fe underwent strong seasonal dynamics, while La did not. P fluxes, 20-fold higher at the deepest site than elsewhere in the basin, were influenced by anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion during summer and winter, suggesting that P mobility remained sensitive to redox fluctuations despite the addition of La. At the deepest site, fluxes of P across the sediment-water interface increased from 1 to 9 x 10-9 mu mol cm-2 s-1 between spring and summer, while the rate of P production to the porewater also increased a hundredfold. These increases were concurrent with Fe mobilization. Finally, sediment dating shows that the fraction of P sequestered by La is buried under freshly deposited sediment at a rate of 2-3 mm per year. These results indicate that external P fluxes and erosion control remain crucial to maintain the longevity of the LMB treatment. Seasonal porewater dynamics in a lanthanum-remediated lake reveal that phosphorus mobility remains sensitive to redox conditions during its burial.

For remote sensing-based methods for the measurement of Chla, in-situ hyperspectral data is crucial for building retrieval models. In the Pearl River Estuary, we used 61 groups of in-situ hyperspectral data and corresponding Chla concentrations collected in July and December 2020 to build a Chla retrieval model that takes the two different seasons and the turbidity of water into consideration. The following results were obtained. (1) Based on the pre-processing techniques for hyperspectral data, it was shown that the first-derivative of 680 nm is the optimal band for the estimation of Chla in the Pearl River Estuary, with R-2 > 0.8 and MAPE of 26.03%. (2) To overcome the spectral resolution problem in satellite image retrieval, based on the simulated reflectance from the Sentinel-2 satellite and the shape of the discrete spectral curve, we constructed a multispectral model using the slope difference index method, which reached a R-2 of 0.78 and MAPE of 35.21% and can integrate the summer and winter data. (3) The slope difference method applied to the Sentinel-2 image shows better performance than the red-NIR ratio method. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is practicable for Chla monitoring of coastal waters based on both in-situ data and images.					; Xie, Xuetong/CAA-4221-2022	Cao, Bowen/0000-0002-4469-6367; Xia, Xuening/0000-0002-1473-3876; Li, Haitao/0000-0001-7274-5798; YANG, X.K./0000-0003-1303-195X														2072-4292				MAY	2022	14	9							2270	10.3390/rs14092270	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14092270													WOS:000794552600001

Recent advances in subglacial hydrological modeling allow us to shed light on subglacial processes that lead to changes in ice mass balance in High Mountain Asia. We present the first application of the Subglacial Hydrology And Kinetic, Transient Interactions (SHAKTI) model on an alpine glacier. Shishper Glacier, our study site, is a mountain glacier in northern Pakistan that exhibits concurrent surges and GLOFs, which endanger local communities and infrastructure. Without coupling to ice velocity, the modeled subglacial hydrological system undergoes transitions between inefficient to efficient drainage and back during spring and fall, supporting previous observations of spring and fall speedups of glaciers in the region. We compare modeled effective pressures from the years 2017-19 with previously observed velocities, suggesting that while subglacial hydrology may explain seasonal sliding dynamics, our model is unable to provide an explanation for surge-scale behavior, implicating a need for coupled hydrological and ice dynamics modeling of surge conditions. This work demonstrates the potential of using ice sheet models for alpine glaciology and provides a new nucleus for modeling of glacial hazards in alpine environments.

Use of seasonal epilithic diatom assemblages to evaluate ecological status in Irish lakes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Periphyton is increasingly used to assess the biological condition of lakes. The predominance of relatively shallow exposed waterbodies in Ireland implies that epilithic diatoms should have a prominent role as bioindicators for the WFD; but epilithic diatom ecology in these Irish systems is poorly described. We characterised spring and summer diatom populations in diverse periphyton communities in 91 Irish lake waterbodies. Six assemblage clusters of diatom species were identified, and variation in their assemblages was predominately associated with environmental gradients of acidity-alkalinity, total phosphorus, and true colour. Diatom composition differed amongst high status lakes in three a priori defined lake alkalinity groups commonly used as a diatom typology for lake classification. However, when waterbodies were evaluated with a lake trophic diatom index (LTDI) their distribution of 'expected-values' was equivalent. The LTDI was highly correlated with total phosphorus but also had similar responses in the three lake alkalinity types. These findings indicated that lake typology had a limited role for diatom classification with the LTDI in Ireland. Matched spring and summer sampling across wide environmental gradients allowed the role of seasonality to be investigated. Relatively few benthic diatoms had a significant seasonal indicator value suggesting that unbiased monitoring of the epilithon is possible during any month of the growing season in comparable temperate waterbodies. However, temporal variability was lower at low values of the LTDI and increased unpredictably on a lake by lake basis thereafter. Given that lake diatom classification has been validated we suggest that the approach could be developed and used for more targeted assessment objectives.

Post-Spawning Survival and Downstream Passage of Landlocked Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) in a Regulated River: Is There Potential for Repeat Spawning?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Repeat salmonid spawners may make large contributions to total recruitment and long term population stability. Despite their potential importance, relatively little is known about this phase of the life history for anadromous populations, and nothing has been reported for landlocked populations. Here, we studied post-spawning behaviour and survival of landlocked Atlantic salmon in relation to downstream dam passage in the River Klaralven, Sweden. Eight hydropower stations separate the feeding grounds in Lake Vanern from the spawning grounds in the River Klaralven, and no measures to facilitate downstream migration are present in the river. Forty-nine percent of the salmon survived spawning and initiated downstream migration. Females and small fish had higher post-spawning survival than males and large fish. The post-spawners migrated downstream in autumn and spring and remained relatively inactive in the river during winter. Downstream migration speed in the free flowing part of the river was highly variable with a median of 9.30km/day. Most fish passed the first hydropower station via upward-opening spill gates after a median residence time in the forebay of 25min. However, no tagged fish survived passage of all eight hydropower stations to reach Lake Vanern. This result underscores the need for remedial measures to increase the survival of downstream migrating kelts. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Warren, JM; Cutting, KA				Warren, Jeffrey M.; Cutting, Kyle A.			Breeding strategy and organochlorine contamination of eggs in lesser scaup (Aythya affinis)	ECOTOXICOLOGY												We explored relationships between breeding strategy and contaminant importation and depuration into lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) eggs. Our primary hypothesis was that females accumulate organochlorine (OC) contaminants in lipid reserves obtained on wintering and spring staging areas and depurate those contaminants into eggs on the breeding area proportional to the amount of endogenous reserves used for egg formation. Egg collection occurred at Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, Montana, in 2006 for contaminant and stable isotope analysis. Eggs were assayed for 22 lipophilic OCs and endogenous lipid reserves for each egg were estimated using carbon (delta(13)C) stable isotope values. Of the 22 OC analytes tested for, only p,p'-DDE was detected in all samples, oxychlordane was detected in 56%, and no other OC analytes tested for were detected in > 50% of samples. The mean percent contribution of endogenous reserves to egg lipids in scaup was 37.9 +/- A 0.05%, ranging from 0-88.2%. We found little support for the hypothesized relationship between breeding strategy and egg contaminant levels. No significant trend was observed for endogenous reserves and egg contaminant levels of p,p'-DDE or oxychlordane (R (2) < 0.01, P = 0.792; R (2) < 0.01, P = 0.674, respectively). Thus, our results did not indicate that breeding females are importing contaminants from wintering or spring staging areas and depurating those contaminants into their clutches.																			0963-9292					JAN	2011	20	1					110	118		10.1007/s10646-010-0561-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-010-0561-5								21080226					WOS:000286003700012
J	Koziol, CP; Arnold, N				Koziol, Conrad P.; Arnold, Neil			Modelling seasonal meltwater forcing of the velocity of land-terminating margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE												Surface runoff at the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) drains to the ice-sheet bed, leading to enhanced summer ice flow. Ice velocities show a pattern of early summer acceleration followed by mid-summer deceleration due to evolution of the subglacial hydrology system in response to meltwater forcing. Modelling the integrated hydrological-ice dynamics system to reproduce measured velocities at the ice margin remains a key challenge for validating the present understanding of the system and constraining the impact of increasing surface runoff rates on dynamic ice mass loss from the GrIS. Here we show that a multi-component model incorporating supraglacial, subglacial, and ice dynamic components applied to a land-terminating catchment in western Greenland produces modelled velocities which are in reasonable agreement with those observed in GPS records for three melt seasons of varying melt intensities. This provides numerical support for the hypothesis that the subglacial system develops analogously to alpine glaciers and supports recent model formulations capturing the transition between distributed and channelized states. The model shows the growth of efficient conduit-based drainage up-glacier from the ice sheet margin, which develops more extensively, and further inland, as melt intensity increases. This suggests current trends of decadal-timescale slowdown of ice velocities in the ablation zone may continue in the near future. The model results also show a strong scaling between average summer velocities and melt season intensity, particularly in the upper ablation area. Assuming winter velocities are not impacted by channelization, our model suggests an upper bound of a 25% increase in annual surface velocities as surface melt increases to 4 x present levels.

J	HAPPEYWOOD, CM				HAPPEYWOOD, CM			DIURNAL AND SEASONAL-VARIATION IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AUTOTROPHIC PICOPLANKTON, NANOPLANKTON, AND MICROPLANKTON TO THE PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF AN UPLAND LAKE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												An investigation of the diurnal variation in productivity and contribution to production of populations of autotrophic picoplankton (0.2-2.0 mum), nanoplankton (>2 <20 mum) and microplankton (>20 mum) was carried out at monthly intervals, from May to October 1989, in Llyn Padarn a mesotrophic upland lake in North Wales. Maximum rates and contributions to production of the lake by autotrophic picoplankton occurred during mid-late summer, with the highest average daily contribution from picoplankton (64%) recorded in September at 4 m depth. Diurnal variation in contributions from picoplankton was pronounced, with greatest input, recorded at the end of the day, during the period of picoplankton dominance in mid-late summer. Maximum contribution from picoplantkon (86% of total, 9.2 mg C m-3 h-1) was recorded in September. Nanoplankton primary production was of greatest significance in June and July, although levels were lower than for picoplankton in subsequent months. Contributions via nanoplankton increased with depth in the lake at this time, reaching a maximum of 78% of the total at the end of the day at 9 m depth in early July. At this time, diurnal variation in contributions via nanoplankton was considerable, with maximum photosynthesis generally at the end of the photoperiod at depths of 4 and 9 m. Microplankton made the greatest impact on primary production during the mixed water conditions of spring and autumn, and at these times diel variation in production was less than those of both pico- and nanoplankton during summer thermal stratification. Photosynthetic capacity was lower for picoplankton than for nanoplankton and microplankton; the highest values were 5, 33 and 51 mg C (mg chl a)-1 h-1 for pico-, nano- and microplankton, respectively. The photosynthetic efficiency of all three size categories of phytoplankton increased with depth. Maximum values were similar for all phytoplankton groups, between 75 and 131 mg C (mg chl a)-1 E-1 m2, but mean levels of photosynthetic efficiency for the 6 months were lower for picoplankton than for nano- or microplankton. Rates of carbon fixation per cell for picoplankton spanned three orders of magnitude, varied considerably diurnally and reached maximum values of 484 fg C (cell)-1 h-1 in the afternoon in near-surface waters in the early stages of exponential population growth in July. During the population maximum of picoplankton in August and September, maximum daily values of carbon fixation per cell, assimilation number and photosynthetic efficiency were all recorded at the end of the day. The seasonal and diurnal patterns of production of the three size categories of planktonic algae in Llyn Padarn were distinct. During spring, microplankton (mainly diatoms) were the dominant primary producers. As thermal stratification developed, nanoplankton were the major contributors to phytoplanktonic production, particularly in the deeper regions of the euphotic zone. Picoplankton made the greatest contribution to production in August and September, exhibiting maximum input towards the end of the light cycle. Diatoms became the major photosynthetic plankton in the mixed water conditions prevalent in Llyn Padarn in October.																			0142-7873					FEB	1993	15	2					125	159		10.1093/plankt/15.2.125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/15.2.125													WOS:A1993KP15400002

BJ-1 multispectral image has the advantages to monitoring algal growing, such as wide swath as much as 600km and short revisit period about 3-5 days. But BJ-1 multispectral image does not have calibration coefficients, so the rigid atmosphere correction cannot be applied and the NDVI threshold value is unstable for extracting algal bloom in multi-temporal BJ-1 multispectral images. To solve this problem, Pseudo Invariant Feature(PIF) method was used to relatively radiometric correcting other multispectral images based on the image of May 21, 2006. The threshold value was -0.1 for NDVI by the aid of visual interpretation, which was applied to 14 BJ-1 multiple images from the year 2006 to the first half year 2007. The result showed that PIF method was a good approach and the extracted algal bloom area is close to that of visual interpretation. Through the monitoring during one and half years, the distribution of the algal bloom in Taihu Lake shows: 1) the algal bloom outbreak is mainly in summer, autumn and early winter, from May to November; 2) the algal bloom always distributes in the northern part such as Zhushan Bay, Meiliang Bay and the western coastwise lake.

However, detailed statistical information about spring floods is lacking. Remote sensing is an ideal tool for collecting data over large areas. The objective is to evaluate the relative usefulness and limitations of multiple satellite sensors for monitoring spring flooding across the entire Lena River. Spring floods progress at a speed of similar to 100 km day(-1) during the snowmelt period, expanding the width of the floodplain from several kilometers upstream to several tens of kilometers downstream. The 30-m-resolution Landsat and 500-m-resolution MODIS were sufficient to monitor the spatial extent of the flood. However, the upstream floodplain was too narrow to detect using 25-km-resolution AMSR-E. The AMSR-E was barely able to detect the presence or absence of floods at midstream. However, the AMSR-E microwave sensor could monitor day-to-day variation of spring floods. Images from optical sensors such as Landsat and MODIS were considerably limited by cloud cover. The 10-m-resolution PALSAR was unable to monitor spring floods during the 5-year operational period, because the temporal resolution of 46 days was insufficient to monitor floods. It was sometimes possible to obtain meaningful results from a single remote sensor, but it was impossible to fully understand spring flood behavior over the entire Lena River. An assemblage of sensors with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions would be helpful for flood risk management.

Studying the CH4 concentrations and emissions in these environments is important to estimate the total regional production of CH4 and to understand the main factors related to these emissions. The aim of this study was to measure the CH4 emissions from two shallow polymictic lakes in southern Brazil and to evaluate the roles of temperature and trophic level in increasing these emissions. Temperature was positively correlated with CH4 concentration in the water column, bubble emissions and diffusion. Both lakes exhibited significant seasonal differences in water-column and sediment methane concentrations and diffusion. The eutrophic lake produced more bubble emissions [6868.95 (+/- 7645.97) mu mol m(-2) d(-1) in winter and 11,251.10 (+/- 10,160.92) mu mol m(-2) d(-1) in summer]. Water-column and sediment concentrations [19.92 (+/- 11.74) mu mol L-1 and 1727.85 (+/- 1581.19) mu mol g(-1), respectively)] and diffusion [27,549.94 (+/- 18,258.15) mu mol m(-2) d(-1)] were also higher in summer than in winter in both lakes. All measured parameters were higher in the eutrophic lake, highlighting the maintenance of aquatic ecosystems in a low trophic state. Based on bubble emissions, the oligo-mesotrophic lake released an estimated 3142.8 g ha(-1) yr(-1) of CH4, while the eutrophic lake contributed 287,868.6 g ha(-1) yr(-1). Estimates of diffusive flux were higher: 41,832 g ha(-1) yr(-1) in summer for the oligo-mesotrophic lake and 1388.52 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the eutrophic lake. Our results show that shallow aquatic subtropical ecosystems are potential sources of atmospheric methane, and their contribution to global warming must be taken into account. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The reconstructions from the Folgefonna peninsula suggest that the early Holocene was relatively cool and dry until c. 8000 cal. yr BP, followed by a warm and humid mid-Holocene until c. 4000 cal. yr BP with inferred T-jul above 12 degrees C and P-w reaching as high as 225% of the present day. Subsequent to c. 4000 cal. yr BP a reduction is seen in both inferred T-jul and P-w with large fluctuations during the last 500 years. In addition, new calculations of P-w from two glaciers ( Hardangerjokulen and Jostedalsbreen) in southern Norway are presented. The results show that P-w varied in phase at all glaciers, probably as a response to the same climate forcing factor. During the early Holocene a major shift is suggested between winds from the west and the east.					; Birks, John/C-3103-2008; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020; Birks, H.

Isolation and Characterization of Novel Iron-Oxidizing Autotrophic and Mixotrophic Bacteria from Boiling Springs Lake, an Oligotrophic, Acidic Geothermal Habitat	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												Previous molecular surveys indicated Acidimicrobium sp. were abundant in samples from hot (52C), acidic (pH 2), oligotrophic Boiling Springs Lake (BSL) in Lassen Volcanic National Park. We isolated and characterized Acidimicrobium sp. and functionally related bacteria from BSL. The pH and temperature optima of all isolates correlate with the average summer conditions of BSL suggesting these organisms are capable of active growth in BSL. Acidimicrobium isolates were capable of oxidizing iron when grown mixotrophically or autotrophically. The isolates also oxidized iron after growth cessation, suggesting a possible role of iron oxidation in maintaining homeostasis in the absence of population growth.

CHANGES IN PROXIMATE AND FATTY-ACID COMPOSITIONS OF CARP FED LOW PROTEIN-HIGH ENERGY DIETS DUE TO STARVATION DURING WINTER	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												This experiment was conducted to examine the effect of a low protein-high energy diet or a high protein-high energy diet given to carp kept in net cages in Lake Kasumigaura [Japan] before winter on the proximate and fatty acid compositions of carp harvested in spring after starvation for 128 days. Condition factor and visceral and gonad somatic indices were not much affected by the quality of diets in terms of the protein and energy levels given to the fish before winter starvation. Decrease of muscle protein and visceral lipid due to starvation suggested that the fish used mainly visceral lipid and muscle protien as energy source and not so much lipid during winter starvation. In the fatty acid composition of muscle total lipids from carp on each diet, some fatty acids such aas 16 : 0, 20 : 1 and 22 : 1 increased, and 18 : 1 and 18 : 3.omega.3 decreased slightly due to starvation. However, there was no marked difference in the fatty acid distribution between males and females in each lot which showed almost the same pattern in changes of the fatty acid profile before and after winter.																			0021-5392	1349-998X				AUG	1987	53	8					1425	1429																WOS:A1987K698400018

TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												As a result of climate change, salt lakes on Eyre Peninsula are predicted to have shorter hydroperiods. Already there are salinity increases due to land use changes, so major decreases in biodiversity are expected. The likely situation is different however for the few lakes receiving waters via marine springs, with Seagull Lake, 20 km south of Streaky Bay, the best example. It has been thoroughly surveyed as a base to assess future changes. This lake originated about 6000 years ago as a marine bay, since occluded by coastal dunes. Its waters are a balance between meteoric sources, groundwater and marine water via springs with seasonal fluctuations due to input variations and evaporation. A conceptual model closely matched field observations. Presently the main lake varied in salinity seasonally from 75 to 200 g/L, with the spring virtually constant at 37-40 g/L. Plants in the lake and its palustrine margins numbered 25 species arranged into 18 floristic associations. Of particular interest are the marine alga Acetabularia peniculus in the floodout lakelet from the spring, the vulnerable shrub Tecticornia flabelliformis at limited suitable habitat locations on the lake floor margins and the alga Achanthes breviceps in the soaks on beach rock. Invertebrates number 37 species, of which 17 are marine, confined to the springs, including two cnidarians, two polychaetes, four crustaceans and eight molluscs. The lake itself supports a few widespread continental saline species, and other freshwater-derived invertebrates in the peripheral lakelets. A fish, Leptatherina presbyteroides, lives permanently in the main spring and spreads to the lake in winter. Thirty-nine species of birds have been seen on the lake including regular species like the Banded Stilt, Red-capped Plover and Red-necked Stint. Sea Gulls and Fairy Terns breed on the lake islands. We postulate that with decreased rainfall and sea level rise, the marine springs will deliver more water to the lake, making it permanent and of lower salinity. But ultimately with evaporation of these new waters, the lake will eventually become a salt flat. Plant distribution will be severely disrupted, with the palustrine herblands moving landwards, Sarcocornia quinqueflora likely to overwhelm the vulnerable Tecticornia flabelliformis, and Zostera ?mucronata of the spring expanding its domain initially but ultimately retreating back to the spring. Invertebrate and bird diversity will initially increase, but as the lake becomes a salt flat diversity will finally decrease towards zero.

Recent temperature trends in the South Central Andes reconstructed from sedimentary chrysophyte stomatocysts in Laguna Escondida (1742 m a.s.l., 38°28 S, Chile)	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												In this study we present a quantitative, high resolution reconstruction of past austral winter length in the Chilean Andes at 38 degrees S from AD 1920 to 2009. For Laguna Escondida, a nearly pristine lake situated on the flanks of the Andes at 1740 m above sea level, past variability in the duration of the winter season (Days T-4 (degrees c)) was reconstructed. Because high elevation meteorological stations are absent in this region, the reconstruction provides novel insights into recent temperature trends in the central-southern Andes. As a cold -season temperature proxy, we used chrysophyte stomatocysts. This novel proxy for cold season temperature was so far applied successfully in the European Alps and Pyrenees but has not yet been tested in the Southern Hemisphere. The reconstruction in this study was based on a newly developed Transfer Function to estimate Days T-4 degrees c (number of consecutive days with surface water temperatures at or below 4 degrees C) from sedimentary stomatocyst assemblages (R-boot(2) = 0.8, RMSEPboot = 28.7 days (= half the standard deviation)). To develop a high quality TF model, sediment traps and thermistors were placed in thirty remote lakes along an altitude gradient (420-2040 m Complete materials and data were collected in 24 lakes after one year. Detailed statistical analyses indicate that modern stomatocysts primarily respond to the length of the cold season. The TF model was then applied to the sedimentary stomatocysts from a Pb-210-dated short core of L. Escondida. Comparison to independent reanalysis data showed that reconstructed changes in Days T-4 degrees c provides detailed information on winter -spring temperature variability since AD 1920. The reconstruction shows that recent warming (onset in AD 1980) in the southern Chilean Andes was not exceptional in the context of the past century. This is in strong contrast to studies from the Northern Hemisphere. The finding is also in contrast to the cooling temperature trends which were detected using meteorological measurement data in low altitude sites along the Chilean coast. This finding confirms that coastal meteorological station data in this region do not reliably reflect recent temperature trends at high altitudes. Moreover, it implies a southward shift of the northern border of the Westerlies wind belt. This study clearly illustrates the importance of quantitative, high resolution studies from remote sites, in particular at high elevation mountain areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Merino, RS; Benítez, MYF; Estrada, AM				Sanchez Merino, Regina; Fermin Benitez, Miriam Y.; Mendoza Estrada, Anglica			Selectivity of zooplankton and trophic overlap between size Menidia humboldtiana fish (Atheriniformes: Atherinopsidae) in the reservoir Danxho, Mexico.	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Selectivity of zooplankton and trophic overlap between size Menidia humboldtiana fish (Atheriniformes: Atherinopsidae) in the reservoir Danxho, Mexico.The Menidia humboldtiana silverside is considered one of the most important species in fisheries in some states of Mexico. Knowing the choice that this species exercises over its food gives us all understanding of the behavior of zooplankton in presence of zooplanktonic fish, and tells us if the silverside choose amongst bigger prey fish, and if there is competition for food between the native and introduced fish in the reservoir. The purpose of this study was to determine if M.. humboldtiana selects its food, and in which genera, and to establish whether there was all overlap in the diet of the different sizes of silverside. The fish were catched with a 88 mm mesh net, in six sampling points during one year, from Danxho (19 degrees 5'17 '' - 53'46 '' N, 99 degrees 32'42 '' - 35'40 '' W) reservoir. Samples of filtered zooplankton were also taken with a 125 micron net, The analysis of stomach contents was carried out in fish grouped by regular size intervals during each season of the year, using the volumetric method and Chesson's selectivity coefficient. To evaluate the trophic overlap between the different size groups, the Morisita index, modified by Horn, was used. The zooplankton community was represented by twelve genera: Mastigodiaptomus and Cyclops (Copepoda); Bosmina, Diaphanosoma, Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, Moina. Alonopsis and Camptocercus, (Cladocera): Asplanchna, Conochillus and Filinia (Rotifera). Mastigodiaptomus was the most abundant throughout the year. The silverside consumed only four genera: Bosmina, Mastigodiaptomus. Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia; the group measuring 5 to 8.9 cm consumed a high percentage of Bosmina, Mastigodiaptomus and Daphnia, and a lesser percentage of Ceriodaphnia. The larger fish (9 to 10.9 cm) consumed only Mastigodiaptomus and Daphnia. In accordance with the selectivity value,, the small and medium size silverside selected their prey, with more intensity on the genera Bosmina and Daphnia, while the bigger fish concentrated on Daphnia and Mastigodiaptomus. During spring, the silverside between 3 to 8.9 cm showed overlap in diet; in summer the bigger size group (7-10.9 cm) showed the overlap. In autumn the overlap ocurred in all sizes, and in winter it was shown only in the medium size fish (5-8.9 cm), Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (1-2): 187-194.

J	TAMISIER, A; BOUDOURESQUE, C				TAMISIER, A; BOUDOURESQUE, C			AQUATIC BIRD POPULATIONS AS POSSIBLE INDICATORS OF SEASONAL NUTRIENT FLOW AT ICHKEUL LAKE, TUNISIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Ichkeul is fed in autumn and winter by 7 main freshwater oueds (rivers) which create an overflow towards the mediterranean sea. Conversely, seawater enters the lake after the end of the rainy season. Thus, strong inverse variations occur twice a year both in water depth and salinity level, with a major hydraulic flow to the sea between October and January. Waterbirds exploit the lake (ca 50 species belonging to 13 families) with a marked seasonal variation in specific richness and diversity; in winter, population size (200000 ducks, coots and geese) and biomass are much higher: 92.2% of the trophic impact occurs between October and March, because of both numbers and size of the wintering birds. The bird community is phytophagous for 96.2% of its annual biomass. The data, related to the hydraulic regime of the lake, support the hypothesis of an energetic input (N and P) which is mostly linked to the freshwater flow and an export brought about by migrating birds and the harvesting of fish. Nutrients would be a limiting factor for both plant and animal communities, Ichkeul being an atypic (rather oligotrophic) mediterranean lake. New dams around the lake (for drinking and irrigation water) are changing drastically this energetic balance and will lead to an important loss of the main characteristics of the lake, making Ichkeul an ordinary man-managed wetland.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						149	156		10.1007/BF00027849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027849													WOS:A1994NK39900015
J	Kowalczewska-Madura, K; Goldyn, R; Dera, M				Kowalczewska-Madura, Katarzyna; Goldyn, Ryszard; Dera, Martyna			Spatial and seasonal changes of phosphorus internal loading in two lakes with different trophy	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Two lakes with different trophy, Strzeszynskie Lake and Uzarzewskie Lake (Western Poland), were studied in ex situ experiments with the aid of intact bottom sediment cores in order to analyse the internal loading as well as the spatial and seasonal changes of total phosphorus (TP) release from bottom sediments. It was stated that the TP release from a hypereutrophic Lake Uzarzewskie, despite its earlier restoration using iron treatment, was over 6 times higher than in a mesotrophic one. The observed values in both lakes were higher in the deepest part of the lake than in the littoral zone. TP release in Strzeszynskie Lake was very similar in all four seasons of the year with the maximum value of 2.8 mgP m(-2) d(-1) in winter. TP release did not exceed 1.3 mgP m(-2) d(-1) in the littoral zone and in winter its accumulation prevailed over release from bottom sediments. TP release in Uzarzewskie Lake was 44.7 mgP m(-2) d(-1) in autumn in the profundal zone and 6.8 mgP m(-2) d(-1) in the littoral zone. A domination of P accumulation in sediments over release was observed at both stations in winter (0.33 mgP m(-2) d(-1) in the deepest place and 0.62 mgP m(-2) d(-1) in the littoral). Knowledge of the internal loading of P in lakes allows managers to compare changes in human impact on the ecosystem and to design practical treatments for limiting their trophy and approaches to the management of restoration measures.

A series of climate downscaling experiments for the 1960's and 2000's decades were performed using the Weather Research and Forecast model at 12-km horizontal resolution. To quantify the impacts of the changing surface boundary condition, a set of simulations with an identical lateral boundary condition but different extents of the Aral Sea were performed. It was found that the desiccation of the Aral Sea leads to more snow (and less rain) as desiccated winter surface is relatively much colder than water surface. In summer, desiccation led to substantial warming over the Aral Sea. These impacts were largely confined to within the area covered by the former Aral Sea and its immediate vicinity, although desiccation of the Sea also led to minor cooling over the greater Central Asia in winter. A contrasting set of simulations with an identical surface boundary condition but different lateral boundary conditions produced more identifiable changes in regional climate over the greater Central Asia which was characterized by a warming trend in both winter and summer. Simulations also showed that while the desiccation of the Aral Sea has significant impacts on the local climate over the Sea, the climate over the greater Central Asia on inter-decadal time scale was more strongly influenced by the continental or global-scale climate change on that time scale.

In April 2002, radio transmitters were attached to the back of 19 female Indiana bats as they emerged from a hibernaculum in northeastern New York. Thirty-nine roost trees were found in the vicinity of the Lake Champlain Valley of New York and Vermont over the span of 224 bat days (i.e., 1 bat located for 1 d equals 1 bat day). Distances from hibernaculum to roost trees ranged from 14.6 to 40.0 km (mean = 26.9 km). Shagbark hickory (Carya ovata) was the most common (33.3% of all trees, 39.7% of all bat days) of 11 tree species used. Roost trees had a mean diameter of 45.6 cm, were 18.9 m tall and ware similar in structure to those used during summer by Indiana bats elsewhere in their range. This study provides the first large-scale examination of trees used by female Indiana bats after spring emergence, supplying critical life history information useful for the conservation of this species.																			0003-0031					JAN	2006	155	1					181	187		10.1674/0003-0031(2006)155[0181:DOSRTU]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2006)155[0181:DOSRTU]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000234902500016

This paper therefore investigates: (1) the impacts of hydro-climatically varying years on river ice development in a Scandinavian subarctic meandering river and (2) the accuracy of existing analytical models for predicting ice thickness growth and ice decay. Stefan's ice growth equation (version by Michel et al.) and Bilello's ice decay equation are applied to varying hydro-climatic conditions experienced in the years 2013-2019. Estimates from these equations are compared with observed field conditions such as ice thicknesses, ice clearance dates and freeze-thaw days. Overall, the equations were most accurate in the winter of 2016-2017 when the maximum mid-winter snow thickness value was high, the number of freeze-thaw days was the closest to the long-term average of northern Scandinavia, and the rate of thermal snow-melt in the subsequent spring was slow. The equations would need to be adjusted to take into account expected future changes to conditions such as shorter winters, less snow formation and increased frequency of air temperatures crossing 0 degrees C.

Meteorological conditions during dust (PM10) emission from a tilled loam soil: Identifying variables and thresholds	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Soil wind erosion and consequent PM10 emission is a complex process that has been related to surface properties and meteorological conditions. Most of the studies have emphasized on the relationship between the surface conditions and the dust emission, in general on deserts and dry lakes or playas. Little is known about the influence of meteorological variables on PM10 emission from agricultural soils. The objective of this study was to identify the most important meteorological variables involved in the emission of PM10, identify their threshold values, and to analyze their interaction with the soil surface conditions. Measurements were made on a loam soil (Entic Haplustoll) in the semiarid Argentinian Pampa. Horizontal mass transport (Q) and PM10 emission were measured during two years on a bare and flat surface that was tilled periodically. The meteorological variables measured were: average and maximum wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity and soil temperature. In 30% of the events, the PM10 concentration at 1.8 m height exceeded the average values allowed by the World Health Organization (50 mu g m(-3) for a 24 h period). Maximum values exceeded 1000 mu g m(-3). The slope of the PM10 concentration gradient changed between spring summer and autumn winter periods. Threshold values of the studied variables were set when PM10 concentration values at 1.8 m height were consistently above the 50 mu g m(-3) limit. The highest PM10 emission rates were observed when relative humidity values were below 20% and the air temperature was higher than 30 degrees C. In addition when the wind speed exceeded 8 m s(-1), dust emission increased significantly. From a multiple regression analysis, results indicated that PM10 emission was well correlated (p < 0.001) with maximum wind speed, relative humidity, and air temperature. Maximum wind speed and relative humidity conditioned the PM10 emission in a synergistic way. However, the regression explained only 32% of the variability. Although higher average PM10 emission values were measured during events with a crusted surface, lower average values of Q were measured during events with a crust. Field observations indicated that the complex interaction between the weather conditions and soil surface properties such as soil crusts, aggregate size distribution, soil moisture and even the soil condition when the tilling is done, can produce a high variability and unpredictability, of the PM10 emission from bare agricultural soils.

The lakes are eutrophic with high values for water chemistry parameters and are rich in aquatic vegetation. A population of M. glutinosa in one of the lakes (Lake Bolstaholm) was monitored over two seasons. In spying, individuals live on rocks where they feed on epilithic algae and propagate, then die. In late summer the new generation hatches and is mainly found on leaves of water lilies. During this time they grow, feeding either on epiphytic algae or on decaying leaves. In late autumn, having reached their adult size, they descend to deeper water to hibernate.																			0022-0019					JAN	2001	37		2				105	117																WOS:000166814200001
J	Sheta, BM				Sheta, Basma M.			Biodiversity and habitat use of wintering and breeding waterbirds in Burullus Lake (Ramsar site), Egypt	CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The present study seeks to assess the bird biodiversity at the Important Bird Area (IBA) and Ramsar site, Lake Burullus, northern Egypt. Waterbirds biodiversity was assessed at 14 selected sites in the lake during winter and spring seasons. The assessment included richness, composition, evenness, abundance, and Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices. Bird species diversity varied spatially and temporally among different sites during the study period. Estimated species richness was 49 species. Winter birds were mainly migratory waterbirds like waterfowl, distributed in the islets for foraging, which was the main activity of 51% of total birds, followed by 36% roosting and 13% breeding at the lake. Evidence of breeding was recorded, such as collecting nest material, courtship behavior and food collecting for juveniles. The hierarchical cluster analysis separated the lake sites into four distinctive habitats: lake shores, open water, islets and reed beds. Seven bird species showed significant affinities with different habitat types: Laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis) favored the lake shores habitat (P< 0.04); Little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus) (P< 0.04), Pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis) (P< 0.04), Common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) (P< 0.02), Pied wagtail (Motacilla alba) (P< 0.04), and Graceful prinina (Prinia gracilis) (P< 0.01) were found in islands habitat. Little egret (Egretta garzetta) dominated the reed beds habitat group (P< 0.03). The results reflected the importance of Burullus Lake as a wintering and breeding habitat for birds and suggested that more implemented conservation and management strategies should be adopted.					; Sheta, Basma/ABF-9414-2020	The International Journal of Environmental Sciences, Catrina/0009-0004-0194-3219; The International Journal Of Environmental Science, Catrina/0009-0004-1760-3251													1687-5052	2090-2786				SUM	2019	19	1					47	+																WOS:000487555600005

Boreal forests play an important, but not well known, role in the global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. NOPEX (a NOrthern hemisphere climate Processes land surface EXperiment) is devoted to the study of land surface-atmosphere interaction in a northern European forest-dominated landscape. The main NOPEX region represents the southern edge of the boreal zone. It consists of a highly heterogeneous landscape, with forests, mires, agricultural land and lakes. A second study site, in northern Finland, representing the northern edge of the boreal zone, will be introduced into NOPEX in connection with its coming winter-time field activities. Field activities, dominating the initial phase of NOPEX, are conceived to strike a balance between the need to cover multi-annual observations and the resources required to carry out measurements covering all relevant spatial scales. The long-term data collection activities, the Continuous Climate Monitoring (CCM), form the backbone of the field programme. A suite of Concentrated Field Efforts (CFEs) covering periods of summer, spring and winter brings together scientists from more then 20 countries during month-long campaigns. CFEs have been carried out in May-June 1994 and April-July 1995. A third, winter-time CFE is planned for 1998-99. The System for Information in NOPEX (SINOP) is the database which forms a backbone for modelling and analysis work, dominating the second stage of NOPEX. A series of PhD courses are run in parallell to the research activities. Analysis and modelling are done in four interacting areas, including local-scale processes, meso-scale surface-atmosphere coupling and remote sensing techniques. The fourth area, regionalization methods, aims at bringing the previous three together in order to provide improved parameterization schemes for exchange of energy, momentum, water and CO2 between land and atmosphere in hydrological and meteorological models from the meso to the global scale.

Oligotrichs dominated numbers in both lakes. Subdominants in oligotrophic Lake Taupo included Askenasia, Pseudobalanion and Urotricha, and in eutrophic Lake Okaro Prorodon, Coleps, Urocentrum, Stenter and Spirostomum were important. Biomass was dominated by large predatory ciliates and Stenter in Lake Taupo, and Prorodon and Stentor in Lake Okaro. The importance of Prorodon and Stenter to ciliate biomass is unusual and has not been reported for northern hemisphere lakes. Small ciliates (<20 mu m) capable of consuming particles <2 mu m were a major component of the ciliate community in Lake Taupo. Peaks in ciliate abundance occurred at the same time in both lakes: in autumn, at the beginning of mixis and in spring. Ciliates were vertically stratified during mixis and stratification in both lakes. The effect was more pronounced during deoxygenation of the hypolimnion in Lake Okaro which excluded oligotrichs and introduced benthic ciliates. Ciliates were less abundant (mean 4000 1(-1) in Lake Okaro and 900 1(-1) in Lake Taupo) than in comparable northern temperate lakes. There was no correlation between the seasonal distribution of ciliates and chlorophyll a, primarily caused by a winter peak in chlorophyll a dominated by large species of phytoplankton in Lake Taupo, at a time when ciliate numbers were low. The only consistent, significant correlations were total ciliate numbers and individual species of ciliates with bacterial concentrations in both lakes and with picophytoplankton in Lake Taupo.																			0142-7873					JUL	1995	17	7					1479	1500		10.1093/plankt/17.7.1479	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/17.7.1479													WOS:A1995RQ69900005

Lake sturgeon seasonal movements in regulated and unregulated Missouri River tributaries	ECOHYDROLOGY												Spatio-temporal movement patterns of aquatic organisms drive many ecological processes. However, dams block migrations and alter the hydrologic and thermal regimes influencing movement behaviour of freshwater fishes. In North America, many recovering southern Lake Sturgeon populations occur in rivers with hydroelectric dams, but few studies have examined the impact of hydrologic alteration on their seasonal movements. We conducted a 3-year telemetry study of 96 adult and subadult Lake Sturgeon to compare their migratory responses to temperature and hydrology in adjacent regulated and unregulated tributaries of the Missouri River. Many other populations of Lake Sturgeon use tributaries primarily for spring spawning; however, in our study, Lake Sturgeon used Missouri River tributaries during 78% of the year. Differences in river size, hydrologic and thermal regimes in the regulated Osage River may have contributed to the greater year-round residency, later initiation, more frequent directional changes and longer duration of spring migrations compared to the unregulated Gasconade River. Lake Sturgeon made spring upstream migrations at temperatures of 13-19 degrees C and elevated discharges in both rivers. However, Osage River migrants responded less to changes in discharge or temperature during spring migrations, especially those that overwintered at upstream locations. Fall tributary migrations occurred in the Osage River at rising or high discharges but were uncommon in the Gasconade River. Our identification of the influences of abiotic variables on the timing, duration and extent of Lake Sturgeon seasonal migrations can help guide management of habitat and hydrology in regulated rivers to recover migratory fishes globally.																			1936-0584	1936-0592				JAN	2022	15	1							e2362	10.1002/eco.2362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2362		OCT 2021											WOS:000704503700001

We performed 20-d in situ cage exposures with these species to determine their relative sensitivities to field conditions. We also exposed fish in the laboratory to synthetic soft water, without added Al, to elevate possible effects of Al on sodium flux rates and pH toxicity. Exposures were in five streams: two with high pH (> 5.60) and low Al concentrations (< 80 mug/L) and three with low pH (usually between 5.0 and 5.5) and high Al levels (124-294 mug/L). Exposures were during two low-discharge fall periods, when pH tends to be seasonally higher and Al concentrations lower, and two relatively high-discharge spring seasons, when lower pH and higher Al concentrations are typical. Few fish died (generally < 10%) in the two streams that had higher pH and lower Al concentrations, whereas mortalities typically exceeded 20% and were as high as 100% during spring exposures in the streams with lower pH and elevated Al concentrations. All three species had higher mortality rates in spring, 20-100%, than in fall, 0-29%. Mottled sculpins and slimy sculpins had similar mortality rates and both had lower mortality rates than brook trout when exposed to similar conditions. We compared Na flux rates of mottled sculpins to those of brook trout in laboratory exposures at pH 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 to determine if low pH alone could account for mortality rates in the field. Because Na flux rates at pH 5.0, without added Al, were similar to flux rates of the controls for both species, high Al levels were believed to have contributed to the increased mortality observed in streams.																			0002-8487					JUL	1993	122	4					616	628		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0616:MOBTMS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0616:MOBTMS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LW05400010

Influence of fish farming in net cages on phytoplankton structure: a case study in a subtropical Brazilian reservoir	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												This study investigated the enrichment influence due to fish farming in net cages on the phytoplankton composition, density and diversity in two arms of a subtropical reservoir (Salto Caxias, Parana). There were no statistically significant differences in the phytoplankton composition and diversity, as well as for concentrations of nutrients among the handled treatment. The density values were higher during the summer. Richness and Shannon diversity values were low during the study period. The equitability values were high during the winter and low in the summer. Variations of phytoplankton community and nutrients were mainly influenced by seasonality. The absence of significant differences between the treatments was probably due to the small number of net cages and fish used, as well as to the hydrodynamics of the studied environments, which are influenced by upstream rivers inflows.

Water samples were also examined by epifluorescence microscopy for evidence of algal senescence and bacterial colonization of intact and damaged cyanobacterial filaments. A small percentage (2-20%) of bacterial activity was retained by filters with pore sizes .gtoreq. 1 .mu.m in epilimnetic samples. Epilimnetic samples also had a small percentage of cyanobacterial filaments, intact or damaged, which were visibly colonized by bacteria in summer and fall samples. A significant proportion (20 to 35%) of bacterial activity was retained by filters with pore sizes .gtoreq. 1 .mu.m in samples collected from the metalimnion and hypolimnion during late summer and fall. The proportion of damaged cyanobacterial filaments was higher in these samples than in those from the epilimnion or from those obtained early in the summer. The filaments in these samples were more heavily colonized by bacteria. Overall, particle-bound production accounted for only 2-19% of total bacterial production from April to Aug. in all water layers. It appears that the supply of colonizable particles (damaged cyanobacterial filaments) is an important factor affecting the level of particle-bound bacterial activity in this lake.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1985	49	3					501	504		10.1128/AEM.49.3.501-504.1985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.49.3.501-504.1985								16346744					WOS:A1985ACS8200005
J	Offenberg, JH; Baker, JE				Offenberg, JH; Baker, JE			Aerosol size distributions of elemental and organic carbon in urban and over-water atmospheres	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Aerosol mass size distributions of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) were measured to determine the extent to which carbon speciations within ambient aerosols differ between urban and over-water atmospheres. Samples were collected during twenty-one 12-h periods in urban Chicago and over Lake Michigan during the July 1994 and January 1995 sampling intensives. Total particle bound concentrations (sum of all size fractions) of elemental and organic carbon ranged from 0.15 to 0.96 and from 0.94 to 3.04 g m(-3), respectively. On average, organic material (OM = 1.4 x OC) accounts for 18% of the total aerosol mass collected, but ranges from 10% (over-water; winter) to 39% (urban, summer). With regard to individual size fractions, organic matter ranges from 3% ( > 12 mu m over-water, winter) to 49% (0.15-0.45 mu m, urban, summer) of the particulate matter mass in the size class. Geometric mean aerodynamic equivalent diameters (GMDs) range from 0.72 to 2.4 mu m for suspended particulate matter (Sigma-PM), from 0.52 to 1.4 mu m for EC, and from 0.60 to 1.9 mu m for OC. Elemental and organic carbon GMDs are larger in the urban atmosphere than over the water during winter, while this trend is not observed in C-PM. Furthermore, geometric standard deviations are larger at the urban location in January for both EC and QC, indicating broader size distributions of both species under winter conditions due to greater quantities of EC and OC in large particles.

The lakes were chosen to include both upland and coastal systems and those in proximity of human activity. Sampling was undertaken during April (late winter) and in July/August (summer). The lakes all proved to be oligotrophic with low DOC concentrations (<2 mg/l) and most were relatively light transparent (K-dPAR 0.13-0.26 m(-1)) but high inorganic particle loadings or wind-induced sediment resuspension significantly reduced light penetration in certain lakes. In the clear lakes/pools, a substantial proportion of incident UV-A and UV-B radiation often penetrated the entire water column. With short-wave radiation in High Arctic locations currently increasing the light penetration data presented here suggest that planktonic biota in the shallow lakes and pools will be subject to UV influence. Phytoplankton populations were sparse (1-3 mug chlorophyll-a/l) and virtually absent in winter with seasonal activity focussed on the short summer season. Evidence of under-ice planktonic activity was observed in only one lake. Patterns of microbial numbers and activity observed within and between lakes appeared to be related to lake volume, catchment features and high summer water temperatures (up to 15 degreesC). In particular, the proportion of viable (electron transport system activity) bacteria increased with temperature within each study system and a trend of increasing percentage viability was also seen in bacterioplankton along the relatively weak eutrophication gradient. Human disturbance of lake catchments in the vicinity of the village of Ny Alesund appeared to have influenced lake status and thus the microbial Populations and activity within these systems.

For each dead deer we determined age, sex, date, and causes of mortality. All of the fat measures were correlated to varying degrees. Generally all Fat measurements peaked in late autumn and subsequently began declining and reached their lowest levels in May. Fat content was negatively correlated with winter severity. Causes of mortality included predation, poaching. accidental. unknown, and auto-collisions. Predated annuals had lower bone marrow (-7.42 +/- 3.92) and (0.165 +/- 2.30 times lower back fiat and had higher amounts of kidney fat than those killed by vehicles (0.86 +/- 0.43).

The investigations covered the following 6 helophyte species, dominant in the lake littoral: Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., Glyceria aquatica (L.) Wahlb., Typha latifolia L., T. angustifolia L., Acorus Calamus L. and Schoenoplectus lacustris (L.) Palla. The helophytes used up to 3 m3 of water/1 m2 surface area of the community in the transpiration process during the growing season. Helophytes show maximum transpiration rate at noon, or an impeded transpiration rate at this time of the day, this feature depending on the species. During the growing season, the transpiration rate increases from spring until midsummer, and then towards the autumn it steadily decreases.																			0070-9557						1978	26	2					193	212																WOS:A1978FW20200002

G.; Altaweel, Mark			Mid-Holocene hydroclimatic optimum recorded in a stalagmite from Shalaii Cave, northern Iraq	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In Mesopotamia, climate is regarded as an important contributing factor to major socio-cultural transformations. However, the scarcity of Holocene paleoclimate reconstructions in this region impedes analysis of potential climate-human interactions. Furthermore, current hydroclimatic scenarios for Mesopotamia are predominantly based on oxygen isotope (518O) proxy records from the eastern Mediterranean, whereas the paleoclimatic significance of 518O remains debated. Here, we present a Holocene stalagmite multi-proxy record from Shalaii Cave in northern Mesopotamia. Based on stable isotope, trace element and strontium isotope measurements, our new Shalaii Cave record suggests that long-term changes in 518O were influenced by multiple factors, such as 518O changes of the source of moisture, amount and seasonality of rainfall. The Shalaii Cave trace element and strontium isotope records indicate rather dry conditions during the early Holocene and wettest conditions during the mid-Holocene. This mid-Holocene hydroclimate optimum at Shalaii Cave is in good agreement with other non-isotopic records from SW-Asia, such as pollen evidence for concurrent rapid forest expansion and peaking lake levels. The mid-Holocene hydroclimatic optimum is most likely related to an increase in the amount of spring precipitation related to the remote influence of the Indian summer monsoon (desert-monsoon mechanism) and spring insolation-driven weakening of the Arabian anticyclone. In particular the latter northward migration of the Arabian anticyclone in spring promoted a longer spring rainfall season.					; Ali, Diary/AEF-7070-2022	Morgan, Alistair/0009-0009-8934-7388; Altaweel, Mark/0000-0003-1807-3737													0277-3791	1873-457X				MAY 15	2025	356								109286	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109286	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109286		MAR 2025											WOS:001449316100001

We examined the grain size distribution of varved glaciolacustrine sediments as a proxy for estimation of the water depth and the duration of winter a period with diminished sediment input from the melting glacier and restricted water circulation due to ice cover. The particle size at the top of the winter layer is assumed to reflect the time available for a particle to settle from the top of water column during the winter before water mixing and new sediment input in spring. Glacial varves from Parnu Bay in SW Estonia, where a local varve chronology of 584 years was established previously is examined as a case study. X-ray absorption granulometer was used to determine the grain size distribution within 10 varves with 2-14 samples collected from each varve. The coarsest particle size found on top of the winter layer is calculated for each varve from measured grain size distributions using a novel methodology and compared to the reconstructed water depth of the Baltic Ice Lake to constrain the likely duration of the winter. A high variability of the constrained winter length with an average close to the duration of a calendar year was found. It is concluded that the coarsest particles on top of the winter layer have settled from intermediate depths due to water stratification, or less likely the actual water level was lower than reconstructed. We conclude that the methodology can be used to constrain environmental parameters in glacial lakes where varved sediments are formed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, we have a limited understanding of how the combination of plant communities and seasonality with soil physicochemical properties affects nutrient stoichiometry in wetland plants. In this study, we examined these factors in Carex thunbergii and soil across four types of plant communities dominant in the riparian zone of Shengjin Lake during the non-flooding periods of December 2020 and March 2021. In winter, the total foliar C, N, and P concentrations decreased along with an increase in plant coverage, which did not differ in spring. The C, N, C: P, and N: P of foliage significantly increased over the season, while soil C, N, C: P, and N: P significantly decreased over the season. Both in winter and spring, soil C and soil N decreased along with the increase of plant coverage. Our results suggest that both plant community and soil physicochemical properties have a significant influence on plant nutrient stoichiometry. This study improves our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of plant nutrients under different communities and soil physicochemical properties.

As precipitation radars cover both coastal land and ocean, we used the Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor System (MRMS) gauge-corrected precipitation product from 2018 to 2020 to evaluate three widely used satellite-based precipitation products over the U.S. coastal land versus the ocean (and the water over the Great Lakes). These products included the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH). The MRMS data showed a precipitation climatology difference between the coastal land and the ocean that was higher in the winter and lower in the summer and autumn. IMERG and CMORPH performed best over land and water, respectively, while PERSIANN was the most consistent in its performance over land versus water. Heavy precipitation was overestimated by the three products, with larger overestimates over water than over land. These results were not affected by the MRMS uncertainties due to the gauge correction or by the use of different versions.

J	Muhid, P; Burford, MA				Muhid, Priyanesh; Burford, Michele A.			Assessing nutrient limitation in a subtropical reservoir	INLAND WATERS												There is debate about the relative importance of controlling anthropogenic nitrogen (N) versus phosphorus (P) inputs to limit algal growth in lakes and reservoirs. Our study examined nutrient responses in a subtropical reservoir using short-term algal bioassays on 3 occasions, once during the austral winter and twice during the austral summer. Measurement of photosynthetic yield (Fv/Fm) was used to determine the response to nutrient addition. For the 2 summer sampling occasions, the photosynthetic yields of the N+P treatments were significantly higher than the control. At some sites and on some occasions there was a response to P or N alone, but there was no consistent pattern. The one winter sampling occasion had no response to nutrient addition. Overall, the magnitude of the photosynthetic yield of algal samples correlated with nitrate/nitrite (NO2-/NO3-) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations, but not with ammonium (NH4+), or dissolved organic N (DON) or P (DOP), despite relatively high concentrations of DON. Therefore we concluded that both N and P co-limited the growth of phytoplankton in the 2 austral summer sampling occasions. This contrasted with high N: P ratios and low P concentrations observed, which suggested that the reservoir was most likely to be P limited. This study highlights the importance of determining algal responses to nutrients and measures nutrient concentrations and ratios to determine whether N or P should be controlled to prevent algal blooms.

Diversity and seasonal variation of copepod zooplankton in Manchhar lake (Distt: Dadu) Sindh, Pakistan	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The community analysis of copepod zooplankton was conducted at five sampling stations in sub-tropical, Manchhar lake during 2001. A total of 7 species of copepods were recorded including 4 species of Cyclopoida, two species of Calanoida and one species of Harpacticoida. Thermocyclops hylinus, Mesocyclops leuckerti, Heliodiaptomus cinctus and Onychocamptus mohammad are the new records from Pakistan. Total copepod population exhibited a distinct peak during early summer (April) due to suitability of temperature and availability of food. The population was lowest during winter months (October March). The genus Cyclops showed a peak in April, while their population was high during summer. Genus Diaptomus was low during the whole year with a small peak in October. Genus Onychocamptus exhibited a peak in June. The seasonal fluctuations are related to water temperature, food availability and reproductive activity of these zooplanktons.

Northward Migrations of Nonbreeding Bald Eagles from Arizona, USA	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												of the spatiotemporal patterns of migratory and nonbreeding-season movements by animals is critical for conservation, but can be difficult to obtain if animals move far from known breeding territories and across administrative and country borders. To understand the migratory movements of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) originating from a demographically closed population in Arizona, USA, we deployed GPS transmitters on 24 juveniles and 2 nonbreeding adult eagles between 2017 and 2023. We identified common migration routes, stopover locations, and migration phenology. Eagles moved north from Arizona during the population's post-breeding period in the boreal spring and summer, and returned south in autumn in advance of the breeding season. Eagles migrated along two primary routes: (1) along the Wasatch Mountains in Utah and extending into the Rocky Mountains of southern Idaho, and (2) through eastern Nevada and along the Rocky Mountains in western and northern Idaho. Stopover locations were frequently near lakes and rivers. Recent fledglings began migration later than older individuals and 15 of 16 of these juveniles that survived until the following breeding season returned to Arizona. The individual that did not return showed evidence of permanent emigration to northern California. Our results contribute to a growing understanding of avian migration routes within the Pacific Flyway and the diverse migration strategies, including northward migration following the breeding season, exhibited across raptor populations. We highlight that explicit studies of juveniles, subadults, and nonbreeding adults are key to understanding avian migration dynamics and identifying opportunities for conservation.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				SEP	2025	59	3							jrr2450	10.3356/jrr2450	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/jrr2450													WOS:001550480700013

Autumnal increase in proportion of toxic Microcystis in Lake Taihu depends more on temperature adaptability than on effects of toxigenicity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												AimsToxic Microcystis strains have selective advantages over nontoxic strains under certain conditions. This study was undertaken to analyse whether fluctuations of toxic/nontoxic ratio in Microcystis population are based on effects of toxigenicity. Methods and ResultsAnnual Microcystis population dynamics was investigated by sequencing of gvpAC-IGS libraries and qPCR analysis of mcyA. gvpAC-IGS type 1 dominated the Microcystis population in Lake Taihu in seasons except autumn, while types 6, 9 and 10 and mcyA copies in total Microcystis rapidly increased in autumn and decreased in winter. Isolated type 6 was found to be toxic, while types 1, 9 and 10 were nontoxic. Physiological characterization and co-cultures indicated that type 1 was favoured at lower temperatures when competing with types 6, 9 and 10. ConclusionsThe rapid increase in proportion of toxic Microcystis was probably based on the same mechanism as that for other nontoxic strains to arise in total Microcystis. Fluctuations of toxic/nontoxic ratio are not necessarily due to effects of toxigenicity. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis is the first report that the dynamics of toxic/nontoxic Microcystis was investigated in combination with characterizations of multiple isolated strains. The results are useful in understanding Microcystis genotype succession.

J	Elp, M; Sen, F; Çetinkaya, O				Elp, Mahmut; Sen, Fazil; Cetinkaya, Osman			The problems encountered by fish populations living in Lake Van basin and their possible solutions.	SU URUNLERI DERGISI												This study was carried out to determine the problems effecting the fish populations in Lake Van Basin and to discuss some solutions for mitigation. Sand pits on the stream beds were determined as the biggest problem because they destroyed the bed structure and made the water turbid. The works of these sand pits had negative effects during the spawning migration of fish such as Chlacalburnus tarichi, Capoeta capoeta and Barbus plebejus ercisianus. In this period, the turbidity and the destruction of stream bed not only can affect negatively the brood stock but also caused mass destruction of eggs and larvae. During the spawning period in Lake Nazik, especially while Cyprinus carpio returned to spawning, it was observed that some suitable costal regions for spawning were encircled by trammel nets. Precipitation regime of Van Lake Basin was very variable. In some seasons (summer) aridness were observed whereas in some seasons (spring and autumn) floods were observed. Floods can very destructive to stream beds and banks; sometimes a large amount of original material can be carried away by erosion on stream bed and banks because of destruction of vegetation and misuse of the bed by sand pit works. Dam and regulators on the stream had been built without considering fish migration and there were no fish passes. It was determined that the biggest threatening problem on fish population were sand pits working on these streams that is prohibited by Fisheries act Nr. 1380. The sand pits works should be stopped or at least regulated. Regulator and the other constructions on the streams must be arranged to fish passes. This is essential for fish populations and sustainable fisheries.					Sen, Fazil/HGT-9366-2022														1300-1590	2148-3140					2006	23			3			407	412																WOS:000440355200019
J	Gelinas, Y; Schmit, JP				Gelinas, Y; Schmit, JP			Estimation of the bulk atmospheric deposition of major and trace elements to a rural watershed	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Despite the existence of many reports on the background deposition of contaminants in remote areas, very little is known about the total aerial inputs of major, and trace elements to the entire surface of rural watersheds. In this work, the influence of the contribution from local nonpoint-sources of emission or resuspension (e.g. agricultural soil and road dust resuspension, direct emission from vehicle use, and mall towns) on the background regional fluxes was evaluated in a small rural watershed of southern Quebec (Canada). A seasonal pattern was found for the background deposition of 28 major and trace elements, with spring and fall maxima as well as winter and midsummer minima mostly owing to agricultural practices and weather. The contribution from the Greater Montreal area, located 30 km to the west, was <5% of the background fluxes for all elements except Zn, Cu, Cd, and Mn. Although some of them do not constitute true inputs at the entire watershed level, a preliminary estimate of the local nonpoint-sources (e.g. agricultural soil resuspension, roads, small town) showed that the total aerial fluxes to the streams of the watershed could be considerably underestimated, owing mostly to agricultural soil resuspension source. Background-only deposition often represents a fraction of the total inputs to the waters of inhabited watersheds. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	ELMOSLIMANY, AP				ELMOSLIMANY, AP			ECOLOGY AND LATE-QUATERNARY HISTORY OF THE KURDO-ZAGROSIAN OAK FOREST NEAR LAKE ZERIBAR, WESTERN IRAN	VEGETATIO												The ecology and distribution of Quercus aegilops ssp. brantii and the associated Pistacia atlantica var. mutica and P. khinjuk are examined as a basis for explaining the Late Quaternary history of the forest in the Zagros mountains. The three species are tolerant of aridity and low temperatures but sensitive to heavy snowfall. In most of the area, summer rain does not occur. Forest expansion is generally limited by the inability of seedlings to survive the four-month summer drought. Pollen diagrams from Lake Zeribar, Kurdistan show the absence of trees during the last glacial period and the migration of forest into the region between 10,000 and 5,500 B.P. This has been interpreted as indicating aridity during the Pleistocene with gradually increasing precipitation in the late glacial and Holocene. However, the sensitivity of these species to snow and their tolerance of low overall precipitation implicate higher snowfall rather than lower precipitation as the cause of absence during the Pleistocene. The inability of seedlings to survive the present summer-dry conditions suggests that summer rainfall, and not higher total precipitation, was the factor that finally allowed migration. These conclusions are supported by independent evidence of increased winter precipitation during the pleniglacial and a period of summer rainfall but low annual precipitation during forest expansion.																			0042-3106					DEC 1	1986	68	1					55	63																WOS:A1986F471300006

The purpose of this study was to evaluate seasonal variation, spatial variation, and association with host age in the transmission of Tylodelphys barilochensis and T. crubensis in several oligotrophic lakes in Argentinian Patagonia. Fishes were captured monthly in Lake Gutierrez and bimonthly in Lake Escondido. One summer or autumn sample was also taken in several other Patagonian lakes. Infection parameters were calculated and compared using nonparametric tests. The 2 species co-occurred in most of the sampled lakes, with high values of prevalence and mean intensity. in Lake Guti6rrez and Lake Escondido, the intensity of both diplostomatid species did not show significant differences between sexes and co-varied with host length. All age classes were infected; maximum prevalence values were reached before maximum mean intensity values in the 1-yr age class. A seasonal pattern of prevalence and mean intensity of the 2 parasite species with autumn mean intensity values differing significantly from those of the other seasons was evident only in Lake Gutierrez.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				DEC	2002	88	6					1135	1139		10.1645/0022-3395(2002)088[1135:IPOTBA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/0022-3395(2002)088[1135:IPOTBA]2.0.CO;2								12537107					WOS:000180255000014

W.; Lowemark, Ludvig			East Asian winter monsoon variation during the last 3000 years as recorded in a subtropical mountain lake, northeastern Taiwan	HOLOCENE												The East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM) is a fundamental part of the global monsoon system that affects nearly one-quarter of the world's population. Robust paleoclimate reconstructions in East Asia are complicated by multiple sources of precipitation. These sources, such as the EAWM and typhoons, need to be disentangled in order to understand the dominant source of precipitation influencing the past and current climate. Taiwan, situated within the subtropical East Asian monsoon system, provides a unique opportunity to study monsoon and typhoon variability through time. Here we combine sediment trap data with down-core records from Cueifong Lake in northeastern Taiwan to reconstruct monsoonal rainfall fluctuations over the past 3000 years. The monthly collected grain-size data indicate that a decrease in sediment grain size reflects the strength of the EAWM. End member modelling analysis (EMMA) on sediment core and trap data reveals two dominant grain-size end-members (EMs), with the coarse EM 2 representing a robust indicator of EAWM strength. The downcore variations of EM 2 show a gradual decrease over the past 3000 years indicating a gradual strengthening of the EAWM, in agreement with other published EAWM records. This enhanced late-Holocene EAWM can be linked to the expansion of sea-ice cover in the western Arctic Ocean caused by decreased summer insolation.					; Chang, Yuan-Pin/C-1656-2009; Li, HongChun/AAJ-4053-2021; Dietze, Elisabeth/AFJ-4450-2022; Kaboth-Bahr, Stefanie/ABF-7573-2021; Löwemark, Ludvig/AEJ-2518-2022	Su, Chih-Chieh/0000-0002-7624-1607; Chang, Yuan-Pin/0000-0001-8147-7860; Yamoah, Afrifa Kweku Kyei/0000-0001-7488-0459; Dietze, Elisabeth/0000-0003-4817-8441; Burr, George/0000-0003-0068-7589; Li, Hong-Chun/0000-0001-9614-7119; Lin, Tsai-Wen/0000-0002-2244-3705; Yam, Rita S.W./0000-0001-8304-0320													0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	2021	31	9					1430	1442	09596836211019094	10.1177/09596836211019094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836211019094		MAY 2021											WOS:000657996400001
J	Schalau, K; Rinke, K; Straile, D; Peeters, F				Schalau, Kristine; Rinke, Karsten; Straile, Dietmar; Peeters, Frank			Temperature is the key factor explaining interannual variability of Daphnia development in spring:: a modelling study	OECOLOGIA												Plankton succession during spring/early summer in temperate lakes is characterised by a highly predictable pattern: a phytoplankton bloom is grazed down by zooplankton (Daphnia) inducing a clear-water phase. This sequence of events is commonly understood as a cycle of consumer-resource dynamics, i.e. zooplankton growth is driven by food availability. Here we suggest, using a modelling study based on a size-structured Daphnia population model, that temperature and not food is the dominant factor driving interannual variability of Daphnia population dynamics during spring. Simply forcing this model with a seasonal temperature regime typical for temperate lakes is sufficient for generating the distinctive seasonal trajectory of Daphnia abundances observed in meso-eutrophic temperate lakes. According to a scenario analysis, a forward shift of the vernal temperature increase by 60 days will advance the timing of the Daphnia maximum on average by 54 days, while a forward shift in the start of the spring bloom by 60 days will advance the Daphnia maximum only by less than a third (17 days). Hence, the timing of temperature increase was more important for the timing of Daphnia development than the timing of the onset of algal growth. The effect of temperature is also large compared to the effect of applying different Daphnia mortality rates (0.055 or 0.1 day(-1), 38 days), an almost tenfold variation in phytoplankton carrying capacity (25 days) and a tenfold variation in Daphnia overwintering abundance (3 days). However, the standing stock of Daphnia at its peak was almost exclusively controlled by the phytoplankton carrying capacity of the habitat and seems to be essentially independent of temperature. Hence, whereas food availability determines the standing stock of Daphnia at its spring maximum, temperature appears to be the most important factor driving the timing of the Daphnia maximum and the clear-water phase in spring.

As several processes usually take place simultaneously or consecutively, so distinguishing between the impact of each one of them individually on cliff erosion is impossible. Jeziorsko Reservoir is characterized by large fluctuations of water level in the annual cycle (several metres), hence in winter, when the water level in the reservoir is the lowest, the exposed cliff is not directly influenced by wave erosion. Sediments resulting from freeze-thaw action are accumulated at the bluff toe. However, in early spring, when freeze-thaw processes are continued, the water level in the reservoir is elevated, reaching the bluff toe. Wave erosion in that period causes removal of the material accumulated at the bluff toe and, consequently, cliff degradation. These processes interact In 2015, the normal water level in the reservoir was lowered by 0.5 m leaving the bluff toe unaffected by wave erosion also in spring and summer months. These conditions enabled us to distinguish between the effects inflicted by freeze-thaw action and other sub-aerial geomorphological processes and wave erosion on cliff recession. This paper summarizes a series of detailed terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements of morphological changes in an active cliff developing in coherent deposits in the temperate zone, resulting from freeze-thaw processes. Held research was conducted in 2014-2015 and 2018. The results of this study indicate that in coherent deposits in the temperate zone freeze-thaw action plays an important role among sub-aerial geomorphological processes such as wetting and drying of the surface sediments, linear erosion or mass movements causing cliff recession.

Recently, various climate-induced changes have been observed in arctic tundra ecosystems, e.g. shrub expansion, resulting in reduction in albedo and greater C fixation in aboveground vegetation as well as increased rates of soil C mobilization by microbes. Importantly, the net effects of these shifts are unknown, in part because our understanding of belowground processes is limited. Here, we focus on the effects of increased snow depth, and as a consequence, increased winter soil temperature on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities in dry and moist tundra. We analyzed deep DNA sequence data from soil samples taken at a long-term snow fence experiment in Northern Alaska. Our results indicate that, in contrast with previously observed responses of plants to increased snow depth at the same experimental site, the ECM fungal community of the dry tundra was more affected by deeper snow than the moist tundra community. In the dry tundra, both community richness and composition were significantly altered while in the moist tundra, only community composition changed significantly while richness did not. We observed a decrease in richness of Tomentella, Inocybe and other taxa adapted to scavenge the soil for labile N forms. On the other hand, richness of Cortinarius, and species with the ability to scavenge the soil for recalcitrant N forms, did not change. We further link ECM fungal traits with C soil pools. If future warmer atmospheric conditions lead to greater winter snow fall, changes in the ECM fungal community will likely influence C emissions and C fixation through altering N plant availability, fungal biomass and soil-plant C-N dynamics, ultimately determining important future interactions between the tundra biosphere and atmosphere.

Lake Kastoria is a polymictic lake, characterized by both urban and agricultural activities. It has an area of 27.9 Km(2) and is located in the northwestern part of Greece. Forests and semi natural areas are characterized as dominant land use type (52%) in the lake's watershed (281 km2) followed by agriculture areas (39%). Urban land covers 2% of the lake's watershed. The lake's water retention time varies due to hydraulic adjustments of its outflow to Gioli torrent. Water samples were collected monthly from 5 sampling sites. The average of the measured values in all sampling sites, was estimated and the seasonal variation is demonstrated. The sequence of dominant zooplankton species groups in Lake Kastoria was Rotifera > Copepoda > Cladocera. Correlation between zooplankton species and nutrient level was established. The chlorophyll-a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass, reached its maximum during the summer period. The values of total P and total N were also in high values in early spring and early autumn. Concerning chlorophyll-a and TSI indexes values, the trophic status of Lake Kastoria varied from eutrophic to hypertrophic depending on the season. The present study was to investigate the composition and abundance of species of zooplankton in the coastal zone of Lake Kastoria. The diversity of zooplanktonic organisms in lake ecosystem worldwide is a "key" factor of the biological and ecological status of the lake, as links the functioning of the ecosystem, the complexity of the food web and ecosystem stability.

Four helminth species were recorded: the trematodes Aphalloides coelomicola Dollfus, Chabaud & Golvan, 1957 in the body cavity (P 59.14%, MI 8.64, MA 5.11) and Paratimonia gobii Prevot & Bartoli, 1967 from the intestine (P 58.60%, MI 35.82, MA 20.98), the monogenean Gyrodactylus bubyri Osmanov, 1965 from the skin, fins and gills (P 50.54%, MI 13.46, MA 6.80) and the nematode Contracaecum sp. (third-stage larvae) from the body cavity (P 1.61%, MI 1.00, MA 0.01). Based on their total prevalence values, A. coelomicola, P. gobii and G. bubyri are recognised as common species and Contracaecum sp. is considered a rare species at the component community level. The helminth component communities and infracommunities studied are characterised by a smaller species richness than those recorded in the same host species from two other (brackish) localities in the Black Sea basin.

J	Nurnberg, GK				Nurnberg, GK			Prediction of annual and seasonal phosphorus concentrations in stratified and polymictic lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phosphorus (P) concentrations in lakes are summarized and reported in different ways. Annual whole lake P (P-ann), epilimnetic summer P (P-epi), and mixed water column P during fall turnover after summer stratification (P-fell) were investigated with data from up to 150 lakes. Differences between P averages are caused by temporal variation in thermal stratification and the size of internal P sources. To predict various P averages in specific lake types, I combined a P retention model that predicts annual retention due to sedimentation (R-pred) with external and internal load estimates (L-ext, L-int) in a steady-state, P mass balance approach. Retention of internal and external loads in stratified and polymictic lakes can be predicted by the same model, R-pred = 15/(18 + q(s)), where q(s) is annual water load (m yr(-1)). However, lakes with chemically enhanced P coprecipitation (e.g., with calcium) are an exception. P averages can be predicted in stratified lakes, as P-ann = (L-ext + gross L-int)/q(s)(1 - R-pred) P-epi = L-ext/q(s)(1 - R-pred), although P-epi is overestimated in lakes with oxic hypolimnia. P concentrations can be approximately predicted in polymictic lakes as (L-ext + in-situ L-int)/q(s)(1 - R-pred) less than or equal to P-ann = P-epi less than or equal to L-ext/q(s)(1 - R-pred) + in-situ L-int/q(s).

Age-related differences in fall migration timing and performance of juvenile and adult Wood Thrushes departing from a breeding site	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Juvenile passerines are expected to have lower migration performance than adults due to their inexperience with long-distance flights and morphological limitations, such as shorter wing length. From 2016 to 2019 we radio-tagged nestling and adult Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) at a breeding site in southwestern Ontario and used the automated Motus Wildlife Tracking System to test if age class predicts timing of the onset of fall migration (date, time of night), flight speed during the initial migration flight across Lake Erie, and overall pace of migration southward through the eastern United States. We detected 60/117 (51%) adults and 82/119 (69%) juveniles departing the breeding area as they initiated fall migration. Compared with adults, juveniles departed at an earlier date in fall and later time in the evening. When crossing Lake Erie on their first migratory flight juveniles travelled about 25% slower than adults but this was due primarily to adults making better use of tailwinds. When travelling south through the eastern U.S. juveniles had a slower overall migration pace (47.3 +/- 5.1km/day) than adults (71.6 +/- 4.7km/day). Although we found evidence that juvenile Wood Thrushes have an earlier and slower fall migration than adults, identifying the proximate and ultimate mechanisms remains a challenge. There is no evidence that juvenile Wood Thrushes are inefficient in migration flight or refueling at stopovers, and it is unlikely that the fall migration pace in this species affects their ability to compete for wintering food resources. More tracking studies from breeding sites are needed to understand the ecological factors favouring and biological significance of, age-related differences in migration performance.																			2051-3933					MAY 6	2025	13	1							32	10.1186/s40462-025-00556-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-025-00556-3								40329419					WOS:001482772800001

Beech Leaf Disease Severity Affects Ectomycorrhizal Colonization and Fungal Taxa Composition	JOURNAL OF FUNGI												Beech leaf disease (BLD) is an emerging forest infestation affecting beech trees (Fagus spp.) in the midwestern and northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. BLD is attributed to the newly recognized nematode Litylenchus crenatae subsp. mccannii. First described in Lake County, Ohio, BLD leads to the disfigurement of leaves, canopy loss, and eventual tree mortality. Canopy loss limits photosynthetic capacity, likely impacting tree allocation to belowground carbon storage. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are root symbionts, which rely on the photosynthesis of autotrophs for nutrition and growth. Because BLD limits tree photosynthetic capacity, ECM fungi may receive less carbohydrates when associating with severely affected trees compared with trees without BLD symptoms. We sampled root fragments from cultivated F. grandifolia sourced from two provenances (Michigan and Maine) at two timepoints (fall 2020 and spring 2021) to test whether BLD symptom severity alters colonization by ectomycorrhizal fungi and fungal community composition. The studied trees are part of a long-term beech bark disease resistance plantation at the Holden Arboretum. We sampled from replicates across three levels of BLD symptom severity and compared fungal colonization via visual scoring of ectomycorrhizal root tip abundance. Effects of BLD on fungal communities were determined through high-throughput sequencing. We found that ectomycorrhizal root tip abundance was significantly reduced on the roots of individuals of the poor canopy condition resulting from BLD, but only in the fall 2020 collection. We found significantly more ectomycorrhizal root tips from root fragments collected in fall 2020 than in spring 2021, suggesting a seasonal effect. Community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi was not impacted by tree condition but did vary between provenances. We found significant species level responses of ectomycorrhizal fungi between levels of both provenance and tree condition. Of the taxa analyzed, two zOTUs had significantly lower abundance in high-symptomatology trees compared with low-symptomatology trees. These results provide the first indication of a belowground effect of BLD on ectomycorrhizal fungi and contribute further evidence to the role of these root symbionts in studies of tree disease and forest pathology.

J	Leconte, R; Peters, D; Pietroniro, A; Prowse, T				Leconte, Robert; Peters, Daniel; Pietroniro, Alain; Prowse, Terry			Modelling climate change impacts in the Peace and Athabasca catchment and delta: II - variations in flow and water levels with varying winter severity	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												As freshwater ice is known to significantly affect flows and water levels within the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), a winter severity sensitivity analysis using a one-dimensional open channel hydraulic model was performed for four climate scenarios (from mild to severe), and was examined under three differing flow conditions (low, average, and high hydraulic regimes), in an effort to better understand the multiple interactions between ice cover and the hydrodynamic regime of this complex system characterized by overbank flooding and flow reversal episodes. In general, a reduction of winter severity lowered lake levels and river flows. While the winter severity effect is of relatively short duration in the rivers, the subsequent reduction in lake levels extends over the summer months. High river flows predispose flow reversal conditions, and water enters the lakes at the outlet as the water levels in the rivers feeding the PAD increase significantly over a short period of time. This flow reversal effect is suppressed during milder winters. Numerical modelling results indicate that extending the ice-cover season (severe winter) by 14 days resulted in an increase of up to 5 cm in water level of large takes in the PAD, while reducing it by 28 days lowered the levels by almost 10 cm. Short-term variations in river levels reached up to 1.5 m as a result of varying the extent of the ice-cover season. As the simulation runs did not consider ice-jam events and neglected the effect of ice thickness on water levels, the reported quantitative results must be interpreted with prudence.

J	Jackson, JR; Hightower, JE				Jackson, JR; Hightower, JE			Reservoir striped bass movements and site fidelity in relation to seasonal patterns in habitat quality	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Adult striped bass Morone saxatilis perform best when water temperatures are below 26degreesC and dissolved oxygen levels are above 2 mg/L and will begin to exhibit stress responses at higher temperatures or lower oxygen levels. In southern U.S. reservoirs, summer conditions may result in a reduction of suitable habitat for adult striped bass and therefore influence population dynamics and distribution. We tracked 51 adult striped bass that had been implanted with individually coded sonic transmitters for 2 years in Lake Gaston, Virginia-North Carolina, to determine the impact of habitat availability on seasonal trends in movement and distribution. Monthly movement rates of individual fish averaged 7,340 m (SE = 544 m) over the course of the study, and no significant differences in movement rates were detected among seasons or between sexes. Striped bass were relocated throughout the reservoir in all seasons despite evidence of spatial variability in the availability of suitable habitat during the summer months. Individual striped bass tended to occupy specific reservoir areas in all seasons and years of the study, with the exception of spring spawning runs. Home ranges of individual fish were not clearly related to the availability of summer habitat refuges but tended to be located in large, downlake basins or near the tailrace of an upstream dam. Fidelity of striped bass to limited areas within the reservoir suggests that spatially explicit management strategies are appropriate for reservoir populations of striped bass.

J	Schüller, I; Belz, L; Wilkes, H; Wehrmann, A				Schueller, Irka; Belz, Lukas; Wilkes, Heinz; Wehrmann, Achim			Late Quaternary shift in southern African rainfall zones: sedimentary and geochemical data from Kalahari pans	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												Continuous sedimentary archives that allow paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions are rare in regions with a markedly and climate. This study demonstrates the potential of southwestern Kalahari pans in their function as valuable geoarchives based on the survey of five different pans in Namibia and South Africa. Our sedimentological investigations and comprehensive C-14 dating of core material reveal that pans contain an up to few meters thick sedimentary filling of siliciclastic and evaporitic sediments. An age-depth model was developed for each of the studied pans indicating a quasi-continuous accumulation of sediments since the Late Pleistocene. Sedimentary processes in the pans are mainly controlled by local runoff, evaporation and to a minor degree by aeolian transport resulting in a net accumulation. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses reveal the shift and/or extension of monsoonal summer and westerlies-driven winter rain. Elevated sedimentation rates during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in some of the pans indicate an expansion of the winter rainfall belt, which is caused by Antarctic sea ice expansion. Post-LGM climate changes were induced by large-scaled spatial fluctuations of summer and winter rain that resulted in varying precipitation intensities and wind strengths. The detailed study of the paleoenvironmental information recorded in these sedimentary archives provides unique insights into the response of the southwestern Kalahari to past climatic changes and enabled an improved spatial and temporal resolution of existing models of past rainfall zone shifts in southern Africa.																			0372-8854					JUN	2018	61	4					339	362		10.1127/zfg/2018/0556	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/zfg/2018/0556													WOS:000437255700005
J	Gottstein Matocec, S; Kuzman, A; Kerovec, M				Gottstein Matocec, S; Kuzman, A; Kerovec, M			Life history traits of the grass shrimp Palaemonetes antennarius (Decapoda, Palaemonidae) in the delta of the Neretva River, Croatia	LIMNOLOGICA												The life history of the freshwater shrimp Palaemonetes antennarius (H. Milne Edwards, 1837) was investigated from April 1993 to November 2002 at 13 sites in the delta of the Neretva River, Croatia. The sex ratio (males vs. females) was in favour of females throughout the study year ((x) over bar +/- SD = 0.70 +/- 0.12). The breeding period lasts from April to August with a peak of 75% of the ovigerous female in June. The maximum number of eggs carried by ovigerous females was 73, and there was a positive significant linear correlation between fecundity (number of early embryonic stage eggs per female) and female body size (carapace length) (R-2 = 0.698, p < 0.01). The breeding period was longer in limnocrenes and lakes with oligohaline-limnic water than in other habitat types because the water is more rapidly warmed in spring and cooled more slowly in autumn in these habitats. Larvae were present from June to October, with a peak reaching 19.4% of the total population in June. The shrimps follow a synchronic univoltine life cycle with a short egg-laying period and a new summer generation. Their larvae, apparently having no ecological flexibility, did not appear in any environment with high oscillations of salinity. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Peak immigration Of sockeye salmon fry into southern Lake Washington precedes the spring zooplankton bloom by 2-3 months. Zooplankton density, fish diet, and growth were sampled during winter and spring 2001, when a record 52.4 million fry entered the lake. Supplementary information on the distribution and dispersal of fry was collected in 2002 and 2003. We used bioenergetics modeling to estimate the temporal-spatial consumption by fry during early lake rearing. Cyclops bicuspidatus were dominant in the diet and zooplankton assemblage but declined from more than 30/L in late February and early March to fewer than 5/L during mid-March and early April. Fry ate significantly larger Cyclops than the average size in the lake; approximately 83% of the food items in the stomachs were larger than 0.8 mm, which was the minimum food item size. Hydroacoustics and midwater trawling surveys during 2002 and 2003 suggested that fry dispersed quickly over the southern half of the lake and used depths of 0-30 m. Under the most realistic scenarios for fry dispersal, feeding, and survival, total consumption of all prey by sockeye salmon fry represented 5% of the average monthly biomass of Cyclops during March and early April, when their availability was lowest. Potential bottlenecks in the availability of Cyclops only developed in simulations when fry were restricted to feeding in 0-10-m depths in the southernmost region of the lake. Despite the seemingly adequate food supply for sockeye salmon fry, other planktivores also consume significant fractions of the exploitable prey biomass, and the interannual availability of exploitable zooplankton varies considerably during winter and early spring. Either of these factors could impinge on the localized food supply for sockeye salmon and other species during some years and should be considered in the adaptive management of any enhancement program.					; Scheuerell, Mark/N-6683-2016	Sergeant, Christopher/0000-0002-3363-3213; Scheuerell, Mark/0000-0002-8284-1254													0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2004	133	4					1014	1032		10.1577/T03-093.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T03-093.1													WOS:000222708100016

By their consumption of microalgae, their role in the microbial loop, and even their movements in the biofilm, they improve the rejuvenation of this type of ecosystem and have an important function in the connectivity of interfaces. In this study, we approach diversity issues from the standpoint of morphofunctional traits of periphytic micro-meiofauna. We collected and coded morphofunctional characteristics for several micro-meiofauna species from the literature and from our own observations to create a micro-meiofauna morphofunctional traits database inspired by the model of Usseglio-Polatera et al. (Freshw Biol 43(2):175-205, 2001). This new database of traits may represent an interesting collaborative tool which could be used to improve knowledge on micro-meiofauna and their functional role in the biofilm. We used the information to explore variations in functional traits related to trophic activity among micro-meiofauna communities. Counting data were acquired from biofilms grown in a hypereutrophic pond (Aquitaine, France) in winter and in spring. Community-weighted means (CWM) computed using the database and counting data revealed Spring food web was more complex than winter food web.					; Neury-Ormanni, Julie/GVS-7857-2022; Morin, Soizic/J-1204-2019	Vedrenne, Jacky/0000-0001-9313-4283; Morin, Soizic/0000-0003-0360-9383; Neury-Ormanni, Julie/0000-0003-4711-4593													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2020	847	12			SI		2725	2736		10.1007/s10750-019-04120-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-019-04120-0		NOV 2019											WOS:000499606100001
J	Azuma, M; Motomura, Y				Azuma, M; Motomura, Y			Feeding habits of largemouth bass in a non-native environment: the case of a small lake with bluegill in Japan	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Little is known about the ecology of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides in non-native environments. The stomach contents of a total of 381 bass ranging from 21 to 283 mm TL in a small lake in Japan were examined monthly from April to November 1992 by the 'points' method. The proportion of bass with empty stomachs increased in larger fish. The principal foods of the bass regardless of size consisted of two numerically dominant gobiids, the trident goby, Tridentiger obscurus, and paradise goby, Rhinogobius giurinus. The young-of-the-year (YOY) bass fed exclusively and selectively on the abundant young of paradise goby. As they grew the bass also consumed fewer but larger trident goby. Bass of all sizes preferred these gobies from spring to autumn when several successive gobiid cohorts recruited from offshore and settled inshore. In contrast, YOY bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, of 10-20 mm TL were selected only during summer. Bass switched from zoo-planktivory to piscivory at 30-40 mm TL, much smaller than previously reported in their native range. Presumably because of the high availability and vulnerability of the gobies, the bass became piscivorous earlier and grew quickly. The gobies also allowed the bluegill to largely escape predation risk from the bass.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUN	1998	52	1-3					379	389		10.1023/A:1007476104352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007476104352													WOS:000075390200032
J	Straile, D; Adrian, R				Straile, D; Adrian, R			The North Atlantic Oscillation and plankton dynamics in two European lakes - two variations on a general theme	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Long-term data on water temperature, phytoplankton biovolume, Bosmina and Daphnia abundance and the timing of the clear-water phase were compared and analysed with respect to the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in two strongly contrasting lakes in central Europe. In small, shallow, hypertrophic Muggelsee, spring water temperatures and Daphnia abundance both increased more rapidly than in large, deep, meso/oligotrophic Lake Constance. Because of this, the clear-water phase commenced approximately three weeks earlier in Muggelsee than in Lake Constance. In Muggelsee, the phytoplankton biovolume during late winter/early spring was related to the NAO index. In Lake Constance, where phytoplankton growth was inhibited by intense downward mixing during all years studied, this was not the case. However, in both lakes, interannual variability in water temperature, in Daphnia spring population dynamics and in the timing of the clear-water phase, were all related to the interannual variability of the NAO index. The Daphnia spring population dynamics and the timing of the clear-water phase appear to be synchronized by the NAO despite large differences between the lakes in morphometry, trophic status and hushing and mixis regimes, and despite the great distance between the lakes (similar to 700 km). This suggests that a great variety of lakes in central Europe may possibly have exhibited similar interannual variability during the last 20 years.

The total number of taxa studied during the period was 148. Characteristic phytoplankton species were chrysophytes Uroglena sp., Chrysococcus spp., Dinobryon spp and diatoms Cyclotella spp. The results were analysed in relation to weather patterns and physico-chemical variables measured from the lake during the 2 years. The seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton were characterized by (1) maxima in total densities during autumn and minima in winter; (2) different species reaching maximum and minimum densities during different seasons; (3) close to equilibrium state during strong thermal stratification in 1997 with dominance of only a few taxa; and (4) two annual maxima in species diversity at the beginning of the thermal stratification and during the autumn overturn. According to canonical ordinations, calcium buffer capacity, nutrients and temperature all play a role in regulating algal biomass and species compositions. With regard to physical factors, the length of the mixing cycle, thermal stability of the water column and water temperature seem to have a major control over the plankton dynamics. The length of the ice-free season seems to be more decisive for biomass production than the thermal stability during this period, which, in turn, appears to affect the algal biodiversity.

Patterns of lake occupancy by fish indicate different adaptations to life in a harsh Arctic environment	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. For six fish species sampled from 86 lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain, Alaska, we examined whether lake occupancy was related to variables representing lake size, colonisation potential and/or the presence of overwintering habitat. 2. We found the relative importance of each factor for a given species could be related to its ecology and adult size. The three large-bodied migratory species, least cisco (Coregonus sardinella), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus), were influenced by factors associated with the likelihood of fish recolonising lakes, including whether the lakes had a stream connection. Of the large-bodied species, least cisco had the highest likelihood of occupancy (0.52 +/- 0.05) and models provided evidence that least cisco exhibit both migratory and resident forms. 3. Models for small-bodied fish differed among species, indicating different niches. Ninespine stickle-back (Pungitius pungitius) were the most widespread and ubiquitous of the species captured (occupancy probability = 0.97 +/- 0.01); they were captured in lakes that freeze to the bottom, suggesting that they disperse widely and rapidly after the spring freshet, including colonisation of sink habitats. Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis) had a lower occupancy (occupancy probability = 0.76 +/- 0.05) with a distribution that reflected tolerance to harsh conditions. Slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) had an occupancy probability of 0.23 +/- 0.06, with a distribution indicating its marine origin. 4. Based on these patterns, we propose an overall model of primary controls on the distribution of fish on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Harsh conditions, including lake freezing, limit occupancy in winter through extinction events while lake occupancy in spring and summer is driven by directional migration (large-bodied species) and undirected dispersal (small-bodied species).

Spatio-temporal variations and risk assessment of select heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Cr, Cd, and Pb) were investigated in water samples. During summer Mn (37.32 mu g/L), Fe (41.0 mu g/L), and Cd (1.18 mu g/L) concentrations were higher in the water samples, while the concentrations of Zn (86.12 mu g/L), Fe (42.0 mu g/L), and Pb (30.82 mu g/L) were dominant in winter. However, Cr exhibited elevated concentrations in both seasons. The health-risk assessment revealed that hazard quotient (HQ(ing)) and hazard index (HIing) values were near to the acceptable limit, indicating non-carcinogenic risk to the recipient via oral intake of water. The calculated values for chronical daily intake (CDI) were found in the order of Cr > Fe > Mn > Zn > Cd in summer and Zn > Fe > Cr > Pb > Mn > Cu during winter. The carcinogenic risk (CRing) via ingestion route for Cr, Cd, and Pb were noted higher than the acceptable limit (10). Multivariate statistical analysis such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) results revealed that natural processes and anthropogenic activities were the main sources of water contamination. The data provided in this study are considered essential for reservoir remediation. The results suggested that quick action should be taken to protect the drinking water integrity of the Siling reservoir watershed from the different nonpoint pollution sources, especially the application of agricultural fertilizers.

Since rainbow smelt growth was lower in the 1990s than in the 1960s, we considered diet changes as an explanation. A decrease in the proportion of zooplankton occurred in the summer (May-August) diet of two size classes (63-88 and 89-114 mm fork length) between 1961 and 1999. Within the zooplankton, the proportion of Bythotrephes increased. In spite of these changes, energy density (joules per gram) of the summer (June-August) diet has not changed since 1961. However, during the late-summer and fall, predation on Bythotrephes, and therefore the proportion of indigestible spines in the stomach, increases. Using bioenergetics models, we show that Lake Erie rainbow smelt could achieve 66%-155% greater growth between June and October if Bythotrephes spines were replaced with digestible prey items, resulting in end-of-season weights and lengths similar to the 1985-1990 period. Our results indicate that indigestible Bythotrephes spines may reduce growth by occupying space in the stomach but providing no nutritional value to the fish, thereby reducing the realized daily ration for rainbow smelt.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2005	62	1					145	152		10.1139/F04-175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F04-175													WOS:000227614100014

Year-Round and Long-Term Phytoplankton Dynamics in Lake Bonney, a Permanently Ice-Covered Antarctic Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lake Bonney (McMurdo Dry Valleys, east Antarctica) represents a year-round refugium for life adapted to permanent extreme conditions. Despite intensive research since the 1960s, due to the logistical constraints posed by 4-months of 24-h darkness, knowledge of how the resident photosynthetic microorganisms respond to the polar winter is limited. In addition, the lake level has risen by more than 3 m since 2004: impacts of rapid lake level rise on phytoplankton community structure is also poorly understood. From 2004 to 2015 an in situ submersible spectrofluorometer (bbe FluoroProbe) was deployed in Lake Bonney during the austral summer to quantify the vertical structure of four functional algal groups (green algae, mixed algae, and cryptophytes, cyanobacteria). During the 2013-2014 field season the Fluoroprobe was mounted on autonomous cable-crawling profilers deployed in both the east and west lobes of Lake Bonney, obtaining the first daily phytoplankton profiles through the polar night. Our findings showed that phytoplankton communities were differentially impacted by physical and chemical factors over long-term versus seasonal time scales. Following a summer of rapid lake level rise (2010-2011), an increase in depth integrated chlorophyll a (chl-a) occurred in Lake Bonney caused by stimulation of photoautotrophic green algae. Conversely, peaks in chl-a during the polar night were associated with an increase in mixotrophic haptophytes and cryptophytes. Collectively our data reveal that phytoplankton groups possessing variable trophic abilities are differentially competitive during seasonal and long-term time scales owing to periods of higher nutrients (photoautotrophs) versus light/energy limitation (mixotrophs).

Ice roads through lake-rich Arctic watersheds: Integrating climate uncertainty and freshwater habitat responses into adaptive management	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Vast mosaics of lakes, wetlands, and rivers on the Arctic Coastal Plain give the impression of water surplus. Yet long winters lock freshwater resources in ice, limiting freshwater habitats and water supply for human uses. Increasingly the petroleum industry relies on lakes to build temporary ice roads for winter oil exploration. Permitting water withdrawal for ice roads in Arctic Alaska is dependent on lake depth, ice thickness, and the fish species present. Recent winter warming suggests that more winter water will be available for ice-road construction, yet high interannual variability in ice thickness and summer precipitation complicates habitat impact assessments. To address these concerns, multidisciplinary researchers are working to understand how Arctic freshwater habitats are responding to changes in both climate and water use in northern Alaska. The dynamics of habitat availability and connectivity are being linked to how food webs support fish and waterbirds across diverse freshwater habitats. Moving toward watershed-scale habitat classification coupled with scenario analysis of climate extremes and water withdrawal is increasingly relevant to future resource management decisions in this region. Such progressive refinement in understanding responses to change provides an example of adaptive management focused on ensuring responsible resource development in the Arctic.

Uncertainty assessments and hydrological implications of climate change in two adjacent agricultural catchments of a rapidly urbanizing watershed	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Simcoe is the most important inland lake in Southern Ontario. The watershed is predominantly agricultural and under increasing pressure from urbanization, leading to changing runoff patterns in rivers draining to the lake. Uncertainties in rainfall-runoff modeling in tributary catchments of the Lake Simcoe Watershed (LSW) can be an order of magnitude larger than pristine watersheds, hampering water quality predictions and export calculations. Here we conduct a robust assessment to constrain the uncertainty in hydrological simulations and projections in the LSW using two representative adjacent agricultural catchments. Downscaled CGCM 3 projections using Al B and A2 emission scenarios projected increases of 4 C in air temperature and a 26% longer growing season. The fraction of precipitation falling as snow will decrease. Spring runoff is an important event in LSW but individual HBV best calibrated parameter sets under-predicted peak flows by up to 32%. Using an ensemble of behavioral parameter sets achieved credible representations of present day hydrology and constrained uncertainties in future projections. Parameter uncertainty analysis showed that the catchments differ in terms of their snow accumulation/melt and groundwater dynamics. Human activities exacerbate the differences in hydrological response. Model parameterization in one catchment could not generate credible hydrological simulations in the other. We cautioned against extrapolating results from monitored to ungauged catchments in managed watersheds like the LSW. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Chott Ech Chergui (Algeria), one of the biggest wetlands of the north African desert, presents extreme temperatures and salinity conditions. We initiated a physico-chemical and microbiological survey at seven sites encompassing various conditions (salt lakes, freshwater lakes and hot springs), through a one-year monthly sampling campaign. Four sites under the influence of the spring showed little temporal physio-chemical variation. Three sites displayed higher variation and the aridity level, high from late spring until autumn, was a strong predictor of water chemistry. We evidenced extremophile bacteria. Among 320 bacterial isolates tested for thermo-, acido- and alcalino- tolerance, 39, affiliated to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were successfully maintained and underwent physiological, biochemical and molecular characterizations. Thermotolerance was recorded up to 100 degrees C for a water isolate affiliated to Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Halotolerance was recorded up to 30% NaCl (w:v) for soil isolates affiliated to Salinicola zeshunii, Chromohalobacter beijerinckii and Virgibacillus halodenitrificans. Acido- and alcalo- tolerance were recorded for a pH range from 5 to 11 for several soil and water isolates affiliated to Exiguobacterium, Bacillus, Salinicola and Chromohalobacter genus. Our results comfort the interest of studying extremophile diversity in wetlands of the highly arid Sahara region.

Under conditions of adequate food and appropriate temperature, scallops grow well from the time of ice melting in April to harvesting starting in July. However, over the past decade, Saroma Lake frequently has not been completely covered by ice in winter, and the production of Japanese scallops has shown significant changes. Therefore, this study integrated data from satellite remote sensing, buoys, and insitu observations with climatic events [the winter East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Nino/La Nina-Southern Oscillation events] to investigate the impact of ice coverage variations on scallop growth in Saroma Lake between 2007 and 2015. Daily ice conditions were detected using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer false colour images and an unsupervised classification method. The results indicated that EAM strongly influenced the ice coverage variation in Saroma Lake through their effects on temperature during winter. Ice coverage variations show a strong correlation with water temperature and spring phytoplankton blooms, which are the two most important environmental factors for scallop growth. In addition, extreme climate events could cause water temperature anomalies (as in 2015) which are unfavourable for scallop growth. Monitoring ice conditions should be considered when developing plans and management strategies for scallop aquaculture in Saroma Lake.					; Liu, Yang/AAK-3617-2020	Liu, Yang/0000-0001-8548-0223; 													1355-557X	1365-2109				MAY	2018	49	5					1752	1767		10.1111/are.13630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.13630													WOS:000429410800003

Paired lots were stocked in April and October from the 1986 to 1991 year-classes. Survival and growth of fish from the two rearing practices were indexed as the relative abundance and length of 6-year-old lake whitefish captured with trap nets during fall spawning runs from 1992 to 1997. No difference in relative abundance or length between lake whitefish stocked at 6 months of age and those stocked at 12 months of age was detected. This contradicts results reported for many other fish species, which have exhibited greater survival rates when stocked as yearlings rather than fingerlings. As a result of these findings, all lake whitefish stocked into Lake Simcoe are stocked in the fall when the fish are 6 months of age, thus freeing up limited hatchery space for other purposes.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2004	24	4					1214	1220		10.1577/M03-047.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-047.1													WOS:000226080800010
J	Xu, YJ				Xu, Y. Jun			Total nitrogen inflow and outflow from a large river swamp basin to the Gulf of Mexico	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												River corridor wetland restoration and freshwater diversion from the lower Mississippi River are being considered as two major options to reduce nitrogen input to the Gulf of Mexico, However, it is largely uncertain how much nitrogen can actually be retained from the overflowing waters by these wetland systems. This study quantified the nitrogen inflow and outflow for the largest distributary basin of the Mississippi River, the Atchafalaya River Swamp basin. The goal of the study was to seek answers to three critical questions: (a) Does the Atchafalaya River Swamp remove a significant amount of nitrogen from the overflowing water, or is it releasing more nitrogen into the Gulp (b) How do the nitrogen removal or release rates fluctuate seasonally and annually? (c) What are the relationships between the nitrogen removal capacity and the hydrological conditions in the basin such as river stage and discharge? By utilizing the long-term (1978-2002) river discharge and water quality data, monthly and annual nitrogen fluxes were quantified, and their relationships with the basin hydrological conditions investigated. A total nitrogen-sum of the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen (NO3+NO2)-mass input-output balance between the upstream (Simmesport) and downstream (Morgan City and Wax Lake Outlet) locations was established to examine the nitrogen removal potential for this, the largest freshwater swamp basin in North America. The results from this study showed that, over the past 25 years, the Atchafalaya River Swamp basin acted as a source for NO3+NO2 nitrogen, although the average annual output of NO3+NO2 nitrogen (174 584 Mg) was only slightly higher (2.3%) than the average annual input of NO3+NO2 nitrogen (170 721 Mg). The higher NO3+NO2 mass outflow occurred throughout summer and autumn, indicating an active role of biological processes on nitrogen in the overflowing waters of the Atchafalaya. However, this swamp basin has served as a major sink for organic nitrogen: the annual averages of TKN mass input and output were 200 323 and 145 917 Mg year(-1), respectively, presenting a 27.2% removal rate by the basin. This large TKN reduction appeared high during springs and low during late summers, corresponding with the fluctuation of the hydrological conditions of the river.					Xu, Y./A-7681-2014; Xu, Y.

In order to promote investigations into this coupling, methods of characterising annual time series of phytoplankton were derived and applied to a 31-year data set from Saidenbach Reservoir (Saxony, Germany). Field data are often scarce and irregularly sampled, particularly in the transition period from winter to spring, so reliable methods of determining cardinal dates in the time series are necessary. The proposed methods were used to determine the beginning, maximum and end of the spring mass development of phytoplankton by estimating the inflexion points (A), fitting a Weibull-type function (B) and fitting linear segments to the logarithmic values (C). For the data set from Saidenbach Reservoir, all three methods proved to be relevant to the analysis of long-term trends. Differences between the maxima determined by the different methods seemed small, but there were deviations when the maximum was related to physical factors such as ice-out. The Weibull-type fit gave the most reliable and comprehensible results and is recommended for trend analyses. For all methods, long-term analysis of the duration of the spring mass development and the duration of the spring full circulation revealed a period of consistently low values (1975-1990) followed by a period of higher values (1990-2005). These periods were also identified for the date of ice-out, although in this case there was a period of high values followed by a period of low values. A sensitivity analysis that compared results from subsampled time series with increasing time intervals indicated that a minimum of one sample every three weeks is needed to obtain reliable results.

We measured seasonal changes in the cell sizes and densities of the diatom Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton in Lake Biwa from February 2012 to January 2017 and examined possible causal variables on sexual reproduction and cell density of F. crotonensis. Cell size tended to decrease with increase in cell density in spring and summer to autumn, though the pattern was not so clear in 2012 and 2013. The highest cell density (1.6 x 10(4) cells L-1) was recorded in May 2014, with the average cell size being 73.5 mu m; the lowest density (7.1 cells L-1) was recorded in December 2016 (average cell size 86.5 mu m), reflecting biannual cell size reduction and restoration which can be due to sexual reproduction. We used time series analysis to delineate the seasonality of cell size changes of the target diatom and Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) to explore the effects of possible causal variables on sexual reproduction and cell density of F. crotonensis and to evaluate the influences of environmental factors. We found that water temperature may influence the cell density (vegetative reproduction) of F. crotonensis, though we could not identify any possible causal variables for the algal sexual reproduction. In addition, time series decomposition analysis, together with the seasonal changes in cell size mentioned above, proved that the target diatom followed reduction in cell size twice a year.

Landscape controls on spatiotemporal discharge variability in a boreal catchment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Improving the understanding of how stream flow dynamics are influenced by landscape characteristics, such as soils, vegetation and terrain, is a central endeavor of catchment hydrology. Here we investigate how spatial variability in stream flow is related to landscape characteristics using specific discharge time series from 14 partly nested subcatchments in the Krycklan basin (0.12 - 68 km(2)). Multivariate principal component analyses combined with univariate analyses showed that while variability in landscape characteristics and specific discharge were strongly related, the spatial patterns varied with season and wetness conditions. During spring snowmelt and at the annual scale, specific discharge was positively related to the sum of wetland and lake area. During summer, when flows are lowest, specific discharge was negatively related to catchment tree volume, but positively related to deeper sediment deposits and catchment area. The results indicate how more densely forested areas on till soils become relatively drier during summer months, while wet areas and deeper sediment soils maintain a higher summer base flow. Annual and seasonal differences in specific discharge can therefore be explained to a large extent by expected variability in evapotranspiration fluxes and snow accumulation.

We present results from Lake Neuchatel (western Switzerland) that demonstrate equilibrium precipitation of calcite, except during high productivity periods, and the presence of detrital and resuspended calcite. Mineralogy, geochemistry and stable isotope values of Lake Neuchatel trap sediments and adjacent rivers suspension were studied. Mineralogy of suspended matter in the major inflowing rivers documents an important contribution of detrital carbonates, predominantly calcite with minor amounts of dolomite and ankerite. Using mineralogical data, the quantity of allochthonous calcite can be estimated by comparing the ratio ankerite + dolomite/calcite + ankerite + dolomite in the inflowing rivers and in the traps. Material taken from sediment traps shows an evolution from practically pure endogenic calcite in summer (10-20% detrital material) to higher percentages of detrital material in winter (up to 20-40%). Reflecting these mineralogical variations, delta(13)C and delta(18)O values of calcite from sediment traps are more negative in summer than in winter times. Since no significant variations in isotopic composition of lake water were detected over one year, factors controlling oxygen isotopic composition of calcite in sediment traps are the precipitation temperature, and the percentage of resuspended and detrital calcite. Samples taken close to the river inflow generally have higher delta values than the others, confirming detrital influence. SEM and isotopic studies on different size fractions (<2, 2-6, 6-20, 20-60, >60 mu m) of winter and summer samples allowed the recognition of resuspension and to separate new endogenic calcite from detrital calcite. Fractions >60 and (2 mu m have the highest percentage of detritus, Fractions 2-6 and 6-20 mu m are typical for the new endogenic calcite in summer, as given by calculations assuming isotopic equilibrium with local water. In winter such fractions show similar values than in summer, indicating resuspension. Using the isotopic composition of sediment traps material and of different size fractions, as well as the isotopic composition of lake water, the water temperature measurements and mineralogy, we re-evaluated the bulk carbonate potential for palaeoclimatic reconstruction in the presence of detrital and re-suspended calcite. This re-evaluation leads to the following conclusion: (1) the endogenic signal can be amplified by applying a particle-size separation, once the size of endogenic calcite is known from SEM study; (2) resuspended calcite does not alter the endogenic signal, but it lowers the time resolution; (3) detrital input decreases at increasing distances from the source, and it modifies the isotopic signal only when very abundant; (4) influence of detrital calcite on bulk sediment isotopic composition can be calculated.

Geochemical Evolution of a High Arsenic, Alkaline Pit-Lake in the Mother Lode Gold District, California	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												The Harvard orebody at the Jamestown gold mine, located along the Melones fault zone in the southern Mother Lode gold district, California, was milled in an open-pit operation from 1987 to 1994. Dewatering during mining produced a hydrologic cone of depression; recovery, toward the: premilling ground-water configuration produced a monomictic hit lake with alkaline Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4-type pit water, concentrations of As lip to 1,200 mu g/L, and total dissolved solids (TDS) up to 2,000 mg/L. In this study; hit-wall rocks seen; mapped and chemically analyzed to provide a contest for evaluating observed variability in the composition of the pit-lake waters ill relationship to seasonal weather patterns. All integrated hydrogeochemical model of pit-lake evolution based oil observations elf hit-lake volume, water composition (samples collected between 1995-2000, 2004), and processes occurring oil pit walls was developed ill three: stages Using the: Computer Code PHREEQC. Stage 1. takes account of seasonally variable water fluxes from precipitation, evaporation, springs, and ground water, as swell as lake stratification and mixing processes. Stage 2 adds CO2 fluxes and wall-rock interactions, allot stage 3 assesses the predictive capability of the model. Two major geologic units in fault contact comprise the pit walls. The hanging wall is composed of interlayered state, metavolcanic and metavolcaniclastic rocks, and schists; the footwall rocks are chlorite-actinolite and tale-tremolite schists generated by metasomatism of greenschist-facies mafic awl ultramafic igneous rocks. Alteration in the ore zone provides evidence for mineralizing fluids that introduced CO2, S, and K2O, and redistributed SiO2. Arsenian pyrite associated with the alteration weathers to produce goethite and jarosite oil hit walls and joints, as well as copiapite and hexahydrite efflorescences that accumulate on wall-rock faces during dry California summers. All of those pyrite: weathering products incorporate: arsenic at concentrations from < 100 up to 1,200 ppm. In the pit lake, pH and TDS reach seasonal highs in the summer epilimnion: pH is lowest ill the summer hypolimnion. Arsenic and bicarbonate covary ill the hypolimnion, rising as stratification proceeds and declining during winter rains. The computational model suggests that water fluxes alone de not account for this seasonal variability. Loss of CO2 to the atmosphere, interaction with pit walls including washoff, of efflorescent salts during the first flush and seasonal rainfall, and arsenic sorption appear to Contribute to the observed pit-lake characteristics.																			0361-0128	1554-0774				DEC	2009	104	8					1171	1211		10.2113/gsecongeo.104.8.1171	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.104.8.1171													WOS:000274499700005

The samples were collected in spring and autumn 2015-2018. The highest amounts of aluminum were recorded in the Nysa Szalona, and the lowest in the Bystrzyca. During the four-year cycle of studies, the highest values were recorded in the last year, and the lowest in the first year. The highest amounts of aluminum were found in all three rivers in the lowland tributaries. In the main rivers, higher amounts of aluminum were found at the mouth of the Nysa Szalona and Strzegomka reservoirs, while the opposite situation was found for the Bystrzyca. Higher aluminum contents were recorded in autumn than in spring, and the values of BCFW (aluminum bioaccumulation factor in relation to water) and BCFB (aluminum bioaccumulation factor in relation to bottom sediments) coefficients were also higher. The MPI (metal pollution index) was arranged in a series: Bystrzyca < Strzegomka < Nysa Szalona, while the degree of pollution was high for Bystrzyca and very high for the other two rivers. The variability in Al levels may be attributed to pollution level in the catchments, but also to successive modernization works carried out in the beds of the main rivers and their tributaries. All these works were carried out in a variable way and often covered only a fragment of the riverbed; therefore, the consequences of activity may have been visible in the catchment but not necessarily in the same vegetation cycles.

Recent changes in density, biomass, recruitment, size structure, and nutritional state of Dreissena populations in southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Trends in density, biomass, population structure, and nutritional state of Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis were examined in southern Lake Michigan between the 1990s and 2008. Density and biomass of D. polymorpha increased to a peak in the early 2000s and then declined. In contrast. D. rostriformis bugensis was first found in the southern basin in 2001 and has continued to increase in density or biomass at all depths ever since. In 2008, maximum mean density of D. rostriformis bugensis occurred at 16-30 m (19,000/m(2)), but maximum biomass (AFDW) occurred at 31-50 m (43.9 g/m(2)). D. rostriformis bugensis has only recently (since 2005) began to increase at depths >50 m. When both species were present in 2004 at depths <50 m, a condition index (Cl) for D. rostriformis bugensis was 27% higher, and shell weight per shell length was 48% lower compared to D. polymorpha. For D. rostriformis bugensis, Cl decreased in 2008 compared to 2004 at 25 m and 45 m, but biochemical content (lipid, glycogen) did not. Seasonal changes in both RNA/DNA ratio (growth) and ETS (metabolic activity) in D. rostriformis bugensis were unaffected by reproductive activity, and only ETS appeared to change seasonally relative to bottom temperatures. Spawning of D. rostriformis bugensis occurred in late summer at 25 m, but occurred in spring at 45 in. Veliger densities peaked in both spring and late summer at both depths. Future population expansion (biomass) is expected to be most rapid at depths >50 m. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Time series covering thousands of years can document the natural range of flood variability, which is critical for understanding the potential causality between changing flood patterns and climate. Here, we analyzed sediments from Lake Sandvinvatnet in southwest Norway. Detailed environmental magnetic analyses of an 830 cm-long sediment core covering the last 6,500 years captured decadal scale trends in local flood frequency. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) assessments were carried out both on split cores and individual samples to track variability in sedimentary influx; the ratios of MS measured at 77 and 293 K (MS ratios) provided information on potential changes in source regions. The results suggested that sediments from the Buerdalen valley dominate the signal in the core, and the amount of ferromagnetic (high MS) carriers increases during flood events. These carriers were assumed to be transported from slope deposits in Buerdalen during rainstorm-triggered flood events. The reconstructed flood frequency, based on sediment layers with ferromagnetic carriers, showed high variability over the past 6,500 years, and the finding was validated by overlapping with known historical floods in the area. We observed periods with a high frequency of extreme floods (4,100-3,140 cal. yr BP) compared with intervals with a few or no extreme floods (6,050-4,100 cal. yr BP). Floods in this region are commonly a result of intense rain events during fall and snow and glacial melt during late spring and summer. The systematic frequency changes during the past 6,500 years suggest a certain persistency in the processes that cause floods, where mean trends in summer temperature and precipitation may have played a role.					; Arnaud, Fabien/F-7003-2012; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020	Engeland, Kolbjorn/0000-0003-1081-8570; Arnaud, Fabien/0000-0002-8706-9902; Paasche, Oyvind/0000-0003-0329-9063; 														2296-6463				JUL 7	2020	8								239	10.3389/feart.2020.00239	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00239													WOS:000553395300001
J	Tao, YQ; Xue, B; Lei, GL; Liu, F; Wang, Z				Tao, Yuqiang; Xue, Bin; Lei, Guoliang; Liu, Fei; Wang, Zhen			Effects of climate change on bioaccumulation and biomagnification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the planktonic food web of a subtropical shallow eutrophic lake in China	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												To date effects of climate change on bioaccumulation and biomagnification of chemical pollutants in planktonic food webs have rarely been studied. Recruitments of plankton have shifted earlier due to global warming. Global warming and precipitation patterns are projected to shift seasonally. Whether and how the shifts in plankton phenology induced by climate change will impact bioaccumulation and biomagnification of chemical pollutants, and how they will respond to climate change are largely unknown. Here, we combine data analysis of the past seven decades, high temporal resolution monitoring and model development to test this hypothesis with nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the planktonic food web of a subtropical shallow eutrophic lake in China. We find biphasic correlations between both bioconcentration factors and bioaccumulation factors of the PAHs and the mean temperature, which depend on the recruitment temperatures of cyanobacteria, and copepods and cladocerans. The positive correlations between bioconcentration factors, bioaccumulation factors and the mean temperature will be observed less than approximately 13-18 days by 2050-2060 due to the shifts in plankton phenology. The PAHs and their bioaccumulation and biomagnification will respond seasonally and differently to climate change. Bioaccumulation of most of the PAHs will decrease with global warming, with higher decreasing rates appearing in winter and spring. Biomagnification of most of the PAHs from phytoplankton to zooplankton will increase with global warming, with higher increasing rates appearing in winter and spring. Our study provides novel insights into bioaccumulation and biomagnification of chemical pollutants in eutrophic waters under climate change scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we use the relationship between chrysophyte assemblages and the number of days below 4 degrees C (DB4 degrees C) in the epilimnion of a lake in northern Poland to develop a transfer function and to reconstruct winter severity in Poland for the last millennium. DB4 degrees C is a climate variable related to the length of the winter. Multivariate ordination techniques were used to study the distribution of chrysophytes from sediment traps of 37 low-land lakes distributed along a variety of environmental and climatic gradients in northern Poland. Of all the environmental variables measured, stepwise variable selection and individual Redundancy analyses (RDA) identified DB4 degrees C as the most important variable for chrysophytes, explaining a portion of variance independent of variables related to water chemistry (conductivity, chlorides, K, sulfates), which were also important. A quantitative transfer function was created to estimate DB4 C from sedimentary assemblages using partial least square regression (PLS). The twocomponent model (PLS-2) had a coefficient of determination of R-Cross(2) = 0.58, with root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP, based on leave-one-out) of 3.41 days. The resulting transfer function was applied to an annually-varved sediment core from Lake Zabifiskie, providing a new sub-decadal quantitative reconstruction of DB4 degrees C with high chronological accuracy for the period AD 1000-2010. During Medieval Times (AD 1180-1440) winters were generally shorter (warmer) except for a decade with very long and severe winters around AD 1260-1270 (following the AD 1258 volcanic eruption). The 16th and 17th centuries and the beginning of the 19th century experienced very long severe winters. Comparison with other European cold-season reconstructions and atmospheric indices for this region indicates that large parts of the winter variability (reconstructed DB4 degrees C) is due to the interplay between the oscillations of the zonal flow controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the influence of continental anticyclonic systems (Siberian High, East Atlantic/Western Russia pattern). Differences with other European records are attributed to geographic climatological differences between Poland and Western Europe (Low Countries, Alps). Striking correspondence between the combined volcanic and solar forcing and the DB4 degrees C reconstruction prior to the 20th century suggests that winter climate in Poland responds mostly to natural forced variability (volcanic and solar) and the influence of unforced variability is low.

Six chl-a retrieval models, including four Basic ERS & Envisat (A) ATSR and Meris Toolbox (BEAM) software-incorporated algorithms and MERIS three-band and two-band models, were validated to find the best fit to extract chl-a concentration in Erhai Lake. With a chl-a range of 5-15 mg m(-3), the Lakes/Eutrophic method showed the best performance. The algorithm was then applied to eight-year cloud-free MERIS images between 2003 and 2009, with seasonal and inter-annual variability analysed. Long-term chl-a distributions of Erhai Lake revealed significant seasonal and inter-annual variability. The mean chl-a of the south lake was higher in summer (14.3 mg m(-3)) than in spring (10.1 mg m(-3)), while generally lower chl-a was found in the north lake with a mean chl-a of 6.4 mg m(-3) in spring and 9.0 mg m(-3) in summer, respectively. An increasing trend was found between 2006 and 2009, and the increasing rate was 12.9% for annual chl-a of the entire lake. While chl-a seasonality was attributed to the seasonal changes of the local temperature, the inter-annual variation was possibly linked to the discharged wastewater from Dali City. This work could provide critical information for decision-makers to manage Erhai Lake's aquatic ecosystems.					; Feng, Lian/JQI-0512-2023	Feng, Lian/0000-0002-4590-3022; 													0143-1161	1366-5901					2014	35	24					8309	8322		10.1080/01431161.2014.985395	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2014.985395													WOS:000346052800013
J	KOHLER, CC; NEY, JJ				KOHLER, CC; NEY, JJ			CONSEQUENCES OF AN ALEWIFE DIE-OFF TO FISH AND ZOOPLANKTON IN A RESERVOIR	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Alewife, A. pseudoharengus, was the principal pleagic forage species in Claytor Lake, Virginia [USA], prior to a severe die-off in the winter of 1977-1978. Due to successful reproduction in 1978, abundance of adult alewives rebounded sharply in 1979. Changes in the size structure of the zooplankton community between summer 1978 (larger) and 1979 (smaller) were similar to differences reported for other waters between periods of low and high alewife abundance and are attributable to selective alewife predation. Alewife-induced shifts in zooplankton composition toward smaller forms represent a potentially significant adverse impact on cohabiting planktivores, including young-of-the-year sport fish. Alewives seldom were eaten by littoral piscivores (black basses Micropterus spp. and crappies Pomoxis spp.) but were prevalent in the diets of the pelagic species (walleye Stizostedion vitreum vitreum, white bass Morone chrysops and stripped bass M. saxatilis). When alewives were less abundant during spring and summer of 1978, pelagic predators ate more yellow perch Perca flavescens, crappies, bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and crayfish Cambarus sp. than in 1979. Growth of adult alewives and young-of-the-year walleyes and white bass was significantly greater in 1978 than in the 2 yr preceding the die-off, suggesting that both intra- and interspecific trophic competition operate when alewife density is high. Annual growth of age-2 walleyes and white bass did not differ substantially before and after the die-off; impact of the population collapse may have been mitigated by high reproductive success and rapid 1st-year growth of alewives in 1978. Alewife size-selective planktivory may have a more enduring and potentially severe impact on the reservoir fishery than does instability in the alewife population.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1981	110	3					360	369		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<360:COAADT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<360:COAADT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981LU90100006

A 9,000-year-old caribou hunting structure beneath Lake Huron	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Some of the most pivotal questions in human history necessitate the investigation of archaeological sites that are now under water. Nine thousand years ago, the Alpena-Amberley Ridge (AAR) beneath modern Lake Huron was a dry land corridor that connected northeast Michigan to southern Ontario. The newly discovered Drop 45 Drive Lane is the most complex hunting structure found to date beneath the Great Lakes. The site and its associated artifacts provide unprecedented insight into the social and seasonal organization of prehistoric caribou hunting. When combined with environmental and simulation studies, it is suggested that distinctly different seasonal strategies were used by early hunters on the AAR, with autumn hunting being carried out by small groups, and spring hunts being conducted by larger groups of cooperating hunters.

J	Yigzaw, W; Hossain, F				Yigzaw, Wondmagegn; Hossain, Faisal			Water sustainability of large cities in the United States from the perspectives of population increase, anthropogenic activities, and climate change	EARTHS FUTURE												Balancing water demand and supply with depleting sources and increasing demand needs a multi-dimensional approach given the pace at which the world is urbanizing. This study selected the contiguous United States (CONUS), 42 specific cities and their river basins to determine: Which basins and cities are more susceptible to increased water shortage? Population, water use, hydrologic model and climate model data from CMIP5 were used. Representative Concentration Pathways scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5 represented different climate change conditions. Period 1 (1950-2004) showed that more areas are affected by monthly runoff and streamflow than annual averages. In some cases, significant decreasing trends in water availability were observed during the summer (June-July-August) and spring (March-April-May) seasons. The second period (2005-2049) indicated an annual increasing trend (more water available) with higher intensity for the RCP6 scenario. Summer and spring showed areas of decreasing trend (less water available) for RCP4.5 and RCP6. Period 3 (2050-2099) exhibited a decreasing trend for the RCP2.6 (Western and Central CONUS, Great Lakes, and FL), RCP4.5 (Southwest CONUS), RCP6 (Western United States), and Central CONUS (RCP8.5). The Mississippi River has a mixed sensitivity to future climate change. The Central Valley of California, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Tucson can face further challenges as the Colorado River becomes depleted. Seawater desalination and inter-basin water transfer can be considered in future and present policies and structural developments. The West, Southeastern Coast, and FL may consider desalination, while the West and Central CONUS can use the Mississippi for inter-basin transfer.

J	De Vittor, C; Larato, C; Umani, SF				De Vittor, Cinzia; Larato, Chiara; Umani, Serena Fonda			The application of a plug-flow reactor to measure the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in seawater	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY												Most of the ambient dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is refractory to microbial degradation; bacteria can consume a minor but variable part of the DOC pool over periods of hours and days. It is important to increase our knowledge of the dynamics of the biodegradable fraction of DOC (BDOC) to understand the global carbon budget. Several methods for determining BDOC have been developed; however, the problem of most of them is the time (days/weeks) required for the colonization and/or determination. In this paper, we describe the application to seawater of a plug-flow bioreactor to measure BDOC within 3-4 h. The bioreactor was built following Sondergaard and Worm [Sondergaard. M., Worm, J., 2001. Measurement of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in lake water with a bioreactor. Water Res. 35, 2505-2513.] protocols for the measurement of BDOC in lake water. We analyzed BDOC on samples collected in the Gulf of Trieste during autumn-winter and summer 2003-2004. BDOC concentrations varied from 8 to 24 mu M and represented from 10.3% to 25.5% of the total DOC. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method, we compared bioreactor BDOC measurement with data obtained from batch cultures. The results indicate that BDOC in coastal seawater can be measured rapidly and reliably with this bioreactor. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling calcification periods of Cytheridella ilosvayi from Florida based on isotopic signatures and hydrological data	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The isotopic signatures of ostracod shells are the result of the temperature and composition of their host water and the phenology and ecology of the target species. Investigations addressing the influence of site-specific environmental variations on the isotopic ranges of ostracod shells are still rare but can provide important information on habitat-dependent variations and may signify a seasonally restricted timing of calcification periods. Here we present isotopic signatures (delta O-18(ostr), delta C-13(ostr)) of living Cytheridella ilosvayi (Ostracoda) and physical, chemical, and isotopic (delta D, delta O-18(water), delta C-13(DIC)) compositions of 14 freshwater habitats (rivers, lakes, canals, marshes, sinkholes) in South Florida from winter 2013 and summer 2014. We also present instrumental data of river temperatures and delta O-18 of precipitation (delta O-18(prec)) from this region. The physicochemical and isotopic compositions of the selected sites characterize the different habitats and show the influence of the source water, biological activity, and duration of exposure to the surface. Mean delta O-18(ostr) and delta C-13(ostr) signatures of C. ilosvayi shells correlate well with the isotopic composition of their host waters. Within-sample variabilities in repeated isotopic measurements of single ostracod shells reflect habitat-dependent ranges. The similarly high range of ostracod delta O-18 in rivers and one marsh sample indicates that both temperature and delta O-18(prec) are responsible for their variation in the whole study area. Rivers and canals, which are predominantly influenced by the input and mixing of inorganic carbon from the catchment, show smaller delta C-13(ostr) ranges than the marsh dominated by local fluctuations in biological activities. Based on these observations, background data of water temperatures and delta O-18(prec) were used to calculate monthly delta O-18 variations in a theoretical calcite formed in rivers in Florida assuming a direct reaction on precipitation changes. The calculated values showed a high variation coupled with low mean values during the summer wet season, while during the winter dry season the variation remains small and mean values increased. Inferred configurations were used to approximate possible calcification periods of C. ilosvayi. For a plausible calcification period, mean values and ranges of delta O-18(ostr) had to be equal to the theoretical calcite with a slight positive offset (vital effect). The applied model suggests a seasonal calcification period of C. ilosvayi in early spring that is probably coupled to the hydrologic cycle of Florida.

However, in recent years, anthropogenic impacts such as climate change and pollution have increased, affecting this type of ecosystem. Zooplancton communities are fundamental for regulating the biological balance in these environments, so it is essential to understand the processes that affect their dynamics. This study investigated the seasonal and spatial variation in species abundance of the zooplancton community of the Zahara- El Gastor Reservoir, Cadiz, Spain. This reservoir is located in the Guadalete-Barbate River basin and is included in the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Parc, the area with the highest rainfall in the Iberian Peninsula. Water and zooplancton samples were collected monthly over a year at four sampling sites located along the reservoir's long-axis to determine its physicochemical characteristics and zooplancton species composition. The reservoir presented a mesotrophic state and a monomictic thermal cycle, with the mixing period occurring in winter. Temperature, water depth and volume, phosphates, carbonates, pH, and conductivity were the main environmental variables that affected the seasonal and spatial patterns of the zooplancton community. Rotifers presented the highest number of species and were predominant at the tail of the reservoir, especially in autumn, where Polyarthra spp. reached high densities. Relatively low densities of copepods were found throughout the year. Small branchiopods and cyclopoids were predominant in summer, while Daphnia longispina was linced to the colder seasons. The zooplancton community of the Zahara-El Gastor Reservoir reflected changes in the trophic state of the reservoir both in space and time.

Herbivory and growth of epiphytes on macrophytes were the main factors triggering the switch. Selective herbivory by coots (Fulica atra) and rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) caused a change in macrophyte species composition from a dominance of Elodea nuttallii in 1988/1989 to Ceratophyllum demersum in 1990/1991, and finally to Potamogeton berchtholdii in 1992/1993/1994. Observations revealed a general lack of epiphytes associated with Elodea and Ceratophyllum, while Potamogeton showed a progressive coverage with epiphytes, causing Potamogeton to decline markedly during late summer. Phytoplankton blooms, dominated by cyanobacteria, appeared again during three consecutive autumns, 1992, 1993 and 1994, with chlorophyll-a concentrations reaching 60-240 mu g l(-1).

Located on the northwestern border of the Inle lake basin, the Khaung Daing hot spring outflows at a temperature of about 70 degrees C. This contribution represents a reconnaissance study of the spring and describes its main hydrochemical and isotopic features, compared to surface and ground waters in the watershed. The water pH is slightly acidic, and, compared to the other water samples from the watershed, shows an EC in the high range (57-1284 mu S/cm), the lowest pH and Eh values, and is Na-HCO3, whereas surface and ground waters are Ca(Mg)-HCO3 type. The hot spring isotopic composition falls close to the Yangon Meteoric Water Line, indicating that, despite its temperature, it is not strongly modified by water-rock interaction processes. Preliminary results suggest that this hydrothermal water is likely related to deep meteoric and ground water circulation within a fault zone, in a region characterized by an elevated geothermal gradient.

Creation of artificial upwelling areas for brown trout, Salmo trutta, spawning in still water bodies	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Brown trout, Salmo trutta L., spawning sites were constructed by creating areas of artificial upwelling water, 252 +/- 37 mL m(-2) min(-1) (95% CL), through appropriately sized spawning gravel substrate in 3 m(2) vessels buried in the bottom of a 150-m(2) pond. Natural spawning occurred in the vessels during autumn 2001-2004, with hatching and alevin swim up the following spring. In areas of upwelling, egg survival was 85-95%, while no live eggs were observed in areas without upwelling. In areas with upwelling, the maximum density of live eggs at the eyed stage was 570-1510 eggs m(-2). In spring 2004 and 2005, the density of alevins was estimated at 322 (+/- 187) m(-2) and 567 (+/- 217) m(-2), respectively, in areas with upwelling water, compared with 35.2 +/- 25.4 m(-2) in areas without upwelling water in 2004.																			0969-997X					OCT	2006	13	5					293	298		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00505.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00505.x													WOS:000240149300003
J	DIERBERG, FE; CARRIKER, NE				DIERBERG, FE; CARRIKER, NE			FIELD TESTING 2 INSTRUMENTS FOR REMOTELY SENSING WATER-QUALITY IN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Two airborne remote sensing systems, the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and the Airborne Multispectral Measurement System (AMMS), were field tested over reservoirs in the Tennessee River Valley during the summer of 1991 and the winter (AMMS only) of 1992. Univariate, linear regression analyses using ratioed wavelength bands and line height algorithms for radiance (CASI) or reflectance (AMMS) in the 625-725-nm wavelength range provided the best correlations to ground-truthed uncorrected chlorophyll a (R2 = 0.84-0.95) for both imaging systems during the summer when phytoplankton dominated the suspended solids composition. For the winter flight, using the AMMS system 3-4 days after a major rain event, reflectance in the 690-710-nm range was correlated to turbidity and suspended solids concentrations (R2 = 0.79-0.85). The high correlations between imaged data and chlorophyll in July-August and inorganic turbidity in February-March demonstrate the feasibility of using low-cost imaging spectrometers and multispectral video cameras from fixed-wing aircraft. Since these imaging systems are effective for a wide variety of waters, they should be used more frequently for monitoring, modeling, and management of large water bodies.																			0013-936X					JAN	1994	28	1					16	25		10.1021/es00050a004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00050a004								22175828					WOS:A1994MP60400013

Sistan has the highest population density in eastern Iran. This population is distributed in more than 1000 cities, villages and nomadic settlements. Sistan plain is extensively exposed to vigorous winds. 120-days wind is the most significant wind in the region which starts every year at the end of the spring and lasts all through the beginning of autumn, with a mean velocity of 100 km/h. This research utilizes a survey/descriptive method coupled with medical documents to rank the risk of destructive wind sediment dispersion in different regions of Sistan alongside the frequency of citizen's reference to medical centers due to respiratory problems or eye damages caused by these sediments during the summer of 2017. Wind sediment distribution in the environment, threatens the health of citizens. Human ecosystems in the Sistan region show a different ranking of the risks of dust on the health of the respiratory system and the eyes of citizens exposed to these materials. The citizens of these areas traditionally protect the health of their eyes and their breathing apparatus when dispersing wind deposits, using shawl cloths and his hand.

We investigated which factors suppressed blooms of M. aeruginosa in Lake Kasumigaura, a shallow hypereutrophic lake in the temperate zone of Japan, from 1999 to 2007 by quantifying the 16S rRNA gene of M. aeruginosa using real-time PCR. These results showed that M. aeruginosa existed in the lake water throughout the year. The abundance of M. aeruginosa usually increased from March to July and decreased from August to February. The factors determining the maximum density of the year were the overwintering population and the growth rate in summer (in June and July). The overwintering population was affected by abundance during the previous summer. The growth rates of M. aeruginosa in summer were correlated significantly with the extinction coefficient and mean daily photosynthetically active radiation irradiance. The mean daily irradiance in summer from 1999 to 2007 was 77% of that from 1983 to 1986, when blooms of M. aeruginosa occurred. Therefore, the most important factor controlling the growth of M. aeruginosa in Lake Kasumigaura after 1999 appears to be the amount of light supplied to the water column.

However, there are currently significant discrepancies among climatic simulation results, sedimentary and synthesized Holocene temperature records. These discrepancies call for new Holocene temperature records with a robust chronology and unambiguous indicative significance. Here, we present a ca. 45-year-resolution alpine peat alpha-cellulose carbon isotopic (delta C-13) record from the Altai Mountains in central Asia. The chronology of the record has been well-constrained by 22 AMS C-14 dates of the peat alpha-cellulose samples. Based on detailed modern-process study results, the indicative significance of the record has been carefully determined as summer temperature indicator. The record reveals an overall trend of increasing summer temperature for the past ca. 11 ka with a warmer early (from ca. 8-6 ka BP) and late (from ca. 4-0 ka BP) Holocene and colder middle Holocene (from ca. 6-4 ka BP). The general pattern of a warmer early and late Holocene and colder middle Holocene is consistent with previously reported temperature records from central Asia, the Tibetan Plateau, and North China. The long-term warming trend in our summer temperature record is consistent with recently reported winter temperature records from high latitudes of continental Eurasia. All these results further support the reliability of our summer temperature record from central Asia. The better understandings about the Holocene temperature history and its possible driven mechanism(s) can be benefited potentially from more reliable Holocene temperature records, including our record reported in this paper.

J	Buccola, NL; Risley, JC; Rounds, SA				Buccola, Norman L.; Risley, John C.; Rounds, Stewart A.			Simulating future water temperatures in the North Santiam River, Oregon	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A previously calibrated two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water-quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) of Detroit Lake in western Oregon was used in conjunction with inflows derived from Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) hydrologic models to examine in-lake and downstream water temperature effects under future climate conditions. Current and hypothetical operations and structures at Detroit Dam were imposed on boundary conditions derived from downscaled General Circulation Models in base (1990-1999) and future (2059-2068) periods. Compared with the base period, future air temperatures were about 2 degrees C warmer year-round. Higher air temperature and lower precipitation under the future period resulted in a 23% reduction in mean annual PRMS-simulated discharge and a 1 degrees C increase in mean annual estimated stream temperatures flowing into the lake compared to the base period. Simulations incorporating current operational rules and minimum release rates at Detroit Dam to support downstream habitat, irrigation, and water supply during key times of year resulted in lower future lake levels. That scenario results in a lake level that is above the dam's spillway crest only about half as many days in the future compared to historical frequencies. Managing temperature downstream of Detroit Dam depends on the ability to blend warmer water from the lake's surface with cooler water from deep in the lake, and the spillway is an important release point near the lake's surface. Annual average in-lake and release temperatures from Detroit Lake warmed 1.1 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C from base to future periods under present-day dam operational rules and fill schedules. Simulated dam operations such as beginning refill of the lake 30 days earlier or reducing minimum release rates (to keep more water in the lake to retain the use of the spillway) mitigated future warming to 0.4 and 0.9 degrees C below existing operational scenarios during the critical autumn spawning period for endangered salmonids. A hypothetical floating surface withdrawal at Detroit Dam improved temperature control in summer and autumn (0.6 degrees C warmer in summer, 0.6 degrees C cooler in autumn compared to existing structures) without altering release rates or lake level management rules.

Phytoplankton periodicity was followed from December 1975 to January 1980 as part of a study investigating possible changes in these lakes as a consequence of hydroelectric development. The phytoplankton was highly dominated by diatoms, e.g., Diatoma elongatum, Cyclotella stelligera, Asterionella formosa, and Synedra acus, but in lakes Ohau and Benmore populations of green algae occasionally developed. In all four lakes seasonal phytoplankton periodicity was observed with maximum biomass in spring and summer. In Lake Tekapo, the first lake in the chain, maximum biomass did not exceed 300 mg m-3, but in the very turbid Lake Pukaki the maximum summer biomass ranged between 300 and 800 mg m-3. In Lake Ohau, the least turbid lake, maximum biomass was around 1,000 mg m-3. In the newly created Lake Benmore periodicity was less evident and summer maxima reached over 1,500 mg m-3. The phytoplankton periodicity in these lakes is greatly influenced by seasonal patterns of turbidity from inflowing glacial silt.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 5	1986	138						221	236		10.1007/BF00027242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027242													WOS:A1986E070900016

W.; Brikowski, Tom			Geochemistry of a large impoundment - Part II: Fe and Mn cycling and metal transport	GEOCHEMISTRY-EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS												Depletion of oxygen in lakes and reservoirs due to summer stratification has significant effects on many aspects of water chemistry, including lake productivity, elemental cycling and water quality. We have studied the redox conditions of Lake Texoma, a large impoundment lake on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, USA, formed from the confluence of the Red and Washita rivers, in order to understand the impact of summer anoxia on metal distribution. In summer, dissolved oxygen decreases with depth (from c. 7.0 to 0.1 mg/L), whereas dissolved (<0.45 mu m) Fe (and Fe2+), Mn and HS- concentrations show complementary increases in the hypolimnion. Summer anoxia is, to a large degree, responsible for vertical variations in Fe and Mn concentrations, and Fe speciation is controlled by Fe-oxyhydroxide reduction and subsequent pyrite precipitation in sulphide-rich bottom waters. Summer anoxia is also responsible for vertical variations in the concentration of other metals including Ba, Pb and Ni in the deepest portion (main lake) of the lake. Lake Texoma and its two river arms show relatively minor variation in delta S-34(CDT) (from +11.5 to +13.4%), mirroring variation in Permian/Cretaceous marine gypsum and anhydrite deposits (delta S-34(CDT) +10 to +15%) in the headwater regions of the catchment. Increasing delta S-34(CDT) with depth (>16 m) in the main lake is consistent with fractionation associated with sulphate reduction in anoxic bottom waters. delta C-13(PDB) values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) become more negative (from -2.5 to -8.2 %) with depth in summer, due to bacterial oxidation of organic matter linked to sulphate reduction. Summer anoxia may induce temporal degradation of water quality in the central three zones of the lake with elevated Fe and Mn concentrations owing to breakdown of oxyhydroxides and release of adsorbed heavy metals, such as Pb and Ni. However, complete turnover of the water column in the autumn lowers dissolved Fe, Mn and heavy metal concentrations by oxidation and formation of oxyhydroxides. The characterization of anoxia in Lake Texoma provides the background for further water quality research and management for the rapidly increasing population of North Texas and improves our understanding of redox cycling and metal mobility in reservoirs.					; Leybourne, Matthew/AAA-9340-2019; Sun, Li/NZN-6716-2025	Leybourne, Matthew/0000-0002-2361-6014; 													1467-7873	2041-4943				MAY	2016	16	2					165	177		10.1144/geochem2015-361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/geochem2015-361													WOS:000378137100006

North Carolina. The objective of this study was to make inferences about current forage sufficiency for striped bass from length at age of capture and body condition of striped bass collected since 1994. Fish were obtained from November-January fishing tournaments and gillnet sets in 1994-1998. Late season samples were designed to collect fish after they had several months to recover From any reduced condition caused by summer temperature and dissolved oxygen related habitat stress. Striped bass were also collected with gill nets in late June or early July 1996-1998 to gather pre-summer habitat stress body condition information. Growth for fish older than age 2 had declined from pre-study data collected by Duke Power Company. Relative weight (Wr) indices for striped bass were poor (means similar to 80%) in all years for both winter and the June samples. Poor growth and condition. especially in the absence of summer habitat stress, suggest that forage is insufficient for the current number of striped bass in Lake Norman.																									1999							193	199																WOS:000169733700022
J	BARBOSA, FAR; TUNDISI, JG				BARBOSA, FAR; TUNDISI, JG			PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A SHALLOW QUATERNARY LAKE AT EASTERN BRASIL	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The primary production of the phytoplankton of Lake Carioca (19.degree.10''S and 42.degree.1''W) was measured at 2 sampling stations in July 1977 and Jan. 1978 by the in situ 14C technique. Data include: solar radiation, wind speed, water chemistry and thermal structure of the water column. The standing stock of phytoplankton was measured by the chlorophyll a concentration. Higher levels of primary production occurred in winter and diurnal cycles of certain environmental factors such as temperature (mainly during the winter) are suggested. At the period of strong stratification a deoxygenated layer is marked off by the thermal discontinuity. The vertical profiles of photosynthesis exhibit light inhibition at surface. Values for primary production ranged from 0.32 mgC/m3 day to 108.8 mgC/m3 day. Dark fixation values were high mainly in the summer and ranged from undetectable values to up to 90%. Very low photosynthetic efficiencies were recorded. Factors which control the seasonal variation were related mainly to nutrient supply rather than light and temperature. The absence of thermocline in the winter is probably the cause of higher levels of production at this season, due to nutrient enrichment of the euphotic zone by mixing.

Hence, our research objective was to compare multiple water quality sampling strategies for Prairie watersheds and rank them based on operational and statistical criteria. The focus was on the Catfish Creek Watershed (Manitoba, Canada), which drains into the hypereutrophic Lake Winnipeg. Water samples were collected every 7 h during the 2013 open-water season and notably analyzed for nitrate and orthophosphate. The original high-frequency dataset (7 h) was then deconstructed into lowerfrequency datasets to mimic strategies involving sample collection on a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and seasonal basis. A comparison and decision matrix was also built to assess the ability of the lower-frequency datasets to retain the statistical properties of the original (7 h) dataset. Results indicate that nutrient concentrations vary significantly over short timescales and are affected by both sampling time (day versus night) and water level fluctuations. The decision matrix revealed that seasonal sampling is sufficient when the goal is only to capture mean water quality conditions; however, subdaily to daily sampling is required for accurate process signal representation. While we acknowledge that sampling programs designed by researchers and public agencies are often driven by different goals, we found daily sampling to be the most parsimonious strategy for the study watershed and suggest that it would help to better quantify nutrient loads to Lake Winnipeg.					; Ali, Genevieve/E-3162-2013	Ali, Genevieve/0000-0001-5144-8188; Ross, Cody/0000-0002-4095-7566													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2015	187	7							395	10.1007/s10661-015-4637-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4637-9								26038319					WOS:000357340500003

However, few empirical studies of population-level impacts have been conducted. New York State historically protected nesting bass with a closed season. In 1994, a special spring bass season was opened in the New York waters of Lake Erie, and in 2007, a spring catch-and-immediate-release season was opened in most of New York's remaining waters. Long-term monitoring programs were in place on two inland lakes and New York's portion of Lake Erie prior to the regulation changes, facilitating assessment of impacts of liberalizing regulations on year-class production. In Canadarago Lake (surface area 770 ha), fall electrofishing surveys sampled both young-of-year Largemouth Bass M. salmoides and Smallmouth Bass M dolomieu. Mean catch per hour of Largemouth Bass during the 6 years prior to the spring season was 15.6, compared to 27.8/h over the postchange years (p = 0.63). For Smallmouth Bass in Canadargo Lake, prechange catch rates averaged 1.2/h, with a rate of 0.6/h after the change (p = 0.32). In Oneida Lake (surface area 20,670 ha), trawl surveys provided an index of young-of-year Smallmouth Bass. Average catch-per-haul during the 6 years prior to the regulation change was 0.4 compared to 1.8/haul during the following 6 years (p = 0.04). Gill-net surveys of age-2 Smallmouth Bass in Lake Erie produced a year-class index of 3.0/net over 15 years prior to opening of a spring bass fishery and a catch of 6.0/net over the following 17 years (p = 0.04). In three of four cases, year-class production increased following the opening of spring angling for bass, and increases were statistically significant for Smallmouth Bass in Oneida Lake and Lake Erie. Our results provide no evidence that spring fishing for black bass in large lake systems results in negative population level impacts on bass recruitment.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-40-0				2015	82						181	191																WOS:000352823400018

Artificial dam lakes as suitable habitats for exotic invertebrates: Ostracoda ecology and distribution in reservoirs of the Eastern Iberian Peninsula	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Reservoirs are the most common deep lakes in Spain, as a consequence of water needs and dry climate. Although these aquatic systems can play an important ecological role in such an area with few large natural lakes, they can also provide new habitats for exotic species, which can colonize ecosystems that native species have not explored yet. Here we present our results for a biannual survey of the ostracod fauna from 24 reservoirs in Xuquer River basin. We check which variables affect ostracod presence, test for differences between winter and summer assemblages, and compare our data with previous available ostracod records from the same river drainage network. Our results reveal that ostracod presence is positively related to high diversity of the invertebrate community and reservoir volume, and negatively with phosphorus concentration. Among the 22 species found, it is noteworthy the first Iberian record of llyocypris getica and the second European record of Candonocypris novaezelandiae. Ostracod assemblages significantly vary between summer and winter, and strong differences are found between ostracod communities of reservoirs and those from their connected rivers. Remarkably higher frequency of exotic species in the reservoirs confirms previous findings about the facilitation that artificial ecosystems confer to aquatic invasions.

Phytoplankton was mainly composed of diatoms, cryptophytes and chrysophytes. The diatoms Aulacoseira and Rhizosolenia were always uniformly distributed with depth, initially probably due to mixing induced by heat flux from the sediment and later due to thermal convection. Motile Rhodomonas cryptophytes and Chrysococcus chrysophytes were most abundant near the ice showing that, despite their small size, they were partly able to resist mixing by convection. Their ability to stay in more illuminated water layers was reflected in net rates of increase about an order of magnitude higher than those of diatoms in the middle of the lake. Given the low temperatures and convection, the observed net rates of increase of motile taxa were very high compared to growth rates reported in the literature. The gradual increase in light availability following melting of ice led to a consistent increase in the abundances of major phytoplankton taxa irrespective of deep convective circulation. It is suggested that those algae most abundant at the time of ice break have a competitive advantage in the following open water conditions when nutrients are abundant but deep water circulation limits light availability. The results emphasize that in lakes which cool below the maximum density of water before freezing, apparently small differences in temperature and light conditions can cause important changes in the circulation patterns that impact on phytoplankton development.

Soil samples were collected from three sites (Tamarix ramosissima, Halocnemum strobilaceum, and Phragmites australis) and different soil layers (0-5, 5-15,15-25, and 25-35 cm) within this wetland during spring, summer and autumn, and the diversity of cultured/uncultured Azotobacter based on the 16S rDNA and nifH genes was characterized. Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and bivariate correlation analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between the diversity of uncultured Azotobacter and soil environmental factors. A total of 17 cultured Azotobacter strains were isolated, five of which had stronger nitrogen-fixation ability (more than 10 mg/mL). Meanwhile, most of the cultured Azotobacter strain sequences were grouped into Bacillus sphaericus and Bacillus subtilis, and fewer sequences were affiliated with Actinomycetes. Furthermore, PCR-DGGE indicated that the diversity of uncultured Azotobacter was not balanced in some samples and the Shannon diversity index varied from 0.685 to 2.626. The uncultured Azotobacter were grouped into autotrophic genera Azotobacter and Rhizobium. Finally, bivariate correlation analysis showed that the diversity of uncultured Azotobacter was significantly correlated with soil organic carbon, inorganic carbon, NH4+-N, NO3--N and microbial biomass N in the Ebinur Lake wetland in Xinjiang.

Spatial variability of methane (CH4) ebullition in a tropical hypereutrophic reservoir: silted areas as a bubble hot spot. Lake Reserv Manage. 35:105114.The concentration of methane (CH4) has doubled in the atmosphere over the last 200 yr, raising the need to understand emissions of this potent greenhouse gas from inland waters. CH4 ebullition is the dominant pathway in shallow aquatic environments and is difficult to quantify due to its episodic nature and heterogeneous spatial distribution. We investigated the temporal and spatial variability of CH4 ebullition during 2013 in a shallow hypereutrophic urban reservoir, in Belo Horizonte City, Brazil. The average emission measured during summer was 780 mg CH4/m(2)/d, ranging from 1 to 3070 (n = 75). During winter, the average emission was 316 mg CH4/m(2)/d, ranging from 4 to 1253 (n = 75). A strong spatial variation (P < 0.001) was observed across the reservoir in both seasons. Several folds higher (3958% of the total) emissions were recorded at the mouth of the main tributaries, which therefore was considered to be a hot spot ebullition zone. This was expected due to its shallow area (mean depth 1.30 m) with low hydrostatic pressure and 2 to 6 C (winter and summer, respectively) higher sediment temperatures, which is aggravated by the intense siltation process resulting from insufficient management of the sewage water entering the reservoir. In this article we demonstrate the consequence of siltation as an enhancing factor for CH4 emission from the hot spots ebullition zones.

How reservoirs alter drinking water quality: Organic matter sources, sinks, and transformations	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Kraus TEC, Bergamaschi BA, Hernes PJ, Doctor D, Kendall C, Downing BD, Losee RF. 2011. How reservoirs alter drinking water quality: Organic matter sources, sinks, and transformations. Lake Reserv Manage. 27: 205-219. Within reservoirs, production, transformation, and loss of dissolved organic matter (DOM) occur simultaneously. While the balance between production and loss determines whether a reservoir is a net sink or source of DOM, changes in chemical composition are also important because they affect DOM reactivity with respect to disinfection by-product (DBP) formation. The composition of the DOM pool also provides insight into DOM sources and processing, which can inform reservoir management. We examined the concentration and composition of DOM in San Luis Reservoir, a large off-stream impoundment of the California State Water Project. We used a wide array of DOM chemical tracers including dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, trihalomethane and haloacetic acid formation potentials (THMFP and HAAFP, respectively), absorbance properties, isotopic composition, lignin phenol content, and structural groupings determined by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). There were periods when the reservoir was a net source of DOC due to the predominance of algal production (summer), a net sink due to the predominance of degradation (fall-winter), and balanced between production and consumption (spring). Despite only moderate variation in bulk DOC concentration (3.0-3.6 mg C/L), changes in DOM composition indicated that terrestrial-derived material entering the reservoir was being degraded and replaced by aquatic-derived DOM produced within the reservoir. Substantial changes in the propensity of the DOM pool to form THMs and HAAs illustrate that the DBP precursor pool was not directly coupled to bulk DOC concentration and indicate that algal production is an important source of DBP precursors. Results suggest reservoirs have the potential to attenuate DOM amount and reactivity with respect to DBP precursors via degradative processes; however, these benefits can be decreased or even negated by the production of algal-derived DOM.

The unusual weather began on Christmas Eve, 1861, and persisted for some 45 days as a series of middle-latitude cyclones made landfall along the California coast. Episodes of very cold and very warm temperatures occurred both during the storm and in the spring of 1862 as meridional flow prevailed. Heavy precipitation swelled the Santa Ana River to more than triple the highest estimated discharge in this century. High water levels in coastal streams between Los Angeles and San Diego persisted into the spring. Lakes were created in the Los Angeles Basin and the Mojave Desert. Arroyos were cut.

The nutrient status of the study lakes varied from transitional mesotrophic/eutrophic to hypereutrophic. Glyptotendipes paripes larvae were the most common in Lake Wauburg, while Cladotanytarsus spp. were numerically the most abundant in Lakes Dora and Yale. Mean density of G. paripes in Lake Dora declined sharply during the study period to very low levels and remained low through the remainder of the investigation. Glyptotendipes paripes densities in Lake Wauburg remained high during the entire study period. Populations of G, paripes in Lake Yale generally peaked during summer and fall and decreased considerably during the winter. Estimated G. paripes annual productivity ranged widely from 0.2 g/m(2) (Lake Dora) to 156.9 g/m(2) (Lake Wauburg). Canonical correspondence analyses indicated that the primary influences on distributions of chironomid larvae in the study lakes were water depth, dry weight of sediment, and the presence of sand, muck or vegetation. Although G. paripes larval distributions tended to be associated with shallower, sand), substrates in Lakes Dora and Wauburg, those larvae were distributed over or in the muck bottom areas of Lake Yale.

J	Beltaos, S				Beltaos, Spyros			Hydro-climatic impacts on the ice cover of the lower Peace River	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Since the late 1960s, a paucity of ice-jam flooding in the lower Peace River has resulted in prolonged dry periods and considerable reduction in the area covered by lakes and ponds that provide habitat for aquatic life in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) region. Though major ice jams occur at breakup, antecedent conditions play a significant role in their frequency and severity. These conditions are partly defined by the mode of freezeup and the maximum thickness that is attained during the winter, shortly before the onset of spring and development of positive net heat fluxes to the ice cover. Data from hydrometric gauge records and from field surveys tire utilized herein to Study these conditions. It is shown that freezeup flows are considerably larger at the present time than before repulation, and may be responsible tor more frequent formation of Porous accumulation covers. Despite a concomitant rise in winter temperatures, solid-ice thickness has increased since the 1960s. Using a simple ice growth model, specifically developed for the Study area, it is shown that, porous accumulation covers enhance winter ice growth via accelerated freezing into the porous accumulation. Coupled with a reduction in winter snowfall, this effect can not only negate, but reverse, the effect of warmer winters on ice thickness, thus explaining present conditions. The present model is also shown to be a useful prediction tool, especially for extrapolating incomplete data to the end of the winter. Copyright (C) 2007 Crown in the right of Canada.

Glen			A Portable Freshwater Closed-System Fish Egg Incubation System	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												To identify fish eggs collected in the field to species, a portable closed-system fish egg incubation system was designed and used to incubate and hatch the eggs in the laboratory. The system is portable, small in scale (2.54 x 1.52 x 2.03 m), and affordable, with the approximate cost of the system being US$8,300 (2012). The main tank is 678 L and holds a battery of up to 21 (egg) incubation jars. The system includes three independent water pumping systems to (1) provide aerated water to hatching jars, (2) filter and sterilize incubation water, and (3) provide temperature-controlled water in the main tank bath and the incubation jars. The system was successfully used to incubate freshwater fish eggs to raise resulting larvae to the post-yolk-sac stage for three seasons (spring 2012, spring 2013, and fall 2013) over two consecutive years, at two different locations, enabling us to identify fish eggs to species by providing identifiable fish larvae from incubated fish eggs.

Climate variability promotes unprecedented cyanobacterial blooms in a remote, oligotrophic Ontario lake: evidence from paleolimnology	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Dickson Lake, located in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, is a remote, oligotrophic lake, where cyanobacterial blooms of the genus Dolichospermum (Ralfs ex Bornet & Flahault) P. Wacklin, L. Hoffmann and J. Komarek were reported for the first time in the fall of 2014, and subsequently in the late spring of 2015. To investigate the potential environmental triggers of these bloom events, we assessed long-term trends in water quality using a multi-proxy paleolimnological approach, examining sedimentary diatoms, chironomids, cladocerans, spectrally inferred chlorophyll a, and cyanobacterial akinetes preserved in a Pb-210-dated sediment core. Assemblage changes were modest in all biological proxies. A subtle increase in the abundance of warm-water chironomid taxa (T-opt>15 degrees C) commences in the year similar to 2000, with further increases in the most recent years of the sediment record (similar to 2013-2015). End-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations (CI-VWHO), inferred from chironomid remains, reveal a decline in oxygen concentrations over the last two decades coincident with the highest levels of sedimentary chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial akinetes in the sediment record. These paleolimnological findings corroborate observed reports of the onset of cyanobacterial blooms in Dickson Lake in late 2014 and are consistent with increasingly favourable bloom-forming conditions over the past few decades that are related to warmer air temperatures, sharp declines in wind speed, and a lengthening of the ice-free season by 2weeks since 1975. It is plausible that late ice-out and a quick onset to stratification in 2014 may have resulted in incomplete spring mixing, early onset of hypolimnetic anoxia, and increased internal nutrient loading, that, occurring during a period when climate conditions were particularly ideal for cyanobacterial proliferation, may have fueled the unprecedented algal blooms in this remote lake. Collectively, the factors causing algal blooms in remote lakes such as Dickson Lake are not yet fully understood, and it is worrisome that with continued warming the triggering conditions may become a more common feature of Algonquin Park and other minimally impacted Boreal Shield lakes in the coming years.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Favot, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3860-8658; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2019	62	1					31	52		10.1007/s10933-019-00074-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-019-00074-4													WOS:000467649300003

Phosphorus (P) is a crucial element during this shift and is usually concentrated in the suspended particulate matter (SPM) in water. However, the dominant processes controlling internal P release in the algae- (ADA) and macrophyte-dominated (MDA) areas under the influence of P-concentrated SPM remains unclear. In this study, we conducted monthly field observations of P exchange across the sediment-water interface (SWI) with the deposition of SPM in the ADA and MDA of Lake Taihu. Results revealed that both algae- and macrophyte-originated SPM led to the depletion of oxygen across the SWI during summer and autumn. Redox-sensitive P (Fe-P) and organic P (Org-P) were the dominant mobile P fractions in both areas. High fluxes of P across the SWI were observed in both areas during the summer and autumn. However, the processes controlling P release were quite different. In MDA, P release was mostly controlled by a traditional Fe-P dissolution process influenced by the coupled cycling of iron, sulfur, and P. In the ADA, Org-P control was intensified with the deterioration of algal bloom status, accompanied with the dissolution of Fe-P. Evidence from the current study revealed that the dominant process controlling the internal P release might gradually shift from Fe-P to a coupled process of Fe-P and Org-P with the shift of the macrophyte- to an algae-dominated state in shallow eutrophic lakes. The differentiated processes in the MDA and ADA should be given more attention during future research and management of internal P loadings in eutrophic lakes.

These areas are highly susceptible to nutrient loss, which affects the water quality of rivers and lakes. Therefore, it is very important to understand current landscape pattern and processes controlling water quality, not only identifying factors affecting it, but also identifying strategies and restoring areas for mitigation. We studied linkage of 21 years (1990-2011) of water quality (WQ) data from 16 agricultural watersheds, using landscape indices at three functional scales: watershed-wide, saturation-excess zone, and riparian zone (of varying widths). The hydro-biogeochemical functional areas of watershed were obtained by digital terrain analysis. Statistical analyses by generalized linear model and multivariate redundancy analysis indicated that the fraction of watershed in agricultural use was linked to most of the studied water quality variables. The relationships varied across the seasons: they were strongest during high flow periods (spring and autumn) when also highest nutrient losses occur. Total suspended sediment concentrations were linked to critical source areas. Riparian vegetation index was important explaining nitrate concentrations in autumn. Terrain-based mapping of hydro-biogeochemical functional areas provides a rapid identification of potential sites to mitigate diffuse nutrient pollution, particularly in riparian zones.

Variation in Riverine Nitrate Flux and Fall Nitrogen Fertilizer Application in East-Central Illinois	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												In east-central Illinois, fertilizer sales during the past 20 yr suggest that approximately half of the fertilizer nitrogen (N) applied to corn (Zea mays L.) occurs in the fall; however, fall fertilizer N sales were greatly reduced in 2009 as wet soil conditions restricted fall fieldwork, including fertilizer N applications. In 2010, we observed unusually low flow-weighted nitrate concentrations (approximately 40% below the long-term average) in two east-central Illinois rivers (5.7 mg N L-1 in the Embarras River and 5.6 mg N L-1 in the Lake Fork of the Kaskaskia River). Using long-term river nitrate data sets (1993-2012 for the Embarras and 1997-2012 for the Kaskaskia), we examined nitrate concentrations and developed regression models to estimate the association between fall fertilizer N application on riverine nitrate yields in these tile-drained watersheds. During these periods of record, annual riverine nitrate yields ranged from 8 to 57 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (30 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) average) for the Embarras River and 2.6 to 59 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (32 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) average) for the Kaskaskia. Multivariate linear regression relationships with the current and previous year's annual water yields, previous year's corn yield, and nine-county fall fertilizer sales accounted for 96% of the annual variation in nitrate yield in both watersheds. Running the regression models with fall fertilizer sales set to the 2009 amount suggests that the average reduction in nitrate yield (for the period of record) would be 17 and 20% for the Embarras and Kaskaskia Rivers, respectively. These data suggest that shifting fertilizer N application to the spring can be detected in watersheds as large as 481 km(2).																			0047-2425	1537-2537				JUL-AUG	2014	43	4					1467	1474		10.2134/jeq2013.12.0499	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2013.12.0499								25603094					WOS:000339273000037

The maritime glaciers in western Norway are mainly controlled by winter precipitation. Hence, fluctuations in magnitude and equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) of these glaciers reflect variability in wintertime atmospheric circulation patterns in the northeast Atlantic region. By combining an independent proxy for summer temperature with reconstructed ELAs during the Holocene, it is possible to reconstruct former winter precipitation. We track the dominant position of the westerlies during the Holocene by comparing records of winter precipitation along a 2000 km south-north coastal transect in Norway. Analyses of modern data on the evolution of the polar vortex indicate that there is a strong relationship between polar vortex and storm-track variability over the North Atlantic. Periods with increased winter precipitation along the coast of Norway are associated with a stronger effect of the westerlies, where differences in the distribution of precipitation are assumed to reflect changes in the position of the westerlies. The largest precipitation anomalies caused by a dominant southerly position of the westerlies are found around 2.8, 1.2 and 0.4 ka yrs BP. However, a general humid phase prevailed between 2.3 and 0.9 ka yrs BP. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hence, mines have also been detected to pose problems years after closure due to the leaching of toxic drainage initiated by sulfide oxidation. To assess the effects of chronic but relatively low volume acid mine drainage derived from the Haveri copper-gold mine operating between 1938 and 1960 on a freshwater bay in southern Finland, we compared cladoceran assemblages from the pre-mining period with contemporary populations using paleolimnological approaches and multiple sediment cores. The cladoceran community of the pre-mining era differed significantly from the contemporary community of the lake (ANOSIM R = 0.91; p = 0.0001), but closely resembled the contemporary community of a nearby non-polluted reference site. Our results suggest that the differences in species compositions between pre-mining and contemporary samples are most likely caused by eutrophication and not by the AMD impact. Because AMD at our study site is most intense during the spring snowmelt period, cladocerans may avoid seasonal pollution peaks through winter dormancy. Possible pollution peaks resulting from heavy rains during the summer may have negative impacts on the cladoceran community, but such short-term impacts are probably rapidly counteracted by immigration from cleaner areas of the lake.

Home ranges for pelagic species, such as white bass Morone chrysops, are generally not well described, yet are thought to be large. We studied white bass movement using acoustic telemetry in two irrigation reservoirs of the Republican River basin in south-western Nebraska. Acoustic transmitters were implanted in fall of the previous year and tracking occurred a minimum of once per week throughout spring (mid-March to May) 2007 and 2008.

Evidence for water temperature increase in Lake George, NY: impact on growing season duration and degree days	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake George (NY) water temperature increased significantly between 1980 and 2009, leading to a longer aquatic growing season and increased degree-days. Surface water (0-10 m) temperatures increased by 0.063 and 0.051 C/yr, and degree-days increased by 229 and 195 degree-days in the North and South basins, respectively. The aquatic growing season increased by similar to 2 weeks, with extensions in both the spring and fall. The rate of warming, degree-days, and the duration of the growing season were consistently greater in the North Basin, due in part to a greater input of groundwater in the South Basin. Weather variables over the same time period changed significantly with wind speed and cloud cover decreasing, humidity and precipitation increasing, and no significant change identified for air temperature. Wind and cloud cover were correlated to the onset of the growing season and degree-days in both the North and South basins, suggesting they are influencing the lake thermal regime through reduced evaporative cooling in the fall, diminished spring mixing and increased solar radiation absorption. Warmer water temperatures have a myriad of consequences for aquatic ecosystems from increased primary production and shifting species composition to uncoupling of trophic dynamics and increased mineralization of organic carbon. While management practices are available for some of these issues, others have no management protocols, creating a foreseeable problem for lake managers in the future.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2015	31	3					241	253		10.1080/10402381.2015.1067660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2015.1067660													WOS:000361538100007

However, paleoenvironmental evidence is limited for northern Alaska for the Lateglacial-Holocene transition. For a regional paleoenvironmental reconstruction, we investigated a permafrost ice-wedge tunnel near Barrow, Alaska. The studied site was first excavated in the early 1960s and intercepts a buried ice-wedge system at 3-6 m depth below the surface. A multi-methodological approach was applied to this buried ice-wedge system and the enclosing sediments, which in their combination, give new insight into the Late Quaternary environmental and climate history. Results of geochronological, sedimentological, cryolithological, paleoecological, isotope geochemical and microbiological studies reflect different stages of mid to late Wisconsin (MW to LW), Allerod (AD), Younger Dryas (YD), Preboreal (PB), and Late Holocene paleoenvironmental evolution. The LW age of the site is indicated by AMS dates in the surrounding sediments of 21.7 kyr BP at the lateral contact of the ice-wedge system as well as 39.5 kyr BP below the ice-wedge system. It is only recently that in this region, stable isotope techniques have been employed, i.e. to characterize different types of ground ice. The stable isotope record (oxygen: delta O-18; hydrogen: delta D) of two intersecting ice wedges suggests different phases of the northern Alaskan climate history from AD to PB, with radiocarbon dates from 12.4 to 9.9 kyr BP (ranging from 14.8 to 10.6 kyr cal BP). Stable isotope geochemistry of ice wedges reveals winter temperature variations of the Lateglacial Holocene transition including a prominent YD cold period, clearly separated from the warmer AD and PB phases. YD is only weakly developed in summer temperature indicators (such as pollen) for the northern Alaska area, and by consequence, the YD cold stadial was here especially related to the winter season. This highlights that the combination of winter and summer indicators comprehensively describes the seasonality of climate-relevant processes in discrete time intervals. The stable isotope record for the Barrow buried ice-wedge system documents for the first time winter climate change at the Lateglacial Holocene transition continuously and at relatively high (likely centennial) resolution.

Abdi			Spatio-temporal variability of dust aerosols over the Sistan region in Iran based on satellite observations	NATURAL HAZARDS												Satellite remote sensing provides important observational constraints for monitoring dust life cycle and improving the understanding of its effects on local to global scales. The present work analyzes the dust aerosol patterns over the arid environment of the Sistan region in southeastern Iran, by means of multiple satellite platforms aiming to reveal the spatio-temporal distribution and trends. The dataset includes records of Aerosol Index (AI) from Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) (1978-2001) and 6-year AI records from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard Aura. Moreover, the aerosol optical depth is analyzed through 11-year records from Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard Terra (2000-2010) and from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra (2000-2007) and Aqua (2002-2011). The main focus is to determine the similarities and differences in dust variability over southwest Asia, in general, and the Sistan region, in particular. The results show a marked seasonal cycle with high aerosol loading during summer and lower in winter, while MISR, MODIS, and TOMS/OMI observations agree in both terms of monthly and seasonally mean spatial and temporal patterns. The higher aerosol concentrations during summer are interpreted as a result of the combined effect of the seasonal drying of the Hamoun lakes and the strong northerly Levar winds favoring dust erosion from the alluvial deposits in Sistan. After prolonged drought period, the dust aerosol load over the area has increased in the beginning of the 2000 s and decreased after 2004, thereby leading to an overall declining trend during the last decade. Such a trend is absent during the winter period when dust emission over the region is minimal.					; Kaskaoutis, Dimitris/ABG-1498-2020; Eriksson, Patrick/A-2998-2012; Rashki, Alireza/H-5577-2011	Rashki, Alireza/0000-0003-0213-7097; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				MAR	2014	71	1					563	585		10.1007/s11069-013-0927-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-013-0927-0													WOS:000331395900026

During 2005 there were 10 OPs, 8 OP oxons, and 6 other OP degradation products measured. The most frequently detected OPs were chlorpyrifos, malathion, and diazinon. At Bratt's Lake the highest atmospheric concentrations were observed for chlorpyrifos, with maximum concentrations observed during July and August in 2003 showing much higher concentrations than those from 2005. This was related to its usage for grasshopper control in the province. At Abbotsford, diazinon and malathion were observed in much higher atmospheric concentrations than chlorpyrifos. Concentrations reached maximum in spring for diazinon and summer for malathion. This study is the first reported study of seasonal variations of OP oxons with their parent OP. Chlorpyrifos axon concentrations during July were generally low, indicating strong local source contributions. The chlorpyrifos oxon/chlorpyrifos ratio and diazinon oxon/diazinon ratio showed a strong seasonal variation with increasing ratio from spring to summer which was attributed to increasing sunlight hours. Malathion oxon/mathion at both sites was similar and relatively constant throughout the year. The oxon/thion ratio represents a good indicator of age of source or contributions from local versus regional atmospheric sources.

Biomarker seasonality study in Lake Van, Turkey	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The endorheic Lake Van in eastern Anatolia (Turkey) is the world's largest soda lake and it is an important site in paleoclimate studies to understand past continental conditions in western Asia. In order to gain further insights into the biomarker signatures in Lake Van's sediments we have analyzed particulate material in sediment traps deployed between August 2006 and July 2007. The biomarkers used were long chain alkenones (LCAs C-37-C-39, haptophyte lipids), isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs, Archaea membrane lipids) and pigments (chlorins and fucoxanthin). The biomarker fluxes indicate a strong seasonality in export primary productivity and the phytoplankton community structure. The highest total mass and organic carbon fluxes were found in summer, coupled to strong stratification while the lowest mass fluxes occurred in winter at the time of water column mixing. With increasing temperatures in early spring, phytoplankton export productivity grew, coupled with an increase of total mass flux and organic carbon, which might be associated to enhanced nutrient input from snowmelt runoff. The percentage of C-37:4 shows some correspondence with observed seasonal changes in Lake Van's stratification structure. We also evaluated the potential applicability of molecular temperature proxies derived from Archaea and haptophyte lipids. The use of the TEX86 proxy was precluded by low GDGT abundances. Estimated LCA temperatures were consistent with temperatures in the photic zone but no seasonality changes were observed despite the wide annual temperature range measured at Lake Van.

J	FRANCE, RL				FRANCE, RL			THE LAKE HAZEN TROUGH - A LATE WINTER OASIS IN A POLAR DESERT	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												In late winter 1990, the first surface transect of wildlife was undertaken through North America's most northerly protected reserve. Located in this region on Ellesmere Island is the unique thermal oasis surrounding Lake Hazen, the largest lake within the Arctic Circle. Abundance of non-migratory wildlife was considerably greater inside the Lake Hazen Trough compared to the depauperate desert landscape existing both north or south of the oasis, and was correlated with geographic proximity to the locus of Lake Hazen itself. The Lake Hazen Trough is therefore an ecosystemic centre of organization whose vegetative productivity, although generated during the brief summer period, is still sufficient to support elevated levels of wildlife abundance throughout the entire year.																			0006-3207						1993	63	2					149	151		10.1016/0006-3207(93)90503-S	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(93)90503-S													WOS:A1993KA21900007

Occurrence of age-0 year dwarf pikeperch Sander lucioperca in late summer - an overlooked phenomenon in reservoirs	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Late summer sampling of pelagic age-0year fish communities in five Czech reservoirs and one Dutch reservoir revealed extremely small age-0year pikeperch Sander lucioperca (mean 24mm standard length, L-S, minimum 13mm L-S) alongside more normal-sized S. lucioperca that are found at the end of the first growing season (mean 50mm L-S), resulting in two clearly size-separated cohorts. Reference to such small age-0 year S. lucioperca in lakes or reservoirs at this time of year and in such large numbers are almost absent the scientific literature, and the presence of these small S. lucioperca is contradictory to the common understanding of the reproductive biology of this species. This overlooked phenomenon may have a major effect on the population dynamics of this valuable species because of size-dependent winter mortality.

Ascherson and other isoetid plant species form the dominant vegetation in the littoral zone of temperate oligotrophic lakes. They have a huge impact on sediment chemistry as they release oxygen to the sediment, thereby influencing the redox. potential and phosphate (P) availability in the sediments. The hypothesis was that the seasonal variation in P-demand of the perennial vegetation leads to seasonal fluctuations in concentrations of the P-tractions in the sediments. Therefore, particulate sediment P-fractions, plant P and nitrogen (N) concentrations, and porewater concentrations of dissolved inorganic P and inorganic N-species were studied in three oligotrophic lakes from autumn to late summer. Low concentration of dissolved inorganic P and the P-concentration of the shoots indicated that the plants were P-limited in two of the three examined lakes. The porewater concentrations of dissolved inorganic P and the 1M MgCl2 extractable inorganic P were in general low and could only sustain growth of L. uniflora for 0.1-2.1 and 27-125 days, respectively, in the three lakes. The plant P-demand must therefore be met by P originating from less mobile P-fractions in the sediment. A clear seasonal variation was seen for sediment total P and MgCl2 extractable inorganic P in all three lakes, with the highest concentrations found in winter. The plants were probably not N-limited since the porewater concentration of nitrate and ammonia were always high and the plant N-concentration was above the critical tissue concentration found in the literature.																					90-5782-154-0				2005							173	183																WOS:000231779200019

Seasonal Streamflow Forecasting for Fresh Water Reservoir Management in the Netherlands: An Assessment of Multiple Prediction Systems	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												For efficient management of the Dutch surface water reservoir Lake IJssel, (sub)seasonal forecasts of the water volumes going in and out of the reservoir are potentially of great interest. Here, streamflow forecasts were analyzed for the river Rhine at Lobith, which is partly routed through the river IJssel, the main influx into the reservoir. We analyzed seasonal forecast datasets derived from the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) European Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (E-HYPE), and Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme of Surface Exchanges over Land (HTESSEL), which differ in their underlying hydrological formulation, but are all forced by meteorological forecasts from ECMWF's fifth generation seasonal forecast system (SEAS5). We postprocessed the streamflow forecasts using quantile mapping (QM) and analyzed several forecast quality metrics. Forecast performance was assessed based on the available reforecast period, as well as on individual summer seasons. QM increased forecast skill for nearly all metrics evaluated. Averaged over the reforecast period, forecasts were skillful for up to 4 months in spring and early summer. Later in summer the skillful period deteriorated to 1-2 months. When investigating specific years with either low-or high -flow conditions, forecast skill increased with the extremity of the event. Although raw forecasts for both E-HYPE and EFAS were more skillful than HTESSEL, bias correction based on QM can signifi-cantly reduce the difference. In operational mode, the three forecast systems show comparable skill. In general, dry conditions can be forecasted with high success rates up to 3 months ahead, which is very promising for successful use of Rhine streamflow forecasts in downstream reservoir management.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Lake IJssel is the Netherlands' largest freshwater reservoir, with its main water source coming from a branch of the river Rhine. We investigate whether seasonal forecasts of river discharge can help in managing the lake level to create extra buffer capacity for dry periods. We compare three seasonal forecast systems and assess their quality. We find that statistical corrections are needed for all systems to be used. In spring discharge can be predicted up to 4 months ahead due to snow processes. In summer this time is shorter, but it increases with event extremity: severe low -flow events can be predicted longer ahead. This offers potential for water managers to base their lake management on other similar reservoirs.					; Wetterhall, Fredrik/I-2374-2012; van den Hurk, Bart/ABI-1654-2020	Pechlivanidis, Ilias/0000-0002-3416-317X; Hurkmans, Ruud/0009-0005-4125-2698; van den Hurk, Bart/0000-0003-3726-7086; Wetterhall, Fredrik/0000-0001-5331-9064; 													1525-755X	1525-7541				JUL	2023	24	7					1275	1290		10.1175/JHM-D-22-0107.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-22-0107.1													WOS:001036959300001

The temporal trends of stratification were analyzed alongside correlations with meteorological, hydrological, and water quality variables. Thermal stratification intensified with rising air temperature and sunshine duration, while hydrological factors like discharge and retention time affected SSI during periods with less than five days of water retention. During summer, fewer occurrences of intense rainfall or early rainfall before August led to stronger stratification. In fall, nutrient influx from external sources during summer stimulated algal growth, increasing Chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) concentrations. Summer rainfall had a significant impact on the strength and duration of stratification in Paldang Lake. Annual rainfall patterns and subsequent changes in discharge were key factors affecting the physical environment of the lake, which in turn determined water quality and the extent of algal blooms. We provide insights into the seasonal stratification and water quality variations in temperate river-type reservoirs like Paldang Lake. SSI and IC-i from this research can be applied to understand stratification and mixing dynamics in other lakes.

Groundwater nitrate in three distinct hydrogeologic and land-use settings in southwestern Ontario, Canada	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater nitrate is a concern in the Great Lakes Basin (GLB) of North America. Concentrations vary based on hydrogeologic setting and surface contamination pressures. The first objective of this study was to characterize groundwater nitrate trends in a spatial and temporal context across three unique hydrogeologic and land-use settings in the GLB, at research sites in Norfolk, Guelph, and Acton, in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The second objective was to compare groundwater nitrate trends at the sites to determine the potential influence of hydrogeologic setting on seasonal nitrate variability. Groundwater nitrate-N concentrations and additional parameters were measured at 25 monitoring wells at the three sites, once every 2 months from June 2014 to July 2016 (13 sampling events). The dominant land-use pressure at all three sites is agricultural; however, the type of agriculture and the amount of natural and urban land vary. The Guelph site had the highest nitrate concentrations, while the Acton and Norfolk mean concentrations were similar. Seasonally, nitrate was found to be highest during the spring and early summer periods at all three sites. Several monitoring locations had cyclical patterns in nitrate concentrations, while others remained consistent except for isolated peak events. Comparison of multiple years reveals the expression of a relationship between climatic conditions during winter months and nitrate concentrations, indicating the importance of antecedent conditions to groundwater nitrate concentrations. The combination of climatic conditions, land-use pressure, and hydrogeologic setting plays an important role in the characteristics of groundwater nitrate time-series trends.					; Parker, Beth/E-6013-2019	Parker, Beth/0000-0002-5513-7333; 													1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2020	28	5					1891	1908		10.1007/s10040-020-02156-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-020-02156-4		APR 2020											WOS:000528329600001

Light attenuation coefficients (Kd(490)) from SeaWiFS and Aqua MODIS satellites compared favorably with in situ measurements. Significant temporal and spatial trends and differences in Kd(490) were noted within all three of the lakes. Lake-wide average Kd(490) for Lake Superior did not exhibit any changes between 1998 and 2012. Annual Kd(490) values for Lake Huron, however, showed a significant negative trend during the study period using both SeaWiFS and MODIS datasets. Similarly, annual Kd(490) values of Lake Michigan declined between 1998 and 2010. Only in the offshore waters (>90 m depth) of northern Lake Michigan did Kd(490) increase but just after 2007. Photic depth increased significantly in both Lake Michigan (similar or equal to 5 m), and Lake Huron (similar or equal to 10 m) when comparing annual Kd(490) for pre- (1998-2001) and post-dreissenid mussel (2006-2010). At seasonal level, significant decreases in Kd(490) in lakes Michigan and Huron were mainly noted for the spring/fall/winter mixing periods. After these recent changes in water clarity, lake-wide photic depths in lakes Michigan and Huron superseded Lake Superior; thus, making Lake Superior no longer the clearest Great Lake. Several factors (e.g. filtering activities of quagga mussels, phosphorus abatement, climate change, etc.) are likely responsible for these large changes.

Here, we report on the first year-round observations available for any site in Taylor Valley. This dataset augments the year-round data obtained at Lake Vanda (Wright Valley) by winter-over crews during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The mean annual solar flux at Lake Hoare was 92 W m(-2) during 1986, the mean air temperature -17.3 degrees C, and the mean 3-m wind speed 3.3 m s(-1). The local climate is controlled by the wind regime during the 4-month sunless winter and by seasonal and diurnal variations in the incident solar flux during the remainder of the year. Temperature increases of 20 degrees-30 degrees C are frequently observed during the winter due to strong fohn winds descending from the Polar Plateau. A model incorporating nonsteady molecular diffusion into Kolmogorov-scale eddies in the interfacial layer and similarity-theory flux-profiles in the surface sublayer, is used to determine the rate of ice sublimation from the acquired meteorological data. Despite the frequent occurrence of strong winter fohns, the bulk of the annual ablation occurs during the summer due to elevated temperatures and persistent moderate winds. The annual ablation from Lake Hoare is estimated to have been 35.0 +/- 6.3 cm for 1986.

Heavy metal levels (especially Zn) were highly variable in both types of samples. The (volume-weighted) average concentrations of total N, NH4+ and NO3- in bulk precipitation were 0.82, 0.12 and 0.23 mg of N/l, respectively.

Highest nutrient concentrations occurred in spring and early summer. Total loadings of N and P from bulk precipitation (1.15 g N and 0.12 g P/(m2 .cntdot. yr)) were above permissible rates (relative to eutrophication) for shallow lakes. The volume-weighted mean pH of wet-only precipitation was 4.53; bulk precipitation had a slightly higher pH. Lowest pH values occurred in spring and summer.

Betula expansion and contraction of herb tundra vegetation characterize the Younger Dryas on the Kenai, suggesting increased winter snowfall concurrent with cool, sunny summers. Remarkable Polypodiaceae (fern) abundance between 11,500 and 8500 cal yr BP implies a significant change in climate. Enhanced peat preservation and the occurrence of wet meadow species suggest high moisture from 11,500 to 10,700 cal yr BP, in contrast to drier conditions in southeastern Alaska; this pattern may indicate an intensification and repositioning of the Aleutian Low (AL). Drier conditions oil the Kenai Peninsula from 10,700 to 8500 call yr BP may signify a weaker AL, but elevated fern abundance may have been sustained by high seasonality with substantial snowfall and enhanced glacial melt. Decreased insolation-induced seasonality resulted in climatic cooling after 8500 cal yr BP, with increased humidity from 8000 to 5000 cal yr BP. A dry interval punctuated by volcanic activity occurred between 5000 and 3500 call yr BP, followed by cool, moist climate, coincident with Neoglaciation. Tsuga mertensiana expanded after similar to 1500 cal yr BP in response to the shift to cooler conditions. (C) 2009 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used as a proxy of land surface responses to climate changes to a certain degree. In this study, we demonstrate the significant correlation between preceding wintertime Arctic polar vortex intensity (WAPVI) and springtime NDVI (SNDVI) over a 34-year period (1982-2015) in boreal Eurasia (50A degrees-75A degrees N, 0A degrees-150A degrees E). Results show that a positive phase of WAPVI tends to increase the SNDVI in Europe and Lake Baikal, but causes a significant decrease in Siberia; the physical mechanisms involved in this relationship are then investigated. A positive phase of WAPVI leads to anomalies in surface air temperature and rainfall over Eurasia, which then induces a significant decrease in snow cover and snow depth in Europe and Lake Baikal and an increase of snow depth in Siberia. The colder ground temperature in Siberia during spring is considered responsible for the stronger snow depth and weaker vegetation growth in this region. The weaker and thinner snow cover in Europe and Baikal produces a decrease in albedo and an increase in heat. Thin snow melts fast in the following spring and land releases more heat to the atmosphere; consequently, warm and moist land surface facilitates vegetation growth in Europe and the Baikal regions during positive WAPVI years. In addition, WAPVI can induce sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Atlantic, which displays a tripole pattern similar to that of the empirical mode pattern in winter. Furthermore, the SST anomalous pattern persisting from winter to spring can trigger a stationary wave-train propagating from west to east in boreal Eurasia, with "negative-positive-negative-positive" geopotential height anomalies, which further exerts an impact on vegetation growth through modulation of the heat balance.

The extent to which a reach or lake within a river network uptakes DOC depends on the stream order, the seasonal conditions, and the flow. At the watershed scale, it remains unclear whether DOC uptake is dominated by biological processes such as respiration, or abiotic processes like photomineralization. The partitioning of DOC uptake in lakes vs. rivers is also unclear. In this study, we present a new model that unifies year-round controls on DOC cycling for an entire river network, including river-lake connectivity, to elucidate the importance of biotic vs. abiotic controls on DOC uptake. We present the Catchment UPtake and Sinks by Season, Order, and Flow for DOC (CUPS-OF-DOC) model, which quantifies terrestrial DOC loading, gross primary productivity, and uptake via microbes and photomineralization. The model is applied to the Connecticut River Watershed, and accounts for cascading reach- and lake-scale DOC cycling across 98 scenarios spanning combinations of flows, seasons, and stream orders. We show that riverine DOC uptake is nearly constant with stream order, but the proportion of DOC uptake from photomineralization varies. Photomineralization dominates in rivers in most flow conditions and stream orders, especially in winter, accounting for at least half of whole-watershed DOC uptake in February across all flows. Whole-watershed summer DOC uptake occurs mostly via biomineralization in lakes, accounting for 80% of DOC uptake during the growing season, despite accounting for less than 6% of watershed open water surface area.					; Aho, Kelly/AAW-8790-2021; Maavara, Taylor/O-1395-2017; Stubbins, Aron/NBX-8318-2025; Brinkerhoff, Craig/GQH-8417-2022; Hosen, Jacob/AAK-5258-2020; Raymond, Peter/C-4087-2009	Brinkerhoff, Craig/0000-0001-6701-4835; Maavara, Taylor/0000-0001-6677-9262; Logozzo, Laura/0000-0001-9363-2143; Aho, Kelly/0000-0002-1992-6378; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2023	68	3					735	751		10.1002/lno.12306	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12306		JAN 2023											WOS:000921682200001

The goods and services of these isolated wetlands are highly sensitive to variations in precipitation and temperature. We evaluated the flood proofing of isolated wetlands (pothole wetlands) under various climate change scenarios in the Upper Assiniboine River Basin (UARB) at Kamsack, a headwater catchment of the Lake of the Prairies in the Canadian portion of the PPR. A modified version of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was utilized to simulate projected streamflow under the potential impacts of climate change, along with changes to the distribution of pothole wetlands. Significant increases in winter streamflow (-200%) and decreases (similar to 11%) in summer flow, driven by changes in future climates, were simulated. Simulated changes in streamflow resulting from pothole removal were between 55% for winter and 15% for summer, suggesting that climate will be the primary driver in the future hydrologic regime of the study region. This research serves as an important guide to the various stakeholder organizations involved in quantifying the aggregate impacts of pothole wetlands in the hydrology of the Canadian Prairie Region.					jha, sanjeev/AAU-3091-2020; Stadnyk, Tricia/ABC-8061-2021	Stadnyk, Tricia/0000-0002-2145-4963; Boluwade, Alaba/0000-0002-6396-0637; Muhammad, Ameer/0000-0002-3689-5577														2073-4441				NOV	2018	10	11							1657	10.3390/w10111657	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10111657													WOS:000451736300164
J	Bussmann, I				Bussmann, I			Methane release through resuspension of littoral sediment	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Sediment in the littoral zone of lakes is frequently disturbed by wave action or bioturbation, resulting in sediment resuspension. In undisturbed sediment, methanotrophic bacteria efficiently reduce the diffusive flux of methane into the water column. In a microcosm study, the resuspension of littoral sediment was simulated in sediment cores for a winter (n = 3) and a summer situation (n = 3). The erosion of surface sediment resulted in a large flux of methane into the overlying water (207 +/- 176 mu mol h(-1) m(-2) in winter and 73 +/- 18 mu mol h(-1) m(-2) in summer). Only a minor part (16 +/- 7%) of the methane released was oxidized by methanotrophic bacteria, whereas the major part escaped into the water column. Only 6-16% of the littoral zone has to be resuspended to reach the same flux as from undisturbed littoral sediment. For the daily flux, a sediment resuspension has to last 1-4 h to reach the undisturbed daily flux. The study reveals the important role of sediment resuspension in the littoral methane cycle as an intense but variable source of methane of largely unknown magnitude.

J	Czerniawska, J; Chlachula, J				Czerniawska, Jolanta; Chlachula, Jiri			Climate-Change Induced Permafrost Degradation in Yakutia, East Siberia	ARCTIC												Current climate change in the northern regions is a well-recognized phenomenon. In central Yakutia (the Sakha Republic), the long-term trend displays a consistent mean annual air temperature (MAAT) increase from -9.6 degrees C (1980) to -6.7 degrees C (2019), corresponding to an average 0.07 degrees C annual rise, with pronounced temperature anomalies in the last decade. The analyzed meteorological records of the past 40 years indicate a progressing climate change pattern of increased MAAT and mean annual precipitation (MAP) that occurs in 5-7 yr cycles. The complex interactions of regional climatic variations with local geological and environmental conditions influence the frozen ground's thermal balance, which, in turn, impacts thermokarst development. Co-acting factors of temperature rise and higher precipitation rates activate thermokarst lake dynamics and lake expansion following snow- and rainfall-rich preceding years. April experiences the greatest warming trend with a present (2020) 5 degrees C rise from 1980 with shortening of the winter season. Climate warming together with natural forest fires and anthropogenic activities (pastoral practices and logging) contribute to the taiga landscape opening due to reduced albedo and the greater exposure to solar radiation. The regional hydrologic network undergoes restructuring caused by drained meltwater released from the degraded cryolithozone with peaks of the fluvial discharge in late spring and early summer generating bank erosion. The negative effects of the progressing ground thaw, which are particularly observed in lowland locations, pose risks to local settlements and generate major environmental and engineering problems in the formerly permafrost-stable central and northern areas of Siberia.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	2020	73	4					509	528		10.14430/arctic71674	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic71674													WOS:000604328900008

While management efforts and research are focused on the control and on the impacts of aquatic weeds on biodiversity, their influence on shallow lakes' biogeochemical cycles is still unwell explored. The aim of the present study is to understand whether invasive aquatic plants may affect the biogeochemistry of shallow lakes and act as ecosystem engineers. We performed a multi-year investigation (2013-2015) of dissolved biogeochemical parameters in an oligo-mesotrophic shallow lake of south-west of France (Lacanau Lake), where wind-sheltered bays are colonized by dense mats of exotic Egeria densa Planch. and Lagarosiphon major (Ridl.) Moss. We collected seasonal samples at densely vegetated and plant-free areas, in order to extrapolate and quantify the role of the presence of invasive plants on the biogeochemistry, at the macrophyte stand scale and at the lake scale. Results revealed that elevated plant biomass triggers oxygen (O-2), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and nitrogen (DIN) stratification, with hypoxia events frequently occurring at the bottom of the water column. Within plants bed, elevated respiration rates generated important amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and ammonium (NH4+). The balance between benthic nutrients regeneration and fixation into biomass results strictly connected to the seasonal lifecycle of the plants. Indeed, during summer, DIC and DIN regenerated from the sediment are quickly fixed into plant biomass and sustain elevated growth rates. On the opposite, in spring and autumn, bacterial and plant respiration overcome nutrients fixation, resulting in an excess of nutrients in the water and in the increase of carbon emission toward the atmosphere. Our study suggests that aquatic weeds may perform as ecosystem engineers, by negatively affecting local oxygenation and by stimulating nutrients regeneration.

Impact of ice sheet induced North Atlantic oscillation on East Asian summer monsoon during an interglacial 500,000 years ago	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 13, an interglacial about 500,000 years ago, is unique due to an exceptionally strong East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) occurring in a relatively cool climate with low greenhouse gas concentrations (GHG). This paper attempts to find one of the possible mechanisms for this seeming paradox. Simulations with an Earth System model LOVECLIM show that the presence of ice sheets over North America and Eurasia during MIS-13 induces a positive phase of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) like feature. The ocean having a longer memory than the atmosphere, the oceanic anomalies associated with NAO persists until summer. The signals of summer NAO are transmitted to East Asia to reinforce the monsoon there through the stationary waves excited at the Asian Jet entrance. The geopotential height shows clearly a mid-latitude wave train with positive anomalies over the eastern Mediterranean/Caspian Sea and the Okhotsk Sea and a negative anomaly over Lake Baikal. This reinforces the effect of the high-latitude wave train induced independently by the Eurasian ice sheet topography as shown in previous study. These features reinforce the Meiyu front and enhance the precipitation over East Asia. The results obtained from LOVECLIM are further confirmed by an atmospheric general circulation model, ARPEGE.

Fugitive Dust Emissions from Paved Road Travel in the Lake Tahoe Basin	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION												The clarity of water in Lake Tahoe has declined substantially over the past 40 yr. Causes of the degradation include nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization of the lake waters and increasing amounts of inorganic fine sediment that can scatter light. Atmospheric deposition is a major source of fine sediment. A year-round monitoring study of road dust emissions around the lake was completed in 2007 using the Testing Re-entrained Aerosol Kinetic Emissions from Roads (TRAKER) system developed at the Desert Research Institute (DRI). Results of this study found that, compared with the summer season, road dust emissions increased by a factor of 5 in winter, on average, and about a factor of 10 when traction control material was applied to the roads after snow events. For winter and summer, road dust emission factors (grams coarse particulate matter [PM10] per vehicle kilometer traveled [g/vkt]) showed a decreasing trend with the travel speed of the road. The highest emission factors were observed on very low traffic volume roads on the west side of the lake. These roads were composed of either a 3/8-in. gravel material or had degraded asphalt. The principle factors influencing road dust emissions in the basin are season, vehicle speed (or road type), road condition, road grade, and proximity to other high-emitting roads. Combined with a traffic volume model, an analysis of the. total emissions from the road sections surveyed indicated that urban areas (in particular South Lake Tahoe) had the highest emitting roads in the basin.

Trait-based approaches are promising but yet rarely applied to understand community dynamics in response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we investigate seasonal succession patterns of functional traits in phytoplankton communities and how nutrient reductions (oligotrophication) alter these patterns. We used phytoplankton data from 40 years of observation from the Rappbode Reservoir (Germany), which underwent a strong shift in trophic conditions, and translated taxonomic composition into functional traits by assigning trait values compiled from the literature. All studied traits (morphological, behavioural and physiological traits) responded to changing environmental conditions and showed consistent, reoccurring seasonal developments. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton communities was shaped by a trade-off between small-celled, fast-growing species that are able to rapidly incorporate existing resources (r-strategists) and large-celled species with more complex and efficient mechanisms to exploit scarce mineral nutrients or acquire previously unexploited nutrient pools (k-strategists). In summer, when nutrients were scarce, the k-strategy was prevailing (important traits: phosphate affinity, nitrogen fixation, motility and mixotrophy). During the rest of the year, nutrients and turbulence were high and r-strategists dominated (important traits: maximum growth rate and light affinity). A comparison between eutrophic and oligotrophic years revealed that the main features of functional trait succession were largely preserved, but intra-annual fluctuations from spring to summer were stronger during eutrophic years. Nutrient reductions mainly affected functional traits and biomass in spring, while in summer the functional community composition changed little. Synthesis. This study provides for the first time a quantitatively supported functional template for trait-based succession patterns in lakes under different nutrient conditions. By translating taxonomic composition into trait information, we demonstrate that the quantification of functional characteristics enables ecological interpretation of observed community dynamics and provides not only a testable template but also a powerful tool towards a more mechanistic understanding. The quantification of functional traits further improves the predictability of community shifts in response to changing environmental conditions and thus opens new perspectives for predictive limnology using lake ecosystem models.

In this paper, we describe the characteristics of unexploited black bass populations from Spencer Lake, a remote, oligotrophic body of water located on Blakely Island, Washington which contains only three species of fish (small mouth bass, largemouth bass, and prickly sculpin) and has no public access. We used a variety of active and passive sampling techniques (an.-ling. diving, gill netting, and tyke netting) to collect or observe fish during spring, summer, and fall 2001. Data on the size and age structure, and condition of smallmouth bass and largemouth bass are provided. The black bass populations at Spencer Lake are similar to some unexploited populations (small to moderate size fish, slow growth, and presence of old fish in poor condition) but differ from others, in particular those having a high proportion of large individuals. Our results indicate that smallmouth bass and, to a lesser degree, largemouth bass are not reaching their full growth potential, which may be due to several factors, including inadequate food supply, low lake productivity, and inter- or intraspecific competition.

Our reconstruction indicates two dramatic lake level increases - a late glacial (ca. 16.4-12.6 cal kyr B.P.) rise of 65 m, and a 47 m rise during the early Holocene wet phase (ca. 11.2-8.5 cal kyr B.P.) which are separated by the Younger Dryas (YD) event. We decouple the role of precipitation seasonality and snow melt using a combination of proxies sensitive to the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), and a regional spatio-temporal transect that provides information on the eastward penetration of the winter westerlies. A comparison of shallow and deep water cores shows that (i) the first lake level increase (similar to 65 m, ca. 16.4-12.6 cal kyr B.P.) is caused by melt water inflow triggered by the increasing summer insolation; (ii) the second lake level increase (similar to 47 m, 11.2-8.5 cal kyr B.P.) is largely caused by a rise in annual precipitation coupled with reduced summer evaporation; (iii) in contrast to the onset of ISM (Bay of Bengal branch) at ca. 14.7 ka in lower elevations in NE India, the hydroclimatic influence of ISM in the high altitude Himalaya is seen only between 12.7 and 12 cal kyr B.P., though the influence of solar insolation (via increased snowmelt) is visible from 16.4 cal kyr B.P. onwards; (iv) the eastward penetration of westerlies in Indian Himalayas is strongly influenced by the strength of the Siberian High.					; Ambili, Anoop/AAR-7122-2020; Mishra, Praveen K./AAC-7064-2022; Jehangir, Arshid/AAC-9077-2021; Gaye, Birgit/J-4621-2012	Mishra, Praveen K./0000-0003-3860-892X; Gaye, Birgit/0000-0002-5057-899X; Ambili, Anoop/0000-0002-4279-7842; Jehangir, Arshid/0000-0002-4877-609X													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 15	2018	493						20	29		10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.026													WOS:000425071100003
J	Saeed, F; Almazroui, M; Islam, N; Khan, MS				Saeed, Fahad; Almazroui, Mansour; Islam, Nazrul; Khan, Mariam Saleh			Intensification of future heat waves in Pakistan: a study using CORDEX regional climate models ensemble	NATURAL HAZARDS												Future trends in the occurrence of heat waves (HW) over Pakistan have been presented using three regional climate models (RCMs), forced by three different global climate models (GCMs) runs under RCP8.5 scenarios. The results of RCMs are obtained from CORDEX (Coordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment) database. Two different approaches for the assessment of HWs are defined, namely Fixed and Relative approaches. Fixed approach is defined for a life-threatening extreme event in which the temperature can reach more than 45 A degrees C for a continuous stretch of several days; however, Relative approach events may not be directly life-threatening, but may cause snow/ice melt flooding and impact on food security of the country in summer and winter seasons, respectively. The results indicate a consistent increase in the occurrence of HWs for both approaches. For the Fixed approach, the increase is evident in the eastern areas of Pakistan, particularly plains of Punjab and Sindh provinces which host many big cities of the country. It is argued that the effect of HWs may also be exacerbated in future due to urban heat island effect. Moreover, summer time HWs for Relative approach is most likely to increase over northern areas of the country which hosts reservoirs of snow and glacier, which may result in events like glacial lake outburst flood and snow/ice melt flooding. Furthermore, the increase in winter time HWs for Relative approach may affect negatively on the wheat production, which in turn can distress the overall food productivity and livelihoods of the country. It is concluded that this study may be a useful document for future planning in order to better adapt to these threats due to climate change.

It characterizes with extremely high biodiversity, being one of the last wetlands along the Lower Danube preserved in relatively natural state; the lake area is NATURA 2000 site. This study was designed to further research on the impact of intensive agriculture on the lake's ecological status. First task was to find an evidence for link between intensive agriculture and the loading of the lake with nutrients. The second was a study on the PAH's penetration into the lake ecosystem. An overview was made on drinking water data for 2 underground (drinking water springs). Dyalcova spring's water displayed good ecological state after measured parameters PO43-, NO32-, NO2- and pH. Todorankina spring did not fell within the boundaries of good and very good conditions. Increased nitrate levels in water samples leads us to conclude that agriculture in this part of the surrounding area affect groundwater quality in the biosphere reserve. Results from GC-MS analysis proved, that there is no groundwater contamination, responsible for the existing (although low) concentrations of PAH found in the lake.																			1898-6196						2012	19	4					639	647		10.2478/v10216-011-0046-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10216-011-0046-3													WOS:000314702100011
J	Ager, TA; Phillips, RL				Ager, Thomas A.; Phillips, R. Lawrence			Pollen evidence for late Pleistocene Bering land bridge environments from Norton Sound, northeastern Bering Sea, Alaska	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												After more than half a century of paleoenvironmental investigations, disagreements persist as to the nature of vegetation type and climate of the Bering land bridge (BLB) during the late Wisconsin (Sartan) glacial interval. Few data exist from sites on the former land bridge, now submerged under the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Two hypotheses have emerged during the past decade. The first, based on pollen data from Bering Sea islands and adjacent mainlands of western Alaska and Northeast Siberia, represents the likely predominant vegetation on the Bering land bridge during full-glacial conditions: graminoid-herb-willow tundra vegetation associated with cold, dry winters and cool, dry summer climate. The second hypothesis suggests that dwarf birch-shrub-herb tundra formed a broad belt across the BLB, and that mesic vegetation was associated with cold, snowier winters and moist, cool summers. As a step towards resolving this controversy, a sediment core from Norton Sound, northeastern Bering Sea was radiocarbon dated and analyzed for pollen content. Two pollen zones were identified. The older, bracketed by radiocarbon ages of 29,500 and 11,515 C-14 yr BP, contains pollen assemblages composed of grass, sedge, wormwood, willow, and a variety of herb (forb) taxa. These assemblages are interpreted to represent graminoid-herb-willow tundra vegetation that developed under an arid, cool climate regime. The younger pollen zone sediments were deposited about 11,515 C-14 yr BP, when rising sea level had begun to flood the BLB. This younger pollen zone contains pollen of birch, willow, heaths, aquatic plants, and spores of sphagnum moss. This is interpreted to represent a Lateglacial dwarf birch-heath-willow-herb tundra vegetation, likely associated with a wetter climate with deeper winter snows, and moist, cool summers. This record supports the first hypothesis, that graminoid-herb-willow tundra vegetation extended into the lowlands of the BLB during full glacial conditions of the late Wisconsin.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2008	40	3					451	461		10.1657/1523-0430(07-076)[AGER]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(07-076)[AGER]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000258967100001

In this study, such an assessment was conducted based on the trophic status index, phytoplankton biomass, the ratio of zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass, eco-exergy, structural eco-exergy, and ecological buffer capacity to total phosphorus for phytoplankton. First, the spatial and temporal variations of the ecosystem status in Poyang Lake were assessed based on these six indicators. Then, cluster analysis was utilized to classify the 15 sites based on the various indicators and to identify the most influential indicators. The results showed that the ecological status of Poyang Lake was affected not only by eutrophication but also by hydrological characteristics. All of the 15 sites had deteriorated to a certain degree. An analysis of the relative spatial ecological status showed that the status of the water in the rivers was superior to the status of water in the central lake. Furthermore, the relative ecological status was found to be best in summer and second best in autumn with ecological status deteriorating in winter. There was no significant correlation between eco-exergy and trophic status index, but a very strong relationship was found between eco-exergy and macrozoobenthos biomass with an R-2 of 0.92, indicating that macrozoobenthos contributed greatly to the eco-exergy.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023														1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-MAR	2016	19	1					29	39		10.1080/14634988.2016.1140979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2016.1140979													WOS:000373112700003

We estimated methanotrophic bacterial production (MBP), methanotrophic bacterial growth efficiency (MBGE), heterotrophic bacterial production (HBP), primary production (PP), and the relative contribution of methanotrophic bacteria to overall bacterial biomass in three very different lakes during summer and winter. In addition, we measured stable carbon isotope ratios in particulate organic matter (POM), surface sediments, zooplankton, and methane. MBP corresponded to 0.3-7% of the organic C production by primary producers, and 0.5-17% of HBP during summer. During winter, MBP was 3-120% of HBR MBP generally dominated the heterotrophic bacterial production at greater depths. Methanotrophic biomass was 3-11% of total bacterial biomass on a depth-integrated basis. Zooplankton were generally more depleted in C-13 than POM. If phytoplankton delta(13)C signatures were -35 to -30parts per thousand, such as the POM signals, observed zooplankton signatures could be explained by a fraction of 5-15% methanotrophic bacteria in their diet. The results indicate that methanotrophic bacteria can provide a significant food source for zooplankton, and that methane oxidation represents a potentially important benthic-pelagic carbon and energy link in many lakes, particularly during winter.

Trend Reversal in Lake Michigan Contribution to Snowfall	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												One of the most notable ways the Laurentian Great Lakes impact the region's climate is by augmenting snowfall in downwind locations during autumn and winter months. Among many negative consequences, this surplus of snow can cause substantial property damage to homes and can escalate the number of traffic accident-related injuries and fatalities. The consensus among several previous studies is that lake-effect snowfall increased during the twentieth century in various locations in the Great Lakes region. The goal of this study is to better understand variability and long-term trends in Lake Michigan's lake-contribution snowfall (LCS). LCS accounts for both lake-effect and lake-enhanced events. In addition, this study updates findings from previous investigations using snowfall observations found by a recent study to be appropriate for climate studies. It is demonstrated that considerable variability exists in 5-yr periods of LCS east and south of Lake Michigan from 1920 to 2005. A general increase in LCS from the early 1920s to the 1950-80 period at locations typically downwind of the lake was found. Thereafter, LCS decreased through the early 2000s, indicating a distinct trend reversal that is not reported by earlier studies. The reasons for this reversal are unclear. The reversal is consistent with observed increasing minimum temperatures during winter months after the 1970s, however.

METABOLISM AND NET GROWTH EFFICIENCY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha from 3 sites in lakes were estimated regularly over the course of 1 1/2 years at ambient temperature. They showed a pronounced annual cycle, when expressed in absolute terms (at standard shell length) and in weight specific terms (at standard tissue weight). The atomic ratio of oxygen consumed to ammonia-N released (O/N ratio) was lowest in late summer at all sites (10 to 20) and highest during winter and spring (50 to > 100). The mean body weight exponent pooled from these sites was 0.78 (95% confidence interval+/-0.07) for the oxygen consumption rate and 0.80 (confidence interval+/-0.10) for the ammonia excretion rate. Both oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion were significantly correlated with the water temperature at the 2 shallow water sites, where temperature variation was most pronounced. Correlation with seston content or gonad volume were insignificant at these sites. The quotient of filtration capacity to oxygen consumption rate was about 3 times higher at the site with the poorest food conditions compared to the other sites. Net growth efficiency was highly variable; its annual average was 35 to 40 per cent and independent of locality and animal size.																			0018-8158					MAY 12	1995	304	2					147	158		10.1007/BF02579419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02579419													WOS:A1995RC89600005
J	Reinart, A; Pedusaar, T				Reinart, Anu; Pedusaar, Tiia			Reconstruction of the time series of the underwater light climate in a shallow turbid lake	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Lake Ulemiste is a shallow, eutrophic lake which has served the city of Tallinn as a water reservoir for many centuries. Its light climate was studied by combining a routinely measured data set with a modelling approach. For 26 years (1978 - 2004), data was collected on such optically active substances (OAS) and water parameters as water colour, turbidity and phytoplankton biomass. Simple modelling enabled the quantification of long-term time-series data and the subsequent calculation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient, euphotic depth and average light of the mixed layer. Several changes in the hydrological cycle have taken place during the period under study, among which are an increase in the water level of about 0.5 m and a decrease in the external water load from 108 million m(3) year(-1) to about 25 million m(3) year(-1). At the same time euphotic depth has shown a distinct trend towards increasing since the early 1990s. The euphotic depth also showed an increase (from 1.1 to 1.4 m) due to an improvement in underwater light conditions - mainly in the spring (April and May) and autumn (October and November) because of the lower amount of dissolved organic matter in the lake. The average light availability in the mixed layer has increased, but this has not affected the phytoplankton biomass as the latter is not light-limited during the summer period.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2008	42	1					5	15		10.1007/s10452-006-9056-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-006-9056-0													WOS:000253197700002
J	Riera, JL; Schindler, JE; Kratz, TK				Riera, JL; Schindler, JE; Kratz, TK			Seasonal dynamics of carbon dioxide and methane in two clear-water lakes and two bog lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We investigated carbon dynamics in the water column and CO2, and CH4 exchange across the air-water interface in four closed-basin lakes in northern Wisconsin: two with clear, low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) waters and two bog lakes with stained, high-DOG waters. Clear-water lakes quickly became undersaturated following ice-out and remained undersaturated until fall turnover. Bog lakes were supersaturated in CO2 throughout the ice-free season, although surface CO2 concentrations dropped sharply following ice-out and increased again during autumn turnover. Differences in seasonal patterns of CO2 were attributed to morphometry and the timing and intensity of mixing events. Ice-free season fluxes of CO2 were 6.7 and 10.0 mol.m(-2) in the bog lakes and 1.2 and 0.09 mol.m(-2) in the clear-water lakes. Fluxes of CH4 were significant only immediately after ice-out and during autumn turnover and were <0.4 mol.m(-2) in the bog lakes and <0.05 mol.m(-2) in the clear-water lakes. Compared with changes in carbon pools in the lakes, our results indicate rapid carbon turnover rates in bog lakes, as opposed to clear-water lakes. We suggest that allochthonous inputs of CO2 may be responsible for this rapid turnover.

High densities of water-birds at two New Zealand fresh-water urban lakes	NOTORNIS												We compared summer counts of water-birds (November-January, 2012-2016; mainly Anatidae, Phalacrocoracidae, Rallidae, Laridae) at 2 small, shallow, urban lakes set in parkland surroundings: Western Springs Lake (Auckland) and Henley Lake (Masterton), New Zealand. We recorded 25 species of water-birds; 17 at Western Springs Lake and 22 at Henley Lake, with 14 species in common. The average total densities (and biomasses) were 61 birds/ha (113 kg/ha) at Western Springs Lake, significantly higher than the 40 birds/ha (95 kg/ha) at Henley Lake. Ducks (Tadorninae, Anatinae) made the biggest single contribution to numbers at both lakes (40-60% of total water-bird density). Swans and geese (Anserinae) were less common than ducks but because they were heavier birds they accounted for 60-70% of total biomass, and were therefore the main consumers of food and producers of droppings. Introduced water-birds made up 60-70% of the density at both lakes, and 80-90% of the biomass, with no significant differences between lakes. The presence of some native species (in significantly greater total density and biomass at Western Springs Lake), and breeding of the endemic New Zealand scaup at both sites, illustrate the potential conservation value of New Zealand's small urban lakes.					; Gill, Brian/I-9553-2019	Gill, Brian/0000-0003-4026-2905; 													0029-4470	1177-7680					2018	65	2					84	91																WOS:000445205000003

Temporal dynamics of freshwater bacterio- and virioplankton along a littoral-pelagic gradient	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Viruses have been identified as an important component of plankton communities but their temporal dynamics remain poorly characterized, especially in littoral zones of lakes. Seasonal and diel dynamics of planktonic viruses and their main hosts (i.e. bacteria) were therefore assessed along four parallel transects of a lake, extending from within a littoral reed stand across the littoral shelf to the pelagic zone. 2. Viral abundance ranged from 1.9 to 9.7 x 10(7) virus-like particles (VLP) mL(-1) with distinct seasonal peaks in spring at all locations. Seasonal variation in bacterial abundance varied more than 10-fold (0.85-12 x 10(6) cells mL(-1)) and was synchronized with changes in viral abundance. As a result, the ratio of viruses to bacteria (average of 12.5) varied much less over the year. 3. Bacterial production (0.11-0.98 mu g C L(-1) h(-1)) and growth rates (0.06-0.85 day(-1)) also varied seasonally but, in contrast to abundances, high production rates in spring were maintained in mid-summer, particularly in the reed stand, where growth rates were highest. 4. Variation among locations was small in most measured parameters, probably due to extensive exchange between pelagic and littoral water masses. Nevertheless, average bacterial growth and production rates in all seasons were consistently highest in the reed stand. 5. In the August of an exceptionally warm summer, viral and bacterial abundance varied little over a diel cycle (1.23-1.75 x 10(8) VLP mL(-1) and 0.78-1.90 x 10(7) cells mL(-1), respectively) in spite of a trend towards higher values at night. Diel changes in bacterial production (0.23-0.69 mu g C L(-1) h(-1)) and growth rate (0.02-0.06 day(-1)) were more pronounced, with higher values also occurring during the night, possibly indicating that bacterio- and phytoplankton production were not tightly coupled during our diel study. 6. Overall these results indicate that seasonal changes of virio- and bacterioplankton were mainly driven by high microbial activity in spring and were more pronounced than either diel changes on a hot summer day or spatial differences at a scale of 10-100 m.																			0046-5070					JUN	2008	53	6					1114	1125		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01886.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01886.x													WOS:000255713100005

Comparison of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) growth, condition, and energy density between lakes Erie and Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Patterns in abundance, growth, and condition of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) from Lake Erie were compared with those from Lake Ontario. Discontinuous assessment data were available from 1972 to 2003 for each lake to describe abundance, growth, and condition, while a seasonally intensive field program was undertaken in 2003 to describe diet, energy density, and gonadosomatic index (GSI). Through time, abundance declined more in Lake Ontario than in Lake Erie. Length-at-age (growth) and condition both declined significantly in Lake Ontario but did not change in Lake Erie. Diet analysis revealed chironomids, dreissenid mussels and sphaeriids made up the bulk of lake whitefish diet in Lake Erie. Diet in Lake Ontario exhibited more seasonal variability with amphipods and gastropods comprising the bulk of the spring and fall diets, and dreissenid mussels dominating summer diets. Lake whitefish energy density (J/g wet mass) was significantly higher in Lake Erie than in Lake Ontario, increasing with body mass and strongly correlated with water content. Female gonadosomatic index was also significantly greater in Lake Erie than in Lake Ontario. Biological attributes of lake whitefish from Lake Erie did not change greatly from the late 1980s to 2003 while fish from Lake Ontario exhibited decreased size-at-age and condition likely due to decreased energy content of diets compared to pre-dreissenid mussel conditions, and possibly lower availability of benthic prey compared to Lake Erie.

This lake is very shallow (0.5 m max. depth during 1987-88) and relatively large (+/- 1350 ha). It is a temporary playa lake, showing irregular cycles, with frequent seasonal drought and a high degree of unpredictability. The lake was sampled monthly during a relatively rainy year (1987-88, 10.5 months permanence). The result of combined analyses for environmental variables (salinity, temperature and soluble inorganic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus), variables related to biological activity (chlorophyll 'a', sediment organic matter and redox potential) and the direct analysis of the planktonic community, shows the existence of two periods of dominance by autotrophs. The first occurs during winter, exhibits a progressively higher surface to volume ratio for phytoplankton and is followed in the spring by high zooplankton densities (Moina salina, Fabrea salina) and very low phytoplankton densities, suggesting the existence of a period with a detritus-based food web. The summer period coincides with a community better adapted to high salinities that is dominated by Dunaliella salina, D. viridis, diatoms and the ciliate Fabrea salina, and associated with high ammonium concentrations. A new period of organic matter accumulation could be facilitated, in the last moments before the lake dries, by a progressive decrease in zooplankton abundance.

Furthermore, short-term topography change is also discussed on the basis of sand grain characteristics obtained from on-site surveys. In summer this lake has a large inflow from Nagase River, and in winter it has strong and high waves because of seasonal wind. Thus, the lake does not have both of those influences of natural force simultaneously in a year. That is why the processes of the shoreline change are simpler in the lake. The main conclusion is that the sediment supplied from the river moves to the east, because the seasonal wind from northwest direction causes the strong and large waves propagates in eastern direction in winter, resulting in longshore sediment to the east.																					981-238-090-6				2002							853	858																WOS:000180463100157

Despite their ecological significance, little is known about their seasonal co-occurrence patterns and the ecological processes that drive them. In this study, we aimed to investigate the ecological associations among bacterial taxa and assembly processes of PBC and BBC in different seasons. We used 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing of a total of 150 water and sediment samples collected from multiple lakes distributed in an urban region of China during winter and summer. Our results revealed that PBC showed stronger seasonal variations in co-occurrence patterns than BBC, suggesting that BBC had greater temporal stability than PBC. Winter PBC network was characterized by higher connectivity and complexity, and thereby the formation of a highly stable community structure; whereas lower connectivity arising from the presence of fewer predicted keystone taxa (hubs and connectors in a network) was destabilizing to summer PBC network. In addition, the phylum Firmicutes identified as a putative keystone taxon of PBC in both seasons played a non-negligible role in maintaining network structure which may result from strong functional associations with other bacterioplankton.Tempera Temperature and pH were the best explanatory factors predicting the seasonal co-occurrence patterns of PBC and BBC, respectively. Normalized stochasticity ratio based on null-model analysis indicated that deterministic processes overwhelmed stochastic processes in governing the assembly of PBC and BBC in both seasons. However, we observed a greater influence of ecological stochasticity on BBC assembly than PBC assembly in both seasons. Taken together, these findings provide insights into understanding the impacts of habitat heterogeneity and seasonal variability on microbial assemblage patterns in lake ecosystems.

This study aims to determine how these factors affect spatial and seasonal variations in sedimentation rate in the epilimnion and hypolimnion of Lake Gosciaz. To determine sedimentation rates. six sedimentation traps were set up at different locations and depths in the lake. Weather data were obtained from a meteorological station near the lake. Furthermore, temperature in the lake water column was measured continuously, and during field work oxygenation and transparency were also measured. Seasonal changes in sediment composition were analyzed on smear slides under microscope. The study showed that sedimentation rate increased as bottom steepness increased, and that there was more sediment in the hypolimnion than the epilimnion, especially in spring and autumn. There was a clear seasonal variation in early-spring and autumn peaks in sedimentation. The obtained results were significantly dependent on bottom relief, wind and air temperature through these factors' influence on water temperature. The results show that the sediment accumulation rate in Lake Gosciaz depends on the hydrodynamic conditions, which are determined by wind speed, wind direction, water temperature, and the shape and steepness of the lake basin. The relief features of the lake bottom and its orientation relative to the prevailing wind are significant factors in the spatial differentiation in sediment accumulation rate and composition of sedimenting material. It has been shown that the lake's shallow-water zone (littoral and sublittoral) is an important source of the material accumulated in the profundal zone. The patterns and mechanisms of the course of contemporary sedimentation in Lake Gosciaz, as determined based on the conducted investigations, can be applied in the study of other lakes and in assessing the representativeness of sampling sites for laminated bottom sediments to be used in palaeo-environmental studies.					; Kramkowski, Mateusz/HGC-8797-2022; Bonk, Alicja/AAM-5328-2021; Brykała, Dariusz/L-2091-2017	Fojutowski, Michal/0000-0002-8171-355X; Bonk, Alicja/0000-0001-9863-9408; Gierszewski, Piotr, Jacek/0000-0001-5842-5157; Brykala, Dariusz/0000-0002-0105-4153; Blaszkiewicz, Miroslaw/0000-0003-4365-0938; Kramkowski, Mateusz/0000-0001-8025-7815													0211-6820	1697-9540					2021	47	2					391	413		10.18172/cig.4724	http://dx.doi.org/10.18172/cig.4724													WOS:000669421400006

Temporal variations in river-ice break-up over the Mackenzie River Basin, Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												For northern and arctic regions, the spring break-up period has important socio-economic, ecological and morphological effects. While these impacts are reasonably well understood, spatial and temporal assessments of break-up timing and duration remain limited due to the lack of readily available hydrometric data. For this study, the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) of Canada is selected as a test watershed in which the spatial and temporal aspects of observed (1913-2002) spring river-ice break-up are characterized. Data from 29 Water Survey of Canada gauging sites are used including the commonly assessed 'Last B date' (Last ice effect) and two hydrometric variables extracted directly from original water-Level. recording charts (the timing of initiation of break-up and peak water-level. during break-up). It is found that the extracted variables provide a more physically based quantitative description of the break-up season in the MRB compared to the 'Last B date' method. On average, the northwards progressing ice break-up season within the MRB Lasts similar to 8 weeks but historically has varied within a window representative of similar to 3 months of the year. The break-up period at specific locations varies from 4 days to 4 weeks. Results also indicate an anomalous zone of earlier spring break-up in the upper Peace and Athabasca region that may be partially related to the effects of flow regulation. In addition, the Mann-Kendall test reveals significantly earlier trends in the timing of spring break-up (similar to 1 day/decade) in upstream portions of the major tributaries of the MRB over the period 1970-2002. While similar trends have been found for other hydroclimatic variables in the basin, this study highlights the temporal patterns and variability of the spring break-up period in the Mackenzie River system.

SEASONAL AND SPATIAL CHANGES OF PLANKTONIC BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES INHABITING THE NATURAL THERMAL LAKE HEVIZ, HUNGARY	ACTA MICROBIOLOGICA ET IMMUNOLOGICA HUNGARICA												Lake Heviz is a unique thermal spa located in Hungary. Owing to the thermal springs nourishing the lake, it has a relatively rapid water turnover. In spring 2011 a comprehensive embankment reconstruction was performed to preserve the water supply of the surrounding wetland habitats. The physical and chemical parameters as well as the planktonic microbial communities were studied with special respect to the effect of the disturbance of the water of Lake Heviz. According to the abiotic components, both temporal and spatial differences were revealed with the exception of autumn samples. The reconstruction resulted in a short term but dramatic alteration of the total planktonic bacterial and cyanobacterial community structures as revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. In addition, greater seasonal than spatial differences of bacterial communities were also observed. Planktonic bacterial community composition of Lake Heviz included mainly typical freshwater species within phylum Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria and class Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria. Most of them were aerobic or facultative anaerobic heterotrophic but chemolitotrophic (e.g. Thiobacillus) or photolithotrophic (e.g. Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi) autotrophic microbes were also identified.

Charophytes of the two genera: Chara and Nitellopsis are quite efficient in this process. Some species of these macroalgae produce carbonate encrustations, mainly calcium carbonate, constituting up to 86% of the summer maximum dry weight of the standing crop. In this study, we analyzed the fate of inorganic carbon accumulated this way in Chara spp. and Nitellopsis obtusa from six Polish lakes located in two regions (warmer W Poland and cooler NE Poland). Our study distinguished two groups of charophyte species that differed in the way of CaCO3 release from their summer standing crops. On average, the corticate Chara rudis and C. tomentosa belonging to the first group were less efficient in depositing CaCO3 from summer to autumn than the less corticate C. contraria and ecorticate N. obtusa of the second group. The latter two species were more efficient in inorganic carbon burial in sediments. On the contrary, dissolution of encrustation was more typical of the first species group and was facilitated by decreasing the pH and saturation index of calcite in lake water. The final output of CaCO3 loss mainly resulted from combined species-specific features, lake water properties and overwintering patterns. Our study revealed that inorganic carbon cycling through charophytes involves burial and dissolution and is more complex than previously thought.					; Strzałek, Małgorzata/V-4270-2017; Brzozowski, Michał/AAB-2500-2022; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020; Pukacz, Andrzej/O-1936-2019; Woszczyk, Michał/AAK-2933-2021; Strzalek, Malgorzata/V-4270-2017; Pukacz, Andrzej/L-7757-2014	Kielczewski, Rafal/0000-0003-4900-3846; Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; Becher, Marcin/0000-0003-4996-1200; Brzozowski, Michal/0000-0002-8028-2129; Kowalewski, Grzegorz/0000-0001-9668-1071; Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; Kufel, Lech/0000-0002-9418-7878; Strzalek, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5472-7825; Pukacz, Andrzej/0000-0002-2395-1680													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2024	69	2					279	289		10.1002/lno.12479	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12479		DEC 2023											WOS:001126438700001

Indicator bacterial populations, physico-chemical properties, heavy metal contaminants and the presence of coliphages were determined according to standard protocols. The results showed that all sampling points failed to comply with the set guidelines for turbidity, total coliform, faecal coliform and total heterotrophic counts. Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Vibrio cholerae were also detected in all the water samples. The somatic coliphages and F-RNA coliphages were detected more frequently in the lower reaches of the river during summer.

J	Adrian, R; Wilhelm, S; Gerten, D				Adrian, R; Wilhelm, S; Gerten, D			Life-history traits of lake plankton species may govern their phenological response to climate warming	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												A prominent response of temperate aquatic ecosystems to climate warming is changes in phenology - advancements or delays in annually reoccurring events in an organism's life cycle. The exact seasonal timing of warming, in conjunction with species-specific life-history events such as emergence from resting stages, timing of spawning, generation times, or stage-specific prey requirements, may determine the nature of a species' response. We demonstrate that recent climate-induced shifts in the phenology of lake phytoplankton and zooplankton species in a temperate eutrophic lake (Muggelsee, Germany) differed according to differences in their characteristic life cycles. Fast-growing plankton in spring (diatoms, Daphnia) showed significant and synchronous forward movements by about 1 month, induced by concurrent earlier ice break-up dates (diatoms) and higher spring water temperature (Daphnia). No such synchrony was observed for slow-growing summer zooplankton species with longer and more complex life cycles (copepods, larvae of the mussel Dreissena polymorpha). Although coexisting, the summer plankton responded species specifically to seasonal warming trends, depending on whether the timing of warming matched their individual thermal requirements at decisive developmental stages such as emergence from diapause (copepods), or spawning (Dreissena). Others did not change their phenology significantly, but nevertheless, increased in abundances. We show that the detailed seasonal pattern of warming influences the response of phyto- and zooplankton species to climate change, and point to the diverse nature of responses for species exhibiting complex life-history traits.

Here, we hypothesized that besides modifying the rates of carbon utilization, temperature can also alter the diversity of substrates utilized. The patterns of utilization of 31 model DOM compounds (as represented in Biolog EcoPlates (TM)) by bacterioplankton were assessed using inocula from surface waters of the southern Bay of Biscay continental shelf over 1 year. Bacteria utilized more polymers and carbohydrates in late spring and summer than in winter, likely reflecting changes in substrate availability linked to the release and accumulation of DOM in phytoplankton post-bloom conditions. Seawater temperature correlated positively with the number of substrates utilized (i.e. functional richness) and this relationship was maintained in monthly experimental incubations spanning 3 degrees C below and above in situ values. The enhancement of functional richness with experimental warming displayed a unimodal response to ambient temperature, peaking at 16 degrees C. This temperature acted as a threshold separating nutrient-sufficient from nutrient-deficient conditions at the study site, suggesting that trophic conditions will be critical in the response of microbial DOM utilization to future warming.

J	Mhlanga, L; Mhlanga, W				Mhlanga, Lindah; Mhlanga, Wilson			Nitrate-induced changes and effect of varying total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio on the phytoplankton community in Lake Chivero, Zimbabwe: Microcosm experiments	WATER SA												Microcosm experiments were conducted to assess nitrate-induced changes and the effect of varying the ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus (TN:TP) on the winter and late summer phytoplankton communities in Lake Chivero, Zimbabwe. In both winter and summer, nitrate addition altered species composition from a cryptophyte-dominated to a chlorophyte-dominated assemblage and increased chlorophyll a concentration and total algal biomass. The shift in algal dominance and increase in chlorophyll a concentration and total algal biomass also occurred in the control showing that isolation from allogenic processes like turbulence had an effect on phytoplankton structure. Microcystis aeruginosa, a common cyanobacterium in Lake Chivero, did not assume dominance in any of the treatments. From an application perspective it is interesting that varying nitrate loadings in microcosms favoured chlorophytes rather than increasing undesirable cyanobacteria. Nutrient manipulation can be used as a management option to avoid cyanobacteria occurrence, by maintaining either cryptophytes or chlorophytes. However, the practicality of such an intervention needs to be assessed.																			0378-4738					JUL	2012	38	4					607	614		10.4314/wsa.v38i4.16	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v38i4.16													WOS:000308599000016

The objectives of this study were to determine (i) suitable forages based on yield and quality; and (ii) changes in feed value and yield of these crops through the late fall. Six legume cover crop mixtures, consisting mainly of chickling vetch (Lathyrus sativus L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.), and rape (Brassica napus L.), were planted at Dakota Lakes Research Farm after winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) harvest in 2010 and 2011 and were sampled at three fall dates, approximately 1 October, 1 November, and 1 December, to determine changes in yield and quality. Due to poor emergence of rape in 2010 all the mixtures had similar yields and quality values. Emergence of rape in 2011 decreased fiber and protein concentrations of the mixtures it was in. Yields for the mixtures ranged from 933 to 4590 kg ha(-1) over the two years, with yields increasing after the first harvest date both years. Crude protein concentrations ranged from 113 to 270 g kg(-1) for all treatments. All mixtures showed good forage potential, with some fiber supplementation needed in 2011 due to the high amounts of rape present in some mixtures.																			2374-3832					DEC	2015	1	1								10.2134/cftm2014.0013	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/cftm2014.0013													WOS:000453297900002

Yangzonghai Lake, a deep lake located in southwest China that was treated with flocculants after an accident resulted in As-contamination, was selected as a case study. We attempted to elucidate how As migrates and transforms in the lake based on water simulation experiments. The results were expected to facilitate evaluation of the suitability and safety of the technology when used in a natural water body. The results showed that the As that had already been precipitated into the sediment by FeCl3 would be released again into the water body due to the increasing activity of anaerobic microorganisms, thereby causing secondary pollution. This phenomenon was especially evident during summer because water temperature stratification reduced the dissolved oxygen (DO) at the sediment surface and led to anaerobic conditions, which enhanced the anaerobic activity at the bottom of the lake. In summer, the concentration of As in the water column increased with increasing depth. In contrast, during winter, the concentration of As was quite similar at all depths of the lake because the water temperature was uniform during this period. As was released from sediments to the aqueous phase in the form of trivalent As [As(III)] upon anaerobic incubation and was oxidized gradually into pentavalent As [As(V)], by the higher DO in the upper layers of the lake water. Contrary to expectation, the disturbance (turnover in the fall) did not increase, but rather decreased the As concentration in the lake, which might result in further coagulation and precipitation through intensive mixture of the unsaturated flocculants from the sediments.

Climate change effects on the thermal stratification of Lake Diefenbaker, a large multi-purpose reservoir	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Large multi-purpose reservoirs serve not only to generate hydropower but to supply water for agricultural irrigation, animal and human consumption and to provide flood control. One of the key factors affecting physical functioning and deteriorating aquatic ecosystems in reservoirs is climate change. For instance, increases in water temperature accelerate chemical reaction rates, decomposition rates and oxygen demand at the water-sediment interface. Earlier thermal stratification onset, and longer and more intense reservoir thermal stratification are all consequences of global warming. Such disruptions in thermal stratification have been associated with reductions in hypolimnion dissolved oxygen, increasing anoxia events and enhancing reservoir eutrophication. In this research paper, we implement the 2 D hydrodynamics and water quality model, CE-QUAL-W2, to investigate the effects of climate change and streamflow scenarios on the thermal structure of Lake Diefenbaker, a large, multipurpose reservoir, located in Saskatchewan, Canada. Model results indicate that meteorological variability will dictate a nonlinear increase in reservoir water temperature in the coming decades, where larger increases in water temperature will occur during summer and fall in the upper layers. Also, decreases in reservoir streamflows will reduce water temperature at intermediate layers during summer and fall. Our model can be used as a tool to mitigate and manage the effects of climate change on the reservoir water quality.

Impact of changing water levels and weather on Oncomelania hupensis hupensis populations, the snail host of Schistosoma japonicum, downstream of the Three Gorges Dam	ECOHEALTH												Increasing evidence indicates that dams impact riverine ecosystems and human diseases. Poyang Lake, one of the largest schistosomiasis endemic environments in China, will change due to the construction of the Yangtze River Three Gorges Dam. We assess changes in Oncomelania hupensis hupensis, the snail host for Schistosoma japonicum, in response to changing water levels and weather from 1998 to 2002. In the 5 years following the major flooding of Poyang Lake in 1998, seasonal water levels have gradually decreased, concomitant with decreases in mean and variance of fall snail densities. Nonlinear relationships suggest that the highest spring density is associated with current, 2-, and 3-month prior temperatures of 18 degrees, 9.1 degrees, and 5.8 degrees C, while the highest fall density is associated with 2- and 3-month prior water levels of 17 and 18 m, respectively. This suggests that lower, more stable water levels downstream of the dam may result in a reduction in mean fall densities and their variance. However, additional data are needed to determine whether snail populations that are typically destroyed by seasonal floods may live longer in more stable environments created by the dam.

J	Buerge, IJ; Buser, HR; Müller, MD; Poiger, T				Buerge, IJ; Buser, HR; Müller, MD; Poiger, T			Behavior of the polycyclic musks HHCB and AHTN in lakes, two potential anthropogenic markers for domestic wastewater in surface waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The synthetic polycyclic musks HHCB and AHTN are potential chemical markers for domestic wastewater contamination of surface waters. Understanding their environmental behavior is important to evaluate their suitability as markers. This study focuses on the quantification of the processes that lead to an elimination in lakes. Rate constants for all relevant processes were estimated based on laboratory studies and models previously described. In lake Zurich, during winter time, both compounds are eliminated primarily by outflowing water and due to losses to the atmosphere. In summer, direct photolysis represents the predominant elimination process for AHTN in the epilimnion of lake Zurich (quantum yield, 0.12), whereas for HHCB, photochemical degradation is still negligible. HHCB and AHTN were then measured in effluents of Swiss wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in remote and anthropogenically influenced Swiss surface waters, and in Mediterranean seawater using an analytical procedure based on SPE and GC-MS-SIM with D-6-HHCB as internal standard (LODs for natural waters, 2 and 1 ng/L, respectively). In winter, concentrations of HHCB and AHTN in lakes (<2-47 and <1-18 ng/L, respectively) correlated with the anthropogenic burden by domestic wastewater (ratio population per water throughflow), demonstrating the suitability of these compounds as quantitative, source-specific markers. In summer, however, no such correlations were observed. Vertical concentration profiles in lake Zurich indicated significant losses in the epilimnion during summer, mainly for AHTN, and could be rationalized with a lake modeling program (MASASlight), considering measured, average loads from WWTP effluents (0.80 +/- 0.22 and 0.32 +/- 0.11 mg person(-1) d(-1) for HHCB and AHTN, respectively) and the estimated rate constants for elimination processes.

Adsorption and microbial immobilization Of SO42- were studied in four northern hardwood stands that span an atmospheric deposition gradient in the Lake States region (5 to 10 kg S . ha-1 . year-1). Soil cores collected in spring, summer, and autumn were labeled with (SO42-)-S-35 to trace the flux of S between physical and biological sinks, and to investigate seasonal variation in sink strength. Intact soil cores were injected with (Na2SO4)-S-35 and incubated for 8 d in the laboratory at field temperature to study rates of adsorption and microbial immobilization. The amount of S-35 recovered within these pools was significantly different between surface and subsurface soil horizons. Microbial immobilization was the dominant S sink in the A+E horizon, whereas adsorption was the most important S sink in the B horizon. During the 8-d incubation, the proportion of S-35 that was immobilized in the A horizon (49% of applied S-35) was equivalent to the proportion of S-35 adsorbed in the B horizon (47% of applied S-35). Microbial immobilization sequestered an additional 25% of the applied S-35 in the B horizon. Adsorption and microbial immobilization were not significantly different among sampling dates. Sulfur retention in forested ecosystems should be viewed as a combination of geochemical and microbially mediated processes. However, given current levels of S deposition at these sites, neither process seems to represent a significant mechanism for long-term S retention.

The maximum rates of CH4 loss by ebullition occurred in late summer and were 35 mmol.cntdot.m-2 per day in 1972 and 37 in 1973. The average dissolved CH4 flux for 1972 was estimated to be in the range 10-46 mmol.cntdot.m-2 per day. The minimum value was estimated by summing dissolved CH4 concentrations in the water column for each sampling date. The maximum value was estimated using the Eddy diffusion coefficient of 4.9 .times. 10-3 cm2.cntdot.s-1, calculated from the temperature method of Hutchinson. This CH4 diffusion rate was about 2 times the average rate of CH4 lost by ebullition (21 mmol.cntdot.m-2 per day) over the same time period.

This assemblage is dominated by euryecious Nearctic and Holarctic orthocladine taxa (23 of 38 total species, total weighted relative abundance [WRA] = 0.972) and includes a minor Neotropical component. Chironomid species richness increases over distance downstream from the dam, and dominance shifts across 3 turbidity segments. Eleven species occur in the cold-stenothermic clearwater (CW) segment between the dam and the Ist perennial tributary (the Paria River, 26 km from the dam). Chironomid diversity increases from 18 to 24 species in the variably turbid (VT) and usually turbid (UT) segments downstream, respectively. Total Cricotopus spp. WRA is negatively correlated with distance (turbidity), while total Chironominae WRA shows the opposite pattern. In contrast to chironomid diversity, species density decreases from 0.42 species/km in the CW segment to 0.19 and 0.08 species/km in the VT and UT segments, respectively. Seasonal dominance shifts slightly from orthocladine Eukiefferiella spp, in winter (WRA = 0.101) to Cricotopus spp. (WRA = 0.165) in summer. Total WRA is lowest in spring (0.191).

It is shown that in recent years, there has been an increase of the average monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD) values in the summer months, which is consistent with an increase in smoke emission due to annual large-scale wildfires in the boreal forests of Siberia and Yakutia in summer. Aerosol classification was carried out based on filtration and selection of the prevailing types of aerosols by analysis of aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent. It was revealed that in summer, the proportion of the smoke component of the aerosol optical depth increases to 30% compared to the spring. In the presence of smoke advection, the close relationship of AOD with the concentrations of the microdispersed aerosol fraction PM10 and PM2.5 was revealed. The correlation coefficients between the concentration of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and AOD were 0.87 and 0.86, respectively.					; Zayakhanov, Alexander/HHS-3435-2022; Tsydypov, Vadim/V-1440-2018; Dementeva, Ayuna/ABF-8654-2021; Zhamsueva, Galina/HHS-3414-2022	Dementeva, Ayuna/0000-0002-1426-6817; Zhamsueva, Galina/0000-0003-3213-5252; Zayakhanov, Alexander/0000-0003-4112-2437; 														2073-4433				FEB	2022	13	2							211	10.3390/atmos13020211	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13020211													WOS:000765551200001

Hypoxia develops near the bottom in autumn in response to the temperature maximum that appears this time of the year. The decomposition rate of naturally present organic matter increases, creating higher biological oxygen demand. As the water column is stratified by salinity and temperature, mixing of seawater near the bottom with oxygen-supersaturated water which resides closer to the surface is very slow. When an extensive marine phytoplankton bloom appears below the halocline in the Proklian Lake, then, because of the sinking and degradation of phytoplankton near the bottom, the dissolved oxygen concentration decreases further. The hypoxia becomes so severe that it causes massive mortality of benthic macrofauna. The decomposition of the macrofauna further decreases the dissolved oxygen concentration. The hypoxia may persist until an increase in the freshwater inflow occurs, which forces the arrival of colder marine water near the bottom via a compensating flow. In the absence of autumn rains, the hypoxia may be recorded throughout winter.																			0304-4203	1872-7581				MAR	1991	32	2-4					347	359		10.1016/0304-4203(91)90048-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-4203(91)90048-2													WOS:A1991FF35600019

Lake-Related Cloud Dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau: Spatial Patterns and Interannual Variability	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The scarcity of meteorological observations has hitherto prevented spatially comprehensive and complete assessments on regional and local-scale atmospheric processes such as breeze systems on the Tibetan Plateau (TiP). Because of the high abundance of lakes, the steep topography, and the intense insolation of the TiP, lake breeze and land breeze systems might, however, contribute substantially to the local climatic and hydrological variability. The presented study aims at unveiling the influence of the lake effect over the whole TiP by using a novel high-mountain satellite cloud product, based on Meteosat Indian Ocean Data Coverage (IODC) data from 1999 to 2012, focusing on 70 lake systems larger than 72 km(2). Of particular interest are the spatial and interannual variability of lake-related cloud dynamics during boreal summer and autumn. For both seasons, a significant effect of lakes on cloudiness is shown during the early morning. Its mean strength is mainly determined by each basin's temperature difference between lake and surroundings. For boreal summer the large-scale influences of tropical and extratropical circulation pattern on the interannual variability of the lake effect are also investigated. The results show that the Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations (AO and NAO) inhibit convective activity above lakes in the northern and central-eastern domain. A positive polarity of the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), in contrast, is in phase with enhanced convective activity. The variability of the Indian summer monsoon circulation does not affect cloud dynamics at more than two locations. Case studies are employed to illustrate interactions between cloud activity and the SOI and NAO. For this purpose satellite data are combined with the modeled 10 km x 10 km High Asia Refined Analysis dataset on a daily basis.

J	Kritzberg, E; Bååth, E				Kritzberg, Emma; Baath, Erland			Seasonal variation in temperature sensitivity of bacterial growth in a temperate soil and lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Seasonal variation in temperature adaptation of growth was more pronounced for lake water then for soil bacterial communities. Faster bacterial biomass turnover is expected in water compared to soil, which would result in more rapid community adaption to changing environmental conditions, including temperature. Bacterial community adaptation for growth is therefore predicted to have larger seasonal amplitudes in lakes than in soil. To test this prediction, we compared the seasonal variation in temperature adaptation of bacterial community growth in a soil and lake in Southern Sweden (T-in situ 0-20 degrees C, mean 10 degrees C) during 1.5 years, based on monthly samplings including two winters and summers. An indicator of community adaptation, minimum temperature for growth (T-min), was calculated from bacterial growth measurements (Leu incorporation) using the Ratkowsky model. The seasonal variation in T-min (sinusoidal function, R-2 = 0.71) was most pronounced for the lake bacterial community, with an amplitude for T-min of 3.0 degrees C (-4.5 to -10.5 degrees C) compared to 0.6 degrees C (-7 to -8 degrees C) for the soil. Thus, T-min in water increased by 0.32 degrees C/degree change of T-in situ. Similar differences were also found when comparing four lakes and soils in the winter and summer (amplitudes 2.9 degrees C and 0.9 degrees C for lakes and soils, respectively). Thus, seasonal variation in temperature adaptation has to be taken into account in lakes, while for soils a constant T-min can be used.

Herein, the remote sensing data with resolution of 10-meter pixels and physics-based model were combined to explore spatiotemporal distribution of algae blooms in key tributaries of Three Gorges Reservoir, China. Self-organizing maps were used for identifying the drivers of blooms. The results revealed that algae blooms were more serious during dry years and there was little difference between dry or wet years for multi-stage gate river with coverage remaining at 42.90%. The open waters with slow currents were identified as high-risk zones. Hotspots of algae blooms changed during the year, which were close to estuary in spring, upstream in autumn, and dispersed in backwater region in summer. Water level was major measure for managing algae blooms, while meteorological conditions were identified as the key factor (40.25%) for river with multi-stage dams and characteristics of shallow lakes. For the nutrients-rich river, blooms were driven by both water level (13.98%) and climate factors (23.34%). The blooms of natural backwater river were stimulated by combination of water level, climate and waterhed nutrients. These results highlighted necessity of region water quality management in reservoir-impacted regions.					yu, jiaqi/GQO-8523-2022; Chen, Lei/AAD-3766-2019														0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2024	634								131058	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131058		MAR 2024											WOS:001219242700001

Characterization of the heterogeneous nature of sediments is vital for understanding of small-scale biogeochemical processes. However, there are limited reports on the related specialized methodology. In this study, the monthly distributions of labile phosphorus (P), a redox-sensitive limiting nutrient, were measured in the eutrophic Lake Taihu by Zr-oxide diffusive gradients in thin films (Zr-oxide DGT) on a two-dimensional (2D) submillimeter level. Geographical information system (GIS) techniques were used to visualize the labile P distribution at such a micro-scale, showing that the DGT-labile P was low in winter and high in summer. Spatial analysis methods, including semivariogram and Moran's I, were used to quantify the spatial variation of DGT-labile P. The distribution of DGT-labile P had clear submillimeter-scale spatial patterns with significant spatial autocorrelation during the whole year and displayed seasonal changes. High values of labile P with strong spatial variation were observed in summer, while low values of labile P with relatively uniform spatial patterns were detected in winter, demonstrating the strong influences of temperature on the mobility and spatial distribution of P in sediment profiles.

Tree-ring climate response of Jeffrey pine in the Cascade Creek Watershed, Northern California	JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE												Understanding the forest response to ongoing climate change is crucial in forest management strategies under anticipated climate adversity. To understand the retrospective growth dynamics of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.), tree-ring chronology from the subalpine forest in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California was correlated with air temperature, precipitation, and Palmar Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The years 1757, 1782, 1886, 1859, 1876, 1920, 1929-30, 1977, 1988-89, 2001-02, 2008, and 2014 were some of the years with noticeable low growth. There was robust growth in 1747-49, 1792, 1828, 1866-68, 1913, 1969, 1984, 1998, and 2011. Ring width index (RWI) and basal area increment showed a recent growth increase. Climate-growth response analysis revealed the growth-inhibiting influence of the hot and dry summer. More pronouncedly, warm and wet winter was found to be conducive to tree growth in the following year. A significant growth correlation with the previous year climate (stronger with PDSI) and its absence in current spring may be suggestive of potential growth stimulation by predicted warmer and longer growing season in the future. However, since the RWI chronology consisted mostly of mature trees and because the old cambial age tends to have signal divergence, further studies incorporating younger trees and cohabitant species would provide deeper insights into the growth-climate response.

J	Wentzky, VC; Tittel, J; Jäger, CG; Rinke, K				Wentzky, Valerie Carolin; Tittel, Joerg; Jaeger, Christoph Gerald; Rinke, Karsten			Mechanisms preventing a decrease in phytoplankton biomass after phosphorus reductions in a German drinking water reservoirresults from more than 50years of observation	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												To counteract the severe consequences of eutrophication on water quality and ecosystem health, nutrient inputs have been reduced in many lakes and reservoirs during the last decades. Contrary to expectations, in some lakes phytoplankton biomass did not decrease in response to oligotrophication (nutrient reduction). The underlying mechanisms preventing a decrease in biomass in these lakes are the subject of ongoing discussion. We used a hitherto unpublished long-term data set ranging from 1961 until 2016 from a German drinking water reservoir (Rappbode Reservoir) to investigate the underlying mechanisms preventing a decrease in biomass. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the Rappbode Reservoir dropped abruptly in 1990 from 0.163 to 0.027mg/L within three consecutive years, as a result of banning phosphate-containing detergents. Despite substantial reductions in TP, total annual phytoplankton biomass did not decline in the long-run, and therefore, the yield of total phytoplankton biomass per unit phosphorus largely increased. Regression analysis revealed a positive association between the yield and potentially phagotrophic mixotrophs (R-2=.465, p<.001). We infer that by ingesting bacteria, mixotrophic species were capable of exploiting additional P sources that are not accessible to obligate autotrophic phytoplankton, eventually preventing a decrease in algal biomass after TP reductions. Long-term epilimnetic phosphorus concentrations during the winter mixing period decreased to a greater degree than summer phosphorus concentrations. Apparently, TP losses over the season were less intense. Spring diatom biomass also markedly decreased after oligotrophication. In fact, spring diatom biomass was positively related to the TP loss over the season suggesting diatoms play an important role in P reduction. However, this intraannual P processing was not the primary factor when focusing on the average yearly yield, which remained to be fully explained by mixotrophs. Our study demonstrates this ecosystem's ability to compensate for changes in resource availability through changes in phytoplankton community composition and functional strategies. We conclude that an increase in mixotrophy and the ability to make bacterial phosphorus available for phytoplankters were the main factors that allowed the phytoplankton community of the Rappbode Reservoir to adapt to lower nutrient levels without a loss in total biomass.

Responses of phytoplankton upon exposure to a mixture of acid mine drainage and high levels of nutrient pollution in Lake Loskop, South Africa	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The relationships between water quality and the phytoplankton community within Lake Loskop were studied during the late summer and autumn of 2008 to evaluate the impacts of acid mine drainage and high nutrient concentrations. The higher concentrations of metal ions and sulphate had adverse effects on certain phytoplankton species in the inflowing riverine zone of Lake Loskop, in comparison to the reference site in the lacustrine zone of the lake, which was dominated by the larger and slower growing late summer species of Coelastrum reticulum Nageli, Straurastrum anatinum Meyen ex Ralfs and Ceratium hirundinella Muller. The high nutrient concentrations (nitrogen: 17 mg l(-1) and orthophosphate: 0.7 mg l(-1)) during the mid-summer peak of the rainy season were associated with the development of a bloom of the cyanobacterium Microcystis. Water quality data associated with the development of the Microcystis bloom suggest that the aquatic system of Lake Loskop has now entered an alternate, hypertrophic regime. This change overshadowed the adverse effects of high concentrations of heavy metal ions and low pH. Throughout this study, the reference site in the lacustrine zone of Lake Loskop had lower concentrations of metal ions and sulphate, and higher pH values. The response of phytoplankton bioassays on integrated water samples from the different sampling sites did provide potential answers to the reasons for the absence of the algal group Chlorophyceae in the phytoplankton community structure in the riverine zone of the lake.

The yield of phytoplankton both as chlorophyll and in cell numbers of major species was determined after a two-week incubation. During these experiment, some of the algae present initially never multiplied (e.g. Peridinium and Peridiniopsis spp. Cryptomonas spp., Rhodomonas spp. and Crysochromulina parva; others e.g. Anomoeoneis exilis, Synedra sp., Chlamydomonas sp., Elakatothrix gelatinosa), undetected in the original sample, grew out during the incubation. Chlorophyte species (the majority of commonly observed forms in the lake) responded most readily to added nutrients. The results of these enrichment experiments were related to the long-term record of phytoplankton popluations observed in the lake and suggest that through summer and fall, when ambient levels of both P and N are minimal, P was generally, but not always, the most limiting nutrient for algal growth. In the spring, after the decline of the Peridinium bloom, P appeared to be limiting the growth of Chlorophyta. Although most algal species grew equally well on NH4 or NO3, some species appeared to respond preferentially either to the former (Coelastrum, Chodatella) or to the latter (Chroococcus, Anomoeoneis) source of N.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 9	1988	166	1					65	75		10.1007/BF00017484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017484													WOS:A1988Q015000002
J	Naselli-Flores, L; Barone, R				Naselli-Flores, L; Barone, R			Water-level fluctuations in Mediterranean reservoirs: setting a dewatering threshold as a management tool to improve water quality	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Water-level fluctuations, often linked to seasonal climatic trends, are a natural phenomenon which occur in almost all aquatic ecosystems. In some climatic regions, as the Mediterranean one, they are particularly wide due to the occurrence of two well separated periods: the rainy winter and the almost completely dry summer. Precipitation is concentrated in the first period, whereas in the second strong evaporation losses take place. According to these climatic features, and to ensure a continuous supply of water throughout the year, man-made lakes store water during winter and are subjected to dewatering during summer to compensate the lack of precipitation. These ecosystems are thus characterised by rather wide water level fluctuations which were observed to transform them from potentially warm monomictic lakes into polymictic or atelomictic ones. These changes deeply affect the biological structure and the functions of the water bodies impairing the response of some ecosystem properties, as resilience and resistance, since the impacts are immense enough to move the systems out of their homeostatic plateau of, respectively, deep or shallow lakes. In order to understand to what extent a reservoir can be "emptied" without changing its ecosystemic identity (deep or shallow lake sensu Padisak & Reynolds, 2003) and to set a "dewatering threshold", the results from two different hydrological years, one with a dewatering so intense as to disrupt thermal stratification in midsummer, and the other one with water enough to allow the maintenance of the reservoir's thermal structure throughout the summer, are compared. Former investigations have shown that the persistence of thermal stratification has a positive value in Sicilian reservoirs: a notable decrease in total phytoplankton biomass and in the relative occurrence of cyanoprokaryotes was observed in the high-level year with a stable thermal stratification. Although the solving of the external load problems causing eutrophication phenomena remain the main task to improve the water quality of this Mediterranean island, a management procedure, based on the maintaining of the ecosystem within its homeostatic plateau through the setting of a dewatering threshold, is suggested.					; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008	BARONE, Rossella/0000-0001-5777-0688; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 1	2005	548						85	99		10.1007/s10750-005-1149-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1149-6													WOS:000232760900009
J	EDGAR, NB; GREEN, JD				EDGAR, NB; GREEN, JD			CALANOID COPEPOD GRAZING ON PHYTOPLANKTON - SEASONAL EXPERIMENTS ON NATURAL COMMUNITIES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Calanoid copepods are major components of most lacustrine ecosystems and their grazing activities may influence both phytoplankton biomass and species composition. To assess this we conducted four seasonal, in situ, grazing experiments in eutrophic Lake Rotomanuka, New Zealand. Ambient concentrations of late stage copepodites and adults of calanoid copepods (predominantly Calamoecia lucasi, but with small numbers of Boeckella delicata) were allowed to feed for nine days on natural phytoplankton assemblages suspended in the lake within 1160 litre polyethylene enclosures. The copepods reduced the total phytoplankton biomass of the dominant species in all experiments but were most effective in summer (the time of highest grazer biomass) followed by spring and autumn. In response to grazing pressure the density of individual algal species showed either no change or a decline. There were no taxa which increased in density in the presence of the copepods. The calanoid copepods suppressed the smallest phytoplankton species (especially those with GALD (Greatest Axial Linear Dimension) < 25 mum) and there appeared to be no selection of algae on the basis of biovolume. Algal taxa which showed strong declines in abundance in the presence of the copepods include Cyclotella stelligera, Coelastrum spp., Trachelomonas spp., Cryptomonas spp., and Mallomonas akrokomos. Calanoid copepods are considered important grazers of phytoplankton biomass in this lake. The study supports the view that high phytoplankton: zooplankton biomass ratios and large average algal sizes characteristic of New Zealand lake plankton may, at least partly, be caused by year round grazing pressure on small algae shifting the competitive balance in favour of larger algal species.

Phyto-pigment composition in a GBR World Heritage Area affected by Fitzroy outflow	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												This research reports on the phyto-pigment composition (by High Performance Liquid Chromatography) within the southern Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area at the end of a 15-year dry spell, and then during and after an intervening flood event. The study period covers the wet season of 2007-08 and involves four main estuaries of the Capricorn Coast, namely Corio Bay, Ross Creek, the Causeway Lake and Cawarral Creek. These flow into the southern Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) and are situated about 20-60 km north of where the Fitzroy River estuary meets the sea in north eastern Australia. The four estuaries were sampled on three occasions, during the study period, while one estuary was sampled continuously on a fortnightly basis for water quality and phyto-pigment concentrations. Phytopigment concentrations indicated the relative presence of different phytoplankton functional groups such as diatoms (fucoxanthin), cyanobacteria (zeaxanthin) and green flagellates (chlorophyll b). Trends in phytoplankton assemblages were analysed using multivariate analyses, including the relationship between phyto-pigment composition and water quality. Overall, cyanobacteria were dominant in spring and summer before large river outflows stimulated diatoms, and green flagellates followed in the cooler and lower-nitrogen waters of autumn. We propose that large Fitzroy River outflows have profound biogeochemical importance for the Capricorn Coast and can cause significant phytoplankton shifts in this world heritage area. Moreover, this study provides a valuable contribution towards understanding the presence/absence of phytoplankton functional groups with extreme climate conditions in this southern GBRWHA region.

Responses of Zooplankton Populations to Four Decades of Climate Warming in Lakes of Southwestern Alaska	ECOSYSTEMS												Zooplankton support a variety of important ecosystem processes in lakes but our understanding of how these organisms respond to ongoing climate change is superficial. Aquatic ecosystems have been exposed to substantial climate warming in the last century, and this trend is certain to continue, especially in northern latitudes. We analyzed a long time series of a variety of physical attributes of Lake Aleknagik, southwest Alaska, to quantify warming trends between 1963 and 2009, and to assess zooplankton community responses to variation in thermal conditions. Our analyses demonstrate clear trends toward earlier spring ice break-up, increases in average epilimnetic temperatures and an 18.5% increase in summer epilimnetic degree days since 1963. We estimated the magnitude and direction of changes in zooplankton production and end of season densities in response to changes in thermal environment, then explored whether the climate-driven responses in production are common in five large lakes that are distributed across a coastal-interior landscape gradient. Although we detected no clear directional changes in zooplankton densities or production rates, there were clear correlations between these variables and interannual variation in thermal conditions. The positive effects of earlier spring ice break-up and increase in summer degree days were strongest on the production and density responses of Daphnia and Bosmina, and the lagged effect of temperature was important and negative only for calanoid copepods. There was a negative effect of sockeye escapement to Lake Aleknagik in the previous year on all taxa. There were lake-specific effects of changes in the thermal environment on almost all taxa and small gradients in the magnitude of responses across the landscape, but no systematic patterns of landscape control.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				SEP	2012	15	6					1010	1026		10.1007/s10021-012-9560-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-012-9560-0													WOS:000307763700012

The eutrophication status of the bay was assessed using the eutrophication index (EI), nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio (N/P), and single-factor pollution index (SFPI). The results indicate a rising trend in DIN concentrations, while DIP levels are declining, leading to an N/P ratio far exceeding the Redfield ratio of 16:1, suggesting a persistent nitrogen surplus in Bohai Bay. Eutrophication levels were found to be higher in spring and summer, with EI values peaking at 3.593 in spring 2024 and 4.705 in summer 2021. Additionally, coastal regions exhibited significantly higher eutrophication levels than the central bay. A strong negative correlation between DO and DIN suggests that nitrogen-driven eutrophication has intensified hypoxia. These findings highlight the combined impacts of human activities and climate change on nutrient dynamics and underscore the need for a balanced approach to nitrogen pollution control and ecosystem response management in the future.

J	Jukema, J; Piersma, T				Jukema, J; Piersma, T			Occurrence of Pacific Golden Plovers in The Netherlands; Historical perspectives from the "Wilsternetters"	WATERBIRDS												The present wintering range of the Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva) includes the northeastern Lip of Africa, southern Asia, to Australia and New Zealand and much of the Pacific Ocean. We summarize evidence from the oral history of "Wilsternetters" (artisanal hunters using air ancient, specialized netting device to capture grassland-shorebirds in daytime), as well as written records, to suggest that, Until quite recently the wintering range of the Pacific Golden Plover may even have included the southern North Sea coast, mainly in the north of The Netherlands. Near the Zuiderzee (a large Dutch estuary, that was closed off front the sea in 1932 and is now known as Lake Ijsselmeer). the birds came inland to roost during spring tides, often in the company of Dunlin (Calidris alpina). However, Pacific Golden Plover were usually captured much further inland after the onset of severe winter weather, apparently after the birds had started moving away from their normal coastal winter habitat. Uniquely, Pacific Golden Plover wintering so far west and north appeared to show adaptations to cold (a thick and rather downy plumage) and unpredictable feeding conditions (a large fat store in midwinter). These special life-history features may have made it a distinct subspecies. Whether Dutch engineering, i.e. the loss of the Zuiderzee, played a role in their disappearance is probably beyond investigation. Received 17 October 2001, accepted 21 November 2001.

Assuming a water surface, Fresnel reflection is used to compute the albedo of the surface in order to estimate the net heating and hence potential lake evaporation. The long-term monthly variation in the surface radiation budget is then compared with measurements by recently installed automatic weather stations, one on the north coast and another in the Messara Valley in the south. As expected, over monthly timescales the surface radiation budget does not differ appreciably between the two locations and good agreement is found between the predictions of the models and the measured fluxes. An estimate of the monthly variation of potential evaporation is obtained and it is shown that a water surface in the Valley undergoes relatively large variations in potential evaporation, from 2 mm per day during its typically Mediterranean wet winter to 7 mm per day during its dry summer. A simple first estimate of the Valley's actual evapotranspiration gives about 2 mm per day average during the wet winter months and about 2-3 mm per day during the dry summer months for drip-irrigated olive groves, where water supply is limited by the pumping of the available groundwater.

Sonic transmitters equipped with a pressure sensor were surgically implanted in 12 adult fish (295-345 mm FL). Three automatic receivers recorded a total of 61 335 data points on swimming depth between 26 November 1998 and 7 November 1999. Brown bullheads swam in water from 0 to 17 m deep but showed some seasonal variations. They were more active at night when they used shallow water extensively, especially during the winter months. They were most mobile in spring when they left Motuoapa Bay, suggesting migratory behaviour. During winter the fish remained more stationary, only moving around inside the bay. The results of this study provide guidance for establishing a brown bullhead control program should it become necessary.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2002	483	1-3					129	135		10.1023/A:1021319310063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021319310063													WOS:000179639600015
J	HEIKKINEN, K				HEIKKINEN, K			ORGANIC-MATTER, IRON AND NUTRIENT TRANSPORT AND NATURE OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER IN THE DRAINAGE-BASIN OF A BOREAL HUMIC RIVER IN NORTHERN FINLAND	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT					International Conference on Organic Substances in Soil and Water	SEP 14-17, 1992	LANCASTER, ENGLAND					Organic carbon and iron transport into the Gulf of Bothnia and the seasonal changes in the nature of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were studied in 1983 and 1984 at the mouth of the River Kiiminkijoki, which crosses an area of minerotrophic mires in northern Finland. Organic and inorganic transport within the drainage basin was studied in the summer and autumn of 1985 and 1986, and information was also acquired on the nature of DOM by gel filtration in river, brook and peat mining water. The river water is organically coloured, with high organic matter, Fe concentrations and transport rates, while the values for phosphorus and nitrogen are low. The organic carbon concentrations increase with discharge with the major organic load restricted to the time of spring floods. The results indicate that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is mainly of terrestrial origin, leaching mostly from peatlands. Autochthonous DOC sources seem also to be important in summer. The DOC concentrations decrease under low flow conditions probably mainly due to sedimentation and decomposition of humic substances. The proportion of drifting algae as a particulate organic carbon (POC) source seems to increase in summer. The changes in the ratio of Fe/DOC, the colour of the DOM and the ratio of fluorescence to DOC with discharge give indications of the origin, formation, nature and fate of the DOM in the river water. Temperature-dependent microbiological processes in the formation and sedimentation of Fe-organic colloids seem to be important. Estimates are given for the amounts and transport rates of organic carbon and Fe discharged into the Gulf of Bothnia by river. High apparent molecular weight (HAMW) organic colloids are important for the organic, Fe and P transport in the basin. The gel filtration data suggest that the DOM in the water consists mainly of fulvic acids, although humic acids are also important. The apparent molecular weight of the DOM is higher than in the lakes in the area of ombrotrophic peatlands in southern Finland. Colour in this humic water increases with DOC and Fe concentrations. The results indicate an increase in the mobilization of HAMW Fe-organic colloids in the peatlands following drainage and peat mining. The transport of inorganic nitrogen from the peatlands in the area and in the river is increasing due to peat mining. The corresponding changes in the transport of organic matter, Fe and P are less marked but point in a similar direction.																			0048-9697					JUL 25	1994	152	1					81	89		10.1016/0048-9697(94)90553-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(94)90553-3													WOS:A1994NX45200010

Lakes as buffers of stream dissolved organic matter (DOM) variability: Temporal patterns of DOM characteristics in mountain stream-lake systems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												[1] Lakes within fluvial networks may affect dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in streams by dampening spring DOM snowmelt flushing responses and/or by increasing summer DOM production. We assessed the temporal variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM characteristics (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)); DOC: dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC: DON)), as well as DOC export in seven paired lake inflows and outflows in the Sawtooth Mountain lake district, Idaho. We hypothesized that lakes would decrease stream DOM temporal variability and increase DOM export as a result of autotrophic production. We correlated DOM variability with landscape factors to evaluate potential drivers of DOM temporal patterns (measured as coefficient of variation). Coefficients of variation were 40-90% higher in lake inflows than outflows for DOC concentrations, characteristics, and DOC: DON. Increases in DOC concentrations on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph were greater in lake inflows than outflows, and on average mean DOC flux occurred 5.4 days earlier in the inflows than for the outflows. During base flow, mean outflow DOC concentrations were 1.7 times greater than inflows, and six outflows had higher annual export than inflows. Combined, these results illustrate that lakes alter the magnitude, timing and temporal variation of DOM concentration and characteristics exported from subalpine watersheds. This buffering effect results from a seasonal shift in the balance between hydrological versus biological controls on DOC dynamics, where lakes act as a sink during the spring when hydrologic controls dominate watershed DOM transport and act as a DOM source during summer.					; Wurtsbaugh, Wayne/G-6856-2011; Baker, Michelle/F-3434-2010	Baker, Michelle/0000-0002-7188-8639; Goodman, Keli/0000-0001-7121-2017													2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV 29	2011	116								G00N02	10.1029/2011JG001709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JG001709													WOS:000297655000002
J	Riedel, GF; Sanders, JG				Riedel, GF; Sanders, JG			The interrelationships among trace element cycling, nutrient loading, and system complexity in estuaries: A mesocosm study	ESTUARIES												Biogeochemical interactions between a suite of trace elements and nutrients were examined in a series of experimental mesocosm experiments to understand how multiple stressors affect estuarine environments and how these effects are modified by the complexity of the system used to examine them. Experimental treatment included additions of nutrients and trace elements separately and combined, along with a gradient in experimental system complexity. Eight mesocosm experiments were carried out from 1996 through 1998. Increased nutrients generally decreased dissolved trace element concentrations, in large part through an increase in phytoplankton biomass, but also by increasing the concentration of metals in the particles. Trace element additions increased dissolved nutrients by decreasing phytoplankton biomass. The presence of sediments reduced both dissolved trace element and nutrient concentrations. Other complexity treatments had weaker effects on both dissolved nutrients and trace elements. Many of the observed effects appeared to be seasonal, occurring only in spring, or their magnitude was greater in spring. This may be linked to a change from phosphorus to nitrogen limitation that often occurs in the Patuxent River estuary in the late spring or early summer period.																			0160-8347					APR	2003	26	2A					339	351		10.1007/BF02695972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02695972													WOS:000184052600014

However, given the complex climatic regulation of vegetation growth, the main climatic controls on arboreal vegetation in the eastern TP still need to be explored. In this study, a 387.5 cm sediment core covering the last 12.6 cal ka was recovered from Emu Co on the eastern TP. Based on pollen analysis in conjunction with the modern analogue technique, the role of various climate factors influencing past vegetation changes was modelled. Our results show that, during 12.6-9.5 cal ka BP, the study area experienced an arid and cold climate, with a sparse vegetation cover, as evidenced by the high abundance of herbaceous pollen and low total pollen concentration. A cold-tolerant deciduous broadleaved arboreal component, dominated by Betula, began to expand at ca. 9.5 cal ka BP, replacing herbaceous vegetation habitat, suggesting a gradual warming and wetting trend. Controlled mainly by rising temperatures, evergreen coniferous tree components develop from 8.7 to 5 cal ka BP, with Picea pollen reaching its maximum abundance. After 5 cal ka BP, the herbaceous vegetation reexpands under the combined pressure of lower temperatures and reduced precipitation. Declining arboreal pollen abundance in the mid-to-late Holocene is prevalent in the available fossil pollen records, but the main drivers have regional peculiarities: in the east-central region of the TP near Emu Co, lower temperatures may have played a more important role in the retreat of trees than reduced precipitation. Conversely, arboreal retreat and vegetation change in the north-east and south-east regions may be related to the weakening of the Asian summer monsoon circulation and seasonal climate changes caused by the East Asian winter monsoon and Indian summer monsoon, respectively.

J	Gassama, N; Cocirta, C; Kasper, HU				Gassama, Nathalie; Cocirta, Constantin; Kasper, Haino Uwe			Use of major and selected trace elements to describe mixing processes in a water reservoir	COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE												Data on temperature, major constituents and some trace elements, measured in the dissolved and particulate phases, were used to identify the hydrodynamics of a reservoir (the Bicaz reservoir, Romania). Results revealed that the reservoir experiences two thermal stratifications per year (summer and winter). However, the summer stratification is delayed by the high river inflow of June July. Two layers were identified, a surface and a deep layer, whose location and impact vary with time. The surface layer originates from the river inflow (intrusion layer) and the deep current is produced by the outflow (velocity current). According to season, the river inflow either supplies the deep current or remains recordable up to the dam. Consequently, the structure of the water column, and thus the biogeochemical processes within it, are governed both by thermal stratification and by these layers. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences.

However, the functions of anammox in freshwater river systems remain uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the occurrence of anammox activity in two rivers in the Taihu Lake region in China during a seasonal survey. Homogenized sediments were incubated with 15N-labeled NO and NF11,- amendments to determine the potential importance of the anammox process relative to canonical denitrification. Production of N-29(2) and N-30(2) in slurries was determined using membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Potential anammox rates in the two river sediments ranged from 0.11(+/-)0.07 to 6.79 +/- 1.28 nmol N 111-211-1 and the remove of N by anammox accounted for 0.8 0.00% to 10.7 +/- 0.03% of total N2 production. Potential anammox rates varied spatially and temporally in the two rivers, with the highest and lowest mean anammox rates appearing during summer and early autumn and during winter, respectively. The variation of the percentage of anammox to total N-2 production displayed the same trend with potential anammox rates. Water temperature and NO content in sediments were the main factors affecting anammox activity. Anammox bacteria were detected in sediment samples using barcode pyrosequencing. The S-16 rRNA anammox gene sequences in the river sediments were affiliated with Candidatus Kuenenia, Candidatus Jettenia, and Candidatus Scalindua, among which C Kuenenia dominated the anammox bacterial communities. Our results confirmed the presence of anammox bacteria but their role is relatively small in removing fixed N from freshwater river systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study provides the first comprehensive fatty acid dataset for important prey and predator species in Lake Ontario. Three major prey fish (alewife, rainbow smelt, and round goby) were collected at three sites along the southern shore of Lake Ontario during the spring and fall of 2013, and predator species were collected in similar locations during the summer of 2013. Fatty acid compositions were compared among all prey species, all predator species, and information from both predator and prey was used to infer foraging differences among predators. Seasonal differences in fatty acids were found within each prey species studied. Differences among prey species were greater than any spatio-temporal differences detected within species. Fatty acids of predators revealed species-specific differences that matched known foraging habits. Chinook and Coho salmon, which are known to select alewife as their dominant prey item, had relatively little variation in fatty acid profiles. Conversely, brown trout, lake trout, yellow perch and esocids had highly variable fatty acid profiles and likely highly variable diet compositions. In general, our data suggested three dominant foraging patterns: 1) diet composed of nearly exclusively alewife for Chinook and Coho Salmon; 2) a mixed diet of alewife and round goby for brown and lake trout, and both rock and smallmouth bass; 3) a diet that is likely comprised of forage fishes other than those included in our study for northern pike and chain pickerel.

Lessons from Inter-Comparison of Decadal Climate Simulations and Observations for the Midwest US and Great Lakes Region	ATMOSPHERE												Even with advances in climate modeling, meteorological impact assessment remains elusive, and decision-makers are forced to operate with potentially malinformed predictions. In this article, we investigate the dependence of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulated precipitation and temperature at 12- and 4-km horizontal resolutions and compare it with 32-km NARR data and 1/16th-degree gridded observations for the Midwest U.S. and Great Lakes region from 1991 to 2000. We used daily climatology, inter-annual variability, percentile, and dry days as metrics for inter-comparison for precipitation. We also calculated the summer and winter daily seasonal minimum, maximum, and average temperature to delineate the temperature trends. Results showed that NARR data is a useful precipitation product for mean warm season and summer climatological studies, but performs extremely poorly for winter and cold seasons for this region. WRF model simulations at 12- and 4-km horizontal resolutions were able to capture the lake-effect precipitation successfully when driven by observed lake surface temperatures. Simulations at 4-km showed negative bias in capturing precipitation without convective parameterization but captured the number of dry days and 99(th) percentile precipitation extremes well. Overall, our study cautions against hastily pushing for increasingly higher resolution in climate studies, and highlights the need for the careful selection of large-scale boundary forcing data.

Iodate and iodide concentrations were determined by differential pulse voltammetry and cathodic stripping square wave voltammetry, respectively. In addition, total iodine concentrations were determined by ICP-MS in May. The hydrographic and nutrient profiles indicate that the system was greatly affected by photosynthesis and demonstrate strong seasonal change in predominant phytoplankton assemblages. The hypolimnion depths were dominated by regeneration processes and benthic influence, with anoxic and sulphidic conditions at maximum sampling depth in July. The iodine profiles show no clear direct relationship between the iodine and nutrient system regarding to the phytoplankton production. Meanwhile, the results demonstrate temporal matching between high iodate and high regenerated nitrate concentrations in the surface layers, and close spatial matching of iodate production and nitrification at mid-depths of hypolimnion. The key role of nitrifers is discussed and the implication of these findings is explored. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal patterns in carbon dioxide in 15 mid-continent (USA) reservoirs	INLAND WATERS												Evidence suggests that lakes are important sites for atmospheric CO2 exchange and so play a substantial role in the global carbon budget. Previous research has 2 weaknesses: (1) most data have been collected only during the open-water or summer seasons, and (2) data are concentrated principally on natural lakes in northern latitudes. Here, we report on the full annual cycle of atmospheric CO2 exchanges of 15 oligotrophic to eutrophic reservoirs in the Glacial Till Plains of the United States. With one exception, these reservoirs showed an overall loss of CO2 during the year, with most values within the lower range reported for temperate lakes. There was a strong cross-system seasonal pattern: an average of 70% of total annual CO2 efflux occurred by the end of spring mixis; some 20% of annual flux was reabsorbed during summer stratification; and the remaining 50% of efflux was lost during autumnal mixing. Net annual flux was negatively correlated with depth and positively correlated with both water residence time and DOC, with the smallest annual CO2 efflux measured in shallow fertile impoundments.

Simulating Climate Change Impacts on Surface Water Resources Within a Lake-Affected Region Using Regional Climate Projections	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study aims to assess the impact of climate change on water resources in a large watershed within the Laurentian Great Lakes region, using the fully integrated surface-subsurface model HydroGeoSphere. The hydrologic model is forced with an ensemble of high-resolution climate projections from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The latter has been extended with an interactive lake model (FLake) to capture the effect of the Great Lakes on the regional climate. The WRF ensemble encompasses two different moist physics configurations at resolutions of 90, 30, and 10km, as well as four different initial and boundary conditions, so as to control for natural climate variability. The integrated hydrologic model is run with a representative seasonal cycle, which effectively controls natural climate variability, while remaining computationally tractable with a large integrated model. However, the range of natural variability is also investigated, as are the impacts of climate model resolution and bias correction. The two WRF configurations show opposite climate change responses in summer precipitation, but similar responses otherwise. The hydrologic simulations generally follow the climate forcing; however, due to the memory of the subsurface, the differences in summer propagate throughout the entire seasonal cycle. This results in a set of dry scenarios with reduced streamflow and water availability year-round and a set of wet scenarios with increased streamflow for all times excluding the spring peak, which does not increase. Most of the analysis focuses on streamflow, but changes in the seasonal cycle of baseflow and groundwater recharge are also analyzed. Plain Language Summary In this study we investigate the impact of climate change on water resources using state-of-the-art computer simulations. The simulations were conducted using physically based models, which simulate the circulation of the atmosphere, rainfall, and the flow of water above and below the surface. The region of interest here is the Grand River Watershed, located in the Great Lakes region (southern Ontario, Canada). We show that with high resolution and a physical representation of the Great Lakes, only a simple correctionmuch less than for global climate modelsis necessary, in order to simulate a realistic climate. We find that predicted climate change impacts on water resources depend strongly on some approximations commonly made to represent thunderstorms and precipitation in climate models. The most likely scenario, based on our analysis, is an increase in precipitation and streamflow in all seasons except spring, but some scenarios also show less precipitation in summer, which results in lower streamflow year-round. A major result is that differences in summer precipitation can affect streamflow in all seasons, but only if the interaction with groundwater is properly accounted for. At the moment uncertainty in future summer precipitation changes limits our ability to predict impacts on water resources.

J	MARKOSOVA, R; JEZEK, J				MARKOSOVA, R; JEZEK, J			INDICATOR BACTERIA AND LIMNOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN FISH PONDS	WATER RESEARCH												The populations of indicator bacteria (mesophilic, coliform and fecal streptococci) together with relevant limnological parameters (temperature, oxygen, BOD and chlorophyll-a) were recorded during a 6 year study of three eutrophic ponds. Ecosystems were manipulated with fish (Cyprinus carpio) in 2-year management cycles: in spring of the first year, the pond was stocked with young fish, and in the fall of the second year it was drained and mature fish were harvested. Fish management had a direct influence on bacterial numbers and on the basic parameters of the systems. A statistical analysis using t-tests found significant differences in oxygen concentration, chlorophyll-a and BOD during both years of fish management. A water temperature model was calculated on an extensive homogenous data set (197 measurements), by fitting a regression curve. During each season, populations of indicator bacteria increased with increasing water temperature, and maximal numbers of bacteria were recorded during the summer months. Correlation analysis (fitted Spearman correlation coefficient) confirmed that temperature had a positive significant effect on population dynamics. The results demonstrate that fish stocking can affect bacterial population, in the sense that during high fish biomass (second years) the numbers of indicator bacteria as well as BOD and phytoplankton were higher. If pond water quality must be optimised for the purposes of drinking or recreation, the planned fish yield may have to be reduced.

J	Thomson, LI; Copland, L				Thomson, Laura I.; Copland, Luke			Changing contribution of peak velocity events to annual velocities following a multi-decadal slowdown at White Glacier	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												As the focus of intensive glaciological studies in the 1960-70s, White Glacier on Axel Heiberg Island, Canada, has played an important role in understanding the dynamics of mostly-cold polythermal glaciers in the high Arctic. In this study, we examine the magnitude, duration and timing of peak velocity events in the summers of 2013-15 using continuous dual-frequency GPS observations, and compare them with similar measurements made in 1968. Summer speed-up events in 1968 and 2014, in which ice velocities reached 200% above winter values, were found to occur in conjunction with formation and drainage of an ice-marginal lake. Despite thinning of the glacier by >20 m and a decrease in annual surface velocities of 15-35% since the 1960s, the relative magnitude and duration of these peak events has increased, particularly at lower elevations, in comparison with the observations at the same locations many decades ago. Given the long-term slowdown of the glacier, the relative contribution of summer displacement to the net annual motion has therefore increased significantly, with summer motion over the span of <2 months now accounting for nearly half of the total annual displacement.																			0260-3055	1727-5644				JUL	2017	58	75	2				145	154		10.1017/aog.2017.46	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aog.2017.46													WOS:000425012900007

We conducted photochemical experiments and used mathematical models based on pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics to quantify the photochemical transformations of individual N species and their seasonal effects on N cycling in a mountain forest stream and lake (Plesne Lake, Czech Republic). Results from laboratory experiments on photochemical changes in N speciation were compared to measured lake N budgets. Concentrations of organic nitrogen (N-org; 40-58 mu mol L-1) decreased from 3 to 26% during 48-hour laboratory irradiation (an equivalent of 4-5 days of natural solar insolation) due to photochemical mineralization to ammonium (NH4+) and other N forms (N-x; possibly N oxides and N-2). In addition to N-org mineralization, N-x also originated from photochemical nitrate (NO3-) reduction. Laboratory exposure of a first-order forest stream water samples showed a high amount of seasonality, with the maximum rates of N-org mineralization and NH4+ production in winter and spring, and the maximum NO3- reduction occurring in summer. These photochemical changes could have an ecologically significant effect on NH4+ concentrations in streams (doubling their terrestrial fluxes from soils) and on concentrations of dissolved N-org in the lake. In contrast, photochemical reactions reduced NO3- fluxes by a negligible (<1%) amount and had a negligible effect on the aquatic cycle of this N form.

Reservoirs in the temperate zone react most sensitively to climate warming during winter as ice cover and inversed stratification are about to disappear in a warmer world. In this study, two well-established hydrodynamic models, the one-dimensional General Lake Model (GLM) and the two-dimensional CE-QUAL-W2 (W2), were used to investigate the response of winter inversed stratification in the Rappbode Reservoir to future climate warming, combined with different water withdrawal elevations.ResultsUnder increased air temperature, the duration of inversed stratification is reduced and the inversion phenomenon will entirely disappear under current management if the air temperature is increased high enough (more than 4.5K) in the future. Under strong climate warming, the Rappbode Reservoir will therefore change from a dimictic to a monomictic mixing type. Changing the reservoir management from deep withdrawal (e.g., below 350m a.s.l.) to shallow withdrawal elevations (e.g., above 390m a.s.l.) reduces internal heat energy stored in the reservoir in summer and prolongs the inversed stratification period in winter. This strategy can retain the dimictic behavior even under strong warming.ConclusionsOur study indicates that adjusting the withdrawal elevation is an effective management instrument to control the winter conditions and can, in fact, mitigate climate warming effects on winter hydrodynamics by stabilizing the dimictic mixing type.

Seasonal diet shifts and trophic position of an invasive cyprinid, the rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus, 1758), in the upper Niagara River	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Dietary shifts of invasive rudds Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus, 1758) and food web structure of the upper Niagara River were examined. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) of liver tissue was used to test the hypothesis that rudds shifted their diets from piscivory during early spring months when macrophyte availability was low towards herbivory when macrophytes were abundant and warmer water temperatures facilitated digestion. Muscle tissue was used to evaluate the trophic position of rudds and other invasive species relative to native species. SIA revealed enriched delta N-15 and depleted delta C-13 in liver tissue of rudds during early spring months, suggesting a mostly piscivorous diet of pelagic origin when macrophyte availability was low, and depressed delta N-15 and elevated delta C-13 values during warmer summer months when littoral macrophytes were abundant. Analysis of muscle tissue from late summer indicated that rudds and other invasive fishes, including common carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) and goldfish Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758), had similar trophic positions that may be attributed to their omnivorous feeding strategies. The ability of rudds to shift their diets from feeding on fishes of pelagic origin towards consuming littoral macrophytes is an adaptation that is likely to both facilitate invasion and create novel pathways of nutrient transfer among habitat types. Our results provide an increased understanding of the feeding ecology of the rudd and the role of this invasive species in the food web of the upper Niagara River.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				MAR	2015	10	2					217	225		10.3391/ai.2015.10.2.10	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2015.10.2.10													WOS:000353300900010

Previous studies suggest that the predominant mercury methylation zone moves to the water column during periods of stratification and that high potential methylation rates (Km) in sediment require oxygenated overlying water. However, simultaneous measurements of methylmercury (MeHg) produc-tion in both the sediment and water column remain limited. Understanding the relative importance of sediment versus water column methylation and the impact of seasonal stratification on these processes has important implications for managing MeHg production. This study measured Km and potential demethylation rates (Kdm) using stable isotope tracers of unfiltered inorganic mercury and MeHg in sediments and water of the littoral and profundal zones of a shallow branch of the Nacimiento Reservoir in California's central coastal range. Field sampling was conducted once during winter (well-mixed/oxygenated conditions) and once during late summer (thermally stratified/anoxic conditions). The results showed very high ambient MeHg concentrations in hypo-limnetic waters (up to 7.5 ng L-1; 79% MeHg/total Hg). During late summer, littoral sediments had higher Km (0.024 day -1) compared to profundal sediments (0.013 day -1). Anoxic water column Km were of similar magnitude to Km in the sediment (0.03 day -1). Following turnover, profundal sediment Km did not change significantly, but water column Km became insignificant. Summer and winter sediment Kdm were higher in profundal (2.35, 3.54 day -1, respectively) compared to the littoral sediments (0.52, 2.56 day -1, respectively). When modelled, Km in the water column could account for approximately 40% of the hypolimnetic MeHg. Our modelling results show that the remaining MeHg in the hypolimnion could originate from the profundal sedi-ment. While further study is needed, these results suggest that addressing methylation in the water column and profundal sediment are of equal importance to any remediation strategy.					; Luxton, todd/AAA-7671-2020; Millard, Geoffrey/AAH-6793-2020	Eckley, Chris/0000-0002-6986-4451; Luxton, Todd/0000-0003-1774-5407; Millard, Geoffrey/0000-0003-3310-4837; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				JAN 1	2023	316		1						120485	10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120485		NOV 2022						36279994					WOS:000904879300007

Trophic differences between the two species throughout the two sampling periods were related to the environmental trophic condition (i.e. nutrient and phytopigment concentrations). Although these two fish have different habitats, they both exploited benthic organisms, above all in summer. When the nutrient and phytopigment concentrations were higher (summer), the most abundant benthic organisms were the main food sources for both species. In winter A. boyeri apparently shifted its feeding preferences to include zooplankton, confirming its opportunistic feeding strategy. Par-ticulate organic matter and algae seemed to play the main trophic role in the food web structure. Benthic invertebrates used both sources, while zooplankton seemed to rely exclusively on the particulate fraction. The overlapping and very depleted signatures of sedimentary and particulate organic matter highlights a strong link between sediments and water column, rarely observed in other aquatic ecosystems using stable isotopes. Such a finding further substantiates the importance of particulate organic matter as a food source in the study area.

However, in the 1990s, phytoplankton biomass increased again, almost reaching the high values recorded during the period of greatest P loading. The structural changes in the phytoplankton of Lake Geneva over the past 25 yr have been analyzed using a recently developed statistical method based on hierarchical clustering and Bayesian probabilities. This method has been used to identify phytoplankton assemblages and to map annual and interannual successional patterns simultaneously. Characteristic species were identified for each cluster after calculation of their relative species fidelity and specificity indices. Six distinct phytoplankton assemblages were identified, and although the way species are organized into communities remains unclear, the seasonal patterns of succession are consistent with the C-S-R adaptive strategies and are characteristic of temperate lakes. This pattern broadly recurred over the years, but was markedly influenced by both human activity and regional climatic changes: The warmer winters and springs recorded in Europe since 1988 led to an earlier clear-water phase. In the 1990s, the earlier and deeper depletion of dissolved inorganic phosphorus led to colonization in the summer by large species tolerant of low light levels and that could develop deeper in the water column, where phosphorus was still abundant. Their size made them less vulnerable to grazing losses, which favors their accumulation and lead to an unexpected high biomass in recent years.					; Souissi, Sami/C-5146-2018	Souissi, Sami/0000-0002-6720-0096; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2002	47	5					1355	1366		10.4319/lo.2002.47.5.1355	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2002.47.5.1355													WOS:000178081800008

Assessment of backwater lake management strategies based on the diets of five riverine fishes	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Swan Lake, an Illinois River backwater, has been affected by sedimentation, altered hydrological patterns, and aquatic vegetation loss. This degradation led to a habitat rehabilitation and enhancement project where the lower portion of the lake was divided into two management units, with varying connectivity to the river and frequency of lake drawdowns to compact sediments. We assessed effects of these strategies on fish habitat by analyzing the diets of five riverine fishes in 2005 and 2006. Even though habitat improvement was in its early stages, diet analysis suggested that the frequent drawdowns of the middle unit created a better fish foraging habitat. During the summer, common carp and orangespotted sunfish consumed more prey items in the middle unit where frequent drawdowns occurred relative to the lower unit where only one drawdown was conducted. Additionally, caloric intake by common carp was greater in the middle unit during both summer and winter and for crappie during the winter. The single drawdown of the lower unit did not result in the desired sediment consolidation, which likely contributed to the poor foraging habitat.

J	HALL, DJ; WERNER, EE				HALL, DJ; WERNER, EE			SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF FISHES IN LITTORAL ZONE OF A MICHIGAN LAKE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The seasonal distributions and abundances of 15 littoral zone fish species [Micropterus salmoides, Pomoxis nigromaculatus, Lepomis macrochirus, L. gibbosus, L. gulosus, L. cyanellus, L. megalolis peltastes, Perca flavescens, Notemigonus crysoleucas, Notropis heterodon, N. heterolepis, Erimyzon sucetta, Esox lucius, E. americanus vermiculatus, Amia calva] were determined from May-Oct. 1976 in a small Michigan lake. A team of divers performed 7 censuses along a set of transects which encompassed nearly the entire littoral region of the lake; additional dives enabled us to determine vertical distributions and migration patterns to and from overwintering areas. All species appeared to show less habitat segregation in spring when temperatures rose and food was abundant. Species distributions and abundances were quite constant during the summer and considerable habitat segregation was apparent. The bluegill (L. macrochirus) was the dominant species and was studied in greater detail. Small bluegills (< 80 mm total length) were confined throughout the year to the vegetation apparently to avoid predation; larger fish moved up in the water column. This species overwintered in 2 localized regions of tall perennial vegetation in the deep littoral apparently in response to predation and food availability. As the water warmed to 20.degree. C, the aggregations dispersed around the entire lake; this movement was reversed in autumn. These abundances and distribution patterns appear to be stable from year to year. This is probably due to the largely perennial vegetation structure and dependable resources in this marl lake. Temperature appears to set the overall bounds to the movements and habitats utilized, but ecological interactions are probably responsible for the finer resolution of microhabitat utilization among size classes and species in the littoral zone.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1977	106	6					545	555		10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<545:SDAAOF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106<545:SDAAOF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1977EF41500004

METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												A detailed analysis of 2 years' hourly microclimatic (mainly surface air temperature) data recently acquired from locations widely dispersed over 700 km2 in the Abisko catchment encompassing Lake Tornetrask in Swedish Lapland is presented in this study. This project is designed to explore the effects of microclimatic variability, past and future climate change (1913-2100) on regional vegetation and land-use changes, at an unique Arctic ecological and climate monitoring site, to aid adaptation of stakeholders to future climate change. Dominant altitudinal lapse rate and radiation effects during summer are revealed in detailed analysis of spatial variations in temperature between the different sites, which become largely negated during winter when cold-air ponding is much more significant. Moreover, near-shore temperatures are moderated significantly by Lake Tornetrask during the spring lake-ice melt season. The extent to which synoptic meteorological conditions affect these factors is explored. Examples of gridded temperature maps for the Abisko region are also presented, produced using a downscaling model based on the temperature data, which have numerous ecological and other applications. The long-term Abisko Scientific Research Station meteorological record, which spans almost a century from 1913 to present is also explored, for evidence of climate change, to set the temperature logger data in a long-term climate context. Exploratory analysis of the possible influence of future regional climate change on ecological/vegetation zones is also briefly discussed.

Clear spatial-temporal shifts in the SRB community structure were observed. Results implied existence of distinct SRB populations between the water column and sediment, as well as higher diversity of the SRB occupying water layer then the ones found in the sediment. Likewise, seasonal variations in populations were observed. While SRB community was more diverse in the winter compared to the summer season in the water layer, situation was opposite in the sediment. Water layer communities seem to be more susceptible to changes of physico-chemical parameters, while those in the sediment have prorogated response to these changes. Results indicate that SRB diversity is still highly underestimated in natural environments, especially in specific habitats such as Rogoznica Lake. Presented data show a complex SRB diversity and distribution supporting the idea that habitat -specific SRB communities are important part of the anaerobic food chain in degradation of organic matter as well as cycling of sulfur and carbon species in the Lake and similar anoxic environment.

Analyzing spatial-temporal change of multivariate drought risk based on Bayesian copula: Application to the Balkhash Lake basin	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												In the past century, drought events were likely to be frequent and severe in the arid areas under climate change impact. In this study, a Bayesian copula multivariate analysis (BCMA) method is developed for assessing the impact of spatial-temporal variation on drought risk, through coupling Bayesian copula with multivariate analysis. BCMA can reveal the dynamic characteristics of droughts and deal with the uncertainty caused by copula parameters when modeling the dependent structures of variable pairs (duration-severity-affected area). BCMA is applied to the Balkhash Lake basin in Central Asia for assessing multivariate drought risk during 1901-2020. Some major findings can be summarized: (1) in 1901-2020, the basin suffered 53 droughts; the most severe drought occurred from October 1973 to January 1977 (39 months), and 95% of the basin was affected (335,800 km(2)); (2) droughts usually develop in the direction of "east-west," and Ili River delta and alluvial plain are the most frequent areas (47.2%) in the basin; (3) droughts show significant seasonality and frequently occur in spring and summer (64.2%), and drought risks of the middle and lower reaches of Ili River are the highest in spring and summer; (4) multivariate characteristics significantly affect drought risk, and drought risk ranges from 1.9 to 18.1% when the guarantee rate is 0.99; (5) the possible causes of drought risk dynamics are meteorological factors (e.g., precipitation and evapotranspiration) and underlying surface factors (e.g., runoff and soil moisture). The findings suggest that droughts in the Balkhash Lake basin are affected by climatic factors, and BCMA can provide methodological support for the studies of drought in other arid regions.					; Li, Yongping/AAF-3298-2019; Huang, Guohe/H-5306-2011; Huang, Guohe (Gordon)/H-5306-2011	Yang, Xin/0000-0002-7781-0269; Huang, Guohe (Gordon)/0000-0003-4974-3019													0177-798X	1434-4483				JUL	2022	149	1-2					787	804		10.1007/s00704-022-04062-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-04062-z		MAY 2022											WOS:000795526500001
J	MOONEY, EP				MOONEY, EP			A STUDY OF LOUGH CORRIB, WESTERN IRELAND AND ITS PHYTOPLANKTON	HYDROBIOLOGIA												During 1980/1981, a twelve month study was carried out on the phytoplankton of Lough Corrib, a large freshwater lake in western Ireland. Cell counts indicated low phytoplankton productivity and this was reflected in low chlorophyll a values and high Secchi readings. Diatoms predominated in spring and were succeeded by blue-green algae in late summer. The spring diatom crop was apparently limited by either silicate or nitrogen. Mineral uptake by rooting macrophytes and benthic algae and phosphate recycling as a result of bottom sediment disturbance may be important elements in the nutrient cycling regime of the lake. Differences in morphology between the upper and lower basins of the lake are reflected, to some extent, in species composition and areal productivity.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 15	1989	175	3					195	212		10.1007/BF00006090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006090													WOS:A1989AA21800003
B	Landolt, E		Kelcey, JG; Muller, N		Landolt, Elias			Zurich	PLANTS AND HABITATS OF EUROPEAN CITIES												Zurich, which is the largest city in Switzerland, is situated to the north of the Alps and at the northern end of Lake Zurich in an area with a rather cool sub-oceanic climate. More than 1,400 indigenous or naturalised species of higher plants have been recorded in the city, of which almost 200 (mainly archaeophytes) have become extinct within the last 160 years. The extinctions were caused by habitat loss resulting from the intensification of agricultural production and residential and other forms of development. On the other hand 300 new species have been able to colonize and become established in the city. The reasons for this being general climatic warming and the "heat-island effect" that is a characteristic of the urban environment. The previously relatively cool summers prevented many species from achieving their life cycle, which the recent warmer temperatures now allow them to. Also the milder winters enable many species to survive in the city, over winter, particularly in sheltered places. The absence of really cold winters for more than 20 years has enabled some sub-tropical plants to survive throughout the winter and even set fruit and regenerate from seeds, for example, the palm Trachycarpus fortunei.																					978-0-387-89683-0				2011							547	577				10.1007/978-0-387-89684-7												WOS:000292617400017

The feed sources are becoming scarce and, as a result, the fish are consuming their adipose tissue accumulated during the warm season, becoming prone to disease due to weight loss. The research was carried out during 2018, 2019 and 2020 years at the Fish Culture Research and Development Station, Nucet. The fish wintering was done in ponds, in two experimental versions: Variant 1 - no feed was administered and Variant 2 - live food was administered (fish species without economic importance). The experiments for each variant were performed in three densities, as follows: 200 kg/basin (2000 kg/ha), 500 kg/basin (5000 kg/ha) and 700 kg/basin (7000 kg/ha). The best results for survival rate were obtained in variant 2 in 2020 at 200 kg/basin density, with a 98.8% survival rate. The weight gain rate in variant 2 for 2018 at 500 kg/basin density, obtained a growth rate of 137 kg/wintering season.

Six individuals were tagged with satellite transmitters at Zhuanghe, Liaoning Province, northeastern China, in July of 2017 and 2018 to identify important distribution sites during the breeding period and detailed migration routes. The results showed that Zhuanghe Bay, Qingduizi Bay and Dayang Estuary were important feeding and roosting sites for black-faced spoonbills from August to October. Jiaozhou Bay, Shandong Province, and Lianyungang and Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, were important stopover sites during fall migration, and the coastal areas of Yancheng, Jiangsu; Hangzhou Bay, Zhejiang Province; and Tainan, Taiwan of China; and the inland areas of Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, and Nanyi Lake, Anhui Province, were important wintering sites. This is the first study to report the inland migration routes of black-faced spoonbills in China. Our findings on the key breeding distribution sites, fall migration routes and current threats (such as aquaculture, mudflat reclamation and dam construction) have important implications for the conservation of and global action plan development for the endangered black-faced spoonbill.

Radar quantifies migrant concentration and Dawn reorientation at a Great Lakes shoreline	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Background: Millions of flying migrants encounter the Great Lakes and other large water bodies on long-distance flights each spring and fall, but quantitative data regarding how they traverse these obstacles are limited. Shorelines are known areas of migrant concentration due to the ecological barrier effect, but details on the magnitude of this concentration and the flight behaviors causing it are largely unknown and difficult to quantify. Mobile avian radar can provide a unique view of how birds and bats move across landscapes by tracking thousands of individual migrants moving through a sample volume that extends multiple kilometers in radius. Results: During the spring of 2014 we used two avian radar units to compare migration patterns at shoreline (1.5 km from the shore) and inland (20 km from the shore) sites along the eastern shoreline of Lake Michigan in the north-central US. We found shoreline activity to be 27% greater than inland activity over all time periods, and 132% greater during the hour surrounding dawn. An analysis of flight directions found that migrants flew to the north and northwest during dusk and night, with many heading out over the lake, but shifted direction towards the east at dawn, as those flying over water reoriented towards land. This shift in direction, which was most intense at the shoreline, may contribute to the higher concentrations of migrants observed at shorelines in this study and others. Conclusions: These findings help confirm and quantify the phenomenon of nocturnal migrant reorientation at dawn, and also stress the functional importance of coastal regions for aerial migrants. The high use of coasts by migrants highlights the importance of conserving shoreline stopover habitat, which often competes with anthropogenic uses. We suggest using a high degree of caution when assessing potential impacts from development in these sensitive environments, and encourage protection of these high-use areas.																			2051-3933					AUG 29	2018	6								15	10.1186/s40462-018-0135-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-018-0135-3								30181878					WOS:000445836700001

Within-winter shifts in Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus distribution at East Dongting Lake, China	ARDEA												At the important wintering site, East Dongting Lake in the Yangtze River flood-plain, Lesser White-fronted Geese Anser erythropus showed within-season shifts in distribution and abundance between local areas. On arrival in November, over 4,000 geese grazed high-biomass stands of new growth spikerush Eleocharis migoana on exposed mud flats at Caisang Lake. High feeding densities depleted Eleocharis by early December, when the geese departed to feed on old-growth above-ground Carex heterolepis at nearby lakes. Cool, arid conditions inhibited plant growth until January, when the grass Alopecurus aequalis and C. heterolepis restarted growing, attracting geese back to Caisang Lake. Greater numbers returned in late February when E. migoana began to grow, rapidly building to peak at 4,500 in late March when geese began spring migration. Habitat management that maintains these patterns of plant growth and availability may be critical to keeping present Lesser White-fronted Goose numbers at this site.					; Fox, Anthony/I-7465-2013	Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303; 													0373-2266	2213-1175				SPR	2012	100	1					5	11		10.5253/078.100.0103	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/078.100.0103													WOS:000304507100003

A new method is described for sampling the drift in large rivers continuously and automatically, using equipment based on the marine, continuous plankton sampler of Hardy (1936). 2. Between April and November 1989, about 790h were sampled continuously, equivalent to a water volume of 2937 m3 and the total catch was 527 drifting macroinvertebrates, in forty-nine taxa. Twenty-five of these taxa are recorded in the drift for the first time and twenty-eight of the drifting taxa were present in benthos samples from the Danube. 3. Total drift density varied between 12 and 31 animals per 100 m3 of water sampled throughout the year, with a maximum of 31 animals in May. The composition of major faunal groups showed a significant seasonal pattern, with Oligochaeta and Diptera predominant in spring, Crustacea and Insecta in summer and only Crustacea in autumn. The overall density of the macrozoobenthos from October 1986 to December 1987 was about 19 360 animals m-2 and the proportion of total benthos animals, drifting at any instant in time, ranged from 0.0026 to 0.0064%. 4. The relationship between drift density day-1 and mean daily discharge was described by a power-function. Total mean drift rate of macroinvertebrates in the Danube was estimated to be 13 600 000 animals per 24h and the mean drift distance was estimated to vary between about 4 and 31 m, dependent on the animal group and the water velocity. 5. No obvious consistent diel pattern could be established from the continuous samples, and no marked diel rhythm could be detected for Oligochaeta, Diptera larvae and Crustacea.																			0046-5070					JUN	1991	25	3					461	476		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01389.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01389.x													WOS:A1991FW54500006

Increases in wintertime PM2.5 sodium and chloride linked to snowfall and road salt application	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The application of salts and salty brines to roads is common practice during the winter in many urban environments. Road salts can become aerosolized, thereby injecting sodium and chloride particulate matter (PM) into the atmosphere. Here, data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency Chemical Speciation Monitoring Network were used to assess temporal trends of sodium and chloride PM2.5 (PM < 2.5 gm) at 25 locations across the United States to investigate the ubiquity of road salt aerosols. Sodium and chloride PM2.5 concentrations were an average of three times higher in the winter, as compared to the summer, for locations with greater than 25 cm of average annual snowfall. Winter urban chloride PM2.5 concentrations attributed to road salt can even sometimes rival those of coastal sea spray aerosol-influenced sites. In most snow-influenced cities, chloride and sodium PM2.5 concentrations were positively correlated with snowfall; however, this relationship is complicated by differences in state and local winter maintenance practices. This study highlights the ubiquity of road salt aerosols in the United States and their potential impact on wintertime urban air quality, particularly due to the potential for multiphase reactions to liberate chlorine from the particle-phase. Since road salt application is a common practice in wintertime urban environments across the world, it is imperative that road salt application emissions, currently not included in inventories, and its impacts be investigated through measurements and modeling.					; Peterson, Peter/J-4224-2019; Pratt, Kerri/F-8025-2010	Peterson, Peter/0000-0002-9337-6677; Pratt, Kerri/0000-0003-4707-2290; May, Nathaniel William/0000-0002-8913-4827													1352-2310	1873-2844				MAR	2018	177						195	202		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.01.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.01.008													WOS:000428095500019

Moisture evolution in North Xinjiang (northwest China) during the last 8000 years linked to the westerlies' winter half-year precipitation	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Winter half-year precipitation dominates variations in hydroclimatic conditions in North Xinjiang, but few researchers have focused on this very important aspect of the Holocene climate. Here we report multiproxy evidence of Holocene hydroclimate changes from the sediments of Wulungu Lake in North Xinjiang. The site is a closed terminal lake fed mainly by meltwater from snow and ice, and today the area is climatically dominated by the westerlies. Grain-size end-member analysis implies an important mode of variation that indicates a gradually increasing moisture trend, with superimposed centennial-scale variations, since 8000 cal yr BP. From 8000 to 5350 cal yr BP, a permanent lake developed, and the lake level gradually rose. Between 5350 and 500 cal yr BP, the moisture status increased rapidly, with the wettest climate occurring between 3200 and 500 cal yr BP. After 500 cal yr BP, the lake level fell. The trend of increasing Holocene wetness indicates a rising winter precipitation in North Xinjiang during the Holocene. This was due to an increase in upwind vapor concentrations caused by increased evaporation and strength of the westerlies, which were determined by the increasing boreal winter insolation and its latitudinal gradient.					; Huang, Zhendong/ABF-4713-2021; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013; Zhang, Xiao-Nan/AAL-3286-2021	Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; Huang, Zhendong/0000-0002-2107-7897; An, Cheng-Bang/0000-0002-4443-0518; 													0033-5894	1096-0287				MAR	2021	100						122	134	PII S0033589420000940	10.1017/qua.2020.94	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2020.94													WOS:000631176000007

Composition and photo-reactivity of organic matter from permafrost soils and surface waters in interior Alaska	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Yedoma permafrost soils are especially susceptible to abrupt thaw due to their exceptional thickness and high ice content. Compared to other mineral soils, yedoma has a high organic carbon content, which has shown to be particularly biolabile. The organic carbon in these deposits needs to be characterised to provide an identification toolkit for detecting and monitoring the thaw, mobilisation and mineralisation of yedoma permafrost. This study characterised organic carbon isolates from thermokarst lakes (either receiving inputs from thaw of original yedoma or refrozen-thermokarst deposits, or lacking recent thaw) during winter and summer seasons within the Goldstream Creek watershed, a discontinuous permafrost watershed in interior Alaska, to identify the extent to which thermokarst-lake environments are impacted by degradation of yedoma permafrost. Waters from lakes of varied age and thermokarst activity, as well as active layer and undisturbed yedoma permafrost soils were isolated and characterised by functional group abundance (multiCP-MAS(13)C and SPR-W5-WATERGATE(1)H NMR), absorbance and fluorescence, and photobleaching ability. DOM isolated from winter and summer seasons revealed differing composition and photoreactivity, suggesting varied active layer and permafrost influence under differing ground water flow regimes. Water extractable organic matter isolates from permafrost leachates revealed variation in terms of photoreactivity and photolability, with the youngest sampled permafrost isolate being the most photoreactive and photolabile. As temperatures increase, release of permafrost organic matter is inevitable. Obtaining a holistic understanding of DOM composition and photoreactivity will allow for a better prediction of permafrost thaw impacts in the coming decades.

J	Santana, LM; Nabout, JC; Ferragut, C				Santana, Lucineide Maria; Nabout, Joao Carlos; Ferragut, Carla			Taxonomic and functional classifications of phytoplankton in tropical reservoirs with different trophic states	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Ecological approaches, such as functional groups (sensu Reynolds, FG) and exclusively morphological-based groups (sensu Kruk, MBFG), have provided a reliable tool for understanding phytoplankton responses to environmental conditions. Our study evaluated the concordance and the response of these two-functional classifications of the phytoplankton community to environmental variables in reservoirs of different trophic states (ultra-oligotrophic to meso-eutrophic). We also investigated the spatial and temporal concordance of the functional classifications with the taxonomic-based classification (species). Integrated water samples were collected in the euphotic zone in two climatic periods (summer and winter) to determine physical and chemical variables and phytoplankton. Higher water temperature and thermal stratification were observed in the summer, whereas higher free CO2 concentrations and mixing regime of water column in the winter. The 35 descriptors species showed a greater relationship to the trophic conditions of the reservoirs. The functional classifications revealed that the 17 FGs and 7 MBFGs were influenced primarily by seasonal variation of limnological conditions (water temperature, CO2 concentration, Zmix depth) and secondarily by trophic state of the reservoirs. Stronger similarity (higher than 0.70) was verified between species and FGs matrices (Mantel test, mainly) than between species and MBFGs ones. Procrustes and Mantel tests also evidenced high concordance between FGs and MBFGs matrices, exhibiting similar spatial and temporal distribution to environmental conditions. Thus, these ecological classifications demonstrated to be complementary tools, besides their particular degrees of detailing, to elucidate the functional responses of numerous phytoplankton species in studied tropical reservoirs.

We used band recovery data and isotopic composition of primary (P1) and secondary (S13) feathers to estimate population sources and connectivity among natal, early fall, and winter ranges of hunter-harvested juvenile American woodcock. We used P1 feathers from known-origin pre-fledged woodcock (n = 43) to create a hydrogen delta H-2(f) isoscape by regressing delta H-2(f) against expected growing-season precipitation (d2Hp). Modeled delta H-2(p) values explained 79% of the variance in P1 delta H-2(f) values, indicating good model fit for estimating woodcock natal origins. However, a poor relationship (r(2) = 0.23) between known-origin, S13 delta H-2(f) values, and expected delta H-2(p) values precluded assignment of early fall origins. We applied the delta H-2(f) isoscape to assign natal origins using P1 feathers from 494 hunter-harvested juvenile woodcock in the United States and Canada during 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 hunting seasons. Overall, 64% of all woodcock origins were assigned to the northernmost (>44 degrees N) portion of both the Central and Eastern Management Regions. In the Eastern Region, assignments were more uniformly distributed along the Atlantic coast, whereas in the Central Region, most woodcock were assigned to origins within and north of the Great Lakes region. We compared our origin assignments to spatial coverage of the annual American woodcock Singing Ground Survey (SGS) and evaluated whether the survey effectively encompasses the entire breeding range. When we removed the inadequately surveyed Softwood shield Bird Conservation Region (BCR) from the northern portion of the SGS area, only 48% of juvenile woodcock originated in areas currently surveyed by the SGS. Of the individuals assigned to the northernmost portions of the breeding range, several were harvested in the southern extent of the wintering range. Based upon this latitudinal winter stratification, we examined whether woodcock employed a leapfrog migration strategy. Using delta H-2(f) values and band-recovery data, we found some support for this migration strategy hypothesis but not as a singular explanation. The large harvest derivation of individuals from the northernmost portions of the breeding range, and the difference in breeding distributions within each Management Region should be considered in future range-wide conservation and harvest management planning for American woodcock.

J	Sethi, SA; Benolkin, E				Sethi, Suresh A.; Benolkin, Elizabeth			Detection efficiency and habitat use to inform inventory and monitoring efforts: juvenile coho salmon in the Knik River basin, Alaska	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Imperfect detection associated with sampling gear presents challenges for wildlife inventory and monitoring efforts. We examined occupancy dynamics and habitat use of juvenile coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, in shallow lake environments over a summer and early fall season in the Knik River area of south central Alaska using models which control for and estimate sampling gear detection efficiency. In addition, we present statements for the probability that observed absences at a survey site or from a survey area (a collection of sites) are true absences given some amount of sampling effort and analysts' beliefs about site occupancy and sampling gear detection efficiency which can be used to guide inventory and monitoring efforts for juvenile salmon or other wildlife and plant species. Occupancy modelling results demonstrate that minnow traps were effective at sampling juvenile coho in shallow lake environments, with a mean probability of detection across the study period of 0.68 (i.e., probability of detecting the presence of juvenile coho given that they are present at a trap site; SE=0.03). Juvenile coho salmon migrated into shallow water lakes in late summer and early fall, presumably to seek out overwinter habitat. N-mixture modelling examination of habitat use demonstrated that once in shallow lake environments, juvenile coho were widely distributed across a range of microhabitats, with some evidence for preference for shallower depths and warmer water temperatures.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2013	22	3					398	411		10.1111/eff.12034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12034													WOS:000319872900006

Climatic models anticipate a decrease of total discharge, a marked decrease of summer discharge, an increase in winter discharge, and a decrease in ice and snow cover, inducing a change in the river flow regime. However, the high level of economic development in the entire watershed has triggered complex impacts on river and lake hydrosystems. These already registered changes foreshadow predicted changes and provide insights into the future of aquatic ecosystems that will suffer the impacts of warmer temperatures. An attempt was made to summarize the possible impacts on the future uses of water. Hydro and thermal power will be affected by changes in hydrological regime and reduction in the cooling capacity of the Rh ne River. Also, tourism will experience a reduction of snow cover in winter; agriculture, a reduction of water availability in summer; human health will face threats of new kinds of parasites; and last, the level of flood risks may increase in valley bottoms following deposition of sediments and increased water levels.																					978-0-203-88438-6				2009							67	93																WOS:000275052200006

Impact of cable bacteria on sedimentary iron and manganese dynamics in a seasonally-hypoxic marine basin	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Cable bacteria have recently been identified in various sedimentary marine settings worldwide. These filamentous microbes mediate electrogenic sulphur oxidation (e-SOx) over centimetre-scale distances, leading to a distinct separation of oxygen-and sulphide-bearing sediment zones. Here we present results of a year-long monthly assessment of the impact of cable bacteria on sedimentary Fe and Mn dynamics at three sites located along a water depth gradient in a seasonally-hypoxic coastal marine lake (Grevelingen, The Netherlands). Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) shows the presence of cable bacteria at two sites in spring. Micro-sensor profiling (O-2, pH, H2S) and pore water profiles of dissolved Mn, Fe2+, Ca2+ and SO42- reveal the geochemical signature of e-SOx at these sites, i.e. the development of a broad suboxic zone, characterised by a low pH and acidic dissolution of Ca/Mn carbonates and Fe sulphides. Cable bacteria activity, as reflected by dissolution of FeS in spring, was highest at the deepest and most hypoxic site. In spring, dissolved Mn and Fe2+ released at depth due to e-SOx diffused upwards and was sequestered as Mn- and Fe-(oxyhydr) oxides near the sediment surface, with Mn oxides acting as an oxidant for part of the upward diffusing Fe2+. Strikingly, the thickness of the Fe-(oxyhydr) oxide-bearing surface layer of the sediment was greatest at the most hypoxic site, emphasising the key role of cable bacteria in creating oxidised surface sediments. X-ray absorption fine structure analyses confirm the seasonality in Fe-(oxyhydr) oxide formation and reveal that the sediment Mn oxides were of biogenic (birnessite) and abiotic (hausmannite) origin. Upon the onset of hypoxia in early summer, the sediment Fe-(oxyhydr) oxides were mostly converted to Fe-sulphides but the Mn oxides dissolved and the Mn was lost to the overlying water. After summer hypoxia, Beggiatoaceae mats colonised the sediment with little further change in sediment geochemistry. Our results confirm that cable bacteria act as a key control on the coupled cycling of Fe and Mn in surface sediments of seasonally hypoxic basins. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	SHEPPE, W				SHEPPE, W			ISLAND POPULATIONS AND GENE FLOW IN THE DEER MOUSE, PEROMYSCUS-LEUCOPUS	EVOLUTION												Mouse populations of the 57 islands in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, were surveyed by live trapping. In summer 1963 1-50 mice were found on 20 islands, in densities up to 7.7 mice/acre. Fewer islands had mice in summer 1964, but 2 populations were much larger than in 1963. Mice were found primarily on the larger islands (more than 1 acre); degree of isolation seemed to be of little importance. Some islands with suitable habitats had few or no mice, while others with apparently unsuitable habitats had relatively dense populations. Mice were introduced to 26 uninhabited islands to help determine whether they could support populations. There was a high rate of loss, largely by emigration, but this was compensated for by breeding apparently stimulated by the colonization. Many colonists bred at a season when there was little breeding in natural populations. The rate of emigration was greatly reduced when an artificial food supply was put on the islands. Dispersal between islands and mainland occurs fairly frequently, by swimming in summer and perhaps by crossing the ice in winter. This amount of gene flow and the frequent extinction of populations presumably prevent genetic differentiation of island populations.																			0014-3820	1558-5646					1965	19	4					480	495		10.2307/2406245	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2406245													WOS:A1965CLA4400004

In this paper, we present a multi-proxy palaeoclimate record spanning the last -1500 years from Tadag Taal, an intermontane lake in Kumaun, India. Our dataset (stable isotope ratios, grain size, trace element ratios) suggests the occurrence of four long-term precipitation cycles of high and low rainfall coinciding with the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP, -475-850 CE), Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA -900-1300 CE), Little Ice Age (LIA, -1450-1800 CE) and Current Warm Period (CWP, -1850 CE to Present). We infer multi-decadal to centennial-scale shifts in the Indian summer monsoon co-varying with changes in El Nin & SIM;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity superimposed by changes in solar insolation. To correlate our timeseries from the northwestern Himalaya with the Core Monsoon Zone and understand coherency in precipitation between the two regions, we applied the Wavelength Coherency Test. Our data suggest wet conditions during the early phase of the LIA (-1450-1640 CE) and dry conditions in the later phase of the LIA from -1640-1800 CE. The wet conditions in the early LIA were perhaps driven by increased winter precipitation. This is in contrast to Central India that witnessed dry conditions during the entire duration of the LIA. This study thus suggests that monsoon strength was different during earlier and later phase of the LIA. Further, the LIA did not witness uniform climate variability through its duration as has been reported in some European and Chinese proxy records.

At regular intervals, bacterioplankton biomass, percentages of bacteria attached to particles, bacterioplankton productivity and oxygen consumption rates, together with a number of environmental parameters, were determined. With respect to biomass, productivity and oxygen consumption rates, no significant differences were observed between the two coastal basins. However, the mean percentages of attached bacteria were high in the tidal Oosterschelde basin compared to the stagnant Lake Grevelingen. This could be explained by the observed difference in amounts of colonizable particles. On the annual basis, however, the percentages of attached bacteria were not significantly correlated with the amounts of suspended particles at the sampling stations. A significnat, but negative correlation was found between the percentages of attached bacteria and the bacterioplankton productivities at the sampling stations. A probable mechanism for such a negative correlation is discussed. By size fractionation experiments, bacterioplankton contribution to overall oxygen consumption rates was determined. These contributions amounted to 58% and 94% in spring and winter, respectively. From specific bacterioplankton dissimilation and assimilation rates, mean bacterioplankton carbon conversion coefficients of 26% and 6% were calculated in spring and winter, respectively. These percentages are discussed in the light of probable seasonal differences in the supply of substrates for the bacterioplankton community.

Norwegian mountain glaciers in the past, present and future	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Documentation of glacier changes is a key element for reconstruction of past climate variability and early detection of global climate change. In this paper, records of Holocene glacier variations in different regions in Norway have been synthesised. During the period from approximately 8000 to 4000 cal. yr BP, most glaciers in Norway were completely melted away at least once due to high summer temperatures and/or reduced winter precipitation. Lichenometrically and historically dated moraines at Jostedalsbreen, in Jotunheimen, at Hardangerjokulen, and at Folgefonna were used to extend records of glacier length variations back to their maximum position during the `Little Ice Age'. The timing of the maximum `Little Ice Age' glacial advance in different parts of southern Norway varied considerably, ranging from the early 18th century to the late 19th century. Cumulative glacier length variations of glaciers in southern Norway show an overall retreat from similar to AD 1750 to the 1930s-40s. Thereafter, most Norwegian glaciers retreated significantly. Short maritime outlet glaciers with a short response time (< 10-15 yr) started to advance in the mid-1950s, whereas long outlet glaciers with longer frontal time lag (> 15-20 yr) continued their retreat to the 1980s. In the 1990s, however, several of the maritime glaciers started to advance as a response to higher winter accumulation during the first part of the 1990s. Since 2000 most of the observed glaciers have retreated remarkably fast (annual frontal retreat > 100 m) mainly due to high summer temperatures. The last glacier inventory in Norway published in 1988 shows that there were 1627 glaciers covering a total area of 2609 km(2) with an estimated volume of 164 km(3). Modern climate-glacier relationships from mass balance data in Scandinavia have been used to present possible effects on the Norwegian glaciers of climate scenarios between 1961-1990 and 2070-2100 presented by the 'RegClim' project. This long-term weather 'forecast' for western Norway indicates a rise in the summer temperature of 2.3 degrees C and an increase in the winter precipitation of 16% by the end of the 21st century. This climate scenario may, if it occurs, cause the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) to rise 260 +/- 50 m. As a result, about 98% of the Norwegian glaciers are likely to disappear and the glacier area may be reduced similar to 34% by AD 2100. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

In Quebec (Canada), sodium is readily available in aquatic vegetation and in salt pools that form along highways. We do not know if moose are adopting specific behaviors to access sodium sources or if they simply use the sodium sources they encounter during their movements. We tested the hypothesis that moose modify both space and habitat use to gather sodium from salt pools. We expected moose to use salt pools mostly in spring and early summer, when needs are greatest and before aquatic vegetation has fully developed. We fitted 47 moose with Global Positioning System telemetry collars and collected data for 2 to 36 months between 2003 and 2006. We rarely located moose at salt pools (0.12% among the 95,007 locations collected). As we expected, use of salt pools was highest in late spring and in early summer, and we observed a time lag between peak use of salt pools compared to use of lakes and waterways, indicating moose fulfilled their sodium requirements in salt pools before aquatic vegetation was available. Moose selected salt pools over lakes and waterways when these 2 sodium sources were present in their home range and moved rapidly over large distances to reach them. Our results were consistent with moose using salt pools when they are likely to be sodium deficient. Salt pools were less accessible, required long-distance movements, and were located in habitually avoided areas along highways. Elimination of roadside salt pools should be considered among strategies to reduce cervid-vehicle collision risks in boreal environments.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JUL	2008	72	5					1094	1100		10.2193/2007-504	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2007-504													WOS:000257454100006

We report the radiocarbon (Delta C-14) and stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) values and the carbon concentrations within dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake's western basin water column. Samples were taken during spring mixing and late-summer thermal stratification over a 2-yr period (2007-2009). Distinct processes operating in the surface (photosynthesis) and deep waters (sediment resuspension and pore-water intrusion) control the relative contribution of modern and ancient DOC and POC in the water column. The terrigenous carbon input to the open lake POC varied from 13% +/- 4% during late summer stratification to 9% +/- 3% during spring mixing, with most of the terrestrial carbon being C-14-enriched (modern). The DIC reservoir cycles rapidly, with a bulk Delta C-14(DIC) value that records atmospheric radiocarbon levels from 3 yr prior to sampling. The DOC pool recycles on a longer time scale than does the DIC, with a DOC residence time of <= 60 yr. The suspended POC was in most cases older than co-occurring DOC, most likely as a result of resuspension of lake sediments.						Minor, Elizabeth/0000-0001-6930-9338; McCallister, S.

Torsten; Kraemer, Benjamin M.; Adrian, Rita			The importance of nonrandom and random trait patterns in phytoplankton communities: a case study from Lake Muggelsee, Germany	THEORETICAL ECOLOGY												A fundamental challenge in ecology is to identify the processes which explain how species come to occupy diverse communities. There is uncertainty about whether community composition arises through deterministic processes, whereby trait differences between species make them more or less adapted to certain environmental conditions. We tested the capacity for deterministic processes to explain the long-term dynamics of phytoplankton community structure in Lake Muggelsee-a shallow and eutrophic lake in Berlin, Germany using a trait-based approach. We developed a null model representing random processes alone by generating a time series of random trait distributions derived from the observed long-term data. We determined the extent to which deterministic processes lead to nonrandom patterns in phytoplankton communities by comparing the resulting null-trait distributions with the observed trait distributions in the long-term data. We found that phytoplankton communities fell along a gradient from random to nonrandom trait distributions, suggesting that deterministic processes alone do not fully describe the community structure. Nonrandom patterns were observed in communities with high species richness and during late spring as well as early winter. But neither species richness nor seasonality explained nonrandom patterns consistently for different metrics and traits given the high relevance of random trait distribution patterns. Thus, deterministic and stochastic processes may be needed to fully explain the structure of phytoplankton communities under changing environmental conditions.

J	HAUGH, JR; CADE, TJ				HAUGH, JR; CADE, TJ			SPRING HAWK MIGRATION AROUND SOUTHEASTERN SHORE OF LAKE ONTARIO	WILSON BULLETIN												Although much is known about the fall migration of hawks from studies made at Hawk Mountain, Cedar Grove, and at other locations near the Great Lakes and along the Atlantic Coast, relatively little study has been done on spring hawk migration. The location of a major spring hawk flyway along the southern shore of Lake Ontario presented an excellent opportuinty for study. A promontory on the southeast shore of the lake, known locally as Derby Hill, was selected as a study area, and observations of hawk movements were made during the spring migration periods in 1963 and 1964. Particular attention was focused on the different spp. of hawks migrating at different times and on the effects of weather conditions upon the movement of the hawks. In general each spp. of hawk tends to migrate within a definite part of the migration season, although occasional individuals may migrate early or late. Some spp., such as the gos-hawk, red-shouldered hawk, red-tailed hawk, rough-legged hawk, American kestrel, and harrier are most common late in March or during the first week of April. Other spp., such as the broad-winged Hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, turkey vulture, and osprey are most common during the last week of April or during the first week of May, The red-tailed hawk, harrier, and Cooper''s hawk tend to have migration periods which extend over most of the spring migration season. Large spring movements of hawks are associated with southerly winds, rising temperatures, falling barometric pressure, and the approach of a low-pressure area and cold front. Because of the tendency for these weather factors to occur together, it has not been possible to isolate any one as being of primary importance in stimulating spring hawk movements. It appears doubtful, however, that temperature or actual change in atmospheric pressure directly stimulates spring movements. More likely, the factors which are of major importance are the southerly winds and rising currents of air which occur in front (east) of an approaching low-pressure area. It would be advantageous for hawks to fly on southerly winds when rising current of air are also occurring. Such "tail winds" and rising air currents enable hawks to migrate farther for a given expenditure of metabolis energy. The only hawk which frequently does not show a good association with an approaching low-pressure area is the Broad-winged Hawk. The tendency for hawks to migrate within certain hours of the day is probably related to daily variations in local weather factors and to the methods of flight which the hawks employ, although the feeding and hunting habits of these birds may also be of some importance. Those spp. which depend largely on soaring fly when updraft formation is greatest. Such updrafts probably result from the general tendency of air to rise in a low-pressure area, from thermal activity, and from the tendency of warm southerly winds to be forced up by the cool air mass over the lake. Species which employ soaring flight less frequently often begin migrating earlier in the day and continue later than those spp. that depend on the thermals to a greater degree. Migrating hawks also exhibit other responses to local weather conditions. They tend to remain close to the lake when winds are southerly and to move inland for various distances when winds are from other directions. Hawks generally fly higher and move forward more rapidly when winds are from a westerly direction. Hawks usually cease migration in rain or snow.																			0043-5643						1966	78	1					88	+																WOS:A19667542900010

Drivers of spatiotemporal variability in CO2 concentration and flux in the inflow area of a large boreal lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												River inflow affects the spatiotemporal variability of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the water column of lakes and may locally influence CO2 gas exchange with the atmosphere. However, spatiotemporal CO2 variability at river inflow sites is often unknown leaving estimates of lake-wide CO2 emission uncertain. Here, we investigated the CO2 concentration and flux variability along a river-impacted bay and remote sampling locations of Lake Onego. During 3 years, we resolved spatial CO2 gradients between river inflow and central lake and recorded the temporal course of CO2 in the bay from the ice-covered period to early summer. We found that the river had a major influence on the spatial CO2 variability during ice-covered periods and contributed similar to 35% to the total amount of CO2 in the bay. The bay was a source of CO2 to the atmosphere at ice-melt each year emitting 2-15 times the amount as an equally sized area in the central lake. However, there was large interannual variability in the spring CO2 emission from the bay related to differences in discharge and climate that affected the hydrodynamic development of the lake during spring. In early summer, the spatial CO2 variability was unrelated to the river signal but correlated negatively with dissolved oxygen concentrations instead indicating a stronger biological control on CO2. Our study reveals a large variability of CO2 and its drivers at river inflow sites at the seasonal and at the interannual time scale. Understanding these dynamics is essential for predicting lake-wide CO2 fluxes more accurately under a warming climate.

Summer ecosystem structure in mountain lakes linked to interannual variability of lake ice, snowpack, and landscape attributes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Mountain lakes experience interannual variability in spring snowpack and ice cover that can lead to differences in physical, chemical, and biological properties in the succeeding summer. Lake studies that capture extreme years of snow and ice would be useful to understand and anticipate effects of climate change, but such data are rare for remote mountain lakes. Monitoring of lakes in Olympic, North Cascades, and Mount Rainier National Parks from 2007 to 2018 allowed us to examine limnological differences along interannual and elevation-driven climate gradients that included unusually high (2011-2012) and 100-yr record low (2015) snowpack years. Years with lower spring snowpack had earlier ice-out. Across lakes, our analysis suggested an average of 0.075 degrees C lake warming per day of lost ice duration (0.525 degrees C per week), giving rise to other ecosystem changes linked to temperature such as lower dissolved oxygen, higher total dissolved N, higher chlorophyll, and higher abundance of cladoceran zooplankton. Conversely, in years with higher snowpack and a shorter ice-free season, lakes were colder and clearer (1 m deeper Secchi depth for every 1 m May snow water equivalent), with more dilute ions as well as lower algal biomass and zooplankton abundance. These results add to evidence that changes in snowpack or ice-out dates alter mountain lake ecology through multiple processes associated with hydrology, terrestrial-aquatic connection, water temperature, productivity, ion composition, and plankton communities.

The fungus was first found in a field of Katepwa wheat near Smoky Lake, Alberta. In subsequent investigations eyespot was found in both spring (hard red and soft white) and winter wheat crops at several locations in Alberta in 1989. In a survey of ten wheat field near Olds, Alberta, eyespot was found in all of the fields and on average, 41 percent of stems examined had one or more lesions. In a field of winter wheat near Innisfail, 74 percent of the stems examined had eyespot lesions and of these approximately 25 percent were severe enough to cause lodging.																			0008-476X						1990	70	2					119	121																WOS:A1990EG74700002

However, the "damming effects" on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from tributaries of reservoirs in subtropical region were largely overlooked. In this study, we assessed the GHG fluxes (CH4, CO2 and N2O) from air-water interface and the related factors in Xiangxi River of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region over one year. The annual average fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O from Xiangxi River were 0.13 +/- 0.11 mg m(-2) h(-1), 16.01 +/- 23.21 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 21.57 +/- 12.75 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively, which were significantly lower than those from tropical rivers or lakes. The GHG fluxes showed strong seasonal dynamics: CH4 was consistently released to the atmosphere and was more in summer than the other seasons. CO2 was absorbed from the atmosphere in spring, but was emitted the most in winter. N2O flux was higher in cold season than in warm season. Additionally, CH4 emission showed obvious spatial variations that decreased gradually from shallow to deep water-level areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated that CH4 emission was negatively correlated with water depth and air-water temperature difference, and positively with air temperature. CO2 flux was negatively related to chlorophyll a (Chl. a) and N2O flux was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). The present study will deepen our understanding of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) construction impacts on GHG emissions in the tributaries, and help us to better estimate GHG emissions for TGR.

Seasonal fluctuations in precipitation amplify the dynamism inherent to estuarine food webs, particularly in lagoonal estuaries, which can be seasonally closed and disconnected from the ocean in low-runoff periods (bar-built lagoons). Despite their abundance along coastlines in Mediterranean climates, the organic matter sources fueling bar-built lagoon food webs are poorly understood, particularly with respect to seasonal hydrologic variability, episodic marine connections, and internal nutrient cycling. In this study, we evaluate the food web of a bar-built lagoon with respect to seasonal differences in lagoon water quality, the sources of organic matter which support consumers, and the trophic ecology of resident fishes. Observed water quality conditions reflected biogeochemical processes associated with salinity-driven stratification and high lagoon residence times and were associated with strong seasonal differences in the contribution of different organic matter sources to lagoon consumers. A variety of organic matter sources supported consumers; marine inputs were important to lagoon food webs in spring when the lagoon was open, while summer food webs were largely driven by phytoplankton which was likely fueled by internal nutrient cycling. Fish diets were largely comprised of crustaceans and fish eggs, with clearly defined trophic niches in spring but high overlap in summer. This study demonstrates that the seasonal changes in bar-built lagoon food webs are largely dependent on ocean connectivity and internal cycling within the lagoon, rather than watershed processes as is typical for many estuaries.					; Young, Matthew/LPP-2173-2024	Young, Matthew/0000-0001-9306-6866; Kraus, Tamara/0000-0002-5187-8644; 													0272-7714	1096-0015				JAN 5	2022	264								107665	10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107665	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2021.107665													WOS:000783120700004
J	GOLDMAN, CR				GOLDMAN, CR			CONTRIBUTION OF ALDER TREES (ALNUS TENUIFOLIA) TO PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY OF CASTLE LAKE, CALIFORNIA	ECOLOGY												Studies on primary productivity of lakes of the Alaska Penninsula by the author in 1957 suggested the importance of alders as a nitrogen source. Abundance of the mountain alders on the east shore of Castle Lake provided the opportunity to study their contribution to the fertility ofa glacial cirque lake in Siskiyou County. Trout studies have been in progress at this lake since 1938. Comparison of total and inorganic nitrogen content of green and fallen alder and other deciduous leaves, soil profiles, lake sediment, spring water, lake water and outflow clearly evidenced the significant contribution of nitrogen from the alder leaves. The measured inorganic nitrogen from springs draining the east shore amounted to 15.5% of the lake''s average content from June to October. Simultaneous in situ measurements of primary productivity with C14 on both sides of the lake, as well as bioassay of the lake''s natural phytoplankton population with spring water additions gave further evidence of the contribution by alders to the primary productivity of the lake.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1961	42	2					282	+		10.2307/1932080	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932080													WOS:A19611611400008

The results show that the total numbers of bacteria and bacterioplankton production have an effect on the growth of L. baicalensis body. Bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Micrococcus, Sarcina, Flavobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Acinetobacter living in the sponges are representatives of the Baikal bacterioplankton. Actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces and Micromonospora are a permanent component of the cultivable sponge microbial community.

Runoff and precipitation dynamics in the Blue and White Nile catchments during the mid-Holocene: A data-model comparison	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Blue Nile is the major contributor of freshwater and sediments to the modern-day main Nile River and exerts a key control on seasonal flooding in the Nile valley. Recent studies have postulated that the relative contribution from the Blue Nile to the main Nile runoff might have been reduced during the mid-Holocene, at a time when higher boreal summer insolation stimulated enhanced precipitation in North Africa. Whether the decrease in the relative contribution from the Blue Nile resulted from a decrease in precipitation over the catchment, from an increase in White Nile runoff or from a combination of both is still a matter of debate. By comparing regional proxy-records with the output from a global atmospheric model zoomed on Africa, we propose that the reduced contribution from the Blue Nile at 6 ka originated from both a higher White Nile runoff and a lower Blue Nile runoff. Enhanced African and Indian monsoons at 6 ka induced a northern shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and an eastward shift of the Congo Air Boundary. Such an atmospheric configuration led to a negative anomaly of summer precipitation over the Blue Nile catchment that likely resulted in a reduction in the Blue Nile runoff. By contrast, a sustained positive anomaly of precipitation over the White Nile catchment during both summer and autumn most likely induced a higher main Nile runoff during the mid-Holocene. Using the model output, we propose a first synoptic view on regional rainfall dynamics that permits to reconcile contrasting proxy records. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Deposition samples were analyzed for a wide range of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). HCHs, DDT, DDD, DDE, chlordanes, cis-heptachlor, HCB, dieldrin and endrin were found in all samples, only aldrin was found less frequently. Differences in the mean deposition rates between the three sites reflect the different amounts of precipitation at these sites. At the northern edge of the Alps with the highest annual total precipitations, mean annual deposition rates were at least twice those at the Swiss site for most of the investigated OCP. Average annual deposition of alpha-HCH amounted to 602, 461 and 216 ng m(-2) year(-1), the sum of DDT, DDD and DDE to 579,210 and 144 ng m(-2) year(-1) and the sum of trans- and cis-chlordane to 35, 47,16 ng m(-2) year(-1) at Zugspitze, Sonnblick, and Weissfluhjoch, respectively. A quite distinct seasonal pattern of OPC deposition was observed at all three locations. For most of the HCH isomers, higher deposition rates were observed in summer than in winter at all three sites, which may be caused by enhanced re-volatilization due to higher summer temperatures and the ongoing application of HCH-containing products in some regions as well. For the other investigated OCPs, higher summer deposition rates were found only at Weissfluhjoch. This site is more often affected by air masses crossing the river Po basin than the other two sites, an area exhibiting higher summer temperatures compared to other regions adjacent to the Alps.

Analyses of multi proxies including pollen, mineralogy, grain size, and loss on ignition (LOI) were carried out on three 50 cm thick intervals of a 23.7 m thick laminated section of the Hsinchuan Core, western Taipei. The couplets are commonly composed of 2-7 mm light grey layers and 2-3 mm dark grey layers. Major components in the light grey layer are quartz (>70%) associated with clay minerals (illite). Clay minerals increase in the dark grey layer and can dominate. A pollen study indicates that the light grey layers are characterized by more abundant warm elements such as Cyclobalanopsis and Castanopsis, while the dark grey layers have more abundant cool elements including Pinaceae (Pinus, Picea, Tsuga), Alnus and significant amounts of Poaceae. Study of the present pollen calendar of the Taipei Basin indicates that Pinus appears during winter-spring and Cyclobalanopsis and Castanopsis appear during early summer. The studied couplets are thus very possibly seasonal deposits of the ancient lake. Spectrum analysis for the thickness variation of the light grey laminae, believed to represent most of the annual precipitation changes in summereautumn, shows prominent El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) peaks of 3-4 and 6-7 year periods. This may indicate that ENSO events occurred during the middle Pleistocene glaciation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Biro, PA; Post, JR; Beckmann, C				Biro, Peter A.; Post, John R.; Beckmann, Christa			Autumn lipid reserves, overwinter lipid depletion, and high winter mortality of rainbow trout in experimental lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Accumulation of lipid reserves is considered important for the overwinter survival of many animals. Fish are thought to deplete lipids until they reach a critical minimum below which starvation mortality occurs, meaning that lipid-dependent selective overwinter mortality may be a strong selective pressure leading to life-history evolution favouring lipid accumulation and storage. Much of our current knowledge comes from either laboratory studies or field studies that are not well controlled, but rarely is overwinter survival directly estimated to evaluate selective mortality. Here, we studied patterns of lipid storage, overwinter lipid depletion, and subsequent survival of a single strain of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) stocked into experimental lakes that differed in productivity but experienced the same local winter conditions. Productive lakes produced trout with higher lipid content and steeper allometric slopes in contrast with trout in low food lakes; however, these field-based values were all substantially lower than those determined in the lab. Surviving trout from low productivity lakes emerged from winter in poor condition, close to the expected critical minimum needed for survival, in comparison with survivors from higher-productivity lakes. As expected, overwinter mortality was lipid-dependent, with fish in low food lakes nearing 90% mortality and about 60% mortality in high food lakes. Importantly, these estimates are higher than from laboratory (similar to 70%) and modelling studies (0% to 14%) for this species. These results, though from stocked populations, suggest winter mortality is an even stronger selective pressure than previously thought, creating a tight population bottleneck in young fish cohorts and likely promoting life-history strategies that favour energy storage at the expense of somatic growth.

J	Auer, MT; Bub, LA				Auer, MT; Bub, LA			Selected features of the distribution of chlorophyll along the southern shore of Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Monitoring was conducted over the April to October interval of 1999 and 2000, seeking signals in the spatiotemporal structure of algal biomass (chlorophyll) in Lake Superior. Sampling was conducted along three nearshore-offshore transects in the vicinity of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula. Levels of algal biomass in Lake Superior are the lowest in the Great Lakes, with chlorophyll concentrations ranging from similar to 0.25 to 2.5 mg center dot m(-3) and averaging less than 1mg center dot m(-3) in the surface waters. Several spatial signals were observed, including inter-transect differences, nearshore-offshore gradients, and vertical structure. These signals are thought to be mediated by several factors, including runoff from a major tributary, light availability and mixing depth, inter-transect variations in bathymetry and temperature gradients, e.g., the thermal bar in spring and vertical stratification in summer. Seasonally, surface water chlorophyll dynamics were characterized by an increase from late-winter concentrations in late April and early May, a continued increase in the nearshore and a decreaselstabilization at offshore sites from late May through July, a summer minimum in late July and August and an increase in September and October with the approach to turnover. These signals are striking given the modest levels of chlorophyll present in the lake and considering prevailing conditions of light, temperature and phosphorus availability. The spatial and temporal structure evidenced here likely resonates through the system, impacting the distribution of organisms both higher and lower in the food web. These results will find application in this and other similar systems for consideration of the vernal thermal bar as a factor mediating primary production and cross-margin transport of materials of biogeochemical significance, in developing a greater appreciation of the role of the microbial loop in fostering secondary production, in defining the relative roles of allochthonous and autochthonous contributions to the carbon budget and in supporting remote sensing studies of large scale transport phenomena in the lake.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			269	284		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70391-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70391-3													WOS:000227991500019
J	Byström, P; Persson, L; Wahlström, E				Byström, P; Persson, L; Wahlström, E			Competing predators and prey:: Juvenile bottlenecks in whole-lake experiments	ECOLOGY												In size-structured populations, prey have the potential to restrict the recruitment of their predator by decreasing the growth rate of young predators through interspecific competition, a situation referred to as a ''competitive juvenile bottleneck.'' Two mechanisms have been advanced by which a decrease in growth may increase the mortality of young predators: (1) increased time during which juvenile predators are susceptible to gape-limited predation and (2) increased susceptibility to starvation. To study the effects of competition from a prey fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) on the recruitment of a piscivorous fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis), roach were introduced in two of four small adjacent unproductive lakes inhabited by natural populations of perch. We thereafter studied the diet, growth, and survival of the new-born cohorts of perch during a 13-mo period. Growth and survival of larval perch were not affected by roach whereas during the latter part of the growing season, growth and condition of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch were negatively affected by roach. The growth retardation of YOY perch in roach-treatment lakes coincided with a shift in diet from free-swimming zooplankton to benthic cladocerans and chironomids, which in turn was related to a stronger decline in pelagic zooplankton resources in these lakes. The small size and poor condition of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes resulted in almost all these perch dying from starvation during the winter and subsequent spring. There was a tendency for there to be higher densities of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes, possibly due to a strong die-off of adult perch in these lakes that in turn may have reduced cannibalism in these lakes. The results from an enclosure experiment on intra-cohort competition among YOY perch, however, suggested that the discrepancy in growth of YOY perch between the lakes was mainly due to direct competition from roach for the zooplankton resource. Temporal variation in competition intensity and in duration of periods for growth and energy gain (e.g., summer) vs. periods of only energy loss (e.g., winter) are suggested to have major effects on juvenile predator growth and subsequent recruitment to the adult stage through competitive juvenile bottlenecks, and thus to affect overall community dynamics. The relative importance of size-dependent winter starvation mortality compared to mortality caused by gape-limited predators as a mortality agent on juveniles is hypothesized to increase with latitude. Whole-lake experiments lend themselves both to testing the importance in natural systems of mechanisms previously identified at small spatial and short temporal scales, and also to identifying important mechanisms that cannot be studied at smaller scales.

Observations on gut content data revealed a variety of feeding habits, with some potential diet overlap between European whitefish (Coregonous lavaretus), Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), and Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) during the winter and spring. However, food resources seemed to be partitioned among the Lake Annecy fish community during summer growth period, possibly limiting competitive interactions. Ten years of SIA data were used to evaluate food web dynamics. Values of 15N indicated very low interspecies variability, whereas 13C revealed the differences between fish species; pelagic species were 13C depleted, while littoral species were 13C enriched. The results demonstrated that Arctic char have a separate sustainable dietary niche and lower predation mortality. Stocking Arctic char to enhance populations might not have an impact on other fish populations. We found that the natural dietary variability can be misinterpreted when using GCA only. Our findings highlight the importance of combining both GCA and SIA to explore the trophic relationships between predators and prey, especially in Lake Annecy having spatial and seasonal variations in prey isotopic signatures. Results from these studies on food web dynamics could have implications in fisheries management decisions and development of trophic models.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2011	27	2					115	127	PII 936032190	10.1080/07438141.2011.566413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2011.566413													WOS:000291853900002

In this study, we determined the trace element exposure of herbivorous whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) wintering in Swan Lake (Rongcheng), an important swan protection area in northern China. A total of 70 samples including abiotic factors (seawater, sediments), food sources (seagrass, macroalgae), feathers and feces of whooper swans were collected from the marine lagoon during the winters of 2014/2015 and 2015/2016. Concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg and As were determined to investigate the trace element exposure of whooper swans wintering in the area. Results showed that there was an increasing trend in sediment trace element concentrations, compared with historical data. The trace element concentrations in swan feces most closely resembled those of Zostera marina leaves, especially for Cd and Cr. The Zn and Hg concentrations in the swan feces (49.57 and 0.01 mg/kg, respectively) were lower than the minimum values reported in the literature for other waterfowls, waterbirds and terrestrial birds. However, the concentrations of the other five trace elements fell within the lower and mediate range of values reported for birds across the world. These results suggest that the whooper swans wintering in Swan Lake, Rongcheng are not suffering severe trace element exposure; however, with the increasing input of trace elements to the lagoon, severe adverse impacts may occur in the future, and we therefore suggest that the input of trace elements to this area should be curbed.

We surveyed the distribution and abundance of two spring-dependent invertebrates, the Japanese freshwater crab Geothelphusa dehaani and larvae of dragonfly Anotogaster sieboldii, at 37 spring-fed wetlands in the Lake Inba watershed, Japan. The relationships among local factors (water temperature, channel-water velocity, substrate type, and abundance of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii), a landscape-scale factor (the percentage of permeable surface in catchment; PPSC), and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of each species were analyzed using path analyses. PPSC indirectly affected the CPUE of both G. dehaani and A. sieboldii via different processes. For G. dehaani, PPSC affected the CPUE via a positive effect on channel-water velocity and substrate composition in the wetland. On the other hand, PPSC positively affected the CPUE of A. sieboldii by decreasing the summer water temperature. Red swamp crayfish had no significant direct effects on either species, although we found a significant negative effect of channel-water velocity on the distribution of red swamp crayfish. For conservation of these spring-dependent species, we suggest preserving the area of permeable surface in the watershed in order to maintain flow velocity and low water temperature in wetlands.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				JAN	2023	38	1					146	153		10.1111/1440-1703.12352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.12352		AUG 2022											WOS:000851496900001

Radar imaging of winter seismic survey activity in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska	POLAR RECORD												During the spring of 2006, Radarsat-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was acquired on a continual basis for the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA), in the northeast portion of the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska (NPR-A) in order to monitor lake ice melting processes. During data processing, it was discovered that the Radarsat-1 imagery detected features associated with winter seismic survey activity. Focused analysis of the image time series revealed various aspects of the exploration process such as the grid profile associated with the seismic line surveys as well as trails and campsites associated with the mobile survey crews. Due to the high temporal resolution of the dataset it was possible to track the progress of activities over a one month period. Spaceborne SAR imagery can provide information on the location of winter seismic activity and could be used as a monitoring tool for land and resource managers as increased petroleum-based activity occurs in the TLSA and NPR-A.					; Lu, Zhong/MZQ-2483-2025	Selkowitz, David/0000-0003-0824-7051; Arp, Christopher/0000-0002-6485-6225; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Lu, Zhong/0000-0001-9181-1818													0032-2474					JUL	2008	44	230					227	231		10.1017/S0032247407007206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0032247407007206													WOS:000257222300003
J	Straile, D; Rothhaupt, KO				Straile, Dietmar; Rothhaupt, Karl-Otto			Qualitative and quantitative changes in phenology of chlorophyll a concentrations during the transition from eutrophy to oligotrophy	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												The PEG (Plankton Ecology Group) model predicts differences in phenology between eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes regarding the occurrence, timing and magnitude of annual chlorophyll maxima and minima. While these predictions have been tested between lakes, hardly any tests exist using long-term data. We test these predictions using chlorophyll time-series (1980-2019) from Lake Constance in which trophic status shifted from eutrophic to oligotrophic conditions. We show that oligotrophication subsequently resulted in reduction of the summer and spring blooms, and finally the loss of the clear-water phase. In contrast to the PEG model the spring bloom was not delayed, but advanced with oligotrophication. Warming modified the seasonal patterns via advancing clear-water timing. Oligotrophication did not only influence phenologies, but also the importance of independent variables driving phenologies. Thus, the decline of nutrients was the dominant factor in shaping the seasonal patterns of chlorophyll in Lake Constance during the last four decades.

J	Jenkin, PM				Jenkin, PM			Seasonal changes in the temperature of Windermere (English Lake District)	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The temp. of this "coastal" lake was surveyed between Nov., 1931, and Oct., 1932, through use of water bottle samples at 7 or 8 depths. The lake is divided into 2 basins with mean depths of 26 and 17.7 m. The lake seldom freezes in the winter and is classified as belonging to the "second order." Seasonal changes in temp. at all depths are plotted in detail. Thermal stratification occurs only in the summer with complete isolation of the hypolimnion from July 22 to Aug. 11, although partial isolation occurs for a longer time. The steepest gradient in the "discontinuity layer" was 0.9[degree]C/m. The density of the water at various depths was measured. The annual heat budget and summer heat income for the north basin were 17,500 and 20,490 and for the south basin, 13,230 and 15,680 g. cal./sq. cm., respectively. The relation of biol. productivity to the temp. range and to both the duration and the degree of summer isolation of the hypolimnion is stressed. Comparisons are made between this lake and others in central Europe, Scandinavia, Scotland, and N. America.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1942	11						248	269		10.2307/1360	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1360													WOS:000201318200016

An evaluation of fish spawning on degraded and remnant reefs in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Saginaw Bay is a shallow, nutrient-rich embayment in Lake Huron that historically had a complex net-work of natural rocky reefs. These reef habitats were used as spawning and nursery areas for a variety of fish species, but decades of land-use related sedimentation caused many of these reefs to be degraded. Our study objectives were to analyze abiotic and biotic conditions on degraded and remnant reefs and describe spawning patterns of walleye (Sander vitreus) and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) at these sites to determine the potential for increased utilization following reef restoration. During fall and spring 2014-2016, we evaluated water quality and egg predation at four sites with varying levels of reef degradation. Further, we documented reproductive utilization through capture of spawning adults and quantification of egg deposition. Walleye and lake whitefish utilized multiple sites for reproduction; however, densities of spawners and deposited eggs were low, suggesting that they were not utilizing study sites as major spawning locations. Walleye and lake whitefish eggs were eaten by multiple fish spe-cies, including larger fish such as channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). Dissolved oxygen levels were ade-quate (i.e., >7 mg 0(2) L-1) during spring walleye egg incubation; however, bottom dissolved oxygen levels became very low at some sites during winter ice cover, coinciding with lake whitefish egg incubation. As restoration of rocky reefs proceeds in the Bay, evidence of remnant reef spawning fish bodes well for long-term success, though potential limiting factors such as low dissolved oxygen, sedimentation, and egg predation require continued monitoring.

J	Rao, YR; Milne, JE; Marvin, CH				Rao, Yerubandi R.; Milne, J. E.; Marvin, C. H.			Hydrodynamics and water quality in western Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The hydrodynamics and water quality parameters in the nearshore waters of western Lake Ontario (WLO) were examined using time series data from late-spring to early-summer of 2006. In general, the observed water quality parameters were within the expected limits of Lake Ontario. The observations suggest that in this region, the nearshore-offshore gradients of nutrients were influenced by the formation of a coastal boundary layer. Comparison of time series of physical and nutrient measurements reveal that upwelling due to winds from the west and downwelling due to winds from the east affect the water quality during the summer. These observations further confirm that moderate to significant taste and odour events in drinking water were due to strong downwelling episodes of surface water to intake depths in late summer. Resuspension of bottom material by surface wind waves was another mechanism that affects the water quality in WLO.

Palaeoclimatic studies in this region since the Holocene have primarily focused on interpreting proxy significance from sediments, resulting in being highly controversial. However, exploring palaeoclimate evolution through sediment provenance and proxy integration remains rare. This study analysed the elemental geochemical properties of two fluvial-lacustrine-aeolian profiles in Hudong Sandy Land, east of the Qinghai Lake Basin, and compared these with published modern basin sediments and extensively investigated Late Quaternary aeolian deposits. It was found that Hudong Sandy Land sediments exhibit similar geochemical compositions to other modern basin sediments, primarily consisting of SiO2, Al2O3 and CaO. Contrary to previous understanding, lacustrine sediments in the Hudong Sandy Land are closer to the upper continental crust average than aeolian deposits. Geochemical ratios and parameters suggested that Hudong Sandy Land sediments primarily derived from mixed source rocks of felsic igneous, quartzose sedimentary and intermediate igneous provenances. A comparison with published elemental geochemical data from the basin reveals distinct sediment sources during different periods in the Hudong Sandy Land. From 9.6 to 4.0 ka bp, Hudong Sandy Land hosted numerous lake environments, with sediments displaying a dominant role in sedimentary recycling and reworking, implying a continuously stronger East Asian summer monsoon. During 8.2 to 5.1 ka bp, the Hudong Sandy Land was a fluvial depositional sink for sediments from the Dabanshan Mountains. Bedrock clastic material generated by intense erosion and monsoonal runoff transport contributed to Hudong Sandy Land sedimentation, indicating the East Asian summer monsoon's peak since 9.6 ka bp. After 4.0 ka bp, thick aeolian sands accumulated in the Hudong Sandy Land, primarily derived from Lake Qinghai sediments due to declining water levels, indicating that westerlies and East Asian winter monsoon dominated the basin, with a weaker East Asia summer monsoon. This study facilitates a deeper understanding of the interaction between the East Asia summer monsoon and East Asia winter monsoon/westerlies.					lu, ruijie/AEL-2664-2022; Ding, Zhiyong/IUQ-0526-2023; Chen, Snow/GYV-4522-2022	DING, Zhiyong/0000-0002-6658-7460; 													0037-0746	1365-3091				JAN	2024	71	1					54	80		10.1111/sed.13128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.13128		AUG 2023											WOS:001050826500001

Movement and Spatial Distribution of Common Carp in a South Dakota Glacial Lake System: Implications for Management and Removal	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Common Carp Cyprinus carpio form dense populations that often negatively impact water quality and clarity, native fish communities, and aquatic plant growth in aquatic ecosystems outside their native range, including the U.S. Midwest. In an attempt to guide future management and control activities, we used acoustic telemetry to quantify monthly spatial distributions and movement patterns for adult Common Carp in Brant and Round lakes, South Dakota, during open-water periods for 2 years. During a span of 12 months of manual tracking in the spring, summer, and fall seasons, we obtained 530 locations from 19 acoustically tagged fish. In general, fish displayed a clear tendency to aggregate in shallow depths close to shore during the spawning period in May and June and also postspawn during August. In contrast, fish dispersed offshore into deeper water during July. Mean hourly movement rates during 24-h tracking sessions ranged from 100.3 m/h to 165.9 m/h. Although nonsignificant, the highest movement rates occurred in June and October and during the dusk period. Our results, along with similar studies in the region, indicate predictable and repeatable seasonal aggregations and distributions of Common Carp that will likely aid in the development of sampling protocols and control programs for temperate lakes. These results can be used to develop integrated control techniques that would target adult fish during periods of seasonal aggregations and dispersions, which is critical for effective population control.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2014	34	6					1270	1281		10.1080/02755947.2014.959674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2014.959674													WOS:000348391600023

Change in the Circulation Regime in the Stratified Saline Lake Shira (Siberia, Republic of Khakassia)	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The in-situ data on the vertical structure and stability of the vertical stratification of saline Lake Shira over the past decade (2007-2015) are analyzed. Simplified mathematical models have shown that strong wind in the autumn of 2014 together with rather thick ice in the winter of 2015 caused a change in the circulation regime of this water reservoir from meromictic (incomplete mixing) to holomictic (compete mixing). Based on the results obtained, a circulation regime for deep saline lakes located in the continental climate zone, in particular, in the arid zones of Southern Siberia (Khakassia, Transbaikal, and Altai) can be predicted under various climate scenarios of the future.

Throughout the Holarctic, three lateral plate morphs are observed; the low, partial and completely plated morph. We test if the three plate morphs in the brackish water Lake Engervann, Norway, differ in body size, trophic morphology (gill raker number and length), niche (stable isotopes; delta N-15, delta C-13, and parasites (Theristina gasterostei, Trematoda spp.)), genetic structure (microsatellites) and the lateral-plate encoding Stn382 (Ectodysplasin) gene. We examine differences temporally (autumn 2006/spring 2007) and spatially (upper/lower sections of the lake -reflecting low versus high salinity). Results: All morphs belonged to one gene pool. The complete morph was larger than the low plated, with the partial morph intermediate. The number of lateral plates ranged 8-71, with means of 64.2 for complete, 40.3 for partial, and 14.9 for low plated morph. Stickleback delta N-15 was higher in the lower lake section, while delta C-13 was higher in the upper section. Stickleback isotopic values were greater in autumn. The low plated morph had larger variances in delta N-15 and delta C-13 than the other morphs. Sticklebacks in the upper section had more T. gasterostei than in the lower section which had more Trematoda spp. Sticklebacks had less T. gasterostei, but more Trematoda spp. in autumn than spring. Sticklebacks with few and short rakers had more T. gasterostei, while sticklebacks with longer rakers had more Trematoda. spp. Stickleback with higher delta N-15 values had more T. gasterostei, while sticklebacks with higher delta N-15 and delta C-13 values had more Trematoda spp. The low plated morph had fewer Trematoda spp. than other morphs. Conclusions: Trait-ecology associations may imply that the three lateral plate morphs in the brackish water lagoon of Lake Engervann are experiencing ongoing divergent selection for niche and migratory life history strategies under high gene flow. As such, the brackish water zone may generally act as a generator of genomic diversity to be selected upon in the different environments where threespine sticklebacks can live.					; Harrod, Chris/A-8830-2008; Vøllestad, Leif/H-7305-2019	Bernatchez, Louis/0000-0002-8085-9709; Ostbye, Kjartan/0000-0002-9944-2313; 													1471-2148					FEB 5	2018	18									10.1186/s12862-018-1128-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-018-1128-y								29402230					WOS:000424461700002
J	Wen, Y; Zhang, WQ; Shan, BQ; Qu, J				Wen, Yan; Zhang, Wenqiang; Shan, Baoqing; Qu, Jie			Evidence of temperature-controlled dissolved inorganic nitrogen distribution in a shallow lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems as an available source of nitrogen (N). Despite recent advances in our understanding of the effects of climate change on DIN in coastal waters, shallow high-latitude lakes exposed to large seasonal temperature differences have received limited research attention. Therefore, in the present study, Baiyangdian Lake (BYDL) was selected as the study area, as a typical high latitude shallow lake in North China. Based on water and sediment samples collected in spring, summer and winter seasons, DIN accumulation in sedimentary pore water and DIN diffusion fluxes at the sediment-water interface were quantified under different temperature conditions. Correlation analysis was used to establish the effects of temperature on DIN concentration and diffusion in different media. Results show that the diffusion of DIN at the lake sediment-water interface exhibited a strongly positive relationship with temperature, suggesting that high temperature conditions lead to greater DIN release from sediments. Cold temperatures cause DIN accumulation in sedimentary pore water, providing sufficient substrate for N-related bacteria in the sediment under cold temperature conditions. Temperature controls the vertical distribution of DIN by affecting its migratory diffusion and transformation at the sediment-water interface. These findings are valuable for understanding the impact of climate change on the distribution of N in inland shallow lakes, especially in high latitude shallow lakes subjected to large seasonal temperature differences throughout the year.

URANIUM ISOTOPES IN SOILS AS A PROXY FOR PAST INFILTRATION AND PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE WESTERN UNITED STATES	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The intermittent presence of large Pleistocene lakes in the southwestern interior of North America, a region that is now a semi-arid desert, suggests repeated oscillations between profoundly different climatic conditions. The origin of these shifts is still unresolved due to inconsistencies in existing climate proxy data (for example, pollen, lake levels, and oxygen isotopes in speleothems). To resolve the inconsistencies in the water balance over the last 10 to 60 kyr, we use uranium isotopic variations in secondary soil minerals to quantify net infiltration and precipitation along a north-south transect in western North America. We show that winter infiltration increased by 30 to 100 percent, and precipitation by a lesser amount, in the valleys of the Great Basin and Mojave deserts between 60 and similar to 26 ka. This increase in infiltration and precipitation preceded the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the timing of most lake highstands in the region by 5 to 10 kyr, respectively, suggesting a possible Last Precipitation Maximum (LPM) that coincided with a minimum in winter insolation. Subsequent decreases in infiltration and precipitation after the LGM can be reconciled with the timing of lake highstands if colder summer temperatures due to a minimum in summer insolation reduced lake evaporation. The soil records, combined with a range of proxy data, suggest that seasonal insolation is the long-term driver for large shifts in both precipitation and surface water variability in the region.

J	Gaedke, U; Hochstädter, S; Straile, D				Gaedke, U; Hochstädter, S; Straile, D			Interplay between energy limitation and nutritional deficiency:: Empirical data and food web models	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Food quality may play an important role in consumer population dynamics. The frequently large differences in elemental and biochemical composition observed between autotrophs and their grazers suggest that food quality may be of particular importance for herbivores. Under nutrient-depleted conditions the carbon-to-nutrient ratios of autotrophs can increase to such an extent that consumers become nutrient rather than energy limited. Estimating the importance of this effect in situ in pelagic food webs is complicated by the omnivory of many consumers and by rapid nutrient recycling. Isolated predator-prey studies inadequately represent this interactions instead, an ecosystem perspective is required. We used seven years of data from large, deep Lake Constance to develop seasonally resolved flux models of the pelagic food web and analyzed the balance between energy and nutrient constraints. The carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) flows were simultaneously quantified and balanced. C represented food quantity/energy. P was taken as a surrogate of food quality. because algal C:P ratios exceeded the threshold above which P limitation of herbivores is predicted by stoichiometric theory throughout summer and autumn. Primary production exceeded bacterial C production by a factor of 3, but autotrophs and bacteria took up approximately equal amounts of P during summer and autumn. As a consequence, the C and P supplies of suspension-feeding zooplankton were decoupled: Consumer C demands were largely met by phytoplankton whereas P was mostly obtained from bacteria and their protist predators. The degree of consumer P deficiency varied according to supplementation of their algal diet with P-enriched bacteria or bacterivores. This favored the occurrence of omnivores, i.e., organisms that minimized P deficiencies at the cost of enhanced energy limitation. In contrast with previous perceptions, P remineralization during P-depleted summer conditions was dominated by bacterivorous flagellates, carnivorous crustaceans, and fish, which fed on prey with an elemental composition similar to their own, whereas herbivores contributed only 30% of P cycling despite their large biomass and C production. Our results suggested a co-limitation of predominantly herbivorous consumers by C and P and a mutual dependence of the two types of deficiency at the individual and system level. This pattern is not specific to pelagic systems but appears to be applicable across ecosystem types.

Seasonal changes of arsenic speciation in lake waters in relation to eutrophication	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, the influence of eutrophication on arsenic speciation in lake waters was investigated. Surface water samples (n = 1-10) were collected from 18 lakes in Japan during July 2007 and February 2008. The lakes were classified into mesotrophic (7 lakes) and eutrophic (11 lakes) based on the total phosphate (T-P) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in water column. Inorganic, methylated and ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic species were determined by combining hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry with ultraviolet irradiation. Organoarsenicals (mainly methylated and ultraviolet-labile fractions) comprised 30-60% of the total arsenic in most lakes during summer. On the other hand, inorganic arsenic species (As(III + V)) dominates (about 60-85%) during winter. The occurrence of ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic was higher in eutrophic lakes than those in mesotrophic lakes in both seasons. The concentration of dimethyl arsenic (DMAA) was high in eutrophic lakes during winter; and in mesotrophic lakes during summer. The results suggest that the conversion of As(III + V) to more complicated organoarsenicals occurred frequently in eutrophic lakes compared to that in mesotrophic lakes, which is thought to be the influence of biological activity in the water column. The distribution of arsenic species were well correlated with phosphate concentrations than those of Chl-a. This might be due to the competitive uptake of As(V) and phosphate by phytoplankton. The organoarsenicals (OrgAs)/As(V) ratio was higher at low phosphate concentration indicating that conversion of As(V) to OrgAs species was more active in phosphate-exhausted lakes with high phytoplankton density.

Seasonal Gene Expression and the Ecophysiological Implications of Toxic Microcystis aeruginosa Blooms in Lake Taihu	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Harmful cyanobacterial blooms represent an increasing threat to freshwater resources globally. Despite increased research, the physiological basis of how the dominant bloom-forming cyanobacteria, Microcystis spp., proliferate and then maintain high population densities through changing environmental conditions is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the transcriptional profiles of the microbial community in Lake Taihu, China at 9 stations sampled monthly from June to October in 2014. To target Microcystis populations, we collected metatranscriptomic data and mapped reads to the M. aeruginosa NIES 843 genome. Our results revealed significant temporal gene expression patterns, with many genes separating into either early or late bloom clusters. About one-third of genes observed from M. aeruginosa were differentially expressed between these two clusters. Conductivity and nutrient availability appeared to be the environmental factors most strongly associated with these temporal gene expression shifts. Compared with the early bloom season (June and July), genes involved in N and P transport, energy metabolism, translation, and amino acid biosynthesis were down-regulated during the later season (August to October). In parallel, genes involved in regulatory functions as well as transposases and the production of microcystin and extracellular polysaccharides were up-regulated in the later season. Our observation indicates an eco-physiological shift occurs within the Microcystis spp. transcriptome as cells move from the rapid growth of early summer to bloom maintenance in late summer and autumn.					; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021	LeCleir, Gary/0000-0002-0228-7557; Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077; Krausfeldt, Lauren/0000-0001-7405-427X; paerl, hans/0000-0003-2211-1011; Boyer, Gregory/0000-0003-4490-5461; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 2	2018	52	19					11049	11059		10.1021/acs.est.8b01066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b01066								30168717					WOS:000446542100017
J	HORN, H; PAUL, L				HORN, H; PAUL, L			INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LIGHT SITUATION, DEPTH OF MIXING AND PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH DURING THE SPRING PERIOD OF FULL CIRCULATION	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Investigations lasting several years at artificial Lake Saidenbach have shown that, due to the poor light situation expressed in terms of average daily radiation, mean daily exposure, extinction depth and the ratio zmix/zeu, no mass development of the phytoplankton should actually occur during the spring complete circulation. In practice, the period of complete circulation of the water in spring is not only a prerequisite for, but often also the factor causing, the mass development (usually Asterionella formosa). The poor light situation and the fact that the vertical phytoplankton profile shows significant differences between the plankton concentrations at different depths indicate that the spring complete circulation does not represent a complete recirculation, and thus mixing, of the water down to the bottom but involves only episodic and local partial recirculations interspersed with periods of relatively slight turbulence. The actual mixing depth during this period of coimplete circulation is therefore obviously less than the mean depth of the water concerned, which it is commonly assumed to equal. This permits the algae in the upper layers to grow. Respiratory losses of the phytoplankton at greater depths probably remain slight due to their adaptation to low light intensities in winter.																			0020-9309						1984	69	4					507	519		10.1002/iroh.19840690405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19840690405													WOS:A1984TN24500003

As the knowledge about the diversity and ecological importance of periphytic ciliates in floodplain habitats is still limited, the main objectives of this study were to analyse the temporal variations in the community structure and functional role and reveal the main environmental factors controlling community dynamics. The study was conducted in one of the Danube?s largest conserved floodplains ? Kopac?ki Rit in Croatia. In situ research included two experimental series in a lake, the first from spring till winter and the second from summer till winter. Samples were collected biweekly using glass slides as artificial substrates for periphyton development. During the study, two hydrological (low-water and high-water) periods interchanged. High-water periods were characterized by greater water transparency and nutrient concentrations, while electrical conductivity, chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended solids and particulate organic matter in water were higher during low-water periods. Furthermore, hydrological changes greatly affected the periphytic ciliate communities and the highest abundances were registered during low water levels. We identified a total of 133 ciliate taxa, among which the peritrichs, sessile filter feeders, were the dominant representatives in the periphyton, with the highest densities registered in the absence of floods. During extremely high water levels, the composition of the ciliate community in periphyton changed, with mobile ciliates, predators and filter feeders, becoming dominant. This study indicates that the main food source for periphytic ciliates in a floodplain lake are bacteria and algae, confirming the important role of these microorganisms in the lake food web, by making the carbon fixed in bacteria and algae available for the organisms of higher trophic levels. Additionally, periphytic ciliates have a considerable effect on planktonic organisms in the lake, thus connecting benthic and pelagic food webs, especially during low-water periods.

Diet shifts by planktivorous and benthivorous fishes in northern Lake Michigan in response to ecosystem changes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In Lake Michigan, diets of planktivorous and benthivorous fishes have varied over the past decades, in part owing to food web changes. To update diet information and compare them to a similar effort in 1994-1995, we analyzed the diets of seven benthivorous and planktivorous fish species collected along two northern Lake Michigan transects that spanned nearshore (18 m), intermediate (46 m), and offshore (91, 110, 128 m) bottom depths during spring, summer, and autumn of 2010. Calanoid copepods (e.g., Limnocalanus macrurus, Leptodiaptomus sicilis, and Senecella calanoides) comprised a majority of the diets in at least one season for all sizes of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), bloater (Coregonus hoyi), and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). Similarly, Mysis diluviana was the highest proportion in at least one season for large sizes of alewife, bloater, and rainbow smelt, as well as slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii). The diets of the remaining two species, ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), were dominated by herbivorous cladocerans or dreissenid mussels, respectively. Interspecific diet overlap was minimal at 18 and 46 m. In offshore waters, however, overlap was relatively high, driven by frequent consumption of Mysis. Relative to 1994-1995, 2010 diets revealed increased feeding on calanoid copepods and Mysis, with corresponding declining consumption of Diporeia spp. and herbivorous cladocerans. Relative diet weight was also higher in 1994-1995 than in 2010 for small and large bloater and both sculpin species. We hypothesize that the shifts in diets are reflective of community-level changes in invertebrate prey availability.

An index based on the pollen record of thermophilous trees and terrestrial herbs is used as an indicator of winter temperature conditions controlled by the EAWM, at the glacial-interglacial scale. Primary age control was established based on lithostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy, and then the pollen index was correlated to the LR04 global benthic delta O-18 record and finally tuned to Earth orbital obliquity to produce a high-resolution astronomical time scale. The pollen record indicates that the EAWM underwent two stepwise enhancements at 2.8 and 1.6 Ma. These events are consistent with paleoclimatic records of mean quartz grain size from the Chinese Loess Plateau, and they are also in accord with the initiation and intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Our findings suggest that the variability of the EAWM since 3.6 Ma was primarily controlled by changes in global ice volume and climatic cooling.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022; Xiao, Xiayun/G-1396-2012	Xin, Shouzhen/0000-0001-9843-0196													0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2020	93	1					40	59	PII S0033589419000450	10.1017/qua.2019.45	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2019.45													WOS:000506951900003

J	Salmaso, N; Padisák, J				Salmaso, Nico; Padisak, Judit			Morpho-functional groups and phytoplankton development in two deep lakes (Lake Garda, Italy and Lake Stechlin, Germany)	HYDROBIOLOGIA					14th Workshop of the International-Association-of-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology	SEP 04-11, 2005	Sapanca, TURKEY	Int Assoc Phytoplankton Taxon & Ecol				Phylogenetic classifications of plants often do not reflect their ecological functions. In fact, the functional mechanisms of biological communities may be better understood if species are pooled into groups having similar characteristics. The objective of this work is to evaluate, with the use of multivariate methods, classifications based on the morphological and functional characteristics (size and form, mobility, potential mixotrophy, nutrient requirements, presence of gelatinous envelopes) of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae to explain the seasonal dynamic of the phytoplankton community. The analyses involve data from two deep lakes: Lake Garda, southern Alps, z(max) = 350 m; biennium 2002-2003) and Lake Stechlin (north-east Germany, z(max) = 67 m; 1995, 1998 and 2001). In both lakes, the temporal evolution of the phytoplankton communities within individual years followed a regular annual cycle, with the exception of Lake Stechlin in 1998, when an irregular phytoplankton pattern was caused by a sudden mass appearance of Planktothrix rubescens in the spring and summer months, resulting in a collapse of the whole community in autumn. Overall, the temporal developments of the phytoplankton communities obtained on the basis of patterns of the morpho-functional groups appeared highly comparable with those obtained, in the single years, on the basis of the original phytoplankton species matrices. The comparison of the morpho-functional groups of the lakes Garda and Stechlin showed important differences in the abundance and seasonality of the dominant phytoplankton types. The results obtained in this study underline that the use of classifications based on the adaptive strategies of the single species may represent a useful tool to investigate the community evolution and to compare phytoplankton assemblages of different lakes, overcoming problems related to possible differences of taxonomic accuracy and identification.

In areas with significant snow events, the use of wintertime roadway abrasives for traction control can result in increased PM emissions. An alternative control measure is to use chemical deicers prior to a snow event to minimize ice formation and reduce the need for abrasives. Street sweeping is also commonly used to reduce the impact of re-entrained abrasive material after the snow pack on the road has cleared. In this study, we performed roadside measurements of PM flux and instrumented vehicle PM measurements to evaluate the effectiveness of street sweeping to reduce dust re-entrainment and assess the impact of abrasives and deicers on ambient PM near an alpine lake (Lake Tahoe). The results indicate use of liquid deicers contributes less to road dust emissions than abrasives. Street sweeping was found to increase the PM10 re-entrainment rate of the remaining road dust. Emission factors for roads in the study area (a snowy mountain climate) tend to decrease significantly from late Spring to early Summer by as much as a factor of 4. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sediment traps deployed in the lake at different depths and locations were used to collect samples for calculating sediment fluxes in two years. The results show that resuspension of settled particles in the lake with a small dynamic ratio is moderate and depends on seasonal changes in thermal stratification. The rate of particle deposition during the summer stratification period was low. The weather conditions during early spring, such as air temperature and the thickness of snowcover, influence the intensity of resuspension. Air temperature and cloudiness during the summer stratification period determine the rate of bioproduction and thermocline parameters, which also have a major effect on the seston composition and fluxes.

C. Similar seasonal shifts in the CO2 compensation point, ranging from 17 .mu.l CO2/l in summer to 90 in winter, occurred in Hydrilla from 3 geographically distinct lakes in Florida. Incubation of Hydrilla and 5 other submersed angiosperm [Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum brasiliense, Cabomba caroliniana, Utricularis sp.] under a high temperature (27.degree. C day) and long photoperiod (14 h) reduced the CO2 compensation point to less than 20. A continuously high CO2 concentration of 5000 .mu.l/l (gas phase) prevented the decline in the CO2 compensation point, whereas 300 .mu.l/l induced it. Lake-grown and chamber-grown Hydrilla with low photorespiratory capacity, as determined by low CO2 compensation points, showed elevated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity (239 vs 33 .mu.mol/mg Chl per h). Diurnal gas-exchange measurements at 300 and 3000 .mu.l CO2/l (gas phase) demonstrated that low photorespiration Hydrilla exhibited net CO2 fixation in the dark at the higher CO2 levels, probably via the elevated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity. Only Hydrilla with low CO2 compensation points exhibited net dark fixation and then only during the night period. The excretion of 14C-organic compounds was only 3% of the 14CO2 light fixation rate and thus too low to account for the reduced photorespiration. The potential to alter the photosynthesis/photorespiration ratio appears ubiquitous among submersed freshwater macrophytes. This ratio change to a low photorespiratory capacity, and the induction of a dark fixation capacity, would aid the carbon economy under summer daytime conditions of low inorganic C and high O2, where photorespiratory CO2 loss would otherwise be substantial.																			0008-4026						1983	61	1					229	236		10.1139/b83-026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b83-026													WOS:A1983QE09400026

ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												To provide evidence of the inadequacy of using conventional sampling methods to study meso-zooplankton community structure in confined environments, samples from a Mediterranean meromictic coastal lake were taken using 80-mu m and 200-mu m mesh nets towed at three different depths (0-18 m). Mesh size significantly affected the description of the community structure of the collected zooplankton. The 80-mu m-mesh catch revealed for the first time in such an environment the overwhelming abundance of the copepod species Oithona brevicornis, as two orders of magnitude greater than recorded for the 200-mu m-mesh catch. The other dominant species were Paracartia latisetosa and Pseudodiaptomus marbus, which were more efficiently sampled with the 200-mu m mesh. These showed a summer abundance peak for P. latisetosa near the surface layer, and for P. marinus in the deepest stratum, close to the anoxic layer. Copepod nauplii and bivalve larvae were more efficiently caught with the 80-mu m-mesh, and accounted for most of the zooplankton in winter, and showed the highest loss percentage of abundance between the two mesh-size catches. The differences in the assemblages reflect different diversity patterns, with peaks in summer and winter for the communities collected with the 80-mu m-mesh and 200-mu m-mesh, respectively. These findings imply the need for the development of a commonly used sampling method with paired nets, to correctly take into account both the large and small fractions of the mesozooplankton in the study of closed and semi-enclosed coastal environments, and to obtain data that can be better compared across studies.

Assessing the impact of environmental exposures and Cryptosporidium infection in cattle on human incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario, Canada	PLOS ONE												Cryptosporidium is a waterborne parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans and in cattle. Risk factors for human illness include contact with surface water such as lakes and rivers, exposure to contaminated municipal drinking water, as well as zoonotic transmission from livestock and agriculture. The objectives of this study are twofold: 1) to describe the temporal distribution of cryptosporidiosis in Southwestern Ontario; and 2) to determine the distribution of human cryptosporidiosis, in relation to exposures such as cryptosporidium positive cattle farms, weather events, and hydrological factors. Seasonal trends in 214 bovine and 87 human cases were assessed using regression models that predicted monthly case counts in relation to observed monthly case counts. A case-crossover approach was used to evaluate acute associations between daily environmental exposures, such as weather, hydrology, the presence of Cryptosporidium positive cattle farms within the region, and the risk of human Cryptosporidium infection. Annual seasonality was found for both human cases and bovine cases with human cases peaking in mid-summer and bovine cases peaking in late winter to early spring. Bovine cases that occurred 21 days prior to human cases were associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of human case occurrence. At both 9 and 14 days prior to human case onset, the odds of a human case increased twofold per 10-degree Celsius increase in air temperature. These results provide a preliminary hypothesis for the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis from cattle to humans via the environment and suggest that the timing of environmental conditions in relation to case occurrence is biologically plausible.					; Greer, Amy/NUP-3089-2025	Brankston, Gabrielle/0000-0001-8601-1111; Ng, Victoria/0000-0002-7619-541X; 													1932-6203					APR 26	2018	13	4							e0196573	10.1371/journal.pone.0196573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196573								29698463					WOS:000431007600101

Each grid box is divided into fractions of different types of land use with independent solutions of the surface energy budget. An area-weighted average of the energy fluxes is computed to couple with the atmosphere, assuming the air above the surface is well blended at a given height. In the framework of validation of the tiling method, the ECMWF land surface scheme has been tested in offline mode driven by meteorological forcing provided by the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). Two contrasting surfaces in the boreal region of southern Finland are considered: a Scots pine forest (Hyytiala) and a small nearby lake (Valkea-Kotinen). The field observations are used to evaluate the land surface model simulations for both energy fluxes and reservoirs. The model is able to characterize the main difference between the two sites, which appears in the energy partitioning, explained by the lake's large thermal inertia. In fact, while a large portion of the incoming solar radiation in the forest is released as sensible heat, the lake stores a substantial amount of energy in the water during late spring and summer and releases it in autumn. The different behavior of the fluxes both on annual and diurnal time scales confirms the benefit of a tiling mechanism in the presence of large contrast. However, it is also shown that the assumption of similar conditions at the blending height introduces errors.

The percentages of soluble iron and manganese before (1983-85) and after (1986-88) artificial aeration are compared for the periods Jan-Dec, Jan-Mar, and Jun-Aug at three depths 6 m, 15 m and 0.5 m above the dam base, to assess the importance of seasonal changes in the various depths of the dam. Although aeration had an initial marked reduction in levels of soluble iron and manganese at all depths of the dam, the concentrations of these mtals showed a steady increase over succeeding years. Analysis of the figures over summer and winter periods shows that the reduction of soluble iron was maintained in summer, but not during winter. Upon aeration, the initial reduction of soluble manganese concentration was maintained in succeeding years in the epilimnic regions of the dam, but not in the hypolimnion. Statistical analysis of data has been undertaken to correlate the changes in relationship between the various forms of iron and manganese with the advent of aeration.																			0167-6369					OCT-DEC	1991	19	1-3					433	447		10.1007/BF00401331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00401331								24233959					WOS:A1991GW30800041

This outdoor study was conducted to elucidate the impacts of drought and high concentrations of N on Vallisneria spinulosa. Compared with the 60 cm water depth, the 30 cm water depth caused no difference except lower leaf weight and greater winter bud number per plant growing in the sediment from Poyang Lake. After 400 mg/L NH4+-N was added to the sediment, the leaf weight, root weight, root length, winter bud number, ramet number and stolon weight of V. spinulosa declined greatly. The high NH4+-N content in sediment increased the influence of low water depth on V. spinulosa expressed as the relatively light fresh weight per winter bud of 0.11 g. The results indicated that both a low water depth in spring and high N concentration impacted V. spinulosa and the high concentration of NH4+-N limited the adaptation of V. spinulosa to the decline in water depths. Thus, besides water-level management, nutrient control is also required to protect and restore aquatic macrophytes in Poyang Lake.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 1	2019	34	1					263	272		10.1080/02705060.2018.1559243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2018.1559243													WOS:000462641300001

The author analyzes its natural element, ecological elements, and aesthetic elements, furthermore, has explorative thinking on the continuation and development of the Three Gorges project water storage and fell away to the landscape pattern of traditional space. Mountainous watershed towns, which are the area of assembly water in the type of the mountainous river, or the parts of the valley which are surrounded by the mountainous areas. The dialectical relation between the mountainous region and valley makes its unique in space structure and landscape. For the diversity of the towns' landscape matrix, the mountainous watershed towns have more sense of the third dimension and arrangement than plain towns, and have more nimbus than ordinary mountainous towns. The area which the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are the typical mountainous watershed towns in our country. It not only has the ordinary mountainous towns' regional differentiation phenomenon on the vertical direction, but also has the stretch characteristics of horizontal corridor landscape. In 2010, the Three-Gorge project made water storage to level 175 meters successfully. There is a new characteristic landscape matrix in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River:The water has been raised in winter and the fall is more than 30 meters in the summer. High gorges are beyond the broad lake. How to make the inheritance and continuous development for the traditional landscape of the reservoir area is a question which deserves to explore deeply.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-348-1				2012	450-451		1-2				305	309		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.450-451.305	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.450-451.305													WOS:000309497800060

Seasonal shifts in community composition and proteome expression in a sulphur-cycling cyanobacterial mat	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Seasonal changes in light and physicochemical conditions have strong impacts on cyanobacteria, but how they affect community structure, metabolism, and biogeochemistry of cyanobacterial mats remains unclear. Light may be particularly influential for cyanobacterial mats exposed to sulphide by altering the balance of oxygenic photosynthesis and sulphide-driven anoxygenic photosynthesis. We studied temporal shifts in irradiance, water chemistry, and community structure and function of microbial mats in the Middle Island Sinkhole (MIS), where anoxic and sulphate-rich groundwater provides habitat for cyanobacteria that conduct both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Seasonal changes in light and groundwater chemistry were accompanied by shifts in bacterial community composition, with a succession of dominant cyanobacteria from Phormidium to Planktothrix, and an increase in diatoms, sulphur-oxidizing bacteria, and sulphate-reducing bacteria from summer to autumn. Differential abundance of cyanobacterial light-harvesting proteins likely reflects a physiological response of cyanobacteria to light level. Beggiatoa sulphur oxidation proteins were more abundant in autumn. Correlated abundances of taxa through time suggest interactions between sulphur oxidizers and sulphate reducers, sulphate reducers and heterotrophs, and cyanobacteria and heterotrophs. These results support the conclusion that seasonal change, including light availability, has a strong influence on community composition and biogeochemical cycling of sulphur and O-2 in cyanobacterial mats.

J	Do, TN; Nishida, K				Thu Nga Do; Nishida, Kei			A nitrogen cycle model in paddy fields to improve material flow analysis: the Day-Nhue River Basin case study	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS												Material flow analysis (MFA) has been applied to assess the environmental impact of human activities on nutrient flows at the river basin scale. This paper reports the enhancement of the MFA model by incorporating a nitrogen cycle model for the paddy process in the Day-Nhue River Basin, Vietnam. Dynamic transport and transformation of nitrogen in the paddy soil were quantified using the results from previous studies. All nitrogen inputs to a paddy were considered. The primary nitrogen inputs were classified as nitrate, ammonium, and organic nitrogen. The modified MFA model was used to quantify nitrogen loads from paddy fields to atmosphere, surface water, and soil/groundwater using the classified nitrogen inputs and corresponding nitrogen loss rates. This restructured paddy process significantly influenced the estimated nitrogen loads to the environment. Nitrogen loads to the air and soil/groundwater increased by 18 and 64 % in spring fields and by 0 and 25 % in summer fields, respectively. Compared with MFA that did not apply the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen load to surface water remarkably increased; it was 39 times higher for spring fields and 29 times higher for summer fields. The estimated runoff loads for the two rice seasons were in the range of measured values reported in previous studies. As a result of these calculations, it was proposed that the application of chemical fertilizer could be reduced by 50 % in both seasons to control environmental impacts without impacting rice production. The inclusion of this detailed paddy nitrogen cycle significantly enhanced the quality of the MFA model.

Vegetation variations and associated environmental changes during marine isotope stage 3 in the western part of the Chinese Loess Plateau	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This study further investigates the reported "uniqueness" of MIS 3 climatic changes in northwestern China by focusing on the MIS 3 lacustrine-wetland sequences in the western part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The lacustrine-wetland sequence at the Suancigou section documented four major environmental changes. Stratigraphic unit (i) was formed under lake-dominated environments (48,420-35,730 C-14 yr 13P), unit (ii) under wetland-dominated environments (35,730-20,480 C-14 yr BP), and unit (iii) under eolian-dominated environments (20,480-13,090 C-14 yr P-13). Unit (iv) is a fluvially-reworked eolian (loess) unit (13,090-11,450 C-14 yr BP). Pollen zone A (47,210-33,370 C-14 yr BP), representing a coniferous forest, corresponds to stratigrapbic unit (i). Zone B (33,370-28,280 C-14 yr P-13), representing a coniferous woodland landscape, and zone C (28,28022,480 14C yr 13P), representing a landscape in which coniferous woodlands alternated with steppes; correspond to unit (ii). Zone D (22,480-11,450 C-14 yr BP), representing a steppe landscape, corresponds to unit (iii) and unit (iv). We propose that the extremely wet MIS 3 was a combined result of mildly high summer insolation and constantly higher-than-normal winter insolation. That is, mildly high MIS 3 summer insolation was probably able to maintain the warmth of the ocean surface to the extent so that the Tibetan Plateau and northwestern China received an adequate supply of water-vapour. A constantly higher-than-normal MIS 3 winter insolation might have shortened the duration of the winter monsoon, so lengthening the rainy season. In addition, the soil-vegetation-air coupled feedback mechanisms under extensively well-vegetated wet conditions might have further enhanced the MIS 3 wet conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A 12-year high-resolution climatology of atmospheric water transport over the Tibetan Plateau	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS												The Tibetan Plateau (TP) plays a key role in the water cycle of high Asia and its downstream regions. The respective influence of the Indian and East Asian summer monsoon on TP precipitation and regional water resources, together with the detection of moisture transport pathways and source regions are the subject of recent research. In this study, we present a 12-year high-resolution climatology of the atmospheric water transport (AWT) over and towards the TP using a new data set, the High Asia Refined analysis (HAR), which better represents the complex topography of the TP and surrounding high mountain ranges than coarse-resolution data sets. We focus on spatiotemporal patterns, vertical distribution and transport through the TP boundaries. The results show that the mid-latitude westerlies have a higher share in summertime AWT over the TP than assumed so far. Water vapour (WV) transport constitutes the main part, whereby transport of water as cloud particles (CP) also plays a role in winter in the Karakoram and western Himalayan regions. High mountain valleys in the Himalayas facilitate AWT from the south, whereas the high mountain regions inhibit AWT to a large extent and limit the influence of the Indian summer monsoon. No transport from the East Asian monsoon to the TP could be detected. Our results show that 36.8 +/- 6.3% of the atmospheric moisture needed for precipitation comes from outside the TP, while the remaining 63.2% is provided by local moisture recycling.					; Curio, Julia/M-3533-2019; Maussion, Fabien/B-9814-2013	Scherer, Dieter/0000-0002-3670-0864; Maussion, Fabien/0000-0002-3211-506X; Curio, Julia/0000-0002-0361-9541													2190-4979	2190-4987					2015	6	1					109	124		10.5194/esd-6-109-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esd-6-109-2015													WOS:000352239700006

Despite iodine's listing by the WHO as the worlds most easily preventable cause of train damage, there is very little known about iodine cycling in terrestrial fresh waters, particularly regarding temporal changes in speciation. This study presents iodine speciation (measured by IC-ICP-MS) data from one year of monthly sampling of a dimictic humic lake in the Black Forest (Mummelsee). Total soluble iodine (TSI) levels in the Mummelsee's water column averaged 1.9 +/- 0.3 mu g L-1. Soluble organically bound iodine (SOI) accounted for the majority of TSI in the lake (85 7,16) and inflow (76 6%). SOI showed few changes throughout the year, despite stratification, anoxia in;he hypolimnion and ice cover. Iodide was lost from the epilimnion during the summer, autumn and winter, which may be related to (micro)biological uptake and sedimentation of dead organic matter. Efficient biological uptake was also suggested by a sediment core, where we found high total iodine concentrations (av. 11.8 +/- 1.7 mg kg(-1)) and a significant correlation with organic carbon content (p <0.001). In the hypolimnion a strong iodide flux was observed from the sediments into the water column during lake stratification and low DO levels. Based on I/C-org ratios in the sediment core, the iodide flux into the lake probably occurs by biological decomposition of organic material in the upper 20 cm of the sediments. Iodate levels in the epilimnion increased consistently over the year, whereas it was reduced below detection limits in the hypolimnion during anoxia. The winter turnover lead to reintroduction of oxygen into the hypolimnion and rapid formation of iodate and SOL During the turnover event, near complete loss of iodide from the water column was also observed SOI will play the largest role in iodine cycling in the Mummelsee: however. further studies are needed on the biological transformation of iodine species in freshwaters for a more complete understanding of iodine cycling.

Sangre isle Lake is a highly productive eutrophic impoundment, Sanborn Lake is a natural lake with low phytoplanktonic productivity, and Boomer Lake is an impoundment with modest productivity that is heavily affected by clay suspensoids. Although the uptake of phosphate (radiometrically determined) was rapid in each of these lakes in summer, the fate of phosphate in Boomer Lake differed from that of the others, with much of the phosphate sorbing to suspended silts and clays rather than biota (determined by isopycnic sedimentation). Recycling of phosphate from phosphomonoesters was greatest in Sangre Isle Lake, moderate in Sanborn Lake, but was undetectable in Boomer Lake. These findings suggested that high concentration of clay suspensoids influence the epilimnetic P dynamics in reservoirs and lakes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1988	45	8					1480	1486		10.1139/f88-173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-173													WOS:A1988P807100018

Sinninghe; Schouten, Stefan			Vertical and temporal variability in concentration and distribution of thaumarchaeotal tetraether lipids in Lake Superior and the implications for the application of the TEX86 temperature proxy	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												This study investigated the vertical and temporal distribution of Thaumarchaeota derived core isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids through sampling and analysis of both suspended particulate matter from the water column at different times in the annual cycle and a 3 year long record of settling particles in two sediment traps at different depths at an open lake location in Lake Superior. Results from these analyses suggest that Thaumarchaeota were present throughout the water column during times of overturning, but mainly resided below the depth of the thermocline (20-40 m) during the period of thermal stratification. Fluxes of thaumarchaeotal produced GDGTs were highly periodic and mainly occurred during two periods of the annual cycle (winter and late spring/early summer). A covariance of both branched and isoprenoid GDGT fluxes with the mass accumulation flux combined with the observation that those periods of maximum fluxes were associated with increased BIT index values, however, suggest that these two periods of elevated fluxes may be related to an influx of resuspended particles transported from shallower near shore regions of Lake Superior. During all sampling periods TEX86 inferred temperatures from SPM were in good agreement with in situ water temperatures of the depths at which the SPM was sampled. The observed range of TEX86 inferred temperatures in 3 years of settling particles is relatively small and does not show significantly higher inferred temperatures during the thermally stratified period, indicating that the sedimentary TEX86 signal during the summer thermally stratified period mainly originated from depths below the relatively shallow thermocline. Additionally, TEX86 values during the winter period of increased fluxes did not capture the decrease in water temperatures observed throughout the water column during this period, and thus may be a further indication that the thaumarchaeotal lipid flux was the result of sediment focusing. Flux-weighted TEX86 inferred temperatures from both sediment traps were in good agreement with TEX86 temperatures from surface sediments from the same location in Lake Superior. Both flux weighted TEX86 temperatures from the sediment traps and average TEX86 temperatures from surface sediments were similar to averaged measured water temperatures at below similar to 40 m depth within the error of the lacustrine TEX86 calibration. Based on the observed depths of Thaumarchaeota in the water column, TEX86 values in sediments of Lake Superior likely reflect a combination of mixed-season and sub-thermocline temperatures. This is effectively the same as the annual averaged water temperature observed at depths below 40 m in Lake Superior. Thus, trends in TEX86 inferred temperatures in sediment records of Lake Superior, and similar lakes, are likely to reflect subsurface temperature variability rather than that of surface temperatures.

Climate regulates alpine lake ice cover phenology and aquatic ecosystem structure	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												High-elevation aquatic ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change, yet relatively few records are available to characterize shifts in ecosystem structure or their underlying mechanisms. Using a long-term data set on seven alpine lakes (3126 to 3620 m) in Colorado, USA, we show that ice-off dates have shifted 7 days earlier over the past 33 years and that spring weather conditions-especially snowfall-drive yearly variation in ice-off timing. In the most well studied lake, earlier ice-off associated with increases in water residence times, thermal stratification, ion concentrations, dissolved nitrogen, pH, and chlorophyll a. Mechanistically, low spring snowfall and warm temperatures reduce summer stream flow (increasing lake residence times) but enhance melting of glacial and permafrost ice (increasing lake solute inputs). The observed links among hydrological, chemical, and biological responses to climate factors highlight the potential for major shifts in the functioning of alpine lakes due to forecasted climate change.					; Miller, Matthew/A-4928-2016	Hart, Sarah/0000-0001-8371-8568; Miller, Matthew/0000-0002-2537-1823; JOHNSON, PIETER/0000-0002-7997-5390													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 28	2016	43	10					5553	5560		10.1002/2016GL069036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL069036													WOS:000378347500106
J	CHAMBERS, PA; SPENCE, DHN; WEEKS, DC				CHAMBERS, PA; SPENCE, DHN; WEEKS, DC			PHOTOCONTROL OF TURION FORMATION BY POTAMOGETON-CRISPUS L IN THE LABORATORY AND NATURAL-WATER	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												The freshwater angiosperm P. crispus produces specialized vegetative buds, known as turions, in early summer, in contrast to their autumn production by other temperate climate species. Laboratory experiments showed that turion production by P. crispus is triggered by long days (16 h or longer) and high temperatures (16.degree. C and above) together. Long days represent a photoperiod signal apparently perceived by phytochrome. A midnight exposure to dim R [Red] light is necessary to induce turion formation in plants kept under short days, irrespective of total daily light dose. A single long day suffices to initiate turion formation. Under inductive long warm days few turions form at low photon fluence rates (whatever the total daily light dose) or at low R:FR [Far Red] ratios near 1 during the photoperiod. Rate and magnitude of turion production are greatly increased by increased photon fluence rates and R:F ratios > 1. Sucrose feeding hastens turion development, but turion initiation is not significantly altered. As predicted from experimental findings and natural lakewater photoperiods and temperatures, tursons were observed on plants in lakes studied from June until Aug. Turions were confined as predicted to approximately the upper 1.5 m depth range in lakes where R:FR ratios and photon fluences rates were inductively high. Below these depths the R:FR ratio remains high but photon fluence rate is inadequate. Laboratory and field findings concur. In north temperate waters, turions of P. crispus appear to act as summer propagules which settle and germinate by autumn, rather than as overwintering hibernaculae.																			0028-646X	1469-8137					1985	99	2					183	194		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1985.tb03648.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1985.tb03648.x													WOS:A1985ACK5400001

Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) rates were determined by measuring the rate of oxygen decrease within a triangular benthic chamber; water column oxygen demand (WOD) rates were determined using 24-hour light and dark bottles placed in situ. Results indicated that the SOD contribution to the hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rate decreased throughout the summer from about 81% to only 30% with an initially high rate due to spring algal biomass sedimentation and lower rates in late summer due to depressed oxygen levels. The WOD rate contribution increased from 19% to 70% throughout the stratified period due to the decomposition of settling algal cells. Comparing the overall volumetric summer in situ rates (0.126 mg O2/L/day) with cruise-interval depletion rates (0.365 mg O2/L/day), the in situ rates were about 300% higher. This is attributed to unaccounted oxygen sources to the hypolimnion and because the in situ rates measure the gross WOD and SOD rather than measuring the net effects they exert.																			0380-1330						1987	13	4					731	737		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71687-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71687-6													WOS:A1987M110000026

We hypothesized that this phenomenon might be linked to recruitment bottlenecks which carp overcome where environmental conditions create unstable peripheral areas that it can access for spawning and nursery habitat. To test this hypothesis, the abundance, movement and reproductive success of carp was determined in two systems of inter-connected lakes in the North American Midwest whose shallow basins frequently experience winter-hypoxia ('winterkill'). Radio-tracking demonstrated that while adult carp overwinter in deep lakes that do not winterkill, they aggressively move into winterkill-prone shallow regions in the spring to spawn. The significance of this behavior was demonstrated by ageing analyses which found that carp recruit only in interconnected shallow lakes and then only in years following severe winter hypoxia. Presumably this strategy allows carp to exploit nursery habitat that is relatively free of predators. It likely evolved in response to seasonally variable conditions in the carp's native habitat in the Ponto-Caspian region. This life history may also explain the carp's abundance in other unstable regions such as southern Australia and could potentially be exploited to control this damaging invasive.

We examined the oxygen isotope ratios (delta 18O) of aragonite shells of the cultured freshwater bivalve Corbicula sandai (Cyrenidae), a species endemic to Lake Biwa, Japan, along with the temperature and delta 18O values of water at the culture site. The delta 18O values of cultured specimen shells showed clear periodicity corresponding to the culture period; they decreased with increasing water temperature and increased with decreasing water temperature. The observed water temperatures were strongly correlated with the delta 18O values for shells minus the delta 18O values for water; the following equation for the temperature was calculated by the least-squares method. T degrees C=18.19 +/- 0.37-3.93(+/- 0.33)x(delta 18Oaragonite/VPDB-delta 18Owater/VSMOW)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$T \left(<^>\circ \text{C}\right)=18.19 \left(\pm 0.37\right)-3.93 (\pm 0.33)\times ({{\updelta }<^>{18}\text{O}}_{\text{aragonite}/\text{VPDB}}-{\updelta }<^>{18}{\text{O}}_{\text{water}/\text{VSMOW}})$$\end{document}. Using this equation, water temperatures from May 2, 2019, back to 2009 were reconstructed based on the delta 18O values of two specimens collected in the lake, then compared with the observed water temperatures at lake depths of 0.5-20 m. In the northern basin of the lake, the water temperature in the shallow layer below the top 15 m, which is the habitat depth of C. sandai, was 26-28 degrees C during the summer and 6-8 degrees C during the winter; the reconstructed water-temperature range of 12-28 degrees C agreed well with the observed higher values. The growth rates of cultured specimens significantly slowed at temperatures below 12-13 degrees C, and the reconstructed minimum-water temperature of approximately 13 degrees C indicates that the equation exhibits reliable accuracy. The growth records of the cultured specimens suggest that the reconstructed water-temperature fluctuations reflect the water temperatures from early spring (April-May) to late autumn (December).																			0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2025	73	2					127	148		10.1007/s10933-024-00351-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-024-00351-x		JAN 2025											WOS:001408521100001

However, the physical mechanism of atmospheric teleconnections with respect to regional droughts is still not fully understood. In this study, a univariate-to-multivariate analysis framework is proposed to disentangle the spatially combined and temporally lagged effects of multiple oceanicatmospheric oscillations on meteorological droughts at regional scale. Our study focuses on the largest freshwater lake basin of China, the Poyang Lake basin (PLB). Pearson's correlation coefficient and cross-wavelet transform are used to analyze the pair-wise linear and non-linear correlations between droughts and each climate oscillation. Random forests model is used to reveal the combined influences of multiple climate oscillations. The associated atmospheric mechanism for the identified combination of climate indices with changing lags is explored by performing composite analysis. Regarding the spatially combined influences, the concurrence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are the most important drought precursors. Regarding the temporally lagged influences, ENSO with lag of 11 months and NAO with lag of 2-3 months trigger meteorological droughts. The combined effect of preceding winter El Nino and late-summer negative NAO is the primary cause for triggering autumn droughts. The positive Eurasian teleconnection pattern, triggered by ENSO and NAO and favorable for anomalous northerly currents, is the main drought-prone circulation pattern for the PLB. These findings contribute to improved understanding of joint effects of lagged teleconnections for meteorological droughts, which could eventually lead to more skillful seasonal drought forecasting.

J	Shatwell, T; Köhler, J; Nicklisch, A				Shatwell, Tom; Koehler, Jan; Nicklisch, Andreas			Temperature and photoperiod interactions with silicon-limited growth and competition of two diatoms	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Diatoms often dominate temperate lakes and rivers in spring, when increasing temperature and daylength coincide with decreasing silicate concentrations. Since interactions between these factors may be important, we cultivated Stephanodiscus minutulus and Nitzschia acicularis (freshwater diatoms) under silicon limitation at different temperatures and photoperiods in continuous and batch culture. The Monod parameters of Si-limited growth indicated that S. minutulus should be superior under Si limitation. The type of interaction between silicate, temperature and photoperiod differed between species and indicated that the advantage of S. minutulus increases under low temperatures and photoperiods. Competition experiments in semicontinuous culture confirmed these predictions and were described accurately with a model of factor interactions. Multiple regression analysis of field data from a shallow eutrophic lake showed that dissolved silicate (DSi), temperature, photoperiod and total phosphorus (TP) were the most important predictors of spring centric diatom biovolume, where lower temperatures and photoperiods favour this group and higher biovolumes coincide with DSi depletion and higher TP. Pennate diatoms depended more on light, winter population size and grazer abundance. Conditions in situ suggested that factor interactions play a role during spring under strong Si limitation. We propose that the type of interaction reflects specific niche adaptation. Understanding interactions between physical factors and nutrients will increase our understanding of phytoplankton diversity and predictive accuracy of phytoplankton dynamics including combined effects of climate and trophic change.

Despite striking seasonal differences of environmental conditions the erythrocyte numbers remained constant during the year. Lymphocytes, however, displayed a distinct seasonal pattern with low abundance during the period of ice-cover (about 7 months) and high abundance in summer. During winter the circulating blood contained lymphocytes with damaged organelles and membranes, and almost exclusively mature red cells with a high density. With rising water temperature in July/August (11 degreesC), however, high-density (old) cells almost disappeared, the proportion of immature cells dramatically increased, and the capacity to responding to handling stress decreased. We conclude that in summer the accelerated erythropoiesis (recruitment of red blood cells) compensates for the reduced lifespan of red blood cells.

Distribution and abundance of larval lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in Stokes Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) have been widely studied across the Laurentian Great Lakes. However, there are major gaps in our understanding of factors that affect larval distribution and abundance. The goal of this study was to investigate the distribution and abundance of larval lake whitefish in a Great Lakes embayment using Stokes Bay, Lake Huron as a case study. We collected plankton samples and environmental data from mid-spring to early summer during 2011 and 2012. Ichthyoplankton tows in 2011 revealed densities that are among the highest to be reported in Great Lakes studies. Overall there was little relationship between environmental variables (temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and depth) and larval lake whitefish distribution and abundance. Ichthyoplankton tows in 2012 revealed a virtual absence of larval lake whitefish during the entire sampling season; unseasonably warm conditions during spring 2012 likely had an important effect on larval survival.

The conservation of this iconic species is an international priority but requires knowledge of how monarchs interact with the landscape during different stages of the annual cycle. To better understand habitat needs of monarchs departing their core breeding range in southern Ontario, Canada, we examined how various landscape features influenced roost site selection during fall migration-an instrumental resource link between the breeding and wintering grounds. Using dedicated fall migration surveys along the Great Lakes coastlines and a citizen science dataset collected across all of Ontario, we evaluated the relationship between roost site occupancy and 18 landscape variables using a boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling approach. Results suggest that a closer distance to the Great Lakes, increased goldenrod Solidago spp. cover, moderate forest cover, rural road cover, and urban land cover are all important to roosting site selection. Our research provides important insights into the habitat characteristics of stopover sites, which will help guide future investigations and conservation actions to preserve monarch butterflies and their migratory phenomenon.																			1863-5407	1613-4796				APR 19	2023	50						267	277		10.3354/esr01235	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/esr01235													WOS:001447585100006

The influence of Lake Erie on changes in temperature and frost dates	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Anthropogenic climate change is affecting virtually all ecosystems across the globe. Some of the noticeable effects of the changing climate are the shifting of frost dates in the fall and spring, and how warm temperatures are distributed throughout the year. The degree to which an ecosystem is affected by these changes depends upon many factors, including where the ecosystem is located and what regional variabilities in climate surround that ecosystem. One ecosystem that experiences a unique microclimate is the region surrounding Lake Erie, the southernmost Laurentian Great Lake. Using historic climate data dating from 1948 to 2017, we set out to determine how changes in temperature and frost dates differ between the coastal and inland regions of the southern coast of Lake Erie, and to hypothesize as to why these effects may be occurring differently between these regions. We found that, for both coastal and inland regions, the first frost in the fall has begun later, while the last frost in the spring has begun earlier, leading to both regions experiencing longer frost-free seasons. However, although both regions have experienced these shifts, the rate at which these shifts occurred differed between the coastal and inland regions. The average date that the frost events occurred also differs between the two regions. It was also found that average temperatures have been increasing for each region, primarily in coastal regions, due to increased minimum temperatures over time. The results from this study highlight the importance of regional climate variability in large-scale climatic studies.

R. China, and provides critical breeding and staging habitats for waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and the Central Asian Flyway. It also provides livelihoods for local communities through fishing, reed harvesting and tourism. Balancing conservation and economic use of the lake requires a thorough understanding of the dynamics of waterbird communities. From April 2011 to March 2012, we conducted a monthly waterbird survey on the lake, and counted more than 165,900 individuals which belonged to 87 species, 14 families and six orders. There were significant temporal differences in species richness and abundance. The highest migration activities of the birds were recorded in May and August. Shallow water and open water areas were mostly used by waterbirds with over 50% of the species, and a population density of 1,000 individuals per km2 recorded. Human use of the wetland mainly consists of fishing, tourism and reed harvesting, which may have a significant impact on waterbirds. The most intensive human activities occurred in July and August, in open water and shallow water. An adaptive management plan to reduce the negative impact of fishing and tourism activities in summer and autumn, to rationalise reed harvesting in winter and to control eutrophication are critical management measures in addressing threats to the ecological characters of the site.

Intersexual variation in the seasonal behaviour and depth distribution of a freshwater temperate fish, the largemouth bass	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Because fish are poikilothermic, water temperature is regarded as a primary factor influencing their activity and behaviour. Rarely have field Studies been conducted with the spatiotemporal resolution to enable rigorous quantitative assessments of that relationship. Furthermore, there have been few Studies that have considered the influence of sex on the seasonal behaviour of fish. Twenty largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede, 1802)) were implanted with coded acoustic telemetry transmitters and remotely tracked in near real time in a small lake in Ontario, Canada, via it whole-lake hydrophone array between I November 2004 and 30 September 2005. Fish inhabited the deepest waters and were least active during the winter months Under ice. During the warmest months, fish were most active and inhabited the littoral zone. Sex-specific differences were noted year-round. Reproductive males were less active and inhabited shallower depths during the spawning and post-reproductive periods. Reproductive males inhabited the deepest depths during winter and fall, with nonreproductive males at the shallowest depths. Throughout the year, the behaviour of nonreproductive males and females was similar. While differences in behaviour of bass are primarily driven by water temperature, sex and reproductive Status play important roles year-round, especially during and after the reproductive period.

For this purpose experiments were conducted in four different enclosures (Potamogeton maackianus enclosure-PE, Vallisneria spinulosa enclosure-VE, manipulated enclosure-ME and aquaculture enclosure-AE). A sediment trap method was employed and the experiments were conducted from summer to winter in a shallow freshwater lake located in central China. A total of 813, 1277, 613 and 693 g DW m(-2) of sediment was resuspended in VE, AE, ME and PE, respectively. Our results showed that P. maackianus was more effective than V spinulosa in restraining sediment resuspension. Macrophytes reached their maximum effectiveness of reducing resuspension at a certain species-specific biomass threshold above which biomass effects on resuspension were negligible. The threshold biomass was estimated as 300 g m-2 for P. maackianus. Accordingly, within a lake management and aquaculture aspect, we conclude that as long as biomass does not fall below this threshold its consumption will not influence sediment resuspension. In the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River macrophyte coverage protects the lake sediment against adverse effects of monsoon wind; if the vegetation is eroded aquaculture sediment resuspension increases significantly.

J	Vanoverbeke, J; De Meester, L				Vanoverbeke, Joost; De Meester, Luc			Within season short-term hatching delays suggest risk-spreading behaviour in populations of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia	ECOSCIENCE												Many organisms produce dormant stages, building up large germ banks in the sediments. Timing of emergence from these germ banks is a key feature in the recurrent cycle of dormant and active life stages. We exposed dormant egg bank samples of Daphnia magna from (semi-)permanent ponds to seasonal cues mimicking temperature and photoperiod during early spring, late spring, and summer in the region of sampling and investigated hatching success and response time after incubation. Whereas no differences in hatching success were observed between seasonal treatments, within each seasonal treatment a variable fraction of eggs postponed the hatching response for several days. We link immediate versus short-term delayed hatching to a trade-off between the advantages of quick niche Filling and the unpredictability of reproductive success under unstable environmental conditions. A scenario where hatching investment is spread over immediate and delayed hatchers as a bet-hedging strategy is corroborated by environmental data on the risk of abortive hatching in early spring and by modeling results that show that immediate versus short-term delayed hatching is a valid alternative to bet-hedging over years in the investigated habitats to cope with variability in the onset of favourable conditions.

In the vicinity of Villafafila lakes, local fresh and brackish regional groundwaters feeds the lakes, forming a brine in the lake sediments aquitard. Two TDEM surveys (summer 2019 and winter 2020) were carried out. Five TDEM soundings were acquired at the same location for each survey, forming a profile from the hills to the lake-shore. Simultaneously to the TDEM surveys, electric conductivity of lake water and groundwater was measured. The resistivity boundary between the local fresh (10-35 Ohm/m) and regional brackish groundwater (2-5 Ohm/m) is well marked at 600 m above sea level (masl) below the hills, and at 650 masl below the lowlands surrounding the lakes. During the summer, fresh-brackish groundwater interphase rises due to evaporative pumping occurring in the lowlands. This increases groundwater salinity close to the terrain surface favoring precipitation of halite efflorescences. Annual record of EC in a piezometer confirms the summer ascendant of the brine contained in the lake aquitard. TDEM sounding is fast and simple technique to monitor seasonal variations in fresh-brackish groundwater interphase and to detect possible salinization of consumption wells and environmental changes.

A long-term cooling trend in summer temperatures, marked by gradual temperate and humid forest decline, parallels cooling in Greenland and the decrease of mid-latitude summer insolation reduction until at least 2000 cal. yr BP. At the long-term scale, the lowering in seasonal contrast revealed by vegetation changes follows the increase of precession. Corylus woodlands spread at the expense of deciduous Quercus forest, between 8740 and 8390 cal. yr BP, linked with the high seasonality conditions that, counterbalancing the long-term astronomical forcing trend, were amplified by the north Atlantic high-latitudes winter sea-ice expansion. High seasonality conditions resulted from the Agassiz and Ojibway final outburst episodes and consequent gradual reduction of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). Between 8390-8060 cal. yr BP, a sudden Corylus woodland decline marks the 8.2 kyr cold event in northwestern France probably triggered by the severe MOC reduction leading to the additional drop in winter temperature over Europe and Greenland. Nonetheless, seasonality remains high during this interval. The high seasonality conditions detected in 'VK03-58Bis' between 8740 and 8060 cal. yr BP reflects the multicentennial-scale climate cooling 8.6-8.0 kyr episode of the North Atlantic. Following the Agassiz and Ojibway final outburst episodes, climate became more stable. However, millennial-scale climate cooling episodes are recorded in 'VK03-Bis' and are characterized by weak winter cooling and increases in precipitation. Furthermore, dinocyst analysis and benthic gastropod Turritella communis occurrences indicate regional changes such as the southward migration of the Boreal biogeographical zone between 8740 and 8480 cal. yr BP and the subsequent opening of the English Channel at around 8480-8390 cal. yr BP.

Annual length increments for eels less than 500 mm were 13 mm and 15 mm for shortfinned and longfinned eels, respectively. Shortfinned eels grew at rates of between 2 and 6 mm per month in summer (December 1984-March 1985), and older eels (10-15 years) grew faster than younger eels in autumn (March-June) (5.0-6.5 mm per month). There was a decline in the mean length of most age classes of shortfinned eel samples taken in July and October. This was probably a result of shrinkage during winter, compounded by the annual formation of new hyaline rings in otoliths during September-October, which lowered mean length-at-age. Backwater shortfinned eels younger than 20 years were smaller than shortfinned eels from nearby Lake Waikare, and backwater longfinned eels younger than 17 years grew slower than those from the Waikato River mainstem. Mean condition of backwater shortfinned eels (CF = 1.97) was similar to the condition of shortfinned eels from Lake Waikare. The mean condition of backwater longfinned eels (CF = 2.28) was similar to that of longfinned eels fron the Waikato River mainstem.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1989	23	4					459	465		10.1080/00288330.1989.9516382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1989.9516382													WOS:A1989CQ09700002

ABUNDANCE AND OCCURRENCE OF COMMON BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS (TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS) IN THREE ESTUARIES OF THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO	GULF AND CARIBBEAN RESEARCH												Current abundance estimates for populations of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu, 1821) in bays, sounds, and estuaries are lacking throughout most of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (GOM), including areas of Texas and western Louisiana. To address this issue, we conducted 92 small-boat photographic identification surveys covering similar to 2000 km(2) and comprising similar to 11,000 km of track-line in winter and summer seasons in West Bay, TX (2014-2015, n = 25), the Galveston Bay, TX system (2016, n = 50), Sabine Lake, TX (2017, n = 17), and adjacent coastal waters. Individual dolphin encounter histories were constrained by spatiotemporal parameters to approximately represent 1) a "Bay" estimate of individuals limited to the interior of each embayment, and 2) a "Selective" estimate of the number of individuals in each survey area (including nearshore coastal waters), filtered for potential transient dolphins. Using the Selective dataset, estimated bottlenose dolphins (95% CI) were (winter and summer, respectively) 38 (29-47) and 37 (33-40) for West Bay, 842 (694-990) and 1,132 (846-1,417) for Galveston Bay, and 122 (73-170) and 162 (114-210) for Sabine Lake. A range of 4-15% of marked individuals in each study area were identified as inter-bay matches. These results provide new insights on the potential spatial range of each population, update previous abundance estimates for West Bay and Galveston Bay, and contribute novel population information for Sabine Lake and adjacent coastal waters of the northwestern GOM.

The diet comprised a total of 70% by weight of rockling and wrasse (Labridae) in almost equal quantities. Eel Anguilla anguilla, sea scorpion (Cottidae), blenny (Blenniidae) and Mollusca all contributed 3-8%. Minor items included other littoral/sublittoral fish and invertebrates, some of which may have been present in the guts of prey fish. Rockling and wrasse are considered preferred prey and were consumed more often on Inishmore, where shores are more exposed and there is less sand than on the mainland. Eel, however, was eaten less often on Inishmore, presumably because of an absence of freshwater run-off Many of the eels and most of the three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus were probably caught in brackish lakes. Seasonal variation in prey included a rise in consumption of wrasse in winter, probably because they are then semi-torpid amongst rocks, as well as a fall in eels (which in winter bury themselves in sediment), blennies, butterfish Pholis gunnellus and conger eel Conger conger. The sea urchin Parcentrotus lividus is eaten most often in winter, when the gonads are largest and firmest.																			0791-7945					DEC	1999	99B	3					173	182																WOS:000166348000001
J	DICKMAN, M				DICKMAN, M			LAKE SEDIMENT MICROLAMINAE AND ANNUAL MORTALITIES OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC BACTERIA IN AN OLIGOMICTIC LAKE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A novel mechanism of microlamina formation in oligomictic lakes is proposed. During spring and summer in Zaca Lake, an oligomictic lake in Santa Barbara, California [USA], a light-colored microlamina is formed. During winter, a mass mortality of sulphur-rich phototrophic bacteria occurs following the ventilation of the chemocline or the overturn of the lake. When this occurs, oxygen is introduced into the chemocline killing most of the anaerobic bacteria. When these sulphur-laden bacteria die and settle to the bottom of the lake, they form a black microlamina which is rich in ferrous monosulphides. 2. The varved stratigraphy of the Zaca Lake sediment core presents an opportunity to correlate stratigraphic events in the lake''s varved sediments with events reported for its catchment over the last 200 years. 3. Colonization by Europeans dates back to the 1760s, making this one of the best-documented histories for a small lake in North America. A number of events have been correlated with stratigraphic information from the lake''s varved cores. 4. Eutrophic diatom indicator species disappear downcore, where they are replaced by meso- and oligotrophic indicators. In addition, pollen from exotic trees planted in the lake''s catchment appears at specific core depths associated with their pollen production stage.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1987	18	1					151	164		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01303.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01303.x													WOS:A1987J392100013

Temporal and spatial variability of an invasive toxigenic protist in a North American subtropical reservoir	HARMFUL ALGAE												The toxigenic marine flagellate Prymnesium parvum was first recorded in Lake Texoma, OK-TX, USA, an impoundment of the Red and Washita Rivers, following a massive fish kill in January 2004. Results of a 4.5-year monitoring program, spanning five bloom periods, revealed that Prymnesium abundances in the lake were temporally and spatially variable-densities were higher in winter, near-shore, and in Red River-associated sampling sites; the largest blooms were in Lebanon Pool, a large backwater basin often disconnected from the main reservoir. Prymnesium blooms appeared to have been fueled by high nutrient concentrations, and winter-spring densities were positively correlated with chlorophyll a, conductivity, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and microzooplankton biomass, and negatively correlated with molar total nitrogen:total phosphorus and cladoceran and total crustacean zooplankton biomass. Comparison of Prymnesium densities with hydrological data suggested that Prymnesium blooms in Lebanon Pool were highest when the pool was disconnected from the main reservoir; no bloom occurred in the winter of 2004-2005, the only year since the 2003-2004 invasion in which Lebanon Pool and Lake Texoma were connected during the winter months.

HIGH PREVALENCE OF THE COPEPOD SALMINCOLA CALIFORNIENSIS IN STEELHEAD TROUT IN LAKE ONTARIO FOLLOWING ITS RECENT INVASION	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Salmincola californiensis (Dana, 1853) (Subclass Copepoda: Family Lernaeopodidae) is known to parasitize salmonids of the genus Oncorhynchus including Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout), Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (chinook salmon), and Oncorhynchus kisutch (coho salmon). These salmonids have been introduced to the Great Lakes intermittently since the mid-1800s. As we demonstrate here, the introduction of these salmonids to the Great Lakes was followed, at some point, by the introduction of their parasitic gill copepod, S. californiensis. Given anecdotal accounts of S. californiensis in introduced salmonids in Lake Ontario since 2012, we chose to conduct a survey formally document the occurrence of this introduced species. Our survey took place during spring, summer, and fall of 2018 and during spring of 2019 at the south-eastern side of Lake Ontario. Prevalence of S. californiensis was 69, with a mean intensity of 2.7 in 61 rainbow trout examined in 2018. In 2019, prevalence of S. californiensis was 71, with a mean intensity of 3.6 in 59 rainbow trout examined. The prevalence of S. californiensis was 39, with a mean intensity of 1.6 in 223 chinook salmon examined in 2018. No specimens of S. californiensis were found in the 100 coho salmon examined in 2018. The prevalence of S. californiensis in rainbow trout is of great concern considering that it is double that found in rainbow trout in the native range (69 [in 2018] and 71 [in 2019] vs. 35). This is the first formal documentation of the invasion of S. californiensis in Lake Ontario. Future fisheries management decisions in Lake Ontario and its tributaries should take into account these data.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				JAN	2020	106	1					198	200		10.1645/19-121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/19-121								32097104					WOS:000552901300021

The residual concentrations of trichlorobiphenyls (tri-CBs, PCB 18) and tetra-CBs (PCB 52) in water were significantly higher than those of penta-CBsto deca-CBs, and the average residual concentration of PPCBs (sum of 14 PCB congeners) in summer was about six times higher than in autumn. However, the residues in sediment did not change significantly. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that channel morphology and the corresponding environmental indices had significant impacts on PCB residues and their composition profiles in water and sediment. The overflow weir and lake-type watercourse may remarkably reduce the residual concentration and ecological risks of PCBs in water. The highest reduction percentages of the residual concentration and ecological risks of PPCBs induced by an overflow weir were 78% and 67%, respectively, and those induced by a lake-type watercourse were 36% and 70%, respectively. The watercourses with different channel morphologies were ranked by residual PPCBs concentrations in the following descending order: the natural ecological watercourse, vertical concrete watercourse, and vegetation-type riprap watercourse. However, they were ranked by residual PPCBs concentrations in sediment in the following descending order: the vertical concrete watercourse, vegetation-type riprap watercourse, and natural ecological watercourse.

Urban parks function as natural biofilters, and examining the factors influencing dust retention-specifically PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations-across different spatial scales can enhance air quality and resident well-being. This study investigates the factors affecting dust retention in urban parks at both the site and vegetation community scales, focusing on Xi'an Expo Park. Through on-site measurements and a land use regression (LUR) model, the spatial and temporal distributions of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were analyzed. The indications of the findings are as follows. (1) The LUR model effectively predicts factors influencing PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at the site scale, with adjusted R2 values ranging from 0.482 to 0.888 for PM2.5 and 0.505 to 0.88 for PM10. Significant correlations were found between particulate matter concentrations and factors such as the distance from factories, sampling area size, distance from main roads, presence of green spaces, and extent of hard pavements. (2) At the plant community scale, half-closed (30%-70% canopy cover), single-layered green spaces demonstrated the superior regulation of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. Specifically, two vegetation structures-the half-closed single-layered mixed broadleaf-conifer woodland (H1M) and the half-closed single-layered broad-leaved woodland (H1B)-exhibited the highest dust-retention capacities. (3) PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were highest in winter, followed by spring and autumn, with the lowest levels recorded in summer. Daily particulate matter concentrations peaked between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. and gradually decreased, reaching a minimum between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of urban green spaces on particulate matter (PM) concentrations across multiple scales. By identifying and synthesizing key indicators at these various scales, the research aims to develop effective design strategies for urban green spaces and offer a robust theoretical framework to support the creation of healthier cities. This multi-scale perspective deepens our understanding of how urban planning and landscape architecture can play a critical role in mitigating air pollution and promoting public health.

Large summer striped bass kills, however, are rare. The objective of this study was to determine the summer temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in habitat used by striped bass in Lake Norman. We tagged 48 striped bass (2.2-7.8 kg) with temperature-sensing radio tags (40-50 MHz) during spring 1992 and 1993. Tag frequency, tag temperature, location, and a water column temperature/DO profile were recorded for each tag encounter. Mean tag temperatures (25.6 and 26.1 C) and associated mean DO concentrations (4.0 and 3.1 mg/liter) were similar for large (greater than or equal to 4.5 kg) and small (<4.5 kg) striped bass in the warmest weeks of summer 1992. Habitat less than or equal to 28.0 C and containing greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/liter DO was always present in most of Lake Norman both years. No striped bass mortalities attributed solely to environmental conditions were observed. We suggest DO greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/liter and water temperature less than or equal to 27.0 C will prevent summer striped bass mortalities in Lake Norman. Water temperatures up to 28.0 C can be tolerated, but the exposure period must be <4 weeks to avoid mortalities.																									1996							91	97																WOS:000073965500008

PCB concentrations in the plankton of the entire water column varied seasonally by ten times, with the highest values occurring in spring, lowest during summer and variable levels in late fall. The lower PCB levels in the total summer community coincide with a reduced biomass in certain size fractions in the Bay rather than a decrease in PCB concentration of the plankton. PCBs were concentrated in the middle-sized fractions of the planktonic community and this is attributed to the greater biomass present in these categories, PCB concentrations in plankton were most highly correlated with their lipid content at the time of sampling. Seasonal reductions of lipid in the plankton per m(3) resulted in a higher concentration of PCB per unit lipid in the remaining community. Planktonic PCB concentrations, expressed on a lipid basis, are found to be correlated with cumulative rainfall 21 d before sampling for both years combined. Adult fish were more contaminated by PCBs than either their egg or juvenile stages. Mature gaspereau, herring and smelt had higher concentrations of PCB contamination than mackerel, capelin, white bake and silversides. No difference was found between PCB contamination of the sexes of fish species analyzed. PCBs were transferred from mother to offspring in fish, but at lower levels than the level present in the parent; and the maximum accumulation from the environment occurred between immature and adult fish. The best predictors of PCB contamination in fish in St. Georges Bay are lipid content followed by size and age.																			0304-4203	1872-7581				MAR	1997	56	3-4					145	179																WOS:A1997WQ30000002
J	Ejankowski, W; Lenard, T				Ejankowski, Wojciech; Lenard, Tomasz			The effect of ice phenology exerted on submerged macrophytes through physicochemical parameters and the phytoplankton abundance	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The physicochemical parameters of water, the concentration of chlorophyll-a and the submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) were studied to evaluate the effects of different winter seasons on the biomass of macrophytes in shallow eutrophic lakes. We hypothesised that a lack of ice cover or early ice-out can influence the physicochemical parameters of water and thus change the conditions for the development of phytoplankton and SAV. The studies were conducted in four lakes of the Western Polesie region in mid-eastern Poland after mild winters with early ice-out (MW, 2011 and 2014) and after cold winters with late ice-out (CW, 2010, 2012 and 2013). The concentrations of soluble and total nitrogen, chlorophyll-a and the TN:TP ratio in the lakes were considerably higher, whereas the concentration of soluble and total phosphorus and water transparency were significantly lower after the MW compared with after the CW. No differences were found in water temperature, reaction and electrolytic conductivity. Low water turbidity linked with low concentration of chlorophyll-a after the CW resulted in increased water transparency and the total biomass of the SAV. The negative effect of the MW on the macrophyte species was stronger on more sensitive species (Myriophyllum spicatum, Stratiotes aloides) compared with shade tolerant Ceratophyllum demersum. Our findings show that the ice cover phenology affected by climate warming can change the balance between phytoplankton and benthic vegetation in shallow eutrophic lakes, acting as a shift between clear and turbid water states. We speculate that various responses of macrophyte species to changes in the water quality after two winter seasons (CW and MW) could cause alterations in the vegetation biomass, particularly the expansion of shade tolerance and the decline of light-demanding species after a series of mild winters.

Recovery of the fish community and changes in the lower trophic levels in a eutrophic lake after a winter kill of fish	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th Shallow Lakes Congress 2008	NOV 23-28, 2008	Punta del Este, URUGUAY					A severe oxygen deficit induced a fish kill in the eutrophicated two-basin Lake A"imajarvi in southern Finland during winter 2002-2003, resulting in cascading effects on the lower trophic levels of the lake. Pikeperch disappeared from the lake and bleak and white bream decreased to low numbers. The recovery of the populations of other species started immediately when strong year-classes of roach and perch appeared in summer 2003 and onwards. A sharp increase in the growth of perch and roach was recorded, and perch became the dominant fish species during 2004-2006. Consequent responses after the fish kill included increased Secchi depth, expansion of submerged macrophytes, decreased nutrient concentrations and reduction of Cyanophyta from the more eutrophic northern basin of the lake, and a temporary increase in the size of Daphnia in the early summer 2003. However, the ecosystem of the lake returned gradually to the earlier structure and level of eutrophication. Bluegreen algae have returned since 2005, the water has become more turbid, macrophytes declined in 2007 and the fish community was again dominated by small cyprinid fishes in 2008.

J	Gerson, JR; Driscoll, CT; Roy, KM				Gerson, Jacqueline R.; Driscoll, Charles T.; Roy, Karen M.			Patterns of nutrient dynamics in Adirondack lakes recovering from acid deposition	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												With decreases in acid deposition, nitrogen : phosphorus (N:P) ratios in lakes are anticipated to decline, decreasing P limitation of phytoplankton and potentially changing current food web dynamics. This effect could be particularly pronounced in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, a historic hotspot for effects of acid deposition. In this study, we evaluate spatial patterns of nutrient dynamics in Adirondack lakes and use these to infer potential future temporal trends. We calculated Mann-Kendall tau correlations among total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in 52 Adirondack Long Term Monitoring (ALTM) program lakes using samples collected monthly during 2008-2012. We evaluated the hypothesis that decreased atmospheric N and S deposition will decrease P limitation in freshwater ecosystems historically impacted by acidification. We also compared these patterns among lake watershed characteristics (i.e., seepage or lacking a surface outlet, chain drainage, headwater drainage, thin glacial till, medium glacial till). We found that correlations (P < 0.05) were highly dependent upon the different hydrologic flowpaths of seepage vs. drainage lakes. Differentiations among watershed till depth were also important in determining correlations due to water interaction with surficial geology. Additionally, we found low NO3-: TP (N: P mass) values in seepage lakes (2.0 in winter, 1.9 in summer) compared to chain drainage lakes (169.4 in winter, 49.5 in summer) and headwater drainage lakes (97.0 in winter, 10.9 in summer), implying a high likelihood of future shifts in limitation patterns for seepage lakes. With increasing DOC and decreasing NO3- concentrations coinciding with decreases in acid deposition, there is reason to expect changes in nutrient dynamics in Adirondack lakes. Seepage lakes may become N-limited, while drainage lakes may become less P-limited, both resulting in increased productivity. Long-term measurements of TP and chlorophyll a from the Adirondacks are needed to inform how future decreases in atmospheric N and S deposition will influence the trophic status of lake ecosystems throughout the region.

Seasonal and Episodic Lake Mixing Stimulate Differential Planktonic Bacterial Dynamics	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Yuan Yang Lake (YYL), Taiwan, experiences both winter and typhoon-initiated mixing, and each type of mixing event is characterized by contrasting environmental conditions. Previous work suggested that after typhoon mixing, bacterial communities in YYL reset to a pioneer composition and then follow a predictable trajectory of change until the next typhoon. Our goal was to continue this investigation by observing bacterial community change after a range of mixing intensities, including seasonal winter mixing. We fingerprinted aquatic bacterial communities in the epilimnion and hypolimnion using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and then assessed community response using multivariate statistics. We found a significant linear relationship between water column stability and the epilimnion to hypolimnion divergences. In comparison to the summer, we found the winter community had a distinct composition and less variation. We divided the bacterial community into population subsets according to abundance (rare, common, or dominant) and occurrence (transient or persistent) and further explored the contribution of these subsets to the overall community patterns. We found that transient taxa did not drive bacterial community patterns following weak typhoon mixing events, but contributed substantially to patterns observed following strong events. Common taxa generally did not follow the community trajectory after weak or strong events. Our results suggest intensity, frequency, and seasonality jointly contribute to aquatic bacterial response to mixing disturbance.

The zooplankton is a key link in the transfer of energy from primary producers up through aquatic food webs. Previous efforts to quantify the importance of basal resources to aquatic consumers have used stable isotopes (SI) and simple ternary models, including only 'bulk' phytoplankton, bacteria or terrestrial particulate organic matter (t-POM). 2. We used a novel Bayesian mixing model based on fatty acids (FA) to quantify the dietary assimilation of seven basal resources, including five phytoplankton groups, pelagic bacteria and t-POM, to Cladocera in large boreal lakes in Finland. To account for trophic enrichment of FA from the diet to consumers, we parameterised the model with a resource library, from many feeding trials, consisting of Daphnia magna fed 22 diverse basal taxa. 3. The results of the feeding trials show that the distinctive FA profiles of algal groups are transferred to consumers. Moreover, the large number of FA variables (n = 22) used in the model avoids the limitations of underdetermined mixing problems, common to SI modelling, in cases when the number of resources outnumbers the tracer variables. 4. We show that cladocerans were generally supported by phytoplankton (86-94%), with little use of t-POM (1-9%) and bacteria (1-3%). Cladocerans used primarily high-quality phytoplankton (cryptophytes, diatoms and dinoflagellates) in both summer (51 +/- 22%) and autumn (79 +/- 12%), and the relative importance of medium-quality resources (cyanobacteria, chlorophytes and chrysophytes) declined from 37 +/- 23% in the summer to 8 +/- 2% in the autumn. 5. High-quality resources, rich in essential biochemical compounds, are critical in fuelling food webs in large lakes, even those with high concentrations of allochthonous organic matter.					; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010	Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337; Hiltunen, Minna/0000-0002-0003-3000; Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863; Peltomaa, Elina/0000-0002-2858-8358; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2014	59	9					1902	1915		10.1111/fwb.12394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12394													WOS:000339480500010

Biologically, the lake is highly variable; this is due mainly to large interannual variation in fish recruitment. Bacterioplankton production tvas low during winter, typically 1-3 x 10(7) cells l(-1) h(-1), and high during summer, albeit greatly fluctuating with maximum rates typically ranging from 60 to 90 x 10(7) cells l(-1) h(-1) (or 0.4 to 0.6 mg C l(-1) day(-1)). Less pronounced variations were found in bacterioplankton abundance, which typically ranged from 3-8 x 10(9) cells l(-1) in winter to 15-30 x 10(9) cells l(-1) during summer. The specific growth rate of bacterioplankton varied from 0.02-0.2 d(-1) in winter to 0.5-2.3 day(-1) during summer. Interpolated mean bacterioplankton production, in terms of carbon, ranged from 0.08 to 0.16 mg C l(-1) day(-1), corresponding to 1.6-5.5% of the phytoplankton production, while biomass ranged from 0.28 to 0.36 mg C l(-1), corresponding to 1.9-4.6% of the phytoplankton biomass. We conducted regression analysis, relating the bacterioplankton variables to a number of environmental variables, and evaluated the interannual parameter variability. Chlorophyll a and phytoplankton production contributed less to the variation in the bacterioplankton variables than in most previous analyses using data from less eutrophic systems. We suggest that the proportion of phytoplankton production that is channelized through bacterioplankton in lakes decreases with increasing trophic state and decreasing mean depth. This probably reflects a concurrent increase in fish predation on macrozooplankton and loss by sedimentation. An important part of the residual Variation in the equations hitherto proposed in the literature could be explained by variation in macrozooplankton biomass and pH > 10.2. A negative effect of high pH on bacterioplankton production was confirmed by laboratory experiments. The impact of different zooplankton varies considerably, with Daphnia seeming to have a negative impact on bacterioplankton abundance and, thereby, indirectly on bacterioplankton production, while Bosmina, rotifers, and cyclopoid copepods seem to stimulate both abundance and production. Bosmina apparently also stimulate the bacterioplankton specific growth rate.

Here, we investigated in Lake Trasimeno (Central Italy) the diet of the invasive Dreissena polymorpha and the native Anodonta anatina. delta N-15 and delta C-13 stable isotopes were measured in winter and summer in bivalves, phytoplankton, and sedimentary organic matter (SOM); the relative dietary contributions of the two resources were determined using Bayesian mixing models. To elucidate the different carbon and nitrogen pools characterizing the study site, isotopic analyses were extended to zooplankton and to representatives of the benthic flora and macroinvertebrate fauna. Independently from the season, the two bivalves showed a limited trophic overlap, as mixing models indicated for D. polymorpha a diet based primarily on phytoplankton, while A. anatina relied mainly on SOM. Dietary differences were less marked in summer, when comparable isotopic values characterized phytoplankton and SOM. In winter, conversely, the trophic differentiation between the two species was more evident, and corresponded with a significant enrichment in SOM delta C-13 values, likely due to a substantial contribution of carbon deriving from decaying macrophytes. Whether differences in ecological and behavioral traits alone can explain the observed trophic segregation between the two species, or if they have actively shifted their diet to reduce competition for food is discussed. We conclude emphasizing the need of an advanced resolution of the influence of non-indigenous species on the flux of energy and matter in invaded lentic systems, including Lake Trasimeno.

Spoonhead sculpin (Cottus ricei) was collected upstream and downstream of a large bleached-kraft pulp mill on the Athabasca River, Alberta, Canada, during fall and spring periods to determine whether small, sedentary fish species demonstrate responses reflecting local exposure conditions. During the fall sampling period, exposed fish were older and larger than upstream fish and showed increases in condition, gonad size, egg weight, liver weight, and hepatic mixed function oxygenase activity (7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase [EROD]). Sculpin collected from the opposite river bank, where exposure was reduced, showed condition factors, gonad size, egg weight, liver weight, and EROD activity that were not significantly different from reference sites or intermediate between reference and downstream values. In the spring after a prolonged overwinter exposure to higher effluent concentrations, exposed fish were larger, showed increased size-at-age, condition, liver weight, ovary size, and EROD activity. Far-field collections showed that most responses persisted downstream for at least 48 km. The general response of exposed spoonhead sculpin was consistent with a nutrient enrichment effect described in studies investigating water quality, algal growth, and benthos communities at this site but also may be related to reduced competition associated with the loss of older fish observed in the spring. The use of small species for sentinel monitoring provided a viable alternative to use of larger, more mobile species.					; Munkittrick, Kelly/AAB-8929-2019	Taylor, William/0000-0001-8555-945X; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				NOV	1998	17	11					2227	2237		10.1002/etc.5620171113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620171113													WOS:000076537200013

Early treatment is key to controlling Phragmites, therefore a map of the current distribution is needed. ALOS PALSAR imagery was used to produce the first basin-wide distribution map showing the extent of large, dense invasive Phragmites-dominated habitats in wetlands and other coastal ecosystems along the U.S. shore of the Great Lakes. PALSAR is a satellite imaging radar sensor that is sensitive to differences in plant biomass and inundation patterns, allowing for the detection and delineation of these tall (up to 5 m), high density, high biomass invasive Phragmites stands. Classification was based on multi-season ALOS PALSAR L-band (23 cm wavelength) HR and HV polarization data. Seasonal (spring, summer, and fall) datasets were used to improve discrimination of Phragmites by taking advantage of phenological changes in vegetation and inundation patterns over the seasons. Extensive field collections of training and randomly selected validation data were conducted in 2010-2011 to aid in mapping and for accuracy assessments. Overall basin-wide map accuracy was 87%, with 86% producer's accuracy and 43% user's accuracy for invasive Phragmites. The invasive Phragmites maps are being used to identify major environmental drivers of this invader's distribution, to assess areas vulnerable to new invasion, and to provide information to regional stakeholders through a decision support tool.

Water-use dynamics of a peat swamp forest and a dune forest in Maputaland, South Africa	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Peat swamp forests are the second rarest forest type found in South Africa while dune forests have been under severe threat through mining and agriculture. Both forest types exist in the conservation area, and World Heritage site, known as the iSimangaliso Wetland Park on the East coast of South Africa. The area is prone to severe droughts (Taylor et al., 2006) and recent attempts to understand the local water balance revealed that there was insufficient information on the water use of the indigenous forests of the area. The peat swamp forest and dune forest sites studied in this research were located within close proximity to each other, yet, are characterised by different landscape positions in terms of water availability. The coastal dune forest soil profile was generally dry and sandy and the tree roots did not have access to the water table. In contrast the peat swamp forest is located in an interdunal wetland where the trees have permanent access to water. The climate at both sites is subtropical with a mean annual precipitation of 1200mmyr(-1). However, over 20 months of measurement, the first summer (October 2009 to March 2010) was drier (424 versus 735 mm) than the second summer (October 2010 to March 2011) emphasising the variability of the rainfall in the area and providing a wide range of conditions measured. The sap flow of an evergreen, overstory Syzygium cordatum and a semi-deciduous, understory Shirakiopsis elliptica were measured in the peat swamp forest using the heat ratio method. The Syzygium cordatum water use was not highly seasonal and the daily maximum water use ranged from approximately 30 Ld(-1) in winter to 45 Ld(-1) in summer whereas the Shirakiopsis elliptica water use was more seasonal at 2 Ld(-1) in winter and 12 Ld(-1) in summer. The water use of the Syzygium cordatum was not influenced by seasonal rainfall variations and was actually higher in the drier summer (October 2009 to March 2010). Three trees of different heights were monitored in the same way in the dune forest and the water use found to be highly seasonal. Over the entire measurement period, the water use was highest for an emergent Mimusops caffra (5 to 45 Ld(-1)), whereas the water use of the Eugenia natalitia (2 to 28 Ld(-1)) and Drypetes natalensis (1 to 4 Ld(-1)) was lower. At the dune forest, the water use was highest in the wetter summer due to the reliance of the trees on rainfall to recharge the soil water. A split-line regression showed that on average, soil water limited tree water use 64% of the time over the measurement period at the dune forest. For modelling tree water use at the dune forest, it was concluded that a two-stage model, taking soil water content into account (from multiple sampling points), would be necessary.

These included temperature; specific conductance; dissolved O2; alkalinity; pH; total and orthophosphate P; NO3, NO2 and NH3-N; chlorophyll a; transparency; major cations; and selected trace elements. The lake exhibited many characteristics of high productivity. Concentrations of chlorophyll a reached 60 .mu.g/l during summer months and were reflected in pH values in excess of 9. Anaerobic conditions developed during both summer and winter and, during these intervals, large pools of available nutrients developed in the lower waters. Mn and Fe concentrations varied greatly as a consequence of changes in the O2 regime.

Effects of changing light and temperature on one food-web component transfer to other components, producing a complex interplay between physical drivers and biotic feedbacks. Understanding this interplay is important, because altered climate regimes could result in phenological mismatch between the phytoplankton spring bloom and the timing of maximum food requirements of grazers. To separate direct effects of light and temperature on spring plankton dynamics from effects mediated through micro- and mesograzer feedbacks, we manipulated water temperature, stratification depth and presence/absence of the mesograzer Daphnia in lake mesocosms. In early spring, stratification depth and water temperature directly influenced the light supply to phytoplankton and the growth rates of all plankton groups. Subsequently, indirect effects, including light-dependent food supply to grazers and temperature-dependent grazing pressure, became increasingly important. Phytoplankton and Daphnia peaked earlier in warmer treatments and reached higher peaks when stratification depth was shallower. Ciliates responded positively to increased food density and higher temperature and subsequently affected the taxonomic composition, but not the total biomass, of phytoplankton. In the absence of Daphnia, phytoplankton did not enter a distinct clear water phase. When present, Daphnia caused an extended clear water phase, maintaining phytoplankton and ciliates at low levels throughout early summer and suppressing all direct effects of physical drivers on these plankton groups. Our Daphnia treatments mimicked the high and low fish predation settings of the largely descriptive, recently revised Plankton Ecology Group (PEG) model of seasonal plankton succession and explored their responses to climate change scenarios. The results largely support the PEG model, but attribute greater importance to early season temperature effects and later season grazing effects of Daphnia. In warmer treatments, the timing of phytoplankton and zooplankton peaks tended to be more closely coupled, and temperature did not affect the height of zooplankton peaks. In line with other experiments, these results do not support the widely held concern that warming may create a trophic mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton and reduce spring zooplankton production.

Relevant ecological parameters in the ponds were also recorded. The electrophoretic survey of the three ponds (Poza Sur, Poza Norte and Canal Central) revealed a high level of overall genetic polymorphism in four marker loci, but only 13 multilocus genotypes were found. We classified clones into three clonal groups (SS, SM, L) characterized by unique arrays of alleles in the four marker loci, and significant differences in body shape and size. Clonal group succession took place in Poza Sur; SM clones occurring in spring, SS clones from spring to fall, and L clones from fall to spring. Despite the partial overlapping of sexual periods, the absence of heterozygotes indicates that gene flow is strongly restricted between clonal groups. In the transition periods, the population was far from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to hetereozygote deficiencies in all four markers. In clonal group L, the only polymorphic locus, Pgi, was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In clonal group SM, both polymorphic loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in Poza Norte, but not in Poza Sur. Factor analysis on the limnological parameters recorded during held sampling indicates that genetically different clonal groups are also ecologically specialized. These findings suggest that the taxonomical species B. plicatilis is in fact a species complex. The complete genetic discontinuity model of rotifer population succession is supported by these data. Our results are similar to those found in cladocerans inhabiting temporary habitats.

In this paper, we analyse primary productivity changes in a seasonally ice-covered crater lake (Lake Tuofengling) in northeast China since the Last Glacial Maximum using biogenic silica content and the carbon preference index of short-chain n-alkanes as proxies. Results show that primary productivity was lower during the cold and dry glacial period, whereas it was higher during the warm and humid Holocene. During the last deglaciation, primary productivity experienced a similar to 1.5-kyr lagged response to BollingAllerod warming, and multiple oscillations during the Younger Dryas. Additionally, the peak productivity of the entire profile also occurred during this period. These fluctuations and the highest primary productivity are suggested to be the result of the combined influences of increased summer temperatures and regional permafrost melting. The current state of primary productivity in Lake Tuofengling is moderate but has been increasing since the abrupt increase in diatom productivity after similar to 3 ka B.P. This stage is associated with increased dust deposition and longer ice-free periods under winter-warming conditions. We suggest that longer seasonal stratification under the current warmer winters and increased nutrient concentrations caused by decreased lake level will increase the risk of lake ecosystem degradation in the future.					sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022														0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 1	2024	655								112543	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112543		OCT 2024											WOS:001338261100001

The temporal-spatial variations and sources of OCPs were also analyzed. Twenty types of OCPs were detected in the gas phase with a total concentration of 484.8 +/- 550.4pg/m(3). Endosulfan, DDTs and chlordane were the primary OCPs in the gas phase. The mean concentration of OCPs in the gas phase was significantly higher in the summer than in the winter. Seventeen types of OCPs were detected in the particle phase with a total concentration of 18.3 +/- 26.1 pg/m(3). DDTs were major OCPs in the particle phase. The mean concentration of OCPs in the particle phase decreased at first and then increased during the period. The potential source of the HCHs in ambient air of Lake Chaohu might come from recent lindane usage. DDTs mainly came from historical dicofol usage, and an input of DDT was observed in the spring, which may result from the present use of marine paint that contains technical DDT. Endosulfan and chlordane in the air may be due to the present use of technical endosulfan and chlordane.

J	JELLISON, R; MELACK, JM				JELLISON, R; MELACK, JM			ALGAL PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY AND ITS RESPONSE TO MEROMIXIS IN HYPERSALINE MONO-LAKE, CALIFORNIA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Photosynthetic activity was measured in hypersaline Mono Lake during an 8-yr period (1983-1990) spanning the onset (1983), persistence (1984-1987), and breakdown of meromixis (1988). Algal biomass in spring and autumn decreased following the onset of meromixis and annual photosynthetic production was reduced (269-462 g C m-2 yr-1; 1984-1986) compared to nonmeromictic conditions (499-641 g C m-2 yr-1; 1989 and 1990). A gradual increase in photosynthetic production occurred even before meromixis ended because of increased vertical flux of ammonium due to deeper mixing and the buildup of ammonium in the monimolimnion. Annual production was greatest in 1988 (1,064 g C m-2 yr-1) when the weakening of chemical stratification and eventual breakdown of meromixis in November resulted in large fluxes of ammonium into the euphotic zone. Most of the variation in rates of light-saturated carbon uptake normalized to chlorophyll a (assimilation numbers) was explained by a regression on temperature (60%); measures of the light and nutrient environments accounted for a further 8% of the observed variation. Estimates of ammonium supply due to vertical mixing and Artemia monica excretion indicate nitrogen is most likely to limit photosynthetic production during spring and late autumn when A. monica is absent and algal biomass high. Light is also likely to limit production during these periods based on comparisons of the average mixed-layer irradiance to the light intensity at which maximum photosynthetic rates were reached. Light limitation was more pronounced under monomictic conditions when algal biomass was higher.

High resolution Lateglacial and early-Holocene summer air temperature records from Scotland inferred from chironomid assemblages	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lateglacial and early-Holocene mean July air temperatures have been reconstructed, using a chironomid-based inference model, from lake-sediment sequences from Abernethy Forest, in the eastern Highlands of Scotland, and Loch Ashik, on the Isle of Skye in north-west Scotland. Chronology for Abernethy Forest was derived from radiocarbon dates of terrestrial plant macrofossils deposited in the lake sediments. Chronology for Loch Ashik was derived from tephra layers of known ages, the first age-depth model of this kind. Chironomid-inferred temperatures peak early in the Lateglacial Interstadial and then gradually decline by about 1 degrees C to the beginning of the Younger Dryas (YD). At Abernethy Forest, the Lateglacial Interstadial is punctuated by three centennial-scale cold oscillations which appear to be synchronous with the Greenland Interstadial events GI-1d, when temperatures at Abernethy fell by 5.9 degrees C, GI-1c, when temperatures fell by 2.3 degrees C, and GI-1b, when temperatures fell by 2.8 degrees C. At Loch Ashik only the oscillation correlated with GI-1d is clearly defined, when temperatures fell by 3.8 degrees C. The start of the YD is clearly marked at both sites when temperatures fell by 5.5 degrees C at Abernethy Forest and 2.8 degrees C at Loch Ashik. A warming trend is apparent during the late-YD at Abernethy Forest but at Loch Ashik late-YD temperatures became very cold, possibly influenced by its close proximity to the Skye ice-field. The rapidly rising temperatures at the YD - Holocene transition occur about 300 years earlier at both sites than changes in sediment lithology and loss-on-ignition. The temperature trends at both sites are broadly similar, although between-site differences may result from the influence of local factors. Similar climate trends are found at other sites in the northern British Isles. However, the British summer temperature records differ in detail from trends in the oxygen-isotope records from the Greenland ice-cores and from other chironomid-inferred temperature records available from Scandinavia, north-west Europe and central Europe, which suggest important differences in the influence of climatic forcing at regional scales.

Factors Affecting Wetland Use by Spring Migrating Ducks in the Southern Prairie Pothole Region	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												There is increasing recognition of the importance of wetlands in the prairie pothole region (PPR) of the northern United States for stopover habitat for spring-migrating waterfowl. The quality and quantity of stopover habitat found near breeding areas can affect speed and success of migration and subsequent breeding events. Conservation and management of wetlands in the region has traditionally focused narrowly on reproductive phases of the life cycle, and little to no research has examined how ducks use a diversity of available wetlands in the region during migration. We conducted weekly surveys on 1,061 wetlands during spring 2018 and 2019 to examine factors affecting duck use of wetlands in the intensively modified southern PPR landscape of Iowa, USA, for wetland restoration and conservation strategies. We compared wetland types, which included farmed, seasonal, and semi-permanent wetlands, and lakes. The highest duck use per unit area occurred on semi-permanent wetlands, followed by seasonal, and then farmed wetlands, and lakes. Ducks were highly clustered in our study, with 75% of all use-days occurring on only 37 wetlands comprising 41% of all wetland area surveyed. We used hurdle models to examine how local and landscape factors measured within and around wetlands influenced duck use during spring migration. Multiple factors related to duck use at local and landscape scales, such as wetland area, vegetation abundance, and number of wetlands in the surrounding landscape. Among semi-permanent wetlands, local factors within wetlands were more important than landscape factors in determining duck use. Collectively, our findings suggest semi-permanent wetlands within the PPR play a key role in transitioning birds from wintering areas to breeding areas and that management of semi-permanent wetlands should promote interspersion of emergent vegetation and open water and growth of submersed aquatic plants to improve their function for migrants.

J	Kim, T; Ki, JS				Kim, Taehee; Ki, Jang-Seu			Autumn blooms and seasonality of the dinoflagellate Unruhdinium penardii in the Han River (Korea) as tracked by morphological and molecular techniques	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Dinoflagellate blooms mainly occur in marine environments, and also occur in freshwater. This study reported the autumn blooms of the freshwater dinoflagellate Unruhdinium penardii var. robustum from the Paldang Reservoir in the Han River, South Korea. Morphological and molecular methods were used to examine 2 years of water samples collected monthly in 2012 and 2019. Environmental factors such as temperature, dissolved oxygen and nutrients showed similar seasonal patterns in 2-year comparisons. The chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton cell concentrations were higher in 2019 than in 2012. Dinoflagellate cells were abundantly detected in autumn, with a maximum of 5.1 x 10(6) cells center dot L-1 in 2012 and 3.1 x 10(6) cells center dot L-1 in 2019. Of these, the dinoflagellate U. penardii var. robustum was predominant in October 2019. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 28S rDNA of Unruhdinium detected the highest copy numbers (5.1 x 10(8) copies center dot L-1 in November 2012 and 8.6 x 10(8) copies center dot L-1 in October 2019) in autumn. These patterns matched well with the microscopic cell counts. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that autumn samples were correlated with 28S rDNA of Unruhdinium. These results suggest autumn blooms and seasonality of the dinoflagellate U. penardii var. robustum in the Paldang Reservoir.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR 24	2022	44	2					194	207	fbac009	10.1093/plankt/fbac009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbac009		FEB 2022											WOS:000757835700001

Zizania latifolia Turcz. cultivated in China	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												Zizania latifolia, which belongs to the tribe Oryzeae, has been cultivated for more than 2000 years and has historically been used in China mainly as an aquatic vegetable. In China, the largest area under cultivation of this plant is located in the regions surrounding Tai Lake, in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Two main types of cultivars have been developed, in one the shoots can be harvested only once, in the fall; in the other, the shoots may be harvested twice in the fall and once the following summer. Z. latifolia can be bred and conserved through clonal propagation as a means of preventing infection of flowering stems by the epiphyte Ustilago esculenta. At the end of the harvest period, healthy individuals and the plants with black spots in the shoots are removed, and those with a healthy clone will be identified and selected as 'seed' for the next year.

To evaluate the potential effects of global warming on shallow eutrophic lakes, a flow-through experiment combining three temperature scenarios and two nutrient levels was conducted in 24 outdoor mesocosms. Eight mesocosms were unheated and acted as controls, while sixteen were heated - eight according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) climate scenario A2 down-scaled to regional level (2.5-4.4 degrees C, depending on season) and eight according to scenario A2+ with an additional 50% temperature increase. Half of the mesocosms were enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus to simulate increased runoff from terrestrial sources due to the increased precipitation predicted by the A2 scenario. The other half were un-enriched and received only natural nutrient input from the groundwater that fed all the mesocosms. The abundance and development pattern of the microbial communities within the mesocosms were tracked during a 16-month period. Generally, the results showed that the abundances of picoalgae, bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates changed in a similar manner over time; abundances being lower in winter than in summer. Warming in itself had no effect on abundance, albeit it significantly modified the positive effect of the nutrients. Only at ambient temperatures did the whole microbial assemblage respond positively to nutrients. In the A2 scenario, only picoalgae responded to nutrients, while in the A2+ scenario all but the heterotrophic nanoflagellates showed a response. Elevated winter temperatures seemed not to be more important for the microbial assemblage than elevated summer temperatures. Our results demonstrate that the direct effects of warming were far less important than the nutrient effect. The results furthermore reveal that warming and nutrients in combination set off complex interactions. In consequence, global warming may possibly have pronounced effects on aquatic ecosystems if accompanied by increased nutrient loading.

J	La Licata, M				La Licata, Manuel			Climate change remarks in a glacial catchment within Southern Rhaetian Alps: the Fumo Valley case study (Adamello Group, Northern Italy)	RENDICONTI ONLINE DELLA SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA												In this study, glacier retreat from the end of the Little Ice Age to present time and climatic variations on recent time scale were assessed in the Fumo Valley, which is a small glacial catchment located in the Adamello Group (Southern Rhaetian Alps, Italy). The study area has a high scientific and cultural value as part of the UNESCO Adamello-Brenta Geopark and provides several ecosystem and socioeconomic services. Therefore, the assessment of climate change impacts at local scale is essential for a sustainable watershed management, as well as for conservation strategies. A present-state glacier inventory was elaborated by means of remote sensing using Sentinel-2 satellite images. Then, it was compared to previous published glacier inventories in order to assess numerical and geometric surface variations. Also, two temperature data series related to different thirty-year periods (i.e., 1971-2000 and 1991-2020) were analysed to assess air temperature variations. The results highlight a total surface loss of 5.99 km2 (-70.9%) between 1850 and 1958. Between 1958 and 2022 a total area reduction of 0.87 km2 (-35.5%) was observed, which is comparable to other studies carried out at national scale. However, a minor progression phase was observed between 1958 and 1981 (+76.3%), which is partially attributable to the glacial advance episode that occurred between the 1970s and 1980s in the Italian Alps. After, total glacier area declined by 63.4% (1981-2022), with an accelerated regression between 2015 and 2022 (i.e., higher annual rate of variation, formation of ice-contact lakes, tongue separation, and severe glacier fragmentation). The mean annual air temperature rose of 0.6 & DEG;C, with a greater variation in mean annual maximum temperature (+1 & DEG;C) than minimum temperature (+0.1 & DEG;C), and an average temperature increase higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. These results can be interpreted as truthful indicators of climate change impacts occurring at local scale, highlighting the vulnerability of the study area with respect to the predicted future climatic scenarios.					; La Licata, Manuel/JXX-7537-2024	La Licata, Manuel/0000-0001-9106-6408; 													2035-8008					JUL	2023	60				SI		51	71		10.3301/ROL.2023.32	http://dx.doi.org/10.3301/ROL.2023.32													WOS:001033590600001

Bagavath			A numerical study of sea breeze circulation observed at a tropical site Kalpakkam on the east coast of India, under different synoptic flow situations	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												A simulation study of the sea breeze circulation and thermal internal boundary layer (TIBL) characteristics, has been carried out at the tropical site Kalpakkam on the east coast of India, for operational atmospheric dispersion prediction. The community based PSU/NCAR MM5 Mesoscale meteorological model is used for the study. Three cases on typical days in summer (24 May 2003), southwest (SW) monsoon (1 July 2001) winter season (2 February 2003) with different large-scale flow pattern are studied. The MM5 model is used with 3 nested domains with horizontal grid resolutions 18km., 6km and 2km and 26 vertical levels. The model is integrated for 24 hours in the above cases with initial and boundary conditions taken from NCEP-FNL analyses data. Observations of 10 meteorological stations and coastal boundary layer experiments conducted at Kalpakkam are used for comparison and validation of the simulation. The characteristics of simulated sea breeze and TIBL at Kalpakkam. are seen to vary in the above cases according to the prevailing large-scale winds and surface fluxes. The sea breeze circulation is seen to develop early with larger strength and inland propagation in the summer case under the influence of moderate synoptic wind and strong heating conditions than in the SW monsoon and winter cases. The horizontal and vertical extents of TIBL are found to be larger in the summer case than in other cases. Although model parameters agree in general with observations, all the fine features are not clearly captured and some slowness in model sea breeze development is also seen. The results indicate the need to improve i) the initial conditions by assimilation of available surface/upper air observations to reduce model, bias and ii) surface net radiation parameterisation. The model could predict the essential features of the local circulation and further improvement is expected with better initial condition data and incorporation of more realistic surface data.

The relationship between somatic changes and gonad cycle was also investigated and discussed. Measurements of condition factor (K), nutrition (NS), gonadosomatic index (GSI) and somatic and gonad energy content (J g(-1) dw) were made in individual specimens taken from the river monthly for 12 months. Gonad development took place from the end of the winter, and spawning took place in spring, with fish quiescent in summer. The energy required for ovarian development was greater than the one for testes development. During the period of gonad growth, a decline in the nutrition stage of the adult fish as well as in the average somatic energy content of both in males and females was observed. Somatic energy content was linearly related to the condition (K) and nutrition (NS) indices. In mature fish, gonad energy content was correlated to the gonadosomatic index (GSI). A positive significant correlation among somatic energy content, gonad development (both GSI and gonad energy content) and condition was found. In nase from Guadalete river, the gonad development cycle, as well as the energy required for spawning, affected the condition and somatic energy storage.					; Encina Encina, Lourdes/JXM-2169-2024	Encina Encina, Maria Lourdes/0000-0002-8218-3327; Granado Lorencio, Carlos Antonio/0000-0002-3322-4276													0139-7893						1997	46			1			123	132																WOS:000073184700015

During the spring and summer flooding season it inundates a large area while in the winter it shrinks considerably, creating a large tract of marshland for wild migratory birds. A better knowledge of the water coverage duration and the beginning and ending dates for the vast range of marshlands surrounding the lake is important for the measurement, modelling and management of marshland ecosystems. In addition, the abundance of a special type of snail (Oncomelania hupensis), the intermediate host of parasite schistosome (Schistosoma japonicum) in this region, is also heavily dependent on the water coverage information. However, there is no accurate digital elevation model (DEM) for the lake bottom and the inundated marshland, nor is there sufficient water level information over this area. In this study, we assess the feasibility of the use of multitemporal Landsat images for mapping the spatial-temporal change of Poyang Lake water body and the temporal process of water inundation of marshlands. Eight cloud-free Landsat Thematic Mapper images taken during a period of one year were used in this study. We used the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) methods to map water bodies. We then examined the annual spatial-temporal change of the Poyang Lake water body. Finally we attempted to obtain the duration of water inundation of marshlands based on the temporal sequence of water extent determined from the Landsat images. The results showed that although the images can be used to capture the snapshots of water coverage in this area, they are insufficient to provide accurate estimation of the spatial-temporal process of water inundation over the marshlands through linear interpolation.					; Huang, huabing/JHT-7278-2023; Yu, Qian/A-6787-2010; Xu, Bing/C-7732-2015; Gong, Peng/AAM-1516-2021	Xu, Bing/0000-0001-9159-2512; huang, hua bing/0000-0001-6253-8437; Yu, Qian/0000-0001-6816-3082													0143-1161	1366-5901					2008	29	20					5767	5784		10.1080/01431160802060912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160802060912													WOS:000259366300001

We investigated a set of peat pools - remnants of former peat extraction - and examined the impact of the common thecamoeba Amelia vulgaris on the major components of the microbial loop (algae, bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates). The experiment consisted of two treatments under laboratory conditions, i.e. control versus the removal of Arcella vulgaris. The results suggest a substantial impact of Arcella vulgaris on the microbial communities, which is reflected in a decrease in abundance, biomass and a transformation of the size structure of bacteria towards smaller forms. Moreover, flagellate number and composition of algae were affected by this species. In both spring and summer, numbers of heterotrophic flagellates were significantly higher in the control than in the removal treatment. In spring, diatoms were dominant in the control, but their biomass decreased towards the end of the experiment, whereas in the removal treatment, a slight biomass increase of diatoms was observed. In summer, the biomass of cyanobacteria increased while that of desmids decreased in the control.

J	Wang, J; Chen, L; Li, SL				Wang, Jing; Chen, Lei; Li, Shuanglin			The Influence of North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice in the Barents Sea on Spring Mongolian Cyclone Activity	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The Mongolian cyclone, a type of extratropical cyclone, significantly impacts regional weather. This study objectively identifies and tracks the Mongolian cyclone during spring (March-May) from 1950 to 2022, analyzing the relationships between its interannual variability, atmospheric circulations, sea surface temperature (SST), and Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC). The results show that the negative height anomaly over Lake Baikal is a key circulation system for the abnormal increase in spring Mongolian cyclones. The anomalous decrease in North Atlantic SST during spring leads to a negative east Atlantic/western Russia (EA/WR) pattern, resulting in a negative height anomaly over Lake Baikal. Additionally, the reduction in Barents Sea SIC weakens the polar vortex circulation, contributing to the negative anomaly over Lake Baikal and promoting Mongolian cyclone development. Numerical simulations confirm these observations, indicating that both the negative anomalies in North Atlantic SST and Barents Sea SIC independently affect the interannual variation in spring Mongolian cyclone frequency. Furthermore, the combined effect of SST and SIC anomalies has a more pronounced influence on spring Mongolian cyclone activity compared to their individual effects. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The objective of this study is to enhance our understanding of the relationship between interannual variations in spring Mongolian cyclone frequency, sea surface temperature, and Arctic Sea ice concentration. The Mongolian cyclone can result in severe weather phenomena, such as strong winds and sandstorms, which significantly impact both human lives and property. Given the context of global warming, predicting Mongolian cyclone has become increasingly uncertain. Our research findings suggest that the anomalous decrease in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures and the reduction of sea ice concentration in the Barents Sea significantly influence the frequency of spring Mongolian cyclone.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				FEB	2025	38	4					877	889		10.1175/JCLI-D-24-0407.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-24-0407.1													WOS:001435976500001

Studies on the biology of particular species and their fecundity have been conducted much less often, and there is very little such information from the Balkan Peninsula. The present study attempts to fill in some of the gaps in the existing knowledge upon reproduction of water mites. Female individuals were collected from Lake Skadar and its catchment in Montenegro, in May and October 2014. Then they were placed in 40 ml beakers until eggs were laid and observed until the larvae were hatched. The eggs were laid by females representing 15 species. The numbers of egg-laying females of a given species ranged from 1 to 124. The average number of eggs laid by a female ranged from 1 to 60. The number of eggs laid in May was much higher than in October. Females which lays the most eggs (representing 9 species) were collected in springs, followed by Lake Skadar (7 species) and in rivers (4 species). Only one species, Hygrobates setosus, was encountered in all types of waters studied, two species were encountered in the lake and in springs (Lebertia ineaqualis and Piona disparilis), and one (Hygrobates fluviatilis) in springs and in rivers. In general, the highest numbers of eggs were laid by females from rivers, followed by those from springs and from the lake. The average time of embryonic development ranged from 9 days (Hydrochoreutes krameri) to 20 days (Atractides fonticulus and Protzia eximia), while the total incubation period ranged from 9 to 30 days. It seems that the water mites laid higher number of eggs in the spring than in the autumn. Hatching time depends on the temperature. The number of eggs laid by one female is characteristic of the species or genus.

The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the water of Lake Hulun has a high concentration. However, little is known about the occurrence characteristics and source of the DOM in Lake Hulun. The spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of DOM concentration in Lake Hulun were thoroughly surveyed, and the optical characteristics, fluorescence components and sources of DOM were analyzed by excitation emission matrix (EMM) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) technology. The DOM concentration was 6.46-42.87 mg C/L, and was highest in summer and lowest in winter. The difference in the spatial distribution of DOM in winter was significant due to the ice over, and showed a trend where the concentration near the shore was higher than that in the center of the lake. Three humic-like components and one component consisting of a mixture of humic-like and protein-like substances of DOM were identified, with the former being prevalent. The humification index of DOM was 2.22-9.92, indicating that the DOM has a high degree of humification. The DOM is mainly derived from terrestrial sources, with the highest proportion (91.0% +/- 8.1%) found in winter and the lowest (66.2% +/- 7.7%) in summer. Given that the DOM in Lake Hulun is mainly dominated by humic-like components with a high degree humification, the DOM may have low bioactivity. However, this is just a preliminary analysis and judgment, and it is necessary to conduct other experiments such as biodegradation experiments to further study the bioavailability of DOM in Lake Hulun.					; chen, junyi/HGC-7380-2022; Wang, Shuhang/AAJ-7930-2020; Wang, Wenwen/AED-9614-2022	Zheng, Binghui/0000-0003-3169-1521; 														2073-4441				APR	2020	12	4							953	10.3390/w12040953	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12040953													WOS:000539527500030

A 100,000-year record of annual and seasonal rainfall and temperature for northwestern Australia based on a pollen record obtained offshore	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Pollen recovered from core tops of deep-sea cores from offshore northwestern Western Australia were used to build climatic transfer functions applied to sediment samples from major rivers bordering the ocean in the same region and a deep-sea core offshore Northwest Cape. Results show for the last 100 000 years, with a gap in the record spanning the 64 000 to 46 000 years interval, that from about 100000 to 82 000 yr BP, climatic conditions represented by rainfall, temperature and number of humid months, were significantly higher than today's values. For the entire record, the coldest period occurred about 43 000 to 39 000 yr BP but it was wetter than today, whereas the Last Glacial Maximum saw a significant reduction in summer rainfall, interpreted as a result of the absence of monsoonal activity in the region. The Holocene can be divided into two distinct phases: one peaking around 6000 cal. yr BP with highest rainfall and summer temperatures; the second one commencing at 5000 cal. yr BP and showing a progressive decrease in summer rainfall in contrast to an increase in winter rainfall, paralleled by a progressive decrease in temperatures.

The phytoplankton from Fuxian Lake included 78 species belonging to 40 genera 25 family, 7 phyla. Chlorophytes was predominant, with consisted of 43.5% of total species number. Species number of phytoplankton and cell density, and chlorophyll a appeared visible monthly variation. Phytoplankton cell density was highest at water layer of 0-20m. The average cell density of phytoplankton was on 18th September (342.73x10(3)cells/dm(3) ) > on 13th September (235.67x 10(3) cells/dm(3)) > on 14th August (80.10x10(3) cells/dm(3))> on 26th May (52.46x10(3) cells/dm(3)). The main predominant phytoplankton species was Mougeotia bloodlei, which accounted for 42.94%-84.94%. of total cell density of phytoplankton. Therefore the monthly variation of the cell density of Mougeotia bloodlei controlled the overall density of phytoplankton directly. The change of dominant species from 1990 to present study was Mougeotia bloodlei (Chlorophyta) from Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (Cyanophyta). The community structures of phytoplankton were consists of Mougeotia bloodlei, Chroococcus spp., Cyclotella spp., Ceratium hirundinella and Dinobryon sertularia. The cell density of phytoplankton was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration, and negatively correlated with the concentration of nutrient salts (PO43-, NO3- and SiO32-).																					978-7-03-020403-5				2007							65	73																WOS:000252307300011

Surface water samples from six lakes and the Vistula and Oder Rivers were collected in spring and autumn 2012 and 2013. The mean Sr-90 and Cs-137 concentrations were 3.92 +/- 0.40 and 4.49 +/- 2.00 mBq L-1, respectively. Correlations were identified between the radionuclide concentrations and meteorological conditions and the original fallout distribution from the Chernobyl disaster. The annual average radionuclide concentrations were not significantly different from the concentrations found between 1994 and 2011.

J	Liddicoat, JC; Coe, RS; Glen, JM				Liddicoat, JC; Coe, RS; Glen, JM			Record of the younger part of the Pringle Falls excursion at Long Valley, California	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												The younger of two closely spaced palaeomagnetic excursions at Pringle Falls, Oregon, is recorded in lacustrine silts that crop out in Long Valley, California. Assigned an age of about 220 000 years, the virtual geomagnetic poles of the younger excursion form a clockwise loop that reached 35 degrees S latitude east of South America before returning to the northern hemisphere in the Pacific Ocean west of Central America. The poles then form a narrow band across North America while moving to high northern latitudes. This record matches extremely well feature B of the original excursion record from Pringle Falls reported by Herrero-Bervera et al. (1994) and is similar to this excursion at Summer Lake, Oregon (Negrini et al. 1994), in that the pole path is confined primarily to the east-central Pacific Ocean. On the basis of an assumed sedimentation rate of 30 cm per thousand years, the younger excursion (feature B at Pringle Falls) spans an estimated 1200 years and followed by about 1000 years a larger excursion (feature A at Pringle Falls) previously discovered at the same Long Valley site. At a second Long Valley site 30 m away, the younger excursion (feature B) is only partially recorded because of a presumed small hiatus in the sedimentary section.																			0956-540X					NOV	1998	135	2					663	670		10.1046/j.1365-246X.1998.00680.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-246X.1998.00680.x													WOS:000076899400026
J	Yan, D; Wünnemann, B				Yan, Dada; Wuennemann, Bernd			Late Quaternary water depth changes in Ha la Lake, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, derived from ostracod assemblages and sediment properties in multiple sediment records	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Late Pleistocene and Holocene climate dynamics along the marginal belt of the East Asian Summer Monsoon in China and their responses to hydrological cycles in lake basins of the Tibetan Plateau are still a matter of scientific discussion. Hala Lake, a closed 65 m deep lake basin in the western Qilian Mountains, Qinghai Province, is considered a monitor of climate-driven hydrological and environmental changes during the past 24 kyr BP. The distribution patterns of ostracod assemblages, stable isotopes, sediment-geochemical properties in four sediment records from different water depths and their combination with the unique limnological setting enabled us to reconstruct four major phases of centennial-scale water depth fluctuations from the global Last Glacial Maximum (ca 24 kyr BP) to the Present. Our results show that Hala Lake experienced a very shallow and small water body during the LGM and Lateglacial under cold and dry climate conditions. Rapid increase of water depth and contemporaneous lake expansion started at around 14 kyr BP (Phase I), most likely as a result of glacier melt due to the onset of climate warming. The lake reached >45 m water depth at around 13.5 kyr BR Reduced water depth during the Younger Dryas spell (ca 12 kyr BP) may be attributed to a short-term return to cooler and drier conditions. During the early Holocene (Phase II), water depth increased further toward lake highstands close to its present level, with a highest lake level of up to 9 m above the present lakestand at 8.0-7.8 kyr BR Besides continued glacier melt supply, we assume that summer monsoon effective moisture contributed to the overall water budget, but remained relatively unstable, favoring water depth fluctuations. A pronounced lower water depth falls into the period between 9.2 and 8.1 kyr BP, perhaps the result of weak monsoon influence or its complete absence, although the warming trend continued toward its optimum at ca 8-7 kyr BR A distinct mass flow, most likely triggered by an earthquake, occurred during a lake lowstand either at ca 7.0 kyr BP or at around 8.1 kyr BP. The mid-Holocene (Phase III) was characterized by fluctuating water depths between 7.8 and 4.5 kyr BR Conflicting trends of stable isotope data limit the validity of water depth estimations, but may show higher lake levels between 5.5 and 4.5 kyr BP, coincident with dated lake sediments in a cliff position at the northern lake shore. This positive water balance can most likely be attributed to increased westerly-derived moisture supply during autumn and late winter, although summer monsoon influence could also be of significance. Coincident with the 4.2 ka event, the lake experienced shallow water at around 4.1 kyr BP, perhaps as a result of continued cooling and drier climate conditions, supporting the arguments of a general cooling trend throughout the Holocene. The Late Holocene (Phase IV) is characterized by extremely unstable hydrological conditions with rapid fluctuations in water depth, more frequently controlled by westerly-driven effective moisture supply. Since the lake lowstand at about 1.4-1.2 kyr BP, the lake has developed toward its present level. Our research underlines the necessity for comparing multiple proxy records from different lake sites to better evaluate centennial-scale climate-driven variations throughout the late Pleistocene and Holocene periods. All presented data suggest the variable influence of summer monsoon effective moisture on the hydrological budget of the lake. Water depth variations did not follow the long-term pattern of the Asian monsoon system due to a potential modulation by westerly-derived moisture impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this area, 75 springs were investigated in the summer period of 2014 and 2015 to determine bacterial number, biomass and hydrolytic activity. All investigated objects were categorized by direct catchment land use and hydrobiological type. The number and biomass of bacteria in the water of the investigated springs is much smaller than in other types of surface water in lowland areas and ranges from 0.29 to 2.94 10(6) cells cm(-3). The best reflection of the habitat quality within lowland groundwater outflows is their hydrobiological typology (helocrene, rheocrene and limnocrene). Despite differing development of spring niches, their hydrology, as well as the geological material and its graining cause unification of the bacterial numbers. The number of bacteria cells were correlated with the concentration of some nitrogen compounds (NH4+, NO2-), and the hydrolytic activity of bacteria with phosphorus compounds mainly dissolved phosphorus. The presence of dissolved organic carbon compounds turned out to be the most disturbing factor in the development of bacterioplankton. Concentrations of these parameters were found to be conditioned by the management of the direct outflow catchment. Furthermore in rheocrene springs, bacterial activity during hydrological stress is clearly lower, despite a large number of bacterial cells in the water (r=-0.38; p<0.005). Our results show that lowland springs are a very sensitive objects to changes in land use, which has a significant impact on water quality and thus the number and activity of bacteria.

The substrate samples included sediment, bark shavings from submerged wood, and aquatic macrophyte leaves. These samples, taken from September through November, were fixed in a 0.5% osmium tetroxide solution and observed with a scanning electron microscope. The water samples, collected from January to November, were preserved with Lugol's iodine and observed under light microscopy. Our purpose was to examine the life cycles of the dinoflagellate species Peridinium inconspicuum, Peridinium wisconsinense, and Peridinium gatunense. The water samples showed that dinoflagellate populations peaked in late summer and then quickly disappeared from the water column. The substrate data showed that the different Peridinium species showed a preference for specific substrates prior to zygote formation. This suggests a selective function for the planozygote stage during the life cycle.

Comparison of our records to published ice core and terrestrial proxy-climate data sets suggests that atmospheric temperature changes over Northern Europe and Greenland were coupled to SST variability and ice rafting. The records outline four major climatic phases: (i) an early-Holocene Thermal Maximum that lasted until approximately 6.7 kyr BP, (ii) a distinctly cooler phase associated with increased ice rafting between 6.5 and 3.7 kyr BP, (iii) a transition to generally warmer, but relatively unstable climate conditions between 3.7 and 2 kyr BP and (iv) a second distinct SST decline that took place between 2 and 0.5 kyr BP. In contrast to the dominant control of Northern Hemisphere summer insolation on early-Holocene climate development (via strong seasonality), the trigger for the onset of relatively unstable climatic conditions in the North Atlantic at 3.7 kyr BP is not straightforward. However, it is possible that this change was triggered by late-Holocene winter insolation increase at high northern latitude and/or by inter-hemispheric changes in orbital forcing. The late-Holocene Neoglaciation trend, which is characteristic of numerous terrestrial archives in northern Europe, may not only be attributed to a gradual decrease in orbitally forced summer temperature, but also to increase snow precipitation at high northern latitudes during generally milder winters.

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) are the key contributors to ammonia oxidation, and their relative contribution to this process is one of the most important issues related to the nitrogen cycle in the ocean. In this study, the differential contributions of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation in surface sediments from adjacent waters of Rushan Bay were studied based on the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene. Molecular biology techniques were used to analyze ammonia oxidizers' community characteristics, and potential nitrification incubation was applied to understand the ammonia oxidizers' community activity. The objective was to determine the community structure and activity of AOA and AOB in surface sediments from adjacent waters of Rushan Bay and to discuss the different contributions of AOA and AOB to ammonia oxidation during summer and winter seasons in the studied area. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the diversity of AOA was higher than that of AOB. The majority of AOA and AOB clustered into Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosospira, respectively, indicating that the Nitrosopumilus group and Nitrosospira groups may be more adaptable in studied sediments. The AOA community was closely correlated to temperature, salinity and ammonium concentration, whereas the AOB community showed a stronger correlation with temperature, chlorophyll-a content (chla) and nitrite concentration. qPCR results showed that both the abundance and the transcript abundance of AOA was consistently greater than that of AOB. AOA and AOB differentially contributed to ammonia oxidation in different seasons. AOB occupied the dominant position in mediating ammonia oxidation during summer, while AOA might play a dominant role in ammonia oxidation during winter.

To analyse the nature of internal loading we studied 1. the seasonal phosphorus concentrations of 265 Danish shallow, mainly eutrophic lakes; 2. seasonal phosphorus mass balances and retention for eight years in 16 eutrophic lakes, and 3. phosphorus mass balances and changing sediment phosphorus profiles for 15 years in one hypertrophic lake. Lake water, inlets and outlets were routinely sampled 10-26 times annually. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations during summer were two-four times higher than winter values in lakes with a mean summer total phosphorus concentration (TPsum ) above 0.2 mg P l(-1). Annual phosphorus retention decreased with increasing TPsum and was lower than predicted from the Vollenweider model, particularly in lakes with TPsum above 0.2 mg P l(-1). The seasonal phosphorus retention in lakes with TPsum below 0.1 mg P l(-1) was positive during the whole season, except July and August when mean retention ranged from -10 to -30% of inlet loading. In lakes with TPsum above 0.1 mg P l(-1), the retention was positive during winter, but negative from April to September. The negative retention was most pronounced in lakes with the highest TPsum, particularly in May and July when mean retention ranged from -50 to -68% in lakes with TPsum above 0.2 mg P l(-1). The retention was generally less negative in June, when a clearwater phase typically occurs and close to 0 also in lakes with a high TPsum. Mass balances from the hypertrophic lake have now shown a 15-yr net annual negative retention following reduced external loading. Sediment profiles suggest phosphorus release from depths down to 25 cm and that net internal phosphorus loading may persist for another 15 yrs. It is concluded that internal loading of shallow eutrophic lakes may have a considerable and persistent impact on summer TP after reduced external loading.

An instrumented buoy provided high-frequency free-water dissolved oxygen measurements, water temperature profiles, and meteorological data, which we used to estimate daily values of gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP). Results revealed that the disappearance of monsoons decreased lake level and volume, concentrated dissolved nutrients, stimulated the development of algal biomass, promoted stratification, and resulted in a major shift in lake metabolism. Offshore GPP and R were both initially stimulated but then decreased due to shallower mixing depths in the water column. The lake rapidly shifted from a heterotrophic state to a highly autotrophic status when the water level dropped to the lowest level. A return to autotrophy was caused by a greater decline in R than an increase in GPP. This study demonstrates the dramatic effect that drought events can have on lake ecosystem function and suggests that nutrient control may be important in mitigating the effects of a predicted warmer and drier climate and increased water withdrawal in this region.

They provide valuable ecosystem services but suffer from oxygen depletion. To understand the nutrient distribution in a saline lake that experiences complete circulation and temporarily forms an anoxic-water mass but has limited freshwater inflow, we monitored the vertical profiles of inorganic nutrients and physicochemical parameters in Lake Hiruga during various intervals from January 2019 to July 2021. We found that dissolved oxygen (DO) was depleted below 20-m depth from April to December in both 2019 and 2020. However, DO was supplied to the lake bottom during the winter period (January-March), except for 2021, when oxygen-depleted water remained below the 35-m depth. The concentrations of ammonium, phosphate, and silicates remained high in the oxygen-depleted water above the lakebed and increased throughout the water column during the winter blast period. Nitrates and nitrites were distributed within the borderline region between the anoxic and oxic waters during the stratification period from spring to early winter. The oxygen-depleted water mass formed high nitrate and low nitrite concentrations during the winter of 2020, indicating that DO was supplied to the lake bottom but was consumed immediately. This suggested that inorganic nutrients in Lake Hiruga originated mainly from lakebed sediments and were eluted into the anoxic-water mass and then distributed throughout the water column via winter mixing. Furthermore, DO supplied through lake circulation processes played a role in changing the chemical forms of nutrients.

Seasonal Variations of Dissolved Organic Matter by Fluorescent Analysis in a Typical River Catchment in Northern China	WATER												Fluorescence (excitation-emission matrices, EEMs) spectroscopy coupled with PARAFAC (parallel factor) modelling and UV-Vis (ultraviolet visible) spectra were used to ascertain the sources, distribution and biogeochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Duliujian River catchment. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(335)) (CDOM), and hydrophobic components (a(260)) were higher in summer than in other seasons with 53.3 m(-1), while aromaticity (SUVA(254)) was higher in spring. Four fluorescent components, namely terrestrial humic acid (HA)-like (A/C), terrestrial fulvic acid (FA)-like (A/M), autochthonous fulvic acid (FA)-like (A/M), and protein-like substances (Tuv/T), were identified using EEM-PARAFAC modelling in this river catchment. The results demonstrated that terrestrial HA-like substances enhance its contents in summer ARE compared with BRE, whilst terrestrial FA-like substances were newly input in summer ARE, which was entirely absent upstream and downstream, suggesting that rain events could significantly input the terrestrial soil-derived DOM in the ambient downward catchments. Autochthonous FA-like substances in summer BRE could derive from phytoplankton in the downstream waters. The results also showed that DOM from wetland exhibited lower fluorescent intensity of humic-like peak A/C and fulvic-like peak A/M, molecular weight (S-R) and humification index (HIX) during the low-flow season. Built-up land, cropland, and unused land displayed higher a(335) (CDOM). A higher proportion of forest and industrial land in the SCs showed higher SUVA(254) values. Humic-like moiety, molecular weight and aromaticity were more responsive to land use during stormflow in summer. Rainfall could increase the export of soil DOM from cropland and unused land, which influences the spatial variation of HIX. The results in this study highlighted that terrestrial DOM has a significant influence on the biogeochemical alterations of DOM compositions and thus water quality in the downward watershed catchments, which might significantly vary according to the land-use types and their alterations by human activities.

PBDEs are used in a wide range of commercial products as flame retardants and are being assessed internationally as potential persistent organic pollutants. Total PBDE concentrations in the air ranged between 88 and 1250 pg m(-3), and were dominated primarily by the lighter congeners PBDEs 17, 28, and 47, and concentrations of total PCBs ranged between 96 and 950 pg m(-3), and were dominated by the lower chlorinated (tri-to tetra-) congeners. Slopes of Clausius-Clapeyron plots indicate that both PCBs and PBDEs are experiencing active air-surface exchange. Fugacities were estimated from concentrations in the air and leaf-litter and suggest near equilibrium conditions. Following the three-day intensive sampling period, 40 air samples were collected at 24-hour intervals in an attempt to evaluate the effect of bud burst on atmospheric concentrations. Total PBDE concentrations in the daily air samples ranged between 10 and 230 pg m(-3), and were dominated by the lighter congeners PBDE 17, 28, and 47, whereas concentrations of total PCBs ranged between 30 and 450 pg m(-3) during this period. It is hypothesized that the high PBDE concentrations observed at the beginning of the sampling period are the result of an "early spring pulse" in which PBDEs deposited in the snowpack over the winter are released with snowmelt, resulting in elevated concentrations in the surface and air. Later in the sampling period, following bud burst, PBDE concentrations in air fell to 10 to 20 pg m(-3), possibly due to the high sorption capacity of this freshly emerging foliage compartment.					; Jones, Kevin/F-4296-2014; Cousins, Ian/A-6944-2008	Jones, Kevin Christopher/0000-0001-7108-9776; Gouin, Todd/0000-0003-2854-6032; Cousins, Ian/0000-0002-7035-8660													0013-936X					APR 1	2002	36	7					1426	1434		10.1021/es011105k	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es011105k								11999047					WOS:000174789200024

DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE AND HATCHING OF EGGS COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS DEPTHS IN LAKE-SEDIMENTS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Resting eggs (ephippia) of Daphnia galeata, D. hyalina, D. cucullata and D. galeata .times. D. hyalina hybrids were collected from the upper 8 cm of sediments at various water depths from two glacial lakes in the Northern Federal Republic of Germany. The horizontal distribution of ''intact'' ehippia (i.e. those containing two apparently healthy eggs) was extremely patchy, with mean densities in the upper 8 cm ranging from 1325 to 113,907 m-2 (coefficient of variation, C = 65.5%; Schohsee, Holstein) and 25,343-159,143 m-2 (C = 58.5%; Kellersee, Holstein). Ephippial densities were greatest in sediments from deep waters. The highest densities of intact ephippia were in the upper 4 cm of sediment, with progressively fewer with increasing depth. A proportion of eggs obtained from sediments during autumn (September-November 1985) and spring (March-May 1986) were exposed to continuous light (approximately 18 W m-2) at three temperatures (6, 12, 20.degree. C), and the incidence of hatches recorded. Hatching success was consistently low (maximum 14.4%), with most hatching occurring at 12.degree. C. There was no significant difference between the hatching success of ephippia collected during autumn and spring. Decapsulation of ephippal eggs inhibited hatching. Hatching was highly synchronous within each treatment, and the pattern did not differ signficantly with sediment depth, though hatching success was lower in deep sediments. A large reservoir of ephippia is present in lake sediments, of which a proportion may remain viable for many years. Periodic recruitment of hatchlings to the pelagic population may provide an important mechanism for the maintenance of genetic diversity in Daphnia populations, as well as affecting rates of evolutionary change.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1989	22	3					459	470		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01118.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01118.x													WOS:A1989CA92500010

Aquatic plant shows flexible avoidance by escape from tuber predation by swans	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Deeper burial of bulbs and tubers has been suggested as an escape against below-ground herbivory by vertebrates, but experimental evidence is lacking. As deep propagule burial can incur high costs of emergence after dormancy, burial depth may represent a trade-off between sprouting survival and herbivore avoidance. We tested whether burial depth of subterraneous tubers is a flexible trait in fennel pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus), facing tuber predation by Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) in shallow lakes in winter. In a four-year experiment involving eight exclosures, winter herbivory by swans and all vertebrate summer herbivory were excluded in a full-factorial design; we hence controlled for aboveground vertebrate herbivory in summer, possibly influencing tuber depth. Tuber depth was measured each September before swan arrival and each March before tuber sprouting. In accordance with our hypothesis, tuber depth in September decreased after excluding Bewick's swans in comparison to control plots. The summer exclosure showed an increase in tuber biomass and the number of shallow tubers, but not a significant effect on the mean burial depth of tuber mass. Our results suggest that a clonal plant like P pectinatus can tune the tuber burial depth to predation pressure, either by phenotypic plasticity or genotype sorting, hence exhibiting flexible avoidance by escape. We suggest that a flexible propagule burial depth can be an effective herbivore avoidance strategy, which might be more widespread among tuber forming plant species than previously thought.					; Klaassen, Marcel/B-4325-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012; Hidding, Bert/C-3622-2008; Nolet, Bart/C-1416-2008	Nolet, Bart/0000-0002-7437-4879; Klaassen, Marcel/0000-0003-3907-9599; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; 													1439-1791	1618-0089					2012	13	1					50	58		10.1016/j.baae.2011.11.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2011.11.002													WOS:000301277500006

By utilizing continuous eddy system data, the characteristics and mechanisms influencing CO2 flux at various temporal scales in the lake were investigated. Findings revealed that Ngoring Lake was predominantly acting as a carbon sink year-round. The average annual CO2 sink value was maximum in 2016, about -1.46 g C m(-2) d(-1). There were two CO2 absorption peaks in spring and autumn, respectively. The multi-year average monthly mean CO2 absorption peaks occurred in April (-1.70 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and October (-1.75 g C m(-2) d(-1)), respectively. These peaks were associated with the freeze-thaw process and were caused by the mixing process due to water cooling. The continuous warming during the ice-covered period led to a high-water temperature, and the maximum value reached 6 degrees C. In spring, mixing occurred upon ice melt, and the water temperature at 2 m depth decreased rapidly to 4 degrees C because it was about 5 degrees C higher than the air temperature. In autumn, cooling and mixing were induced by decreasing air and water temperatures alongside strong wind. These cooling processes facilitated significant CO2 absorption. The CO2 absorption process was controlled by wind speed, lake ice, lake mixing and stratification.					wang, mengxiao/GYD-6030-2022														2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN	2025	130	6							e2024JG008550	10.1029/2024JG008550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008550													WOS:001499454700001

The aim was to identify their possible pollution sources and evaluate their health risk for human and ecotoxicological risk for aquatic organisms. Results showed that the range of total PAH concentration is 35.38-88.06 ng/L (average 46.57 ng/L) in spring and 25.64-301.41 ng/L (average 76.23 ng/L) in summer. PAH contamination was observed slightly lower in the summer season from the pollution characteristics of water bodies in most areas of the Baiyangdian Lake, and the levels of PAH pollution in the water body of urban residential regions and rural residential regions were relatively higher than those in tourist regions and low human disturbance regions. Source analysis based on diagnostic ratios confirmed that combustion sources and petroleum sources were two main sources for PAHs entering into the waters of the Baiyangdian Lake. Human health risk assessment showed that PAHs in surface waters from the Baiyangdian Lake will not cause a potential non-carcinogenic risk to local residents and the carcinogenic risk could mostly be accepted, but the potential lifetime carcinogenic risk for infants in rural residential regions should be concerned about. Urban residential regions and rural residential regions were subject to higher cumulative non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk when compared to the other functional regions. Ecotoxicological risk assessment found a moderate risk to aquatic organisms presented by individual PAH and a low risk by total PAHs, and PAHs in the water body of urban residential regions and rural residential regions also have relatively higher harm effects to aquatic organisms compared with the other two functional regions. This study revealed the pollution characteristics of PAHs and their possible sources in waters of the Baiyangdian Lake, clarified its correlation to regional anthropogenic activities, and provided corresponding risk management strategies for human and aquatic organisms.					杨, 罗/HHC-5400-2022; Dai, Yi/AAC-1336-2019														0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2021	28	1					574	586		10.1007/s11356-020-10480-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10480-1		AUG 2020						32820436					WOS:000561261700011

Annual repeat spawning was more common than alternate-year spawning. Annual growth, estimated from adult bull trout PIT-tagged in 2000 and recaptured in 2001, averaged 28 mm. Peak diel movement of adult bull trout occurred after sunset. Emigration of juveniles occurred in two pulses, one in spring that was associated with snowmelt runoff and increasing water temperatures and a second in fall as stream temperatures dropped and fall rains began. Juvenile bull trout moved a mean rate of 455 m per night in 2001 and 423 to per night in 2002. Each year we trapped large numbers of age-0 bull trout that appeared to be emigrating with high spring flows. Based on otolith microchemistry, most of the 47 adults in the sample had emigrated at age 3 or age 4, and Done had emigrated at age 0. This suggests that age-0 emigrants are not making a significant contribution to adult returns.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2006	26	1					190	200		10.1577/M04-180.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-180.1													WOS:000236430500023

The aim of this study was to explore the potential use of the laminated sediment from Lake La Cruz as a quantitative climate proxy, by calibrating lamina thickness against instrumental climate data. Statistical analysis of the relation between lamina thickness and the meteorological dataset indicated a high correlation between calcium carbonate lamina thickness and rainfall from December to March (r = 0.725, P < 0.01, n = 35). Winter rainfall anomalies in the area are, in turn, highly negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO, r = -0.832; P < 0.01; n = 53). We propose a regression model to infer past winter rainfall from calcium carbonate laminae thickness. These results highlight new possibilities for paleoenvironmental research using calcite laminated sediment records as climate proxies, especially to study past rainfall variability.					; Romero-Viana, Lidia/L-9572-2014; Miracle, Maria/G-3482-2016; Julia, Ramon/AAB-5373-2019; Camacho, Antonio/I-3417-2015	Vicente-Pedros, Eduardo/0000-0002-8814-9912; Camacho, Antonio/0000-0003-0841-2010													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2008	40	2					703	714		10.1007/s10933-008-9194-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9194-6													WOS:000257329500008

A long-term record of epilimnetic phosphorus patterns in recovering Onondaga Lake, New York	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												A retrospective analysis for a 23 year (1987-2009) record of spectrophotometically determined forms of phosphorus (P) is presented for the epilimnion of Onondaga Lake, New York, a period over which it was transformed from severely culturally eutrophic to mesotrophic through reductions in point source inputs. Patterns of five forms of P were evaluated, total P (TPe), total dissolved P (TDPe), soluble reactive P (SRPe), particulate P (PPe = TPe-TDPe) and dissolved organic P (DOPe = TDPe-SRPe) based on weekly observations from multiple epilimnetic depths for the April (spring turnover) - October (fall turnover) interval of each year. A 10-fold reduction in the effluent concentration of the dominant source (TPMetro), made in several steps, caused dramatic decreases in summer average epilimnetic P concentrations, 6.8-fold for TPe, 4.8-fold for PPe, 14.9-fold for TDPe, 8.4-fold for DOPe, and 70-fold for SRPe, as well as improvements in common metrics of trophic state. Long-term patterns of summer average concentrations of each of these forms tracked the progression of TPMetro at an annual time step. Both short- and long-term patterns of in-lake concentrations, particularly for SRPe, support the position that the lake remained often nutrient-saturated through much of the record, but shifted to distinctly P limited in response to the most recent (2005) reduction in TPMetro. The diagnostic value of monitoring the dynamics of these forms of P at multiple time steps to track lake metabolism and features of the P cycle is demonstrated, including uptake of dissolved forms, effects of Daphnia metabolism, dynamics of phytoplankton uptake, and long-term responses to reductions in external loading. Evidence is presented that a noteworthy fraction of the PPe pool is associated with non-phytoplankton particulates.																			1863-9135					MAY	2010	177	1					1	18		10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0177-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0177-0001													WOS:000283432700001
J	JONES, JG				JONES, JG			SPATIAL VARIATION IN EPILITHIC ALGAE IN A STONY STREAM (WILFIN BECK) WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO COCCONEIS-PLACENTULA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Epilithic algae in a small softwater stream in the English Lake District [UK] were studied using a direct counting epifluorescence technique. A small trickling filter sewage treatment plant discharged into the stream and cattle grazed in fields adjoining the upper reaches. Both increased the inorganic N and P concentrations in the stream but the effect of the cattle was of a more intermittent nature. C. placentula was the dominant diatom but large numbers of encrusting green, blue-green and red algae also occurred in samples from the middle reach, which was heavily shaded by trees in summer. Although it was possible to demonstrate the effect of the sewage effluent on the rate of colonization of clean surfaces placed in the stream, it was only during periods of stable H20 flow that this was reflected in the standing crop of algae on the stones. The Cocconeis counts below the sewage outfall tended to be highest in the autumn whereas those of the other diatoms were highest in the spring. The results were extremely variable and apart from the effect of the nutrient inputs, the Cocconeis standing crops were largely related to the rate of H20 flow. Counts decreased and the variability between and within stones increased as higher rainfall and flow caused instability and scouring of the stones. A similar decrease in standing crop and high variability occurred in conditions of very low H20 flow but this could not be explained.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	6					539	546		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01476.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01476.x													WOS:A1978GD70500004

The reproductive health and seasonal variation of the reproductive end points of razorback sucker populations are currently unknown. Using nonlethal methods, we characterized the plasma hormonal fluctuations of reproductively mature female and male razorback suckers over a 12-month period in a hatchery by measuring their vitellogenin (VTG) and three sex hormones: 17 beta-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and 11-ketotestosterone (KT). Fish were identified as reproductive or nonreproductive based on their body weight, VTG, and sex hormone profiles. In reproductive females, the E2 concentration increased in the fall and winter, and increases in T and VTG concentrations were generally associated with the spawning period. Mean T concentrations were consistently greater in reproductive females than in nonreproductive females, but this pattern was even more pronounced during the spawning period (spring). Consistently low T concentrations (< 3 ng/mL) in adult females during the spawning period may indicate reproductive impairment. In reproductive males, spring increases in KT and T concentrations were associated with spawning; concentrations of E2 (< 0.48 ng/mL) and VTG (< 0.001 mg/mL) were low in males throughout the study. In addition, the E2 : KT ratio and T were the best metrics by which to distinguish female from male adult razorback suckers throughout the year. These metrics of reproductive health and condition may be particularly important to recovery efforts of razorback suckers given that the few remaining wild populations are located in a river where water quality and quantity issues are well documented. In addition to the size, age, and recruitment information currently considered in the recovery goals of this endangered species, reproductive end points could be included as recovery metrics with which to monitor seasonal trends and determine whether repatriated populations are cycling naturally.

A lake called Upvan lake of Thane city, India was investigated during 1996-97 for the purpose. Bacterial population varied with seasonal variations in the water body. Bacterial counts increased during summer months and lowered during winter months. Highest coliform counts were reported in monsoon and lowest in winter season. Samples collected from different sites of the lake showed wide variations in the counts of bacteria. Positive correlation was established between faecal and total coliform. Bacteriological analysis of lake water indicated that water was polluted by faecal contaminants to the extent that it was unportable for drinking purposes and unsuitable from the recreation point of view and hence needed thorough impoundment.

Documentation of Unusual, Fall Spawning by Coastal Cutthroat Trout in the Elwha River System, Washington	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The timing of breeding is a key trait, reflecting selective forces acting on the adults and offspring in the population, contributing to reproductive isolation, and affecting the population's success during rapid environmental change. Salmon and trout populations vary greatly in the peak and range of breeding dates, and timing is a defining trait for salmonid populations. This study reports the occurrence and details of spawning by Coastal Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii in Indian Creek in the Elwha River, Washington, in October and November. This is unusually early in the season for this characteristically spring-spawning species and is much earlier than conspecifics elsewhere in the river system and the region. We hypothesize that the stream's low gradient and lake-dampened hydrologic regime reduced the depth of gravel scouring in the fall, and thus permitted the evolution of such an early breeding date by these small-bodied (ca. 20-35 cm) fish. The exclusion of otherwise sympatric, fall-spawning Coho Salmon O. kisutch for the past century from the habitat by Elwha Dam may also have contributed to this adaptation, and the recolonization by the larger and later-spawning Coho Salmon may have affected the Coastal Cutthroat Trout through redd disturbance.

Biogeochemistry of dissolved carbon, major, and trace elements during spring flood periods on the Ob River	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Detailed knowledge of the flood period of Arctic rivers remains one of the few factors impeding rigorous prediction of the effect of climate change on carbon and related element fluxes from the land to the Arctic Ocean. In order to test the temporal and spatial variability of element concentration in the Ob River (western Siberia) water during flood period and to quantify the contribution of spring flood period to the annual element export, we sampled the main channel year round in 2014-2017 for dissolved C, major, and trace element concentrations. We revealed high stability (approximately <= 10% relative variation) of dissolved C, major, and trace element concentrations in the Ob River during spring flood period over a 1-km section of the river channel and over 3 days continuous monitoring (3-hr frequency). We identified two groups of elements with contrasting relationship to discharge: (a) DIC and soluble elements (Cl, SO4, Li, B, Na, Mg, Ca, P, V, Cr, Mn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba, W, and U) negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with discharge and exhibited minimal concentrations during spring flood and autumn high flow and (b) DOC and particle-reactive elements (Al, Fe, Ti, Y, Zr, Nb, Cs, REEs, Hf, Tl, Pb, and Th), some nutrients (K), and metalloids (Ge, Sb, and Te), positively correlated (p < 0.05) with discharge and showed the highest concentrations during spring flood. We attribute the decreased concentration of soluble elements with discharge to dilution by groundwater feeding and increased concentration of DOC and particle-reactive metals with discharge to leaching from surface soil, plant litter, and suspended particles. Overall, the present study provides first-order assessment of fluxes of major and trace elements in the middle course of the Ob River, reveals their high temporal and spatial stability, and characterizes the mechanism of river water chemical composition acquisition.

Detecting early winter open-water zones on Alaska rivers using dual-polarized C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Northern high-latitude river ice provides critical natural infrastructure for winter travel, commerce, hunting, fishing, and recreation in rural areas with little or no road access. Open water zones (OWZs) in river ice are dangerous for such travel and are most common during early winter. Changes in the occurrence and duration of OWZs may also indicate more widespread shifts in ice regimes across Alaska and other northern regions. To aid in detecting open water hazards and broader changes in winter conditions, we developed a supervised classification with a principal component analysis (PCA) using both polarizations of Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dual-polarized data for rivers in early winter to discriminate between ice cover and open water. Previous SAR river ice classifications have focused on one or two river reaches often with an emphasis on moving ice during spring break-up, hampering generalization of these results to other rivers and seasons. To address this limitation, we used 12 reaches from eight rivers for training and validation with the aim to combine data from different river types to create an ice classification that could be applied to northern high-latitude rivers from October through January. The classification was trained using shore-based time-lapse photos, aerial photos, and on-ice observations, and validated with shore-based time-lapse photos and independent citizen scientists' photo observations. Overall accuracy for the classification ranged from 65 to 93% with a corresponding range of 0.31-0.84 Cohen's Kappa statistic (K). We report some ambiguity between open water and smooth ice, especially in slower-flowing parts of rivers. We conclude that VV and VH thresholds can therefore be customized to increase accuracy, depending on specific river attributes such as river morphology, silt/sediment load, and channel flow velocity. This classification, which allows for mapping long river reaches in low-light winter conditions, can be performed on historical Sentinel-1 imagery to determine areas that display open water year after year. Once customized to a particular river, it can be automated to provide current open water zone maps to Alaskan and other rural northern communities worldwide to aid safer travel on ice.

Here, Mn was found to have the highest mean concentration, with the maximum concentration recorded at IH-2. The heavy metal concentrations were higher during summer and fall than that during spring. The mean concentration of heavy metals was relatively high in the downtown area (1.8 times) and downstream of the wastewater treatment facilities (1.3 times), indicating that the wastewater treatment facilities (WTFs) may be the primary source of pollution. Water at most of the sites were found to be suitable for irrigation. However, the sodium absorption ratio and soluble sodium percentage indicated that IH-2 was unsuitable. The results of the principal component analysis indicated that anthropogenic (vehicle and industrial) activities were the primary sources of metal pollution. Ingestion was identified as the primary exposure pathway in terms of health risks. However, the hazard quotients and hazard index for all pathways were below the safety limit (<1) for children and adults.																				2073-4395				DEC	2022	12	12							3111	10.3390/agronomy12123111	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12123111													WOS:000902140100001

Quantifying the impact of freshwater diatom productivity on silicon isotopes and silicon fluxes: Lake Myvatn, Iceland	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Diatom productivity in the oceans plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle, but is strongly dependent upon the continental silicon supply. However, the relative influence of weathering and biological processes on continental Si fluxes remains poorly constrained. This study aims to quantify the impact of terrestrial diatom productivity on Si fluxes to the ocean. Lake Myvatn in North Iceland is one of the most productive lakes in the Northern Hemisphere, with nutrient-rich waters almost uniquely sourced by groundwater. The primary production is mainly controlled by diatom growth but also by cyanobacteria, and the lake output is via a single river, thereby providing a relatively simple natural laboratory to quantify the impact of diatom growth on the chemistry and Si budget of lake waters. Silicon stable isotopes (delta Si-30) provide a tracer of this biocycling, and have been measured in groundwater inputs to the lake, and in time-series monitoring of waters at the lake outlet. The delta Si-30 values at the outlet range from + 0.70 +/- 0.08 to + 1.42 +/- 0.06 parts per thousand, which is significantly heavier than the groundwater input (average cold and hot springs: + 0.50 +/- 0.17 parts per thousand, 2SD) and consistent with the preferential uptake of light Si isotopes by diatoms. The delta Si-30 value at the outlet increases by up to 0.9 parts per thousand in spring and autumn relative to the Si isotope composition of the inflow. These seasonal diatom blooms can be modeled by an open system of Si uptake and affect Si fluxes at the outlet of the lake by up to 79%, or 53% integrated over the year. In the summer a shift to lighter delta Si-30 values is correlated with a higher pH, which results in dissolution of diatoms releasing light Si isotopes. From mass balance, this seasonal diatom dissolution affects Si fluxes by up to 33%, but is limited to 3.7% integrated over the year. These results clearly illustrate that biological activity can have a significant impact on both isotope composition and elemental abundance of continental derived Si. They also demonstrate the pH dependency of diatom dissolution and/or preservation, which is likely to affect not only the continental Si fluxes to the ocean but also the Si recycling in the oceans themselves.

Our analysis combines the use of high-frequency climate and lake temperature data from 1983 to 2016 in a high-elevation catchment in the Sierra Nevada of California with summer water temperature data from a set of 18 additional lakes scattered throughout the range. Average annual air temperatures warmed at 0.63 degrees Cdecade(-1), but variation in lake temperature was driven primarily by amount of precipitation as snow. By regulating the duration of ice cover and volume of inflowing spring snowmelt, variation in snowpack size accounted for 93% of variation in summer epilimnetic temperatures. The effect of snow on lake temperatures was mediated by variation in elevation and lake depth at landscape scales, creating a predictable mosaic of lake sensitivities to climate warming.

A disharmonious assemblage consisting of coldwater salmon and trout and warmwater sunfish and catfish from the Chalk Hills Formation of the Snake River Plain indicates that the climate of the late Miocene was warm and moist with cool summers and mild winters. Colonization of the lake by deepwater sculpins and whitefish in the Pliocene indicates that the climate was moist and equable, but with summers cooler than either the Miocene or Quaternary. Oxygen isotopic variation among seasonal growth rings in an aragonitic otolith of a Pliocene littoral sunfish suggests a seasonal range of temperatures locally more equable than at present. Extremely depleted values of delta(18)O in carbonates suggest that the lake was maintained by tributaries from high-elevation watersheds, with locally low evaporation, rather than high precipitation.					; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012	Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; 													0031-0182					FEB 28	1994	107	3-4					291	302		10.1016/0031-0182(94)90101-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)90101-5													WOS:A1994NC62800009
J	Xiao, JL; An, ZS				Xiao, JL; An, ZS			Three large shifts in East Asian monsoon circulation indicated by loess-paleosol sequences in China and late Cenozoic deposits in Japan	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Correlations between loess-paleosol sequences in China and late Cenozoic deposits in Japan suggest that the East Asian monsoon circulation experienced three large shifts during the late Cenozoic. About 2.5 Ma ago, the onset of loess accumulation in north-central China accompanied by a dramatic increase in eolian dust flux to the Sea of Japan marked a pronounced development of the East Asian winter monsoon winds. Since ca. 1.2 to 1.1 Ma ago, the obvious alternation of loess and paleosols in the Chinese loess sequence with increased coarse grain-size fraction in the loess units and higher-than-average magnetic susceptibility values in the paleosols, and the repeated occurrence of interstratified marine clay layers in the Osaka Group of central Japan, indicate that the East Asian monsoon circulation strengthened and the contrast between the summer and winter monsoons increased. The paleosols of the Chinese loess sequence were more strongly developed from ca. 550 ka ago, and loess started to accumulate in areas of the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in Lake Biwa of central Japan from ca. 450 ka ago, reflecting more vigorous summer and winter monsoon circulations since ca. 550 to 450 ka ago. These large changes in East Asian monsoon circulation were not only related to the changing solar radiation, global glacial/interglacial cycles and the changing configuration of land and sea but were also directly controlled by the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.

J	Silva, JM				Silva, Junior Melo			STUDY OF THE DOMESTIC SEWAGE TREATMENT PROCESS BY WETLANDS	REVISTA METROPOLITANA DE SUSTENTABILIDADE												Currently the scarcity of water resources in the world has attracted the attention of the researchers, making fundamental the development of technologies for the treatment of sewage generated in human communities. The built flood system is one of these technologies, being a system that has as one of its most important characteristics the ability to remove the nutrients present in the composition of domestic sewage. This removal takes place thanks to the use of aquatic plants installed in a bed that seeks to artificially simulate the natural floodwaters present on the banks of rivers and lakes. The present work monitored for two distinct weeks, which had different climatic seasons (spring and winter), the removal of nutrients, phosphorus and nitrate, present in the effluent of a pilot system of built floods that treated a portion of the sewage generated in the Faculty of Engineering Agricultural University of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), SP, Brazil. This flood was composed of a bed of rectangular surface area (4 x 1m), where there was the cultivation of macrophy of the genus Typha sp. The samples of the effluent and effluent from the floodwaters were collected every one hour within the working range, which was between 8h and 20h. The system presented a mean removal for phosphorus, during winter, of 44.1% and for nitrate of 36.8%. In the spring the average reduction of phosphorus and nitrate was 38.9% and 30.7%, respectively.																			2318-3233					MAY-AUG	2018	8	2					119	134																WOS:000625130200009
J	Hely-Hutchinson, JR; Schumann, EH				Hely-Hutchinson, JR; Schumann, EH			Short-term temperature, wind and current effects in and around Lake Hartbeespoort	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA												Lake Hartbeespoort is subject to an unusual combination of physical conditions, in that it lies in a summer rainfall zone where the weather and climate vary dramatically over time-scales stretching from hours to millennia, the land morphometry is irregular and scum affects radiation absorption in the lake. A study of relationships between winds, temperatures and currents, carried out largely under drought conditions, indicates that air moves over the Hartbeespoort hill/valley-complex in several meso-scale modes of circulation. Wind over the dam-wall is generated by valley-plain processes and intensified by a constriction in the northern end of the gorge. In spite of the small area affected, it tends to dominate the winter water temperature profile, when winds over the main basin, generated by slope processes, are much weaker. However, it seems to exert little seasonal influence on the summer water temperature profile over a monthly time-scale, when there is less difference between the wind-strengths. Nevertheless, wind-impulses in the gorge on many summer nights are strong enough to generate internal seiches, which decay after a single cycle due possibly to absorption both on the rocky bottom and in the irregularly shaped main basin surrounded by reed beds. In response to gorge-winds, a curved path of wind and surface-current was detected in the gorge in winter, leading to a helical water current and a strong inversion, which could be of interest to biologists. Water flows out of the lake roughly at the level of the seasonal thermocline, which would have had the effect of intensifying it. However, some of the inflow also enters around this level, counteracting the outflow effect. This effect, in addition to erosion of the thermocline on the rocky bottom during seiche-action, may account for the rather weak stability that was found in contrast to those of other lakes in the hemisphere.																			0035-919X	2154-0098					1997	52		2				345	362																WOS:000077721800004

Selected limnological variables were investigated in the waters from the upper to the lower littoral regions within the Egeria stand. High light attenuation in the water was observed in July and August in the upper littoral from the development of dense Egeria stand. During the growing and senescing periods (summer and autumn) of the Egeria community, concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), phosphorus (DIP) and B-group vitamins were higher in the upper littoral than in the lower littoral. A decline of chlorophyll-a concentration of phytoplankton toward the upper littoral was observed in May and June. Summer (July and August) decreases of phytoplankton productivity in the upper littoral were correlated with the extremely low photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton in the deep layer of Egeria stand and high light attenuation in the waters.																			0003-9136					SEP	1989	116	3					313	331																WOS:A1989AW48100004
J	Baker, TL; Jennings, CA				Baker, TL; Jennings, CA			Striped bass survival in Lake Blackshear, Georgia during drought conditions: implications for restoration efforts in Gulf of Mexico drainages	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Endemic striped bass Morone saxatilis (Walbaum) populations in Gulf Coast rivers have declined dramatically since the 1940s as a result of anthropogenic activities that limited access to historical spawning areas and adversely affected cool-water springs. Efforts to restore these populations to self-sustaining levels have been under way since the 1950s and continue to the present. In 1998-1999, we fitted 27 adult Gulf-strain striped bass with radio transmitters and released them in Lake Blackshear, Georgia. We used data on their survival, habitat use, and movement patterns to assess the potential long-term survival of fingerling striped bass stocked in this lake since 1996. Overall, we re-located only 27% of tagged fish in cool-water springs, and all radio-tagged striped bass that remained in the lake died during summer. Drought conditions based on rainfall and groundwater withdrawals during the study caused some cool-water springs in Lake Blackshear to stop flowing. Lake temperatures >27degreesC for 13 consecutive weeks, die-offs of non-tagged fish, intermittent spring flows, and widespread mortality of tagged fish suggest that the long-term survival of stocked striped bass in Lake Blackshear probably will be poor. Successful re-introductions of Gulf-strain striped bass to rivers and reservoirs in their historic range will depend on the presence of cool-water springs. The persistence, abundance, and sizes of springs in this region are heavily dependent on the periodicity of droughts and the magnitude of groundwater use. Regional climatological data indicate that droughts occur about every 3 years. Therefore, better management of groundwater withdrawals during drought periods will become increasingly important to maintain aquifer levels (and cool-water springs) needed for restoring native striped bass to Gulf Coast rivers.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JAN	2005	72	1					73	84		10.1007/s10641-004-6585-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-004-6585-z													WOS:000226486100010

The paddy fields often carry substantial methane and nitrate, thus may be a favorable habitat for n-damo bacteria. In this paper, the vertical-temporal molecular fingerprints of M.oxyfera-like bacteria, including abundance and community composition, were investigated in a paddy soil core in Jiangyin, near the Yangtze River. Through qPCR investigation, high abundance of M.oxyfera-like bacteria up to 1.0x10(8) copies (g d.w.s.)(-1) in summer and 8.5x10(7) copies (g d.w.s.)(-1) in winter was observed in the ecotone of soil and groundwater in the paddy soil core, which was the highest in natural environments to our knowledge. In the ecotone, the ratio of M.oxyfera-like bacteria to total bacteria reached peak values of 2.80% in summer and 4.41% in winter. Phylogenetic analysis showed n-damo bacteria in the paddy soil were closely related to M.oxyfera and had high diversity in the soil/groundwater ecotone. All of the results indicated the soil/groundwater ecotone of the Jiangyin paddy field was a favorable environment for the growth of n-damo bacteria.

Over the range of measured variables, Hg and MeHg were most strongly correlated with each other (r(2) = 0.83-0.88) and with dissolved organic C (DOC) (r(2) = 0.64-0.92). Multiple regression models containing DOC and a (DOC x pH) interaction term accounted for 85-90% of the variability in Hg and MeHg between lakes. Observed differences between lakes reflected internal cycling processes and external transport pathways. Internally, high DOC and low pH favored Hg methylation and retention over Hg evasion across the air-water interface. Externally, watershed mapping suggested that the cotransport of DOC, Hg, and MeHg from riparian wetland was also a potentially important process. Observed seasonal differences indicated a 30% increase in MeHg across lakes during summer due to internal or external processes. The effects of DOC on bioaccumulation may be twofold and antagonistic. Although waterborne Hg and MeHg increased with DOC, seston-water partition coefficients tended to decrease, indicating disproportionately more Hg in the dissolved phase. These observations are consistent with previous data on bioaccumulation factors for zooplankton and fish.																			0024-3590					MAY	1995	40	3					556	565		10.4319/lo.1995.40.3.0556	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.3.0556													WOS:A1995RE86200012

NOx concentrations in Salt Lake City, UT (SLC), have decreased significantly since 2000 (-60%). However, during this time minimal declines in O-3 were observed. To better understand the drivers behind O-3 trends in SLC, we leveraged air quality measurements from sites maintained by the Utah Division of Air Quality, along with mobile O-3 measurements collected on top of a light-rail train that traverses the Salt Lake Valley (SLV). Analyses were carried out from March 15th through April (spring) and June through August (summer) for 2019, 2020, and 2021 and focused on the afternoon when O-3 was typically at the highest concentrations (1-4 p.m. MST). Overall, there were large differences in O-3 between the spring and summer months, with the latter being higher by similar to 10 ppb. However, there were relatively small differences in O-3 between weekday and weekend. For the spring, differences in afternoon O-3 concentrations were higher during weekends (<12%), while during the summer, the differences were smaller (1-2%) and higher during weekdays. While weekday vs weekend differences in NOx emissions are usually large (similar to 20%) due to changes in traffic activity, there were relatively minimal differences in O-3 between weekday and weekends. There were minimal differences at point locations such as downtown SLC, and along multiple points along the TRAX train line. The analyses carried out in this study suggests that cities such as SLC are primarily under the influence of VOC-limited chemical regimes, meaning that there is limited O-3 sensitivity to changes in NOx. These results suggest that reducing VOC emissions, would be the most effective approach for reducing O-3 pollution in cities like SLC.

The samples (n = 186) were taken from June to December of 1998. Gas-phase nonylphenol (NP) concentrations at a coastal site (Sandy Hook) ranged from below the detection limit (DL) to 56.3 ng m(-3), while concentrations at a suburban site (New Brunswick) ranged from 0.13 to 81 ng m(-3). Gas-phase concentrations of tert-octylphenol (tOP) ranged from <DL to 1.0 ng m(-3) at Sandy Hook and from 0.01 to 2.5 ng m(-3) at New Brunswick. NPs and tOP exhibited seasonal dependence with higher gas-phase concentrations during summer than during fall and early winter. Temperature explained 40-62% of the variability in the log (gas phase) NP and tOP concentrations. Assessment of the influence of local wind direction on atmospheric NP concentrations provided evidence for the predominance of local sources rather than long-range transport. Based on simultaneous wafer and over-water gas-phase samples and subsequent estimation of air-water exchange fluxes, volatilization and advection to the Atlantic Ocean accounted for 40 and 26% of the removal of NPs from the water column of the LH RE, respectively. The estimated ha If-life of NPs in the water column of the LHRE was 9 days.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 15	2000	34	12					2410	2417		10.1021/es9910715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es9910715													WOS:000087678300006

Seasonal changes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as well as phytoplankton abundance and composition in Shahu Lake from April to July were characterized by three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (3DEEMs) combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. The relationship between the response of components of the DOM and phytoplankton abundance were explored via Pearson correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA) in the overlying water. The results showed that the DOM was composed mainly of tryptophan-like (C2+C4), fulvic-acid-like (C3), humic-acid-like (C1), and tyrosine-like (C5) compounds that accounted for 44.47%, 20.18%, 20.04%, and 15.31%, respectively, of the DOM. The DOM was derived from both endogenous and terrestrial sources. With seasonal changes, endogenous DOM produced by phytoplankton growth and metabolism gradually increased. In spring and summer (April-July), Chl-a concentrations were significantly correlated with C3 (p < 0.01) and C5 (p < 0.05). The concentration of protein-like fractions (C2+C4, C5) were correlated with Cyanobacteria abundance, and the concentrations of humic-like component content (C1, C3) were correlated with the abundance of Xanthophyta, Chlorophyta, and Cryptophytes. Overall, phytoplankton density and Chl-a content increased by 125% and 197%, respectively, and the abundance of C3 and C5 in the DOM increased by 7.7% and 22.15% in parallel. Thus, seasonal phytoplankton growth had an important influence on the composition of the DOM.

Some of these lakes experience anoxic conditions in deep waters. We hypothesised that the increase in temperature and water-column stability observed in these lakes during recent decades influenced the deep-water DO concentration. In particular, we tested whether the thermal regime of the lakes and the depth of mixing affect oxygen replenishment during winter-spring turnover. To this aim, we analysed long-term trends and seasonal variability of oxygen levels in the DSL during 1992-2016. We included in our analysis the effects of environmental variables, such as winter air temperature and atmospheric modes of variability. Our results showed a recent decrease in the deep-water oxygen content in lakes Maggiore, Como and Garda and an increase of the extent of anoxic conditions in lakes Lugano and Iseo. Our results suggest that, beside cultural eutrophication, rising environmental pressures, such as global warming, can influence the future trends of the oxygen levels and ecological states of deep lakes.

Participants were selected from 1118 adult fishers responding to a 1996 screening questionnaire; the study sample (n =132) overrepresented respondents expected to have the greatest and the least exposure to mercury, Tissue mercury concentrations were associated with sportfish consumption: among participants who ate sportfish at least once weekly, hair geometric mean (GM)= 0.82 +/- 2.54 mu g/g and blood mercury GM=3.03 +/- 2.43 mu g/L, compared to hair GM = 0.38 +/- 2.28 mu g/g and blood mercury GM = 1.44 +/- 2.23 mu g/L for those who ate sportfish less than once weekly. While these levels are somewhat higher than those shown for other Greater Lakes and St. Lawrence River fishers, only one participant surpassed the Canadian recommended population mercury limit of 6 mu g/g for hair and 20 mu g/L for blood. Consumption of several sportfish species independently explained much of the variation in measured blood mercury; the predatory species pike was the most important in multivariable regression, Coincident consumption of waterfowl, fishing during the longer summer/fall rather than the brief winter season, and fishers' age were independently associated with blood mercury. Serum selenium related neither to the level of fish consumption nor to the participants' blood mercury.

J	Suriano, ZJ				Suriano, Zachary J.			Nebraska snowfall: a climatological perspective	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Daily observations from a gridded snow dataset are analyzed for the state of Nebraska from 1900 to 2009, evaluating spatiotemporal variability and trends in snowfall throughout the seasonal cycle. Seasonal snowfall totals and event frequencies vary upon on a spatial gradient from northwest to southeast Nebraska, with greater totals and frequencies noted to the north and west. Two homogeneous regions of interest emerged with respect to snowfall trends over the 110-year study period. In north-central Nebraska, seasonal snowfall, autumn snowfall, snowfall frequency, and snowfall magnitude increased with time. The broad increases in snowfall indicate more frequent and more intense snowfall events are generating more snowfall with time, and could be considered when developing snow-based operating budgets. In southeast Nebraska, which includes the state's largest population center of Omaha, snowfall magnitude per event linearly increased by over 50% from 1900 to 2009. The occurrence of more intense, albeit potentially fewer, snowfall events during the winter season may be particularly impactful in association with the city's large population and vehicle dependence. Documenting these variations and trends in snowfall is critical in developing community- and regionally-tailored snow management plans across the state.

Long-term changes in hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen in a large lake: Effects of invasive mussels, eutrophication and climate change on Lake Simcoe, 1980-2012	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Simcoe has been influenced by multiple environmental drivers over the past decades, especially by reductions in phosphorus (P) loading, climate change, and invasive species such as dreissenid mussels (DM) which became firmly established in 1996. We examined the cumulative impact of these drivers on the volume-weighted hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration (VWHDO) below 18 m at station K42 in Kempenfelt Bay during ice-free seasons from 1980 to 2012. Hypolimnetic DO depletion began in early spring when thermal stratification was observable but weak and continued throughout the ice-free season until cooling sufficiently lowered water column stability. In comparison to the pre-DM invasion period (1980-1995), mean annual VWHDOmit was 2.4 mg L-1 higher in the post-DM period (1996-2012), VVVHDOmin was 1.54 mg L-1 higher and the mean duration of the depletion period (L) was 16 days longer. Mean DO depletion rate (DR) and temperature adjusted DO depletion rate (DRadj) were slightly lower (7% and 5%, respectively) after 1996. P controls and DM had a positive effect on VWHDO, presumably by lowering productivity and diverting organic matter away from the hypolimnon. However, longer L apparently offset improvements in VWHDO,in. If lengthening of L associated with regional warming continues, then additional efforts to reduce P loads will be necessary to achieve the goal of maintaining VWHDOmin above the target of 7 mg O-2 L-1 throughout the summer and fall.

Total phosphorus, chlorophyll-a, and Secchi depth, as well as the Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) values based on those three parameters showed characteristic patterns of changes among seasons and years. Within each year, the lowest trophic state was usually observed in winter and the highest in summer. Because of the high loads of phosphorus received by the reservoir, this element did not limit primary production. TSI values calculated on the basis of total phosphorus were always markedly higher than calculated on chlorophyll-a and Secchi depth (similar to each other). The trophic upsurge phase lasted only a few months after the filling of the reservoir in 1990. Similar symptoms were observed after its refilling in the spring of 1993. The trophic depression phase lasted until the end of 1995. After that time a significant correlation between phosphorus concentration in the reservoir and in river waters flowing into the reservoir was observed. The successive phases of reservoir ageing, determined on the basis of phosphorus concentration, were not accompanied by changes in chlorophyll-a content. The influence of the top-down mechanism (biomanipulation effect) resulted in relatively low values of chlorophyll-a after the filling of the reservoir with water in 1990 and in 1993. As early as 1992 chlorophyll-a values reached a very high level and stayed at that level until the end of the study in 2000 (except for the short decline in 1993).

As a consequence of high N balance surpluses and low N use efficiencies (NUEs), nitrogen losses to water bodies and to the atmosphere are high. Field experiments on five replicate farmers' field sites were conducted in southern Jiangsu Province over three consecutive rice-wheat double-crop rotations with three different N fertilization treatments ('conventional' (farmers' practice), 'reduced' (by 23% for rice and 32% for wheat) and zero N application). A parallel survey was carried out involving 43 farmers' households, in order to calculate standard gross margins (SGM) and to conduct an environmental assessment of the rice-wheat farming system in the Taihu Region. The results of the field experiment showed that a distinct reduction in fertilizer N application rates to summer rice and winter wheat crops is possible without significant decrease in mean grain yields. Mean grain yields for the entire double-crop rotation were 14.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) under the conventional N fertilization practice and 14.1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) under reduced N fertilization. A significant increase in NUEs could be achieved in most years and crops under reduced N fertilization compared to farmers' practice, and N balance surpluses were significantly decreased from 142 kg N ha(-1) to less than 60 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) under the reduced N fertilization regime. The residual mineral N contents in the soil profiles after winter wheat harvest showed a decreasing tendency over time with a reduction of N fertilization. Mineral N contents in fertilized fields were significantly higher than on the zero N plots. Concentrations of NH4+-N in soil extracts from the puddled layer during the summer rice in 2010 showed significant differences between the two N fertilization treatments and the zero N plots. Results of the agro-economic survey showed that production of rice was 50% more profitable than that of wheat, and that fertilizer costs made up less than 20% in the rice season, but almost 50% of the total production costs during the wheat season. It can be concluded that N losses to the environment can be efficiently decreased by reducing the overall N fertilization rates without any risk of decline in grain yield and related income for farmers. Based on the field experiments and investigations, a reduction in N fertilizer application rates by 15-25% for summer rice and by 20-25% for winter wheat, compared to present levels is recommended.

Great efforts have been invested to develop remote-sensing-based chl-a retrieval models. However, due to the spatial difference in chl-a concentration, a single model usually cannot accurately predict the whole range of chl-a concentration. To test the performance of precedent chl-a models, we carried out an experiment along the upper and middle reaches of the Kaidu River and around some small ponds in the Bayanbulak Wetland. We measured water surface reflectance in the field and analyzed the chl-a concentration in the laboratory. Initially, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the spectrum band to chl-a concentration with the aim of identifying the most suitable bands for various chl-a models. We found that the water samples could be divided into two groups with a threshold of 4.50 mg/m(3). Then, we tested the performance of 11 precedent chl-a retrieval models and 7 spectral index-based regression models from this study for all the sample datasets and the two separate datasets with relatively high and low chl-a concentrations. Through a complete comparison of the performance of these models, we selected the D3B model for water bodies with high chl-a concentration and OC2 model (ocean color 2) for low chl-a concentration waters, resulting in the hierarchical and piecewise retrieval algorithm OC2-D3B. The chl-a concentration of 4.50 mg/m(3) corresponded to the D3B value of -0.051; therefore, we used -0.051 as the threshold value of the OC2-D3B model. The result of the OC2-D3B model showed a better performance than the other algorithms. Finally, we mapped the spatial distribution and seasonal pattern of chl-a concentration in Bayanbulak Wetland using Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2019. The results indicated that the chl-a concentration in the riparian ponds was generally in the range of 8-10 mg/m(3), which was higher than that in rivers with a range of 2-4 mg/m(3). The highest chl-a concentration usually appears in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and the lowest in winter. The correlation between meteorological data and chl-a concentration showed that temperature is the dominant factor for chl-a concentration changes. Our analytical framework could provide a better way to accurately map the spatial distribution of chl-a concentration in complex river systems.					; Ma, Yuanxu/L-1057-2013; You, Yongfa/LCE-0542-2024	You, Yongfa/0000-0002-8916-2940; Ma, Yuanxu/0000-0003-0551-920X; sun, zhong chang/0000-0003-3219-0542; Sun, Dongqi/0000-0003-4301-2071; liu, weihua/0000-0001-8700-4458														2072-4292				DEC	2022	14	23							6119	10.3390/rs14236119	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14236119													WOS:000897319800001

Holocene palaeoclimate reconstructions at Vanndalsvatnet, western Norway, with particular reference to the 8200 cal. yr BP event	HOLOCENE												Analyses of organic content, magnetic susceptibility, grain size and pollen in sediments from the proglacial lake Vanndalsvatnet in western Norway provide a high-resolution terrestrial record and pollen-based quantitative estimates of mean July and January temperatures and annual precipitation across the similar to 8200 cal. yr BP event. Glaciers in the catchment melted away at approximately 8600 cal. yr BR Immediately following deglaciation, a series of thin minerogenic layers indicate several abrupt, short-lived glacial episodes peaking at similar to 8550, 8450, 8350, 8250, 8200, 7900, 7300 and 7150 cal. yr BR A single, mid-Holocene glacial episode occurred at 4900-4800 cal. yr BR Between 2000 and 1400 cal. yr BP, six short-lived glacial episodes occurred similar to 2000, 1900, 1800, 1700, 1600, and 1500 cal. yr BR The part of Sporteggbreen that drains to Vanndalsvatnet has existed continuously since similar to 1400 cal. yr BP Just prior to a first loss-on-ignition minimum reflecting a glacial episode centred at 8200 cal. yr BP, pollen-inferred July temperatures were relatively high, January temperatures were low, and annual precipitation was relatively low. During the period 8200-7900 cal. yr BP, July temperatures showed a falling trend. Both January temperature and annual precipitation, however, were relatively high. After 7900 cal. yr BP, July temperatures increased, but both January temperatures and annual precipitation were lower than in the preceding period. The pollen analytical and sedimentary data suggest that the glacial advance during the Finse event seems not to have been a response to cooler summers, but to milder winters and increasing precipitation (similar to a positive North Atlantic Oscillation weather mode).

Here, delta O-18(carbonate) are compared to delta O-18(diatom) data from the varved sediments of Nar Goln, a closed lake in central Turkey, over the last 1710 years. Lake monitoring suggests carbonate is probably precipitated during May-June and delta O-18(carbonate) is a proxy for regional water balance. Diatom activity is mainly weighted towards the spring. At times between similar to 301 and 561 AD, while delta O-18(carbonate) values are the highest for the entire 1710 year period, suggesting summer drought, delta O-18(corrected-diatom) values are among the lowest. delta O-18(lakewater) values estimated for the times of diatom growth and carbonate precipitation show large differences. We suggest this could be explained by increased snowmelt that formed a freshwater lid on the lake at the time of peak diatom growth. Increased snowmelt is also inferred similar to 561-801 AD. From 801 AD to the present, precipitation is less winter-dominated, although increased snowmelt is inferred 921-1071 AD and in the latter part of the Little Ice Age (i.e. the mid to late 1800s AD). By combining oxygen isotope data from hosts that form in lakes at different times of the year, we show that such analyses can provide insights into palaeo-seasonality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Anthropogenic Litter Abundance and Accumulation Rates Point to Seasonal Litter Sources on a Great Lakes Beach	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION												The ecology of anthropogenic litter (AL) (i.e., trash) in marine ecosystems is a growing field of research. Freshwater and marine ecosystems have similar AL densities, but research on the assemblage and accumulation rates of AL in freshwater environments is less common. We studied AL accumulation at Pratt beach, located on Lake Michigan in Chicago, IL, USA. The beach has a concrete pier at the south end, with two areas of grass bisected by a walking path. Pratt beach receives many daily visitors, but unlike other urban beaches, it has no daily municipal beach grooming. We established five 60 m transects parallel to the shoreline, with increasing distance to the shoreline. Each transect was divided into four habitat zones (i.e., pier, south vegetation, path, and north vegetation). All AL within 1 m of each transect was collected biweekly from March-November 2015. AL density (No. m(-2)) and input rate (No. m(-2) day(-1)) were highest at the pier, regardless of distance from the shoreline. Fall had the highest AL density relative to spring or summer. We concluded AL inputs at the pier were dominated by direct littering and the retention of wind- and wave-blown AL at the pier's wall. The study beach had much higher AL than adjacent beaches which received municipal AL cleaning, suggesting cleaning is effective at reducing AL density. This study suggests that, given the mobile nature of AL by natural processes, infrequent sampling may underestimate total AL abundance. Management efforts for AL should be directed towards the greatest AL accumulation sites within a beach, and at prevention of direct littering from visitors.

Nevertheless, due to technical limitations, the redistribution of wind-derived energy fuelling turbulence within stratified lakes has only been mapped over short (sub-annual) timescales. Here we present a year-round observational record of energy fluxes in the large Lake Geneva. Contrary to the standing view, we show that the benthic layers are the main locus for turbulent mixing only during winter. Instead, most turbulent mixing occurs in the water-column interior during the stratified summer season, when the co-occurrence of thermal stability and lighter winds weakens near-sediment currents. Since stratified conditions are becoming more prevalent -possibly reducing turbulent fluxes in deep benthic environments-, these results contribute to the ongoing efforts to anticipate the effects of climate change on freshwater quality and ecosystem services in large lakes. During the summer season, turbulent mixing in Lake Geneva is strongest in the interior water-column because stratification limits the reach of wind-driven mixing, suggest meteorological, hydrodynamic and turbulence measurements over a full year.

J	Butler, HG				Butler, HG			Seasonal dynamics of the planktonic microbial community in a maritime Antarctic lake undergoing eutropication	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The abundance, biomass and community structure of phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and protozooplankton in a maritime Antarctic lake were determined at approximately monthly intervals from December 1994 to February 1996 and compared with data from earlier studies. Heywood Lake has become significantly eutrophic during the last three decades because of excreta from the expanding fur seal population in its catchment. Marked seasonal variations in the abundance, composition and productivity of biota were correlated with the seasonality of both physical factors and nutrient levels. Protozooplankton were abundant, diverse and usually dominated by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), with HNF abundance peaking at 2.35 X 10(7) 1(-1) in summer. High numbers of naked amoebae were sometimes present, reaching a maximum of 4.8 X 10(3) 1(-1) in March. An estimated 89 species of protozoa were observed during the study, indicating substantially more diversity than is found in continental Antarctic lakes. Diversity was highest in spring and lowest in winter, when the entire water column became anoxic and the plankton were dominated by bacteria and a few species of relatively large anaerobic flagellates. The current status of the lake is compared with data for continental Antarctic and lower latitude lakes. Earlier studies of biota and physical/chemical parameters in Heywood Lake are used to examine the effects of eutrophication over three decades. Observed changes include increased microbial abundance and changes in both community structure and seasonal patterns.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				DEC	1999	21	12					2393	2419		10.1093/plankt/21.12.2393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.12.2393													WOS:000084287500010

The Guanabara Bay is located inside the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, which is one of the most urbanized and industrialized regions in Brazil. Consequently, this estuarine system is subjected to intense degradation processes due to the eutrophication of the hydrographic systems around the bay. This study aims to investigate the influence of the seasonal variations of environmental factors on the fractionation of phosphorus in the hydrographic basins of the Guapi-Macacu River and the Mangue Channel. The geochemical features of the water and sediments were analyzed, and the interactions between these features, the physicochemical parameters, and the sediment properties of the two basins were identified. Phosphorus fractionation revealed that the various forms of phosphorus displayed distinct behaviors. In the Mangue Channel Basin, the main phosphorus fraction detected during the winter and summer was associated with iron, indicating a reductive environment rich in organic matter (i.e., a polluted environment). In the basin of the Guapi-Macacu River during the winter, the residual phase (P-Re) was predominantly detected, whereas the metallic phase (P-Me) prevailed during the summer. The fractions associated with the physicochemical parameters did not vary significantly in this region, which implies oxidized and natural conditions.

Lake and river samples were collected in the spring and autumn (May and September) of 2003. The Delta C-14 measurements of DOC were performed using the accelerator mass spectrometer at the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES-TERRA), Japan. In September, the C-14 values of DOC were light (around -200%) and did not differ significantly between lake and river water samples, indicating that DOC in Lake Kasumigaura and its tributary rivers yields older C-14 ages than the age expected from the lake-water residence time (average 200 days). This result suggests that terrestrial sources are important contributors to DOC in Lake Kasumigaura. Nevertheless, delta C-13 values indicated that during spring, DOC in the lake is mainly autochthonous. Thus, sources and cycling of DOC in Lake Kasumigaura may vary seasonally.					; YONEDA, Minoru/J-3253-2013; Nara, Fumiko/AAD-8876-2022	Nara, Fumiko/0000-0001-8126-2755; YONEDA, Minoru/0000-0003-0129-8921; 													0033-8222						2007	49	2					767	773		10.1017/S0033822200042648	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033822200042648													WOS:000251221300056

We determined winter distributions, recovery rates, and survival for Canvasbacks banded in Nevada from March to November, 1968-2000. Winter recovery distributions did not differ by sex or age, but differed between direct recoveries (same year as banding) and indirect recoveries (after year of banding), indicating variable site use between years. Of direct band returns (October-March), 92% were from the Pacific Flyway and 56% were from California alone. In California, recovery distributions shifted from southern California and the San Francisco Bay estuary in the 1970s to the Central Valley in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1990s, there were no recoveries in San Francisco Bay, historically the major wintering area for Canvasbacks in the Pacific Flyway. Adult and juvenile survival decreased by 24% between the 1980s and 1990s. Ruby Lake Canvasbacks exhibited weaker fidelity to wintering sites than Canvasbacks wintering on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Moreover, no major concentrations occurred during fall migration, unlike patterns in eastern North America. Shifts in distribution and survival may correspond to effects of El Nino weather on habitat conditions in Nevada and San Francisco Bay, and to major improvements in water delivery and wetland restoration in the Central Valley. Canvasbacks that use widely distributed and variable habitats may be good indicators of the effects of changing climate and water-use practices on waterbirds throughout this and region.																				1938-5129				NOV	2003	105	4					791	804		10.1650/7172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/7172													WOS:000186477400015

These previously undocumented habitat selection patterns raised questions whether differences in crane behaviour such as foraging success existed between the two habitats and how those differences might affect this critically endangered species. Over two winters, we used the density of customary food items (tubers of Vallisneria spp.) obtained from long-term monitoring efforts, Siberian Cranes flock behaviours, individual foraging success and estimated total flock foraging effort across both habitats. Novel foraging patterns by Siberian Cranes were associated with low densities of Vallisneria tubers across multiple sub-lakes within Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve (PLNR). Foraging success was higher in grasslands than in wetlands in winter 2010-2011, but higher in wetlands following a recovery of Vallisneria in 2011-2012. Subsequent to upland foraging during the winter of 2010-2011, we observed lower juvenile to adult ratio of Siberian Cranes at a fall migratory stopover location in north-eastern China despite indications of average environmental conditions in the nesting areas from 2010 to 2012. While grasslands adjacent to shallow-water habitats may be important refugia for wintering Siberian Cranes when Vallisneria is absent or inaccessible, and should be included in protected areas, multi-year dependence on grasslands for foraging could negatively impact population levels. Eliminating crab farming in protected areas and extending protection to shallow water areas sheltered from flooding by dykes could also help secure high quality foraging habitat under a variety of hydrological regimes. Novel foraging patterns by wintering Siberian Cranes represent a new challenge to the conservation efforts for this species that focus on shallow-water wetlands, and may be indicative of broader changes within Poyang's ecosystem.																			0959-2709	1474-0001				JUN	2017	27	2					204	223		10.1017/S0959270916000150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0959270916000150													WOS:000401580200004
J	Reche, I; Pace, ML				Reche, I; Pace, ML			Linking dynamics of dissolved organic carbon in a forested lake with environmental factors	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Dynamics of dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) and capacity to absorb light (color) are determined by in-lake and external properties and processes. In this study, the influence of external factors such as rainfall and solar radiation on DOC and color dynamics was assessed for a small forested lake. DOC and absorption coefficients at 440 nm (a(440)) ranged 4-fold from 0.46 to 1.62 mM and from 3.4 to 14.8 m(-1), respectively. DOC and a(440) varied synchronously, but an important percentage of the variability (26%) in a(440) was not explained by DOC. The resulting twofold variation in the molar absorption coefficient of DOC suggested significant seasonal changes in chromophoric content. Both DOC and a(440) were positive and significantly related to cumulative rainfall. Solar radiation, however, only appeared to influence a(440) dynamics. This influence was mediated by photobleaching. Photobleaching coefficients (k(b)) were higher in fall and spring relative to the summer. This seasonal variability in k(b) values was related to monthly rainfall. The influence of photobleaching on a(440) dynamics was evaluated by comparing the half life of a(440) in the water column with water residence time (WRT). For the study lake, photobleaching contributed notably to a(440) dynamics during the dry periods when WRT was longer than the a(440) half life . DOC dynamics, however, were not related to solar radiation because photomineralization was considerably slower than photobleaching.					; Reche, Isabel/K-7120-2014	Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; Reche, Isabel/0000-0003-2908-1724													0168-2563					OCT	2002	61	1					21	36		10.1023/A:1020234900383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1020234900383													WOS:000178065300002

Seasonally Dynamic Diel Vertical Migrations of Mysis diluviana, Coregonine Fishes, and Siscowet Lake Trout in the Pelagia of Western Lake Superior	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Diel vertical migrations are common among many aquatic species and are often associated with changing light levels. The underlying mechanisms are generally attributed to optimizing foraging efficiency or growth rates and avoiding predation risk (mu). The objectives of this study were to (1) assess seasonal and interannual changes in vertical migration patterns of three trophic levels in the Lake Superior pelagic food web and (2) examine the mechanisms underlying the observed variability by using models of foraging, growth, and mu. Our results suggest that the opossum shrimp Mysis diluviana, kiyi Coregonus kiyi, and siscowet lake trout Salvelinus namaycush migrate concurrently during each season, but spring migrations are less extensive than summer and fall migrations. In comparison with M. diluviana, kiyis, and siscowets, the migrations by ciscoes C. artedi were not as deep in the water column during the day, regardless of season. Foraging potential and mu probably drive the movement patterns of M. diluviana, while our modeling results indicate that movements by kiyis and ciscoes are related to foraging opportunity and growth potential and receive a lesser influence from mu. The siscowet is an abundant apex predator in the pelagia of Lake Superior and probably undertakes vertical migrations in the water column to optimize foraging efficiency and growth. The concurrent vertical movement patterns of most species are likely to facilitate nutrient transport in this exceedingly oligotrophic ecosystem, and they demonstrate strong linkages between predators and prey. Fishery management strategies should use an ecosystem approach and should consider how altering the densities of long-lived top predators produces cascading effects on the nutrient cycling and energy flow in lower trophic levels.

During the spring of 1994, two populations of sea lamprey larvae from two rivers were captured, measured, weighed, implanted with coded wire tags, and returned to the same sites in the streams from which they were taken. Sea lampreys were recovered in the fall, after metamorphosis would have occurred, and checked for the presence of a tag. When the spring data were compared to the fall data it was found that the minimum requirements (length greater than or equal to 120 mm, weight greater than or equal to 3 g, and condition factor greater than or equal to 1.50) suggested for metamorphosis did define a pool of larvae capable of metamorphosing. However, logistic regressions that relate the probability of metamorphosis to size are necessary to predict metamorphosis in a population. The data indicated, based on cross-validation, that weight measurements alone predicted metamorphosis with greater precision than length or condition factor in both the Marengo and Amnicon rivers. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion, weight alone was a better predictor in the Amnicon River, but length and condition factor combined predicted metamorphosis better in the Marengo River. There would be no additional cost if weight alone were used instead of length. However, if length and weight were measured the gain in predictive power would not be enough to justify the additional cost.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			204	213		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70489-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70489-4													WOS:000221321300016

Movement patterns of smallmouth and largemouth bass in and around a Lake Michigan harbor: The importance of water temperature	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu and largemouth bass M. salmoides in southwestern Lake Michigan use shallow, warm harbors for spawning during spring. After the reproductive period ends in early summer, catch rates from standardized sampling of smallmouth bass in harbors decrease. Fishes are presumed to use the main lake during summer but little is known about how black basses use main-lake habitat in Lake Michigan or mechanisms driving this transition. We tracked smallmouth bass (N = 26) and largemouth bass (N = 8) using radio and acoustic telemetry during 2005-2006 near North Point Marina, IL A temperature difference persisted between inside and outside the harbor for much of May-October where harbor temperatures were generally warmer than those outside the harbor. Smallmouth bass responded to water temperature changes, inhabiting the harbor until temperatures outside the harbor approached 18.5 degrees C. at which time they left the harbor. Frequent temperature fluctuations of >3 degrees C occurred outside the harbor within 24-hour periods. Sudden reductions in water temperature were associated with smallmouth bass temporarily returning to the harbor until the temperature outside the harbor again approached 18.5 degrees C. As water cooled during fall, smallmouth bass again returned to the harbor. Largemouth bass exhibited comparatively restricted movements during this time and rarely ranged outside the harbor. Thus, home range estimates for smallmouth bass (142.6 ha) were an order of magnitude greater than those of largemouth bass (12.9 ha). Both water temperature and species played a role in determining the degree of movement outside the harbor but both black basses used the harbor as a thermal refuge.

Clear, crashing, turbid and back - long-term changes in macrophyte assemblages in a shallow lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. During eutrophication, submerged macrophytes in temperate European shallow lakes are thought to undergo a sequence from seasonally stable' conditions characterised by high water clarity in spring and summer, through crashing' conditions where the water is clear in spring but dominated by phytoplankton in late summer, to turbid' conditions with year-round phytoplankton dominance. However, it is not known whether this sequence is reversed during re-oligotrophication and whether this contributes to the often observed delay in macrophyte recovery during lake restoration. 2. We analysed long-term (100years) data on macrophyte species presence, maximum colonisation depth, Secchi depth and seston concentration in shallow Lake Muggelsee during eutrophication from around 1900 and during re-oligotrophication that started in 1990. The current clonal diversity of the dominant species (Potamogeton pectinatus) was investigated to determine whether vegetative dispersal was predominant during its re-establishment. 3. During eutrophication, Lake Muggelsee went through a crashing phase for c.70years with a gradual decline in macrophyte species diversity from c.24 to 5 species. From around 1970, the lake became turbid and was dominated by phytoplankton for the next 20years. Following a reduction in external nutrient loading by 50% from 1990, spring clear-water conditions immediately re-appeared, and P.pectinatus started to re-establish from a few stands that had survived in very shallow areas. By 2011, species diversity had increased to 25 species and maximum colonisation depth had reached 3.2m. Despite a continuing dominance of P.pectinatus, seasonally persistent (Ceratophyllum demersum) and late-season associated (Najas marina) species re-appeared suggesting potential for seasonally stable macrophyte conditions in future. 4. Based on microsatellite analyses, more recently established P.pectinatus stands had lower genotype diversity and were comprised of only a small subset of genotypes from shallower areas, suggesting that vegetative dispersal was more important than seed dispersal for plant re-establishment. We argue that this prevailing reproduction by tubers in combination with negative effects of herbivory and periphyton shading, shown for P.pectinatus in earlier studies in this lake, contributed to the long duration of macrophyte re-establishment.

Thus, aimed at determining the rational irrigation and nitrogen fertilization for spring wheat in this area, field experiments were carried out in the 2019 and 2020 seasons to investigate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen application on soil water and nitrogen status, grain yield, and water and nitrogen use efficiency. Three irrigation levels, i.e., 180, 315, and 450 mm (13, 12 and Ilk and three nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 170, 250, and 340 kg N ha(-1) (N3, N2 and N1) were respectively considered in the experiments. Results indicated that increasing irrigation depth increased root zone soil available water, and increasing nitrogen application could significantly enhance the available nitrogen content in root zone soils and the soil water utilization amount by wheat. Under the control treatment (I1N1), about 25-32% of the applied nitrogen was leached out of the root zone soils throughout the year. Compared to the control treatment, the I2N2 treatment could reduce NO3--N leaching by 32%, and increased the water use efficiency (WUE) and partial factor productivity of nitrogen fertilizer (PFPn) by 33% and 44%, respectively. In addition, the highest yield and net profit of 8078 kg ha(-1) and 1.82x10(4) Chinese Yuan ha(-1) was achieved by the I2N2 treatment, respectively, and it was 6% higher than that of the control treatment. Therefore, considering the grain yield, WUE, PFPn economic benefits and environmental impacts, the strategy of 315 mm irrigation and 250 kg N ha(-1) nitrogen application is recommended for spring wheat in the arid agricultural watershed of Northwest China and areas with similar conditions.					chen, zhijun/HSE-9085-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				FEB 1	2022	260								107277	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107277		OCT 2021											WOS:000719313900003

The flood defence and environmental value of the Ouse Washes depends upon the maintenance of an open grassland which is regularly flooded in winter, but dry enough in summer. ii strategic study of the system was completed in 1995, which recommended that (a) summer flooding should be better controlled and (b) the structures contained within the Washes were improved. This paper considers some of the economic and environmental problems which were encountered during the development of the strategy and examines operational aspects of the design.																			0951-7359					AUG	1998	12	4					254	259																WOS:000075856300004
J	Magoulick, DD; Lewis, LC				Magoulick, DD; Lewis, LC			Predation on exotic zebra mussels by native fishes: effects on predator and prey	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Exotic zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, occur in southern U.S. waterways in high densities, but little is known about the interaction between native fish predators and zebra mussels. Previous studies have suggested that exotic zebra mussels are low profitability prey items and native vertebrate predators are unlikely to reduce zebra mussel densities. We tested these hypotheses by observing prey use of fishes, determining energy content of primary prey species of fishes, and conducting predator exclusion experiments in Lake Dardanelle, Arkansas. 2. Zebra mussels were the primary prey eaten by 52.9% of blue catfish, Ictalurus furcatus ; 48.2% of freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens; and 100% of adult redear sunfish, Lepomis microlophus. Blue catfish showed distinct seasonal prey shifts, feeding on zebra mussels in summer and shad, Dorosoma spp., during winter. Energy content (joules g(-1)) of blue catfish prey (threadfin shad, Dorosoma petenense ; gizzard shad, D. cepedianum ; zebra mussels; and asiatic clams, Corbicula fluminea) showed a significant species by season interaction, but shad were always significantly greater in energy content than bivalves examined as either ash-free dry mass or whole organism dry mass. Fish predators significantly reduced densities of large zebra mussels (>5 mm length) colonising clay tiles in the summers of 1997 and 1998, but predation effects on small zebra mussels (less than or equal to5 mm length) were less clear. 3. Freshwater drum and redear sunfish process bivalve prey by crushing shells and obtain low amounts of higher-energy food (only the flesh), whereas blue catfish lack a shell-crushing apparatus and ingest large amounts of low-energy food per unit time (bivalves with their shells). Blue catfish appeared to select the abundant zebra mussel over the more energetically rich shad during summer, then shifted to shad during winter when shad experienced temperature-dependent stress and mortality. Native fish predators can suppress adult zebra mussel colonisation, but are ultimately unlikely to limit population density because of zebra mussel reproductive potential.					; Magoulick, Daniel/AAG-1556-2020	Magoulick, Daniel/0000-0001-9665-5957; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2002	47	10					1908	1918		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00940.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00940.x													WOS:000178347100009
J	Dark, P; Allen, JRL				Dark, P; Allen, JRL			Seasonal deposition of Holocene banded sediments in the Severn Estuary Levels (southwest Britain): palynological and sedimentological evidence	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Banded sediments outcrop widely in the intertidal zone of the Severn Estuary and have been suggested, on the basis of textural analysis, to have formed in response to seasonal variations in sea temperature and windiness (Holocene, 14 (2004) 536). Here palynological and sedimentological analyses of banded sediments of mid-Holocene date from Gold Cliff, on the Welsh side of the Severn Estuary, are combined to test and further develop the hypothesis of seasonal deposition. Pollen percentage and concentration data are presented from a short sequence of bands to establish whether textural variations in the bands coincide with variations in pollen content reflecting seasonal flowering patterns. It is shown that fine-grained band parts contain higher total pollen concentrations, and a higher proportion of pollen from late spring- to summer-flowering plants, than coarse-grained band parts. Pollen in the coarser deposits appears primarily to reflect deposition from the buffering `reservoir' of suspended pollen in the estuarine water-body and from rivers, when there is little pollen in the air in winter, while the finer sediments contain pollen deposited from the atmosphere during the flowering season, superimposed on these `background' sources. The potential of such deposits for refining chronologies and identifying seasonality of coastal processes is noted, and the results of charcoal particle analysis of the bands presented as an example of how they have the potential to shed light on seasonal and annual patterns of human activity.

Salgados is a hypereutrophic intermittently open coastal lagoon, which received freshwater inputs from small rivers and from a wastewater treatment plant. Cyanophyceae dominated the phytoplankton communities most of the time; Bacillariophyceae became the main taxonomic group in winter when the lagoon was closed; Chlorophyceae was the major class in early summer; pico-nano flagellate algae accounted for a high percentage of total phytoplankton during spring. Potentially harmful taxa were observed during most of the sampling periods, forming blooms and accounting for a considerable percentage of total phytoplankton abundance. A strong differentiation among dry and wet seasons could be noticed. The dry season was dominated by Microsystis aeruginosa, Rhodomonas sp., pico-nano flagellate algae, Cyclotella spp. and Planktothrix sp., while the wet season, although still with the presence of Microsystis aeruginosa, was dominated by Dolichospermum spiroides. The best environmental variables explaining stations patterns and based on phytoplankton taxa were days of isolation, pH, and salinity. Temperature, cumulative rain and total phosphorus were also related with species and stations patterns. The high nutrient load in Salgados lagoon promoted the development and persistence of harmful algae blooms. Proper management of coastal lagoons involves not only the control of direct discharges of nutrients, but also of other factors, including water level and communication with the sea.

SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION IN RELATION TO THERMAL STRATIFICATION AND HYPOLIMNETIC ANOXIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An investigation into the spatial and temporal distribution of ciliate populations in a small monomictic eutrophic lake was carried out over a 1-yr period. A community of large ciliates dominated by Loxodes striatus, L. magnus, Spirostomum teres and Frontonia leucas occurred in the deep water sediment during the period of winter mixis. These cilates vacated the sediment during summer stratification, progressively colonizing the hypolimnion in phase with the upwards spread of anoxic conditions, returning to the sediment following destratification. The possible significance of this ciliate community is discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	124	2					167	176		10.1007/BF00006798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006798													WOS:A1985AKJ4400008

J	Saarni, S; Saarinen, T; Lensu, A				Saarni, Saija; Saarinen, Timo; Lensu, Anssi			Organic lacustrine sediment varves as indicators of past precipitation changes: a 3,000-year climate record from Central Finland	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Annually laminated (varved) sediments from Lake Kallio-Kourujarvi, Central Finland, provide high-resolution sedimentological data for the last three millennia. These varves consist of two laminae that represent (1) deposition during the spring-to-autumn growing season, composed of degraded organic matter and a variety of microfossils, and (2) deposition during winter, composed of fine-grained homogenous organic matter. Because of the absence of a clastic lamina, these varves differ from the typical, well-described, clastic-organic varve sequences in Fennoscandian lakes. Such organic varves in Finnish lakes have not been studied in detail before. Three thousand varves were counted and their seasonal deposition was distinguished. Comparison of varve thickness with meteorological data revealed a positive correlation between organic varve thickness and precipitation. This suggests that catchment erosion processes and consequent organic matter and nutrient inputs are important factors in organic varve formation. The correlation between temperature and growing-season lamina thickness varied from insignificant, to positive, to negative during different time spans. This suggests that organic matter accumulation can sometimes have a significant, but unpredictable role in organic varve formation, via organic matter production and degradation, processes that are influenced strongly by water column temperature. The organic varves of Lake Kallio-Kourujarvi enable a unique, high-resolution approach for the study of past climate and environment. Our results suggest that decadal periods of increased precipitation occurred during BP 2150-2090, 1710-1620, 1410-1360, 920-870 (1030-1080 AD), and after 370 BP (1580 AD). Dryer intervals occurred during BP 2750-2720, 1900-1850, 1800-1740, 1600-1500, and 780-700 (1170-1250 AD), 590-520 (1360-1430 AD).

As a consequence of this phenomenon, the western coast of the Sambian Peninsula of the Kaliningrad Oblast (Russia) was subjected to devastating effects: partial washout of the beach, flooded recreational infrastructure, the direction of the water flow changed and the formation of a local canyon, the dam of a flooded quarry broke through and was completely destroyed. The methodology for the integrated use of field measurement data, meteorological and hydrological information, re-analysis data, as well as satellite images was developed in order to analyses the effects of storms on inland coastal water bodies. Almost all storm events caused sea levels to rise, which had a devastating effect on the coast. As a consequence of the initial storm in October 2023, the inland water body was entirely obliterated, first becoming part of the sea and then a sandy beach. The most significant event was a series of storms in January and February 2024, which resulted in a 90 cm increase in the level rise relative to the pre-storm period. The storms brought with them a vast amount of precipitation, amounting to 51% of the total during the cold period. Rising sea levels and heavy precipitation caused the flooding of coastal lagoon lakes, changes in their thermohaline and oxygen regimes, as well as flooding of adjacent infrastructure.					; Kileso, Aleksandr/L-3200-2016; Domnin, Dmitry/JOK-0457-2023; Kileso, Alexander/L-3200-2016	Domnin, Dmitry/0000-0001-8627-2055; Kileso, Alexander/0000-0002-3968-9373													0033-4553	1420-9136				AUG	2024	181	8					2403	2420		10.1007/s00024-024-03526-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-024-03526-9		JUN 2024											WOS:001257039900001

Augmentation of seasonal low stream flows by artificial recharge in the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie aquifer of Idaho and Washington, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater requires sophisticated spatial and temporal analysis. In situations involving multiple jurisdictions such as state boundaries, management problems are magnified due to often conflicting regulations and policies. A transient MODFLOW model of the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie (SVRP) aquifer/river system mutually accepted by both the states of Idaho and Washington, USA, was used to evaluate regional solutions to potential water shortages through the use of strategically placed infiltration basins or injection wells. Artificial recharge of the SVRP aquifer was simulated using diversions from Lake Pend Oreille during winter periods when flows are high and excess water is available. Alternative locations for potential wells and detention basins were examined. Lag times for the water to impact stream/groundwater interaction areas along the Spokane River were evaluated to assess the potential for augmenting stream flows from July through September. Results indicated that the aquifer could be used to improve low-flow season streamflow values utilizing both infiltration basins and injection wells with winter surface water diversions. Depending on the location, as much as 30% of the winter diversion rate could be lagged to improve summer flows at the Spokane gage. Thus, a regional mitigation strategy is scientifically feasible.																			1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2009	17	6					1459	1470		10.1007/s10040-009-0467-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-009-0467-6													WOS:000269013500010

Spatiotemporal distributions and relationships of phosphorus content, phosphomonoesterase activity, and bacterial phosphomonoesterase genes in sediments from a eutrophic brackish water lake in Chile	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Phosphorus (P) cycling by microbial activity is highly relevant in the eutrophication of lakes. In this context, the contents of organic (Po) and inorganic (Pi) phosphorus, the activity of acid (ACP) and alkaline (ALP) phosphomonoesterase (Pase), and the abundances of bacterial Pase genes (phoD, phoC, and phoX) were studied in sediments from Budi Lake, a eutrophic coastal brackish water lake in Chile. Our results showed spatiotemporal variations in P fractions, Pase activities, and Pase gene abundances. In general, our results showed higher contents of Pi (110-144 mg kg- 1), Po (512-576 mg kg-1), and total P (647-721 mg kg- 1) in sediments from the more anthropogenized sampling sites in summer compared with those values of Pi (86-127 mg kg- 1), Po (363-491 mg kg- 1) and total P (449-618 mg kg- 1) in less anthropogenized sampling sites in winter. In concordance, sediments showed higher Pase activities (mu g nitrophenyl phosphate g-1 h-1) in sediments from the more anthropogenized sampling sites (9.7-22.7 for ACP and 5.9 to 9.6 for ALP) compared with those observed in less anthropogenized sampling sites in winter (4.2-12.9 for ACP and 0.3 to 6.7 for ALP). Higher abundances (gene copy g-1 sediment) of phoC (8.5-19 x 108), phoD (9.2-47 x 106), and phoX (8.5-26 x 106) genes were also found in sediments from the more anthropogenized sampling sites in summer compared with those values of phoC (0.1-1.1 x 108), phoD (1.4-2.4 x 106) and phoX (0.7-1.2 x 106) genes in the less anthropogenized sites in winter. Our results also showed a positive correlation between P contents, Pase activities, and abundances of bacterial Pase genes, independent of seasonality. The present study provided information on the microbial activity involved in P cycling in sediments of Budi Lake, which may be used in further research as indicators for the monitoring of eutrophication of lakes.					; Bai, Junhong/V-1993-2019; Jorquera, Milko/B-7378-2011; Campos Burgos, Marco/AAP-7666-2020	Campos Burgos, Marco Antonio/0000-0001-5334-2053; Pena-Cortes, Fernando/0000-0002-0489-1555; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 15	2022	320								115906	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115906		AUG 2022						36056497					WOS:000848489200001
J	Hansen, AG; Beauchamp, DA				Hansen, Adam G.; Beauchamp, David A.			Latitudinal and photic effects on diel foraging and predation risk in freshwater pelagic ecosystems	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Clark & Levy (American Naturalist, 131, 1988, 271-290) described an antipredation window for smaller planktivorous fish during crepuscular periods when light permits feeding on zooplankton, but limits visual detection by piscivores. Yet, how the window is influenced by the interaction between light regime, turbidity and cloud cover over a broad latitudinal gradient remains unexplored. We evaluated how latitudinal and seasonal shifts in diel light regimes alter the foraging-risk environment for visually feeding planktivores and piscivores across a natural range of turbidities and cloud covers. Pairing a model of aquatic visual feeding with a model of sun and moon illuminance, we estimated foraging rates of an idealized planktivore and piscivore over depth and time across factorial combinations of latitude (0-70 degrees), turbidity (01-5 NTU) and cloud cover (clear to overcast skies) during the summer solstice and autumnal equinox. We evaluated the foraging-risk environment based on changes in the magnitude, duration and peak timing of the antipredation window. The model scenarios generated up to 10-fold shifts in magnitude, 24-fold shifts in duration and 55-h shifts in timing of the peak antipredation window. The size of the window increased with latitude. This pattern was strongest during the solstice. In clear water at low turbidity (01-05 NTU), peaks in the magnitude and duration of the window formed at 57-60 degrees latitude, before falling to near zero as surface waters became saturated with light under a midnight sun and clear skies at latitudes near 70 degrees. Overcast dampened the midnight sun enough to allow larger windows to form in clear water at high latitudes. Conversely, at turbidities 2 NTU, greater reductions in the visual range of piscivores than planktivores created a window for long periods at high latitudes. Latitudinal dependencies were essentially lost during the equinox, indicating a progressive compression of the window from early summer into autumn. Model results show that diel-seasonal foraging and predation risk in freshwater pelagic ecosystems changes considerably with latitude, turbidity and cloud cover. These changes alter the structure of pelagic predator-prey interactions, and in turn, the broader role of pelagic consumers in habitat coupling in lakes.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				MAR	2015	84	2					532	544		10.1111/1365-2656.12295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12295								25266197					WOS:000349968700020

Moreover, environmental factors may be the primary driver of bloom outbreaks. Studying the characteristics and driving factors of the evolution of cyanobacterial blooms can provide a scientific basis for the restoration of lake water environments and aquatic ecosystems. Based on the Landsat extended time series and practical ecological investigation, this study determined the bloom area and dominant species of cyanobacterial blooms in Hulun Lake, and analyzed their evolution characteristics and primary influencing factors. The results show that the area of bloom outbreak tended to decrease from 2018 to 2020, with the peak area remaining below 150 km2; in contrast, the bloom area showed an increasing trend in 2021-2022, with a maximum of 1970.55 km2 in June 2022. Pearson correlation analysis of bloom area and driving factors showed that the wind speed was the main influencing factor of bloom outbreaks. In 2022, there were five dominant species of cyanobacteria in summer and three in autumn. Redundancy analysis of the dominant species of cyanobacteria and water quality indicators showed that COD, DO, TP, WT, pH, and TN were the main influencing factors of the dominant species of cyanobacteria in summer, and COD, DO, TP, and WT were the main influencing factors in autumn. In general, cyanobacteria in Hulun Lake are sensitive to changes in wind speed and nutrient concentration. An important approach towards effectively reducing the intensity of cyanobacterial blooms in Hulun Lake and coping with the ecological risks associated with the changing environment would be to reduce external loads and regulate the ecosystem structure of the lake. In the future, while studying the law of cyanobacterial bloom outbreaks, attention should be paid to the impact of the cyanobacterial physiological status on bloom outbreaks.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024; Liu, Yu/HNQ-3822-2023; Wang, Shihuan/OBO-1586-2025; guohua, li/ABD-4825-2020															2073-4441				NOV	2023	15	21							3765	10.3390/w15213765	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15213765													WOS:001099514200001

PFAS concentrations were higher in spring than in the other three seasons (p < 0.01); however, there was no significant spatial distribution (p > 0.05). Redundancy analyses showed that environmental factors explained the distribution of PFASs (R-2 = 0.47), with PFOA, PFOS, PFBA, and Sigma PFASs mainly associated with particulate matter entering the lake, while PFBS and PFHxS were linked to industrial sources. Multiple linear regression revealed a strong correlation between PFASs and environmental factors (R-2 = 0.68), with TC, chi(ARM), and chi(ARM)/chi showing negative correlations, and chi and SIRM showing positive correlations. Compared with XGBoost, CatBoost, SVM, and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), the random forest demonstrated the best performance for different PFASs simulation (R-2 = 0.85 on average). Incorporating spatial information into ML enhanced the R-2 by >20 %. Lake environmental chemical factors predominated (58.87 %), followed by magnetic factors (32.57 %) on PFASs simulation, based on feature importance. Partial dependence plots showed that when total carbon <6 g/kg or chi(ARM)/chi < 10 x 10(3)A/m, they were negatively correlated with PFAS concentration. Force plots indicated PFAS increasing attributable to exogenous particle inputs, and the decreasing in autumn and winter may reflect internal transformations and particle movements. This study deciphered complex seasonal PFAS dynamics in sediments, and highlights the lifecycle mechanism requiring consideration in PFAS seasonal distribution and influence factors.

J	Cargnelli, LM; Gross, MR				Cargnelli, LM; Gross, MR			Fish energetics: Larger individuals emerge from winter in better condition	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We tested the hypothesis that larger individuals in a temperate fish population emerge from winter in better energetic condition than do smaller individuals. We sampled adult male bluegills Lepomis macrochirus in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, after spring ice break and just before active feeding began. By extracting neutral and membrane-bound polar lipids, we estimated the energetic condition of each individual. We found that both the mass of lipids and the lipids per gram of body weight were significantly and positively correlated with body size. These results are attributed to the allometric relationships between body size and energy reserves and between body size and metabolic rate. Body size, therefore, profoundly affects energetic state, which may explain why individuals of different size vary in their reproductive behavior and survivorship.																			0002-8487					JAN	1997	126	1					153	156		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0153:NFELIE>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0153:NFELIE>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997WK86900013

Intensified monsoon and spatiotemporal changes in precipitation patterns in the NW Himalaya during the early-mid Holocene	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												We have undertaken a high resolution palaeoclimate reconstruction on radiocarbon dated palaeolake sediments from the Spiti valley, NW Himalaya. This site lies in the climatically sensitive winter westerlies and Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) transitional regime and provides an opportunity to reconstruct the precipitation seasonality, and extreme precipitation events that are characterised by intensified erosion. The lake sediments reveal distinct lithofacies that provide evidence of changes in depositional environment and climate during early to mid Holocene (8.7-6.1 cal ka BP). We have identified three stages during the period of lake's existence: the Stage I (8.7-7.6 cal ka BP) is marked by lake establishment; Stage II (similar to 7.6-6.8 cal ka BP) by sustained cooler periods and weakened summer monsoon, and Stage III (similar to 6.8-6.1 cal ka BP) by a shift from colder to warmer climate with stronger ISM. We have identified several short term cooler periods at ca. 8.7, 8.5, 8.3 and 7.2-6.9 cal ka BP. Based on an overview of regional climate records we show that there is an abrupt switch in precipitation seasonality ca. 6.8 cal ka BP that is followed by the onset of the intensified monsoon in the NW Himalaya.

In most underdeveloped nations, such as Kosovo, obtaining information on the current state and dynamic changes in the environment for quick monitoring is difficult. The current study examines droughts in the study area's manmade lake in Prishtina. The study's major goal is to provide a little-known and used alternative in Kosovo for monitoring and evaluating seasonal variations in water level utilizing WRI (Water Ratio Index) and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) time series outputs, which also are mathematic formulas. Images from the satellite were incorporated in the research. According to the findings of this study, the WRI and NDWI created data and photos that provide us with useful information regarding water droughts. The purpose of this research is to create a clearer picture and data regarding the severity and timing of droughts. The results of this study are presented in statistical tables as well as with images over the seasons using the formulas WRI and NDWI and supervised classification algorithm which is Maximum Likelihood. We found that WRI is slightly more accurate than NDWI. NDWI was taking some soil and roads as water. We have generated water level statistics during the seasons of 2019, in the Spring the water level is 134.27 hectares, in the Summer is 124.68 hectares and in Autumn is 112.11 hectares. This information may also be used to produce a forecast of when droughts are likely to occur during the seasons, allowing for proactive measures to prevent lake erosion.

J	Burg, JG				Burg, JG			Seasonal activity and spatial distribution of host-seeking adults of the tick Dermacentor variabilis	MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY												The seasonal temporal and spatial distribution and emergence of overwintering and summer cohorts of host-seeking American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae), adults were examined for 5 years in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. Weekly drag cloth sampling was conducted from early March until late September 1992-1995 and early March until the end of May 1996. Overwintering adult cohorts became active in early to mid-April followed by bimodal host-seeking activity each year, with the duration and intensity of the first activity period being related to the previous year's summer cohort activity. The first activity peak extended from mid-April through late May and the second activity peak occurred in July. All host-seeking activity ceased by early August, except in 1995, when activity ended on 22 August. Laboratory survival of adults, collected weekly during 1993-1996, was used to estimate the emergence of summer adult cohorts. Summer adult cohorts became active in late May or early June and overlapped with overwintering adult host-seeking activity. The termination of host-seeking activity in overwintering adults could not be determined using the methods employed in this study and is most likely to have continued for the entire season. Host-seeking adults displayed contagious distribution patterns along trails bordering ecotone habitats, as determined by fitting a negative binomial frequency distribution to weekly sampling data. These patterns did not vary from year to year. In addition, the location of D. variabilis activity did not change from year to year, which suggests that microhabitats within apparently homogeneous environments enhance adult survival and lead to 'hot spots' of tick activity despite the ability of vertebrate hosts to disperse D. variabilis populations more widely. These data better define our understanding of D. variabilis adult seasonal and spatial host-seeking activity, estimate for the first time the intensity of summer cohort host-seeking activity, and relate summer cohort activity with spring activity the following year.																			0269-283X					DEC	2001	15	4					413	421		10.1046/j.0269-283x.2001.00329.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0269-283x.2001.00329.x								11776460					WOS:000172903600008
J	Choudhury, A; Bruch, R; Dick, TA				Choudhury, A; Bruch, R; Dick, TA			Helminths and food habits of lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens from the Lake Winnebago system, Wisconsin	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Eight species of helminths were recovered from 45 summer (June-August) and 29 winter (February) lake sturgeon adults and juveniles, from Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin. Eighteen young-of-the-year (YOY) sturgeon collected from the wolf River were uninfected. Both summer and winter helminth communities were dominated by host specific parasites such as Creidostomum auriculatum, Skrjabinopsolus manteri, Capillospirura pseudoargumentosa and Truttaedacnitis clitellarius. Examination of stomach contents indicated the chironomids were the most important food items and comparison with past records on lake sturgeon diet suggests and unchanged use of the benthos of Lake Winnebago. The eutrophic nature of Lake Winnebago is probably responsible for the absence of Hexagenia spp, an important component of the diet of lake sturgeon from other systems, which would explain the absence of a host specific nematode, Spinitectus acipenseri. Although the trophic status of the lake may modify the helminth community, some host specific endo-helminths (C-ariculatum, C-pseudoargumentosa) appear to be transmitted in riverine environments (deeper downstream channels) used as feeding areas by older (2 yr+) sturgeon. Differences in habitat and diet of YOY sturgeon in the Wolf River and the absence of any host specific helminths in these juveniles also indicate that the community of host specific helminths is not recruited until YOY juveniles enter deeper downstream channels to feed.																			0003-0031					APR	1996	135	2					274	282		10.2307/2426710	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426710													WOS:A1996UG15200010
J	Lake, SJ; Brush, MJ				Lake, Samuel J.; Brush, Mark J.			Contribution of Nutrient and Organic Matter Sources to the Development of Periodic Hypoxia in a Tributary Estuary	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The seasonal formation of periodic hypoxia within tributary estuaries is influenced by multiple nutrient and organic matter sources, both autochthonous and allochthonous. In contrast to lakes and flowing rivers, allochthonous inputs to estuaries include those from near-field sources in the watershed as well as far-field sources from adjacent marine systems that contribute nutrients, organic matter, and hypoxic water via estuarine circulation. This study utilized a reduced-complexity eutrophication model to quantify the contribution of individual sources to hypoxia in the York River estuary (YRE), and assess the reductions necessary to mitigate hypoxic conditions. Results indicate that portions of the oligohaline YRE are influenced by organic loading from the watershed, while the lower mesohaline region is influenced by both internal phytoplankton production and watershed loads. In the high mesohaline, watershed organic matter and internal phytoplankton production play an equally important role during the spring; however, in summer and fall oxygen concentrations appear to respond strongly to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) entering via advection from Chesapeake Bay (CB). The polyhaline region, which is frequently the site of reoccurring hypoxia, responded primarily to advected DOC from CB. Results indicate that different regions of the YRE may require different management strategies, and highlight the strong relationship between periodic hypoxia in the lower YRE and advection of labile organic matter from CB, a far-field input that requires a regional management approach. A cross-system comparison of nutrient budgets indicates that far-field sources can comprise a large portion of total system inputs in numerous tributary estuaries.

J	Snowball, I; Zillén, L; Gaillard, MJ				Snowball, I; Zillén, L; Gaillard, MJ			Rapid early-Holocene environmental changes in northern Sweden based on studies of two varved lake-sediment sequences	HOLOCENE												Mineral magnetic, organic carbon and pollen studies of two varved Holocene lake-sediment sequences in the boreal forest of northern Sweden indicate that significant environmental changes took place between c. 6000 and 5700 BC. This interval is characterized by an increase in mineral-matter accumulation, which is a proxy for winter-snow accumulation, and a statistically significant decrease in total pollen influx (predominantly Pinus, Betula and Alnus), which may reflect lower spring and summer temperatures and increased frost frequency. Notable increases in the influx of deciduous tree species (including Quercus and Corylus) suggest a rapid change to warmer conditions between 5700 and 5600 BC. Given dating errors associated with the varve chronologies and the Greenland ice-core timescales, the cold interval can be considered to reflect a regional (possibly global) climatic cooling, which is often referred to as the '8.2 kyr BP cooling event'. However, the younger age of the cold event in northern Sweden does not support the hypothesis of forcing by the sudden drainage of Laurentide glacial lakes into the North Atlantic, unless a minimal 300-year delay in ocean-atmospheric coupling is accepted. The data contribute to a complex picture of early-Holocene environmental change, in response to deglaciation of the Northern Hemisphere.					; Gaillard, Marie-José/ABG-2680-2021	Snowball, Ian/0000-0002-6257-3088; 													0959-6836						2002	12	1					7	16		10.1191/0959683602hl515rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683602hl515rp													WOS:000172904400002

A set of models describing the dynamics of top-down control of phytoplankton by Daphnia in lakes is reviewed. The basis of these models is a simple and well-known model that has been used, among other things, to demonstrate the paradox of enrichment. 2. We discuss minimal extensions that allow this model to mimic the effects of spatial heterogeneity, planktivory, seasonality and inedible algae. 3. These models generate hypotheses about mechanisms that may cause patterns observed in the field such as: Spatial heterogeneity stabilizes plankton dynamics, and causes enrichment to result in a gradual increase of both zooplankton and algal biomass. Daphnia populations can collapse at a threshold level of predation pressure from fish, rather than gradually become less abundant. Absence of Daphnia in summer may typically be caused by the combination of food shortage followed by suppression by fish. The spring clear-water phase and various other aspects of the typical seasonal dynamics of Daphnia and algal biomass can simply be explained from the seasonal rise and fall of rates of biological processes and the reproduction cycle of fish. Depending on the conditions, cyanobacterial dominance can be stimulated but also suppressed by Daphnia. 4. We discuss the way in which such very simple models may contribute to the building of theories about plankton dynamics in the field, and the caveats of interpreting wrongly the message from models.

J	Ivanov, M; Warrach-Sagi, K; Wulfmeyer, V				Ivanov, Martin; Warrach-Sagi, Kirsten; Wulfmeyer, Volker			Field significance of performance measures in the context of regional climate model evaluation. Part 1: temperature	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												A new approach for rigorous spatial analysis of the downscaling performance of regional climate model (RCM) simulations is introduced. It is based on a multiple comparison of the local tests at the grid cells and is also known as "field" or "global" significance. New performance measures for estimating the added value of downscaled data relative to the large-scale forcing fields are developed. The methodology is exemplarily applied to a standard EURO-CORDEX hindcast simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the land surface model NOAH at 0.11 (ay) grid resolution. Monthly temperature climatology for the 1990-2009 period is analysed for Germany for winter and summer in comparison with high-resolution gridded observations from the German Weather Service. The field significance test controls the proportion of falsely rejected local tests in a meaningful way and is robust to spatial dependence. Hence, the spatial patterns of the statistically significant local tests are also meaningful. We interpret them from a process-oriented perspective. In winter and in most regions in summer, the downscaled distributions are statistically indistinguishable from the observed ones. A systematic cold summer bias occurs in deep river valleys due to overestimated elevations, in coastal areas due probably to enhanced sea breeze circulation, and over large lakes due to the interpolation of water temperatures. Urban areas in concave topography forms have a warm summer bias due to the strong heat islands, not reflected in the observations. WRF-NOAH generates appropriate fine-scale features in the monthly temperature field over regions of complex topography, but over spatially homogeneous areas even small biases can lead to significant deteriorations relative to the driving reanalysis. As the added value of global climate model (GCM)-driven simulations cannot be smaller than this perfect-boundary estimate, this work demonstrates in a rigorous manner the clear additional value of dynamical downscaling over global climate simulations. The evaluation methodology has a broad spectrum of applicability as it is distribution-free, robust to spatial dependence, and accounts for time series structure.

THE IMPORTANCE OF COASTAL ROOKERIES IN THE LIFE OF THE BAIKAL SEAL (PUSA SIBIRICA GMELIN 1788, PINNIPEDIA) 3. FUNCTIONING OF THE BAIKAL SEAL ROOKERIES ON TONKIY ISLAND, USHKANY ISLANDS, LAKE BAIKAL, BASED ON VIDEO OBSERVATIONS	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												Based on an analysis of the unique video material received during four seasons (2012, 2014, 2018 and 2019) on one of the main rookeries of the Baikal nerpa. Pusa sibirica, on the Tonkiy Island, Lake Baikal, original information was obtained concerning the functioning of this land in summer and autumn. The nerpa intensely uses the shore every year for 5-6 months from May to October, sometimes including early November. The ecological capacity of the land is estimated at about 300 individuals (one-time location of the nerpa on land). The numbers of animals in the rookery are increased from May to July, but then gradually fall, yet remaining large on certain days, as nerpa arrive to land in groups. Probably for the same reason (group migration), there is no clear daily dynamics of the operation of the lay areas. Presently, staying on -shore is vital to a large part of the population, as each season thousands individuals of both sexes of different ages seem to pass through the lay areas. The main purpose of the rookeries, along with relaxation, is the need to complete shedding, since up to October, 60-40% animals on the rookeries are shedding. This is due to climate change in the region, in particular, the altered ice regime preventing the animals from completing their shedding on floating ice. Numerous animals in haulout show pathologies (scars, ulcers etc., as well as "fresh" wounds), mostly on the skin and hair cover. The main factor of animal anxiety is human interference, due to which nerpa leave the land almost every day.

At present, detailed analyses of these rhythms of rock salt are still limited, which directly affects the achievement of comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the developmental laws pertaining to this kind of saline lake. Therefore, we selected the typical rhythmic 'bamboo-like' rock salts of the Shizhai Depression in Jiangsu Province as the research subject. Through careful observation of rock salts in hand samples and detailed petrographic and mineralogical analyses, we analyzed the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions, homogenization temperatures and chemical compositions of individual fluid inclusions in halite crystals. Early-stage rhythmic deposition was a product of continental saline lake evolution in winter or spring, late-stage rhythmic deposition being the product of evolution in the summer. The seasonal evolution of the halite sequences was determined and two brine enrichment events were identified. In addition, the quiet saline lake environment with concentrated brine represented by rock salt was more likely to precipitate potassium. This study provides a new reference for the evolution of both Paleogene climate and saline lakes in eastern China.

The concentrations of ADS-P are seasonally variable, ranging from 0.2 mg Pg-1 DW in the winter to more than 2 mg Pg-1 DW in the summer. The variations can be observed as deep as 10 cm into the sediment but are most pronounced in the upper few centimeters. During the summer, lake and pore water pH levels are very high, and photosynthetic activity causes elevation to pH 10-11 in the lake. Laboratory experiments demonstrated a strong association between ADS-P and high pore water pH. It is likely that Lake S.vphi.bygaard represents an extreme example of pH control on sediment/water phosphorus equilibria in which high concentrations of internal ADS-P contribute significantly to the total P load of the Lake.

J	Chen, YL; Zhao, YP; Feng, JQ; Wang, F				Chen Yongli; Zhao Yongping; Feng Junqiao; Wang Fan			ENSO cycle and climate anomaly in China	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												The inter-annual variability of the tropical Pacific Subsurface Ocean Temperature Anomaly (SOTA) and the associated anomalous atmospheric circulation over the Asian North Pacific during the El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were investigated using National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) atmospheric reanalysis data and simple ocean data simulation (SODA). The relationship between the ENSO and the climate of China was revealed. The main results indicated the following: 1) there are two ENSO modes acting on the subsurface tropical Pacific. The first mode is related to the mature phase of ENSO, which mainly appears during winter. The second mode is associated with a transition stage of the ENSO developing or decaying, which mainly occurs during summer; 2) during the mature phase of El Nio, the meridionality of the atmosphere in the mid-high latitude increases, the Aleutian low and high pressure ridge over Lake Baikal strengthens, northerly winds prevail in northern China, and precipitation in northern China decreases significantly. The ridge of the Ural High strengthens during the decaying phase of El Nio, as atmospheric circulation is sustained during winter, and the northerly wind anomaly appears in northern China during summer. Due to the ascending branch of the Walker circulation over the western Pacific, the western Pacific Subtropical High becomes weaker, and south-southeasterly winds prevail over southern China. As a result, less rainfall occurs over northern China and more rainfall over the Changjiang River basin and the southwestern and eastern region of Inner Mongolia. The flood disaster that occurred south of Changjiang River can be attributed to this. The La Nia event causes an opposite, but weaker effect; 3) the ENSO cycle can influence climate anomalies within China via zonal and meridional heat transport. This is known as the "atmospheric-bridge", where the energy anomaly within the tropical Pacific transfers to the mid-high latitude in the northern Pacific through Hadley cells and Rossby waves, and to the western Pacific-eastern Indian Ocean through Walker circulation. This research also discusses the special air-sea boundary processes during the ENSO events in the tropical Pacific, and indicates that the influence of the subsurface water of the tropical Pacific on the atmospheric circulation may be realized through the sea surface temperature anomalies of the mixed water, which contact the atmosphere and transfer the anomalous heat and moisture to the atmosphere directly. Moreover, the reason for the heavy flood within the Changjiang River during the summer of 1998 is reviewed in this paper.

David			Metazoan Zooplankton	LAKE KINNERET: ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT	Aquatic Ecology Series											The Lake Kinneret metazoan zooplankton has been monitored since 1969 and currently includes the enumeration of 31 species of cyclopoids, cladocerans, and rotifers in samples collected fortnightly at five stations from around the lake. The zooplankton community has exhibited notable interannual and long-term variation since the start of the monitoring program that have included a decline in community size from the 1970s and 1980s to an extended period of low abundance and biomass in the 1990s followed by an increase during the first decade of the millennium. Along with the increase in abundances since the late 1990s, there has been an increase in interannual variation, which may be related to the unstable phytoplankton population and/ or to the large changes in lake level. The introduction of an additional sampling protocol since 2003 has highlighted the highly vertically aggregated nature of some of the rotifer species often found in very high densities near the thermocline. Seasonally, the lowest densities are found during the summer and the highest during the winter-spring. There is no indication of vertical migration by zooplankton in the lake. The zooplankton are patchily distributed and repeated sampling indicates that abundance estimates collected over a period of a year could vary by a factor 2-3 just due to fine-scale patchiness. Zooplankton in the lake play an important role as key nutrient recyclers with microzooplankton accounting for >85 % of the daily mineralization of P and N in the lake.

Sinninghe			Seasonal variation in the stable carbon isotopic composition of algal lipids in a shallow anoxic fjord:: Evaluation of the effect of recycling of respired CO2 on the δ13C of organic matter	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The sedimentary records of the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event display an up to 6 permil negative delta C-13 excursion in both carbonate and organic matter. One hypothesis to explain this excursion is increased recycling of respired CO2, formed by mineralization of organic matter and temporarily trapped below the chemocline of the shallow, stratified shelf seas of Europe ("the Kuspert hypothesis"). We attempted to evaluate the effect of recycling of CO2 on the C-13-contents of organic matter by studying a shallow marine fjord (Kyllaren, Norway) with persistent stratification and anoxic bottom waters. During a two-year field study the water column of the fjord was sampled for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and particulate organic matter (POM). Earlier studies indicated that delta C-13(DIC) in bottom waters is indeed substantially depleted (delta C-13 up to -20 parts per thousand) and that this isotopically depleted DIC is advected to surface waters at times of mixing. However, delta C-13 of particulate organic carbon (POC) did not reveal isotopic depletion of POC at times of advection of respired CO2 as predicted in Kuspert's scenario, perhaps due to the isotopic heterogeneity of POM. Therefore, in this study we used the delta C-13 of biomarker lipids for specific photoautotrophic organisms in the surface water (above the chemocline) to further evaluate the effect of recycling of respired CO2 on the C-13-contents of organic matter. The concentrations of specific sterols and long-chain alkenones revealed a seasonal succession of dominant algal classes: diatoms bloomed in the spring, haptophytes proliferated in late summer and dinoflagellates thrived in fall. The change of sources of POM, and the taxon-specific differences in the carbon isotopic fractionation (epsilon(p)) may thus deteriorate the correlation between the delta C-13-CO2 and that of POC as we would expect if recycling of respired CO2 has an impact on the C-13-contents of organic matter. Similar to the epsilon(p) of POC, a large variation in the epsilon(p) of the sterols and alkenones was observed. Moreover, a strong co-variance existed between the epsilon(p) of POC and that of the individual biolipids, with high epsilon(p) in summer (up to 22 parts per thousand) and very low epsilon(p) (3 to 15 parts per thousand) in the fall. Most likely, a common environmental factor, such as an increased nutrient supply, caused the decrease in epsilon(p). Water column mixing by storms, the same mechanism that likely increased the C-13-depleted DIC in the oxygenated surface water of Kyllaren fjord in the fall, also explains the increase of nutrients. As a consequence, the short term effect of recycling of respired CO2 on the delta C-13 of phytoplankton lipids and total organic carbon is negligible in this anoxic marine system. This shows that, even by using compound-specific isotopes, it is difficult to reconstruct the impact of recycling of respired CO2 on the C-13-contents of organic matter.

J	Bubb, DH; Lucas, MC; Thom, TJ				Bubb, DH; Lucas, MC; Thom, TJ			Winter movements and activity of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus in an upland river, determined by radio telemetry	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Radio-telemetry was used to study the late autumn and winter movements of twenty adult signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus (32.9-63.8 mm carapace length) an introduced exotic crayfish species, in the upland River Wharfe, northern England. The distances moved during the study varied greatly between individuals (0-328 m). Movements were generally sporadic; crayfish would remain in one position for several weeks and make occasional movements to new locations. Total distances travelled, linear range and ranging area did not differ significantly between males and females. The distance travelled in upstream and downstream directions did not differ significantly and there was no correlation between distance travelled and crayfish size. Several high flow events occurred during the study, but these did not cause any mortality or apparent displacement of crayfish downstream, suggesting that this is not a significant factor in downstream dispersal or mortality of adults of this invasive crayfish species in winter. A marked reduction in large-scale movements occurred in mid-December which coincided with a decline in water temperature. There was a less distinct pattern in local activity which was strongly correlated with water temperature and varied before and after mid-December.																			0018-8158					SEP	2002	483	1-3					111	119		10.1023/A:1021363109155	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021363109155													WOS:000179639600013
J	Wojtal-Frankiewicz, A				Wojtal-Frankiewicz, Adrianna			The effects of global warming on Daphnia spp. population dynamics: a review	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Various species of Daphnia usually play a key role in the food web of temperate freshwater systems. There is much evidence to show that climate change may influence Daphnia population dynamics, consequently altering both predator-prey interactions and the efficiency of algal biomass control in these ecosystems. This review will analyse and discuss the current knowledge on Daphnia responses to climate warming based on an analysis of selected papers. The presented results indicate that warming may have important direct and indirect effects on Daphnia biology and ecology via its influence on their life-history processes (metabolism, growth, reproduction) and the properties of their habitats. The plasticity of daphnids in terms of adaptive responses is generally high and includes phenotypic adaptations and changes in genotypes, although it also depends upon the strength of selection and the available genetic variation. The seasonal timing and magnitude of temperature increases are important for seasonal biomass fluctuations of Daphnia and similarly influence the potential synchrony of daphnids and phytoplankton succession (the timing hypothesis). In light of the most recent studies on this topic, even a minor warming during short but critical seasonal periods can cause factors that disturb Daphnia population dynamics to coincide, which may destabilize lake food webs by decoupling trophic interactions. Both winter and spring are important critical periods for determining future seasonal fluxes of Daphnia spp. and, consequently, the time of the clear-water phase and the occurrence and duration of Daphnia midsummer decline. Winter conditions may also affect the impact of fish predation on daphnids during summer months. However, the effects of global warming on Daphnia population dynamics and on ecosystem functioning are often difficult to predict due to their complexity and the presence of both antagonistic and synergistic drivers. Thus, the diverse responses of daphnids to climate anomalies depend on both biotic (predator abundance and seasonal phytoplankton succession) and abiotic factors (e.g. hydrodynamics, intensity and duration of thermal stratification, trophic state or geomorphology) of lakes, which are directly influenced by weather changes. The analysis and quantification of such complex interactions require the involvement of different kinds of specialists and the development of accurate research approaches, such as molecular genetic methods or mathematical modelling.

J	Taylor, TN; Cross, BK; Moore, BC				Taylor, Timothy N.; Cross, Benjamin K.; Moore, Barry C.			Modeling Brook Trout Carrying Capacity in Owhi Lake, Washington, Using Bioenergetics	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The management of fish populations often requires an understanding of how density-dependent effects influence population dynamics. In systems where natural populations are supplemented with stocking, the question of "how much food is available" becomes increasingly important. One typical approach for assessing density-dependent interactions is to identify disparities between fish consumption rates and food availability. The objective of our study was to determine whether seasonal lake prey production could support Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis consumption demand in Owhi Lake, Washington, at observed abundances. Brook Trout were collected seasonally from 2015 to 2017 to obtain information on length, weight, age, diet, growth, and mortality. Population abundance was estimated in summer by using hydroacoustic surveys. Littoral invertebrates and pelagic zooplankton were collected concurrently with fish to enumerate biomass and production. Bioenergetics modeling was used to estimate prey consumption by Brook Trout. In conjunction with supply-demand comparisons, we used growth efficiencies and maximum consumption rates to further identify potential seasonal and annual food limitations. Our results suggest that prey production could support Brook Trout consumption demand for all years, but littoral invertebrate consumption was close to or exceeded prey production in summer and fall 2017. Growth efficiency was lowest and maximum consumption rates were highest in summer 2017 relative to all other seasons and years. In addition to observed diet switching from littoral invertebrates to zooplankton in summer 2016 and 2017, we concluded that lower growth efficiencies, lower annual survival rates, and increased consumption rates were influenced by littoral invertebrate production. The Owhi Lake Brook Trout stocking program may require adaptive management (i.e., annual evaluations) to balance natural recruitment.

J	Gross, ML; Kapuscinski, AR				Gross, ML; Kapuscinski, AR			Reproductive success of smallmouth bass estimated and evaluated from family-specific DNA fingerprints	ECOLOGY												This paper presents the results of the first attempt to estimate and identify factors influencing individual reproductive success in a fish species, under natural conditions, after the progeny have dispersed from their site of origin. Using family-specific DNA fingerprints, the reproductive success of male smallmouth bass in Lake Opeongo, Ontario was estimated and evaluated at the point when their offspring were fall young-of-the-year (YOY). For the 1992 spring spawning season, we generated family-specific fingerprints using DNA of fry captured from 116 nests in Jones Bay. In the fall of the same year, 283 YOY were captured by electrofishing along the shoreline of the study area. Using DNA obtained from fin tissue, a fingerprint was generated for each fall YOY and compared to the family fingerprints to determine the family of origin. Males were considered successful if at least one of their offspring survived to the fall YOY stage. Although 27.7% of all males who acquired eggs (N = 57) had at least one offspring Surviving to the fall YOY stage, only 5.4% of all spawning males (N = 11) produced 54.7% of the total number of fall YOY captured. If recruitment frequently depends on the success of such a small number of males, then population abundance will be extremely vulnerable to adverse natural and anthropogenic impacts. Because natural resource managers cannot differentiate these few successful males a priori, they cannot differentially protect them from potentially adverse human activities? such as opening the fishing season on a preset date that may fall before the end of brood-guarding in a given year. The evaluation of variables that might influence differences in male reproductive success included male length and age, spawning date, number of eggs and fry within a nest, nest depth, and dominant substrate type both within and surrounding the nest. Logistic regression analysis indicated that none of these variables were significant predictors of male reproductive success (P > 0.05). Additionally, linear regression analysis suggested the lack of a relationship between the number of fall YOY produced per male and these variables. However, a goodness-of-fit test to the Poisson distribution indicated that the number of YOY produced per male does not occur at random (P < 0.001), suggesting that reproductive success was influenced by factors not measured in this study.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JUL	1997	78	5					1424	1430																WOS:A1997XK92900014

After the establishment of the National Park Neusiedler See-Seewinkel in 1993, eel stocking was prohibited and the population, together with the specific parasites of eels, was predicted to decline to extinction within 10 years. This investigation was undertaken to document the decline and extinction of the Anguillicola crassus population in eels. From 1994 to 2001, 720 eels were collected from two sites in the lake. Prevalence and abundance of A. crassus were lower in spring than in summer and autumn and larger eels harboured more parasites than smaller ones. Neither year of study nor sampling site were correlated with parasite infection levels. No significant trend in the population parameters of A. crassus was detected over the 8 years of the survey. This suggested that there had been no significant decline in the eel population. This suggestion was confirmed by investigations of the fishery, which also found evidence of regular illegal stocking. The stability of the A. crassus population over the past decade seems to reflect the lack of change in eel population density. No mass mortalities of eels occurred over the period despite the many similarities between Neusiedler See and Lake Balaton in Hungary. Differences in eel size, eel diet and the lack of large-scale insecticide use are discussed as possible explanations for the absence of eel mass mortalities in Neusiedler See.					; Reckendorfer, Walter/F-5939-2013	Reckendorfer, Walter/0000-0001-5855-2885; 													0022-149X					JUN	2005	79	2					159	167		10.1079/JOH2005281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/JOH2005281								15946398					WOS:000229679500010

Macroinvertebrates play a crucial role in food webs and contribute about 42% of whole-lake secondary productivity. Therefore, their status is vital for maintaining good ecological functions. In this study, we selected Nanwan Reservoir, a eutrophic thermally stratified reservoir in China, to evaluate the community of macroinvertebrates in different seasons and explore the relationships between macroinvertebrate assemblages and different planktonic groups, including phytoplankton, protozoans, rotifers, and planktonic crustaceans. Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta dominated the phytoplankton assemblages, and their proportions varied with seasons. The bad community of macroinvertebrates in summer, autumn, and winter could be attributed to the excessive growth of Cyanophyta or other phytoplankton. Based on the results of partial least squares regression, an algorithm used for prediction, we determined that the excessive growth of algae, crustaceans, protozoans, and Cyanophyta was detrimental to the development of macroinvertebrates, and was indicative of high nutrient loads in the reservoir. However, the growth of Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta, and Euglenophyta was advantageous to macroinvertebrate assemblages and indicated a better ecological condition of the reservoir. The results of partial least squares structural equation modeling demonstrated close associations between phytoplankton and both zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, indicating their interdependence in this reservoir system. Our study results imply that the status of macroinvertebrates can be predicted by the abundance of some planktonic assemblages, and cost savings from selecting one of the planktonic groups to monitor ecological conditions could be accomplished in future studies.

A Whole Sample Toxicity Assessment to Evaluate the Sub-Lethal Toxicity of Water and Sediment Elutriates from a Lake Exposed to Diffuse Pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												The impact of diffuse pollution in aquatic systems is of great concern due to the difficult to measure and regulate it. As part of an ecological risk assessment (ERA), this study aims to use a whole sample toxicity assessment to evaluate the toxicity of water and sediment from Lake Vela, a lake that has been exposed to diffuse pollution. In this way, standard (algae: Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; cladoceran: Daphnia magna) and local species (algae: Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; cladoceran: Daphnia longispina) were exposed to surface water, and sediment elutriates were collected seasonally from two sites at Lake Vela: one near the east bank (ES), surrounded by agricultural lands; and the other near the west bank (WS), surrounded by a forest. The results confirmed the seasonal contamination of both environmental compartments by pesticides, including organochlorine pesticides, and the presence of high concentrations of nutrients. Although both sites were contaminated, higher levels of pesticides and nutrients were detected in ES, particularly in the sediments. Bioassays showed that water samples (100% concentration) collected in summer and autumn significantly affected the growth rate of P. subcapitata, which could be attributed to the presence of pesticides. Likewise, they revealed an apparent toxicity of elutriates for P subcapitata and for both daphnids, in summer and autumn. In fact, although pesticides were not detected in elutriates, high levels of un-ionized ammonia were recorded, which is considered highly toxic to aquatic life. By comparing the several species, P. subcapitata was revealed to be the most sensitive one, followed by the daphnids, and then by A. flos-aquae. Results obtained in this study underlined the importance of whole samples toxicity assessment for characterizing the ecological effects of complex mixtures from diffuse inputs, in the ERA processes.

On Sept. 4 oxygen concentration a few cm. above bottom was as low as 0.70 ppm in some areas. This depletion apparently resulted in destruction of a large portion of Hexagenia population. Dredge samples taken on Sept. 5, from same area where low oxygen concentrations were found yielded 465 nymphs per sq. m., but all were dead. In 61 bottom collections between Canadian Shore and Catawba Is. in autumn 1953, avg. of living nymphs per sq. m. was 44.3. This was much lower than avgs. found in previous yrs. Stomach contents of silver chub showed a great reduction in use of Hexagenia nymphs in Sept. and Nov., 1953, as contrasted with same period in 1952. Empty burrows and unusual quantity of sclerotized Hexagenia remains were additional indicators of a decimated population.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1955	36	2					239	244		10.2307/1933229	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1933229													WOS:A1955WR61700008

It is therefore important to understand the modern isotope hydrology of these lakes. Here we discuss the significance of variations in water isotope composition of a series of lakes located in north-west Swedish Lapland. Climate in this region is forced by changes in the North Atlantic which renders it an interesting area for climate reconstructions. We compare delta O-18(lake) and delta H-2(lake) collected between 2001 and 2006 and show that lakes in this sub-Arctic region are currently mainly recharged by shallow groundwater and precipitation which undergoes little subsequent evaporation, and that the delta O-18 and delta H-2 composition of input to the majority of the lakes varies on a seasonal basis between winter precipitation (spring thaw) and summer precipitation. Seasonal variations in the isotopic composition of the lake waters are larger in lakes with short residence times (<6 months), which react faster to seasonal changes in the precipitation, compared to lakes with longer residence times (>6 months), which retain an isotopic signal closer to that of annual mean precipitation. Lake waters also show a range of isotope values between sites due to catchment elevation and timing of snowmelt. The lake water data collected in this study was supported by isotope data from lake waters, streams and ground waters from 1995 to 2000 reported in other studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These discharge processes depend on seasonal reactions to meteorological conditions, generating variable river discharge magnitudes, including floods. Four types of meteorologically driven floods in glacier-covered catchments were distinguished, depending on the seasonal variations in the dominant water supply source and the type of storage. These four types of floods were induced by: 1 - spring/summer snow-melt; 2 - mid-summer ice and snow-melt; 3 - rainfall events, and 4 - fohn phenomena. Additionally, sudden water drainage from ice-dammed lakes of various origins may generate amounts of discharge surpassing total annual discharge. Flooding events from the High Arctic glacier-covered catchments in the area between Billefjorden and Wijdefjorden, in the central part of Spitsbergen (Svalbard), were characterised. Floods occurred more than once per ten days during the ablation season. These floods are considered the main agents of proglacial relief remodelling, sediment transport and deposition.					; Rachlewicz, Grzegorz/AAJ-1907-2020	Rachlewicz, Grzegorz/0000-0003-1826-2079; 													0029-1951	1502-5292					2009	63	2					115	122	PII 912441758	10.1080/00291950902907835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00291950902907835													WOS:000267098100004

Determination of Al, Cr, Cu, and Zn in water was carried out by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (Shimadzu, AA 610s) and in sediment by flame atomic absorption spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, AA3030). Results showed that the heavy metal concentrations in the water samples decreased in the sequence of Zn > Al > Cu > Cr, while in sediment samples were Cr > Zn > Cu > Al. Data analysis indicated that with the exception of Al, there was a Pearson's correlation coefficient between pH and Cu, Zn, and Cr at alpha = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.001 in sediment (in winter), respectively. There were also significant differences between heavy metals of Cr, Cu, and Zn during the two seasons (p < 0.001) in the water and sediment.

The amplitude of daily vertical movements was much greater between Oct. and March than between Apr, and Sept., and it is concluded that thermal or chemical stratification may have inhibitory effects on zooplankters. In addition to daily vertical movements, the general population of Diaptomus birgei showed a slow seasonal drift upward into the surface waters beginning in the autumn and downward beginning in the spring.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1949	30	1					93	100		10.2307/1932280	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932280													WOS:A1949XW59700008

In freshwater lakes, the clade is represented by tribe LD12 which is phylogenetically distinct from the marine SAR11. We studied the ecology of LD12 in a temperate dimictic lake (Lake Erken, Sweden), by analyzing its seasonal dynamics with quantitative PCR, CARD-FISH and 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Results showed that LD12 can be as numerous in freshwater bacterioplankton as their marine SAR11 siblings. They exhibited strong seasonality and made up from 1.8 to 40% of the total bacterial 16S rRNA pool (mean 14%) with pronounced peaks in summer and late fall. Except in spring, LD12 was the dominant Alphaproteobacteria, contributing on average 72% of the 16S rRNA within this class. The LD12 population was dominated by a single persistent ribotype, suggesting low local divergence, at least at the phylogenetic resolution accessed with rRNA genes. The relative abundance of LD12 was positively correlated to nutrient concentrations (phosphate, ammonia, nitrate, and silica) and water transparency whereas the relative abundance was lower during periods characterized by high phytoplankton biomass. Based on these observations we propose that LD12 are poor competitors during periods of high phytoplankton productivity and associated release of labile organic compounds, but thrive when availability of inorganic nutrients is high. Similar to the marine SAR11 sibling group, local LD12 populations appear to respond in contrasting ways to nutrient availability in different lakes, pointing to either ecological divergence within the tribe or variations in the interplay between environmental driver variables.

J	Blomqvist, P				Blomqvist, P			Early summer phytoplankton responses to experimental manipulations of grazing and nutrients in unlimed and limed Lake Njupfatet, central Sweden	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Phytoplankton biomass and succession during the spring-early summer period were studied in oligotrophic, moderately acidic, Lake Njupfatet during two consecutive years, one before and one after whole-lake calcite treatment. Liming had little effect on the early summer phytoplankton community and three groups, Chrysophyceae, Dinophyceae and Chlorococcales, completely dominated before as well as after liming. Enclosure experiments were carried out to assess the role of nutrients and zooplankton in regulating the early summer community of phytoplankton in the unlimed and limed lake, respectively. Despite differences in starting point regarding phytoplankton development, the communities and most of their components responded in the same way in both experiments. Community biomass showed a positive response to nutrient additions in combination with a negative response to grazing. Edible organisms such as small and medium-sized chrysophytes and dinoflagellates, responded weakly to the nutrient additions but showed a negative response to grazing. Grazing-resistant forms, small coccoid green algae and large species in general, showed a positive response to nutrients but were indifferent to, or favoured by, grazing. The results are discussed against the background of general theories about phytoplankton succession. It is concluded that neither the acidic nor the limed system were disturbed with respect to regulation of the early summer phytoplankton community.																			0003-9136					SEP	1997	140	3					321	346																WOS:A1997YG77000003

We speculated that Microcystis genotype succession could play an important role in adaptation to environmental changes and long-term maintenance of the high Microcystis biomass. In this study, we investigated Microcystis genotype succession pattern and the related environmental variables in Lake Taihu during cyanobacterial blooms. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain reaction -amplified the genus-specific cpcBA and mcyJ gene fragments was used to monitor the variations of Microcystis genotype and potential microcystin (MC)-producing Microcystis genotype compositions during blooms biweekly in three sites (Meiliang Bay, lake center, and Gonghu Bay) and CANOCO 4.5 for Windows were used for the multivariate statistical analysis of their relationships to environmental variables. DGGE patterns indicated that the number of dominant cpcBA genotype per sample increased from spring to autumn. Principal component analysis ordination plots of DGGE profiles showed clear temporal distribution pattern, but not spatial distribution pattern based on both cpcBA and mcyJ genotype compositions. These results indicated there were relatively gradual successions of Microcystis cpcBA and mcyJ genotype compositions in each site, and no distinct spatial difference among the three sites. Redundancy analyses of the gel patterns showed that, in all the three sites, three environmental factors (nitrate, pH, and chemical oxygen demand) were correlated significantly to successions of both cpcBA and mcyJ genotypes except for mcyJ genotype in the lake center. Spearman's correlations indicated that the three environmental variables were also strongly correlated with chl a and MC concentrations. These results suggested that the environmental factors affecting succession of Microcystis community composition might also influence the growth of Microcystis and MC production.					luo, lan/JTT-0853-2023														0095-3628	1432-184X				NOV	2012	64	4					986	999		10.1007/s00248-012-0083-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-012-0083-1								22760733					WOS:000310127900013

In the river Moselle in midsummer 1994 a strong oxygen decline between Hauconcourt and Palzem was correlated with a decrease of algal biomass. Further oxygen depletion in later summer in both rivers was a result of oxygen-consuming processes, bacterial carbon oxidation and nitrification, in times of low phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis. As computed by our model, algal biomass is reduced in summer and autumn by highly efficient grazing of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. From July until September 1994 in the upper part of the river Moselle, a mean reduction of chlorophyll a of about 50% was computed. A dynamic approach is used to compute the seasonal increase of D. polymorpha population density and filtering capacity as well. The longitudinal decrease of mussel population density in the Moselle towards the river mouth is a consequence of the decreasing food concentration mainly due to the filtering activity of D. polymorpha in upstream reaches.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	410						167	176		10.1023/A:1003858713999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003858713999													WOS:000084826000019

In summer, populations near the lake surface are less sensitive to light inhibition and can maximize the photosynthetic utilization of light energy. Pigment to wet weight ratios and the photosynthetic light responses show similar seasonal and vertical patterns suggesting that pigment concentration changes are a major adaptational mechanism.

Observations are already showing a decrease in spring snow cover duration at high latitudes, but the impact of changing winter season temperature and precipitation on variables such as snow water equivalent (SWE) is less clear. A multi-year project was initiated in 2004 with the objective to quantify tundra snow cover properties over multiple years at a scale appropriate for comparison with satellite passive microwave remote sensing data and regional climate and hydrological models. Data collected over seven late winter field campaigns (2004 to 2010) show the patterns of snow depth and SWE are strongly influenced by terrain characteristics. Despite the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover, several inter-annual consistencies were identified. A regional average density of 0.293 g/cm3 was derived and shown to have little difference with individual site densities when deriving SWE from snow depth measurements. The inter-annual patterns of SWE show that despite variability in meteorological forcing, there were many consistent ratios between the SWE on flat tundra and the SWE on lakes, plateaus, and slopes. A summary of representative inter-annual snow stratigraphy from different terrain categories is also presented. (c) 2013 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Hydrological Processes.

J	Mohammed, Y; Yimam, A				Mohammed, Yimer; Yimam, Asnake			Analysis of meteorological droughts in the Lake's Region of Ethiopian Rift Valley using reconnaissance drought index (RDI)	GEOENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS												This study investigated the intensity, trend and spatio-temporal variability of meteorological drought in the Lakes' Region of Ethiopian Rift Valley using monthly rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature records for the period 1986-2019. Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) was employed to generate the intensity of drought at 3 and 12-months timescale. Mann-Kendall trend test was used to determine the trend of the changes in the RDI time series. The spatial extent of droughts has been interpolated by inverse distance weighted (IDW) method using the spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS. Results indicated the occurrence of different intensity and trend signals across seasons and over space in the study area. A total of 33 extreme drought months were observed in all stations during summer with varying intensity (- 2.01 at Halaba to - 3.52 at Wolaita) and 168 extreme drought months at annual timescale ranging from - 2.10 at Hawassa to - 4.51 at Wolaita. The intensity of drought events observed in Wolaita in 1986 at all timescales (RDI value of - 3.19, - 3.52 and - 4.51 for spring, summer and annual respectively) were very extraordinary and devastating. Drought magnitude showed increasing signal at 6 out of 10 stations, although statistically significant at only two stations (Arsi Negelle at all timescale and Butajira at spring and annual timescale). However, the spatial patterns of drought events didn't exhibit clear pattern rather more localized distribution and variability. The frequency of drought incidence became intense in the study area from 2008 onwards at all timescales compared to the 1990s and 2000s.The increasing tendency of drought in recent years might be the manifestation of borderless global warming. The empirical evidences showed that drought events and their negative effects are highly localized in the study area and provide useful information for local-scale planning for drought management and response.																				2197-8670				MAY 31	2021	8	1							13	10.1186/s40677-021-00183-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40677-021-00183-1													WOS:000656456400001

After ice-off, the oxycline was mixed downward from 3 to 6 m depth, resulting in addition of 5 mg m(-2) P-SRP, 857 mg m(-2) N-NH4+, and 400 mg m(-2) N-NO3- to the epilimnion, but trapping 299 mg m(-2) P-SRP, 7877 mg m-(2) N-NH4+ and 36 mg m-2 N-NO3 in the bottom waters. Nutrients supplied by snow melt runoff (138 mg m(-2) P-SRP, 430 mg m(-2) N-NH4+, 596 mg m(-2) N-NO3-) were an order of magnitude greater than rain event loads (0.13 mg m(-2) P-SRP, 0.17 mg m(-2) N-NH4+, and 1.05 mg m(-2) N-NO3-) during the transition time from ice cover to open water. Reduced spring mixing did not have a large impact on N:P molar ratios, because external N:P ratios were low (7.5) compensating for reduced supply of P from the bottom waters. Bacterial production was greater in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion, and mesocosm experiments showed that bacteria were P limited in the epilimnion but not in the hypolimnion. Total algal and zooplankton densities increased after ice-out, while Daphnia and Bosmina densities decreased. Increases in zooplankton grazing rates after ice-off were most dramatic in small-bodied zooplankton. Sediment core analysis showed that Asterionella relative abundance continues to increase, suggesting that the lake has become more brackish and oligotrophic. Our findings suggest that TSL has undergone a transition from dimictic to meromictic conditions, and that continued salt inputs have altered the structure and function of this ecosystem.

A heavy bloom of Microcystis. aeruginosa in Baoyang River was recorded in 2004 and microcystin-RR (MCRR), the most popular cyanobacterial hepatotoxin microcystins in China, could be detected in the river in the next several years in the filtered waters. To determine the environmental variable factors associated with concentrations of MCRR, samples taken from the beginning of April 2008 to the end of March 2009, were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. MCRR, the main microcystins found in the filtered water samples from spring to winter, ranged from undetectable to 4.37 mu g/L. The highest concentrations of MCRR were found in the late summer in October 2008, and the concentrations of MCRR at the bottom waters were higher than that at the aquatic surfaces. Significant positive relationships (p<0.01) were observed between MCRR and NO3-N; but significant negative relationships (p<0.01) were observed between MCRR and pH, COD, NO2-N and TN. This research indicated NO3-N would be very important for the biosynthesis of MCRR. The relationships between MCRR concentrations and environmental factors were complicated and further researches should be focused on the prediction methods of microcystins by the nonlinear models for their potential health risks.					zhang, hangjun/AAI-6125-2020; hu, chuanmin/J-5021-2012	zhang, hangjun/0000-0002-3281-6093													2151-7614		978-1-4244-4713-8				2010																								WOS:000397260208024

Holocene flood frequency across the Central Alps - solar forcing and evidence for variations in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The frequency of large-scale heavy precipitation events in the European Alps is expected to undergo substantial changes with current climate change. Hence, knowledge about the past natural variability of floods caused by heavy precipitation constitutes important input for climate projections. We present a comprehensive Holocene (10,000 years) reconstruction of the flood frequency in the Central European Alps combining 15 lacustrine sediment records. These records provide an extensive catalog of flood deposits, which were generated by flood-induced underflows delivering terrestrial material to the lake floors. The multi-archive approach allows suppressing local weather patterns, such as thunderstorms, from the obtained climate signal. We reconstructed mainly late spring to fall events since ice cover and precipitation in form of snow in winter at high-altitude study sites do inhibit the generation of flood layers. We found that flood frequency was higher during cool periods, coinciding with lows in solar activity. In addition, flood occurrence shows periodicities that are also observed in reconstructions of solar activity from C-14 and Be-10 records (2500-3000, 900-1200, as well as of about 710, 500, 350, 208 (Suess cycle), 150, 104 and 87 (Gleissberg cycle) years). As atmospheric mechanism, we propose an expansion/shrinking of the Hadley cell with increasing/decreasing air temperature, causing dry/wet conditions in Central Europe during phases of high/low solar activity. Furthermore, differences between the flood patterns from the Northern Alps and the Southern Alps indicate changes in North Atlantic circulation. Enhanced flood occurrence in the South compared to the North suggests a pronounced southward position of the Westerlies and/or blocking over the northern North Atlantic, hence resembling a negative NAO state (most distinct from 4.2 to 2.4 kyr BP and during the Little Ice Age). South-Alpine flood activity therefore provides a qualitative record of variations in a paleo-NAO pattern during the Holocene. Additionally, increased South Alpine flood activity contrasts to low precipitation in tropical Central America (Cariaco Basin) on the Holocene and centennial time scale. This observation is consistent with a Holocene southward migration of the Atlantic circulation system, and hence of the ITCZ, driven by decreasing summer insolation in the Northern hemisphere, as well as with shorter-term fluctuations probably driven by solar activity.

Scrobicularia plana (DA COSTA, 1778) occurred at annual mean densities (biomasses) of 299 +/- 65 to 400 +/- 100 individuals/m (22.54 +/- 3.00 to 34.27 +/- 3.96 g ash-free dry mass (AFDM)/m(2)) depending on the study area. The annual mean density of Abra tenuis (MONTAGU, 1803) amounted to 640 +/- 74 individuals/m(2) during the whole study period, in contrast the biomass rose from 2.87 g AFDM/m(2) in July to 10.29 g AFDM/m(2) in April. Both species were largely dominated by age class I. Although not very successful, recruitment presented a two-period pattern: the main period at the beginning of spring, and a secondary one in late summer/autumn. S. plana rarely exceeded 40 mm and lived for. only 2 years, while most individuals of A. tenuis lived for only 15-18 months growing to a length of 12 mm. The annual bivalve deposit-feeder production for the whole lagoon system (90 km(2)) was 8.24g AFDM/m(2) (5.26 g C/m(2), 0.65 g N/m(2)). The annual P/(B) over bar ratio was about 0.4 and therefore in the same order of magnitude as estimates from other brackish coastal waters.																			1434-2944	1522-2632					2005	90	4					376	391		10.1002/iroh.200410767	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.200410767													WOS:000231563100004

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												European frog-bit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L.), a free-floating, stoloniferous aquatic, is native to Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. It was discovered in Canada in 1932 in Ottawa, but earlier introduction is possible. By 1955 its North American distribution extended from Ottawa to Montreal. By 1980 it had extended southwest to Lake Ontario and northeast to Quebec City. Recently it has spread throughout much of the central and southwestern parts of southern Ontario, and further into northern New York and Vermont and eastern Michigan. The maximum rate of spread has been 15.6 km yr(-1). Reproduction by seeds is rarely reported but vegetative reproduction is very important in spread and colonization. In the fall, turions separate from the plant, sinking to the bottom where they overwinter. In the spring, these turions grow into small floating rosettes. Extremely rapid stoloniferous growth during the summer months results in the formation of large masses of interlocking plants that diminish native submerged aquatic plant communities by reducing available light. It is also of importance in limiting water flow in irrigation systems and restricting water traffic, thereby hindering recreational activity. Management has been largely mechanical. Hydrocharis morsus-ranae is a food plant for several water birds, rodents, fish and insects.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				OCT	2003	83	4					1001	1016		10.4141/P02-033	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/P02-033													WOS:000188252400047

Depth segregation or vertical migration is usually attributed to other Daphnia species such as D. hyalina or D. longispina. In a two-year study, we found that in a deep, dammed-valley reservoir (Rimov Reservoir, Czechia) the majority of the population of D. galeata lives in the warm epilimnetic waters during the summer months, but some specimens of this species could be always found in the deep strata as well. This hypolimnetic subpopulation stays in the cold hypolimnetic water and does not migrate. The abundance of hypolimnetic D. galeata does not exceed one specimen per litre and usually shows seasonal variation (minimal densities in early spring, maximal in late summer). Using allozyme electrophoresis, we found that the subpopulation from the deep hypolimnion was clearly genetically differentiated from the population in the epilimnion. We found significant differences in both allele and multilocus genotype frequencies; the F-ST values at most sampling dates exceeded 0.05. However, the spatial segregation between the epilimnetic and hypolimnetic subpopulations is not permanent. The reservoir is dimictic and hence, at least twice per year, all vertically segregated parts of the population are mixed together. Our results suggest that the deep hypolimnetic subpopulation is repeatedly re-established in spring by deepwater "colonists", at least some of which seem to be ecologically specialised for the hypolimnetic conditions, and dominate the hypolimnion by the end of the season. The genetic differentiation is likely the result of both the different depth preferences of various D. galeata clones and different selective pressures in the epilimnion and hypolimnion.

This long-term field study deepens the knowledge concerning the life cycle of Chironomus plumosus (Diptera), the main responsible for summer chironomid swarms that adversely affect human littoral activities, providing useful information for its management. About 108,000 macrobenthic specimens were collected, belonging to Oligochaeta (Naididae) (62%), Diptera (Chironomidae) (37%), and only 1.5% to other invertebrate taxa. Eighteen chironomid taxa were found. The trend of chironomid density was not affected by C. plumosus, which showed a maximum increase in September. This peak is justified by the presence of large swarms of C. plumosus in late August in which the populations of the central area of Lake Trasimeno consistently participate. The larval density of this species did not increase over the 17 years. A detailed analysis of the sampled larvae and adult biomass catches from 2017 to 2020 reveals that four annual swarmings occurred: in April, July, August, and September-October. The water temperature remains higher than 20 degrees C during the night hours from the end of May to mid-September, strengthening the hypothesis of the three midge swarming cycles in the summer period until early autumn.					; Pallottini, Matteo/AAE-2091-2019; La Porta, Gianandrea/F-3545-2014; Goretti, Enzo/G-2785-2014; Selvaggi, Roberta/AAD-1798-2020	GORETTI, Enzo/0000-0003-1543-3928; La Porta, Gianandrea/0000-0002-6465-5423; Pallottini, Matteo/0000-0002-0371-3239; 														2071-1050				JAN	2023	15	1							851	10.3390/su15010851	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15010851													WOS:000909105400001

Phenology of high-elevation pelagic bacteria: the roles of meteorologic variability, catchment inputs and thermal stratification in structuring communities	ISME JOURNAL												Many eukaryotic communities exhibit predictable seasonality in species composition, but such phenological patterns are not well-documented in bacterial communities. This study quantified seasonal variation in the community composition of bacterioplankton in a high-elevation lake in the Sierra Nevada of California over a 3-year period of 2004-2006. Bacterioplankton exhibited consistent phenological patterns, with distinct, interannually recurring community types characteristic of the spring snowmelt, ice-off and fall-overturn periods in the lake. Thermal stratification was associated with the emergence of specific communities each summer and increased community heterogeneity throughout the water column. Two key environmental variables modulated by regional meteorologic variation, lake residence time and thermal stability, predicted the timing of occurrence of community types each year with 75% accuracy, and each corresponded with different aspects of variation in community composition (orthogonal ordination axes). Seasonal variation in dissolved organic matter source was characterized fluorometrically in 2005 and was highly correlated with overall variation in bacterial community structure (r(Mantel) = 0.75, P<0.001) and with the relative contributions of specific phylotypes within the Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and beta-Proteobacteria. The seasonal dynamics of bacterial clades (tracked through coupling of randomized clone sequence libraries to restriction fragment length polymorphism fingerprints) matched previous results from alpine lakes and were variously related to solute inputs, thermal stability and temperature. Taken together, these results describe a phenology of high-elevation bacterioplankton communities linked to climate-driven physical and chemical lake characteristics already known to regulate eukaryotic plankton community structure.					; Nelson, Craig/H-3323-2019	Nelson, Craig/0000-0003-2525-3496; 													1751-7362	1751-7370				JAN	2009	3	1					13	30		10.1038/ismej.2008.81	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2008.81								18784755					WOS:000262297400003

Persistence of fecal contamination and pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 in snow and snowmelt	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Runoff from snowmelt can be a significant nonpoint source of fecal contamination into waters used for winter recreation, and in spring months leading up to the bathing season. However, little research has been conducted to understand bacterial persistence and potential accumulation in snow, or the fate of fecal contamination in snowmelt in advance of every bathing season in temperate climates. In this study, microcosms containing snow held at either - 10, 0 or 4 degrees C were inoculated with either a lab culture containing environmental strains of Escherichia coli and a strain of pathogenic E. coil 0157:H7, or raw sewage influent. Enumeration of E. coli via culturable and qPCR-methods was performed as well as qPCR enumeration of microbial source tracking (MST) markers for general and human-specific Bacteroidales in sewage-inoculated microcosms. Results showed that culturable E. coli and E. coil 0157:H7 concentrations decreased throughout the experiment at all temperatures, while E. coil concentrations and MST markers enumerated via qPCR tended to remain at stable concentrations throughout the duration of the experiment at temperatures of 10 or 0 degrees C. Concentrations of all targets, by both culturable and qPCR-enumeration decreased faster at 4 degrees C, except for general Bacteroidales. These results suggest that fecal contamination, and associated pathogens, can persist for months and may accumulate in snow. Further, fecal contaminants in snowmelt runoff may persist for weeks to months in recreational water settings, with potential implications for winter sports as well as the start of the spring bathing season at some beaches in temperate climates.

Stratigraphic relationships suggest that they are two distinct primary fall tephras. The geochemistries of these tephras from electron probe microanalysis were compared with those of known layers found in the area to test for potential correlations, using clustering analysis on geochemistry. In most cases, geochemical data from a tephra layer can be assigned to a single cluster, but in some cases the analyses are spread over several clusters. This spreading is a direct result of mixing and reworking of several tephra layers. The mixing, in turn, appears to be related to the influence of wind in a marshy environment.

However, in large, shallow eutrophic lakes, severe sediment resuspension and algal proliferation lead to high concentrations of particles in the water, which may host active nitrogen cycling and significantly influence N2O emissions. Nevertheless, the contribution of waterborne N2O emissions and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. To explore it, this study investigated N2O flux from Taihu Lake water, China, quantified its contribution to total emissions, and elucidated the associated microbial mechanisms using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed that N2O flux from Taihu Lake water significantly contributed to total emissions, accounting for an annual average of 34.1 %, with contributions exceeding 50 % in spring and winter. In contrast, during autumn, the water served as a sink for N2O. A variety of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms were detected in the water, which regulate the source-sink dynamics and intensity of N2O emissions. From 2006 to 2023, the total N2O emissions from Taihu Lake water amounted to 5382.7 Tg, exhibiting a declining trend over time. When tracing N2O emissions and developing mitigation strategies for large, shallow, eutrophic lakes, it is essential to consider the contribution of the water column rather than attributing the sources solely to sediments.					wenqing, shi/JCO-4345-2023; Liu, Boyi/C-9181-2012														0043-1354	1879-2448				NOV 1	2025	286								124267	10.1016/j.watres.2025.124267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.124267								40714710					WOS:001558345700006

Aquaculture depredation by double-crested cormorants breeding in Eastern North America	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) has undergone population expansion throughout much of its historical range since the 1970s, resulting in increased pressure on foraging habitats including real and perceived competition with commercial and sport fisheries and impacts on the aquaculture industry. The specific objectives of this study were to determine the stable isotope ratios of birds wintering at aquaculture facilities and natural freshwater and marine habitats, and to determine what percent of birds at distinct breeding colonies wintered in each of these habitats. We exploited natural variation in isotopic ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (from feathers) to determine the winter habitat use (i.e., aquaculture, natural freshwater, or marine) of birds collected on their summer breeding grounds in the eastern United States (from Minnesota to Vermont). The distribution of winter habitat use varied significantly across breeding colonies and between male and female cormorants. More specifically, use of aquaculture winter habitat was most prevalent in birds breeding in Lake Huron and Lake Erie. Overall, aquaculture habitats were used more by males, and marine habitats were used more by females. The stable isotope approach used in this study provided dietary confirmation of previously observed migratory patterns in the double-crested cormorant. Because aquaculture was primarily used by males, and these males migrated to a broad range of breeding colonies, we suggest that targeting breeding birds to reduce aquaculture depredation is a less efficient strategy than managing birds at depredation sites on the wintering grounds.

Characterizing the role of hydrological processes on lake water balances in the Old Crow Flats, Yukon Territory, Canada, using water isotope tracers	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We employ water isotope tracers to assess hydrological processes controlling lake water balances in the Old Crow Flats (OCF) landscape, northern Yukon Territory, Canada. Fifty-six lakes were sampled in June and July 2007 and 26 of these were re-sampled in September 2007. Based on patterns of isotopic evolution in delta O-18-delta H-2 space, calculations of input water compositions (delta(I)) and evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios, and field observations we identify snowmelt-dominated, rainfall-dominated, groundwater-influenced, evaporation-dominated and drained lake types, which represent the dominant hydrological process influencing the lake water balance. These results highlight the diversity in lake water balance conditions in the OCF, which are strongly associated with landscape characteristics. Snowmelt-dominated lakes are located where more dense vegetation cover entraps snow transported by prevailing northeasterly winds. Rainfall-dominated lakes occupy areas of sparse tundra vegetation cover where less snow accumulates. Groundwater-influenced oxbow lakes are located along the floodplain of higher-order river and creek channels and receive input throughout the ice-free season from snowmelt-recharged channel fens and sub-surface flow. Only one basin became evaporation-dominated during the 2007 open-water season probably because extremely high precipitation during the preceding late summer, late winter and early spring offset vapour loss. However, rainfall-dominated lakes appear to be more susceptible to evaporative drawdown than snowmelt-dominated and groundwater-influenced lakes, and many would likely evolve to evaporation-dominated during drier summers. Drained lakes are commonly observed throughout the landscape and in most cases likely result from elevated water levels and channel erosion between water-bodies. Unusually high amounts of snowmelt and/or rainfall triggered the drainage of two lakes in early June 2007 in which overflow led to rapid erosion of outlet channels. Our classification of lake types and corresponding isotopic evolution patterns are likely typical of other thermokarst landscapes and their identification could be used to better predict hydrological responses to ongoing climate change.

Ecosystem response to atmospheric N inputs is, in part, determined by internal production and consumption of this Limiting nutrient. The objectives of this 2-yr study on plots dominated by birch, spruce, or alder were to quantify forest floor and surface soil net and gross N mineralization rates, and examine potential effects of changes in temperature and moisture on these processes Gross N mineralization rates were 23 times net mineralization rates, and increased with forest floor/soil temperature and moisture. Substrate quality was a likely factor in higher gross mineralization rates beneath birch and spruce. Ammonium immobilization increased with forest floor/soil temperature and moisture. Higher net N mineralization rates beneath alder resulted from lower microbial immobilization rather than greater gross N mineralization. The greatest differences between gross N mineralization and immobilization occurred in early summer. Ammonium immobilization averaged 62% of gross N mineralization. Net and gross nitrification rates differed by vegetation type, were highest in spring and fall, and increased with moisture. Gross nitrification was 19 times net nitrification rates. Nitrate immobilization increased,vith soil moisture, and equalled or exceeded gross nitrification. Net and gross N mineralization or nitrification rates were not correlated. Seasonal variation in forest Boor and surface soil N cycling coupled with high ecosystem retention of precipitation N inputs suggest streamwater N concentrations and output reflect trends in soil processes.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	1999	28	2					709	720		10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020040x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1999.00472425002800020040x													WOS:000079116500039

In this study, we investigated both the resistance and toxic potential of the akinetes (resistant cells), using cyanobacterial cultures and akinetes extracted from the sediment of Lake Aydat (France) sampled in the winter and spring. Intact and lysed akinetes were differentiated using a double control based on the autofluorescence of akinetes and SYTOX-green staining. The percentage of resistant akinetes found in several different abiotic stress conditions was highly variable, depending on the species and also on the sampling season. Thus, the resistance of akinetes and their ability to germinate seems to follow a species-specific process, and akinetes can undergo physiologic changes during the sedimentary phase of the Nostocale life cycle. This study also revealed the first evidence of anatoxin-a genes in akinetes, with anaC and anaF genes detected in akinetes from all cyanobacterial producer cultures. The low number of anaC genes, almost exclusively detected using nested PCR, in the sediment at Lake Aydat suggests a limited but existent past population of toxic Nostocales in this lake. Given the key role of akinetes in the annual cycle and subsequent summer proliferation, it can be interesting to integrate the surveillance of akinetes in the management of lakes exposed to recurrent cyanobacterial blooms.

Malisse; Stearns, Leigh A.; Feng, Dongmei			Mapping proglacial headwater streams in High Mountain Asia using PlanetScope imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Headwater streams transport nutrients, sediment, and mineral-rich groundwater downstream. In High Mountain Asia (HMA), headwater streams also funnel glacier and snow melt to sustain continuous water supply for the downstream region. These channels remain poorly mapped because of their inaccessibility and because they are smaller than the resolution of Landsat (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m). In this study, we assessed the ability of 3 m resolution PlanetScope imagery to detect the proglacial headwaters downstream of all high-altitude glaciers larger than 5 km(2) in HMA. We created 3000 manually labeled image tiles to train and evaluate computer vision (CV) against techniques common in the hydrologic remote sensing literature, specifically normalized difference water index (NDWI) thresholding and random forests (RF). Results indicate that CV best detects the headwater streams with >0.60 F1-scores, nearly 0.20 points higher than RF and 0.45 points higher than thresholding. We also assessed how errors in CV propagate to derived hydrologic information, exemplified by the biogeochemically critical measurement of stream surface area. We found that CV classifications produced surface areas with 0.98 R-2, 0.01 km(2) MAE, and 0.02 km(2) RMSE against manually labeled surface areas. We also observed the best CV performance during the spring season with 30% more skillful classification performance than in summer and fall. Our results prove the ability of PlanetScope imagery to detect and map headwater streams accurately and at scale, and that classification errors stemming from the imagery or the CV methods do not greatly impair our ability to quantify stream surface area meaningful for biogeochemical exchange and hydrology studies.

T. clavata had appeared in the lake immediately prior to the study, and its levels of infection continued to rise whereas those of D. gasterostei remained relatively steady. The main period of infection of fish by both species of parasites was late summer, but a 2nd and minor infection took place in spring. In the 1st year after its introduction T. clavata exhibited a seasonal cycle in incidence and intensity of infection and disappeared from fish in summer, but in the 2nd year this cycle was masked by increased variation in development times and lack of synchrony throughout the parasite population. T. clavata has a life span of 1 yr or less and the parasites die within the fish, mainly in summer. D. gasterostei in contrast has a life span of at least 1 year, and disappearance of the parasite from the population is probably due to death of some heavily infected fish, although it was not possible to determine if this was due directly to the presence of the parasite.																				1095-8649					1977	11	6					619	633		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1977.tb05720.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1977.tb05720.x													WOS:A1977EH82900012

This is the first thorough investigation of phosphorus geochemistry in surface sediments of the Persian Gulf (PG) and the Gulf of Oman (GO), quantifying its fractions, potential ecological risks and potential bioavailability. Five forms of phosphorus were quantified using a sequential extraction technique. TP ranged from 636.0 to 1341.3 mu g/g and 599.6-1354.1 mu g/g in the summer and winter, respectively. Calcium-bound phosphorus (Ca-P) and detrital phosphorus (De-P) were the dominant forms of TP in surface sediments, with following descending order to other forms: O-P > Fe-P > Ad-P. Inorganic phosphorus (P) comprised over 83 % of the TP in the study area's sediments, indicating a low contribution from organic phosphorus. A mean of 29.1 % and 25.3 % of TP was found to be bioavailable phosphorus during the summer and winter sampling periods, respectively. Phosphorus pollution index exceeded one at most stations in both seasons, indicating sediment phosphorus pollution. Effective management of phosphorus inputs and maintenance of phosphorus balance are recommended to prevent eutrophication and HABs in the PG and GO.																			0967-0645	1879-0100				SEP	2025	223								105524	10.1016/j.dsr2.2025.105524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2025.105524		JUL 2025											WOS:001545469200001

Water level drawdowns for hydropower, stream flow regulation, and flood control often reduce the suitability of reservoirs for water-based recreation. The gain in aggregate economic use value of outdoor recreation under three alternative water level management scenarios was measured for four reservoirs in western North Carolina as part of an interagency policy analysis. Use values were estimated using a contingent valuation survey and expert panel data. The basic question addressed by this study was whether the value recreational users place on higher water levels held longer into the summer and fall is significantly greater than the value of using these reservoirs as they were managed at the time of this study. Maintaining high water levels for longer periods during the summer and fall was found to result in considerable gains in estimated recreational benefits. While not a primary objective of this study, having these estimates provided us an opportunity to compare increased recreational benefits with the value the Tennessee Valley Authority estimated for the reduced production of electricity that would result if the lakes were manages to hold reservoir levels higher, longer into the year.																			0043-1397					FEB	1993	29	2					247	258		10.1029/92WR02023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/92WR02023													WOS:A1993KM52000004

Reactive sulfide dynamic models for predicting metal hazardous in sediments of two northern Egyptian Lakes	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												To track pollution status and bioavailability of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, and Ni, the current study's acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) models were compared to previous studies in Edku and Mariut lakes prior to 8 years. Sediment samples were collected in winter and summer 2019 from the two lakes. Metal pollution is higher in the winter than in the summer, according to SEM/AVS models. Metal toxicity is reported to have increased slightly in both lakes. According to risk quotients (RQSEM-PEL and RQSEM-TEL) the two lakes are moderately polluted. The results of the Fe/AVS ratio were in the range of 6.77 to 226.87 and 2.88 to 36.38 mu mol/ g for Edku and Mariut lakes, respectively.

Within the euphotic zone APP contributed 34% of phytoplankton biomass and 35% of primary production. Annual average APP cell number was 209 x 10(3) cells ml(-1), of which 95% were unicellular cyanobacteria, 2% were colonial cyanobacteria and 3% were eukaryotes. Three ecologically and/or morphologically different groups of APP were recognized: (i) unicellular cyanobacteria belonging to the genus Cyanobium, (ii) eukaryotic species growing in early spring under isothermal conditions and (iii) cyanobacteria, partly colonial species, growing in the stratified period in the euphotic zone. Three species of eukaryotic green algae were identified: Choricystis minor, Neocystis diplococca and Pseudodictyosphaerium jurisii, the latter two being colonial. This is the first record of the occurrence of colonial eukaryotes potentially of APP size in fresh waters. In summer picocyanobacteria were highly productive so the low net increase rates indicate that losses must be high. The dominant, Cyanobium population started growing in February with maximum abundance in late April, contributing significantly to the spring peak in phytoplankton biomass. During this growth period, the population was evenly distributed in the 60 m water column. By the time the maximum biomass occurred, inorganic nutrients had decreased below analytically detectable levels. Parallel to the onset of stratification a part of the population was grazed, most probably in the microbial loop and primarily in the upper 10-15 m. The rest of the Cyanobium population accumulated in a narrow layer in the upper hypoliminon. The APP remaining from the spring was persistent for much of the summer in this cold, high-nutrient (especially nitrate)/low-light environment. Short phosphorus-turnover times suggest that APP is probably phosphate-limited. The stability of the thermocline and the pattern of thermocline development in May affected the accumulation of the APP cells in the upper hypolimnion. Thus, this process is sensitive to the physical stability of the water column.

J	BISEROV, VI				BISEROV, VI			LIMNETIC TARDIGRADES OF SOME AREAS IN THE USSR	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												There were 28 species of tardigrades found in water reservoirs of the European part of the USSR and in the Lake Issyk-Kul. Among them six are new for the fauna of the USSR: Dactylobiotus haplonyx, Da. selenicus, Doryphoribius macrodon, Isohypsibius marcellinoi, Thulinia ruffoi, T. stephaniae. Doryphoribius polynettae sp. n. is described with particular dorsal and ventral sculpture, narrow buccal tube and other miner peculiar features. Macrobiotus ovoglabellus sp. n. is well distinguished from the other species of the genus by its smooth freely deposited eggs. In spring the number of tardigrades in water reservoirs is the largest and in summer.sbd.the smallest. Probably it depends on the water temperature since in cold water reservoirs or at a depth more than 30 m they successfully grow in summer as well.																			0044-5134					DEC	1988	67	12					1798	1811																WOS:A1988R679200004

A deglacial and Holocene record of climate variability in south-central Alaska from stable oxygen isotopes and plant macrofossils in peat	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We used stable oxygen isotopes derived from bulk-peat (delta O-18(TOM)), in conjunction with plant macrofossils and previously published carbon accumulation records, in a 14,500 cal yr BP peat core (HT Fen) from the Kenai lowlands in south-central Alaska to reconstruct the climate history of the area. We find that patterns are broadly consistent with those from lacustrine records across the region, and agree with the interpretation that major shifts in delta O-18(TOM) values indicate changes in strength and position of the Aleutian Low (AL), a semi-permanent low-pressure cell that delivers winter moisture to the region. We find decreased strength or a more westerly position of the AL (relatively higher delta O-18(TOM) values) during the Bolling-Allerod, Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), and late Holocene, which also correspond to warmer climate regimes. These intervals coincide with greater peat preservation and enhanced carbon (C) accumulation rates at the HT Fen and with peatland expansion across Alaska. The HTM in particular may have experienced greater summer precipitation as a result of an enhanced Pacific subtropical high, a pattern consistent with modern delta O-18 values for summer precipitation. The combined warm summer temperatures and greater summer precipitation helped promote the observed rapid peat accumulation. A strengthened AL (relatively lower delta O-18(TOM) values) is most evident during the Younger Dryas, Neoglaciation, and the Little Ice Age, consistent with lower peat preservation and C accumulation at the HT Fen, suggesting less precipitation reaches the leeward side of the Kenai Mountains during periods of enhanced AL strength. The peatlands on the Kenai Peninsula thrive when the AL is weak and the contribution of summer precipitation is higher, highlighting the importance of precipitation seasonality in promoting peat accumulation. This study demonstrates that delta O-18(TOM) values in peat can be applied toward understand large-scale shifts in atmospheric circulation over millennial timescales. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Snow Drought Rick and Susceptibility in the Western United States and Southwestern Canada	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In western North America (WNA), mountain snowpack supplies much of the water used for irrigation, municipal, and industrial uses. Thus, snow droughts (a lack of snow accumulation in winter) can have drastic ecological and socioeconomic impacts. In this study, the historical (1951-2013) frequency, severity, and risk (frequency x severity) of dry, warm, and warm and dry snow droughts are quantified at the grid-cell and ecoregion scale for snow-dominated regions in the western United States and southwestern Canada (sWNA). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, relationships between mean winter temperature, snow drought risk, and snow water equivalent sensitivity are explored. Piecewise linear regression is used to identify temperature thresholds for mapping temperature-related snow drought susceptibility. Results highlight spatial differences in snow drought regimes across sWNA and reveal that temperature thresholds exist at -3.1 degrees C (+/- 0.3 degrees C) and 1.4 degrees C (+/- 0.3 degrees C), above which the warm snow drought risk increases more rapidly. Approximately 3% of the nonglaciated snow storage in this region has high susceptibility to temperature-related snow drought, representing 11 km(3) of water, or approximately one third the capacity of Lake Mead. Under a +2 degrees C climate scenario, an additional 8% (28 km(3)) of this snow storage volume will transition to high susceptibility. Plain Language Summary In western North America, mountain snowpack fills reservoirs for agricultural, municipal, and industrial uses and sustains streamflow in summer when ecosystem needs are high. Thus, snow droughts (a lack of snow accumulation in winter) can have large social, economic, and environmental impacts. An analysis of the frequency and severity of past snow droughts shows that warm and dry winter conditions occurring together produce the most severe snow droughts, while warm winter conditions alone produce the least severe snow droughts. The severity and frequency of warm snow droughts, however, is dependent on mean winter temperature, and the risk of warm snow droughts is substantially higher for locations with mean winter temperatures above -3.1 degrees C (+/- 0.3 degrees C). Approximately 3% of the volume of the western United States' and southwestern Canada's nonglaciated snowpack is highly susceptible to warm snow droughts, and an additional 24% exhibits medium susceptibility.

Late Quaternary dynamics of southern Africa's winter rainfall zone	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Variations in the nature and extent of southern Africa's winter rainfall zone (WRZ) have the potential to provide important information concerning the nature of long-term climate change at both regional and hemispheric scales. Positioned at the interface between tropical and temperate systems, southern Africa's climate is influenced by shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the westerlies, and the development and position of continental and oceanic anticyclones. Over the last glacial-interglacial cycle substantial changes in the amount and seasonality of precipitation across the subcontinent have been linked to the relative dominance of these systems. Central to this discussion has been the extent to which the region's glacial climates would have been affected by expansions of Antarctic sea-ice, equatorward migrations of the westerlies, more frequent/intense winter storms and an expanded WRZ. This paper reviews the developing body of evidence pertaining to shifts in the WRZ, and the evolution of ideas that have been presented to explain the patterns observed. Dividing the region into three separate axes, along the western and southern margins of the continent and across the interior into the Karoo and the Kalahari, a range of evidence from both terrestrial sites and marine cores is considered, and potential expansions of the WRZ expansions are explored. Despite the limitations of many of the region's proxy records, a coherent pattern has begun to develop of a significantly expanded WRZ during phases of the last glacial period, with the best-documented being between 32-17 ka. While more detailed inferences will require the recovery and analysis of longer and better-dated records, this synthesis provides a new baseline for further research in this key region.

J	BREDIN, D; SKINNER, J; TAMISIER, A				BREDIN, D; SKINNER, J; TAMISIER, A			SPATIOTEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION AND TIME-BUDGETS OF WATERFOWL WINTERING AT ICHKEUL, A LARGE WINTER QUARTER IN TUNISIA - A PRELIMINARY APPROACH	ACTA OECOLOGICA-OECOLOGIA GENERALIS												Lake Ichkeul in Northern Tunisia is one of the largest wetlands in N. Africa, and the most important wintering ground for waterfowl in the Maghreb. Despite international efforts to protect the National Park, it is under threat due to the construction of dams on the six inflowing rivers, the first two of which are already complete. The work reported on here was conceived as a contribution to a managment plan which tried to reconcile the economic and ecological viewpoints, and treats the use of the lake by waterfowl during the winter 1982-1983. Ichkeul consists of a 9,000 ha permanent lake and 3,000-5,000 ha of surrounding seasonally flooded marshes. The water level and salinity follow cycles typical of mediterranean lagoons: high and fresh in winter (ca 5 g/l), low and saline in summer (.ltoreq. 20 g/l). The majority of the 100,000-200,000 wintering birds are Wigeon Anas penelope, Pochard Aythya ferina and Coot Fulica atra, with 5,000-18,000 Greylag Geese Anser anser. All of these herbivorous species use the area in a quite different way, and the lake and marshes play a well defined role for each. The Scirpus maritimus marshes provide a feeding ground for the geese, and the Potamogeton pectinatus in the lake are the principal source of food for the other three. The "lake + marsh" combination satisfies all the habitat requirements of the Wigeon, Coot and Geese, and satisfies partially those of the Pochard, a proportion of which feed outside the National Park. This almost complete autonomy as far as waterfowl are concerned is surprising given the presence of a large wintering population in such a small area. This suggests either that the food resources available to the birds are particularly rich, or that other wintering grounds, where the density of waterfowl is considerably less, are underexploited. The carrying capacity of Ichkeul is limited by two intercorrelated factors: firstly the water level, whose importance was underlined during the particularly wet winter of 1982-1983. The Potamogeton pectinatus beds in the lake which are easily accessible at low water levels become progressively out of reach to Wigeon, Coot. and Pochard at water levels of 0.6, 1.5 and 2.0 m respectively. A rise in water level causes a local movement into the marshes, followed by a complete departure from the Park. Secondly, disturbance by hunters and by fishermen who gain access to the marshes at high water levels, reduces still further the area available to waterfowl.																			0243-766X						1986	7	1					55	73																WOS:A1986A821600005

Using the hourly CFSR wind fields as forcing, an attempt was made to produce a comprehensive hydrodynamic and sea state conditions data set. By comparing the wave results to various in-situ and satellite measurements, an obvious seasonal difference was observed. Wave conditions were well reproduced during winter while the wave height was generally overestimated and scattered during the summer period. After comparing the wind fields against measurements it was believed that other sources were playing an important role in wave growth and propagation. Based on available measurements, it was shown that in the summer period, where the air temperature is higher than the sea temperature, wave growth rate is lower than in the winter period. Similar real cases have been reported in some lakes, but the influence of atmospheric stability on wave climate in a relatively large sea like The Gulf has not been documented yet to the authors' knowledge. This paper focuses on the importance of including atmospheric stability effects into wave modelling. In order to account for the stability effects, the friction velocity and surface roughness were modified in the 3rd generation wind-wave model, MIKE 21 SW, using the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Improvements were seen in the quality of modelled wave heights in the summer period. The Gulf is also highly affected by changes in the sea water density. The effects of varying water density on wave climate were also studied in this paper. In order to reproduce the best quality wave climatology in The Gulf, it was concluded that seasonal modelling is required and the effects of atmospheric stability should be included.																					978-0-7918-5655-0				2015									V007T06A059															WOS:000379707200059
J	Healy, BD; Lonzarich, DG				Healy, BD; Lonzarich, DG			Microhabitat use and behavior of overwintering juvenile coho salmon in a Lake Superior tributary	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Little is known about the behavior of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch established in the Lake Superior drainage in the late 1960s. Unlike in their native range of the Pacific coast, Lake Superior coho salmon juveniles inhabit streams characterized by low winter flows and highly variable summer flows. Because high stream flows can profoundly affect fish behavior and distribution, we hypothesized that the winter ecology of coho salmon in Lake Superior streams would differ from patterns described for Pacific coast populations. Snorkeling surveys completed in winter 1998 examined the distribution and social organization of overwintering coho salmon in simple and complex pools of a Lake Superior tributary in Wisconsin. In both habitat types, coho salmon occupied focal positions in the main channel; however, fish were more tightly distributed and closer to the streambanks in simple pools. Aggressive interactions also were more common in simple pools. These results contrast sharply with research findings from Pacific coast streams, which generally show juvenile coho salmon moving to protected habitats and becoming less aggressive in winter. This study provides new insights into the behavioral plasticity of coho salmon and may aid in efforts to manage Great Lakes coho salmon populations.

Radio transmitters were implanted in large perch (27-37 cm) in a shallow lake in Denmark. Between 6 and 13 perch were tracked every 3 h for 24-h periods twice (summer) or once a month (winter) from August 1997 to July 1998. Activity levels were recorded as minimum distance moved per hour. 2. No significant differences in activity levels of individual fish were observed. 3. Highest activities were observed at daytime with peaks at dawn and dusk or midday. This diel pattern was most pronounced from October to April, whereas diel variations were less in the summer months, with no peaks occurring in midsummer. The general lack of activity at night supports the idea that perch is a visually oriented forager. 4. There was no significant relationship between daytime activity during the year and temperature or day length, but nighttime activity was correlated with temperature. In contrast with previous findings, activity levels varied little seasonally, except for high activity levels that occurred concomitantly with high temperatures in August. Instead, we found a significant relationship between the total distances moved per day and temperature, indicating that perch moved at the same average speed in the wintertime, but did so for shorter periods than in summer because of shorter day lengths. 5. Diet of the tagged perch shifted from fish dominance between August and January to invertebrates from February to June. There was no correlation between the diet shift and activity levels, indicating that feeding on invertebrate requires similar activity levels as predation on fish. 6. The results of this telemetry study throughout a year suggest that perch are more active during the winter than previously inferred from gill-net catches. This observation underscores the importance of perch as a predator of 0+ planktivorous fish in lakes and has potential implications for pelagic food web structure and lake management by biomanipulation.

However, the drivers of OC deposition in shallow floodplain lakes remain unclear due to complex terrestrial and aquatic interactions. Using 8 yr of monthly sediment trap data in a cross-ecosystem experiment on six UK shallow lakes of varying riverine connectivity, we investigated the role of allochthonous (fluvial materials) vs. autochthonous (phytoplankton production) deposits as the OC supply to lake sediments. Organic carbon sedimentation rates in river-connected (1.3 +/- 1.2 g C m-2 d-1, mean +/- SD) and isolated lakes (0.5 +/- 0.4 g C m-2 d-1) surpassed those previously published for temperate zone eutrophic lakes. Generalized linear mixed-effect models identified water column chlorophyll a as the best predictor of OC sedimentation for most lakes, suggesting that autochthonous phytoplankton production was the dominant driver of OC sedimentation, albeit stimulated by riverine nutrient supply. Carbon (C) transfer to the sediments was modulated by flow; during major floods, phytoplankton was likely flushed out of lakes, reducing OC sedimentation. Inorganic carbon sedimentation intermittently contributes substantially to carbon deposition in spring, summer, and winter. This study evidenced that shallow floodplain lakes are important sites for C deposition, with maximum C transfer to the sediments during the growing season. Future increases in hydrological variability could negatively impact the capacity of shallow floodplain lakes to retain and sequester carbon.

Foraging ecology of Bowfin (Amia calva), in the Lake Huron-Erie Corridor of the Laurentian Great Lakes: Individual specialists in generalist populations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The foraging ecology of bowfin (Amia calva) is relatively unknown in the Laurentian Great Lakes despite comparable abundances to other piscivorous predators. We investigated bowfin foraging ecology by determining trophic position, isotopic niche size, dietary proportions, and the degree of individual specialization at two locations in the Lake Huron Erie Corridor using carbon (6(13)C) and nitrogen (6(15)N) stable isotopes and stomach content analysis. Trophic position did not differ between Mitchell's Bay (4.2) and Peche Island (43) using 6(15)N, but both sites had large ranges in individual estimates (range = 2.8). Bowfin isotopic niche size was large across site, season, and tissue, suggesting a generalist feeding strategy at the population level. However, bowfin had greater between individual than within-individual variation accounting for 72% and 88% of total niche size at Mitchell's Bay and Peche Island, respectively, suggesting specialist feeding strategies at the individual level. Stable isotope mixing models for Peche Island showed high proportions of crayfish (54%) and small fish (Cyprinidae spp., Lepomis spp.; 38%) in their diet, consistent with high stomach content prevalence for crayfish (spring = 75%, fall = 10%) and small fishes (spring = 19%, fall = 33%) at Peche Island. Overall, our analysis of bowfin suggests a complex foraging ecology with bowfin acting as generalist predators at the species level but exhibiting a high degree of individual specialization, warranting further study to assess their trophic role in this diverse ecosystem of conservation concern.

Coastal Cutthroat Trout Redd Counts Impacted by Natural Water Supply Variations	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												During 2001-2003, we counted redds of Coastal Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii and measured microhabitat variables at fresh redds in Irely Creek upstream of Irely Lake in a largely undisturbed watershed within Olympic National Park, Washington. Redd numbers declined abruptly in 2003, the year after a dry summer caused the dewatering of Irely Lake; therefore, we continued the redd counts during 2004-2012 to determine whether pond dewatering was a factor in the decline and whether redd counts would track Irely Lake surface area. The estimated number of redds varied from a high of 51 (in 2002) to a low of 2 (in 2006, 2007, and 2010); increases in estimated redd number occurred after wetter summers, and decreases were observed after drier summers. This pattern was significant in chi-square tests for redd number and the change in redd number with Irely Lake condition in the preceding year ( dry, semi-dry, or wet). Rather than indicating juvenile mortality, the lack of a lag in response suggests the mortality of adults that would otherwise have spawned during the subsequent spring. The clear impact of dry summers in one of the wettest regions of North America underscores the important influence of hydrology on fish, even in the absence of other disturbances.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	4					900	912		10.1080/02755947.2016.1173138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1173138													WOS:000381683600018
J	Millar, CI; Westfall, RD; Delany, DL				Millar, Constance I.; Westfall, Robert D.; Delany, Diane L.			Thermal and hydrologic attributes of rock glaciers and periglacial talus landforms: Sierra Nevada, California, USA	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												To explore thermal regimes and hydrologic capacity of rock glaciers and related periglacial talus land-forms, mini-thermochrons were deployed in and around potentially ice-embedded features of the Sierra Nevada. Results from pilot studies at 13 rock glaciers and 7 taluses indicate that outlet springs from these landforms generally do not desiccate but persist year-round as ice (frozen) in winter and flowing water in the warm season. Temperatures of water (liquid and ice) in rock-glacier outlet springs had an annual mean of -0.2 degrees C and mean of 0.6 degrees C during the warm season with very low diurnal fluctuation. These and other attributes suggest the existence of internal ice and/or permafrost supplying the springs. Air temperatures of rock-glacier matrices (1 m below the surface) versus surface air corroborate the periglacial nature of internal environments: annual air temperatures of matrices were below freezing (mean, -0.8 degrees C). Compared to surface air, especially during the warm season, matrix air temperatures were significantly colder and fluctuated less. Talus landforms followed a similar pattern, although water- and matrix air temperatures were warmer, and contrasts with surface air were not as strong as for rock glaciers. For rock glaciers and talus slopes, matrix air temperatures showed resistance (buffering) to changes in external air temperatures. Unique geomorphic conditions of rock glaciers and periglacial taluses in the Sierra Nevada appear to maintain cool-buffered thermal regimes at least partly decoupled from external air. Springs support persistent wetlands and lakes at their snouts, retaining water in otherwise semi-arid high cirques, and contribute as hydrologic reserves and critical habitat for alpine biota.

Phytoplankton, undergoing a changing aquatic environment, play a crucial role in the material cycle and energy flow of the food chain, particularly important for the unique fish species of the Tibetan Plateau. To identify the changing environment indexes and determine the response of phytoplankton composition to the environment change in alpine lakes, three lakes-Lake Qinghai, Lake Keluke and Lake Tuosu-were selected as study areas. Seasonal sampling surveys were conducted in spring and summer annually from 2018 to 2020. Our findings revealed there were significant changes in physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton in the three lakes. Bacillariophyta was the predominant phytoplankton in Lake Qinghai from 2018 to 2020, with the genera Synedra sp., Navicula sp., Cymbella sp. and Achnanthidium sp. predominated alternately. Lake Keluke alternated between being dominated by Bacillariophyta and cyanobacteria during the same period. Dolichospermum sp., a cyanobacteria, was prevalent in the summer of 2018 and 2019 and in the spring of 2020. In Lake Tuosu, Bacillariophyta was the predominant phytoplankton from 2018 to 2020, except in the summer of 2019, which was dominated by cyanobacteria. Synedra sp., Oscillatoria sp., Pseudoanabaena sp., Chromulina sp. and Achnanthidium sp. appeared successively as the dominant genera. Analysis revealed that all three lakes exhibited higher phytoplankton abundance in 2018 that in 2019 and 2020. Concurrently, they experienced higher average temperatures in 2018 than in the subsequent years. The cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and overall phytoplankton increased with temperature and decreased with salinity and NH4-N. Besides, the ratios of cyanobacteria, and the ratios of Bacillariophyta accounted in total phytoplankton increased with temperature. These findings suggest that cyanobacteria and phytoplankton abundance, especially Bacillariophyta, may have an increase tendency in the three alpine lakes under warm and wet climate.					zhang, cun/KYQ-2883-2024															1664-302X				APR 15	2024	15								1370334	10.3389/fmicb.2024.1370334	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1370334								38686112					WOS:001210856000001
J	Canion, AK; Ochs, C				Canion, AK; Ochs, C			The population dynamics of freshwater armored dinoflagellates in a small lake in Mississippi	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We investigated the temporal and spatial changes in population density of five dinoflagellates in Boondoggle Lake, a shallow, nutrient-poor lake in northern Mississippi. Dinoflagellate density and physicochemical conditions were assessed at three depths over a period of 16 months. We identified five Peridinium species (P. deflandrei, P. volzii, P. wisconsinense, P. limbatum and P. inconspicuum) and one Peridiniopsis species (P. polonicium). With the exception of P. inconspicuum, none of these species has previously been reported in Mississippi. P. deflandrei dominated the summer bloom (90% of the total dinoflagellate population) and reached a maximum population density of 2.75 X 10(5) cells/L. P. wisconsinense and P. polonicium also had maximum densities in the summer. The increase of these species coincided with the onset of temperature and oxygen stratification, and their decrease coincided with lake mixing. P. volzii and P. limbatum reached maximum abundances in the spring and were less abundant than the summer species. Declines in these species were observed at the onset of stratification, with increases again after mixing.

Lakes and forests as determinants of downstream nutrient concentrations in small mountain watersheds	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Lakes are dynamic processors of nutrients and may hold an active role in modifying the water chemistry of stream systems. In this study, we examine the influence of lakes and an important terrestrial component-forest cover-on the nutrient levels of stream water in 11 Rocky Mountain (Idaho) watersheds. Water samples were collected from the inflow and outflow of lakes with varying amounts of upstream lakes and forested area during spring runoff and summer base flow. During base flow, mean total nitrogen concentrations at the inflow of final lakes were significantly related to relative upstream lake area, increasing from 34 to 103 mu g N L-1 as upstream lake cover in the watersheds increased from 0% to 4%. Forest cover was not significantly correlated with total nitrogen concentrations exported from the watersheds. However, similar to other studies, inflow nitrate concentrations were negatively correlated with relative forest cover. At the scale of individual lakes, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved organic nitrogen increased, and nitrate was significantly reduced from inflows to outflows. The results indicate a potentially critical role of mountain lakes in governing nitrogen flux downstream, and suggest the role of lakes as nitrogen sinks or sources may reverse between spring runoff and summer base flow.

Antimicrobial activity, cytotoxic effect and characterization of marine bivalve extracts Cerastoderma glaucum	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												Cerastoderma glaucum, a marine bivalve inhabiting Lake Timsah, is surrounded by different pathogenic organisms. The present study evaluates the antimicrobial activities, cytotoxicity and characterization of C. glaucum extracts. Chloroform, methanol and acidic tissue extracts were prepared from C. glaucum collected during winter and summer seasons. Winter acidic extract exhibits potent antimicrobial activities against 21 bacterial, 2 yeast and 2 viral strains. The inhibition zone of this extract ranges from 10 mm against Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Globicatella sulfidifaciens and Bacillus (B. badius, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. pumilus) to 24 mm against Shigella flexneri. Also, the inhibition viral activities of this extract at a concentration of 62.5 mu g ml(-1) against Hepatitis A virus and Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) are 62.383% and 57.035%, respectively, with low cytotoxicity of 24.030%. Furthermore, winter acidic extract of C. glaucum has the highest total protein contents (9.8 mg ml(-1)) compared with the other extracts. Moreover, the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicates the presence of four clear low molecular weight peptides bands; 8.588, 7.237, 4.423 and 2.692 kDa. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analysis indicates the presence of 12 functional groups of proteins in winter acidic extract of C. glaucum at appropriate wavelengths.					; Omran, Nahla/AAE-6231-2019	Omran, Nahla/0000-0002-6272-5539; El-Saidy, Salwa/0000-0003-3134-970X; 													2037-4631	1720-0776				MAR	2021	32	1			SI		149	161		10.1007/s12210-020-00964-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-020-00964-0		OCT 2020											WOS:000582993900001

Spatial distribution of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) across seasonal thermal cycles in a large lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Animal movements are influenced by the environment they inhabit and the need to maximise fitness and minimise cost. As such, seasonal thermal cycles in temperate lakes play an important role in the selection of habitat by species. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is a native top predator in the Laurentian Great Lakes and currently under rehabilitation in Lake Ontario. This cold, deep-water species is known to migrate to shallower depths in the autumn to spawn, but their spatial and seasonal distribution have not been examined in detail. We quantified the residency and home ranges of 24 lake trout in eastern Lake Ontario across a full year (1 May 2017 to 30 April 2018) using acoustic telemetry to assess the influence of seasonal thermal cycles. Specifically, we used three thermal logging stations in the eastern basin, 164 acoustic receivers, and a total of over 1,000,000 detections to describe seasonal distribution. We also documented occurrences of long-distance movements (via 130 acoustic receivers located in the western basin of Lake Ontario), and thus the potential spatial overlap of populations from the eastern and western basins. During stratification (1 July-1 November), lake trout (n = 24) showed a horizontally restricted distribution in regions of deeper water in eastern Lake Ontario. A variable and broad distribution was observed around the shallower Kingston Basin shoals during isothermal (1 January-30 April), spring warming (1 May-30 June; spring mix), and autumn cooling (2 November-31 December) periods. Home range sizes ranged from 0.1 to 3,966 km(2) among all thermal cycles, with the largest observed during cooling autumn mix conditions driven by four individuals. Large variation in home range area was observed among individuals, and, thus, means were not statistically different between seasons. Three individuals occupied shallower shoals even during stratified conditions, and another individual crossed the entire lake from the east to the west end of Lake Ontario, travelling over 200 linear km in 17 days. Our results confirm that thermal regimes and spawning needs affect the spatial use of lake trout in Lake Ontario, but demonstrate that there are broad distributions during isothermal conditions, highly individualistic spatial utilisation, and inter-individual variation in spatial distribution and exploratory behaviour. All of these behaviours are consistent with other top predator species. Defining the spatial utilisation and distribution of individuals are important steps toward a better understanding of reintroduced species ecology in freshwater ecosystems. The variation of individual lake trout distribution across seasons implies that individuals may have different influences on the overall ecosystem function and potentially different responses to increasing water temperatures. These results suggest that an adaptive management approach is required when rehabilitating populations of this native fish where populating multiple habitats in an ecosystem is an objective in the face of a changing environment.

While an advanced fishery is suggested by the number of recovered fish bones, until now it has not been possible to identify the origin of the fish, or whether and how their seasonal migration was exploited. We analysed strontium isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86) in 16 cyprinid and 8 pike teeth, which were recovered at the site, both from within the fermentation pit and from different areas outside of it, by using laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Our investigation indicates three different regions of origin for the fish at the site. We find that the most commonly fermented fish, cyprinids (roach), were caught in the autumn during their seasonal migration from the Baltic Sea to the sheltered stream and lake next to the site. This is in contrast to the cyprinids from other areas of the site, which were caught when migrating from nearby estuaries and the Baltic Sea coast during late spring. The pikes from the fermentation pit were caught in the autumn as by-catch to the mainly targeted roach while moving from the nearby Baltic Sea coast. Lastly, the pikes from outside the fermentation pit were likely caught as they migrated from nearby waters in sedimentary bedrock areas to the south of the site, to spawn in early spring. Combined, these data suggest an advanced fishery with the ability to combine optimal use of seasonal fish abundance at different times of the year. Our results offer insights into the practice of delayed-return consumption patterns, provide a more complete view of the storage system used, and increase our understanding of Early Holocene sedentism among northern hunter-fisher-gatherers. By applying advanced strontium isotope analyses to archaeological material integrated into an ecological setting, we present a methodology that can be used elsewhere to enhance our understanding of the otherwise elusive indications of storage practices and fish exploitation patterns among ancient foraging societies.					; Boethius, Adam/GSN-7857-2022	Ahlstrom, Torbjorn/0000-0001-7468-5979; Boethius, Adam/0000-0002-8923-6233													1932-6203					JAN 20	2021	16	1							e0245222	10.1371/journal.pone.0245222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245222								33471822					WOS:000639428800046
J	SARKKA, J				SARKKA, J			A QUANTITATIVE ECOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE LITTORAL ZOOBENTHOS OF AN OLIGOTROPHIC FINNISH LAKE	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Bathymetric, monthly and intralacustrine variations in species composition of the macrozoobenthos and meiozoobenthos were investigated on soft and stony bottoms of Lake Konnevesi. Regional differences were significant for many variables, although the lake was expected to be homogeneous. On soft bottom macrobenthos the numbers and biomasses were generally greater in spring than in late summer and the bathymetric maxima generally occurred at a depth of 2-4 m. On stony bottoms, the variations were not as clear as on soft bottoms and the proportion of predator taxa was .apprx. 1/2, as opposed to 1/3 on soft bottoms. The seasonal distribution in numbers of meiobenthos was opposite to that of macrobenthos, showing a maximum in late summer and not in spring. Soft bottom abundances were 3.3 times higher than stony bottom abundances for macrobenthos and 8 times higher for meiobenthos. Oligochaeta, Megaloptera and Chironomidae were more abundant on soft than on stony bottoms. Hirudinea, Trichoptera and Coleoptera were more abundant in stony than on soft bottoms. Insects formed about 3/4 of the abundances and 2/3 of the biomasses. With regard to macrobenthos biomasses, if the investigating resources are limited, the sampling times ought to be reduced to 1, rather than reducing the number of sampling depths or subareas. The amounts of the merolimnic part of the zoobenthos were greater than the amounts of hololimnic zoobenthos on both kinds of bottom, and on stony bottoms the number of merolimnic fauna species was also greater than that of hololimnic fauna. On stony bottoms the number of species were higher in spring than in late summer, which is not in agreement with the assumed food diversity. The bathymetric maximum of diversity occurred at depths of between 2 and 4 m and not in deeper zones, where the stability of environment ought to increase diversity. The quantitative proportion of predators on soft bottoms was lowest at the same depths at which the diversity was highest, which is in contrast with the predation hypothesis. Examination of the numbers of species gave different results. On stony bottoms, the proportion of predators in the biomass was exceptionally high, which indicates that the predators favor stones for habitation but gather food from surrounding soft areas. A correlation analysis of the zoobenthos abundances coincided with certain niche overlap findings and certain correlation associations coincided with the results of factor analysis.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1983	20	3					157	178																WOS:A1983RX44700001

Precipitation in the Lake Baikal basin associated with different patterns of atmospheric blocking over Western Siberia	24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS: ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				24th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics	JUL 02-05, 2018	Tomsk, RUSSIA	Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys, Russian Fdn Basic Res, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch				Since 1996, a low-water period has been observed in the Lake Baikal basin. The decrease of inflow to Lake Baikal is related to reduce of the summer discharge of the Selenga River, whose basin makes 83.4% of Lake Baikal catchment area. The decrease of river discharge is mainly due to a decrease of midsummer precipitations over the basin that occurs, preferentially, when the frontal system of the East Asian summer monsoon weakens. Some authors suggested that the reason for the East Asian summer monsoon variations is the features of atmospheric circulation at the mid-and high latitudes of Eurasia. In particular, atmospheric blockings can play an important role. We previously showed the features of formation of July rainfall in the Selenga River basin in different positions of blocking over Eurasia. We showed that precipitation tends to fall out in Mongolian part of the river basin when blocking is displaced from Western Siberia (WS) to Eastern Siberia (ES). Blocking in these cases may have a dipole configuration with anticyclonic part over Eastern Siberia and cyclonic part over Mongolia. In this work we continue to study blockings over Siberia and their relations with precipitation in the Selenga River basin in July. As a result we have formulated the following summaries regarding the relationship of WS-blocking and precipitation in the Selenga basin. 1. The maximum amount of precipitation is possible in case of complete blocking offset from West to East Siberia and formation of blocking over the eastern Siberia. 2. The amount of precipitation is not high if the blocking moves from the WS to the ES without formation of blocking over the eastern Siberia. 3. Precipitation in the basin does not fall out in the case of the blocking, which weakly shifts at the end of their life cycle. 4. There is a relationship between lifetime, intensity blocking and its movement over the WS. The stronger the blocking over the WS, the less it moves.

Halophilic bacteria in a Lake Michigan drainage basin as potential biological indicators of chloride-impacted freshwaters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												There are few biological indicators for freshwater systems subjected to high chloride levels. Freshwater systems receive many forms of chloride such as road salts (e.g., NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2), fertilizers (e.g., KCl), and year-round water softener pollution. The goal our study was to investigate Halomonadaceae populations as prospective biological indicators of chloride-impacted freshwaters. The bacterial family Halomonadaceae are halophiles that generally require the presence of salt to survive, which make them an attractive candidate in determining chloride impaired areas. Field sediment surveys assessed how salt tolerant and halophilic bacteria abundance corresponded to chloride and conductivity measuremen ts. Colony forming unit (CFU) counts on modified M9 6% NaCl plates (w/v) at urbanized sites compared to the rural sites had highest counts during winter and spring when chloride concentrations were also highest. Select isolates identified as Halomonadaceae through 16S rRNA sequencing were kept as active cultures to determine the NaCl concentration and temperature preference that resulted in the isolates optimal growth. Isolates tested under 5 'C (cold) grew optimally in 2 % NaCl (w/v), whereas under 18 degrees C (warm), isolates showed optimal growth at 6 % NaCl. The majority of isolates had maximum growth in the warmer temperature, however, select isolates grew better in the cold temperature. Culture-independent methods were used and identified Halomonadaceae were widespread and permeant members of the microbial community in a lake Michigan drainage basin. Quantitative polymerasc chain reaction (qPCR) targeting Halomonadaceae genera demonstrated that abundance varied by site, but overall were present throughout the year. I lowever, community sequencing revealed there were a large relative proportion of specific Halomonadaceae populations present in winter versus summer. Methods targeting salt tolerant bacteria and specific members of Halomonadaceae appears to be a promising approach to assess chloride-impacted areas to better understand the long-term ecological impacts as we continue to salinize freshwater resources.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 10	2022	846								157458	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157458	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157458		JUL 2022						35863571					WOS:000855594500009

In addition, they are very likely to have negative impact on ecological and economic aspects. In this study, the seasonal succession of phytoplankton population in Lake Karaoun in Lebanon was monitored from May 2009 to June 2011. The physicochemical parameters of lake water were then monitored for 1 year, from June 2010 until June 2011, to correlate the physicochemical parameters with the phytoplankton population in the lake. Our results showed, for the first time in Lebanon, that the eutrophied Lake Karaoun has been under the invasion of toxic cyanobacterial blooms since May 2009. The cyanobacterial bloom was persistent from late spring (May) until late fall (December) for 2 consecutive years. The high water temperature in the summer season is the main factor that has been affecting the growth of the cyanobacteria. The most frequently encountered bloom-forming species were Microcystis aeruginosa and Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, which were either present individually or coexistent. The obtained results showed that during the period of cyanobacterial bloom, a deterioration of water quality defined by low levels of dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and electric conductivity was reported. During cyanobacterial bloom period, the concentration of the orthophosphateP (PO4-P) was very minimal. The measured high value of chlorophyll-a concentration during cyanobacterial bloom period (48.6 g/L) was attributed to high photosynthetic activity. Cyanobacterial blooms can cause a variety of water-quality problems in Lake Karaoun in addition to human health risk.					; Atoui, Ali/AAW-8705-2020	Atoui, Ali/0000-0002-7027-6067; 													1747-6585	1747-6593				MAR	2013	27	1					42	49		10.1111/j.1747-6593.2012.00324.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-6593.2012.00324.x													WOS:000315117900005

This study was conducted to provide a detailed understanding of diversity, distribution and seasonal dynamics of Dolichospermum flos-aquae populations in Taihu Lake, China. Morphological identifications showed Dolichospermum flos-aquae and Aphanizomnon flos-aquae were the two main heterocystous cyanobacteria in Taihu Lake. Phylogenetic analysis based on cpcBA-IGS sequences, the highly variable intergenic spacer (IGS) region between two phycobilisome subunits (cpcB and cpcA), distinguished Dolichospermum from other filametous cyanobacterial genera. Therefore, the real-time PCR detection of Dolichospermum flos-aquae based on cpcBA-IGS sequences was developed to study the distribution and abundance of Dolichospermum flos-aquae. The investigation began in August 2008 and extended through September 2010. Dolichospermum flos-aquae occurred throughout the entire lake. There was an average abundance of 2.0 x 10(6) gene copies L-1, and the peak abundance was in the western part of Taihu Lake during late spring when it reached 4.0 x 10(7) copies L-1. Dolichospermum flos-aquae had a regular annual cycle; it began appearing in late autumn and it reached a peak in late spring.					; Wang, Zhongjie/T-9055-2019; yang, liu/N-8925-2018; Xiao, Peng/AGS-6467-2022	Wang, Zhongjie/0000-0003-3491-417X; liu, yang/0000-0002-6963-4509; 													0031-8884	2330-2968				SEP	2013	52	5					447	454		10.2216/12-125.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/12-125.1													WOS:000325965100007

The physical and chemical properties of water including temperature, pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), hardness, as well as Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, silica, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and total phosphorus (TP) concentration, were monitored from May 2014 to January 2017. The results of statistical analysis indicated that the quality of water in the dam was affected by the depth in view of five variables of EC, pH, turbidity, SO42-, and TP (p < 0.05). Moreover, it was determined that ten out of 17 variables including EC, turbidity, TDS, Ca2+, K, Cl-, SO42-, silica, nitrate, and TP were statistically significant (p < 0.05) based on seasonal variation analyses. Comparing the mean values, it could be concluded that EC, TDS, Ca2+, K+, Cl-, and SO42- were slightly higher during the winter probably owing to the diluting effects of seasonal precipitation. Nutrient-like distribution, nitrate, and TP, as well as silica, were much higher during the spring representing a high-diatoms activity and eutrophication. Turbidity was higher in the fall compared to the other seasons, which also demonstrated rainfall effects. Evaluation of the aggressiveness index (AI) suggests that water is moderately corrosive, and noncorrosive in the winter compared to other seasons. Moreover, according to the findings of this research and their comparison with the national and international water quality guidelines/standards, it could be said that the water quality of Latyan dam during the study period was acceptable and thus it was usable as a drinking water supply. However, due to the changes occurred in nitrate and phosphorus and extensive development of eutrophication problem, accurate and continuous evaluation of water quality in this reservoir is deemed necessary.

HIMPAC Project Members	A Holocene pollen record from the northwestern Himalayan lake Tso Moriri: Implications for palaeoclimatic and archaeological research	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This paper presents a new fossil pollen record from Tso Moriri (32 degrees 54'N, 78 degrees 19'E, 4512 m a.s.l.) and seeks to reconstruct changes in mean annual precipitation (MAP) during the last 12,000 years. This high-alpine lake occupies an area of 140 km(2) in a glacial-tectonic valley in the northwestern Himalaya. The region has a cold climate, with a MAP < 300 mm, and open vegetation. The hydrology is controlled by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), but winter westerly-associated precipitation also affects the regional water balance. Results indicate that precipitation levels varied significantly during the Holocene. After a rapid increase in MAP, a phase of maximum humidity was reached between ca. 11 and 9.6 cal ka BP, followed by a gradual decline in MAP. This trend parallels the reduction in the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Comparison of different palaeoclimate proxy records reveal evidence for a stronger Holocene decrease in precipitation in the northern versus the southern parts of the ISM domain. The long-term trend of ISM weakening is overlaid with several short periods of greater dryness, which are broadly synchronous with the North Atlantic cold spells, suggesting reduced amounts of westerly-associated winter precipitation. Compared to the mid and late Holocene, it appears that westerlies had a greater influence on the western parts of the ISM domain during the early Holocene. During this period, the westerly-associated summer precipitation belt was positioned at Mediterranean latitudes and amplified the ISM-derived precipitation. The Tso Moriri pollen record and moisture reconstructions also suggest that changes in climatic conditions affected the ancient Harappan Civilisation, which flourished in the greater Indus Valley from approximately 5.2 to 3 cal ka BP. The prolonged Holocene trend towards aridity, punctuated by an interval of increased dryness (between ca. 4.5 and 4.3 cal ka BP), may have pushed the Mature Harappan urban settlements (between ca. 4.5 and 3.9 cal ka BP) to develop more efficient agricultural practices to deal with the increasingly acute water shortages. The amplified aridity associated with North Atlantic cooling between ca. 4 and 3.6 and around 3.2 cal ka BP further hindered local agriculture, possibly causing the deurbanisation that occurred from ca. 3.9 cal ka BP and eventual collapse of the Harappan Civilisation between ca. 3.5 and 3 cal ka BP.

For the latter, a floating emergence trap was used, which caught a total of 8397 insects over water area of 2.25 m2 during the summer and autumn of 1979. These insects belong to 12 families and 4 orders. Dominances, diversities and equities were determined for the Trichoptera. The results were compared with those obtained in the acidic Olba opencast residual lake northeast of Bautzen, which was investigated at the same time of year.																			0020-9309						1983	68	5					701	713		10.1002/iroh.3510680512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.3510680512													WOS:A1983RX21000007
J	Angel, JR; Isard, SA				Angel, JR; Isard, SA			An observational study of the influence of the Great Lakes on the speed and intensity of passing cyclones	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Case studies have shown that the Great Lakes can intensify and alter the speed of passing cyclones in winter by contributing latent and sensible heat to the storms. However, the influence of the Great Lakes on cyclones has not been systematically examined using an extensive dataset. In this research, a National Climate Data Center dataset for the period 1965-90 was used to examine the rate of movement and change in mean sea level pressure of 583 cyclones as they passed over the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes had a strong effect on the passing cyclones during the ice-free/unstable season from September through November. As cyclones approached the lakes during this season, they accelerated. Once in the Great Lakes region, their rate of intensification increased (the change in pressure tendency at the center of the cyclone was negative). The acceleration into the region was less for cyclones during the ice-cover/unstable season, and rates of intensification for these cyclones did not change within the region. Cyclones that traversed the Great Lakes region during the stable season from May through July exhibited essentially the same behavior as those in the ice-free/unstable season. The authors' results for the unstable seasons (ice free and ice cover) are consistent with previous modeling case studies of the influence of the Great Lakes on passing cyclones. Because the lakes are generally cooler than the overriding air during spring and summer, a satisfactory explanation for the influence of the Great Lakes on cyclones during the stable season is not apparent.

Finland during the spring snowmelt period	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Spring snowmelt in the arctic and boreal regions represents the most significant event in the hydrological year. We measured concentrations and fluxes of different carbon species in 2 small contrasting (control v drained) forested peatland catchments in E. Finland between April and June 2008 and compared these to long-term annual fluxes. Measurements were made using a combination of continuous sensors (CO2, temperature, pH, discharge) and routine spot sampling (DOC, POC, DIC, CO2, CH4, N2O). The highest concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in streamwater were observed under low flow conditions before the spring flood event, reflecting accumulation and downstream release of gaseous C at the end of the winter period. Over the length of the study mean CH4 concentrations were 10x higher in the drained site. The snowmelt event was associated with a dilution of DOC and CO2, with the drained catchment showing a much flashier hydrological response compared to the control site, and post-event, a slower recovery in DOC and CO2 concentrations. Fluxes of all carbon species during the snowmelt event were significant and represented 37-45% of the annual flux. This highlights the challenge of quantifying aquatic C fluxes in areas with large temporal variability and suggests that inability to "capture" the spring snowmelt event may lead to under-estimation of C fluxes in northern regions.

Change in area of Ebinur Lake during the 1998-2005 period	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Ebinur Lake is located in a typical arid region in the north-west of China. It is an area with the lowest elevation in the Junggar Basin in the Province of Xinjiang. Recent monitoring indicates that the lake surface area has increased. To obtain a continuous record of the change in lake area, a radiometric analysis of SPOT/ VEGETATION (VGT) imagery was carried out based on methodology developed for regional lake area mapping. Two indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), were selected to identify the water body of Ebinur Lake. The indices are calculated based on the spectral reflectances in the red and near infrared bands of VGT sensor. If the NDVI is less than a critical value (0) and if the NDWI is larger than a critical value (0), the pixel is flagged as a water body. Validation indicates that the methodology to identify water bodies based on multi-spectral VGT data is applicable in our study area achieving an overall accuracy of 91.4%. Independent monitoring results elicit that the lake surface area was at its lowest in 1998. The yearly average surface area is about 503km(2). The lake area increased to 603km(2) during 1999. In the period 1999-2001 the area changes are marginal. A large area increase occurred from 2001 to 2002 till the lake area reached a surface area of 791km(2). The lake area peaks to 903km(2) in 2003 and subsequently decreased to areas of 847km(2) in 2004 and 746km(2) in 2005. Similar area change dynamics are observed when applying the remote sensing based technique. Seasonally, the typical dynamics elicit a larger surface area in spring and winter and a smaller one during summer.

The results showed that he absorption coefficient a (CDOM)(440) ranged from 0.37 m(-1) to 3.93 m(-1) with an average of 1.89 +/- 0.76 m(-1) (+/- SD) for the aggregated dataset, and S varied from 0.0048 nm(-1) to 0.0239 nm(-1) with an average of 0.0108 +/- 0.0040 nm(-1). A significant relationship between S and a (CDOM)(440) can be fitted with a power equation (S = 0.013 x a (CDOM)(440)(-0.42), R (2) = 0.612), excluding data from Geist Reservoir during high flow (12 April 2010) and the Morse Reservoir on 25 June 2010 due to a T-storm achieves even higher determination coefficient (R (2) = 0.842). Correlation analysis indicated that a (CDOM)(440) has strong association with inorganic suspended matter (ISM) concentration (0.231 < R-2 < 0.786) for each of the field surveys, and this trend followed the aggregated datasets (R (2) = 0.447, p < 0.001). In contrast, chlorophyll-a was only correlated with a (CDOM)(440) in summer and autumn (0.081 < R (2) < 0.763), indicating that CDOM is mainly from terrigenous sources in early spring and that phytoplankton contributed during the algal blooming season. The S value was used to characterize CDOM origin. The results indicate that the CDOM source is mainly controlled by hydrological variations, while phytoplankton originated organic matter also closely linked with CDOM dynamics in three productive reservoirs.

However, limited research exists on the impact of the environment on bacterial community structure in these lakes, co-occurrence patterns and the mechanisms governing bacterial community assembly. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining samples collected from five areas of Lake Bosten over four seasons. Using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing method, we identified a total of 510 to 1,005 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to 37 phyla and 359 genera in Lake Bosten. The major bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria (46.5%), Actinobacteria (25.9%), Bacteroidetes (13.2%), and Cyanobacteria (5.7%), while the major genera were hgcI_clade (12.9%), Limnohabitans (6.2%), and Polynucleobacter (4.7%). Water temperature emerged as the primary driver of these community structure variations on global level. However, when considering only seasonal variations, pH and nitrate were identified as key factors influencing bacterial community structures. Summer differed from other seasons in aspects of seasonal symbiotic patterns of bacterial communities, community assembly and function are different from other seasons. There were notable variations in bacterial community structures between winter and summer. Deterministic processes dominated community assembly, but there was an increase in the proportion of stochastic processes during summer. In summer, the functions related to photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and decomposition of organic matter showed higher abundance. Our findings shed light on the response of bacterial communities to environmental changes and the underlying mechanisms of community assembly in oligosaline lakes in arid regions.

These lower layers may deteriorate significantly if the dissolved oxygen consummated in biochemical processes is not renewed by surface aeration or photosynthesis. Thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs can result in substantial hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, which may have a negative impact on the cold-water fisheries, the drinking-water treatment process, and water quality downstream of hydropower reservoirs. The main purpose of this study is to show the effect of hypolimetic aeration and destratification mode to improve the concentration of oxygen dissolved and level of phosphorus in the depths of the lake. The 10.3 km(2) of the water of Hallwil lake are an important tourist center for the canton of Lucerne (Switzerland). Before its restoration in the winter of the year 1985/1986, this lake eutrophication showed significant disruption of aquatic activities, and pollution damage to its various uses, and thus inhibited the development of tourism in the region. Thus, the long periods of stratifications, associated to an important amount of an organic material (principally phosphorus), were originally caused by frequent anoxic phases of the deep layers. This anoxia could be noted beyond 3 m of depth. For this, the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) in Switzerland, to address the eutrophication of Hallwil lake, put into service in the winter of 1985/1986, an installation of a aeration system in two alternate modes of aeration namely by a aeration system in winter by destratification mode and aeration hypolimnetic in summer (air/pure oxygen). Through the exhibition of the different results of the chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus) in the two aeration modes, we were able to ensure an improvement of the lake water quality As a result, the average value of oxygen dissolved and the amount of phosphorus is found in the range of allowed values are: -Winter Season: [O-2](min) >= 8 g/m(3); [P-2](max) <= 0.15 g/m(3) -Summer Season: (30 m >= H >= 15 m): [O-2](min) >= 5 g/m(3); [P-2](max) <= 0. 13 g/m(3) Consequently, we can conclude that both techniques aeration method has contributed radically in valuable way to improve the amount of dissolved oxygen and decrease the concentration of phosphorus in the deep layers of the lake.

Saline lands can be evaluated, mapped, and monitored in different world regions using satellite imaging and remote sensing techniques. In order to assess the ability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery for monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of electrical conductivity (EC) and to determine the importance of salinity indices for prediction in two seasons (summer and winter) using the systematic sampling method, from surface depth (0--20 cm), 90 soil samples were taken of marginal lands of Sirjan Playa, southeast of Iran. Satellite images for two seasons were acquired close to the sampling time to obtain the soil salinity indices. Four machine-learning algorithms, namely artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to estimate the spatiotemporal changes in soil salinity. Results confirmed that the ANN model developed by the Sentinel-2A image had the highest performance (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 16.1, NRMSE = 27.1) to predict ECe in the winter season. Furthermore, RF presents the lowest error for prediction ECe during the summer, independent type of satellite data used. Additionally, in virtually all of the analyzed models, the Sentinel-2A data produced lower RMSE and NRMSE values than the Landsat-8 data throughout the two seasons. Results also confirmed that among the soil salinity indices, the Vegetation Soil Salinity Index (VSSI) was identified as the most effective predictor. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of satellite imaging and machine learning algorithms for monitoring and predicting soil salinity, which can contribute to the sustainable management of marginal lands in arid and semi-arid regions. The findings also highlight the importance of selecting appropriate satellite data and salinity indices for accurate and reliable predictions.					; Esfandiarpour-Boroujeni, Isa/AAR-4151-2020	Esfandiarpour-Boroujeni, Isa/0000-0003-3331-7189; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2023	231								107375	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107375		JUL 2023											WOS:001039368600001

One such area is Northwest Australia, where the Australian monsoon impacts its northernmost fringes, which are bordered by the Great Sandy Desert inland. Marine sediments from the Australian Northwest Shelf record fluvial run-off and eolian dust input during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The location is therefore ideal for investigating long-term variability in the Australian monsoon and Northwest Australian dust flux over orbital timescales. However, there are few continuous, high-resolution paleoclimate records from this region spanning the early Pleistocene, when strong ice-climate feedbacks of the late Pleistocene did not yet dominate global climate. Here, we present geochemical and environmental magnetic proxy records that reveal %CaCO3 and dust-flux variability between 2.9 and 1.6 million years (Myr) ago from International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 356 Site U1464 on the Australian Northwest Shelf. We establish a new, orbitally-tuned chronology for Site U1464, primarily based on similar to 400 thousand year (kyr) eccentricity cyclicity in %CaCO3, and observe strong obliquity variability (41 and 54 kyr periodicities) but almost no precession signal in the dust-flux records. We propose that the 41 kyr cycle in Northwest Australian dust flux could be a linear response to East Asian winter monsoon intensity and/or the summer inter-tropical insolation gradient (SITIG), whereas the 54 kyr cyclicity might be a non-linear response to obliquity amplitude modulation via the SITIG effect on the cross-equatorial atmospheric circulations. This study establishes a new orbitally-constrained chronology for International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1464 Australian Northwest shelf sediments preserve similar to 400 kyr eccentricity cycles in %CaCO3 and similar to 41 kyr obliquity cycles in dust proxy records Obliquity in Northwest Australian dust flux may be related to the East Asian winter monsoon and summer inter-tropical insolation gradient					Auer, Gerald/AAE-5730-2021; Zhao, Song/K-3043-2016; Heslop, David/AGE-1592-2022; Gallagher, Stephen/AFL-9448-2022; Bolton, Clara/A-2423-2012	Bolton, Clara/0000-0002-3078-1253; Auer, Gerald/0000-0002-2574-0027; Zhao, Song/0000-0002-4943-573X; Heslop, David/0000-0001-8245-0555; Gallagher, Stephen/0000-0002-5593-2740; 													2572-4517	2572-4525				OCT	2024	39	10							e2024PA005015	10.1029/2024PA005015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024PA005015													WOS:001335498100001

Here, we examined the dynamic distribution of ARGs in a human-intensive watershed (including city, river and lake systems) over different seasons in a temperate region, as well as revealed the key factors shaping ARGs dynamics through structural equation models (SEMs). High diversity and abundance of ARGs were detected in sediments and surface water, with aminoglycoside, beta-lactamase and multidrug resistance genes dominating. PCoA showed distinct ARGs variations between the two phases. Seasonal changes and regional functions had significant impacts on the distribution patterns of ARGs. More diverse ARGs were detected in winter, while higher ARGs abundances were observed in spring and summer. The city system showed the highest level of ARGs contamination and was mainly derived from wastewater and human/animal feces based on SourceTracker analysis and ARGs indicators. Notably, watershed restoration could significantly mitigate the ARGs pollution status and improve biodiversity in the aquatic environment. Network analysis identified several hub ARGs and bacterial genera, which helped to infer potential bacterial hosts carrying ARGs. Furthermore, ARGs indicators provided insights to trace ARGs sources. SEMs indicated that bioavailable heavy metals and nutrients can greatly shape ARGs dynamics in regions with high-intensity human activities, while the microbial community and MGEs dominate the fate of ARGs in less human-impacted regions. More attention should be given to control heavy metals and nutrients to curb the spread of ARGs. Overall, this study highlights the environmental fate of ARGs and provides novel strategies to mitigate ARGs pollution in the human-intensive watershed.

The obtained results indicate that intensified agricultural utilisation of the area causes a marked increase in the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen(V), in surface waters, particularly in drainage waters. The highest concentrations of N-NO(3) occur in winter (on average 17.38 mg.dm(-3)) in drainage waters flowing from the intensively utilised area, and the lowest in watercourses, particularly in spring and summer (0.13 divided by 0.25 mg.dm(-3)). The load of N-NO(3) flowing from the agricultural catchment depends on the meteorological conditions, the type of drainage system and the intensity of the catchment utilisation. A substantial part (about 45%) of the yearly charge of N-NO(3) occurs in wintertime. It is a result of an intensive inflow of nitrogen with the thawing snow and precipitation in the period of limited bioaccumulation. The results of the research indicate a potential negative influence of the waters flowing from agricultural areas, mostly through drainage systems, on the waters of Dobskie Lake. Considering high concentrations and loads of nitrates in the waters flowing into the lake, we can qualify it as exposed to eutrophication. This confirms the importance of regarding the area as one where the flow of nitrogen from agricultural sources ought to be limited.																			1898-617X						2008	2	2					473	478																WOS:000263782500035

Considering the guideline for biological criteria issued by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and combining the physical and chemical factors, the primary framework for developing ecological criteria was provided The framework includes 4 steps: (1) Determined the reference sites and watershed ecological characteristics (2) Drew box plots for reference sites and scoring (3)Added the scores of ecological criteria indices by equal weight and set 90 quantile as the value of Index of Ecological Integrity(IEI) (4)identifying IEI, DO and Chl a relations to developing ecological criteria. The values of DO ecocriteria of Tai Lake were 10.37 (2009 summer) and 10.30 (2010 summer). The values of Chl a ecocriteria were 4.61(2009 summer) and 4.53 (2010 summer). The winter data is not suitable for the calculation of ecocriteria. Basically, the method based on the variety of plankton communities is feasible to calculate the values of ecological criteria.

The extent of DVM varied with the size of the animal and its reproductive state. Migration distances were shortest in immature specimens and longest in ovigerous females. During daytime, ovigerous females stayed deeper in the water column than females without ova or immatures. The daytime temperature of water at the median depth of the ovigerous females did not exceed 10-degrees-C, even in the warmest season. At night they migrated upward to an environment which was warmer by as much as 9-degrees-C. Laboratory observations indicate that specimen's size and water temperature determine the velocity of passive sinking, such that morning descent of the different groups of Daphnia can be explained by passive sinking alone. Our hypothesis is that the distribution of different groups of D. hyalina in Lake Bled is influenced by two types of predators: fish (Perca fluviatilis L. and Rutilus rutilus (L.)) and larvae of Chaoborus flavicans (Meig.), the latter appearing in the epilimnion during the night. Fish predation has a key-role at the beginning of thermal stratification. Supposing that in spring the gene pool of Daphnia consists of a mix of different genotypes, distributed at different depths during the day, fish predation combined with a presence of fish chemicals favored genotypes with a lower day-depth during the spring/summer period.

Time series Landsat (TM and ETM+) satellite data products have been employed in this study to quantify the spatiotemporal Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Urban Heat Island (UHI) intensity for the year of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015, respectively. Biophysical characteristics of the city have been assessed through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI). The thermal behavior of the city varied distinctly. Seasonal LST and biophysical composition of the city has been analyzed to explore the temperature and greenness sensitivity across the city region. The per capita electricity consumption of the city was positively correlated with the surface LST for both summer and autumn/spring season. A relative brightness temperature approach was employed to examine the nature of UHI across the city. It is evident from the observation that the temperature is very high within the city core as well as certain surrounding areas of the city, especially on the southern side. The temperature is comparatively lower on the western side of the city than the eastern region. Certain peripheral regions, however, show a higher temperature. This can be due to the development taking place in the outer areas of the city and destruction of vegetation in the outlying parts of the city. Studied NDVI indicates that vegetation in the city is not balanced. It is high in the western part which maybe because of the locations of different academic institutions, botanical gardens, seminary hills, agricultural land, etc. Whereas, the eastern part is devoid of vegetation. Also, the areas in the periphery, especially near the airport and Ambajhari Lake, has very low vegetation. The bareness is also high in the peripheral regions. Result also shows that street-based heat intensity mitigation helps for urban planning.

The pedologic-lithologic profile is divided into four main horizons: (1) at the surface, a cultural horizon (0-50 cm) clayey and loamy with granular structure; (2) a weathered layer from 50 to 90 cm, also clayey and loamy, but with a compact structure; (3) a fine sandy horizon between 90 and 120 cm; and (4) at the bottom clayey moraine deposits from 120 cm downwards. Measurements were made of precipitation, soil water content, and discharge at the outlet of the basin. Discharges varied between 6 and 53 l s-1 and reflected the snowy-rainy regime of the basin which received 1036 mm during the twelve-month study. The soil humidity indicates three periods: (1) in summer, a drying period which affects a depth of 90 cm; (2) wetting during autumn which modifies the water content of only the upper 45 cm: and (3) during the winter and spring, saturation of the soil. Tensiometric measurements show a desaturation with upward water movement during the period from September to November. Then a saturation of the whole profile occurs from November to June. This latter period indicates that the 45-80 cm layer acts as a water reservoir. The data monitoring exhibits two systems of flow movement in the soil: (1) a superficial one, which facilitates runoff or subsurface lateral movement, linked directly to precipitation; and (2) a lower system, practically independent from the previous one, originating outside the basin. The water balance in the basin showed an excess of 346 mm over the total of 1036 mm of precipitation. The knowledge of the isotopic gradient of the region suggests a recharge at a mean altitude of 700 m. The water behaviour in the superficial system is directly linked to precipitations the isotopic signal of which moves downwards in the soil. Hydrograph separation of discharge at the outlet indicates the origin of the different flow components. When the runoff flow starts in the river bed after the dry season it is the sandy layer which provides the major flow. Then when the saturation level reached one can observe lateral subsurface flow. In some special cases (snowmelt) a pure runoff is recognizable, caused by the frozen soil. In conclusion, this study emphasizes on the essential role played by the texture and structure contrasts of the pedologic-lithologic horizons of the fluvioglacial deposits which "condition" the different flow components: pure runoff, and/or hypodermic movement, and/or infiltration to recharge the aquifer.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				AUG	1989	109	3-4					369	385		10.1016/0022-1694(89)90025-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(89)90025-5													WOS:A1989AQ64200010

Marine Mammals in the Crimean Conservation Areas	TWELFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE MEDITERRANEAN COASTAL ENVIRONMENT (MEDCOAST 15), VOLS 1 AND 2					12th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment (MEDCOAST)	OCT 06-10, 2015	Varna, BULGARIA	Mediterranean Coastal Fdn, Inst Oceanol, Inst Fish Resources, Republ Turkey, Promot Fund				Crimean marine protected areas (MPAs) (32) have different conservation levels: Natural Reserves (Sary Bulat Islands, Karadag, Martyan Cape, Kazantip, and Opuk), National Natural Park in Tarkhankut Peninsula (Beautiful Harbour), nature sanctuaries (Aya and Fiolent Capes, Cossack, or Kazak, Bay, Bakal Spit, etc.), fragmentary small "coastal aqueous complexes" (Ay Todor and Placa Capes, some rocky coastal complexes and bays in the different parts of coastline, Donuzlav Lake, Arabat Spit, Chersonese (Hersonissos), etc.) as a part of terrestrial reserved areas. Black Sea cetacean species (3) are very important in marine environment as a top predator of food pyramids, the main link in trophic chains and interspecific relations in aqueous communities. The materials obtained from polling of 3,512 university students, specialists of reserved structures, local residents and volunteers in 2002-14, and some field excursions in 1997-14 were analyzed; 591 sightings and 245 strandings were reported. Harbour porpoises (HP), bottlenose (BD) and common dolphins were observed in the different MPAs, but the most of sightings/strandings we recorded in coastal part of Martyan Cape and Nikita Botanical Garden (18/7 cases), Karadag (21/6), Kazantip (14/29), Opuk (17/6), Tarkhankut Cape and adjoining area (20/7), Aya (16/6) and Fiolent (32/9) Capes, Bakal Spit (126/33), Cossack, or Kazak, Bay (17/11), Ay Todor (21/5) and Placa (23/12) Capes, Donuzlav Lake (23/8), Arabat Spit (32/24), Chersonese, or Hersonissos, (6/11), New World, or Novy Swet, Bays and adjoining coastline (50/6), Kuchuk Uzen - Kuru Uzen Coastline (48/24), etc. BD and HP dominated in sightings (44.9% and 42.8%), while HP dominated in strandings (72.4%). Sightings/strandings registered mainly in summer (75.6%/63.3%), but also in spring (10.0%/14.3%), autumn (7.8%/4.5.8%) and winter (1.2%/4.5%). Winter occurrence was recorded in Cossack (Kazak) Bay, Aya, Ay Todor and Placa Capes, Karadag, etc. The highest peaks of sightings/strandings were observed in 2005 (8.1/9.0%), 2006 (8.6/10.0%), 2008 (9.5/7.8%), and 2009 (8.3/8.2%). These data confirm existing tendencies in fluctuations of cetacean distribution in other parts of coastline. Ratio of sightings and strandings demonstrates regional variation and demands different approaches for more special monitoring research. HP is the most vulnerable species and requires the highest protection level compared to other cetaceans. In this light, MPAs should expand to the main part of coastal region (ecosystem-based management) rather than be a system of new protected small seascapes or enclaves. The establishment of integrated MPA (Biosphere Reserve and/or Natural Park) in the Crimea coastal zone is the most preferable variant. Retrospective monitoring is the most effective approach in cetacean research in Crimea MPAs. Questionnaire survey coupled with field excursions proves to be a cost-effective method of cetacean study.																					978-605-85652-3-4				2015							207	218																WOS:000377577200021

Subglacial brine flow and wind-induced internal waves in Lake Bonney, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Brine beneath Taylor Glacier has been proposed to enter the proglacial west lobe of Lake Bonney (WLB) as well as from Blood Falls, a surface discharge point at the Taylor Glacier terminus. The brine strongly influences the geochemistry of the water column of WLB. Year-round measurements from this study are the first to definitively identify brine intrusions from a subglacial entry point into WLB. Furthermore, we excluded input from Blood Falls by focusing on winter dynamics when the absence of an open water moat prevents surface brine entry. Due to the extremely high salinities below the chemocline in WLB, density stratification is dominated by salinity, and temperature can be used as a passive tracer. Cold brine intrusions enter WLB at the glacier face and intrude into the water column at the depth of neutral buoyancy, where they can be identified by anomalously cold temperatures at that depth. High-resolution measurements also reveal under-ice internal waves associated with katabatic wind events, a novel finding that challenges long-held assumptions about the stability of the WLB water column.

The measurements were made during winter, summer, and fall; concurrently, in Chicago, IL; over Lake Michigan onboard the U.S. EPA RV Lake Guardian; and in South Haven, MI. The flux of Pb, Cu, and Zn was substantially higher in Chicago than in either South Haven or over Lake Michigan. The average measured Pb, Cu, and Zn fluxes were 0.07, 0.06, and 0.20 mg m(-2) day(-1) in Chicago; 0.003, 0.01, and 0.01 mg m(-2) day(-1) over Lake Michigan; and 0.004, 0.007, and 0.004 mg m(-2) day(-1) in South Haven. When the wind was from Chicago over the lake, the fluxes and concentrations measured over the lake: were higher than when the wind was from other directions. In general,these anthropogenic metals had higher, concentrations in the fine particle mode than in the coarse particle mode. Modeled and measured fluxes were in reasonable agreement. Coarse particles were found to be responsible for the majority of the flux at all locations.					; Sofuoglu, Sait C./A-6193-2018; Sofuoglu, Sait/A-6193-2018	Holsen, Thomas/0000-0001-9599-6733; Sofuoglu, Sait C./0000-0001-6990-0275; 													0013-936X					JUN 1	1998	32	11					1629	1635		10.1021/es970892b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es970892b													WOS:000074032700030

Samples were taken every two weeks during 1982 up until August 1983. Water samples were analzyed for total phosphorus (TP), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and were centrifuged in the field using a continuous flow centrifuge to recover the suspended solids following sieving at 63 .mu.m. The <63 .mu.m solids were analyzed for total particulate phosphorus (TPP), organic phosphorus (OP), apatite phosphorus (AP) and non apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP). The >63 .mu.m were similarly analyzed and the weight of total solids in both size fractions recorded. Results were compared throughout the period of record to the hydrograph situated at Porte de Scex. The annual cycle of the Rhone can be divided into a low turbidity, low flow winter period (SED1)and high flow, high turbidity summer season designated (SED 2). Turbidity is well related to discharge. The >63 .mu.m sediment is mobilized at 200 m3s-1 and thereafter increases in concert with, though at a faster rate than, the <63 .mu.m fraction. The coarse fraction contains significant quantities of phosphorus and in 1982 accounted for 26% of the TPP loading. OP and NAIP are higher in SED 1 than in SED 2 though AP remains constant throughout the year. OP is believed to be driven primarily from point sources whereas NAIP, in addition to point sources, has secondary sources in spring and summer due to sheet erosion from the agricultural soils of the valley. Loadings of phosphorus were calculated by four methods which showed internal consistency though they were higher than previous estimates. Bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) was estimated to account for some 20% of the total phosphorus loading of some 1500 tonnes; BAP is here taken to be the sum of SRP and NAIP and is that portion of the phosphorus load believed to be available to generate phytoplankton growth.

However, model simulations suggest a global warming Holocene tendency. This "Holocene temperature conundrum" may be caused by the seasonal bias of paleotemperature proxies. Here we report a quantitative Holocene record with similar to 100-year resolution based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers from an alpine lake in southwestern China. Our reconstructed Holocene temperature record displays a steady long-term trend without distinct cooling or warming changes. Based on the temperature values and their evolution over time, our reconstruction is interpreted to present temperature changes in ice-free seasons from March to November. Unlike the often-documented Holocene cooling of regional summer temperatures driven by boreal summer insolation, this observed trend in our reconstructed temperatures is probably caused by slightly decreasing local ice-free season insolation and somewhat compensated by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Our results demonstrate that the climatic drivers of ice-free season and summer temperature changes could be different and highlight the significance of elucidating the seasonality of proxies before using them for paleoclimate reconstructions. Plain Language Summary Reconstruction of Holocene climate change provides an important basis for understanding long-term climate variability over the last 13.1 kyr and provides context for better projecting future climate change. The gradual Holocene cooling documented by many of the current proxy-based temperature records obviously contradicts the overall warming tendency simulated by climatic models, which limits our understanding of the driving mechanism of Holocene temperature change. Here, we quantitatively reconstruct a Holocene temperature record from an alpine lake in southwestern China. We interpret this record is relation to the ice-free season (March to November) and find that it does not show the distinct cooling or warming trend for the Holocene shown in many previous paleoclimate reconstructions and model simulations. We infer that this observed Holocene temperature trend has been driven by the interplay of subtle declines in local ice-free season insolation and slightly increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. This is quite different from the previously identified Holocene summer cooling driven by a distinct decline in local summer insolation and the Holocene winter warming caused by increasing insolation. This finding suggests the importance of considering the seasonality of proxies before using them for quantitative temperature reconstructions and inferring paleoclimate mechanisms.

The role of environmental parameters in the structure of phytoplankton assemblages and cyanobacteria toxins in two hypereutrophic lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We evaluated the variability of cyanotoxins, water chemistry, and cyanobacteria communities in two hypereutrophic drowned river mouth lakes (Spring Lake and Mona Lake; summer 2006) in west Michigan, USA. Even with considerable geographical and watershed similarity, local variations in nutrient concentrations and environmental factors were found to influence the differences observed in cyanobacteria assemblages and cyanotoxins levels between the two lakes. Limnothrix sp. dominated the phytoplankton community in Spring Lake (82% of biovolume) and was negatively correlated with total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. Although Spring Lake was treated with alum during the previous year, Limnothrix sp. was able to bloom in the lower P environment. In contrast, the N-2-fixing cyanobacterium, Anabaena flos-aquae, dominated the phytoplankton in Mona Lake (64% of biovolume). N-2-fixing cyanobacteria dominance in Mona Lake was correlated with higher TP lower dissolved nitrogen levels. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was found in both systems; however, the toxin-producing polyketide synthetase gene was not present in either population. The higher TP in Mona Lake appeared to account for the 3-fold increase in cyanobacteria biovolume. Restoration plans for both lakes should include assessments of internal loading and continued phytoplankton monitoring to track the temporal distribution of cyanobacteria species and cyanotoxin concentrations.

The stream water had low concentrations of ions, nutrients and organic matter (DOM, POM). The stream had intermittent flow. In the spring, when the water started flowing, the initial communities were composed of organisms adapted to surviving the freezing period such as, blue-green algae Chamaesiphon polonicus (ROSTAFINSKI) HANSGIRG, Diptera: Simuliidae, Chironomidae Diamesa. The main food source was particulate organic matter (POM) carried out from the lake. In the summer, development of attached algae (green algae Klebsormidium rivulare (KUTZ.)

The dominant forest types were aspen-black cherry and mixed oak. The management area was divided into two sections, one which was managed with a short-rotation clearcutting scheme and one that was left unmanaged. Breeding season and summer home ranges of male ruffed grouse were similar to those observed in the Midwest (5.0-9.4 ha), and did not appear to differ between managed and unmanaged habitats. However, habitats used differed between the managed and unmanaged areas. Male grouse on the managed area used aspen-black cherry and mixed oak sapling stands more than expected during both the breeding season and summer. Pole-sized and sawtimber aspen stands in the unmanaged area were used more than expected during breeding and summer seasons. Male ruffed grouse avoided mixed oak sawtimber stands, which comprised 62% and 47% of the available habitat in the unmanaged area and managed area, respectively. Our results demonstrated that southern mixed oak stands can be managed effectively for ruffed grouse with small (1 ha) clearcuts.

These changes also have an impact on human's life. We can know that the average annual temperature in the Dianchi Lake Basin has shown an upward trend in the past 20 years through the analysis of temperature changes in the Dianchi Lake Basin. In the four seasons, there are various degrees of sudden changes, especially in autumn, the temperature rising trend is the most significant, and there is a downward trend in winter but the downward trend is not obvious. From the analysis of monthly average temperature data, it can be seen that the temperature is rising except for April and August, and the rising trend is also obvious in October, November and December.					李, 可欣/IAP-2948-2023														1755-1307						2021	658								012011	10.1088/1755-1315/658/1/012011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/658/1/012011													WOS:000685506000011

Aquatic macrophytes are abundant because of water level stabilization and increased nutrient loads. The influence of plants on flow modification is very important and must be considered in order to simulate hydrodynamic conditions. The spatial distribution of plant species is linked to their instream flow preferences. Several abiotic variables are of importance: Light penetration, wave energy, current velocity, nutrients in substrate and physical characteristics of the substrate are controlling the species and their biomass. Field characterization of macrophytes was performed using echosounder transects in association with a submersible video camera. This technique allowed the calibration of each echofacies for species identification and their relative proportion, height and density. The main eleven assemblages appear to be strongly correlated with abiotic conditions. A basic interpretation key was set up in order to describe plant distribution over the entire lake. Species, relative proportion, density and plant height were interpolated between transects. This information is used to adjust the Manning's friction coefficient for each assemblage. Simulations of the flow fields with plants and in absence of plants show a contrasted pattern. During the summer (with plants), the flow is mainly concentrated in deep channels where velocities are clearly increased by approximately 20% compared to spring-fall simulation (without plants).																			0022-1686						2000	38	3					163	172		10.1080/00221680009498334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00221680009498334													WOS:000088178500001

Potential direct and indirect effects of climate change on a shallow natural lake fish assemblage	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Much uncertainty exists around how fish communities in shallow lakes will respond to climate change. In this study, we modelled the effects of increased water temperatures on consumption and growth rates of two piscivores (northern pike [Esox lucius] and largemouth bass [Micropterus salmoides]) and examined relative effects of consumption by these predators on two prey species (bluegill [Lepomis macrochirus] and yellow perch [Perca flavescens]). Bioenergetics models were used to simulate the effects of climate change on growth and food consumption using predicted 2040 and 2060 temperatures in a shallow Nebraska Sandhill lake, USA. The patterns and magnitude of daily and cumulative consumption during the growing season (April-October) were generally similar between the two predators. However, growth of northern pike was always reduced (-3 to -45% change) compared to largemouth bass that experienced subtle changes (4 to -6% change) in weight by the end of the growing season. Assuming similar population size structure and numbers of predators in 2040-2060, futureconsumption of bluegill and yellow perch by northern pike and largemouth bass will likely increase (range: 3-24%), necessitating greater prey biomass to meet future energy demands. The timing of increased predator consumption will likely shift towards spring and fall (compared to summer), when prey species may not be available in the quantities required. Our findings suggest that increased water temperatures may affect species at the edge of their native range (i.e. northern pike) and a potential mismatch between predator and prey could exist.					; Willis, David/D-3400-2009; Kaemingk, Mark/Q-2191-2019	Krause, Jacob/0000-0002-9804-2481; Kaemingk, Mark/0000-0001-9588-4563; Paukert, Craig/0000-0002-9369-8545; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2016	25	3					487	499		10.1111/eff.12248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12248													WOS:000378625100014
J	Ludovisi, A; Gaino, E				Ludovisi, Alessandro; Gaino, Elda			Meteorological and water quality changes in Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, Italy) during the last fifty years	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												This paper illustrates the results of an analysis performed on historical data of the main meteorological and water quality variables collected during the last fifty years in the basin of Lake Trasimeno, a shallow lake subjected to important water level fluctuations. The results reveal a significant increase of the annual mean of minimum and maximum air temperature, water temperature and solar radiation, and a significant reduction of precipitation and cloud cover, which have mostly occurred during the last twenty years. the decadal rate of warming observed in the last twenty years for air temperature (0.33 degrees C decade(-1)) is consistent with the estimate reported by the IPCC for the land-surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the surface water temperature in Lake Trasimeno shows a more marked increase (0.65 degrees C decade(-1)), comparable to that observed in other lakes of Mediterranean areas. On a monthly scale, the most significant variations are observed in late-spring and early summer months for temperature and solar irradiation, and in winter and spring months for rainfall, which result in an appreciable modification of the seasonal progression. The alterations of the thermal and hydrological balance of the lake have caused a progressive lowering of the water level and the emergence of evaporative conditions. As a consequence of the drought, a progressive accumulation of dissolved slats (3.5 10(6) kg y(-1)) is observed, which is partially explained by meteoric loading. The analysis also shows that an increase in the total alkalinity has occurred during the main drought phases of the last forty years, which has been shown to be consistent with what expected on the basis of the changes in the ionic composition of the waters. With decreasing water levels, a strong reduction in water transparency has also been observed, which does not appear to be connected with a change in the trophic state of the lake, but rather with the increase of suspended solids from bottom sediments, in agreement with the predictions based on resuspesion models in shallow waters. On putting the results into the future scenario of climate change, and accelerating drought and progressive worsening of the water quality can be predicted for Lake Trasimeno in the near future.

A 1,075-cm-long sediment core was recovered from the southeastern part of the lake, from a water depth of 105 m. The core was investigated using geophysical, granulometric, biogeochemical, diatom, ostracod, and pollen analyses. Tephrochronology and AMS radiocarbon dating of plant macrofossils reveals that the sediment sequence spans the past ca. 39,500 years and features a hiatus between ca. 14,600 and 9,400 cal. year BP. The Pleistocene sequence indicates relatively stable and cold conditions, with steppe vegetation in the catchment, at least partial winter ice-cover of the lake, and oxygenated bottom waters at the coring site. The Holocene sequence indicates that the catchment vegetation had changed to forest dominated by pine and summer-green oak. Several of the proxies suggest the impact of abrupt climate oscillations such as the 8.2 or 4.0 ka event. The observed changes, however, cannot be related clearly to a change in temperature or humidity. Human impact started about 5,000 cal. year BP and increased significantly during the past 2,400 years. Water column mixing conditions, inflow from subaquatic springs, and human impact are the most important parameters influencing internal lake processes, notably affecting the composition and characteristics of the sediments.					; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Sulpizio, Roberto/S-2133-2019; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Di Vito, Mauro/MEQ-2109-2025	Zanchetta, Giovanni/0000-0002-7080-9599; Sulpizio, Roberto/0000-0002-3930-5421; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809; Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Valsecchi, Verushka/0000-0001-8271-2826; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2009	41	3					407	430		10.1007/s10933-008-9234-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9234-2													WOS:000263543300002

Macroinvertebrate communities in two Norwegian glacial rivers, one in the western fjords (Dalelva) and one in the eastern mountains (Leirungsai), were investigated during three time periods in 1996 and 1997. 2. Channel stability variables (substratum heterogeneity/Pfankuch index/hydraulic stress) and water temperature accounted for 54% of the total inertia in the principal components analysis (PCA) ordination of environmental variables. The importance of these variables was confirmed by cluster analysis. 3. The two rivers were well separated in the ordinations, with Leirungsai showing much greater heterogeneity. This is explained by differences in altitudinal range, terrestrial vegetation and the importance and nature of tributary inputs. 4. Channel stability and temperature were also important in determining faunal communities in the two glacial rivers, supporting the main determining variables in the conceptual model of glacial streams (Milner & Petts, 1994). However, clear temporal differences were apparent in the data, the two rivers being more similar during the summer period of high discharge dominated by glacial meltwater. During spring and especially during autumn environmental conditions and the macroinvertebrate fauna differed both within and between rivers. 5. Diamesinae dominated in the upper reaches of both rivers, with Orthocladiinae becoming more common downstream. The dominance of Diamesinae persisted further down Dalelva because of the continued influence of glacial tributaries, whereas in Leirungsai the influence of non-glacial tributaries led to a change towards a greater proportion of Orthocladiinae. Lakes modified macroinvertebrate communities in both river systems.					; Castella, Emmanuel/K-6680-2019	CASTELLA, Emmanuel/0000-0002-4115-4124; 													0046-5070					DEC	2001	46	12					1723	1736		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00854.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00854.x													WOS:000172985200011

We present an original 18S rDNA survey of freshwater picoeukaryotes sampled during spring/summer 2005, complementing an earlier study conducted in autumn 2004 in Lake Pavin (France). These studies were designed to detect the small unidentified heterotrophic flagellates (HF, 0.6-5 mu m) which are considered the main bacterivores in aquatic systems. Alveolates, Fungi and Stramenopiles represented 65% of the total diversity and differed from the dominant groups known from microscopic studies. Fungi and Telonemia taxa were restricted to the oxic zone which displayed two fold more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) than the oxycline. Temporal forcing also appeared as a driving force in the diversification within targeted organisms. Several sequences were not similar to those in databases and were considered as new or unsampled taxa, some of which may be typical of freshwater environments. Two taxa known from marine systems, the genera Telonema and Amoebophrya, were retrieved for the first time in our freshwater study. The analysis of potential trophic strategies displayed among the targeted HF highlighted the dominance of parasites and saprotrophs, and provided indications that these organisms have probably been wrongfully regarded as bacterivores in previous studies. A theoretical exercise based on a new 'parasite/saprotroph-dominated HF hypothesis' demonstrates that the inclusion of parasites and saprotrophs may increase the functional role of the microbial loop as a link for carbon flows in pelagic ecosystems. New interesting perspectives in aquatic microbial ecology are thus opened.

Seasonal changes in the somatic indices of the freshwater silverside, Odontesthes bonariensis (Teleostei, Atheriniformes) from a Neotropical shallow lake (Argentina)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The study object was an Odontesthes bonariensis (Valenciennes, 1835) population of a characteristically shallow lake from the pampasic region. Over one year, zooplankton and fish samples were collected monthly. As a function of time and gender, several indices were investigated (relative weight, mesentery fat index, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index and somatic index) and were related to zooplanktonic community dynamics, the main energy food source for this species. The results indicate that the seasonal information contained in the weight compartments is most important in mesentery fat, gonads and liver. The zooplankton availability modulates reserves (fat) behaviour and physiologic activity (liver), determining spawn intensity. Thus, in spring spawns, with higher zooplankton availability, mature individuals of the population, males and females, transfer energy from the food to the gonads. In autumn spawns, they use the fat reserves for gonad ripening.					; Colautti, Darío/AAV-4732-2020	Maronas, Miriam E./0000-0001-5324-2079; Colautti, Dario/0000-0002-8896-4255													1519-6984	1678-4375				MAY	2009	69	2					389	395		10.1590/S1519-69842009000200023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-69842009000200023								19675944					WOS:000268140300022

Counts were made in late summer and early fall. Three species, red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), and Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsoni) were the most plentiful. None of these hawks showed any strong increasing or decreasing trend in numbers over the 20-yr survey period, but all three showed a large increase in numbers subsequent to the end of a drought in 1977. We suggest that in some cases, a small number of counts may provide useful data, and that counts in different locations might provide information on migratory strategies of adults and juveniles.																			0892-1016					JUN	1995	29	2					99	102																WOS:A1995RG91900003

To discriminate between the alternative models, we calculate variations in sediment yield within a high-resolution stratigraphic framework developed for the Alkyonides basin, central Greece. Latest Quaternary highstand deposits are distinguished from lowstand Lake Corinth deposits on the basis of seismic reflection data and micropaleontological and palynological analyses of drop cores. After depth conversion and calculation of solid sediment masses in successive time slices, sediment discharge rates during the last glacial lowstand interval (ca. 70-12 ka) are shown to have exceeded discharge rates during the preceding interglacial highstand interval (ca. 128-70 ka) by greater than or equal to 60%, implying enhanced seasonality during the glacial period, with cool, dry summer and wet winter conditions in the region. Sediment yield calculations can thus provide an empirical test of paleoclimate models and offer input to sequence stratigraphic models.

BP section of the sediments of a small lake in southern Finland was studied by high-resolution pollen and cladoceran analyses to examine the response of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to the 8200 cal. yr BP cold event. Furthermore, a pollen-based T-ann reconstruction and proportions of chydorid ephippia were used to determine changes in temperature and in the length of open-water season during the event. The pollen data, with abrupt decreases of the early-flowering Alnus, Corylus and Ulmus at c. 8350 cal. yr BP, may partly reflect vegetation dynamics but possibly also decreased pollen productivity and reproduction caused by cold winters and springs. The reconstructed 7 nn indicated a rapid temperature fall and a subsequent recovery. Proportions of chydorid ephippia suggested a considerable reduction in the length of open-water season at the beginning of the event, followed by periodically shorter open-water seasons. In the aquatic ecosystem only one species, the dominant planktonic cladoceran Bosmina longirostris, responded by decreasing dramatically and almost became extinct during the coldest period. However, we were unable to reconstruct the causative link between the inferred climate change and its decrease. The response of both aquatic and terrestrial proxies at c. 8350 cal. yr BP was consistent, indicating an abrupt start of the event and also an abrupt end at c. 8100 cal. yr BP.

Manganese oxide formed in the water column was identified as H+-birnessite offering a large amount of vacancies in the birnessite layers for cation sorption. EXAFS spectroscopy reveals reduced manganese in the top 2 mm of the sediment. Therefore, the reduction of MnO2 must occur at similar rates as the sedimentation which is 2.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1) during summer. EXAFS-spectroscopy and microprobe analyses show that Mn is associated with authigenic (Ca,Mn)CO3 and (Fe,Mn)(3)(PO4)(2)*8H(2)O-particles. The relative amount of Mn in these two phases was quantitatively determined by EXAFS spectroscopy, yielding 55-60% Mn incorporated in carbonate and 40-45% Mn in phosphate particles. The average concentration of Mn amounts to 23 mol% in carbonate particles and 16 mol% in phosphate. With respect to the solid solutions, (Ca,Mn)CO3 and (Fe,Mn)(3)(PO4)(2)*H2O, the porewater remains oversaturated from spring until autumn. Thus, dissolution of these phases is very unlikely. The remobilisation of Mn from the sediment into the deep water is, therefore, thought to be governed by other processes such as adsorption and desorption of Mn(II) on calcite surfaces.

The only nongame waterbirds observed attempting to nest in 2004 were black terns (Chlidonias niger), but they failed to hatch any young. We recorded 246 Western grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis) on Lake Christina in the spring of 2004, but by mid-June most had left the lake. During this period, few fish were available, and we suggest that although the emergent vegetation was suitable for nesting, the lack of food prevented colony formation. In spring 2005, small fish were again available on the lake, and numbers of all nongame species were greater than in 2004. We located 315 western grebe nests, of which 198 hatched >= 1 young (63% of all attempts). Landscape-level manipulation may enhance habitat for some species but also has the potential to exclude trophic levels from future use and should be considered when manipulating large-scale systems.																			0022-541X					JUN	2007	71	4					1158	1162		10.2193/2006-364	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2006-364													WOS:000247168500018

Primary production of plankton and decomposition of organic matter in saline lakes of the crimea peninsula	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The lakes under study can be classified as eutrophic-hypertrophic waterbodies according to the level of primary production. High concentrations of suspended matter (up to 7326 g/m(3)) and total phosphorus (up to 5625 mg/m(3)) were registered in the lakes. The values of the primary production of plankton and the destruction of organic matter do not depend on the absolute concentration of salts in water. Unlike the destruction of organic matter, the primary production of plankton is higher in winter than in summer. Thus, the accumulation of organic matter in saline lakes occurs mainly in winter. The negative relationship between the primary production of plankton and the biomass of the filter feeder Artemia sp. has been determined.

Over a 3-yr period, lake-atmosphere exchanges of CO2 were measured over 5 weeks in spring, summer, and fall. Observed springtime CO2 efflux was large (2.3-2.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) immediately after lake-thaw. That efflux decreased exponentially with time to less than 0.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) within 2 weeks. Substantial interannual variability was found in the magnitudes of springtime efflux, surface water CO2 concentrations, lake CO2 storage, and meteorological conditions. Summertime measurements show a weak diurnal trend with a small average downward flux (-0.17 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) to the lake's surface, while late fall Bur was trendless and smaller (-0.0021 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Large springtime efflux afforded an opportunity to make direct measurement of lake-atmosphere fluxes well above the detection limits of eddy covariance instruments, facilitating the testing of different gas flux methodologies and air-water gas-transfer models. Although there was an overall agreement in fluxes determined by eddy covariance and those calculated from lake-water storage change in CO2, agreement was inconsistent between eddy covariance flux measurements and fluxes predicted by boundary-layer and surface-renewal models. Comparison of measured and modeled transfer velocities for CO2, along with measured and modeled cumulative CO2 flux, indicates that in most instances the surface-renewal model underpredicts actual flux. Greater underestimates were found with comparisons involving homogeneous boundary-layer models. No physical mechanism responsible for the inconsistencies was identified by analyzing coincidentally measured environmental variables.

J	Fürsich, FT; Sha, JG; Jiang, BY; Pan, YH				Fuersich, Franz Theodor; Sha, Jingeng; Jiang, Baoyu; Pan, Yanhong			High resolution palaeoecological and taphonomic analysis of Early Cretaceous lake biota, western Liaoning (NE-China)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The faunal content of eighteen bedding planes within the Jianshangou Unit of the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of western Liaoning has been analysed in detail in order to understand the environmental and taphonomic framework of this famous lacustrine fossillagerstatte. The bedding planes were excavated within a 3 m thick section, which is composed of laminated mudstones, graded sandstones and mudstones, and horizontally stratified structureless sandstones and tuffs. All investigated bedding planes occur within the laminated mudstone facies and contain elements of the so-called Jehol Biota, in particular the conchostracan Eosestheria ovata, the ephemerid nymph Hexagenites trisetalis and the crustacean Liaoningogriphus quadripartitus. These three faunal elements occur in high abundance, originally possessed chitinous skeletons and are preserved as compressed, faintly mineralized coats or, in the case of Eosestheria, still possess organic material. The specimens do no represent exuviae, but body fossils. The fossils can be grouped into three low diversity associations, each characterized by one of the three taxa. The plan-view orientation of the taxa is invariably random and size frequency histograms are bimodal or polymodal. This indicates that the fauna is autochthonous and that the histograms reflect several recruitment phases. Apparently, the faunal elements suffered seasonal mass mortality caused by anoxic conditions, which became established in the lake during the summer months. Increased humidity during the winter led to mixing of the lake waters, re-establishment of oxic conditions and to deposition of a thin film of sediment. Such environmental conditions were episodically interrupted by flash floods and volcanic ash falls, which may have been responsible for the preservation of the more spectacular elements of the Jehol biota such as birds and feathered dinosaurs.

Vegetation and climate dynamics during the Holocene and Eemian interglacials derived from Lake Baikal pollen records	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The last interglacial (LI) and Holocene changes in annual precipitation (P-ann), the mean temperature of the warmest (T-w) and coldest (T-c) month and the moisture index (alpha) were reconstructed from continuous pollen records from Lake Baikal. The Holocene core (52 degrees 3'N, 106 degrees 09'E) presented in this study was recovered from a depth of 355 m in the 25-km wide underwater Buguldeika saddle separating the southern sub-basin of Lake Baikal from its central sub-basin. The biome reconstruction shows that tundra and steppe biomes have highest scores during ca. 15,000-13,300 cal. years B.P. and that taiga becomes a dominant vegetation type after ca. 13,300 cal. years B.P. Our quantitative reconstruction indicates an onset of relatively warm and wet conditions soon after ca. 10,000 cal. years B.P. The warmest and wettest climate with T-w similar to 16 degrees C, P-ann similar to 480 mm and alpha similar to 0.9-1 has been reconstructed for ca. 9000-7000 cal. years B.P. In the Lake Baikal region this interval is characterized by the appearance and spread of hunter communities (Kitoi culture). Consistently a hiatus in the regional archaeological record (4900-4200 years B.C. or 6850-6150 cal. years B.P.) coincides with the interval of a major climate deterioration which followed the 'climatic optimum'. An attempt to find a relationship between the archaeological record and a spread of steppe and meadow communities in the Lake Baikal region demonstrates that despite a long habitation of the area the human impact on vegetation was local rather than regional and likely did not affect the pollen record from Lake Baikal. The reconstructed peaks in the steppe biome scores during the last 9000 years are consistent with short (one to five hundred year) episodes of weak Pacific (summer) monsoon supporting our interpretation that the Holocene vegetation changes around Lake Baikal are associated with large-scale circulation processes controlling regional water balance rather than with human activities. Thus, our study proves the suitability of Lake Baikal pollen data for the reconstruction of natural vegetation and climate dynamics through the whole period from the onset of the LI to the present. Comparison of the recent and the last interglacial suggests that the Holocene 'climatic optimum' was less pronounced (e.g. lower summer and winter temperatures and annual precipitation sums) than that of the LI On the other hand, pollen records demonstrate that the Holocene 'forest phase' already lasts some thousand years longer than that of the LI. The interglacial vegetation dynamics derived from the Lake Baikal pollen records can be satisfactorily explained by reconstructed changes in summer and winter temperatures and in available moisture. The interglacial vegetation around Lake Baikal is dominated by the boreal forests, which are associated with a generally warm and wet climate. The high sea level associated with decreased ice volume appears to have had a greater impact on the Siberian environments during the last and the recent interglacial than the direct effect of lower-than-present winter insolation. Reconstructed changes in the winter temperature correlate well with changes in the sea level and global ice volume, while the summer temperatures derived from the Lake Baikal pollen records track changes in the summer insolation.

J	Wright, JR; Powell, LL; Tonra, CM				Wright, James R.; Powell, Luke L.; Tonra, Christopher M.			Automated telemetry reveals staging behavior in a declining migratory passerine	AUK												Migratory birds spend most of their journeys at stopover sites where they rest and refuel. Many migrants are in steep decline, and understanding their behavior within and among migrations is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies across the full annual cycle. One of the most rapidly declining songbirds in North America is the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus; 85-95% decline over the past 50 yr), and stopover ecology is a major gap in our knowledge of its annual cycle. We utilized an automated telemetry array in western Lake Erie and the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to track landscape-scale movements, stopover duration, departure behavior, and between-season site fidelity in this species. We found that stopover duration during both fall and spring was nearly 1 mo (mean=25.5 days)-exceptionally long for a passerine. During spring, birds in both poor condition and high degree of molt had longer stopovers, post-departure flights were relatively long for a songbird, and tailwinds predicted departure in both seasons. Many individuals made landscape-scale (10-35 km) relocations during stopover. Site fidelity was high for a passerine, in terms of both route and stopover site. Taken together, these behaviors describe a migration strategy that largely matches the staging behavior of shorebirds. Lastly, we found that Rusty Blackbirds migrate directly across Lake Erie and migrate primarily at night, which might expose them to mortality from offshore wind development. Collectively, our results indicate that high-quality stopover habitat may be critically important to Rusty Blackbird populations. More broadly, our results highlight the need to expand the scale of stopover studies, and to further explore all aspects of species' annual cycles to understand potential limiting factors on populations.					; Tonra, Christopher/B-1620-2013	Powell, Luke/0000-0002-2001-4982; 														1938-4254				JUL	2018	135	3					461	476		10.1642/AUK-17-219.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-17-219.1													WOS:000436501100007
J	WARNER, K				WARNER, K			POPULATION AND FISHERY CHARACTERISTICS OF LANDLOCKED SALMON IN A SMALL MAINE LAKE	PROGRESSIVE FISH-CULTURIST												Hatchery-reared landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were stocked annually (1972-1975) in a 24.7 ha lake to provide a sport fishery. Three year classes of salmon were sampled by angling and trap netting in spring and fall, 1973-1976. Population estimates showed relatively poor survival (6.2-18.0%) of all 3 yr classes during their 1st yr. Anglers caught 18.9% of jaw-tagged salmon of the 1971 year class. Spring catch per hour and estimated mean population size were significantly related (P < 0.05). The poor initial survival of hatchery-reared salmon, their high vulnerability to angling, and the expense of the hatchery product make it doubtful that salmon management in ponds of similar size and characteristics can be justified.																			0033-0779						1978	40	2					56	58		10.1577/1548-8659(1978)40[56:PAFCOL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1978)40[56:PAFCOL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1978EZ88900005

Long-term change in the phenology of spring phytoplankton: species-specific responses to nutrient enrichment and climatic change	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. A number of studies have shown that spring biological events have advanced in recent decades, and concluded that these changes in phenology are driven by climatic change. Freshwater lakes are sensitive indicators of climate change, where direct effects of climate on physical processes can affect the seasonal timing of planktonic communities. However, many lake ecosystems have also experienced long-term changes in other ecological pressures that could affect phenology. 2. In this study, long-term (1955-2003) physical, chemical and biological data from Windermere (UK) were analysed in order to assess the relative effects of a number of coincident pressures on the phenology of two spring diatom taxa. The analysis provides a detailed case study, highlighting the species-specific drivers that affect the phenology of dominant members of the phytoplankton community. 3. The results showed that, whilst the spring peak biomass of one taxon (Cyclotella) appeared to be advancing as a result of earlier thermal stratification, the advancement of the other (Asterionella) was closely linked with both progressive nutrient enrichment and lake warming. Furthermore, nutrient enrichment explained more variation in phenology than water temperature. Both taxa also reached their peak abundance earlier when the over wintering biomass at the end of the previous year was higher. 4. Patterns of change in phenology and ecological pressures were markedly nonlinear in time, as were the effects of some drivers of seasonal timing. This highlighted a need to relax the restriction of linearity in our analyses of biological seasonality. 5. Synthesis. Phenological shifts may be brought about by local processes, such as eutrophication, as well as by climate change. Even in the same ecosystem different mechanisms may alter the phenology of different species.

The results obtained show that the copepod has a marked physiological property of tolerance to low temperature and high salinity, and this property could be strengthened after winter. The response to different temperature and salinity of the copepod evidently expressed the tardy characteristics contrasted with seasons. This means that for a long germ in early winter (lower temperature and higher salinity) the animal still has higher tolerance to lower salinity and higher temperature; and it is opposite in early summer. These physiological features are possibly caused by natural acclimatization in the lake. The experimental data were processed and plotted by computer. The correlation of animal''s survival rate with the changes of temperature and salinity presented an approximately smooth surface of a three-degree elliptic sphere.																			1006-9291					JUL	1990	33	7					801	809																WOS:A1990DR88500005

Modern observations reveal that the delta O-18 in precipitation is an integrated tracer of the atmospheric processes of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), and the westerlies, which dominate the climate of the Tibetan Plateau. Here, we summarize and compare 20 Holocene lacustrine authigenic carbonate delta O-18 records from lakes distributed across the Tibetan Plateau. After carefully considering the potential effects of temperature, evaporation, site elevation, meltwater supply, and moisture sources, we eliminate their influences on the isotopic composition of Tibetan lakes, and suggest that the long-term variations of the lacustrine delta O-18 records were dominated by the moisture sources. The delta O-18 values of the lake sediments in the central and western Tibetan Plateau increased since the early Holocene, which agrees with the trend of delta O-18 in speleothem records from the plateau, as well as with the variations of monsoon precipitation reconstructions for the region. Overall, this evidence indicates the substantial influence of the monsoon in the abovementioned regions. However, the delta O-18 records from lakes in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau show a decreasing trend during the second half of the Holocene (after similar to 5 ka), highlighting the operation of a different hydrological process, with enhanced moisture availability, in the regions. It has been suggested that the increased contribution from westerlies-derived moisture in the nonmonsoon season, with depleted delta O-18 (e.g., from melting snow or frozen soil in spring), is responsible for such variations. We propose that the interplay between the Asian summer monsoon and the westerlies was the major control of the hydroclimatic variations on the Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene, which led to the dipolar pattern of moisture variation between the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and other parts of the plateau, on the multi-millennial timescales during the Holocene.					; Zhang, Jiawu/C-8633-2011; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Chen, Jianhui/A-5340-2011; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013	Hillman, Aubrey/0000-0001-8182-5626; Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; 													0012-8252	1872-6828				OCT	2022	233								104169	10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104169		SEP 2022											WOS:000862301100002
J	Custer, CM; Custer, TW				Custer, CM; Custer, TW			Food habits of diving ducks in the Great Lakes after the zebra mussel invasion	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) invaded the Great Lakes in the mid-1980s and quickly reached high densities. The objective of this study was to determine current consumption of zebra mussels by waterfowl in the Great Lakes region. Feeding Lesser Scaups (Aythya affinis), Greater Scaups (A. marila), Canvasbacks (A. valisineria), Redheads (A. americana), Buffleheads (Bucephala albeola) and Common Goldeneyes (B. clangula) were collected in western Lake Erie and in Lake St. Clair between fall and spring, 1992-1993 to determine food habits. All 10 Redheads, 97% of Lesser Scaups, 83% of Goldeneyes, 60% of Buffleheads and 9% of Canvasbacks contained one or more zebra mussels in their upper gastrointestinal tracts. The aggregate percent of zebra mussels in the diet of Lesser Scaups was higher in Lake Erie (98.6%) than in Lake St. Clair (54.4%). Zebra mussels (aggregate percent) dominated the diet of Common Goldeneyes (79.2%) but not in Buffleheads (23.5%), Redheads (21%) or Canvasbacks (9%). Lesser Scaups from Lake Erie fed on larger zebra mussels ((x)over bar> = 10.7 +/- 0.66 mm SE) than did Lesser Scaups from Lake St. Clair (x = 4.4 +/- 0.22 mm). Lesser Scaups, Buffleheads and Common Goldeneyes from Lake Erie consumed zebra mussels of similar size.					; Custer, Christine/H-4871-2014	Custer, Thomas/0000-0003-3170-6519; 													0273-8570	1557-9263				WIN	1996	67	1					86	99																WOS:A1996TR66200010

Pesticide levels in Maskenthine Lake, a small impoundment of 34 ha, increased in response to spring and early summer runoff events. Twelve pesticides [atrazine, 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine; alachlor, 2-chloro-N-(2,6-ethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl)acetamide; metolachlor, 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl) acetamide; cyanazine, 2-[[4-chloro-6-(ethylamino)s-triazin-2-yl] amino]-2-methylpropionitrile; EPTC, S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate; butylate, S-ethyl diisobutylthiocarbamate; propachlor, 2-chloro-N-(1-methylethyl)N-phenylacetamide; trifluralin, alpha,alpha,alpha-trifluoro-2, 6-dinitro-N, N-dipropyl-p-toluidine; simazine, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine; propazine, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine; fonofos, O-ethyl S-phenyl ethylpbosphonodithioate; metribuzin, 4-amino-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl) -3-(methylthio)-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H-one] and two atrazine metabolites, deethylatrazine, 2-amino-4-chloro-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (DEA) and deisopropylatrazine, 2-amino-4-chloro-6-ethylaminostriazine (DIA) were detected. Atrazine, cyanazine, DEA and DIA levels were greater than 1 mug/L. Atrazine remained above the maximum contaminant level for potable water of 3 mug/L throughout the period of investigation. The pesticide response to spring and summer runoff events was much less pronounced at Willow Lake, a 284 ha impoundment. Ten of 12 pesticides and two atrazine metabolites in Maskenthine Lake were also detected in Willow Lake; however, concentrations did not exceed 1 mug/L. After the spring flush of pesticides in May and June, concentrations decreased until the following spring. Ratios of DEA to atrazine and DIA to atrazine remained relatively constant suggesting that appreciable amounts of biodegradates were not produced. Apparent half-lives were calculated from observed concentration decreases that appeared to follow first-order kinetics. Atrazine was the most persistent agrichemical (t1/2 = 193, t1/2 = 124) introduced in the spring runoff events. Extracted pesticide levels were higher in bottom cores from Maskenthine Lake than from Willow Lake. Differences in pesticide levels in the two lakes were related to watershed slope, soil drainage capacity, landuse, and rainfall.

The Color of Earth's Lakes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Although water color is a fundamental property of freshwater ecosystems, the global distribution of lake color remains unknown. Here, we used 5.14 million color records derived from satellite images during 2013-2020 to determine the modal water color of 85,360 representative lakes worldwide. We find that globally, lake modal colors span the visible spectrum with a bimodal distribution of blue versus non-blue (green-brown), with 31% of lakes being blue and 69% being non-blue. Both climate and lake morphology influence lake modal color. Blue lakes are associated with cooler summer air temperature, winter ice cover, and higher precipitation. Under a 3 degrees C increase in summer air temperature, 14% of blue lakes could shift to a non-blue regime, representing a substantial change to their underlying ecology. As lake ecosystems continue to face a range of stressors, this study provides a critical baseline for understanding lake responses to global environmental change.					; O'Reilly, Catherine/AFZ-5813-2022; Ross, Matthew/AAH-5785-2020; Wang, Jida/AGH-0464-2022	Topp, Simon/0000-0001-7741-5982; O'Reilly, Catherine/0000-0001-9685-3697; Wang, Jida/0000-0003-3548-8918; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				SEP 28	2022	49	18							e2022GL098925	10.1029/2022GL098925	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022GL098925													WOS:000859109500001
