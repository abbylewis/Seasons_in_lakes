Seenayya et Subba Raju was examined in a subtropical water reservoir, Lake Samsonvale (=North Pine reservoir). A novel in situ bioassay approach, using dialysis tubing rather than bottles or bags, was used to determine the change in C. raciborskii dominance with daily additions of DIP. A statistically significant increase in dominance of C. raciborskii was observed when DIP was added at two concentrations (0.32 mu M and 16 mu M) in a daily pulse over a 4 d period in three separate experiments in the summer of 2006/2007. There was an increase in both C. raciborskii cell concentrations and biovolume in two DIP treatments, but not in the ammoniacal N + DIP treatment. In addition, overall phytoplankton cell concentrations increased with DIP addition, indicating that Lake Samsonvale was DIP limited at the time of experiments. Given the bioassay response, it is likely that dominance of C. raciborskii could increase in Lake Samsonvale with periodic injections of DIP such as inflow events.

Models that capture the effects of agricultural and conservation practices on soil erosion and sediment delivery can help to address this challenge. Historic records of climatic variability and agricultural change over the last century also offer valuable information for establishing extended baselines against which to evaluate management scenarios. Here, we present an approach that combines centennial-scale reconstructions of climate and agricultural land cover with modelling across four lake catchments in the UK where radiometric dating provides a record of lake sedimentation. We compare simulations using MMF-TWI, a catchment-scale model developed for humid agricultural landscapes that incorporates representation of seasonal variability in vegetation cover, soil water balance, runoff and sediment contributing areas. MMF-TWI produced mean annual sediment exports within 9-20% of sediment core-based records without calibration and using guide parameter values to represent vegetation cover. Simulations of land management scenarios compare upland afforestation and lowland field-scale conservation measures to reconstructed historic baselines. Oak woodland versus conifer afforestation showed similar reductions in mean annual surface runoff (8-16%) compared to current moorland vegetation but a larger reduction in sediment exports (26-46 versus 4-30%). Riparian woodland buffers reduced upland sediment yields by 15-41%, depending on understorey cover levels, but had only minor effect on surface runoff. Planting of winter cover crops in the lowland arable catchment halved historic sediment exports. Permanent grass margins applied to sets of arable fields across 15% or more of the catchment led to further significant reduction in exports. Our findings show the potential for reducing sediment delivery at the catchment scale with land management interventions. We also demonstrate how MMF-TWI can support hydrologically-informed decision making to better target conservation measures in humid agricultural environments.

J	Lafontaine-Boyer, K; Gajewski, K				Lafontaine-Boyer, Karelle; Gajewski, Konrad			Vegetation dynamics in relation to late Holocene climate variability and disturbance, Outaouais, Quebec, Canada	HOLOCENE												A pollen diagram from Lac Brule in southwestern Quebec (45 degrees 4309N, 75 degrees 2632W, 270m) provides a late Holocene history of the vegetation. The presence of varved sediments permitted the development of a high-resolution (10-year), cross-dated chronology with an estimated error of approximately 1%. During the last 1400years, the forests were dominated by Tsuga, Fagus, Betula, Acer and Pinus. A peak in microcharcoal and evidence of post-fire succession suggest that the changes in the pollen assemblages around ad1375 were a consequence of a fire in the region. There was a decrease in pollen influx of several deciduous taxa and Tsuga between ad1600 and 1700, suggesting a rapid climate change that was significant enough to have affected pollen production of these taxa. This change, associated with the beginning of the Little Ice Age' in the region, affected the forest composition for the subsequent centuries. A detailed comparison of this pollen record with that from a nearby pollen diagram also prepared at high-temporal resolution shows the ability of pollen records to record short-period climate variations and disturbances.

A general approach to automatic measurements of water velocity	MATERIALS TESTING												Real-time measurement of river flow velocity below the ice in winter is a tough problem. An experimental apparatus of a new thrust flow transducer based on the properties of particle phase is proposed in this paper. The traction cable's pull force which is given by the floating ball in the fluid can be measured by the experimental apparatus. Then the force values of the rigid floating ball are used to calculate fluid thrust on the floating ball. Finally, the velocity can be evaluated by an empirical formula between the fluid velocity and fluid thrust on the floating ball. Such a new thrust flow transducer is simple and requires only low costs. It can not only be used for measuring the surface velocity of rivers, water channels, lakes, and oceans, but can also be used for automatic measuring the velocity of water including frazil slush which is found below the ice sheets of rivers, water channels, lakes, and oceans in freezing conditions.																			0025-5300						2013	55	7-8					593	597		10.3139/120.110472	http://dx.doi.org/10.3139/120.110472													WOS:000323591900012

The average lifespan of Cambarus-robustus was found to be three years, with reproduction occurring at the end of the third summer. Breeding males (form I) had an average carapace length of 30.6 mm with measurements ranging from 23.4 mm to 41.9 mm in length. Ovigerous females appeared at the end of June and July and the average number of eggs produced was 61.1. Mature females had an average carapace length of 29.7 mm with measurements ranging from 224.3 mm to 34.3 mm in length. The Cambarus-robustus specimens found in the Eramosa-Speed river system were less fertile, smaller in size, and had a shorter lifespan than those observed in the Kawartha Lakes region by Hamr and Berrill.																			0011-216X	1568-5403				NOV	1990	59		3				225	230		10.1163/156854090X00417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854090X00417													WOS:A1990EH35300001

It demonstrates that sub-cloud evaporation during precipitation and continental moisture recycling are local, respectively, regional processes controlling these variations. In general, sub-cloud evaporation decreases and moisture recycling increases the d-excess. Therefore, evaluation of d-excess variations in terms of moisture recycling, the main aim of this paper, includes determination of the effect of sub-cloud evaporation. Since sub-cloud evaporation is governed by saturation deficit and distance between cloud base and the ground, its effect on the d-excess is expected to be lower at mountain than at lowland/valley stations. To determine quantitatively this difference, we examined long-term seasonal d-excess variations measured at three selected mountain and adjoining valley stations. The altitude differences between mountain and valley stations ranged from 470 to 1665 m. Adapting the 'falling water drop' model by Stewart [J. Geophys. Res., 80(9), 1133-1146 (1975).], we estimated that the long-term average of sub-cloud evaporation at the selected mountain stations (altitudes between about 1600 and 2250 m.a.s.l.) is less than 1% of the precipitation and causes a decrease of the d-excess of less than 2. For the selected valley stations, the corresponding evaporated fraction is at maximum 7% and the difference in d-excess ranges up to 8. The estimated d-excess differences have been used to correct the measured long-term d-excess values at the selected stations. Finally, the corresponding fraction of water vapour has been estimated that recycled by evaporation of surface water including soil water from the ground. For the two mountain stations Patscherkofel and Feuerkogel, which are located north of the main ridge of the Alps, the maximum seasonal change of the corrected d-excess (July/August) has been estimated to be between 5 and 6, and the corresponding recycled fraction between 2.5-3% of the local precipitation. It has been found that the estimated recycled fractions are in good agreement with values derived from other approaches.																			1025-6016						2008	44	1					61	70		10.1080/10256010801887208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256010801887208								18320428					WOS:000253731000007

Morphological and phylogenetic diversity of bacteria and archaea as well as data from routine total bacterial cell counts are summarized. From 2001 to 2011, there was a definite, significant trend to lower the annual average cell counts that coincided with a significant decrease in bacterial productivity. Additional information is provided on anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria prevailing in Lake Kinneret. The most abundant of these phototrophs is the green sulfur bacterium (GSB) Chlorobium phaeobacteroides Pfennig. It forms (almost consistently) a prominent layer in the metalimnion from June through October. The spatial distribution of BChl e, an indicator of C. phaeobacteroides, was fairly heterogeneous, and its peak values often exceeded the record of chlorophyll a peaks. C. phaeobacteroides was identified as a major contributor to the sedimenting material in the lake in the summer, making up on average 27 % of the carbon settling towards the bottom.

Both the pelagic and benthic net dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) productions were measured in situ on four occasions from June to September 2004, in the unproductive Lake Diktar-Erik in subarctic Sweden. The stable isotopic signal (delta C-13) of respired organic material was estimated from hypolimnion water data and data from a laboratory incubation using epilimnion water. 2. Both pelagic and benthic habitats were net heterotrophic during the study period, with a total net DIC production of 416 mg C m(-2) day(-1), of which the pelagic habitat contributed approximately 85%. The net DIC production decreased with depth both in the pelagic water and in the sediments, and most of the net DIC production occurred in the upper water column. 3. Temporal variations in both pelagic and benthic DIC production were small, although we observed a significant decrease in pelagic net DIC production after the autumn turnover. Water temperature was the single most important factor explaining temporal and vertical variations in pelagic DIC production. No single factor explained more than 10% of the benthic net DIC production, which probably was regulated by several interacting factors. 4. Pelagic DIC production, and thus most of the whole-lake net production of DIC, was mainly due to the respiration of allochthonous organic carbon. Stable isotope data inferred that nearly 100% of accumulated DIC in the hypolimnion water had an allochthonous carbon source. Similarly, in the laboratory incubation using epilimnion water, c. 85% of accumulated DIC was indicated to have an allochthonous organic carbon source.																			0046-5070					MAR	2007	52	3					549	560		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01725.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01725.x													WOS:000244111400014

This species has a peculiar biology, often occurring in small springs, stagnant and underground waters. Body form and small scales indicate specialisation to karstic environment. Ten years ago some authors identified C. phoxinus as the most abundant species in the natural Lake Busko blato in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which belongs to the same Cetina watershed. In Croatia, the species occurs only in Sinjsko polje and is very rare despite the fact that the area of main occurrence is very close. In major investigations of the Croatian distribution area, within the Cetina river system, C. phoxinus was nor registered. Introductions of alien species, especially the invasive ones from the Danube watershed, such as Lepomis gibbosus, Ictalurus nebulosus, Pseudorasbara parva, and Carassius auratus gibelio greatly jeopardise its survival. Recently, natural habitats of C. phoxinus described previously with only twelve species, have completely disappeared.																			0139-7893						1998	47	1					39	43																WOS:000073914300006

Spatial variations in tap water isotopes across Canada: Tracing water from precipitation to distribution and assess regional water resources	PLOS WATER												With global warming and increasing water use, tap water resources need sustainable management. We used hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses in tap water (i.e., 52H and 518O values) to identify issues associated with tap water resources in Canada. We analyzed 576 summer tap samples collected from across Canada and 76 tap samples from three cities during different seasons and years. We classified the samples based on their sources: groundwater (TapGroundwater), river (TapRiver) and lake (TapLake). 52H values in tap water correlate strongly with values predicted for local precipitation across Canada with a stronger correlation for TapGroundwater and TapRiver than for TapLake. We then constructed water balance models to predict the 52H of surface water across Canada, and validated them against Canadian stream 52H data. 52H values in tap water correlate strongly with values predicted for local surface water, however, the water balance models improved the predictability only for TapRiver and TapLake and not for TapGroundwater. TapGroundwater 52H values reflect the 52H values of annually averaged precipitation, whereas TapRiver and TapLake 52H values reflect post-precipitation processes. We used the 52H residuals between the observed and predicted 52H values to assess regional processes influencing tap water 52H values across Canada. Regionally, snow/glacier melt contributes to all tap sources around the Rockies. Tap waters are highly evaporated across Western Canada, irrespective of their sources. In the Great Lakes and East Coast regions, tap waters are evaporated in many localities, particularly those using surface reservoirs and lakes. We propose the use of these isotopic baselines as a way forward for the monitoring of tap water resources at different scales. These isotopic baselines also have valuable applications in human forensic studies in Canada.					; bataille, clement/K-1063-2012; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009; Jameel, Yusuf/AAA-5382-2020	Bataille, Clement P./0000-0001-8625-4658; Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228; 														2767-3219				JAN 24	2023	2	1							e0000068	10.1371/journal.pwat.0000068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pwat.0000068													WOS:001416211100001

The present study investigates the origin of fluoride and the reason for its accumulation in the rift waters, following two hypotheses: (i) fluid-rock-interactions release fluoride from minerals into the water and (ii) magmatic-derived fluoride-containing liquids and gases migrate along permeable fault zones until they dissolve in ground-and surface water or be released to the atmosphere. Rock-, gas, water-, soil-, and plant samples were collected from the area within and close by the Aluto Volcanic Complex, which is part of the Main Ethiopian Rift. Most analyzed waters showed fluoride concentrations above the drinking water limit (> 1.5 mg/L) with the highest values in hot springs (up to 70 mg/L) and the geothermal well (76 mg/L). In the solid phase, a high fluoride content was found in acid volcanic rocks (ignimbrite: 4391 ppm; rhyolite: 3248 ppm) as well as in pumice (up to 1955 ppm). The fluoride content of soil samples collected within the volcanic complex varied between 82 and 1036 ppm, whereas former lake sediments from outside the Aluto Volcanic Complex showed higher fluoride contents ranging from 674 to 8171 ppm. Identified fluoride-rich minerals are various amphiboles (about 3 wt.-% F-), fluor-apatite (about 3 wt % F-), minerals of the fluorcaphite group (about 5 wt.-% F-), parisite (up to 9 wt.-% F-), and fluorite (CaF2). Elevated fluoride concentrations were also measured in some gas samples from fumaroles (up to 50 ppm) and in plant samples collected next to the fumaroles (up to 65 ppm). Leaching experiments of solid samples with deionized water demonstrated that fluoride can easily be mobilized from pumice and sediments but hardly from consolidated rocks. This fluoride release increased with temperature (up to 150 C) and correlated roughly with dis-solved silica indicating the binding of some fluoride to the amorphous or weakly crystalline silica fraction. Based on these results it was concluded that fluoride migrates via different pathways through the environment: At the depth of the magma chamber during magmatic differentiation fluoride enriches initially in the magmatic melt and accumulates in some late-crystallizing minerals of igneous rocks such as fluorite or mica. Upon volcanic eruption fluoride is predominantly incorporated in the glass (ignimbrite) and ash phase (pumice). On the surface, these rocks are exposed to weathering and fluoride leaches partly out into the aqueous phase. Soft and porous rocks such as pumice release fluoride first whereas hard extrusive/igneous rocks are less prone to weathering and retain the fluoride. Pumice and (lake) sediments might act both, as source and as sink for fluoride in the area. Although some fluoride might drain from the surface into the deeper subsoil, we conclude that magmatic fluids (liquid and gas) contribute more substantially to the overall fluoride ground water content because (i) of the much higher fluoride content in deep geothermal waters and hot springs as compared to surface-near waters; (ii) active geothermal surface manifestations located along fault zones indicate that fluids migrate from deep magmatic intrusions (as gas and liquid) towards the surface, where fluoride dissolves in groundwater; (iii) and the good correlation between bicarbonate (deriving from dissolution of magmatic CO2) and fluoride content in all analyzed water samples.					; Jolie, Egbert/AAH-3160-2020	Regenspurg, Simona/0000-0002-4327-1439; Wilke, Franziska/0000-0002-3463-6176													0883-2927	1872-9134				NOV	2022	146								105403	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105403		OCT 2022											WOS:000871090700003

Natural Lakes Are a Minor Global Source of N2O to the Atmosphere	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Natural lakes and reservoirs are important yet not well-constrained sources of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. In particular for N2O emissions, a huge variability is observed in the few, observation-driven flux estimates that have been published so far. Recently, a process-based, spatially explicit model has been used to estimate global N2O emissions from more than 6,000 reservoirs based on nitrogen (N) and phosphorous inflows and water residence time. Here we extend the model to a data set of 1.4 million standing water bodies comprising natural lakes and reservoirs. For validation, we normalized the simulated N2O emissions by the surface area of each water body and compared them against regional averages of N2O emission rates taken from the literature or estimated based on observed N2O concentrations. We estimate that natural lakes and reservoirs together emit 4.5 +/- 2.9 Gmol N2O-N year(-1) globally. Our global-scale estimate falls in the far lower end of existing, observation-driven estimates. Natural lakes contribute only about half of this flux, although they contribute 91% of the total surface area of standing water bodies. Hence, the mean N2O emission rates per surface area are substantially lower for natural lakes than for reservoirs with 0.8 +/- 0.5 versus 9.6 +/- 6.0 mmol N center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1), respectively. This finding can be explained by on average lower external N inputs to natural lakes. We conclude that upscaling-based estimates, which do not distinguish natural lakes from reservoirs, are prone to important biases.

This study explores these dynamics in the Pengxi River, a tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir, focusing on nutrient stratification and algal blooms. We hypothesized that nutrient levels in eutrophic waters with stable stratification correlate with HAB magnitude and that disruption of stratification triggers blooms due to nutrient shifts. A 38-day sampling campaign in Gaoyang Lake (April 16-May 23, 2022) revealed that consistent weather between April 26 and May 16 led to a surface density layer, restricting nutrient transfer and causing a bloom with 173.0 mu g L-( 1) Chl-a on May 1. After a heavy rain on May 18, a peak bloom on May 20, dominated by Ceratium hirundinella, , showed 533 mu g L- 1 Chl-a. There was a significant negative correlation between Cyanobacteria and C. hirundinella biomasses (r =-0.296, P < 0.01), highlighting nutrient availability and physical stability's roles in regulating HABs.

Nocturnal velvet ant males (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) of Deep Canyon, California including four new species and a fifth new species from Owens Lake Valley, California	ZOOTAXA												The diversity of nocturnal velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) at the Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center of southern California is investigated. Thirty-five species are found to inhabit areas on and around the canyon. Odontophotopsis hammetti, Sphaeropthalma chandleri, S. fergusoni, and S. mankelli are described as new species. Odontophotopsis hammetti and S. mankelli are only known from Deep Canyon. Sphaeropthalma chandleri and S. fergusoni also are known from Painted Canyon located in the Mecca Hills on east the side of the Coachella Valley and from Corn Springs located east of the Coachella Valley in the Chuckwalla Mountains, respectively. The females of too few of the species are known, so only the males are treated. A key is provided for the males. A new species-group, the S. fergusoni species-group is described to house S. fergusoni and the new species S. arnalduri, which is an apterous male described from Owens Lake Valley. Similarities between the fauna of Deep Canyon and the Algodones Sand Dunes are discussed.																			1175-5326	1175-5334				JUL 29	2010		2553					1	34																WOS:000280464600001

The phytoplankton of the protected Lake Borovoe was examined in the summer season of 2019, at eight stations, which were defined for the first time as the monitoring sites on the lake surface. Altogether, 72 algae and cyanobacteria species from seven taxonomic phyla were found in the Lake Borovoe phytoplankton during the study period. The most species-rich were three phyla: diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria. The average phytoplankton abundance was 3012.6 cells L-1, and biomass was 2383.41 mg L-1. The ecological status of the lake in 2019 was assessed based on the species richness, abundance, biomass, and calculated indices of organic pollution and toxic impact. The statistical mapping, calculated community similarity, correlation, and Redundancy Analysis (RDA) revealed zones affected by human impact. These were located in the lake shores and low-alkaline water with the saprobity index of 1.63-2.00. This is typical for naturally clean lakes, indicating the oligotrophic-to-mesotrophic status of the lake during the study period. The increase in cyanobacteria species in coastal communities can be associated with an increase in the biogenic load on the lake ecosystem in recent times. Therefore, our multivariate analysis allowed us to assess the ecological state of Lake Borovoe, which can be the result of the interaction of many external environmental factors, such as climatic conditions, long-term accumulation of organic substances, the intensity and duration of anthropogenic press, and internal lake processes such as the development of algae communities. The results suggest a tendency for the eutrophication of Lake Borovoe to increase because of pollution coming from the human impact zones on the lake shores.

The primary objectives of this paper were to analyze the protozoa, metazoa, and macroinvertebrate assemblages in different types of peatbogs, and to assess the influence of potential predators on protozoa communities. Sampling was done in six peatbogs from May to October 2012 in a transect including lagg and open peatbog. The results of DCA analysis showed that Axis and Axis 2 explained 49.8% of the total variance in composition of studied zoocenosis. The distribution of samples in ordination space led us to conclude that studied habitats are distributed along the falling gradient of water level and rising gradient of total organic carbon and nitrate nitrogen. Nevertheless, the number of significant correlations between the main groups of organisms forming the food web was different among sites, and in highmoore peatbogs the relationships between food web components were the strongest.

When to conduct an isotopic survey for lake water balance evaluation in highly seasonal climates	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												One-time or short-term lake water isotopic surveys are often employed to evaluate regional lake water balance. However, it can be difficult to determine the optimal time-window for sampling to obtain a representative long-term perspective of lake water balance in settings influenced by seasonal variations in precipitation, evaporative loss, glacial/snow meltwater, and larger seasonal shifts in isotopic composition of precipitation. This is especially true for areas of the Tibetan Plateau that are influenced by the summer Indian monsoon. Although high-frequency sampling is always preferred as the most rigorous approach to characterize the water budget of lakes or watersheds, this may be impractical in remote regions and over large spatial scales. To assess the potential sensitivity of isotope balance characterization to seasonal variability, we used a weekly lake water isotope data set acquired over a period of 3years on the Tibetan Plateau to evaluate the potential inaccuracies that might have arisen from using isotopic data collected during narrower time-windows. For this assessment, we use weekly isotopic data collected during the study and assume that these sampling events were stand-alone one-time surveys. We then demonstrate the sensitivity of the isotope balance method in this setting, particularly for the rainy season that significantly underestimated the evaporation/inflow. In contrast, isotopic composition of the lake water was found to be more representative of long-term conditions when sampled in October on the Tibetan Plateau. To broaden our evaluation of seasonality effects over a range of climatic zones, published high-frequency isotopic data were also compiled, and a similar assessment was carried out for selected regions of the world. The synthesized data and model outputs, which confirm pronounced variations in lake water isotopic composition and evaporation/inflow across a range of seasonal climates, were used to determine optimal sampling windows for these specific regions.					; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009	Cui, Jiangpeng/0000-0003-4587-541X; Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228													0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 30	2018	32	3					379	387		10.1002/hyp.11420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11420													WOS:000423341300005

In the present study, we investigated vitellogenin (Vtg) in the plasma of adult male C. tarichi, sampled monthly from Edremit, Campus and Carpanak sites of Van Edremit Gulf (VEG) of lake, between October 2004 and May 2005. The fish living around VEG winters in deep water around Edremit site. University and Carpanak sites are also on fish migration way from VEG to fresh water (Karasu River). The levels of measured plasma Vtg changed from trace levels to 26.35 A mu g/mL. The highest level of plasma Vtg was detected in April, with a concentration of 21.60 +/- A 1.29 A mu g/mL. We also performed immunohistochemical Vtg staining in the liver sections of male fish and determined Vtg positive hepatocytes in the liver of 1/10 sampled fish.

J	JONES, HG; OUELLET, M				JONES, HG; OUELLET, M			MECHANISMS FOR THE TRANSLOCATION OF CHEMICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCES IN THE ICE COVER OF SOME LAKES	EAU DU QUEBEC												A series of studies carried out between 1973 and 1980 on the evolution of the structure of ice cover, the chemical quality of ice cover and the chemistry of the underlying waters of Lakes Matamek, Mistassini, Nathalie, Piche, Saint-Jean and Tantare in Quebec (Canada), has led to the determination of the factors responsible for the chemical changes in the ice cover during the winter season. After freeze-up (black-ice) the snow which accumulates on the ice shows structural changes (metamorphosis of snow, white-ice formation) due to alternate melt and freeze cycles of water percolating through the snow. This results in the vertical migration of chemical compounds originally from the precipitation, towards the interface between the black and white-ice boundary of the ice cover. This often gives rise to a zone of slush of water the water component shows changes in its chemical quality in both space and time. The underlying waters contribute predominately to the chemical quality of the ice cover when the latter is flooded under a heavy snow-load during black ice failure (thermal cracking). Additional evidence has led to 2 further hypotheses for transport mechanisms of chemical compounds through black ice. These mechanisms are the water movements due to capillary action in a black-ice interstitial channels and the intercrystalline migration of chemical inclusions in black-ice. The relative importance of these translocation mehcniasms cannot be presently ascertained from the data.																			0315-2081						1983	16	1					71	+																WOS:A1983QK81200009
J	Kramer, JB; Canonica, S; Hoigne, J; Kaschig, J				Kramer, JB; Canonica, S; Hoigne, J; Kaschig, J			Degradation of fluorescent whitening agents in sunlit natural waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Stilbene-type fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs), such as the distyryl biphenyl (DSBP) and the diaminostilbene types (DAS 1 and DAS 2), are commonly used in detergents and papers. They are not readily biodegradable, but due to their ability to absorb part of the terrestial sunlight, they can be photochemically degraded in natural surface waters. Following a fast preceding photoisomerization, the three compounds are degraded by direct photochemical processes yielding mainly aldehydes and alcohols. Their degradation quantum yields are similar, about 10(-4). Nevertheless, in samples of a eutrophic Swiss lake water, DSBP is photochemically degraded three times faster (t(1/2) = 87 min) in summer noon terrestrial sunlight at 25 degrees C than DAS 1 and DAS 2 (t(1/2) = 278 and 313 min) because of a higher rate of sunlight absorption by the DSBP isomer mixture. All FWAs are degraded faster if the oxygen concentration is increased. Dissolved natural organic material partly inhibits the degradation of DSBP in the reaction with molecular oxygen. The behavior of these compounds illustrates the influence of a preceding isomer equilibrium on degradation rate coefficients.																			0013-936X					JUL	1996	30	7					2227	2234		10.1021/es950711a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es950711a													WOS:A1996UU54800041

Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem responses to early Holocene rapid climate change (RCC) events in the South Carpathian Mountains, Romania	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												As demonstrated by an increasing number of palaeoclimatic and palaeoecological studies, rapid climate change events (RCCs) occurred frequently in the Holocene and their timing correlates well in the European records. Changes in vegetation composition and environmental conditions were significant during these RCC events. In this study we use high resolution pollen, stomata, micro- and macrocharcoal, macrofossil, siliceous algae, biogenic silica and organic content analyses from two alpine lake sediments (Lake Brazi, 1740 m a.s.l.; Lake Gales, 1990 m a.s.l.) in the Retezat Mts, South Carpathian Mountains, Romania. Our aim is to study ecosystem responses to RCCs between 12,000 and 7000 cal yr BP using high-resolution proxy analyses of the relevant sediment sections. We detected several significant changes in the terrestrial vegetation composition and aquatic ecosystems in case of both lakes. Complex ecosystem responses were found in connection with the early Holocene RCC intervals. Most prominently, the 10.2 ka climatic change likely fostered the extinction of Larix decidua from the shore of Lake Brazi, while climatic change during the 8.2 ka event facilitated the establishment of Carpinus betulus in the lower deciduous mixed oak forests, due to decreasing growing season temperatures, frequent summer droughts and associated recurrent fire events. Taken together, most of the significant pollen compositional changes reflected the periodic spread of pioneer deciduous tree taxa (mainly Fraxinus excelsior and Corylus avellana) during the early Holocene RCCs. In all cases, this change was connectable to increased regional fire activity and the temporary increase of herbs. The most significant change in the lake-ecosystems was often the short-lived spread of various planktonic diatom species, mainly the members of genus Aulacoseira. Sudden appearance and large-scale percentage increase of these taxa suggested higher water-depth and/or intensified water turbulence. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

These landscapes are very heterogeneous, and the omnipresent water bodies within them act as a carbon source. Yet, few studies have focused on the impact of these water bodies on the landscape carbon budget. We deepen our understanding of carbon emissions from thermokarst ponds and constrain their impact by comparing carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from these ponds to fluxes from the surrounding tundra. We use eddy covariance measurements from a tower located at the border between a large pond and semi-terrestrial tundra. When we take the open-water areas of thermokarst ponds into account, our results show that the estimated summer carbon uptake of the polygonal tundra is 11 % lower. Further, the data show that open-water methane emissions are of a similar magnitude to polygonal tundra emissions. However, some parts of the pond's shoreline exhibit much higher emissions. This finding underlines the high spatial variability in methane emissions. We conclude that gas fluxes from thermokarst ponds can contribute significantly to the carbon budget of Arctic tundra landscapes. Consequently, changes in the water body distribution of tundra landscapes due to permafrost degradation may substantially impact the overall carbon budget of the Arctic.

Characteristics and distribution of natural flow regimes in Canada: a habitat template approach	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Extremes of flow and patterns of flow variability limit the distribution and abundance of riverine species via a natural disturbance regime. Using a habitat template approach, we describe the distribution and characteristics of natural flow regimes in Canada based on the severity of flows, flow predictability, and flow variability. Bayesian clustering was used to group 888 gauged watersheds across Canada into 10 classes. Some flow classes were found in all provinces, whereas others showed greater regional grouping related to land physiography (e. g., Canadian Shield and ecozones). Ontario and British Columbia had the greatest diversity of flow classes. Larger river systems tended towards less harsh flow regimes and greater flow regularity than small systems. A stream-lake network pattern, particularly the presence of lakes, decreased the severity of flow. The flow metric flood-free interval was found to be a potentially misleading indicator of reduced disturbance for high-latitude streams in Canada where ice formation and persistence are important stress factors for biota. Most flow stations had an 80% or higher chance of belonging to their primary membership class. Quantifying uncertainty in class assignment can help fellow scientists and resource managers appropriately apply our findings.

Several techniques including 14 CH 4 oxidation assays, culture-based most probable number (MPN) estimates of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) and protozoan abundance, MOB strain isolation and characterization, and PCR techniques were used to investigate methanotrophy at a forested swamp near Ithaca, New York. The greatest methanotrophic activity and largest numbers of MOB occurred predominantly at the low oxygen sediment/water interface in the water column. Seasonally, methanotrophic activity was very dynamic, ranging from 0.1 to 61.9 mumoles CH4 d(-1) g(-1) dry sediment, and correlated most strongly with dissolved inorganic carbon (r = 0.896). Incorporation of methanotrophic variables (abundance and activity) into existing CH4 flux regression models improved model fit, particularly during mid summer when CH4 fluxes were most dynamic. Annually integrated methane flux and methanotrophic activity measurements indicate that differences in methanotrophic activity at the sediment/water interface likely accounted for differences in the annual CH4 emission from the field site. Direct isolations of MOB resulted in the repeated isolation of organisms most closely related to Methylomonas methanica S1. A single acidophilic, type II MOB related to Methylocella palustris K was also isolated. Using a PCR-based MPN method and 16S rRNA genome copy number from isolates and control strains, type I and type II MOB were enumerated and revealed type I dominance of the sediment-associated MOB community.

Melis; Gemici, Uensal; Filiz, Sevki			Hydrogeochemical investigation of Kucuk Menderes River coastal wetland, Selcuk-Izmir, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Kucuk Menderes River forms a rich coastal wetland inside in the Selcuk plain. Three saline/brackish lakes, one swamp and Kucuk Menderes River are these wetlands' components. Alkaline-slightly alkaline type lakes are recharged from precipitation and karstic springs that discharge from marble-schist and marble-alluvium contacts in the northern and southern parts of the study area. Water types of the wetland are Na-Cl and Na-Ca-Mg-HCO3-Cl in both rainy and dry seasons. Both seawater intrusion and evaporation, as being the sources of the ions, justify the presence of Na-Cl, Na-SO4 and Cl-SO4, in the wetland water. Environmental isotopes were used to identify the relationship between wetland and groundwater in the Selcuk plain. The delta O-18 and delta D composition of wetland area samples have changed between -6.42 to -4.56 parts per thousand, and -36.40 to -23.80 parts per thousand, respectively. The lakes and rivers are plotted on the mixing line by slope of 5.2 and these data indicate that wetland is affected from seawater intrusion. The recharge area that was sampled in order to compare the wetland has Ca-HCO3 water type with a neutral-slightly alkaline pH values and the main hydrogeochemical process is weathering the different types of silicates. Iron, manganese and selenium are the dominant minor ions due to the high biological activities and organic matters in the lakes. There are two contamination risks for this wetland: (1) waste disposal site and (2) water treatment plant where the purified waters are released into the river. EC, Al, As, Cd, Cu, Fe and Zn values exceed those of aquatic life standards. In the near future these sites will pose a danger for wetland wild life and surrounding irrigation water suppliers.

However, there is a paucity of such information for the lakes covering both the entire year and the long term. Since 1986, we have collected large volume water samples for both dissolved and particulate phase contaminant analyses from stations at the head (Fort Erie-FE) and mouth (Niagara-on-the-Lake-NOTL) of the Niagara River throughout the whole year, including winter. Many of the organic contaminants measured over the period 1986 to 2001 exhibited seasonal variation. The different seasonal patterns were due to three general causes: (1) the exchange of contaminants across the air/water interface; (2) the seasonal nature of specific activities such as the application of agricultural insecticides and herbicides, and residential heating; and (3) the effect of suspended particulate material (SPM) quantity and composition on the particulate phase concentrations of contaminants. These are illustrated by the four contaminant examples (alpha-HCH, alpha-endosulfan, acenaphthylene, PCB) discussed in this paper. Where data were available for comparison, the seasonal patterns of these four contaminants in the river were generally consistent with those observed in Lakes Erie and Ontario over the period 1992 to 1995. Results suggest that the evaluation of contaminant concentrations, cycling and trends based on single temporal samples from the Great Lakes water column should be questioned. This is a significant issue given its widespread practice. Sampling Connecting Channels water may be, in general, a useful alternative to temporal lake sampling.																			0380-1330						2003	29	4					594	607		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70463-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70463-8													WOS:000187946400007

The outbreak occurred among fish of the 1972 brood during the spring of 1973. An estimated 825.6 million eggs were deposited in the Chilko River in 1972, and the production of 31.4 million fry that migrated into the lake in 1973 was significantly lower than the 55.1 million fry expected. The egg-to-fry survival of 3.8% was the lowest ever recorded at Chilko Lake (1949-73). The estimated fry-to-smolt survival of 57.1% was well within the normal range for this lake. Apparently IHN severely reduced the survival of the 1972 brood of sockeye salmon fry at Chilko Lake, and all or nearly all of the reduction occurred during the egg-to-fry stage of the life cycle.																									1976	33	7					1564	1567		10.1139/f76-196	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-196													WOS:A1976BV79400006
J	Mohebzadeh, H; Fallah, M				Mohebzadeh, Hamid; Fallah, Mahboobeh			Quantitative analysis of water balance components in Lake Urmia, Iran using remote sensing technology	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												Accurate quantification of water balance components in large lakes is of great importance in assessing the changes in hydrological components, and subsequent variations in lakes water balance. The water balance of Urmia Lake in northwestern Iran was quantitatively analyzed in the year 2005 using remotely-sensed data (e.g. evapotranspiration and precipitation) and meteorological data. The analysis was based on GIS operations. For this purpose, the estimation of pixel-scaled monthly evapotranspiration (ET) was conducted via the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) using time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and meteorological data; precipitation was derived from the monthly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations; surface runoff was estimated by the empirical formula; and finally, the computations of recharge were carried out using the water balance approach for the winter months where estimation of ET and surface runoff were subtracted from precipitation. Water balance components were quantified for the lake and the lake basin separately. Results showed that the water balance components calculated by remote sensing were in conformity with the reported figures in the literature. According to the results of the water balance method, Urmia Lake was suffering from a negative water balance of 3443 MCM yr(-1). Findings of this study demonstrated the application of the derived satellite data in estimating lake's water balance components in order to improve the accuracy of the lake water budget calculation.

However, while aeolian sediment dynamics are reasonably well understood, there is a lack of knowledge with regard to variability in the fluvial systems. Presented here are the findings from several locations within wadi drainage systems to the west of the Hajar Mountains (United Arab Emirates). The performance of optically stimulated luminescence dating using a customized standardized growth curve approach is investigated, showing that this approach allows reliable determination of ages by reducing the machine time required. Three main periods of fluvial activity occurred at 160-135, 43-34, and ca. 20 ka. Additional ages fall into the latest Pleistocene and Late Holocene. None of the ages coincides with major wet periods in SE Arabia that have been identified in stalagmites and by the deposition of lake sediments. It is shown that fluvial activity was partly contemporaneous (within the given time resolution) with phases of aeolian deposition and was almost continuous, but likely sporadic, during the Middle to Late Pleistocene. This highlights the need for regionally defined paleoenvironmental records to fully understand the response of dryland systems to long-term climatic change.					; Parker, Adrian/X-2596-2019	Mueller, Daniela/0000-0001-6247-3418; Preston, Gareth/0000-0002-1305-9410; Parker, Adrian/0000-0003-2989-7344; Preusser, Frank/0000-0002-5654-1346; Bretzke, Knut/0000-0002-5397-7224; Raith, Kira/0000-0002-4736-3744													0033-5894	1096-0287				MAR	2023	112						111	127	PII S0033589422000515	10.1017/qua.2022.51	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2022.51		NOV 2022											WOS:000877913000001

Evidence for three morphotypes among anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) sampled in the marine environment	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Variable resource use and responses to environmental conditions can lead to phenotypic diversity and distinct morphotypes within salmonids, including Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). Despite the cultural and economic importance of Arctic char in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR), limited data exist on the extent and presence of morphological diversity in this region. This is of concern for management given climate change impacts on regional fish populations. The authors investigated morphological diversity in anadromous Arctic char sampled during their summer marine migration-residency period when seasonal harvesting occurs in a coastal mixed-stock fishery. Geometric morphometric analysis was conducted using digital photographs of live Arctic char (n = 103) of which a sub-set was subsequently implanted with acoustic transmitters (n = 90) and released, and their overwintering lakes determined using active acoustic telemetry surveys. Twenty-three morphological landmarks were established and overlaid on digital images, and nine linear measurements of the body and head were recorded. Principle component analysis and K-means clustering based on linear measurements categorised fish into three morphotypes: slender body and slim head (n = 31), small and short head with a small mouth (n = 46) and elongated head shape with large mouth (n = 26). Tagged individuals of the three morphotypes occupied all lakes with no distinction observed. The three Arctic char morphotypes detected in this coastal mixed-stock fishery could represent adaptation to specific feeding-movement behaviours potentially tied to juvenile residency in freshwater systems, efficient exploitation of the marine prey pulse, or are relicts from ancestral types. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to identify distinct Arctic char morphotypes occurring in sympatry in the marine environment. Identifying phenotypic diversity will assist management to promote the sustainability of this regional fishery.

In this study, the changes in the lake depth of Lake Qinghai on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau were reconstructed from analyses of biomarkers in sediment records from the center of the lake and aeolian deposits on its southern bank. On millennial scale, the lake depth showed a fluctuating upward trend from the minimum depth at 15.6 ka to the maximum depth at 5.9 ka, revealing an overall warming-wetting pattern since the last deglaciation. Compared to the typical monsoon-dominated areas, the relatively humid late Holocene of Lake Qinghai appears to have been related to a weakened evaporation on the long-term trend. We show that on a long-term scale, precipitation may control the rate of changes in lake depth. This reasonably explains the asynchrony of precipitation and lake depth over the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the mid-Holocene.

Dail			Morphological, ecological and toxicological aspects of Raphidiopsis raciborskii (Cyanobacteria) in a eutrophic urban subtropical lake in southern Brazil	IHERINGIA SERIE BOTANICA												A dense perennial bloom of Raphidiopsis raciborskii was observed in an urban lake (29 degrees 53'13 '' S and 51 degrees 09'29.9 '' W). Due to supposed toxicity, this study analyzed the morphology of the species, evaluated the main factors that influence its growth, and examined bloom toxicity. Two sites were sampled monthly from November 2009 to November 2010. The species was found in all samples and dominated in 77% of the samples. Highest density was recorded at the end of summer (March - 199,550 ind.mL(-1)) at 26.6 degrees C and pH 7.8. High densities were also found at low temperatures (72,145 ind.mL(-1) at 12.6 degrees C and 130,475 ind.mL(-1) at 14.5 degrees C) and at minimum (5.4) and maximum (8.7) pH, reaching 89,964 ind.mL(-1) and 61,400 ind.mL(-1), respectively. Nitrogen availability was high, especially ammonium [(60-)140-660 mu g.L-1], and phosphorus was low (orthophosphate < 10 mu g.L-1). These results support that R. raciborskii has a wide tolerance to abiotic variations. Saxitoxins and gonyautoxins were found in the bloom.					; Laughinghouse, Haywood/M-5836-2016; Tucci, Andrea/D-3726-2015; Tucci, Andréa/D-3726-2015	Yunes, Joao/0000-0002-4792-7626; Tucci, Andrea/0000-0001-9173-1228; 														2446-8231					2020	75								e2020018	10.21826/2446-82312020v75e2020018	http://dx.doi.org/10.21826/2446-82312020v75e2020018													WOS:000592437500018

A millennial-scale Late Pleistocene-Holocene palaeoclimatic record from the western Chihuahua Desert, Mexico	BOREAS												We present elemental concentrations and magnetic susceptibility data from a new 270-cm-long sediment core collected from the western part of palaeolake Babicora and infer millennial-scale hydrological variations over the last 27?cal. ka in the western Chihuahua Desert. Variations in the available water content at the sedimentair interface of the watershed, lake salinity and lake productivity are inferred from values of the chemical index of alteration (CIA), CaCO 3 and Corg, respectively. An abrupt increase in runoff at c. 24?cal. ka BP appears correlative with the Heinrich 2 (H2) event. Except for this event, diminished runoff between c. 27 and 19?cal. ka BP indicates lower annual precipitation (weak summer rainfall) during the Last Glacial Maximum. The deposition of chemically altered sediments between c. 25 and 22?cal. ka BP results from the higher sedimentwater interaction in the watershed owing to lower evaporation, cooler conditions and higher precipitation during the H2 event. Since 19?cal. ka BP the runoff has been characterized by high-amplitude fluctuations with intervals of reduced precipitation identified at c. 19, 18, 17.5, 1314, 11.5, 10, 7.5 and 3?cal. ka BP.					; Jonathan, MP/AAA-4427-2020; Muthuswamy Ponniah, Jonathan/I-5764-2018; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018	Perez Cruz, Ligia Lucina/0000-0001-6991-5143; Muthuswamy Ponniah, Jonathan/0000-0001-9040-4911; Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; QUIROZ JIMENEZ, JESUS DAVID/0000-0003-2439-2048; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				OCT	2012	41	4					707	717		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2012.00266.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2012.00266.x													WOS:000309394800013
J	de Castro, F; Gaedke, U				de Castro, Francisco; Gaedke, Ursula			The metabolism of lake plankton does not support the metabolic theory of ecology	OIKOS												We tested if the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) correctly predicts plankton metabolism in a temperate lake, based on a long-term (about 15 years), high-frequency dataset of body size, abundance and production, using two different techniques: least squares regression and maximum likelihood. For phytoplankton, the general fit was relatively poor (r(2) = 0.53). The assumption of the MTE on temperature dependence of metabolism was not supported, and the assumed value of 3/4 of the allometric exponent was barely within 95% confidence limits. For some of the models, the value of b was significantly higher than 3/4. When radiation was included as an additional predictor, it improved the model considerably (r(2) = 0.67). Including grazing by zooplankton reduced the model residuals during the summer period, when grazing is a dominant factor. The allometric exponent had virtually no effect for phytoplankton, due to little variability in average individual size. Zooplankton production, on the other hand, was better predicted by MTE, showing stronger effects of temperature and body size, the average of which varied by a factor of more than a hundred. However, the best-fitting value of the allometric exponent for zooplankton was 0.85, and significantly higher than the 3/4 predicted by the theory. The ratio of observed production to biomass for the entire plankton community declined linearly with the body size (in log-log) with a slope corresponding to a value of b = 0.85. We conclude that the MTE has little predictive power for the metabolism of lacustrine plankton, in particular for phytoplankton, and especially at the scale of variability of this study, and that this could be improved by incorporating radiation into the model.					; de Castro, Francisco/G-2213-2011	de Castro, Francisco/0000-0001-8834-3363; 													0030-1299	1600-0706				AUG	2008	117	8					1218	1226		10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16547.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16547.x													WOS:000258288700010

Precipitations are the dominant driving factor in lake level fluctuations. The present study investigates the potential role of remote forcing through global sea surface temperature (SST) fields in modulating recent hydroclimatic variability in Southeastern South America and especially over the Laguna Mar Chiquita region. Daily precipitation and temperature are extracted from a multi-member LMDz atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) ensemble of simulations forced by HadISST1 observed time-varying global SST and sea-ice boundary conditions from 1950 to 2005. The various members of the ensemble are only different in their atmospheric initial conditions. Statistical downscaling (SD) is used to adjust precipitation and temperature from LMDz ensemble mean at the station scale over the basin. A coupled basin-lake hydrological model (cpHM) is then using the LMDz-downscaled (LMDz-SD) climate variables as input to simulate the lake behavior. The results indicate that the long-term lake level trend is fairly well depicted by the LMDz-SD-cpHM simulations. The 1970s level rise and high-level conditions are generally well captured in timing and in magnitude when SST-forced AGCM-SD variables are used to drive the cpHM. As the LMDz simulations are forced solely with the observed sea surface conditions, the global SST seems to have an influence on the lake level variations of Laguna Mar Chiquita. As well, this study shows that the AGCM-SD-cpHM model chain is a useful approach for evaluating long-term lake level fluctuations in response to the projected climate changes.

We examined the influence of the mesh size effects on zooplankton community structure by comparing abundance, biomass and seasonal cycles of mesozooplankton. The study was performed at five stations (four in the marine lakes 'Veliko jezero' and 'Malo jezero', and one in the open sea in front of the lakes) during a 1-year period (February 2008-February 2009). The estimated differences obtained from the catch results of the different mesh nets were more pronounced in semi-enclosed coastal areas, such as lakes, than in the oligotrophic conditions prevailing at the station in the front of the lakes. Total zooplankton abundance with the 125-mu m net was significantly greater than with the 200-mu m net. The differences were mainly due to the loss of small-sized copepods in the samples collected with the 200-mu m net. Excepting copepods, major losses were recorded for Limacina spp. and Bivalvia larvae. Abundance losses through the coarser net reflect the community structure and seasonal abundance pattern, which is most pronounced during the summer. Diversity indices and total dry weight were less influenced by mesh selection. The retention efficiency of the 125-mu m mesh size must be taken into account to provide a reliable description of the mesozooplankton community structure in coastal and especially eutrophicated areas. The 200-mu m mesh net could be recommended for oligotrophic systems due to the catch of larger calanoid species that contribute to overall zooplankton biomass, and because it allows a comparison with historical datasets.

Influence of Habitat Characteristics on Shore-Spawning Kokanee	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka and kokanee (lacustrine Sockeye Salmon) commonly spawn in both lentic and lotic environments; however, the habitat requirements of shore spawners are virtually unknown relative to those of stream spawners. A laboratory experiment and an in situ incubation study were conducted to better understand the influence of habitat characteristics on the shoreline incubation success of kokanee. The laboratory experiment assessed kokanee intragravel survival, fry emergence, and fry condition in response to eight substrate treatments. The in situ study, conducted at three major shoreline spawning sites in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, evaluated the effect of depth, substrate composition, dissolved oxygen, shoreline slope, and groundwater on intragravel survival. Substrate size composition was generally a poor predictor of survival in both the laboratory experiment and in situ study; although, fry condition and counts of emerged fry in the laboratory were lowest for the substrate treatment that had the highest proportion of fine sediment. Results of the in situ study suggest that groundwater flow plays an important role in enhancing intragravel survival in habitats generally considered unsuitable for spawning.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2014	143	6					1404	1418		10.1080/00028487.2014.931302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2014.931302													WOS:000345706800003

Two ways of biological control (i.e., a combination of filter-feeding fishes plus submerged plants and submerged plants alone) were tested in a large-scale in situ enclosure experiment, carried out at Gonghu Bay of Taihu Lake, China. Changes of both phytoplankton flora and water quality under two experimental conditions were dynamically monitored. The results showed that (1) filter-feeding fishes decreased the phytoplankton density and promoted phytoplankton biodiversity, while submerged plants inhibited phytoplankton only in spring and showed no significant effect on phytoplankton biodiversity. (2) Submerged plants improved the water quality, however, filter-feeding fishes had adverse impact on it. Thus, we tentatively concluded that filter-feeding fishes is more effective than submerged plants in regulating phytoplankton flora, while submerged plants play an important role in improving water quality.

J	Fischer, P; Eckmann, R				Fischer, P; Eckmann, R			Seasonal changes in fish abundance, biomass and species richness in the littoral zone of a large European lake, Lake Constance, Germany	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Seasonal changes in the abundance, biomass and species richness of fish in the littoral zone of Lake Constance were examined. Electric fishing was conducted in three depth strata at six different sampling sites within the littoral zone from November 1991 to Februar 1993 during daytime. Minimal abundance and biomass values were observed in February with 3.9 (SD +/- 4.2) ind.100 m(-2) and 12.7 (SD +/- 13.8) g-wet.100 m(-2). Maximal abundance values were observed in August with 119.5 (SD +/- 85.5) ind.100 m(-2), maximal biomass values in May with 903.9 (SD +/- 1942.6) g-wet.100 m(-2). The influence of individual habitat variables on the littoral fish community was examined by canonical correlation analysis, Seasonal changes in total fish abundance, biomass and species richness were mainly explained by seasonal changes in water temperature followed by lake level. For the individual species, different substrate characteristics such as sediment type or the amount of large stones lying on the bottom providing shelter were also found to be important. However, these variables often influence fish abundance and biomass only within a range that is predefined by water temperature. Different patterns were found for the two benthic species, burbot (Lota lota) and stone leach (Noemacheilus barbatulus). The distribution of both species was mainly correlated with the availability of gravel substrate and shelter and mostly independent of littoral water temperature. Burbot larger than > 5 cm TL emigrated from the littoral into deeper adjacent areas during summer when water temperature increased above a certain threshold, indicating an upper thermal threshold for this cold stenothermal species.

Demography of the narrow endemic mint Dicerandra thinicola: Patterns, drivers, and management recommendations based on 18 years of data from its largest wild population	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												The mint genus Dicerandra is the rarest of any plants in the southeastern USA, and the narrow endemic D. thinicola H.A. Mill. is restricted to one wild population on public land and a few unprotected populations on private lands. From 2001 to 2017, we studied similar to 9,000 plants and 90,000 annual transitions in permanent plots in Florida scrub and roadsides to assess the health of this population and potential drivers of demographic change. Plant numbers have fluctuated widely, largely due to variably large pulses of winter seedling recruitment, but the overall trend has been upward, especially along sandy roadsides, in scrub gaps, and in chopped/burned scrub. Across the data set, annual survival (mean 67%) varied among habitats (being highest along roadsides) and among years (with decreased survival in some recent years). Nearly half of surviving vegetative plants advanced from vegetative to reproductive each year and most plants, once flowering, continued to flower each year. Growth in number of branches was consistently positive; only one-quarter of plants had reduced size each year. Relative growth rate was higher along roadsides than in other habitats. Reproductive output was lowest in scrub gaps and varied among years. Seedling recruitment was concentrated in winter months, varied widely among years, and was lower in the scrub matrix than in scrub gaps or roadsides. About half of seedlings died before their second year, the maximum observed life span was 13 yr, and fewer than 6% of plants survived 10 yr. Flowering began as early as age 2 (rarely as seedlings) and by age 4-7, 90% of surviving plants were reproductive. Land management (roller chopping and fire) in 2007 had profound effects on the population. Chopping killed 91% of plants and chopping followed by burning killed 100%. However, recruitment in these treated plots was 2.5 5.5 times higher in the 6 yr after treatments than in the 8 yr before treatments; no such differences were seen in untreated plots. Posttreatment plants grew faster and flowered earlier than other plants. Consequently, after several years, plant numbers in the treated areas had increased 4-8 times, whereas plant numbers in untreated areas changed little. This state-endangered plant is short-lived and depends heavily on disturbance (ideally fire) for recruitment and population growth. It is threatened not only by its narrow distribution but by insufficiently aggressive land management.

J	Jones, NT; Gilbert, B				Jones, Natalie T.; Gilbert, Benjamin			Changing climate cues differentially alter zooplankton dormancy dynamics across latitudes	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												In seasonal climates, dormancy is a common strategy that structures biodiversity and is necessary for the persistence of many species. Climate change will likely alter dormancy dynamics in zooplankton, the basis of aquatic food webs, by altering two important hatching cues: mean temperatures during the ice-free season, and mean day length when lakes become ice free. Theory suggests that these changes could alter diversity, hatchling abundances and phenology within lakes, and that these responses may diverge across latitudes due to differences in optimal hatching cues and strategies. To examine the role of temperature and day length on hatching dynamics, we collected sediment from 25 lakes across a 1800km latitudinal gradient and exposed sediment samples to a factorial combination of two photoperiods (12 and 16h) and two temperatures (8 and 12 degrees C) representative of historical southern (short photoperiod, warm) and northern (long photoperiod, cool) lake conditions. We tested whether sensitivity to these hatching cues varies by latitudinal origin and differs among taxa. Higher temperatures advanced phenology for all taxa, and these advances were greatest for cladocerans followed by copepods and rotifers. Although phenology differed among taxa, the effect of temperature did not vary with latitude. The latitudinal origin of the egg bank influenced egg abundance and hatchling abundance and diversity, with these latter effects varying with taxa, temperature and photoperiod. Copepod hatchling abundances peaked at mid-latitudes in the high temperature and long photoperiod treatments, whereas hatchling abundances of other zooplankton were greatest at low latitudes and high temperature. The overall diversity of crustacean zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) also reflected distinct responses of each taxa to our treatments, with the greatest diversity occurring at mid-latitudes (similar to 56 degrees N) in the shorter photoperiod treatment. Our results demonstrate that hatching cues differ for broad taxonomic groups that vary in developmental and life-history strategies. These differences are predicted to drive latitude-specific shifts in zooplankton emergence with climate change and could alter the base of aquatic food webs.

Isotopic evolution and climate paleorecords: modeling boundary effects in groundwater-dominated lakes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We used an isotopic mass-balance model to examine how the hydrogeologic setting of lakes influences isotopic response of evaporating lake water to idealized hydroclimatic changes. The model uses a monthly water and isotope balance approach with simplified water-column structure and groundwater exchanges. The framework for comparative simulations is provided by lakes in a region of the Northern Rocky Mountains that display high interlake geochemical variability, thought to be controlled by groundwater hydraulics. Our analysis highlights several isotopic effects of flow between aquifers and lakes, leading to possible divergence of isotopic paleorecords formed under a common climate. Amplitude of isotopic variation resulting from simulated climate forcing was greatly damped when high groundwater fluxes and/or low lake volume resulted in low lake fluid residence time. Differing precipitation and evaporation scenarios that are equivalent in annual fluid balance (P-E) resulted in different isotopic signatures, interpreted as a result of evaporation kinetics. Concentrating low-delta groundwater inflow during spring months raised springtime lake delta values, a counterintuitive result of coincidence between times of high groundwater inflow and the evaporation season. Transient effects of reduced fluid balance caused excursions opposite in sign from eventual steady-state isotopic shifts resulting from enhanced groundwater inflow dominance. Lags in response between climate forcing and isotopic signals were shortened by high groundwater fluxes and resulting short lake residence times. Groundwater-lake exchange exerts control over patterns of lake isotopic response to evaporation through effects on lake residence time, inflow composition, and seasonal timing of inflow and outflow. Sediments from groundwater-linked lakes, often used for paleoenvironmental analysis, should be expected to reflect isotopic complexities of the type shown here.

The epilimnion, dominated by the dinoflagellate alga Ceratium hirundella, was characterized by C20:5 and C22:6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The photic anoxic metalimnion supported a radically different community, dominated by photosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Chromatium and Chloronema spp.) and a Synechococcus-like cyanobacterium, and was characterized by high concentrations of C16 and C18 monounsaturated fatty acids. The fatty acid compositions of the hypolimnetic seston and the sediment were qualitatively similar to that of the metalimnion. Methyl-branched acids, commonly found in eubacteria, increased with depth in the water column. The concentrations of several unusual fatty acids found in Desulfovibrio spp. Desulfobacter spp. and Desulfotomaculum spp. were inversely related to sulfate concentration in the metalimnion. After the water column mixed in the winter, steep gradients of respiratory terminal electron acceptors developed in the surface sediment and were reflected in the polar lipid fatty acid compositions. The results show that fatty acids derived from the membranes of epilimnetic phytoplankton were efficiently metabolized in the oxic portion of the water column. The fatty acids synthesized by prokaryotic microorganisms at and below the oxycline dominated the sediment. The polar lipid fatty acid composition of the sediment showed seasonal changes which can be associated with concentrations of terminal electron acceptors of microbial respiration, and thus with physiologically distinct bacterial groups.					de Leeuw, Jan/F-6471-2011														0168-6496	1574-6941				DEC	1986	38	6					381	396		10.1016/0378-1097(86)90016-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1097(86)90016-9													WOS:A1986F678800008

Little is known about the manner in which frazil forms, how it is drawn down to the depths at which the intakes are located, and how to prevent frazil from fully blocking intakes. This paper presents an overview of frazil formation and intake blockage in the Great Lakes. The paper first reviews the current understanding of the processes of frazil formation and intake blockage, and it adds new insight regarding the processes. It then describes the problem by way of case-study examples of frazil blockage of two intakes in Lake Michigan. Based on the case studies, and experiences with other intakes in the Great Lakes, the paper outlines methods for monitoring and mitigating frazil blockage. Two options are recommended: monitoring rate of water level drop in the pump forebay onshore from the intake, and rate of headloss increase between the intake and the forebay. Laboratory modeling of intake blockage is then presented.																			0733-9429					AUG	2006	132	8					814	824		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2006)132:8(814)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2006)132:8(814)													WOS:000239075200007

CHANGES IN SNOWFALL IN THE SOUTHERN SIERRA NEVADA OF CALIFORNIA SINCE 1916	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT												A time series (1916-2009) of annual snowfall totals for Huntington Lake (HL, elev. 2141 m) in the southern Sierra Nevada of California is reconstructed. A reconstruction is (a) necessary because HL data after 1972 are mostly missing and (b) possible because nearby stations reveal high correlations with HL, two above 0.90. The results show mean annual snowfall in HL is 624 cm with an insignificant trend of +0.5 cm (+0.08%) +/- 13.1 cm decade(-1). Similar positive but insignificant trends for spring snowfall were also calculated. Annual stream flow and precipitation trends for the region again were insignificantly positive for the same period. Snow-water-equivalent comparisons, measured on 1 Apr since 1930 at 26 sites and since 1950 at 45, show similar small, mostly positive, and insignificant trends. These results combined with published temperature time series, which also reveal no significant trends, form a consistent picture of no remarkable long-term changes in the snowfall of this area and elevation of the southern Sierra Nevada of California since the early 20(th) century.																			0958-305X					JUL	2010	21	3					223	234		10.1260/0958-305X.21.3.233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1260/0958-305X.21.3.233													WOS:000290048500003

The pH values of the lakes, measured at the end of the summer, are nearly all above 6.0, but do not give any indication of the acid shock caused snowmelt. Of the lakes examined 38% may be regarded as sensitive to acidification, assuming a threshold alkalinity value of 200-mu-eq.L-1. Geology was the variable which had the greatest effect on alkalinity. The factor representing weathering in factor analysis was correlated both to the lithology and the land cover of the watershed. A median lake acidification of 35 to 65-mu-eq.L-1 was estimated using two different approaches.

J	Guretzky, JA; Dunn, CD; Bishop, A				Guretzky, John A.; Dunn, Cheryl D.; Bishop, Andy			Plant Community Structure and Forage Nutritive Value of Reed Canarygrass-Invaded Wetlands	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Many wetlands across the United States have been threatened by reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) invasion. The use of reed canarygrass as forage may provide a revenue stream for agricultural producers while improving wetland ecosystem services. Th is study was conducted to evaluate the effects of forage harvest frequency (zero, one, two, and three times per year) on plant community structure and nutritive value in reed canarygrass-invaded wetlands. The research was conducted in two wetlands (North Lake Basin [NLB] and Straight Water [SW]), with frequently ponded soils in Seward County, NE, from 2011 to 2013. Harvesting three times per year best maintained plant species richness at NLB but had no effect at SW. Reed canarygrass cover was 14 and 12% greater in unharvested compared with harvested stands at NLB and SW, respectively, but forb cover was unaffected by harvest frequency at either location. Forage harvested increased with harvest frequency during the cooler and wetter years of 2011 and 2013 but was limited by drought during 2012. Crude protein (CP) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) in reed canarygrass and forbs did not show consistent responses to harvest frequency. Across locations and years, reed canarygrass had 88 to 159 g CP kg(-1) and 534 to 680 g TDN kg-1. Harvesting wetlands more frequently decreases reed canarygrass cover and increases forage harvested, which are outcomes that could improve waterfowl habitat by increasing access to ponded water. The nutritive value of reed canarygrass at most times throughout the growing season exceeds nutritional requirements of mature, spring-calving beef cows.

Climate warming reduces fish production and benthic habitat in Lake Tanganyika, one of the most biodiverse freshwater ecosystems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Warming climates are rapidly transforming lake ecosystems worldwide, but the breadth of changes in tropical lakes is poorly documented. Sustainable management of freshwater fisheries and biodiversity requires accounting for historical and ongoing stressors such as climate change and harvest intensity. This is problematic in tropical Africa, where records of ecosystem change are limited and local populations rely heavily on lakes for nutrition. Here, using a similar to 1,500-y paleoecological record, we show that declines in fishery species and endemic molluscs began well before commercial fishing in Lake Tanganyika, Africa's deepest and oldest lake. Paleoclimate and instrumental records demonstrate sustained warming in this lake during the last similar to 150 y, which affects biota by strengthening and shallowing stratification of the water column. Reductions in lake mixing have depressed algal production and shrunk the oxygenated benthic habitat by 38% in our study areas, yielding fish and mollusc declines. Late-20th century fish fossil abundances at two of three sites were lower than at any other time in the last millennium and fell in concert with reduced diatom abundance and warming water. A negative correlation between lake temperature and fish and mollusc fossils over the last similar to 500 y indicates that climate warming and intensifying stratification have almost certainly reduced potential fishery production, helping to explain ongoing declines in fish catches. Long-term declines of both benthic and pelagic species underscore the urgency of strategic efforts to sustain Lake Tanganyika's extraordinary biodiversity and ecosystem services.					; McGlue, Michael/C-9752-2014; Kraemer, Benjamin/AAV-9299-2021; Swarzenski, Peter/AAD-8562-2022	McIntyre, Peter/0000-0003-1809-7552; Swarzenski, Peter/0000-0003-0116-0578; Kraemer, Benjamin/0000-0002-3390-9005; 													0027-8424					AUG 23	2016	113	34					9563	9568		10.1073/pnas.1603237113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1603237113								27503877					WOS:000381860800056

Evaporation was determined using an isotope mass balance approach which accounted quantitatively for isotopic fractionation, progressive evaporative enrichment of delta(18)O and delta(2)H in lake water, and attenuation of enrichment by liquid inputs and atmospheric moisture. Concurrent determinations made using standard mass balance, energy balance, aerodynamic profile and class A pans permitted rigorous comparisons between methods. Results are presented for two summers which had distinct weather conditions and hydrological balances. Overall, the delta(18)O balance was found to be in good agreement with standard methods during both years over time intervals greater than about one week. Owing to a less systematic response of delta(2)H over short time periods, it use is not recommended for quantitative mass balance determinations over time intervals of less than about 50 days in this setting.

The lava field developed through punctuated eruptions of low-volume pahoehoe lava, fed by lava tubes. During periods of rapid effusion, groundwater systems were able to transmit most of the recharge in the subsurface, probably by springs, and where there were areas of localized low permeability, ephemeral lakes developed. Subsequent lava flows underwent significant interaction with the partly consolidated lacustrine sediment, forming peperite deposits. Fluvial conglomerates, with extra-basinal clasts, are interbedded with the lava flows. The maturity of the fluvial system suggests a long-lived catchment that transported sediment westwards. Drainage was periodically deflected away from the lava field by the positive topographic relief created by the lava flows, and was re-established during periods of volcanic dormancy. The lava field developed over periods of decades, but the fluvial systems were longer-lived by three or four orders of magnitude. A key feature of this lava field and its drainage is that the establishment and abandonment of fluvial systems immediately adjacent to the lava field was primarily controlled by the eruption dynamics of the magmatic system.

Generally, dissolved oxygen (DO) consumption and net transport contribute to the observed DO decrease, but the latter was rarely considered in former studies. To examine the importance of both processes to MOM development in Lake Arendsee, Germany, we measured DO concentration and temperature with high spatial and temporal resolution during a complete stratification period. Vertical turbulent diffusivities were estimated from temporal changes of the heat content of the lake. The MOM development was not caused by locally enhanced DO consumption rates, but rather by a combination of vertical gradients in DO concentration and consumption. A vertical DO mass balance revealed that net DO transport into the metalimnion was in the same order of magnitude as DO consumption in the MOM. We found that DO consumption was governed by microbial respiration and the vertical variations of DO depletion rates in the metalimnion could be explained by a minor contribution of temperature and a higher contribution of turbidity, implying that the downward flux of particulate organic carbon promoted the MOM development. The intensive metalimnetic respiration in lakes forming a MOM can be expected to accelerate nutrient cycling close to the photic zone and thus, may further stimulate primary production.

Here, we tested the impact of volcanic ash fall and fire on vegetation composition analysing two sediment records, Lake Avutarda and Lake Bruja, located in the forest-steppe transition at 40 degrees S. In addition, our analysis provides the first account on the history of Nothofagus alpina at its eastern distribution limits. Our results comprise the last 3000 years, indicating the persistence of the vegetation despite evident volcanic activity documented by numerous tephra layers in both records. Eleven fire episodes were identified, while redundancy analysis indicates a non-significant influence of fire activity on the vegetation. The population increase of Nothofagus alpina represents the most important change in vegetation composition in the last three millennia. We speculate that the presumed change in climate, which led to the expansion of Austrocedrus chilensis south of the study area, also caused the increase of Nothofagus alpina populations in the region.					; Fontana, Sonia/N-2263-2014; Giesecke, Thomas/A-2450-2013	Alvarez Barra, Valentina Andrea/0000-0002-2180-6658; Fontana, Sonia/0000-0001-8238-4172; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				AUG	2020	30	8					1115	1128	0959683620913920	10.1177/0959683620913920	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620913920		APR 2020											WOS:000534050300001

Many studies focus on bloom events in lentic environments such as lakes or ponds. Comparatively few studies have explored lotic environments and fewer still have examined the cyanobacterial communities and potential cyanotoxin producers during ambient, non-bloom conditions. Here we used a metagenomics-based approach to profile non-bloom microbial communities and cyanobacteria in 12 major U.S. rivers at multiple time points during the summer months of 2019. Our data show that U.S. rivers possess microbial communities that are taxonomically rich, yet largely consistent across geographic location and time. Within these communities, cyanobacteria often comprise significant portions and frequently include multiple species with known cyanotoxin producing strains. We further characterized these potential cyanotoxin producing taxa by deep sequencing amplicons of the microcystin E (mcyE) gene. We found that rivers containing the highest levels of potential cyanotoxin producing cyanobacteria consistently possess taxa with the genetic potential for cyanotoxin production and that, among these taxa, the predominant genus of origin for the mcyE gene is Microcystis. Combined, these data provide a unique perspective on cyanobacteria and potential cyanotoxin producing taxa that exist in large rivers across the U.S. and can be used to better understand the ambient conditions that may precede bloom events in lotic freshwater ecosystems.

Martin			A soil moisture monitoring network to assess controls on runoff generation during atmospheric river events	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Soil moisture is a key modifier of runoff generation from rainfall excess, including during extreme precipitation events associated with Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). This paper presents a new, publicly available dataset from a soil moisture monitoring network in Northern California's Russian River Basin, designed to assess soil moisture controls on runoff generation under AR conditions. The observations consist of 2-min volumetric soil moisture at 19 sites and 6 depths (5, 10, 15, 20, 50, and 100 cm), starting in summer 2017. The goals of this monitoring network are to aid the development of research applications and situational awareness tools for Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations at Lake Mendocino. We present short analyses of these data to demonstrate their capability to characterize soil moisture responses to precipitation across sites and depths, including time series analysis, correlation analysis, and identification of soil saturation thresholds that induce runoff. Our results show strong inter-site Pearson's correlations (>0.8) at the seasonal timescale. Correlations are strong (>0.8) during events with high antecedent soil moisture and during drydown periods, and weak (<0.5) otherwise. High event runoff ratios are observed when antecedent soil moisture thresholds are exceeded, and when antecedent runoff is high. Although local heterogeneity in soil moisture can limit the utility of point source data in some hydrologic model applications, our analyses indicate three ways in which soil moisture data are valuable for model design: (1) sensors installed at 6 depths per location enable us to identify the soil depth below which evapotranspiration and saturation dynamics change, and therefore choose model soil layer depths, (2) time series analysis indicates the role of soil moisture processes in controlling runoff ratio during precipitation, which hydrologic models should replicate, and (3) spatial correlation analysis of the soil moisture fluctuations helps identify when and where distributed hydrologic modelling may be beneficial.

The optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) have been used to assess the anthropogenic impact on lakes ecology, but their application in comparative assessments of urban lakes has not been attempted. For 2 years, we measured nutrients and CDOM properties in water samples collected from NT and T lakes in the city of Changchun, China. Significant differences in CDOM properties were found between the two types of lakes, and these results were supported by redundancy analysis. The NT lakes were eutrophic while the T lakes were mesotrophic, with mean trophic status index (TSI) of 74.2 and 50.3, respectively. The CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm, a(350), was 2-fold higher in NT than in T lakes (6.59 vs 3.21 m(-1)). In the NT lakes, CDOM components predominantly comprised large molecular weight (MW > 1000-Da) humus-like substances of allochthonous origin, whereas in the T lakes CDOM was dominated by low MW (< 1000-Da) substances from autochthonous production. Seasonal fluctuation has a great influence on the CDOM concentration, but a little influence on its molecular composition. The CDOM concentration were higher in summer than in other seasons. Weather conditions (rainfall, temperature) and biophysical processes (biodegradation, photo-bleaching) likely contributed to these variations. We found the water quality of the treated lakes was getting better from 2016 to 2018. In summary, the study results, not only revealed seasonal effects, but most importantly documented the impact of human activities on the characteristics of CDOM in urban lakes. Most specifically, the sharp difference between the lakes in regard to a(350) (2-fold lower in T than in NT lakes) demonstrated the suitability CDOM absorption coefficient as an early indicator of the impact of treatment measures on the hydrochemistry of DOM in urban lakes.

Indirect versus direct effects of freshwater browning on larval fish foraging	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fish foraging and energy flow between trophic levels are predicted to decline with freshwater browning due to decreased light availability. Studies investigating these predictions have focused on juvenile and adult fishes; however, the larval stage represents a "critical period" in development. We investigated the indirect (i.e., prey availability) versus direct (i.e., visual foraging) effects of browning on zooplankton-larval fish interactions by altering water colour with SuperHume (absorbance at 440 nm = 1.6-10.8 m(-1)). Phytoplankton and zooplankton densities were monitored across treatments for I month to simulate the time leading up to fish spawning in the spring. Larval largemouth bass (Mtcropterus salmon:les) were then introduced to assess indirect effects on fish feeding, growth, and survival. Direct effects on largemouth bass and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) foraging on zooplankton were determined with separate short-term experiments. Browning did not directly alter the ability of larvae to capture prey. However, indirect effects on larval fish foraging, growth, and survival were observed as phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance decreased with increased browning. Our data suggest browning may reduce energy transfer to larval fish due to a reduction in prey but not visual foraging.

Sixty-six teleseismic events with high signal-to-noise ratio were recorded. Travel time and Q analysis of teleseisms characterize an upwarp of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary under Baikal. Theoretical arrival times were calculated by using the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's interior 1991 Earth model, and travel time residuals were found by subtracting computed arrival times from observed ones. A three-dimensional downward projection inversion method is used to invert the P wave velocity structure with constraints from deep seismic sounding data. Our results suggest that (1) the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition upwarps beneath the rift zone, (2) the upwarp has an asymmetric shape, (3) the velocity contrast is -4.9% in the asthenosphere, (4) the density contrast is -0.6%, and (5) the P wave attenuation contrast t* is 0.1 s.

To study the Shandong Province watershed economic development and the relationship between the discharge of pollutants, in this paper, the relationship between economic growth and pollutant emissions in the Shandong Province watershed was established by Shandong Province watershed in 2002-2015 per capita GDP and wastewater, COD, ammonia nitrogen(AN) pollutant emissions. The data were analyzed by software such as SPSS, and the cubic equation model between various pollutants and economic indexes was fitted. To further make the relationship between pollutants and economic development map to study the conventional pollutant emissions and economic development trends. It is found that only the relationship between industrial wastewater discharge and per capita GDP is most coordinated, that is, industrial wastewater emissions with the continuous development of the basin economy, showing a tendency to rise first and then fall. Finally, ultimately based on the results of the study of the water environment and economic development proposals were proposed.

The landslide, occurred on 9th October 1963, involved about 3 x 10(8) m(3) of rock that collapsed in an artificial lake: more than 1900 people died as a consequence of the tsunami produced by the sudden fall of the mass in the water. Despite the importance of this event, many aspects of the Vaiont rockslide still remain unexplained, particularly its fast emplacement. In order to obtain a better understanding of the Vaiont disaster, this paper focuses on the results of analogue models designed to get insights into the internal and surficial deformation patterns that characterized the sliding rock mass. Plan view reconstructions of surface model displacement reveal that the rock mass is subdivided into compartments with different relative movements and differential rotations, believed to have played a significant role in causing the fast collapse. The deformation of the analogue models, compared with geological cross sections and in-situ data, suggests that sliding of the rock mass was accomplished by the development of some new (or the reactivation of pre-existing) fractures into the rock mass.

The water temperature in the epilimnion was high near the shore at Station 1 (17.3 degrees C), probably due to the higher temperature of the river water, and gradually decreased offshore at Station 6 (14.5 degrees C). Thermal stratification developed at Stations 2-6, and a thermocline was observed at a 17-22-m depth at Stations 2-4 and an 8-12-m depth at Stations 5 and 6. The concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in the epilimnion at all stations were < 1.0 mu mol N 1(-1) and < 0.16 mu mol P 1(-1), respectively. Relatively high concentrations of nutrients (0.56-7.38 mu mol N 1(-1) and 0.03-0.28 mu mol P 1(-1)) were detected in the deeper parts of the euphotic zone. Silicate was not exhausted at all stations (> 20 mu mol Si 1(-1)). The chlorophyll a (chl. a) concentration was high (> 10 mu g 1(-1)) near the shore at Station 1 and low (< 3 mu g 1(-1)) at five other stations. The < 2 lm fraction of chl. a in Stations 2-6 ranged between 0.80 and 1.85 mu g 1(-1), and its contribution to total chl. a was high (> 60%). In this fraction, picocyanobacteria were abundant at all stations and ranged between 5 9 10 4 and 5 x 10(5) cells m1(-1). In contrast, chl. a in the > 2 mu m fraction varied significantly (0.14-11.17 mu g 1(-1)), and the highest value was observed at Station 1. In this fraction, the dominant phytoplankton was Aulacoseira and centric diatoms at Station 1 and Cryptomonas, Ankistrodesmus, Asterionella, and Nitzschia at Stations 2-6. The present study demonstrated the dominance of picophytoplankton in the pelagic zone, while higher abundance of phytoplankton dominated by diatoms was observed in the shallower littoral zone. These larger phytoplankters in the littoral zone probably depend on nutrients from the Barguzin River.					katano, toshiya/O-1904-2014; Drucker, Valentin/J-3460-2018; KATANO, Toshiya/O-1904-2014; Nakano, Shin-ichi/M-5483-2016; Tanaka, Yuji/O-1891-2014	katano, toshiya/0000-0001-5184-3065; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2008	9	3					243	250		10.1007/s10201-008-0252-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-008-0252-6													WOS:000260470300008
J	Drake, JM				Drake, JM			Risk analysis for species introductions: forecasting population growth of Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The North American distribution of the Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), an ecologically important and costly invasive fish, is presently limited to the Laurentian Great Lakes. Risk analyses for accidental introductions of ruffe to inland lakes should focus on the chance of establishment for small introductions such as those that would result from transporting ruffe as bait. Here I use Akaike's Information Criterion to select a population growth model for ruffe based on observed population dynamics during the invasion of Loch Lomond, Scotland. This population is regulated by a high carrying capacity and Allee effects were undetected. Parameter estimates obtained from this population forecast that the chance of establishment for possible introductions of ruffe to inland lakes in North America is high. A model for ruffe winter survival suggests that survivorship between introductions and spawning may be an important determinant of establishment success, but that the chance of establishment is high for introductions of only a few individuals. To prevent invasions of ruffe in inland waters, release of ruffe, whether intentional or accidental, should not be tolerated.					; Drake, John/D-6622-2012	Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2005	62	5					1053	1059		10.1139/F05-014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F05-014													WOS:000229594600009

Two acoustic current meters (ACMs) were deployed at 1.8 m and 54 m height from lake bottom respectively, at the observation point with the depth of 90 m near the deepest place (104 m depth). We measured horizontal current velocity, current direction, and water temperature at every 20 minutes, and estimated the bottom stress with horizontal current velocity and water temperature. Average water current velocity near the lake bottom through the observation was weak as reported before, however, maximum current velocity due to strong typhoon in October 2004 reached almost 30 cm/s. Moreover, comparatively strong water current velocity was observed from January to February in each winter. The estimation of the bottom stress with current velocity suggested us that strong currents could re-suspend bottom sediments.																			1340-8054					AUG	2006	49	3					621	625		10.1299/jsmeb.49.621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1299/jsmeb.49.621													WOS:000240710100011
J	Vo, Q; Tran, T				Vo, Quoc; Tran, Tuan			Mediation of lubricated air films using spatially periodic dielectrophoretic effect	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												A stone thrown in a lake captures air as it collides with water and sinks; likewise a rain drop falling on a flat surface traps air bubbles underneath and creates a spectacular splash. These natural occurrences, from bubble entrapment to liquid ejection, happen as air fails to escape from the closing gap between liquid and solid surfaces. Trapping of air is devastating for casting, coating, painting, and printing industries, or those intolerant of water entry noise. Attempts to eliminate the interfering air rely on either reducing the ambient pressure or modifying the solid surfaces. The former approach is inflexible in its implementation, while the latter one is inherently limited by the wetting speed of liquid or the draining capacity of air passages created on the solid. Here, we present a "divide and conquer" approach to split the thin air gap into tunnels and subsequently squeeze air out from the tunnels against its viscous resistance using spatially periodic dielectrophoretic force. We confirm the working principles by demonstrating suppression of both bubble entrapment and splash upon impacts of droplets on solid surfaces. The violent splash of a droplet caused by residual air pockets trapped during impact on a solid surface appears inevitable. Vo and Tran show how to vent the drop on short notice for a smooth touchdown, harnessing dielectrophoretic forces to create dynamic drainage channels.

Bluebills and bayou bivalves: Hurricane-driven trophic cascades affect wintering abundance of Lesser Scaup in Louisiana	ECOSPHERE												The estuaries of coastal Louisiana overwinter a continentally significant proportion of Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis; colloquially, "bluebills"), a migratory bird species of conservation concern since population declines began in the 1980s. Thirty-eight years of aerial waterfowl surveys of Lake Pontchartrain-an oligohaline estuarine lagoon in southeast Louisiana-show that scaup abundance fluctuates between 0 and 1,194,907 birds, though the mechanisms driving this variation are unknown. Previous studies have shown that scaup feed primarily on mollusks, and so changes in the benthic prey community have the potential to strongly influence scaup dynamics on the Lake. Benthic communities are in turn shaped by both natural and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., hurricanes and spillway openings), potentially creating a lagged bottom-up trophic cascade that ultimately affects scaup abundance. Using 22 yr of paired benthic invertebrate and aerial waterfowl survey data, we found scaup populations increased with the abundance of medium-sized Rangia clams (Rangia cuneata) and Dwarf Surf Clams (Mulinia lateralis). Those prey species declined in years when the Lake was hit by a hurricane, but medium-sized Rangia rebounded strongly the year after, likely because storm-surge salinity induces spawning. Using long-term aerial survey data for scaup, we indeed found strong declines on the Lake in years when a hurricane made landfall, but scaup abundance increased the following year, presumably responding to large numbers of medium-sized Rangia. Our three-part analysis makes a strong case for a hurricane-driven bottom-up trophic cascade that affects scaup populations on Lake Pontchartrain. This study adds to a growing literature demonstrating not only that estuaries are tidally and seasonally dynamic, but that punctuated disturbance events can be important for maintaining ecosystem function.

Gut contents of the fish were examined for prey taxa and prey size. Small bloaters (<20 mm) ate Cyclops copepodids almost exclusively. Bloaters between 20 and 35 mm had increasing proportions of Daphnia in their diets as a function of increased body length. Daphnia, especially D. pulicaria, was the most important component in the diets of the largest fish (<35 mm). Larger YOY bloaters preyed selectively on large individuals of D. pulicaria. Abundance of Coregonus increased during 1985 and 1986 subsequent to a decrease in the population of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) in Lake Michigan. Planktivory by bloaters may have been an important selective influence on the summer planktom community in offshore regions of the lake, contributing to a decrease in D. pulicaria.																			0380-1330						1988	14	4					420	426		10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71575-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(88)71575-0													WOS:A1988R673900007

At the century scale, 19 discrete tephra inputs to the lake isolated the sedimentary nutrient supply and shifted the diatom communities to those tolerant of low phosphorus levels, whereas at the millennial scale, diatom-inferred shifts in precipitation-evaporation based on conductivity optima and diatom life-form ratios were broadly similar to lake-level reconstructions from Lake Rukwa, Lake Malawi, and others in the region. Some fluctuations of Lake Massoko are consistent with the precession-driven changes in insolation, but the major climate shifts do not relate directly to orbital forcing of summer insolation south of the equator and show more consistency with records from the equatorial and northern tropics that receive rainfall from the passing of the intertropical convergence zone. Sea surface temperatures are strongly correlated to multimillennial-scale climate patterns over this region of Africa. (C) 2003 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Anaerobic Chemolithotrophic Growth of the Haloalkaliphilic Bacterium Strain MLMS-1 by Disproportionation of Monothioarsenate	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A novel chemolithotrophic metabolism based on a mixed arsenic-sulfur species has been discovered for the anaerobic deltaproteobacterium, strain MLMS-1, a haloalkaliphile isolated from Mono Lake, California, U.S. Strain MLMS-1 is the first reported obligate arsenate-respiring chemoautotroph which grows by coupling arsenate reduction to arsenite with the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate. In that pathway the formation of a mixed arsenicsulfur species was reported. That species was assumed to be monothioarsenite ([(H2AsS)-S-III-O-II(2)](-)), formed as an intermediate by abiotic reaction of arsenite with sulfide. We now report that this species is monothioarsenate ([(HAsS)-S-V-O-II(3)](2-)) as revealed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Monothioarsenate forms by abiotic reaction of arsenite with zerovalent sulfur. Monothioarsenate is kinetically stable under a wide range of pH and redox conditions. However, it was metabolized rapidly by strain MLMS-1 when incubated with arsenate. Incubations using monothioarsenate confirmed that strain MLMS-1 was able to grow (mu = 0.017 h(-1)) on this substrate via a disproportionation reaction by oxidizing the thio-group-sulfur (S-II) to zerovalent sulfur or sulfate while concurrently reducing the central arsenic atom (As-V) to arsenite. Monothioarsenate disproportionation could be widespread in nature beyond the already studied arsenic and sulfide rich hot springs and soda lakes where it was discovered.

J	Pham, T; Lum, K; Lemieux, C				Pham, T; Lum, K; Lemieux, C			Seasonal variation of DDT and its metabolites in the St Lawrence River (Canada) and four of its tributaries	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water samples were collected in the St. Lawrence River and at the mouths of four major tributaries, the Richelieu, the Yamaska, the St. Francois and the Nicolet, between August 1990 and November 1991. Analyses were done for p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDD. In the St. Lawrence River, the highest mean ((x) over bar = 3.02 ng/l) was measured in April, during the period of spring thaw, and concentrations subsequently decreased. The seasonal patterns in the tributaries vary. In April, the two most likely sources of DDT in the St. Lawrence River art the release of atmospherically-derived DDT from snowpack, and inputs from the Great Lakes. In the tributaries, the increase in concentration in April could be attributed to the melting of snowpack, and also to the runoff of contaminated soil particles from the watersheds. Ratios of p,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDE + p,p'-DDD in the tributaries decreased from April to September, indicating an annual cycle of time and temperature dependence on degradation. The same trend was not detected in the St. Lawrence River, which may be attributed to the recent use of dicofol containing DDT as an impurity in the Great Lakes Basin which would 'unbalance' the ratios of p,p'-DDT/transformed DDT. The difference between the ratios of p,p'-DDT/Sigma DDT in marine mammals and in the river suggests that metabolic transformation of p,p'-DDT is occurring faster than the degradation in the aquatic environment and that there are still continuous inputs of p,p'-DDT in the St. Lawrence River Basin.																			0048-9697					JAN 26	1996	179	1-3					17	26		10.1016/0048-9697(95)04869-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(95)04869-3													WOS:A1996TX86400003

Around ca. 7250 cal BP, coinciding with the first settlement phase of La Draga, a rapid fall of the pollen values of deciduous Quercus sp. is observed, and a stabilisation of these values is found until ca. 6000 cal BP. The causes for such changes in vegetation cover are discussed, taking into consideration environmental data to calibrate the role of climate in vegetation dynamics, as well as archaeobotanical data to evaluate impact of the management of vegetal resources on the landscape. The discussion of the data shows that climate could not have been the main cause for the decrease of broadleaf deciduous forests, and that the need of gathering raw material for the construction of dwellings played a major role in this change. The fact that these plant community does not recover during the occupation or after the abandonment of La Draga would confirm that human impact continued over time and that forest clearances were maintained for various purposes.

Seasonal variation of Fe, Mn oxides and organic materials in surface coatings, which were developed periodically on glass slides in Nanhu Lake, Jilin Province, China over the time frame of three seasons, was investigated in order to understand the influence of metal oxides on Pb and Cd adsorption to heterogeneous surface coating materials (biofilm). Pb and Cd adsorption was measured under controlled laboratory conditions( mineral salts solution with defined spediation, ionic strength 0.05 mol/L, 25degreesC and pH 6.0). The classical Langmuir adsorption isotherm was applied to estimate equilibrium coefficients of Pb and Cd adsorption to the surface coatings. In general, components in the surface coatings varied greatly with seasons, altering and obtained higher concentrations in summer while the content of iron oxides always exceeded that of manganese oxides. Correlation analyses between the maximum adsorption of Pb and Cd and components in the surface coatings developed periodically indicated that Pb phase association with Mn oxides and Cd phase association with Fe oxides as well as Mn oxides were statistically significant. Effect of Mn oxides on Cd adsorption was confirmed in view of its higher content in the surface coatings. The importance of ferromanganese oxides for Pb and Cd adsorption to the natural surface coatings developed in different seasons was evidenced.

J	Abramowicz, K; Schelin, L; de Luna, SS; Strandberg, J				Abramowicz, Konrad; Schelin, Lina; de Luna, Sara Sjostedt; Strandberg, Johan			Multiresolution clustering of dependent functional data with application to climate reconstruction	STAT												We propose a new nonparametric clustering method for dependent functional data, the double clustering bagging Voronoi method. It consists of two levels of clustering. Given a spatial lattice of points, a function is observed at each grid point. In the first-level clustering, features of the functional data are clustered. The second-level clustering takes dependence into account, by grouping local representatives, built from the resulting first-level clusters, using a bagging Voronoi strategy. Depending on the distance measure used, features of the functions may be included in the second-step clustering, making the method flexible and general. Combined with the clustering method, a multiresolution approach is proposed that searches for stable clusters at different spatial scales, aiming to capture latent structures. This provides a powerful and computationally efficient tool to cluster dependent functional data at different spatial scales, here illustrated by a simulation study. The introduced methodology is applied to varved lake sediment data, aiming to reconstruct winter climate regimes in northern Sweden at different time resolutions over the past 6,000 years.					de Luna, Sara/G-7901-2016; Abramowicz, Konrad/KHD-8932-2024	Strandberg, Johan/0000-0003-1098-0076; 													2049-1573						2019	8	1							e240	10.1002/sta4.240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sta4.240													WOS:000506857900010

Atmospheric Mercury Temporal Trends in the Northeastern United States from 1992 to 2014: Are Measured Concentrations Responding to Decreasing Regional Emissions?	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												Long-term atmospheric mercury measurements at Underhill, VT (VT99),' and Huntington Forest, NY (NY20), from 1992 to 2014 and 2005 to 2014, respectively, were used to determine concentration trends using Mann Kendall's tau test with Sen's slope estimator. These data, measured generally downwind of large Hg sources in the Midwestern United States, provide the longest record of ambient Hg concentrations available in the United States. At VT99, concentrations of gaseous element mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), and particle-bound mercury (PBM) declined at rates of -1.8, -3.2, and -6.7%/year, respectively. At NY20, GEM and GOM concentrations declined at rates of -1.6 and -7.8%/year, respectively; however, PBM concentrations increased at a rate of 2.0%/year, which is likely related to winter wood burning. A trajectory ensemble analysis using the potential source contribution function indicates the source locations associated with high mercury concentrations changed from Toronto Buffalo and Pennsylvania areas to east coast urban centers. The declining GEM concentrations in the northeastern United States are positively correlated with decreasing SO2 emissions in the upwind area. Overall, the results indicate that decreased mercury concentrations measured during the past decade are consistent with decreased Hg emissions from regional point sources and that increasing global emissions have not overwhelmed those decreases.					; Dvonch, Joseph/K-3632-2013; Cohen, Mark/P-6936-2015; Hopke, Philip/C-6020-2008	zhou, chuanlong/0000-0001-8848-8247; Holsen, Thomas/0000-0001-9599-6733; Cohen, Mark/0000-0003-3183-2558; Hopke, Philip/0000-0003-2367-9661													2328-8930					MAR	2017	4	3					91	97		10.1021/acs.estlett.6b00452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.6b00452													WOS:000396645800003

Late Holocene isotope hydrology of Lake Qinghai, NE Tibetan Plateau: effective moisture variability and atmospheric circulation changes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A sub-centennial-resolution record of lacustrine carbonate oxygen isotopes (delta O-18(C)) from the closed-basin Lake Qinghai on the NE Tibetan Plateau shows pronounced variability over the past 1500 years. Changes in delta O-18(C) in hydrologically closed lakes are often interpreted in terms of changing effective moisture. Under this interpretation our record would imply increasing effective moisture during the Little Ice Age (LIA) compared to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). However, independent evidence from other archives strongly suggests the Asian summer monsoon was stronger during the MWP and weakened during the LIA. Controls other than effective moisture (the balance of water inputs over evaporative loss) must therefore have contributed to the delta O-18(C) values. We propose the LIA signal in Lake Qinghai resulted from a reduction in evaporation caused by colder air temperatures, coupled with a decrease in oxygen isotope composition of input waters as a result of an increase in the relative importance of westerly-derived precipitation. Our results caution against simplistic interpretations of carbonate oxygen isotope records from hydrologically closed lakes and suggest all possible controlling factors must be taken into account in order to avoid misleading palaeoclimatic reconstructions.

Interannual variations in lake ice duration and thickness allow estimates of local climatic variability. In addition, long-term changes in lake ice phenology may provide a robust indication of climatic change. The relationship between lake ice and climate enables the use of process-based models for predicting the dates of freeze-up and thaw. LIMNOS (Lake Ice Model Numerical Operational Simulator) is one such model, which was originally designed to simulate the ice phenology of several lakes in southern Wisconsin. In this study, LIMNOS is modified to run globally on a 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees latitude-longitude grid using average monthly climate data. We initially simulate the ice phenology for lakes of 5- and 20-m mean depths across the northern hemisphere to demonstrate the effects of lake depth, latitude, and elevation on ice phenology. To evaluate the results of LIMNOS we also simulate the ice phenology of 30 lakes across the northern hemisphere which have long-term ice records. LIMNOS reproduces the general geographic patterns of ice-on and ice-off dates, although ice-off dates tend to occur later in the model. Lakes with extreme depths, surface areas, or precipitation are simulated less accurately than small, shallow lakes. This study reveals strengths and weaknesses of LIMNOS and suggests aspects which need improving. Future investigations should focus on the use of geographically extensive lake ice observations and modeling to elucidate patterns of climatic variability and/or climate change.

In the 1st century AD an underground canal was built to prevent it from causing devastating floods. After the initial success, the efficiency of the canal rapidly deteriorated and the ancient lake Surface was restored. In the mid 1800s, the construction of a new underground canal led to the complete disappearance of the lake and to the reclamation of its basin. Thus, an ancient conflict between local communities and a water surplus appeared to be finally solved. However, the initial farm crops, mostly wheat, maize and sugar beet, were progressively replaced with much more profitable horticultural crops, especially over the past 15 years. This change was accompanied by rising demand for water. Consequently, groundwater withdrawal has increased, and flows in streams and from springs have decreased, causing many environmental problems. These problems have to be solved by the application of water science, in terms of scientific knowledge., technical tools and regulatory efforts.

J	Fouilland, E; Mostajir, B				Fouilland, Eric; Mostajir, Behzad			Revisited phytoplanktonic carbon dependency of heterotrophic bacteria in freshwaters, transitional, coastal and oceanic waters	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Positive relationships between heterotrophic bacteria and particulate phytoplankton production (respectively, BP and PPP) have been reported for several areas, suggesting that material produced by phytoplankton was a major substrate for bacterial growth. Since then, thousands of simultaneous measurements of both PPP and BP have been performed. A review of these data showed that BP may exceed PPP considerably (median ranged between 132% and 484%) in all aquatic systems with the lowest PPP. In oceanic waters, BP did not seem to be temporally synchronized with PPP and the median BP : PPP ratio is 15% with moderate PPP, but the immediate bacterial carbon (C) demand (including bacterial respiration) was greater than the corresponding total primary production (i.e. dissolved and particulate primary production) for > 80% of both volumetric and areal datasets. In freshwaters, the strong covariation observed between BP and PPP seemed mainly due to a common response to sudden nutrient inputs into enclosed systems, leading to a similar range of production rates and temporal synchronicities. Indeed, phytoplankton exudates contributed directly to only 32% (median) of BP when C-tracking experiments were performed in freshwaters. Therefore, because direct C dependency of bacteria on phytoplankton is questionable, other C sources might be more significant for bacterial growth.

J	Qin, BQ; Zhang, YL; Zhu, GW; Gao, G				Qin, Boqiang; Zhang, Yunlin; Zhu, Guangwei; Gao, Guang			Eutrophication control of large shallow lakes in China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Large shallow lake refers to a polymictic system that is often well mixed without stratification during summer. Similar to a small and deep lake, a large and shallow lake has a high nutrient retention rate. Differing from a small and deep lake, it has an extensive sediment-water interface and internal loading from sediment, which has led to high susceptibility to eutro-phication. There are many large and shallow freshwater lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River (MLYR), China, ex-perienced eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms. To address this issue, a variety of methods focused on in-lake physical and biogeochemical processes was explored. The main gains of these studies included: (1) shallow lakes in the floodplain of the Yangtze River are prone to eutrophication because of their high trophic conditions; (2) wind-induced waves determine sediment resuspension, downward dissolved oxygen penetration, and upward soluble reactive nutrient mobilization, while wind-driven currents regulate the spatial distribution of water quality metrics and algal blooms; (3) the low P loss of shallow lakes via sedimentation and high N loss via denitrification lead to a low N:P ratio and N and P colimitation, which demonstrated the significance of dual N and P reduction for eutrophication control in shallow lakes; (4) extensive submerged macrophyte could suppress internal loading in large, shallow waters, but nutrient loading must be reduced and water clarity must be increased; and (5) climate warming promotes cyanobacterial blooms through positive feedback to exacerbate eutrophication in shallow lakes. The lack of action to address the challenges of non-point source pollution and internal loading from the sediment has led to limited effectiveness of eutrophication control in large shallow lakes under climate warming. In the future, the management of large shallow eutrophic lakes in China must com-bine social sciences (economic development) with natural technology (pollution reduction) to achieve sustainability.

Transplanting Following Non-Native Plant Control in Rocky Mountain Foothills Fescue Grassland Restoration	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION												Disturbed areas within national parks, resulting from historic and current land use activities, can harbor large and diverse populations of non-native plant species. These species must be controlled to prevent their spread and to restore native grassland. Research on alternative revegetation methods is urgently needed since seed based grassland restoration is often unsuccessful. The effectiveness of transplanting to restore foothills fescue grassland following implementation of non-native plant management was investigated at three disturbed sites in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada. Non-native plant abundance was reduced by cutting, glyphosate application, and steaming. Greenhouse grown seedlings of native fescue grassland species (13 forbs, five grasses, two shrubs) were outplanted into plots following management treatments, as three different sizes of container stock. The effects of prior non-native plant management and container size on transplant survival and growth were assessed over two growing seasons. Rhizomatous forbs and bunchgrasses with well-developed root systems had highest survival (> 50% over 14 months). Transplants with 10- to 15-cm rooting depth in cones and root trainers had significantly higher within-year survival than tray transplants with a shallow rooting depth. Transplant survival was improved by glyphosate application to control non-native plants prior to planting. Transplanting was effective for increasing native cover and species richness although high winter mortality reduced this effect. Key species for fescue grassland function were introduced at all sites and persisted for two growing seasons.

Both diatom- and chrysophyte-inferred pH profiles indicate that the pH of Labelle Lake has remained fairly stable in the past. The study of Labelle and Middle lakes indicates that the addition of nutrients to acidic and non-acidic oligotrophic lakes did not directly influence diatom and chrysophyte species composition, perhaps because pH remained stable. The diatom and chrysophyte assemblages of Middle Lake only changed when the pH was raised. In Mountaintop Lake the recent shift in chrysophyte species composition and the resulting inferred pH declines is most likely related to a decline in mid-summer epilimnetic pH. Reliable paleolimnological inferences are difficult in lakes such as these because it is difficult to track limnological conditions in the absence of modern analogues.

A recent study postulates that Drangajokull on Vestfirair, Iceland, persisted through the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM, 7.9-5.5 ka) and may be a relic from the last glacial period. We test this hypothesis with a suite of sediment cores from threshold lakes both proximal and distal to the ice cap's modern margin. Distal lakes document rapid early Holocene deglaciation from the coast and across the highlands south of the glacier. Sediment from Skorarvath, a lake to the north of Drangajokull, shows that the northern margin of the ice cap reached a size comparable to its contemporary limit by similar to 10.3 ka. Two southeastern lakes with catchments extending well beneath modern Drangajokull confirm that by similar to 9.2 ka, the ice cap was reduced to -20% of its current area. A continuous 10.3ka record.of biological productivity from Skorarvatn's sediment indicates local peak warmth occurred between 9 and 6.9 ka. The combination of warm and dry summers on Vestfirair suggests that Drangajokull very likely melted completely shortly after 9.2 1<a, similar to most other Icelandic ice caps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

During the summers of 1985 and 1986 a gill netting programme in Lough Leane for brown trout, Salmo trutta L., yielded 32 shad (1985) and 64 shad (1986) as a by-catch. These fish were deep frozen and compared with a sample of 59 marine twaite shad, taken on rod and line from St Mullin''s Co. Carlow, which had entered the River Barrow to spawn. Morphometric, meristic and electrophoretic character analyses were carried out on the two populations. The three analyses, particularly the isoelectric focusing, confirmed a high degree of genetic similarity. The two major differences found were the dwarfed size of the Killarney shad and the increased numbers of gill rakers carried on the first branchial arch. The merits and demerits of assigning the term subspecies to the Killarney shad are discussed in the light of the available evidence produced.

J	Stone, T				Stone, T			Last glacial cycle hydrological change at Lake Tyrrell, southeast Australia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Lake Tyrrell is the largest playa in the Murray Basin of southeast Australia. Optical dating of transverse dune (lunette) sediments extends the lake's radiocarbon chronology to the last interglacial period. The highest lake level was attained 131,000 +/- 10,000 yr ago, forming Lake Chillingollah, a megalake that persisted until around 77,000 +/- 4000 yr ago. Pedogenesis of its sandy lunette continued until buried by a silty clay lunette deflated from the lake floor 27,000 +/- 2000 yr ago. The dated soil-stratigraphic units correlate with the upper Tyrrell Beds and contain evidence that humans visited the lakeshore before 27,000 yr ago. The Lake Chillingollah megalake was synchronous with very high lake levels in monsoon-dominated Australia, yet it was not influenced by tropical monsoon systems. It was filled instead by increased winter rainfall from westerly low-pressure fronts. Greater effective precipitation across Australia is evident, the result of a weakened subtropical high-pressure zone. (c) 2006 University of Washington.

J	Fisher, TG; Loope, WL				Fisher, TG; Loope, WL			Aeolian sand preserved in Silver Lake: a new signal of Holocene high stands of Lake Michigan	HOLOCENE												Aeolian sand within lake sediment from Silver Lake, Michigan can be used as a proxy for the timing of high lake levels of Lake Michigan. We demonstrate that the sand record from Silver Lake plotted as percent weight is in-phase with the elevation curve of Lake Michigan since the mid-Holocene Nipissing Phase. Because fluctuations in Lake Michigan's lake level are recorded in beach ridges, and are a response to climate change, the aeolian sand record within Silver Lake is also a proxy for climate change. It appears that increases in dune activity and lake sand are controlled by similar climatic shifts that drive fluctuations in lake level of Lake Michigan. High lake levels destabilize coastal bluffs that drive dune sand instability, and along with greater wintertime storminess, increase niveo-aeolian transport of sand across lake ice. The sand is introduced into the lake each spring as the ice cover melts.

Nitrogen concentrations were higher in the shoot than in the root and rhizome, while P. Ca, Cu, Fe, Zn and ash concentrations were higher in the root than in the rhizome and shoot. Significant differences in the concentrations of Mg, Cd, Cu and ash were assessed during the growing season of T. domingensis. The content of most nutrients and heavy metals in the shoot increased rapidly during the early growing season in February, reached maximal values in July and then decreased again. The nutrient and heavy metal contents in the below-ground portion of the plant showed an opposite trend compared to the shoot; they decreased sharply during the spring, when they were translocated, supporting the heterotrophic phase of shoot growth. However, they increased slightly from July to September and then decreased again. The transfer factors of all nutrients and heavy metals from the sediment to the below-ground organs were greater than unity. The higher translocation ratio of N in T. domingensis shoots makes it suitable for N phytoextraction from water and sediment, while the lower translocation ratios for Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn make it suitable for metal ion phytostabilisation. The dead shoot biomass of the stands at the end of 2010 amounted to 1950g DM m(-2), when the seasonal decomposition process began. With a decay rate of 0.0049 day(-1), 1624g DM m(-2) is decomposed in the lake in a year. This is equivalent to releasing the following nutrient and heavy metals into the surrounding water (in g m(-2)): 23.4 N, 0.8 P. 19.2 Ca, 1.8 Mg, 5.6 Na, 32.8 K, 0.01 Cd, 0.01 Cu, 0.84 Fe, 0.12 Pb and 0.03 Zn.

J	Alexandrowicz, WP				Alexandrowicz, Witold Pawel			Molluscan assemblages in the deposits of landslide dammed lakes as indicators of late Holocene mass movements in the polish Carpathians	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Detailed malacological analyses were performed in calcareous tufas filling landslide dammed lakes within the Polish Carpathians. The composition of molluscan assemblages provided a basis for the reconstruction of sedimentation conditions of deposits and the evolution of a given dammed lake. The age of landslides was determined by radiocarbon dating and four phases of intensification of mass movements in the Polish Carpathians during the Late Holocene were distinguished. They demonstrate connections with the period of cold and wet climate and fall in the following periods: middle part of the Bronze Age (1700-1500 BC), Iron Age (900-700 BC), the beginning of the Little Ice Age (Wolf minimum) (1250-1420 AD) and the coldest phase of the Little Ice Age (Maunder minimum) (1650-1750 AD). These phases correspond closely to the periods with intensified mass movements, involving both landslides and debris flows in other mountain ranges in Europe, stages of glacier advances in the Alps and the Scandinavian Peninsula, and the periods of increased fluvial activities of rivers and elevated water levels in European lakes.

When available on a yearly basis to account for seasonal variability, five structural features have been chosen: species composition, species richness, species dominance, diversity and biomass (total and per taxonomic groups). Despite the high number of reported studies, most of them cover only some of the aforementioned features. As a result of the low amount of studies, tropical rivers are underepresented. No size distribution studies have been carried out on river phytoplankton. The average species richness amounts to 126, being higher in temperate rivers. Roughly one half of each flora is comprised of sporadic species. No statistically significant relationship between species richness and latitude has been found despite the fact that tropical rivers appear to house fewer species than temperate rivers. Also, one half of the support in the floras are either benthic or tychoplanktonic. Diatoms comprise the majority of species numbers in the whole data set but are substituted by desmids in tropical rivers and by green algae when benthic species are not taken into account. There appears to be lower biomass in river phytoplankton than in lakes. Diatoms are also the major taxonomic group comprising total biomass in rivers but they share clearly a lower fraction in tropical rivers. On an average basis, diatoms appear to be more dominant in rivers than in lakes. The time course of diatom dominance occurs close to the summer solstice in tropical rivers whereas is much more lagged in temperate sites. The diversity of river phytoplankton is highly scattered (0.40-4.40 bits ind(-1)).

Response of debris-covered glaciers in the Mount Everest region to recent warming, and implications for outburst flood hazards	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												In areas of high relief, many glaciers have extensive covers of supraglacial debris in their ablation zones, which alters both rates and spatial patterns of melting, with important consequences for glacier response to climate change. Wastage of debris-covered glaciers can be associated with the formation of large moraine-dammed lakes, posing risk of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs). In this paper, we use observations of glaciers in the Mount Everest region to present an integrated view of debris-covered glacier response to climate change, which helps provide a long-term perspective on evolving GLOF risks. In recent decades, debris-covered glaciers in the Everest region have been losing mass at a mean rate of similar to 0.32 m yr(-1), although in most cases there has been little or no change in terminus position. Mass loss occurs by 4 main processes: (1) melting of clean ice close to glacier ELAs; (2) melting beneath surface debris; (3) melting of ice cliffs and calving around the margins of supraglacial ponds; and (4) calving into deep proglacial lakes. Modelling of processes (1) and (2) shows that Everest-region glaciers typically have an inverted ablation gradient in their lower reaches, due to the effects of a down-glacier increase in debris thickness. Mass loss is therefore focused in the mid parts of glacier ablation zones, causing localised surface lowering and a reduction in downglacier surface gradient, which in turn reduce driving stress and glacier velocity, so the lower ablation zones of many glaciers are now stagnant. Model results also indicate that increased summer temperatures have raised the altitude of the rain-snow transition during the summer monsoon period, reducing snow accumulation and ice flux to lower elevations. As downwasting proceeds, formerly efficient supraglacial and englacial drainage networks are broken up, and supraglacial lakes form in hollows on the glacier surface. Ablation rates around supraglacial lakes are typically one or two orders of magnitude greater than sub-debris melt rates, so extensive lake formation accelerates overall rates of ice loss. Most supraglacial lakes are 'perched' above hydrological base level, and are susceptible to drainage if they become connected to the englacial drainage system. Speleological surveys of conduits show that large englacial voids can be created by drainage of warm lake waters along pre-existing weaknesses in the ice. Roof collapses can open these voids up to the surface, and commonly provide the nuclei of new lakes. Thus, by influencing both lake drainage and formation, englacial conduits exert a strong control on surface ablation rates. An important threshold is crossed when downwasting glacier surfaces intersect the hydrological base level of the glacier. Base-level lakes formed behind intact moraine dams can grow monotonically, and in some cases can pose serious GLOF hazards. Glacier termini can evolve in different ways in response to the same climatic forcing, so that potentially hazardous lakes will form in some situations but not others. Additionally, the probability of a flood is not simply a function of lake volume, but depends on the geometry and structure of the dam, and possible trigger mechanisms such as ice- or rockfalls into the lake. Satellite-based measurements of glacier surface gradient and ice velocities allow probable future locations of base-level lakes to be identified. A base-level lake has begun to grow rapidly on Ngozumpa Glacier west of Mount Everest, and could attain a volume of similar to 10(8) m(3) within the next 2 or 3 decades. Unless mitigation efforts are undertaken, this lake could pose considerable GUN hazard potential. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The rehabilitation of this species will be aided by identifying nursery habitats in riverine environments through characterizing the habitat use and movements of age-0 fish. The objectives of this study were to determine the habitat preferences and movement patterns of age-0 lake sturgeon in the lower Peshtigo River, Wisconsin, a tributary of Lake Michigan. Fish were captured from June through October 2002 and 2003 by means of wading, snorkeling, haul-seine, and backpack electrofishing surveys, and radio transmitters were attached to individuals larger than 74 g. For each capture and relocation site, habitat features were evaluated by measuring water depth, velocity, and temperature and by characterizing substrate type and macroinvertebrate assemblage. Age-0 lake sturgeon were collected and relocated at water depths less than 2 to over sand substrates and at current velocities less than 0.60 m/s. Capture and relocation sites were dominated by dipteran larvae, and the median macroinvertebrate density was lower at these sites than in the remainder of the study area. Macroinvertebrate diversity index values were also lower at capture sites than in the overall study area. Daily movements of age-0 lake sturgeon showed that fish exhibited greater activity after dark, whereas seasonal movement patterns were related to changes in water temperature, particularly during fall months as fish moved from the river to Green Bay. These results suggest that shallow, riverine areas with sand substrates, low current velocity, and a predominance of dipteran larvae should be protected as important nursery habitats in Great Lakes tributaries that support spawning populations of lake sturgeon.

PLOS ONE												Settlement crises in ancient cultures of Western Asia are commonly thought to be caused by climatic events such as severe droughts. However, the insufficient climate proxy situation in this region challenges the inference of clear relationships between climate and settlement dynamics. We investigate the Holocene climatic changes on the Varamin Plain in the context of the climatic history of Western Central Asia by using a transient comprehensive Earth System Model simulation (8 ka BP to pre-industrial), a high-resolution regional snapshot simulation and a synthesis of pollen-based climate reconstructions. In line with the reconstructions, the models reveal only slightly varying mean climatic conditions on the Varamin Plain but indicate substantial changes in seasonality during the Holocene. Increased precipitation during spring, combined with lower temperature and potentially stronger snow accumulation on the upstream Alborz mountains may have led to an increased water supply on the alluvial fan during the vegetation period and thus to more favourable conditions for agricultural production during the Mid-Holocene compared to modern times. According to the model, dry periods on the Central Iranian Plateau are related to particularly weak Westerly winds, fostering the subsidence in the mid-troposphere and hampering precipitation over the region. The model reveals that dry periods have spatially heterogenous manifestations, thus explaining why they do not appear in all proxy records in the wider study region. In fact, the climatic signal may depend on local environmental conditions. The interaction of the topography with the atmospheric circulation leads to additional spatial heterogeneity. Although our results provide several indications for a connection between climate and settlement dynamics, the small overall changes in moisture call into question whether climate is the main driver for settlement discontinuities on the Central Iranian Plateau. To shed further light on this issue, more high-resolution long-term proxy records are needed.					; Kirsten, Fabian/ABG-0139-2022	Schutt, Brigitta/0000-0001-5644-9104; Dallmeyer, Anne/0000-0002-3270-610X; Kirsten, Fabian/0000-0002-4813-3713; Busch, Robert/0000-0002-6079-7926													1932-6203					OCT 31	2023	18	10							e0290181	10.1371/journal.pone.0290181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0290181								37906582					WOS:001099905400006

We present the first study of dissolved CH4 distributions and lake-air flux from Lake Winnipeg, based on two-years of observations collected during all seasons. Methane concentrations across two years had a median of value of 24.6 nmol L-1 (mean: 41.6 +/- 68.2 nmol L-1) and ranged between 5.0 and 733.8 nmol L-1, with a 2018 annual median of 24.4 nmol L-1 (mean: 46. 8 +/- 99.3 nmol L-1) and 25.1 nmol L-1 (mean: 38.8 +/- 45.2 nmol L-1) in 2019. The median lake-air flux was 1.1 gmol m-2 h-1 (range: 0.46-70.1 gmol m-2h-1, mean: 2.9 +/- 10.2 gmol m-2 h-1) in 2018, and 5.5 gmol m-2h-1 (range: 0.0-78.4 gmol m-2 h-1, mean: 2.7 +/- 8.5 gmol m-2 h-1) in 2019, for a total diffusive emission of 0.001 Tg of CH4-C yr-1. We found evidence of consistent spatial variability, with higher concentrations near river inflows. Significant seasonal trends in CH4 concentrations were not observed, though fluxes were highest during the fall season due to strong winds. Our findings suggest Lake Winnipeg is a CH4 source of similar mean magnitude to Lake Erie, with lower concentrations and fluxes per unit area than smaller mid- to high-latitude lakes. Additional work is needed to understand the factors underlying observed spatial variability in dissolved gas concentration, including estimations of production and consumption rates in the water column and sediments.

To investigate how these diatom assemblages are altered during sediment formation, quantitative plankton monitoring (1995-1998) was integrated with sediment trapping over 2 yr (1996-1997) in Baikal's southern basin (depth similar to1,400 m). The traps consisted of both open (similar to6 monthly) and sequential (similar to2 weekly) collectors deployed throughout the water column. Sedimentation was seasonal, with diatom species. composition, valve abundance, and total dry mass reflecting changes in-the planktonic communities. Sedimented assemblages were transmitted largely intact to the deepest traps (similar to1,300 1,390 m); some compositional blurring occurred from differential sinking rates and dissolution of diatom valves. A rapid mass flux event of Aulacoseira skvortzowii and A. baicalensis was recorded in summer 1997 with particle sinking rates between 60 and 100 m d(-1) and dry mass fluxes >5 g m(-2) d(-1). Although dissolution was evident for all species, more delicate taxa were preferentially affected (e.g., A. skvortzowii vegetative cells and fine Synedra species), whereas Nitzschia acicularis valves. were almost entirely dissolved within the water column. Comparing trap and plankton diatom assemblages with those in nearby core tops demonstrated that a fundamental taphonomic change occurs in the surface sediment, with sedimentary diatom accumulation rates being only about 1% of trap deposition and plankton production rates. Dissolution-was significant in explaining 5-30% of species variance between all taphonomic levels (plankton, trap samples and surface sediments). Results indicate that diatom-based paleoclimatic. records in Lake Baikal sediments could be improved and refined by taking taphonomic considerations into account.

Here, we focus on the endangered Saimaa ringed seal (Pusa hispida saimensis), which lives in close connection with humans in Lake Saimaa, Finland. This unique endemic population has remained landlocked since the last glacial period, and it currently consists of only similar to 400 individuals. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the Saimaa ringed seal, identify the main risk factors and discuss the efficacy of conservation actions put in place to ensure its long-term survival. The main threats for this rare subspecies are bycatch mortality, habitat destruction and increasingly mild winters. Climate change, together with small population size and an extremely impoverished gene pool, forms a new severe threat. The main conservation actions and priorities for the Saimaa ringed seal are implementation of fishing closures, land-use planning, protected areas, and reduction of pup mortality. Novel innovations, such as provisioning of artificial nest structures, may become increasingly important in the future. Although the Saimaa ringed seal still faces the risk of extinction, the current positive trend in the number of seals shows that endangered wildlife populations can recover even in regions with considerable human inhabitation, when legislative protection is combined with intensive research, engagement of local inhabitants, and innovative conservation actions. Such multifaceted conservation approaches are needed in a world with a growing human population and a rapidly changing climate.																			0006-3207	1873-2917				JAN	2021	253								108908	10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108908	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108908													WOS:000611987900001

Four hypotheses concerning the effects of stock size and water temperature on growth and recruitment were tested statistically. The number of recruits per spawner was not a function of parental stock size, but was dependent on surface-water temperatures in June and July. although the size of both males and females at age 3 yr was positively related to surface-water temperatures in the three preceding summers, growth rates were only a function of water temperatures during the second year of growth (age 1). However, growth rates during the first, second, and third years of growth were all related to year-class strength. Thus, population abundance, through recruitment, was determined by an abiotic factor (water temperature), but growth was mostly affected by intraspecific competition for, presumably, food.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	10					1608	1613		10.1139/f85-201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-201													WOS:A1985ASS5100005
J	Koch, JC				Koch, Joshua C.			Lateral and subsurface flows impact arctic coastal plain lake water budgets	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Arctic thaw lakes are an important source of water for aquatic ecosystems, wildlife, and humans. Many recent studies have observed changes in Arctic surface waters related to climate warming and permafrost thaw; however, explaining the trends and predicting future responses to warming is difficult without a stronger fundamental understanding of Arctic lake water budgets. By measuring and simulating surface and subsurface hydrologic fluxes, this work quantified the water budgets of three lakes with varying levels of seasonal drainage, and tested the hypothesis that lateral and subsurface flows are a major component of the post-snowmelt water budgets. A water budget focused only on post-snowmelt surface water fluxes (stream discharge, precipitation, and evaporation) could not close the budget for two of three lakes, even when uncertainty in input parameters was rigorously considered using a Monte Carlo approach. The water budgets indicated large, positive residuals, consistent with up to 70% of mid-summer inflows entering lakes from lateral fluxes. Lateral inflows and outflows were simulated based on three processes; supra-permafrost subsurface inflows from basin-edge polygonal ground, and exchange between seasonally drained lakes and their drained margins through runoff and evapotranspiration. Measurements and simulations indicate that rapid subsurface flow through highly conductive flowpaths in the polygonal ground can explain the majority of the inflow. Drained lakes were hydrologically connected to marshy areas on the lake margins, receiving water from runoff following precipitation and losing up to 38% of lake efflux to drained margin evapotranspiration. Lateral fluxes can be a major part of Arctic thaw lake water budgets and a major control on summertime lake water levels. Incorporating these dynamics into models will improve our ability to predict lake volume changes, solute fluxes, and habitat availability in the changing Arctic. Published 2016.

J	Gaudard, A; Wüest, A; Schmid, M				Gaudard, Adrien; Wuest, Alfred; Schmid, Martin			Using lakes and rivers for extraction and disposal of heat: Estimate of regional potentials	RENEWABLE ENERGY												There is increasing interest in using waterbodies as renewable energy sources to heat and cool buildings and infrastructure. Here, we estimate the potentials for heat extraction and disposal for the main lakes and rivers of Switzerland based on acceptable temperature changes in the waterbodies, and compare them to regional demands. In most cases, the potentials considerably exceed the demand, and minor impacts on the thermal regime of the waterbodies are expected. There are, however, critical situations: rivers crossing densely-populated areas, where demand often exceeds the potential, and heat disposal in summer into lowland rivers and shallow lakes, where temperatures may exceed ecological criteria. To assess the impacts of a realistic thermal use, we model the temperature effects in two lakes: Upper Lake Constance, a large lake with relatively low population density, and Lower Lake Zurich, a smaller lake with high regional demand. The estimated mean temperature alterations are -0.05 to +0.02 degrees C for Lake Constance, and -0.60 to +0.22 degrees C for Lake Zurich. Based on the model results, we discuss the effects of operating parameters on the efficiency and impacts of thermal use.

J	Bird, BW; Kirby, ME				Bird, BW; Kirby, ME			An alpine lacustrine record of early Holocene North American Monsoon dynamics from Dry Lake, southern California (USA)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Dry Lake (2763 m), located in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, USA, provides a high-resolution climate record from the coastal southwest depicting early Holocene terrestrial climate. 27 AMS C-14 dates and multi-proxy analyses, including magnetic susceptibility, total organic mater, microfossil counts, and grain size, suggest the early Holocene was significantly wetter then present, due to an enhanced North American Monsoon (NAM). Elevated insolation at 9000 cal year B.P., raised summer sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of California and the eastern tropical Pacific, as well as land surface temperatures, extending the NAM into southern California. The data also provide evidence of the 8.2 ka event, which registers as a 300-year cool period characterized by reduced monsoonal precipitation, depressed basin productivity, and increased erosion. We suggest this event is the most likely period for the early to middle Holocene (9000-5000 cal year B.P.) glacial advance in the San Bernardino Mountains proposed by Owen et al. (2003, Geology 31: 729-732).																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2006	35	1					179	192		10.1007/s10933-005-8514-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-8514-3													WOS:000233939300012
J	Ryan, WBF; Major, CO; Lericolais, G; Goldstein, SL				Ryan, WBF; Major, CO; Lericolais, G; Goldstein, SL			Catastrophic flooding of the Black Sea	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES												Decades of seabed mapping, reflection profiling, and seabed sampling reveal that throughout the past two million years the Black Sea was predominantly a freshwater lake interrupted only briefly by saltwater invasions coincident with global sea level highstand. When the exterior ocean lay below the relatively shallow sill of the Bosporus outlet, the Black Sea operated in two modes. As in the neighboring Caspian Sea, a cold climate mode corresponded with an expanded lake and a warm climate mode with a shrunken lake. Thus, during much of the cold glacial Quaternary, the expanded Black Sea's lake spilled into to the Marmara Sea and from there to the Mediterranean. However, in the warm climate mode, after receiving a vast volume of ice sheet meltwater, the shoreline of the shrinking lake contracted to the outer shelf and on a few occasions even beyond the shelf edge. If the confluence of a falling interior lake and a rising global ocean persisted to the moment when the rising ocean penetrated across the dividing sill, it would set the stage for catastrophic flooding. Although recently challenged, the flood hypothesis for the connecting event best fits the full set of observations.					; Lericolais, Gilles/AAX-1662-2021	Goldstein, Steven L/0000-0001-7252-8064; Ryan, William B F/0000-0002-9447-6610; Lericolais, Gilles/0000-0002-8159-9187													0084-6597	1545-4495					2003	31						525	554		10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141249													WOS:000185093700015

Phototrophic bacteria are known to react by phototaxis and chemotaxis to changes in the environmental factors light, oxygen or hydrogen sulfide. To determine whether this bacterial plume undergoes diel changes in depth and density, a series of absorption and temperature sensors were positioned vertically and horizontally in this layer, allowing changes in local cell concentration and bacterial movement to be followed with high spatial and temporal resolution. The signals from the absorption sensors were proportional to the cell concentrations in the light path. In the lake, the cell concentration in the bacterial layer was highly dynamic and showed oscillations of various frequencies. The width of the bacterial layer and its depth in the water column varied also. Many of these oscillations were a consequence of internal waves and seiches induced by the frequent alpine winds and the morphology of the lake bed. Parallel to fluctuations in cell concentrations, changes in temperature were monitored. This allowed us to distinguish between physically induced displacements of the cells in the water body and the active movement of bacteria due to changes in light conditions and chemical gradients in the water column. Maximum active vertical movements observed during the daytime were about 25 cm. However, diurnal active vertical bacterial movement was not always found throughout the summer season, possibly due to the particular weather situation and to seasonal changes in bacterial community structure.					; Gerß, Joachim/B-5702-2013	Egli, Konrad/0000-0003-3029-4428; 													0948-3055	1616-1564				APR 28	2004	35	2					105	113		10.3354/ame035105	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame035105													WOS:000221603500001
J	HURLEY, JP; ARMSTRONG, DE				HURLEY, JP; ARMSTRONG, DE			FLUXES AND TRANSFORMATIONS OF AQUATIC PIGMENTS IN LAKE MENDOTA, WISCONSIN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Concentrations of fluxes of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments were measured in suspended and settling particulate matter and in surface sediments in Lake Mendota. Flux comparisons were used to calculate the extent of alteration or degradation within the water column and at the sediment surface. Losses within the water column for specific time intervals ranged from almost negligible for diatoxanthin to 96% for peridinin. The extent of loss was influenced by pigment type and transport process. Surface sediment diagenesis in Lake Mendota resulted in differential degradation rates among chlorophyll and carotenoid constituents. Deposition of heophorbide a-a grazing indicator-was most important during late spring, as zooplankton populations increased and chlorophyll levels in the water column dropped below 1 nmol liter-1. The ability to trace the magnitude of this annual event through the sedimentary record was obscured by selective degradation of pheophorbide relative to chlorophyll and pheophytin. Similarly, carotenoid composition was dramatically altered both within the water column and at the sediment surface. Fucoxanthin and peridinin, major water-column carotenoids, were degraded extensively before incorporation in the sediments.

The effect of growing season length and water level fluctuations on growth and survival of two rare and at risk Atlantic Coastal Plain flora species, Coreopsis rosea and Hydrocotyle umbellata	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												This study examined variables that may be limiting rare species of Nova Scotia's Coastal Plain flora to determine why they have not expanded to other lakeshores, including dam reservoirs with appropriate slope and substrate, and to determine how reservoir management could improve habitat quality. A transplant experiment was conducted to examine whether variables related to growing season (establishment time, position on shoreline, and water-level fluctuation) were limiting two at-risk species, Coreopsis rosea Nutt. (Pink Tickseed) and Hydrocotyle umbellata L. (Water-pennywort). Establishment time as well as timing and duration of flooding were found to limit both species. Unseasonable flooding and later establishment had similar effects in reducing biomass. The contribution of time spent above water to the final biomass was 2-3.4 times greater than time spent below water. At reservoirs, earlier spring draw down would reduce flood stress, while opening the dam during periods of high precipitation would avoid plant damage due to unseasonable flooding. Exposure of the lower shoreline for 49-71 d or greater would benefit H. umbellata, and exposure of the upper shoreline for 100-112 d or greater would benefit C. rosea. To conserve current habitat, we must also minimize disturbances to watersheds affecting natural fluctuations of occupied lakes.																			0008-4026					FEB	2007	85	2					119	131		10.1139/b06-158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b06-158													WOS:000247094000001

Agnes			Twenty-eight years of hydrodynamic variability in the Bay of Quinte (ice-free periods of 1979-2006)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A three-dimensional finite volume numerical model was implemented for the Bay of Quinte, an embayment on the northern side of Lake Ontario, Canada, for the years 1979-2006 to illustrate the seasonal evolution of the bay's circulation and water properties at fine spatial resolutions. The three-dimensional hydrodynamics was simulated for the average ice-free period of April 14 to December 7 of each year and the model was forced using meteorological data from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) dataset. Model results were validated against observed temperature profiles from 1980, 2003, and 2004; bi-weekly summer surface temperatures from 1979 to 2006; and observed flow structures near Glenora in 1976 and 1978. Replacing the NARR meteorological data with local observations lead to an improved temperature estimation for 2004. The water in the bay was found to be warming at a rate of 0.02 +/- 0.01 degrees C/yr. The number of times per year the main channel of the bay can flush is about 4 times per year and can increase up to 20 times per year at the head. These values are generally regulated by the accumulative river inflows and are not only interannually and seasonally variable but also are spatially variable across the bay. The number of times the bay would flush per year was parameterized as a function of mean annual river discharge, showing that in the absence of wind, a minimum annual Trent river (the largest river in the bay) discharge of 64 m(3)/s is required to flush out the head of the bay at least once a year.

Our results show that a deep (>38 m above modem lake level) lake persisted from no later than 28 ka to 19 ka, with the deepest lake phase from 27 to 22 ka. No evidence of highstands is found after 19 ka until the lake rose briefly in the last millennia to 12 m above the modern lake, before regressing to present levels. Laguna Cari-Laufquen broadly matches other regional records in showing last glacial maximum (LGM) highstands, but contrasts with sub-tropical lake records in South America where the hydrologic maximum occurred during deglaciation (17-10 ka). Our lake record from Cari-Laufquen mimics that of high-latitude records from the Northern Hemisphere. This points to a common cause for lake expansions, likely involving some combination of temperature depression and intensification of storminess in the westerlies belt of both hemispheres during the LGM.

The copepods were exposed to solar radiation at the water-surface for similar to 24-34 h. Long-pass cut-off filters (Schott) were used in the exposure experiments, UV radiation and PAR were measured with an IL-1700 (International Light inc.) and a PUV-500 radiometer (Biospherical Instruments Inc.), A biological weighting function for UV-induced mortality was calculated by fitting a model based on a logistic curve. Our results show that UV damage in this species is strongly wavelength- and dose-dependent. B. gracilipes was highly vulnerable to both UV-B (290-320 nm) and UV-A radiation (<360 nm). The shape of the BWF obtained for B. gracilipes resembles more closely the action spectra (AS)dagger for UV-induced erythema, than the AS for naked DNA.

J	Fitzsimons, JD; Brown, SB; Honeyfield, DC; Hnath, JG				Fitzsimons, JD; Brown, SB; Honeyfield, DC; Hnath, JG			A review of early mortality syndrome (EMS) in great lakes salmonids: Relationship with thiamine deficiency	AMBIO												Early mortality syndrome or EMS that affects salmonids in the Great Lakes exhibits many of the same clinical signs as Cayuga syndrome, that affects Atlantic salmon (Salmo. salar) in the New York Finger Lakes and the M74 syndrome that affects Atlantic salmon from the Baltic Sea. These similarities may reflect their shared characteristics of associated low thiamine concentrations in eggs and therapeutic responsiveness to exogenous thiamine treatment. When egg thiamine levels fall below a species-specific threshold clinical signs include loss of equilibrium, depression of respiration and reduced heart rate. Although feeding studies with thiamine deficient diets have yet to confirm a thiamine cause-effect relationship, EMS-like symptoms can be induced with thiamine antagonists. Patterns of temporal variability of EMS among Great Lakes' salmonids over the last 3 decades have been similar. In coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), EMS was negatively correlated with alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) abundance in Lake Michigan. We hypothesize that this may reflect quantitative or qualitative changes in the alewives eaten because despite their fluctuating abundance they have remained the preferred diet item. The limited data available for other salmonids suggest similar trends.																			0044-7447					FEB	1999	28	1					9	15																WOS:000079310000002
J	Grotjahn, R; Huynh, J				Grotjahn, Richard; Huynh, Jonathan			Contiguous US summer maximum temperature and heat stress trends in CRU and NOAA Climate Division data plus comparisons to reanalyses	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Warming is a major climate change concern, but the impact of high maximum temperatures depends upon the air's moisture content. Trends in maximum summertime temperature, moisture, and heat index are tracked over three time periods: 1900-2011, 1950-2011, and 1979-2011; these trends differ notably from annual temperature trends. Trends are emphasized from two CRU datasets (CRUTS3.25 and CRUTS4.01) and two reanalyses (ERA-20C and 20CRv2). Maximum temperature trends tend towards warming that is stronger over the Great Lakes, the interior western and the northeastern contiguous United States. A warming hole in the Midwest generally decreases in size and magnitude when heat stress trends are calculated because the region has increasing moisture. CRU and nearly all reanalyses find cooling in the northern high plains that is not found in NOAA Climate Division trends. These NOAA trends are captured better by CRUTS401. Moistening in the northeast amplifies the heat stress there. Elsewhere the moisture trends are less clear. Drying over northern Texas (after 1996) in CRUTS401 translates into decreasing heat stress there (less so in CRUTS325). Though other reanalyses are not intended for long-term trends, MERRA-2 and ERA-Interim match observed trends better than other reanalyses.

Sediment mobilization deposits from episodic subsurface fluid flow-A new tool to reveal long-term earthquake records?	GEOLOGY												Subsurface fluid flow can be affected by earthquakes; increased spring activity, mud volcano eruptions, groundwater fluctuations, changes in geyser frequency, and other forms of altered subsurface fluid flow have been documented during, after, or even prior to seismic shaking. Recently discovered giant pockmarks on the bottom of Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland, are the lake-floor expression of subsurface fluid flow. They discharge groundwater from the Jura Mountains karstic aquifers and experience episodically increased subsurface fluid flow documented by subsurface sediment mobilization deposits at the levees of the pockmarks. In this study, we present the spatio-temporal distribution of event deposits from these phases of sediment expulsion and of multiple time-correlative mass-transport deposits. We report five striking instances of concurrent multiple subsurface sediment deposits and multiple mass-transport deposits since late glacial times, for which we propose past earthquakes as a trigger. Comparison of this new event catalogue with historic earthquakes and other independent paleoseismic records suggests that initiation of sediment expulsion requires a minimum macroseismic intensity of VII. Thus, our study presents for the first time sedimentary deposits resulting from increased subsurface fluid flow as a paleoseismic proxy.

J	An, KG; Jones, JR				An, KG; Jones, JR			Temporal and spatial patterns in salinity and suspended solids in a reservoir influenced by the Asian monsoon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Between April 1993 and November 1994, conductivity, cations, anions and suspended solids were measured at multiple sites in Taechung Reservoir, Korea. The major mechanism regulating ionic composition was dilution by monsoon rain and a resulting interflow current; these forces caused marked spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Ionic dilution was most pronounced in the headwaters during an intense monsoon in 1993 and was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of Na+ and Cl-, presumably from rainwater. A decrease of > 25% in conductivity and cations occurred during summer 1993 at the plunge-point due to a temperature difference between the lake water and an interflow. In contrast, the 1994 monsoon was weak, ionic dilution was not apparent, and spatial-temporal variation was modest. Overall reservoir salinity was a direct function of water residence time which is regulated by monsoon intensity. Differences in hydrology between years also influenced seston composition; inorganic suspended solids dominated total suspended solids in 1993, but in 1994 the organic fraction was the major component.

J	Wilcox, DA; Buckler, K; Czayka, A				Wilcox, Douglas A.; Buckler, Kathleen; Czayka, Alex			Controlling Cattail Invasion in Sedge/Grass Meadows	WETLANDS												As a result of water-level regulation, cattails have invaded sedge/grass meadow in all wetlands on Lake Ontario. Even with a change in water-level-regulation to a more natural hydrologic regime, restoration requires methods for active cattail management without the ability to manipulate water depths and without imperiling other vegetation. We conducted replicated studies at a wetland site with an active invasion front in zones of nearly mono-dominant cattail and transitional invasion. We tested various combinations of cutting cattail ramets when carbohydrate reserves were minimized, spraying cut stems with herbicide, slicing rhizomes to mimic tilling, and hand-wicking resprouted ramets with herbicide. We also collected companion environmental data. The most effective treatment in both zones was cutting during the period with reduced rhizome carbohydrates followed by hand-wicking resprouted ramets with herbicide in late summer, which allows the herbicide to be absorbed by the rhizomes. Two years of treatment provide the best results, reducing cattail stem counts and cover by more than 50%, but follow-up applications in ensuing years may be warranted to treat surviving cattails. Given the widespread problem of cattail invasion, these treatments may have broad application in wetlands where water levels cannot be manipulated.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2018	38	2					337	347		10.1007/s13157-017-0971-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-017-0971-8													WOS:000433580400012
J	Gedl, P				Gedl, Przemyslaw			Palynology of Late Pleistocene varved clays from ice-dammed lakes at Lebork and Zlocieniec (north-western Poland) - preliminary results	GEOLOGOS												Samples collected from Late Pleistocene varved clays of the Vistulian (Weichselian) glaciation exposed at Lebork and Zlocieniec (Gardno and Pomeranian phases, respectively) yielded palynological contents that are related to the different lithologies composing the varves. The dark-coloured clay units contain very small amounts of palynological material. The lighter-coloured, much thicker coarser units yielded large amounts of organic particles consisting of predominantly palynodebris of terrestrial plants, sporomorphs and aquatic palynomorphs. The latter include fresh-water and marine phytoplankton.. All particles were presumably washed out from the pre-Quaternary basement or from erratic material. This is indicated by the dinoflagellate-cyst assemblages, which represent Cretaceous and Palaeogene taxa. The large amounts of organic particles in the light-coloured layers indicate high-energy meltwaters streams, which washed them out, transported them and deposited them in ice-dammed lakes. The barren layers and those with lower amounts of organic particles were deposited during calm, presumably winter, periods, when the energy of the meltwater streams was much lower.																			1426-8981	2080-6574				APR	2011	17	1					49	59		10.2478/v10118-011-0004-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10118-011-0004-7													WOS:000434899500004
B	Jellyman, DJ; Gehrke, PC; Harris, JH		Craig, JF		Jellyman, Donald J.; Gehrke, Peter C.; Harris, John H.			Freshwater fisheries of Australasia	FRESHWATER FISHERIES ECOLOGY												Australasia (Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea) contrast markedly in size, climate and the diversity of freshwater fishes. Although Australia is the largest landmass, it has a smaller native fish community (256 species) than Papua New Guinea (PNG) (340 species), while New Zealand has 38 species. Aquaculture in all three countries is mainly based on introduced species (Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in Australia, Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in New Zealand and tilapia Oreochromis spp. and common carp Cyprinus carpio in PNG). While there are small, modest commercial fisheries for native species in all countries, there are also important customary fisheries by indigenous people. Australia supports significant freshwater fisheries resources, comprising both finfish and invertebrate species. Fisheries have long played key cultural and dietary roles for Aboriginal communities. Fisheries differ across the country, with endemic, high-value finfish in the south-east's Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). In the north and north-east, commercial fisheries exploit silver barramundi Lates calcarifer. Eels are also harvested from south-eastern coastal rivers. Recreational fishing has progressively displaced commercial harvesting of finfish around the country, particularly in the east. Widespread river impoundment created expansive artificial habitats that are routinely stocked with fish propagated for angling, and favoured species are often protected from marketing. Aquaculture production is focused on a few high-value table species, together with native and salmonid angling species destined for stocking in recreational fisheries, and conservation programmes for threatened species. Alien species contribute to production; five salmonids support recreational and commercial fisheries, while C. carpio and perch Perca fluviatilis are also exploited in some areas. Alien fishes generate substantial ecological changes in Australian fresh waters. Extensive declines have been documented among most freshwater resources, particularly in the MDB, where finfish populations have fallen to c. 10% of pre-European levels. Many species are threatened. Catchment and habitat changes following agricultural development, species invasions, overexploitation and obstruction of migration pathways by innumerable dams and weirs have all been implicated. In contrast to Australia where extensive areas are arid or semi-arid, New Zealand has generally abundant rainfall, but steep topography results in rapid runoff. Half the native fish fauna are diadromous, maintaining some connection with the sea. Two thirds of native species are threatened in some way, and one species is extinct. The customary (Maori) fishery is largely focused on freshwater eels, and there are areas set aside for exclusive customary fishing. Likewise, commercial fishing is focused on eels (c. 500 t year(-1)); although smaller catches of mullet (mugilids) and flounders Rhombosolea spp. are made, all these species are managed within the Quota Management System whereby fishers are allocated annual catch entitlements. The main recreational fishery for native fishes is for juvenile galaxiids (whitebait) at river mouths in spring. New Zealand, however, is renowned for its wild trout fishing (usually brown trout Salmo trutta in rivers and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in lakes). Farming of trout is not allowed in New Zealand, but there is a growing farming industry for O. tshawytscha, mainly in sea pens but also in large nets in hydro canals. Many rivers have minimum flows and maximum abstractions set to protect environmental, recreational and cultural values. Substantial increases in dairying over the past two decades have resulted in increasing demands for water, often resulting in increased nutrient loads to surface and groundwaters. Predicted effects of climate change are to exacerbate existing conditions with presently wet areas becoming wetter and dry areas drier. Native fishes will show more resilience to such changes than introduced species. PNG has a wet tropical climate, and rainfall is not strongly seasonal. The lowland reaches of rivers are low gradient and turbid and support a high diversity of fish species, many of which are migratory within fresh water or require access to the sea. PNG is the largest producer of freshwater fishes in Australasia, with an estimated production of 17,500 t year(-1). Lates calcarifer are the most economically important species; the fishery collapsed in the 1990s due to the combined effects of mining and overfishing but is now recovering. River herring Nematalosa papuensis, several catfish species and tropical snappers are also important harvested species. Fishing is mainly a subsistence activity carried out by women and children, and freshwater fishes are the main source of protein to people in inland areas. Of the 25 introduced fishes, three tilapia species and C. carpio provide the basis for extensive but small-scale aquaculture. There is growing concern about the impacts of introduced species on the native fish biodiversity, while poorly managed mining, forestry and agriculture have led to declining fish stocks in some rivers. Management strategies need to involve increased engagement of these industries while supporting the use of traditional customs to manage local fisheries.																					978-1-118-39440-3; 978-1-118-39442-7				2016							404	418																WOS:000456962700034
J	Sano, LL; Bartell, SM; Landrum, PF				Sano, LL; Bartell, SM; Landrum, PF			Decay model for biocide treatment of unballasted vessels: Application for the Laurentian Great Lakes	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A biocide decay model was developed to assess the potential efficacy and environmental impacts associated with using glutaraldehyde to treat unballasted overseas vessels trading on the Laurentian Great Lakes. The results of Monte Carlo simulations indicate that effective glutaraldehyde concentrations can be maintained for the duration of a vessel's oceanic transit (approximately 9-12 days): During this transit, glutaraldehyde concentrations were predicted to decrease by approximately 10% from initial treatment levels (e.g., 500 mg L-1). In terms of environmental impacts, mean glutaraldehyde concentrations released at Duluth-Superior Harbor, MN were predicted to be 100-fold lower than initial treatment concentrations, and ranged from 3.2 mg L-1 (2 SD: 2.74) in April to 0.7 mg L-1 (2 SD: 1.28) in August. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the reballasting dilution factor was the major variable governing final glutaraldehyde concentrations; however, lake surface temperatures became increasingly important during the warmer summer months.

Population genetic structure of the char species of the Northern Kuril Islands and the rank of the Dolly Varden Char in the system of the genus Salvelinus (Salmonidae: Teleostei)	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												Analysis of the taxonomic position of most species and forms of the char (genus Salvelinus, Salmonidae: Teleostei) was made based on RAPD-PCR. The material was represented by samples from 29 populations from the Kuril Islands, coast of the Sea of Okhotsk, Kamchatka, Chukotka, Taymyr, Transbaikalia, the Kola Peninsula, Svalbard, Finland, and North America. It was shown that the genus Salvelinus splits into three well-justified clusters: (1) all the forms assigned to the Salvelinus alpinus - S. malma complex; (2) two samples of the White-Spotted Char from the Southern Kuril Islands and from Kamchatka; (3) two North American species, S. fontinalis and S. namaycush (samples of the North American species S. confluentis were absent from the collection). Analysis of the absolute values of genetic disctances of the S. alpinus - S. malma forms relative to S. leucomaenis, S. fontinalis, and S. namaycush revealed distances approaching the species rank between the following isolates: Frolikh Char, Mountain Char, Black Lake Char, Goggle-Eyed Char, and Neyva Char. Samples of Dolly Varden currently considered as "S. malma", do not constitute a separate cluster, falling within the group of the Arctic char S. alpinus. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of the results of three series of experiments by R. Phillips on ITS l ribosome genes (Pleute et al., 1992; Phillips et al., 1995; Phillips et al., 1999). This indicates the infraspecific rank of malma within S. alpinus. Isolated populations of "Salvethymus svetovidovi" from the lake Elgygytgyn (Chukotka Peninsula) and of the char from the lake Chyomoye (Onekotan Island), recently described as S. gritzenkoi (Vasil'eva, Stygar, 2000), fell withing the S. alpinus - S. malma complex, the Onekotan char grouped together with another isolate from the same island. Comparison of genetic distances between the samples showed that the differences between the two isolated of Onekotan and migratory forms of the Kuril Islands are approximately equal, yet the homogeneity of the Chyomoye sample is higher than that of the other samples. The revealed 330-nucleotide diagnostic sequence of the Onekotan take isolate showed identity of part of the fragment with a section of expressed DNA from the library of EST clones derived from the gills of Salmo salar, this possibly indicates the adaptive character of the evolution.

J	Motyka, RJ; Truffer, M				Motyka, Roman J.; Truffer, Martin			Hubbard Glacier, Alaska: 2002 closure and outburst of Russell Fjord and postflood conditions at Gilbert Point	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Hubbard Glacier, the largest temperate tidewater glacier in the world, has been advancing since 1895 AD and has now twice dammed 60-km-long Russell Fjord, once in 1986 and more recently in 2002. This paper focuses on the 2002 event, when a strong spring advance pushed shallow submarine proglacial sediments against Gilbert Point, closing off Russell Fjord by late June. As a consequence, upstream ice flow decelerated from 5 m d(-1) to 1.5 m d(-1), with flow diverging to either side of Gilbert Point. Lake height reached 15 m asl before intense rains caused lake water to overtop the moraine dam on 14 August 2002. Three cubic kilometers of water were released within 30 hours, with peak discharge reaching 55,000 m(3) s(-1) 24 hours after the flood began. The discharge records for the 1986 and 2002 outbursts differ significantly and reflect differences in lake height (26 m versus 15 m) and dam types (ice versus moraine). The 2002 outburst proceeded in two stages: (1) relatively slow overtopping of the subaerial moraine with downward erosion rates of 1-2 m h(-1) with little lateral expansion, (2) followed by faster downward erosion of the submarine moraine (up to 7 m h(-1)) with rapid lateral expansion of the channel by ice calving (similar to 7 m h(-1)). The annual average terminus position at Gilbert Point has remained constant since 2002, although there are seasonal variations of 100-200 m. The deep channel, strong tidal currents, and seasonally warm ocean water appear to have prevented the advance of this segment of the terminus despite the glacier's continued advance elsewhere along its terminus. Sediments are slowly filling in the channel at a rate of about 4 m yr(-1), and their steady accumulation may eventually trigger the next closure.																			2169-9003	2169-9011				APR 14	2007	112	F2							F02004	10.1029/2006JF000475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JF000475													WOS:000245728900001

Phillips; Palic, Dusan			Biosecurity and Vaccines for Emerging Aquatic Animal RNA Viruses	VIRUSES-BASEL												Emerging RNA viruses pose a critical threat to aquatic animals, leading to significant ecological and economic consequences. Their high mutation rates and genetic adaptability drive rapid evolution, cross-species transmission, and expanding host ranges, complicating disease management. In aquaculture, RNA viruses are responsible for major outbreaks in fish, while DNA viruses predominate in crustaceans. Marine mammals are increasingly affected by morbilliviruses and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, which has caused widespread mortality events in pinniped and cetacean populations, raising concerns about zoonotic spillover. The absence of effective antiviral treatments and the complexity of vaccine development highlight the urgent need for enhanced biosecurity measures. Furthermore, novel vaccine approaches, such as self-assembling protein nanocage platforms, offer promising solutions for RNA virus mitigation. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the emergence and significance of RNA viruses in aquatic animals over the last two decades, with a particular focus on biosecurity and vaccine development.																				1999-4915				MAY 28	2025	17	6							768	10.3390/v17060768	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v17060768								40573359					WOS:001516058600001

Cattle deaths were recorded in connection with a high biomass of blue-green algae as early as 1968. A mouse bioassay in the 1980s confirmed the occurrence of hepatotoxic algae. In 1995, phytoplankton biomass and microcystin concentrations were measured. A mouse bioassay was carried out simultaneously showing that from the end of June, when the blue-green algae appeared, and until their disappearance at the end of October, the blooms were hepatotoxic. The blue-green alga Microcystis wesenbergii dominated over most of this period, although, Microcystis botrys, M. flos-aquae, M. viridis, Aphanizomenon klebahnii and Woronichinia naegeliana also occurred frequently. However, the algal toxicity was not related with any specific alga or with any of the measured parameters. The highest toxin production was measured in July, although the blue-green algal biomass was low at that time.					; Lawton, Linda/AAP-9617-2021	Lawton, Linda/0000-0002-7840-5310; 													0018-8158					JUN	1999	404						123	129		10.1023/A:1003780731471	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003780731471													WOS:000083700800015

We collected 2427 individual fishes in 70 species. Mean abundance of individuals at sites was 66, and mean species richness per site was 8.1. We used two multivariate procedures to predict fish-assemblage variation from habitat and environmental variables: an indirect gradient approach (reciprocal averaging [RA]) and a direct gradient approach (canonical correspondence analysis [CCA]). When we applied a forward selection process in the CCA, the habitat and environmental variables that contributed significantly to explaining variation in fishes were mean elevation, latitude, maximum depth, conductivity, longitude, dissolved oxygen, cobble and sand substrates, and lake-surface area. RA provided different results that suggested the presence of additional environmental gradients we did not quantify. Our results show that floodplain lakes in the Ohio River basin contain high species richness and are important habitats to conserve because they have the potential to act as source pools for river fish populations.

J	SIMENGANDO, T; HARTMANN, HJ				SIMENGANDO, T; HARTMANN, HJ			SHORT-TERM VARIATIONS OF THE ABUNDANCE AND BIOMASS OF PLANKTONIC CILIATES IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY												Short-time spatio-temporal variations of planktonic ciliates in a eutrophic lake were examined for evidence of diel vertical migration in relation to food supply (bacteria, nanoplankton, and detritus) and physico-chemical parameters. Two campaigns were conducted during successive summers in Lake Aydat, France. Ciliates were less abundant during the first campaign (July 1988; global means 1500 cells/l and 61.0-mu-gC/l) than during the second (July 1989; 5000 cells/l; 110.8-mu-gC/l). On both dates, ciliate abundance decreased from surface to depth, while biomass increased. Each layer (epilimnion, metalimnion, hypolimnion) was inhabited by a separate ciliate community, generally dominated by bacterivores/detritivores. There was no clear evidence of vertical migrations across major physical-chemical boundaries. Circadian variations in each layer occurred independently of light-dark rhythms, partly due to micropatchiness. Temporal variability increased from the vertically mixed epilimnion (C.V. = 32%-41%) to the well stratified deeper zones (C.V. = 41%-100%). Ciliate biomass was negatively and significantly correlated to temperature and dissolved oxygen, and to most principal food parameters. The vertical differences in ciliate biomass were linked to the long-term (seasonal) evolution of the lake system (correlations with temperature, oxygen) and its larger-sized food resources (correlations with chlorophyll, nanoplankton, detritus). By contrast, circadian variations of ciliates were linked to availability of bacteria, an important food resource for many ciliate species of this study.

J	Nazeer, M; Wong, MS; Nichol, JE				Nazeer, Majid; Wong, Man Sing; Nichol, Janet Elizabeth			A new approach for the estimation of phytoplankton cell counts associated with algal blooms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study proposes a method for estimating phytoplankton cell counts associated with an algal bloom, using satellite images coincident with in situ and meteorological parameters. Satellite images from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Operational Land Imager (OLD and Hj-1 A/B Charge Couple Device (CCD) sensors were integrated with the meteorological observations to provide an estimate of phytoplankton cell counts. All images were atmospherically corrected using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) atmospheric correction method with a possible error of 1.2%, 2.6%, 1.4% and 23% for blue (450-520 nm), green (520-600 nm), red (630-690 nm) and near infrared (NIR 760-900 nm) wavelengths, respectively. Results showed that the developed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model yields a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 with the in situ validation data with Sum of Squared Error (SSE) of 034 cell/ml, Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 0.154 cells/ml and a bias of -504.87. The integration of the meteorological parameters with remote sensing observations provided a promising estimation of the algal scum as compared to previous studies. The applicability of the ANN model was tested over Hong Kong as well as over Lake Kasumigaura, Japan and Lake Okeechobee, Florida USA, where algal blooms were also reported. Further, a 40-year (1975-2014) red tide occurrence map was developed and revealed that the eastern and southern waters of Hong Kong are more vulnerable to red tides. Over the 40 years, 66% of red tide incidents were associated with the Dinoflagellates group, while the remainder were associated with the Diatom group (14%) and several other minor groups (20%). The developed technology can be applied to other similar environments in an efficient and cost saving manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nag, D; Phartiyal, B				Nag, Debarati; Phartiyal, Binita			Climatic variations and geomorphology of the Indus River valley, between Nimo and Batalik, Ladakh (NW Trans Himalayas) during Late Quaternary	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Indus River valley is tectonically unstable, exhibiting complex topography, landscape relief, and varied sedimentation. The major geomorphic landforms are alluvial fans, debris cones, fluvio-lacustrine deposits, scree, and talus cones. In the present work, a transect between Nimo and Batalik along the river was studied to consider the geomorphological landform evolution during the Quaternary based on the distribution of the sediments along the valley. Mass movements, catastrophic land sliding and tectonic activity transported material from steep slopes to valley bottoms which were responsible for forming lakes (preserved as thick piles of fine sediment), while the outburst floods redistributed sediment down valley. Three phases of lake formation are recorded in the 136 km stretch - similar to 35,000-26,000 BP (Lamayuru palaeolake); 17,000-13,000 BP (Rizong palaeolake) occupying 35 km of the valley length, and 14,000-5000 BP (Khalsi-Saspol palaeolake) 55 km in length and having the highest lake levels. The lake formation is attributed to deglaciation after the Last Glacial maximum (LGM) and Holocene warming. Tectonic activity (seismites) are concentrated only at 10 and 6 ka.

J	Twining, BS; Mylon, SE; Benoit, G				Twining, Benjamin S.; Mylon, Steven E.; Benoit, Gaboury			Potential role of copper availability in nitrous oxide accumulation in a temperate lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Denitrifying bacteria require copper for the synthesis of nitrous oxide reductase. In the absence of sufficient bioavailable Cu, nitrous oxide (N2O) may accumulate in natural waters during denitrification. Cultures of Paracoccus denitrificans and natural bacterial assemblages collected from a mesotrophic lake (Linsley Pond) were grown at varying Cu concentrations to determine the Cu speciation that results in elevated N2O accumulation. P. denitrificans experienced Cu limitation beginning at inorganic Cu concentrations of 0.6 fmol L-1 (-log of inorganic Cu, pCu', 5 15.2). The natural community did not show an effect until pCu' was reduced to 23.7 with 8- hydroxyquinoline, resulting in an approximate 10- fold increase in N2O concentrations during denitrification. Additions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid alone to natural communities did not affect N2O concentrations. Natural copper- binding ligands detected with competitive ligand exchange - cathodic stripping voltammetry occurred at concentrations of 6 to 25 nmol L-1 with conditional stability constants ( K (Cu2+L)) between 10(14.4) and 10(15.1). Although more than 99% of total Cu in Linsley Pond was bound to these ligands, inorganic Cu concentrations remained 10 orders of magnitude above those found to increase N2O accumulation during denitrification incubations. Measurements of nitrogen species, dissolved oxygen, and sulfide in the water column of Linsley Pond over the spring growing season revealed that N2O was produced by assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrification in addition to denitrification, with nitrification generating most of the N2O found in the surface waters of the lake. The results suggest that inorganic Cu concentrations in Linsley Pond are sufficient to support denitrification. Moreover, some denitrifying bacteria may be able to access organically bound Cu, reducing the potential for this metal to affect N2O production in other aquatic environments.

Similar to may aquatic habitats, it is exposed to intensive agricultural, domestic, and industrial pollution. The aim of this study was to determine the toxic element levels in Porsuk Stream Basin sediment and evaluate the detected data using a multi-statistical technique. For this purpose, sediment samples were collected from 18 stations selected on the basin (three of them located on Porsuk Dam Lake) in summer 2015, and zinc, copper, lead, cadmium, nickel, and chromium accumulations in sediment samples were determined. All the detected data were compared with the consensus-based threshold effect concentrations (TEC), and factor analysis (FA) also was applied to detected data in order to evaluate the contamination grades in the basin. According to detected data, although Cu, Pb, and Cd concentrations were detected below the limit values, Zn, Cr, and Ni concentrations exceeded the limit values in general. According to results of FA, 3 factors - industrial, agricultural, and lead - explained 81.56% of the total variance.

The atmosphere contributed 43% of the N and 10% of the P that was added during the year. The 1975-1976 atmospheric loading rate of total N to this area (11 kg/ha per yr) was one of the highest found to date in the [USA]. N was conserved more efficiently than P in the tributary drainage basins. Of the N and P that fell annually on the watersheds under study, 2-37% of the N and 31-84% of the P was carried with runoff to the lake. From a basin where ditching and clear-cutting occurrred, water, P, SiO2, N and Na were lost at higher rates than from 5 other basins. Most of the N in bulk atmospheric samples (23%) and tributary waters (56%) was dissolved organic N, a form of N not often measured.																			0380-1330						1983	9	3					403	420		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71912-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71912-X													WOS:A1983RE99400009

Lake Titicaca was a deep, fresh, and continuously overflowing Lake during the Last glacial stage, from before 25,000 to 15,000 calibrated years before the present (cal yr B.P.), signifying that during the Last glacial maximum (LGM), the Altiplano of Bolivia and Peru and much of the Amazon basin were wetter than today. The LGM in this part of the Andes is dated at 21,000 cal yr B.P., approximately coincident with the global LGM. Maximum aridity and Lowest Lake Level occurred in the early and middle Holocene (8000 to 5500 cat yr B.P.) during a time of Low summer insolation. Today, rising Levels of Lake Titicaca and wet conditions in Amazonia are correlated with anomalously cold sea-surface temperatures in the northern equatorial Atlantic. Likewise, during the deglacial and Holocene periods, there were several millennial-scale wet phases on the Altiplano and in Amazonia that coincided with anomalously cold periods in the equatorial and high-latitude North Atlantic, such as the Younger Dryas.					; Tapia, Pedro/GYR-1147-2022; Tapia, Pedro M/GYR-1147-2022; Grove, Martin/KYQ-2117-2024	Dunbar, Robert/0000-0002-9728-5609; Rowe, Harry/0000-0002-1665-6261; Tapia, Pedro M/0000-0002-0708-4468; 													0036-8075					JAN 26	2001	291	5504					640	643		10.1126/science.291.5504.640	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.291.5504.640								11158674					WOS:000166616000040

Ultraviolet radiation and bio-optics in Crater Lake, Oregon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Crater Lake, Oregon, is a mid-latitude caldera lake famous for its depth (594 m) and blue color. Recent underwater spectral measurements of solar radiation (300-800 nm) support earlier observations of unusual transparency and extend these to UV-B wavelengths. New data suggest that penetration of solar UVR into Crater Lake has a significant ecological impact. Evidence includes a correlation between water column chlorophyll-a and stratospheric ozone since 1984, the scarcity of organisms in the upper water column, and apparent UV screening pigments in phytoplankton that vary with depth. The lowest UV-B diffuse attenuation coefficients (K (d,320)) were similar to those reported for the clearest natural waters elsewhere, and were lower than estimates for pure water published in 1981. Optical proxies for UVR attenuation were correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration (0-30 m) during typical dry summer months from 1984 to 2002. Using all proxies and measurements of UV transparency, decadal and longer cycles were apparent but no long-term trend since the first optical measurement in 1896.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2007	574						107	140		10.1007/s10750-006-0348-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0348-0													WOS:000242361600007

Annual surveys over a 12-year period (2000-2011) were used to investigate the spatial distribution of adfluvial Bull Trout redds in river systems of CML relative to reservoir elevation. Because reservoir elevations were lower in the spawning season than during the incubation period, some redds placed in river reaches near the reservoir were vulnerable to cumulative effects from impending inundation as reservoir levels increased and as fine sediments settled across gravel substrates. Higher average elevation of CML during the peak period of spawning caused significantly lower percentages of Bull Trout redds in lowermost river reaches, where fluctuating water levels could adversely affect incubating eggs (R-2 = 0.73). Annually, the proportion of redds distributed within habitat reaches where inundation, as indicated by mean CML elevation during the incubation period, could affect them, varied from 1% to 18%. However, a greater proportion of annual Bull Trout redds (10-68%) fell within the maximum reservoir elevation during the incubation period. These results suggest that maintaining moderate reservoir elevations during the spawning season and holding the reservoir near this elevation through the incubation period can lower the effect on incubating Bull Trout redds. The implications for water level management to benefit adfluvial Bull Trout derived from this data set could also be applicable in similar systems, especially where knowledge of temporal and spatial distribution of salmonid spawning is available.

Comparative studies from a large number of populations under varying sets of ecological drivers could contribute to a better understanding of this relationship. We used data on morphology of arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and ecological factors from 35 Icelandic lakes to test the hypothesis that morphological patterns among monomorphic charr populations from different lakes are related to interlake variation in ecological characteristics. There is extensive phenotypic diversity among populations of Icelandic charr, and populations are easily distinguished based on overall body morphology. The results obtained in the present study showed that the morphological diversity of charr was related to large-scale diversity in lake ecology. Variation in charr morphology was related to water origin (e. g. spring fed versus run-off), bedrock age, and fish community structure. The present study shows how various ecological factors can shape the biological diversity that we observe.

Our results showed that when filter-feeding planktivorous fishes were in high yield, Rotifera and medium cladocera accounted for a large proportion of the community; when they were in low yield, small cladocera increased with the increased nutrient level. The detrended correspondence analysis demonstrated that planktivorous fish and cyanobacteria were important factors influencing the zooplankton community. The linear regression analysis showed that the fraction of Rotifera increased and Calanoida decreased with the increasing fish yield; the fraction of small cladocera increased with the increasing cyanobacteria. The results implied that zooplankton community succession was strengthened by the combined effects of planktivorous fish and cyanobacteria. The effects of filter-feeding planktivorous fish on zooplankton depend on the survival ability of different zooplankton species as well as the size. With the combined effects of planktivorous fish culture and eutrophication, the zooplankton community tend to be dominated by r-strategy species and good escape ability species.

Relationships between the abundance and diversity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and physicochemical parameters were also explored. The AOA abundance decreased sharply from west to east; however, the AOB abundance changed slightly with AOB outnumbering AOA in two of the four sediment samples (JS), JS3 and JS4. The AOA abundance was significantly correlated with the NH4-N, NO3-N, and TP. No significant correlations were observed between the AOB abundance and environmental variables. AOB had a higher diversity and richness of amoA genes than AOA. Among the 76 archaeal amoA sequences retrieved, 57.89, 38.16, and 3.95 % fell within the Nitrosopumilus, Nitrososphaera, and Nitrososphaera sister clusters, respectively. The 130 bacterial amoA gene sequences obtained in this study were grouped with known AOB sequences in the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira genera, which occupied 72.31 % and 27.69 % of the AOB group, respectively. Compared to the other three sample sites, the AOA and AOB community compositions at JS4 showed a large difference. This work could enhance our understanding of the roles of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in freshwater lake environment.																			0343-8651	1432-0991				NOV	2014	69	5					751	757		10.1007/s00284-014-0646-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-014-0646-0								25008777					WOS:000343913500023

Data from nearshore cores show that the uppermost strong reflector represents a stiff silt unit, interpreted as a desiccation surface. Channel cuts in this surface, bordered by levee-like structures, are apparent in the seismic data from near the lake margin, suggesting fluvial downcutting and over-bank deposition during seasonal flood events. Periphytic diatoms and peat at the base of a core from the deepest part of the lake overlie compacted sediments, indicating that desiccation was followed by development of shallow-water environments and papyrus swamp in the central basin between 16,700 and 15, 100 cat BP. As the lake level rose, open-water evaporation from the closed lake caused it to become slightly saline, as indicated by halophytic diatoms. An abrupt return to freshwater conditions occurred at 14,750 cat BP, when the lake overflowed into the Blue Nile. Further reflection surfaces with downcut structures are identifiable in seismic images of the overlying sediments, suggesting at least two lesser lake-level falls, tentatively dated to about 12,000 and 8000 cat BP. Since Lake Victoria, the source of the White Nile, was also dry until 15,000 cat BP, and did not reach overflow until 14,500 cat BP, the entire Nile system must have been reduced to intermittent seasonal flow until about 14,500 cat BP, when baseflow was re-established with almost simultaneous overflow of the headwater lakes of both the White and Blue Nile rivers. Desiccation of the Nile sources coincides with Heinrich event 1, when cessation of northward heat transport from the tropical Atlantic disrupted the Atlantic monsoon, causing drought in north tropical Africa. The strong reflectors at deeper levels in the seismic sequence of Lake Tana may represent earlier desiccation events, possibly contemporaneous with previous Late Pleistocene Heinrich events.

J	Magill, N; Sansalone, J				Magill, Natalie; Sansalone, John			Distribution of Particulate-Bound Metals for Source Area Snow in the Lake Tahoe Watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The porous matrix and long residence time of snow in traffic corridors can result in the accretion of particulate matter (PM) and metals. This temporary repository contributes PM-based and dissolved metals to surrounding environs during snowmelt. This study focused on distribution and settling of PM-based metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn) in snow. Snow was sampled from six sites during four winter seasons. PM-based metals are examined herein as a function of PM granulometry, specifically particle-size distributions (PSDs) and PM surface area. Cumulative metal mass distributions across each PSD are modeled as gamma functions. Results indicate Al (15 g/kg) and Fe (4.2 g/kg) are the highest PM-based concentrations; Cd (0.18 mg/kg) and As (4.9 mg/kg) are the lowest. The PM size (d(50 m)) associated with the median metal mass ranges from 179 to 542 mu m. The constitutive gamma results are integrated with Hazen's settling algorithm to model PM-bound metal separation for a sedimentation basin at a local snow storage site. Flows are modeled in the storm water management model (SWMM) from snowmelt and historical rainfall time series. Results indicate that Type I sedimentation is capable of separating the sediment fraction (>75 mu m) and majority of metal mass. While the basin is effective at separation of coarser PM-based metals, additional practices such as pavement and drainage appurtenance cleaning, as well as adsorptive-filtration can further manage suspended PM and metals, as well as dissolved metals.																			0733-9372	1943-7870				FEB	2010	136	2					185	193		10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000146													WOS:000273673800003

Methods for estimating detection efficiency and tracking acoustic tags with mobile transect surveys	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Mobile transect surveys were conducted for 5 years in a deep fjord looking for weak acoustic tags, most of which were in dead fishes lying on the seabed. Detection efficiencies were quantified because inferences about fish presence were made from tag detection data but a considerable proportion of tags were not detected. Methods for assessing transect widths using cumulative probabilities of measured perpendicular distances from blind transect lines to triangulated tag locations are described. Three methods for estimating detection efficiencies are presented: fitting attenuation functions to perpendicular distance data, simultaneous use of two receiver systems and test tag surveys. Several factors that influenced these detection efficiencies and ranges are shown, including boat speed, depth of tag, tag type, different hydrophone-receiver systems and variation among individual hydrophones and receivers of the same model. The trade-off between detection efficiency per unit area and area swept is discussed, which is largely based on boat speed during transects. Finally, several methods are suggested for increasing decoding efficiencies in mobile tracking studies when tags are heard but are difficult to decode.

Improving flood hazard datasets using a low-complexity, probabilistic floodplain mapping approach	PLOS ONE												As runoff patterns shift with a changing climate, it is critical to effectively communicate current and future flood risks, yet existing flood hazard maps are insufficient. Modifying, extending, or updating flood inundation extents is difficult, especially over large scales, because traditional floodplain mapping approaches are data and resource intensive. Low-complexity floodplain mapping techniques are promising alternatives, but their simplistic representation of process falls short of capturing inundation patterns in all situations or settings. To address these needs and deficiencies, we formalize and extend the functionality of the Height Above Nearest Drainage (i.e., HAND) floodplain mapping approach into the probHAND model by incorporating an uncertainty analysis. With publicly available datasets, the probHAND model can produce probabilistic floodplain maps for large areas relatively rapidly. We describe the modeling approach and then provide an example application in the Lake Champlain Basin, Vermont, USA. Uncertainties translate to on-the-ground changes to inundated areas, or floodplain widths, in the study area by an average of 40%. We found that the spatial extent of probable inundation captured the distribution of observed and modeled flood extents well, suggesting that low-complexity models may be sufficient for representing inundation extents in support of flood risk and conservation mapping applications, especially when uncertainties in parameter inputs and process simplifications are accounted for. To improve the accuracy of flood hazard datasets, we recommend investing limited resources in accurate topographic datasets and improved flood frequency analyses. Such investments will have the greatest impact on decreasing model output variability, therefore increasing the certainty of flood inundation extents.

J	Nicolaus, B; Kambourova, M; Oner, ET				Nicolaus, Barbara; Kambourova, Margarita; Oner, Ebru Toksoy			Exopolysaccharides from extremophiles: from fundamentals to biotechnology	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) make up a substantial component of the extracellular polymers surrounding most microbial cells in extreme environments like Antarctic ecosystems, saline lakes, geothermal springs or deep sea hydrothermal vents. The extremophiles have developed various adaptations, enabling them to compensate for the deleterious effects of extreme conditions, e.g. high temperatures, salt, low pH or temperature, high radiation. Among these adaptation strategies, EPS biosynthesis is one of the most common protective mechanisms. The unusual metabolic pathways revealed in some extremophiles raised interest in extremophilic microorganisms as potential producers of EPSs with novel and unusual characteristics and functional activities under extreme conditions. Even though the accumulated knowledge on the structural and rheological properties of EPSs from extremophiles is still very limited, it reveals a variety in properties, which may not be found in more traditional polymers. Both extremophilic microorganisms and their EPSs suggest several biotechnological advantages, like short fermentation processes for thermophiles and easily formed and stable emulsions of EPSs from psychrophiles. Unlike mesophilic producers of EPSs, many of them being pathogenic, extremophilic microorganisms provide non-pathogenic products, appropriate for applications in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries as emulsifiers, stabilizers, gel agents, coagulants, thickeners and suspending agents. The commercial value of EPSs synthesized by microorganisms from extreme habitats has been established recently.

Sutlej River exhibits a rich array of cyanobacterial diversity, comprising 28 species across 15 genera, distributed among 11 families and spanning 5 orders within the class Cyanophyceae. In terms of relative abundance, Microcystis aeruginosa (17.47%) was documented as the most abundant taxa followed by Microcystis robusta (16.55%), Merismopedia punctata (11.03%), Arthrospira fusiformis (6.67%) and Pseudanabaena galeata (3.68%). Significant variations were observed among sampling sites in most of the physico-chemical parameters. Principal Component Analysis delineated sampling sites into two discernible groups according to variations in water chemistry. River Pollution Index (RPI) showed that river water is under the unpolluted (RPI 1.5) to negligibly polluted category in the upstream sites, while moderately polluted (RPI 5.5) in the downstream sites. Heavy metal Pollution Index (HPI) revealed consistent heavy metal contamination at sites RWS7 and RWS8 across all seasons. Conversely, site RWS1 consistently exhibited lower HPI values throughout the three studied seasons. Further, Canonical Correspondence Analysis identified that pH, TDS, TA, NO3, Na, and NH4 are the key physicochemical parameters which affect the spatiotemporal distribution of cyanobacteria in the studied river system. Overall, this study will offer significant information for hydrologists, ecologists, and taxonomists to develop future holistic strategies for further monitoring of the Sutlej River and other similar habitats.					; Thapa, Komal/AAU-8560-2021; Singh, Yadvinder/AAM-7656-2021; Rangra, Gurdarshan/JOK-1654-2023	Singh, Gurdarshan/0000-0001-6103-5619; Singh, Yadvinder/0000-0002-5835-718X; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2024	196	10							937	10.1007/s10661-024-13011-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-13011-4								39285104					WOS:001314719800001

As a result of tectonic activity, the outlet of Baikal through the paleo-Manzurka valley to the Lena River was barred 2.0-0.5 Ma ago, and a new outlet appeared through the Il'cha-Irkut valley to the Yenisei system (0.5-0.06 Ma ago). This outflow was substituted by the present Angara outlet that was opened due to collapse of the Listvyanka block about 60 ka ago. Calculations show that a geologically long lake level fall in the past is unlikely, but short low-stand episodes appear probable. The terraces surrounding the lake were produced by the joint effect of hydrology and tectonism. Analysis of the past evolution of the drainage network in the Western Baikal region allowed prediction of its possible future changes.

Microcrustaceans and predators: diel migration in a tropical lake and comparison with shallow warm lakes	LIMNETICA												Diel horizontal migration (DHM) and diel vertical migration (DVM) of planktonic microcrustaceans and invertebrate predators were studied simultaneously in a tropical shallow lake. DIM was not performed, and DVM was irregularly performed by the species. DHM of microcrustaceans does not seem to replace DVM as a strategy for decreasing predation risk in this shallow lake. The invertebrate predators, the IV instar of Chaoborus brasiliensis and the water mite Krendowskia sp., were mostly limnetic, the latter undergoing a nocturnal DVM that was not evident for the chaoborid larvae because a portion of the individuals remained in the water column in the daytime. DVM of some microcrustaceans, such as Ceriodaphnia richardi, Daphnia ambigua, Daphnia gessneri, and Thermocyclops decipiens, decreased the overlap with predators. Other behaviours, such as onshore location and occupation of the uppermost layers, seem to be more effective for coping with predation by limnetic invertebrate predators. Dissolved oxygen is a counteracting factor for only the vertical distribution because its concentration is low near the bottom in summer but not in the littoral zone. The lack of DHM in this study agrees with the results of most warm shallow lakes.

Phytoplankton biomass was uniform from the surface to the maximum depth while the lake mixed completely in March, but was lower in aphotic waters during thermal stratification. Aphotic chlorophyll a concentrations decreased progressively in fall and reached a minimum of 17% of mean euphotic concentrations in Jan., before the mixing depth exceeded the euphotic depth. Photosynthetic rates measured in an incubator under constant light conditions were significantly correlated with pigment concentrations in euphotic and aphotic phytoplankton and demonstrated viability of the aphotic phytoplankton throughout the year. High surface: volume ratios of the small species dominating the phytoplankton assemblage suggest low sinking velocities. Extremely slow decomposition is postulated to explain the vertical pigment concentration gradients in the aphotic zone. Re-entry of viable aphotic phytoplankton into the euphotic zone during deep mixing of the lake can diminish the dilution of euphotic phytoplankton, thereby increasing the magnitude of the subsequent vernal bloom.

The aim of this study was to identify the autotrophic periphytic components (APC) in some Iranian aquatic ecosystems and investigate the possibility of its re-culture under in-vitro condition. Limnological (chemical and biological) properties of bed sediments, periphytic biofilms, and water of lakes, such as biological and chemical oxygen demand (BOD and COD), pH, EC, temperature, nitrogen, total and available phosphorous were measured. Then APC of Epixylon and lakes water samples were isolated and purified in their specific culture medium. Based on results, identified genera included a variety of filamentous and single-celled algae, cyanobacteria, and diatoms. In Fashtam Lake, Chlorophyceae, Charophyceae, Euglenozoa, Ochrophyta, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanobacteria constituted about 38.48%, 20.58%, 1.72%, 1.74%, 19.68%, and 19.52% of the APC, respectively. In Tazesel Lake, Chlorophyceae, Euglenozoa, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanobacteria constituted about 13.93%, 0.56%, 51.9%, and 33.6%, and in Qalewersel Lake, Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanobacteria constituted 26.24%, 56.06% and, 17.69%, respectively. To in-vitro re-culture of periphyton, all purified genera from each lake were mixed and introduced to medium, in the presence and absence of substrate and maintained in growth chamber (appropriate conditions) for 30 days. After incubation period, different genera of Chlorophyceae, Cyanobacteria and Bacillariophyceae were accounted for 70%, 20%, and 10% of the re-cultured APC in Fashtam Lake, 51.6%, 33.3%, and 15%, in Tazesel Lake, and 59.33%, 28.33%, and 12.33% in Qalewersel Lake, respectively. As a general result, it can be stated that the frequency of filamentous species of APC re-cultured on the carrier is higher than that of single-celled species of APC in greenhouse condition. Also, in this research, a great similarity was observed between the APC isolated from periphyton in the autumn season with the APC isolated and identified from re-cultured periphyton in the greenhouse; so that the predominant APC was related to the cyanobacteria, chlorophyta and bacillariophyta.

Non-climatic growth of the saline Lake Beseka, Main Ethiopian Rift	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												When using rift lakes as proxies for palaeoclimate it is essential to know if water level changes are of geological or climatic origin, and whether a reinterpretation of palaeo-lake levels derived from lithostratigraphic sequences is required. The saline, endorheic Lake Beseka is located in the tectonically active Main Ethiopian Rift. Despite the aridity of the rift valley the lake's surface area quadrupled from 11.1 km(2) in 1973 to 39.5 km(2) in 2002. We quantify the lake growth by means of a detailed bathymetric model and high-resolution satellite time series. We analyse the potential climatic, anthropogenic, and tectonic agents of Lake Beseka's growth. Multitemporal remote sensing data and meteorological records were compared with in-situ measurements of hydrochemical parameters and water depth to address the reason for the lake level rise. Our results suggest that Lake Beseka's expansion originates from ail increased discharge of the hot springs. The combined analysis of satellite data and in-situ measurements proved to be a valid tool for the quantification of lake level changes and can help to detect the causes of these variations.

J	Kennedy, CR				Kennedy, CR			Long-term and seasonal changes in composition and richness of intestinal helminth communities in eels Anguilla anguilla of an isolated English river	FOLIA PARASITOLOGICA												The need for more long-term studies on helminth communities was addressed by examining changes in composition and diversity of the intestinal helminth component and infracommunities in eels of a small isolated river over 12 years. Examination of samples over one summer season indicated that single samples were representative of community richness in that year. In 1985 the community was species poor(1 species only) and with zero diversity, but by 1996 it comprised six species and all parameters at both levels indicated that it was the richest community yet reported from eels. This overall increase in diversity was not regular or uniform from year to year: rather, the general trend could be reversed in any year(s) and variation between years was considerable. The occurrence of many species was erratic and the identity of the dominant species varied between years. The helminth species that colonised the river contributed to helminth species richness and had an impact on community diversity. It is believed that the overall increase in diversity reflects the changing conditions in the habitat and catchment, but the erratic fluctuations in parameters may reflect the size of the river and the absence of any rescue effects. The findings are compared with the few other long-term studies and it is suggested that the extent of the variation over long periods makes it very difficult to use helminths as indicators of other than general environmental changes or to detect short-term changes due to such specific sources as pollution.																			0015-5683	1803-6465					1997	44	4					267	273											9437839					WOS:A1997YJ99000004
J	MUIRWOOD, R; KING, GCP				MUIRWOOD, R; KING, GCP			HYDROLOGICAL SIGNATURES OF EARTHQUAKE STRAIN	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												The character of the hydrological changes that follow major earthquakes has been investigated and found to be dependent on the style of faulting. The most significant response is found to accompany major normal fault earthquakes. Increases in spring and river discharges peak a few days after the earthquake, and typically, excess flow is sustained for a period of 6-12 months. In contrast, hydrological changes accompanying pure reverse fault earthquakes are either undetected or indicate lowering of well levels and spring flows. Strike-slip and oblique-slip fault movements are associated with a mixture of responses but appear to release no more than 10% of the water volume of the same sized normal fault event. For two major normal fault earthquakes in the western United States (those of Hebgen Lake on August 17, 1959, and Borah Peak on October 28, 1983), there is sufficient river flow information to allow the magnitude and extent of the postseismic discharge to be quantified. The discharge has been converted to a rainfall equivalent, which is found to exceed 100 mm close to the fault and to remain above 10 mm at distances greater than 50 km. The total volume of water released in these earthquakes was around 0.3 km3 (Borah Peak) and 0.5 km3 (Hebgen Lake). Qualitative information on other major normal fault earthquakes, in both the western United States and Italy, indicates that the size, duration, and range of their hydrological signatures have been similar. The magnitude and distribution of the water discharge for these events are compared with deformation models calibrated using seismic and geodetic information. The quantity of water released over a time period of 6-12 months suggests that crustal volume strain to a depth of at least 5 km is involved. The rise and decay times of the discharge are shown to be critically dependent on crack widths, and it is concluded that the dominant cracks have a high aspect ratio and cannot be much wider than 0.03 mm. Using the estimated depth to which water is mobilized, the modeled crack size, and the measured volumes of water expelled, it is concluded that even at distances of 50 km from the earthquake epicenters, cracks must be separated by no more than 10 or 20 m. In regions of highest discharge nearer the earthquake epicenters, separations of 1 or 2 m are required. These results suggest that water-filled cracks are ubiquitous throughout the brittle continental crust and that these cracks open and close throughout the earthquake cycle. The existence of tectonically induced fluid flows on the scale that we demonstrate has major implications for our understanding of the mechanical and chemical behavior of crustal rocks.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				DEC 10	1993	98	B12					22035	22068		10.1029/93JB02219	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JB02219													WOS:A1993ML69300025

This method appears to be a promising approach, instead of conventional analytical techniques, in the screening procedure of organic pollutants because it is simple, rapid, and specific, and it does not require sample preconcentration or cleanup. Lanthanide chelate used as label allows to achieve sensitivity even 10 times higher than most of the other techniques. It has been applied to monitoring diuron contamination in specimens collected along a year in an agricultural area. The water specimens were collected monthly from lake, well, and irrigation ditch in the agricultural area south of Milan. Assay was performed using diuron-specific polyclonal antibody raised in sheep; as fluorescent marker, we used rabbit antisheep IgG conjugated with a chelating molecule complexed with Eu3+. The compound 4-(3-(3,4-dichloro-phenyl)-1-methyl-ureido)-butyric acid (CPD) was synthesized and conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to prepare a solid phase. Sensitivity achieved was 20 ng L-1 below the European Community limits. Paraquat (PQ) and carbofuran (CF) presence in the same samples has been also evaluated in a similar way, using immunoassays with time-resolved revelation systems. Diuron concentration shows a peak coinciding with a peak of carbofuran during summer periods. The peak of diuron was 65 pg/mL in June and 180 pg/mL in September in ditch and lake water samples, respectively; carbofuran concentration was higher than diuron in all samples: a carbofuran peak was revealed in September and October resulting in 87 ng/mL. Herbicide paraquat was not detectable in any assayed sample.																			0021-8561	1520-5118				MAY 16	2007	55	10					3823	3828		10.1021/jf063442o	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf063442o								17429981					WOS:000246313200012
J	Power, P				Power, P			Effects of current velocity and substrate composition on growth of Texas wildrice (Zizania texana)	AQUATIC BOTANY												Zizania texana Hitchc., an endangered macrophyte has declined in number during the past 50 years. To determine the effects of substrate composition and current velocity on plant growth, plants were grown in pots containing either fine or coarse sediment at three sites in Spring Lake, Hays Co., TX. Each site was similar in depth but differed in current velocity. Plants were allowed to grow for 6 weeks and then harvested. Growth was greater on fine sediments. There was significant interaction between flow and sediment with respect to aboveground biomass and stem density and, there was significant flow effect on leaf length and stem density. Stem density was greater in fast flowing water (0.40-0.49 m s(-1)) than either moderate (0.12-0.24 m s(-1)) or slow flowing (0.05-0.12 m s(-1))water. The decline in Zizania texana population can be attributed, in part, to physical changes to Zizania texana habitat.																			0304-3770					NOV	1996	55	3					199	204		10.1016/S0304-3770(96)01073-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3770(96)01073-X													WOS:A1996WA20900005

Measurements of AHOD were positively correlated with the measured total P concentration and with annual 14C pelagic primary production and inversely correlated with mean summer Secchi depth. Because each of the correlations between AHOD and trophic status explained < 45% of the observed variation in AHOD values, other factors must also influence the AHOD of a lake. Significant amounts of the residual variation were explained by including the mean depth of the lake and mean hypolimnetic temperature as additional independent variables in a multiple regression analysis. A lake with a thicker or warmer hypolimnion had a higher AHOD than a lake with a shallow or colder hypolimnion. The AHOD model was developed to eliminate the influence of lake morphometry on interlake comparisons of hypolimnetic O2 depletion, but it does not do this. A new model must be developed.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1980	25	4					672	679		10.4319/lo.1980.25.4.0672	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1980.25.4.0672													WOS:A1980KD68300009

Spatial segregation of cisco (Coregonus artedi) and lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis) larvae in Chaumont Bay, Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Two of the remaining coregonine species in Lake Ontario, cisco (Coregonus artedi) and lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis), spawn in Chaumont Bay, New York. Larvae co-occur in the spring but are difficult to distinguish morphologically. We applied genetic species identification using microsatellite DNA loci of 268 larvae from known locations in nearshore and offshore habitats in Chaumont Bay to determine the extent of mixing of these species in each habitat. Cisco dominated the larvae (95%) in offshore habitats and lake whitefish dominated (84%) in nearshore habitats, where seven of eight putative hybrids occurred. Habitat segregation between these two species at the larval stage has implications for productivity estimates, as changing environmental conditions may differentially affect shallow and deep waters, larval survival, and possibly subsequent recruitment. Discrimination between cisco and lake whitefish larvae will help to characterize habitat and basic life history needs and to focus research collections. Genetic species identification should be applied to larger samples of larvae to evaluate changes in larval distributions and associations with environmental conditions.

An exhaustive survey of the ichthyofauna of this lake in 2001 and 2002 indicated that three of the 17 small-bodied species of the lake have probably disappeared: the Pearl Dace (Margariscus margarita), the Fivespine Stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and a special form of the Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). It is predicted that several other species may be extirpated in the next few years. Northern Pike growth in the lake is comparable to other values obtained for other southern Quebec lakes.

Three major climate stages, 8.6-7.1, 7.1-2.0 and from 2.0 cal ka BP to the present, were divided by grain size and the authigenic carbonate stable isotope of the lake sediment. Climatic drought during the period 7.1-4.5 cal ka BP, deduced from Lake Barkol, prevailed in the mid-Holocene climate in northern Xinjiang and northwest Mongolia. In contrast, it was wet in central Xinjiang, northwest India and the Middle East during the same period.

Rain and snow in this region of northern California were derived primarily from winter cyclonic storms which moved easterly from the Pacific Ocean over Davis and then Lake Tahoe. Precipitation at both sites was more acid than water in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Acidity at Lake Tahoe apparently increased over the 5 yr period of the study. Sulfate was the dominant acid anion in 1972-1973 (not measured in 1977-1978). A major source of sulfate in precipitation was probably industry in the San Francisco Bay area [USA], upwind of the study sites. Automobile exhaust emissions throughout the region, which contained 3 major interstate highways and several large urban centers, contributed sulfate and nitrate precursors to the atmosphere. As in eastern USA, these strong acid anions influenced precipitation chemistry in northern California, including the Sierra Nevada mountains.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1981	15	2					153	167		10.1007/BF00161249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00161249													WOS:A1981LG68000002

The purpose of these simulations is to isolate the phenomenon of lateral circulation driven by horizontal variations in surface albedo (e.g., due to partial snow cover) in an idealized and simplified system. The system we consider is one with uniform solar radiation except in a small "shadowed" region at the center of the domain which has damped radiation intensity. By comparing cases with and without a shadowed region, we identify gravity currents at the surface flowing away from the shadowed region. Not only do these gravity currents represent a mechanism for lateral transport at the surface below ice cover, but they also act as a catalyst for inducing earlier vertical mixing that develops at a faster rate than the Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities which drive vertical convection away from the shadow. To the authors' knowledge, only bathymetry and wind forcing at the surface have been presented as major mechanisms for lateral circulation in ice-covered lakes, and hence these simulations may provide a hitherto unreported mechanism for inducing lateral circulation.					; Grace, Andrew/ITT-9658-2023	Stastna, Marek/0000-0003-1770-2044; Allum, Donovan/0000-0001-7864-2802; Grace, Andrew/0000-0001-9616-025X													2469-990X					OCT 3	2022	7	10							103501	10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.103501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.103501													WOS:000866506600002

Humans and climate change in the middle and lower Yellow River of China	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The relationship between climate changes and human responses has been hotly debated. This paper expands this topic by reviewing and presenting case studies in the middle and lower Yellow River, Henan and Shandong provinces. We first review the paleoenvironmental data of both regions and then use the Sanyangzhuang site, Henan, and the Chengziya and Jiaojia sites, Shandong, as examples of human activities and sedimentary histories. Comparisons between the paleoenvironmental and archaeological data reveal that the changes in human occupation at these sites did not occur synchronously with climatic and paleoenvironmental changes. On the one hand, human activities were influenced by extreme climate-related events such as floods. However, humans also show great resilience by returning to the same sites or continuing cultivation at the same sites. Changes in temperature and precipitation did not result in settlement abandonments. On the other hand, human activities ceased to exist in periods of land and climate stabilities. With their increasing capacity to modify landscapes through time, human decisions and activities become equally important as climate change.

The first-order rate constant of sunlight photolysis (k(p)) for NP was estimated at 0.09 m2/(kWh). This corresponds to a half-life of 10-15 hours under continous clear sky, noon, summer sunlight in the surface layer of natural waters. The photolysis rate in the deeper layers is strongly attenuated, being approximately 1.5 times slower at depths of 20-25 cm than at the surface. The photochemical oxidation of NPnEO was shown to be significantly slower than that of NP. Additional laboratory experiments using a merry-go-round reactor (MGRR) have shown that the photochemical degradation of both NP and NPnEO was due mainly to sensitized photolysis whilst direct photolysis was comparatively slow. Moreover, experiments with D2O revealed that singlet oxygen was not an important photooxidant of NP at pH values usually found in natural waters.					; Giger, Walter/NXC-0612-2025	Ahel, Marijan/0000-0001-6923-8461; 													0045-6535					APR	1994	28	7					1361	1368		10.1016/0045-6535(94)90078-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(94)90078-7													WOS:A1994NP17900009

Relapsing Fever Group Borrelia in Southern California Rodents	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Wild rodent reservoir host species were surveyed prospectively for infection with Borrelia hermsii, the causative agent of tick-borne relapsing fever in the western United States. Trapping occurred during the summer of 2009-2012 at field sites surrounding Big Bear Lake, CA, a region where human infection has been reported for many years. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we tested 207 rodents from 11 species and found chipmunks (Tamias spp.) and a woodrat (Neotoma macrotis) infected. Chipmunks represented the majority of captures at these sites. Sixteen of the 207 (7.7%; CI = 4.6 12.4) animals were qPCR-positive for Borrelia spp. associated with relapsing fever, and of those, we obtained bacterial DNA sequences from eight. The phylogram made from these sequences depict a clear association with B. hermsii genomic group I. In addition, we identified an infection with Borrelia coriaceae in a Tamias merriami, a potentially nonpathogenic member of the tick-borne relapsing fever group. Our findings support the hypothesis that chipmunk species play an important role in the maintenance of Borrelia species that cause tick-borne relapsing fever in the western United States, and therefore the risk of infection to people.																			0022-2585	1938-2928				SEP	2014	51	5					1029	1034		10.1603/ME14021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME14021								25276933					WOS:000341644600018

Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) linked with denitrification has been proposed to be a previously overlooked sink of methane in freshwater environments. However, the occurrence and relevance of AOM coupled with denitrification in methane removal and, therefore, mitigating methane emissions in the environment is so far largely unquantified. We investigated methane oxidation processes in the water column at the seasonally stratified lake Fohnsee located in Southern Germany to determine the seasonal dynamics and to quantitatively describe the contribution of anaerobic and aerobic oxidation of methane removing CH4 from the water column throughout nearly one year. Vertical concentration profiles and corresponding stable isotope ratios of methane (613C) and nitrate (615N and 618O), together with dissolved oxygen concentrations were measured, and a numerical model was developed to evaluate whether anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled with denitrification is a key biogeochemical process at lake Fohnsee. Our data set together with the results of the numerical model revealed a redox zone within the water column where both denitrification and anaerobic oxidation of methane are linked, contributing to approximately 70% of methane removal between June and September. Therefore, AOM linked with denitrification represents the dominant methane sink in the water column of lake Fohnsee during summer stratification. The data patterns also showed that the anaerobic oxidation of methane zone was located near the lake bottom in May, and moved upwards following the seasonal vertical displacement of the oxycline and the availability of nitrate. This redox dynamic within the water column of lake Fohnsee had also an effect on the relevance of aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane removing methane from the water column during the year and the formation of a bacterial sulfate reduction zone close to the lake sediments.

A Comparison of Modified Fyke Nets for Evaluating Fish Assemblages and Population Structure	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Modified fyke nets have long been used by fisheries managers to assess species composition and evaluate population characteristics of individual species. Despite their widespread use, only recently have recommendations for standard fyke net specifications been made. Therefore, we evaluated species composition and catch rates, size structure, and sample size requirements for bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), black crappie (Pozomis nigromaculatus), and white crappie (P. annularis) in seven Iowa lakes in the fall of 2009 using two different fyke nets. Fyke net specifications followed a recently recommended standard design and that currently used by Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). Overall, the standard fyke net sampled more individuals and species than the IDNR net. Additionally, mean catch rates of the focal species were consistently higher with the standard fyke net. Size structure comparisons were limited by fewer than 125 stock-length fishes sampled in several lakes, but when comparison was possible, size structure was similar between the fyke net types. The number of samples needed to obtain at least 125 stock-length individuals with standard fyke nets was consistently lower than that for IDNR fyke nets for all species.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2010	25	4					555	563		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664405													WOS:000284243100008

The results showed that the N application rates had little impact on the soil mineral N around root, but increased the dry matter and N accumulation aboveground in the high fertility soil (55.3 mg kg(-1) of soil mineral N before rice season in 2008). However, no significant difference in grain yield was observed in all N treatments in these 3 years. Path analysis showed that spikelet per panicle made the greatest direct contribution (0.781) and total contribution (0.309) to grain yield compared to other yield components. And a higher panicle per m(2) and dry matter accumulation resulted in yield decline later in the season due to a decline in the percentage of filled grains. No significant increases in plant N uptake, regardless of N application rates, were observed at the seedling stage, which indicated that lower N application rates could suffice during the rice early growing stages. Nitrate contents, in spite of high N rates input, in the percolation water were all below 1.0 mg L-1 throughout the rice growing season. The increased N rates showed an increment of total N leaching through the percolation water, but not significant. The cumulative total N leaching only accounted for 1.86-4.96% of N fertilizer input, which suggested the N leaching should not be considered as main pollution resources in paddy filed in summer rice season. However, the evaluation of N leaching in different stages indicated that N leaching at seedling stage was larger in dominant (averaged 39.8% of total N leaching) than other stages. For the lower absorbing ability of rice seedling and more N leaching risk, suggestions on N fertilizer reduction should be made at rice early growing stage in this region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Survival of a submerged aquatic weed (Egeria densa) during lake drawdown within mounds of stranded vegetation	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake drawdown, or water withdrawal, is often used to control invasive submerged macrophytes; however, regrowth of the target species often occurs rapidly. A mechanism proposed to explain such unsatisfactory results is that as water recedes and submerged aquatic weeds become exposed to the air, mounds of stranded vegetation form on the dewatered lakebed. These mounds may insulate underlying weeds, creating an environment protected from desiccation and frost. This study tests this mechanism by comparing the viability of the submerged aquatic weed Egeria densa Planch. from within mounds to the viability on the surface of these mounds during a winter drawdown of Lake Mulwala, Australia. After 22 days of exposure, no stems on the surface of weed mounds were viable, but 22% of stems on the bottom of mounds and 76% of crowns under the mounds were viable. Further, after 34 days, 12% of stems and 32% of crowns collected from the bottom of the weed mounds were still viable. We conclude that, in areas of lakes that are exposed during drawdowns, regeneration from in situ stem fragments and crowns following refilling are an important potential source of reestablishment for E. densa.					butler, kym/D-5507-2014	butler, kym/0000-0002-1958-3942; Dugdale, Tony/0000-0001-9788-3185													0743-8141						2012	28	2					153	157		10.1080/07438141.2012.678928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2012.678928													WOS:000305515400005

Project 2005-0518 overlaid an existing 10 in (254 mm) jointed, reinforced, dowelled concrete pavement on I-90 in Lake County east of Cleveland, Ohio with a 9.5 in (241 mm) jointed, plain, dowelled concrete on a 1 in (25 mm) asphalt bondbreaker in 2005. After 6 or 7 years of service, the overlay on I-90 had shown premature cracks and corner breaks. Two likely causes are the cold climate in northern Ohio during construction and the presence of slag aggregate in the concrete mix. Field investigation included visual assessment, distress survey, falling weight deflectometer, MIT scan of dowel bars; and collection of core specimens. Laboratory testing included core dimensions, material mechanical properties, and petrographic analysis. A HIPERPAV simulation was conducted to evaluate early behavior of the Portland cement concrete overlay using actual daily temperature data. Recommendations were made to ODOT to improve performance and prevent similar failures in the future.

J	Dumayne-Peaty, L; Barber, K				Dumayne-Peaty, L; Barber, K			Late Holocene vegetational history, human impact and pollen representativity variations in northern Cumbria, England	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												The comparison of pollen diagrams and their inferred vegetational histories are an important component of palaeoecological research. Radiocarbon-dated pollen profiles from three cores taken from two adjacent mires located in northern Cumbria, Bolton Fell Moss and Walton Moss, have been used to reconstruct the Late Holocene vegetation history between the Bronze Age and the present day. The profiles have been interpreted in the light of available archaeological and historical records and, although the pollen records are broadly similar, there are some notable differences between them, particularly during Iron Age and medieval times. Dissimilarities between the diagrams are explored numerically, and the statistical and palynological results are discussed in relation to pollen representativity. The results suggest that it may be advantageous to construct more than one pollen diagram from a mire, or even adjacent mires, as extra-local pollen may be a more important part of the pollen rain than previously envisaged.

The history of global FWA production and use spans more than 60 years, but the environmental fate of FWAs has been less reported in the public literature and most studies predate 2000; in addition, the studied FWAs were still limited to FWA71 and FWA351. In this study, the occurrence and distribution of 9 commonly used FWAs in a lake in North China were reported for the first time. We found that 6 target FWAs were prevalent in the lake, and the concentration levels were usually at the ng L-1 level. Decreasing FWA levels with increasing distance from the estuary area were observed in summer. FWA135, FWA185, and FWA367, the most detected 3 FWAs, with the ecological risk at high levels, and sigma RQ >10 were obtained from all the investigated samples, suggesting that all the sampling sites could be considered with certain ecological risk for aquatic life. As a category of heavily and widely used dyes, FWAs in environmental media have been ignored for a long time. Substantial additional research needs to be conducted to determine the environmental behavior and ecological toxicology of FWAs.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				DEC 15	2021	291								118235	10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118235	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118235		SEP 2021						34582923					WOS:000704471600003

These calm, stable conditions were abruptly interrupted by a second extreme weather event, Atlantic Storm Hector, in late June. Using high-frequency monitoring data, coupled with fortnightly biological sampling, we show that the storm directly affected the stratification pattern of Lough Feeagh, resulting in an intense mixing event. The lake restabilised quickly after the storm as the heatwave continued. During the storm there was a three-fold reduction in Schmidt stability, with a mixed layer deepening of 9.5 m coinciding with a two-fold reduction in chlorophyll a but a three-fold increase in total zooplankton biomass. Epilimnetic respiration increased and net ecosystem productivity decreased. The ratio of total nitrogen:total phosphorus from in-lake versus inflow rivers was decoupled, leading to a cascade effect on higher trophic levels. A step change in nitrogen:phosphorus imbalances suggested that the zooplankton community shifted from phosphorus to nitrogen nutrient constraints. Such characterisations of both lake thermal and ecological responses to extreme weather events are relatively rare but are crucial to our understanding of how lakes are changing as the impacts of global climate change accelerate.					; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023; Calderó-Pascual, Maria/AAK-2837-2021; Kelly, Sean/K-3529-2013	McCarthy, Valerie/0000-0002-9169-2043; Jennings, Eleanor/0000-0002-9344-2056; de Eyto, Elvira/0000-0003-2281-2491; 														2073-4441				MAY	2020	12	5							1411	10.3390/w12051411	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12051411													WOS:000555915200190

The low pH before the flooding originated from acid mine drainage. A continuous inflow over the period of flooding and beyond could be suspected, as monimolimnia of different chemical composition of dissolved substances could establish and persist over the entire observation period at two deep locations of the lake. During summer, a thermal stratification of the water column allowed the neutral river water only to mix into the epilimnion, while the deeper water layers were not directly affected by the incoming waters. Hence a pronounced stratification of pH through the water column and differences between the separate basins could be observed. Winterly deep circulation could remove the vertical gradients of pH, except for the small volumina of the monimolimnia. By the end of year 2002, the entire lake was neutral with the exception of the small volumes of both monimolimnia.

J	Hu, J; Chi, SY; Hu, JX				Hu, Jun; Chi, Shiyun; Hu, Juxiang			An attempt to measure longitudinal connectivity based on the community structure of phytoplankton	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												At present, there are few studies on the quantitative analysis of connectivity from the perspective of biocenology. This study aimed to develop a new quantitative assessment method for river connectivity based on the analysis of the effect of river connectivity on the phytoplankton community in the Shaying River, which has multiple gates. The results showed that from the view of the phytoplankton density and biomass, cryptophytes were the dominant phytoplankton group, but the cyanobacteria density was highest in the summer. In the top 10 of degrees of dominance, there were 4 species of cyanobacteria, 3 species of cryptophytes, 2 species of diatoms, and 1 species of chlorophytes. Based on the seasonal compositions and variations of the phytoplankton community, the river barriers had a great effect on the community. The community composition of the Shaying River has been transformed from a river-type community dominated by diatoms to a lake-type community dominated by cyanophytes. PCA (principal component analysis) indicated that there were obvious differences in the community structure among the sections partitioned by various river gates. According to the relative positions of the entire phytoplankton community and the relative sequence of the river gates, a potential gradient representing the river connectivity can be found; thus, the river connectivity can be quantitatively described from the perspective of the phytoplankton community, and hereby, the corresponding quantitative methods can be established. Characterizing the connectivity of rivers based on biota will facilitate assessing the effects of multiple barriers and understanding river connectivity, and provide the support for the effective management of rivers.

J	Tahseen, S; Karney, B				Tahseen, Samiha; Karney, Bryan			Opportunities for increased hydropower diversion at Niagara: An sSWOT analysis	RENEWABLE ENERGY												Flows in the Niagara River are a pivotal resource that transcends the geographical boundary of Canada or the US. Every year the Niagara Falls attracts 12-14 million tourists while the river water, diverted in accordance with the 1950 Niagara River Treaty, is used for power generation and navigation purposes. The paper elaborates on the existing decision support frameworks by explicitly incorporate sustainability and shows how the new framework applies it to the strategic planning for the overall development of Niagara. The analysis sheds light on the current economic, environmental, social and political dynamics through the application of Sustainability SWOT (sSWOT) framework. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Analytical Network Process (ANP) are both used to identify a priority sequence among potential decision alternatives. The analysis shows that renegotiation of the 1950 Treaty is a preferred option over the current flow restrictions. This exploratory study does not attempt to forecast likely or advisable developments, but rather recommends further research on Niagara, ideally coupled with the opening of new discussions between Canada and the US.

Practically grasping the characteristics of local villages' sewage treatment demand, sewage flow and sewage quality has far-reaching significance for constructing suitable and efficient rural sewage treatment systems, and ultimately improving the water environment of the lake basin. To this end, the study conducted a field investigation in a typical village of the Taihu Lake Basin in July and continuously monitored sewage flow and sewage quality in the mode of sewage classification. The sewage quality test included chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP). This paper reviewed the development status of the typical village and demonstrated the rules of rural domestic water consumption and sewage discharge. It was found that the total sewage discharge flow in summer was around 88.90 L/(cap.d) and the hourly variation coefficient was around 3.92. Kitchen sewage, washing sewage, and toilet sewage had significant differences in sewage quality. Particularly, the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in toilet sewage were quite rich, accounting for 84.42% and 61.90% of the corresponding total load, respectively. Thus, the ideas of properties-classified treatment and resource treatment were worth being introduced into the rural sewage treatment process.																			1755-1307						2020	546								032031	10.1088/1755-1315/546/3/032031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/546/3/032031													WOS:000625346300091
C	Kaushik, NK		Reddy, MV		Kaushik, NK			Detergents and eutrophication of a temperate lake: Relevance for Indian aquatic environments	RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TROPICAL EUTROPHIC LAKES					International Workshop on Restoration and Management of Eutrophic Lakes	2001	Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA					A rapid increase in population and growth of industry and agriculature in the Lake Erie basin during 1920 to 1960 lead to dramatic increase in inputs of organic wastes and nutrients, especially in the western basin of the lake. By 1970 about half of the phosphorus loading was derived from detergents. Nutrient loading to Lake Erie was high and the western basin, which received about 74% of the total phosphorus load to the lake, was regarded as highly eutrophic. The western basin had phytoplankton biomass and taxa that were characteristic of eutrophic waters, with higher concentrations of chlorophyll a, higher primary production, and assimilation number. All eutrophic areas in Lake Erie with. submerged rocky substrates promoted a profuse growth of filamentous algae, especially Cladophora. This affected water intakes; drinking water supplies had the taste of rotting vegetation. Stench arising from decomposing Cladophora affected tourism and fishing. Beaches were deserted and thus eutrophication caused a massive economic loss. Microbial decomposition of large quantities of dead algae and other organisms lead to hypoxic and anoxic conditions in the hypolmmion during lake stratification. Whereas only 3% of hypolommion in the central basis was anoxic during the summer of 1930, the value had increased to 93.7% by 1973. Under anoxic conditions phosphorus adsorbed on to sediment is released back into water and after the fall overturn and mixing of waters it promotes algal blooms. Anoxic conditions in hypolinnetic water eliminated benthic organisms as well and some highly valued commerical and sport fish. In the mid 1960's, the media was inundated with features on pollution in Lake Erie and there was a tremendous public outcry both in Canada and the USA. By 1970, The International Joint Commission, initially asked to investigate the extent of pollution and to suggest remedial measures to stop eutrophication, had recommended a reduction in phosphates found in detergents as well those found in municipal sewage effluents. Following these recommendations some 30 years ago, phosphorus abatement programs in both Canada and the USA have had a significant impact on the oligotrophiciation of Lake Erie. At present, most of the laundry detergent sold in North America and many European countries are phosphate free, despite regulations that allow the use of small quantities of phosphates. In India, the quantity of detergent-based phosphorus entering aquatic systems is relatively small when compared to the amount entering from other sources. Hence, except for water bodies in which detergents are a major source of phosphorus, regulations on phosphates in detergents will not help the overall oligotrophication of eutrophic Indian environments. However, the input of phosphorus from detergents consititutes a substantial nutrient pollution, and the extent of this pollution is likely to increase steadily. This would promote the eutrophication of unpolluted downstream reaches and even of coastal waters. Controlling the phosphorus content of detergents in India is not likely to be expensive because two or three main detergent manufacturers control a major share of the detergents market. In view of these facts, it could be concluded that the quantity of phosphates present in detergents in India should be regulated.																					1-57808-370-2				2005							107	144																WOS:000235752400005

Despite the many types of aquatic habitats, there has been a limited study of the diatom flora. The purpose of this study is to present the diatom species and characterize their distribution in the Karaj River, which flows in Iran's Central Alborz region. The Alborz is one of the Irano-Anatolian ecoregions that serve as biodiversity hotspots. The Central Alborz, located in the middle part of this mountainous area, is an outstanding ecological and geological resource. This study uses the diatom flora to determine the biodiversity in one of the major rivers of the Central Alborz. Periphytic diatom samples were collected monthly from six stations along the length of the Karaj River between May 2011 and April 2012. A total of 128 diatom taxa was found from 48 genera expanding our understanding of regional aquatic diversity as 42 species are recorded as new for the diatom flora of Iran. Furthermore, the biogeography of the diatom flora of the Karaj River is considered in relation to the rest of Iran, the Middle East, and Asian and European diatom communities.

The community is dominated by a single species, "Thiopedia rosea", that inhibits the entire hypolimnion (6 to 8 m) for approximately 11 months, Suboptimal conditions in the hypolimnion (extremely low light intensity, high or low H2S levels) result in zero or extremely low growth rates (doubling time > 1 month) for most of the population, most of the time, yet cells remain viable and capable of high specific growth rates (doubling times of 1 to 10 days) when placed under favorable conditions (higher light intensities and temperatures). We first conclude that phototrophic bacterial populations in situ may frequently exist in a viable yet nongrowing state. Second, the viability of cells is likely to be reduced with depth owing to higher concentrations of potentially toxic chemicals and to changes in the physiological state associated with the prolonged periods of darkness commonly found at the bottom of bacterial plates.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				JAN	1989	55	1					78	85		10.1128/AEM.55.1.78-85.1989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.55.1.78-85.1989								16347839					WOS:A1989R627700014

We analyze beam irradiances of two horizontal pyranometers situated next to a lake, one facing upwards and one facing downwards, to estimate the contribution of Fresnel reflection to the beam irradiance on a vertical surface. We show that in general the observed beam irradiance on the downward facing instrument matches the calculated Fresnel reflection. In contrast to other studies investigating water albedo, we also found that the reflection percentage decreases consistently with higher wind speeds and lower solar zenith angle. Fresnel reflection has the highest contribution for vertical surfaces in winter, with varying contributions between <1% and >30% of monthly global irradiance over the course of one year for different latitudes, and should thus be included in yield estimates for building integrated PV installations situated next to bodies of water.

We assessed the future impact of 100years of tundra geomorphic change on peak growing season carbon exchange in response to: (i) landscape succession associated with the thaw-lake cycle; and (ii) low, moderate, and extreme scenarios of thermokarst pit formation (10%, 30%, and 50%) reported for Alaskan arctic tundra sites. We developed a 30x30m resolution tundra geomorphology map (overall accuracy:75%; Kappa:0.69) for our similar to 1800km(2) study area composed of ten classes; drained slope, high center polygon, flat-center polygon, low center polygon, coalescent low center polygon, polygon trough, meadow, ponds, rivers, and lakes, to determine their spatial distribution across the Barrow Peninsula. Land-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 flux data were collected for the summers of 2006-2010 at eighty-two sites near Barrow, across the mapped classes. The developed geomorphic map was used for the regional assessment of carbon flux. Results indicate (i) at present during peak growing season on the Barrow Peninsula, CO2 uptake occurs at -902.3 10(6)gC-CO(2)day(-1) (uncertainty using 95% CI is between -438.3 and -1366 10(6)gC-CO(2)day(-1)) and CH4 flux at 28.9 10(6)gC-CH(4)day(-1)(uncertainty using 95% CI is between 12.9 and 44.9 10(6)gC-CH(4)day(-1)), (ii) one century of future landscape change associated with the thaw-lake cycle only slightly alter CO2 and CH4 exchange, while (iii) moderate increases in thermokarst pits would strengthen both CO2 uptake (-166.9 10(6)gC-CO(2)day(-1)) and CH4 flux (2.8 10(6)gC-CH(4)day(-1)) with geomorphic change from low to high center polygons, cumulatively resulting in an estimated negative feedback to warming during peak growing season.

J	Grochowska, J; Teodorowicz, M				Grochowska, Jolanta; Teodorowicz, Mariusz			ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF DRAINAGE BASINS ON UPPER PASLEKA LAKES AND OF SUSCEPTIBILITY OF LAKES TO DEGRADATION	ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-FORMATIO CIRCUMIECTUS												The studies covered the Wymoj, Sarag, Leguty and Isag lakes with the Pasleka river flowing through, and their drainage basins. It was found that the lakes of upper Pasleka fall into degradability category II, i. e. they are moderately susceptible to eutrophi cation. Their drainage basins, having a great potential for supplying matter to the reservois, were included in basin category 4. The lakes with their drainage basins belong to the 2nd type of lake-drainage basin ecosystems in which the unfavourable basin conditions (high potential for solid matter supply) are balanced by the relatively high lake's resistance to external impacts. In such a system the natural eutrophication of the lake is expected to proceed at a moderate rate. The upper Pasleka lakes, however, show an accelerated rate of this process, which is mostly due to the high load of biogenic compounds supplied by the river and the intensive recreational use of the lakes.																			1644-0765						2006	5	1					99	111																WOS:000421179900009

Mortality by CyHV-3 disease has not been reported since 2011 in Kochi Prefecture, Japan. Here, we detected and quantified CyHV-3 in common carp inhabiting three rivers in the prefecture to examine if the carp are carriers of CyHV-3 as a source of infection. CyHV-3 DNA was detected in 16.7% (12/72) of brain samples in Kagami River, 3.9% (3/76) of brain and 3.9% (3/76) of gill samples in Monobe River, and 5.1% (4/79) of brain and 13% (1/79) of gill samples in Wajiki River. CyHV-3 genotypes identified in the 23 samples were classified as the J genotype A1 that has been found in Japan. The CyHV-3 DNA load did not differ statistically between sampling months, indicating that CyHV-3 has been silent in common carp, unlike Lake Biwa where the annual reactivation occurs in spring. Taken together, our results represented definitive evidence that seasonal changes in water temperature do not affect CyHV-3 activity in carp. Considering that infectious virus was not isolated from CyHV-3 DNA-positive samples, it was suggested that CyHV-3 establishes a latent infection in carp populations inhabiting Kagami River, Monobe River and Wajiki River. Further, the presence of circular or concatameric CyHV-3 DNA was detected in five of 23 CyHV-3 DNA-positive samples. Common carp inhabiting Lake Biwa were reported previously to harbor linear but not circular CyHV-3 DNA. This difference suggested that the CyHV-3 genome may be circularized for long-term maintenance without active viral replication. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These co-occurring dinoflagellate species may be taken to indicate that surface water temperatures must have been remarkably low for early Pliocene mid-latitudes, contrasting other indications that overall warm humid climates prevailed at this time. A multi-component study of this so-called 'dinolayer' with an astrochronologically derived age of 4.205 +/- 0.01 Ma was undertaken to further investigate the apparently contrasting climatic signals. Integrated sedimentological, micropaleontological, palynological and geochemical data indicate that the dinolayer was deposited in a shallow fresh water lake. The pollen record points to slightly cooler conditions during deposition of the dinolayer in comparison with conditions just below and above. An anomalously low winter temperature is proposed as a possible cause for the recorded phenomena. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Food and temperature were vertically homogenous and thus not important for the vertical distribution of vendace. The ultimate reason for migration of the juveniles might be the avoidance of vertebrate predators, such as birds and fishes like perch (Perca fluviatilis). To avoid predation juveniles spend daytime near the bottom where light is scarce and piscivores who search prey visually cannot find them. This behavior constitutes a response to changes in both feeding opportunities and predation risk at different depths during the diel cycle. Predator avoidance is not so important for the adult vendace because they have fewer predators in Lake Pyhajarvi than the juveniles. In late summer the adults may stay near the bottom because of high intraspecific competition by the YOY, too high water temperature or because of the physiological changes associated with the maturation of the gonads.

Most scoters arrived in early May about 30 days before the period of peak nest initiation. About 44% of the female scoters observed soon after first arrival were paired, but 96% were paired by 31 May. Peak numbers of pairs varied little among years and ranged from 389 to 423 scoter pairs during the third week of May each year. About 78% of the peak population left the lake by 31 July when broods were common. Nest success averaged 72.3% for all years and the mean date of hatch was 23 July. Nests with complete concealment had higher sucess rates than nests located in sparser cover (P < 0.025). Duckling mortality was higher during the first week after hatch, but numbers continued to decline during early and mid-August. Annual productivity never exceeded 0.5 duckling/breeding pair.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1989	103	2					240	247																WOS:A1989DQ48800014

Selective withdrawal optimization in a multipurpose water use reservoir	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Dam construction in arid and semiarid regions is generally related to the risk of increased salinity, due to water passage in contact with salty formations. Hence, it is important to take reservoir thermal and salinity stratification into account in operational rules. In the present study, a simulation-optimization model was developed to determine the amount of water release from various outlets to discharge the brine from hypolimnion layer considering the downstream water quality limitations. The most appropriate time, rate, and concentration to release brine were determined based on water consumption conditions and downstream water demand and river ecology characteristics. The proposed methodology was used to improve the water quality condition of Gotvand Dam constructed over Karun River in southwest Iran. The dissolution of the Gachsaran formation located in Gotvand Dam reservoir has gradually increased the salinity of hypolimnion layer water three times more than that of the seawater salinity. The results indicated that late winter is the most appropriate time to release brine water. If the brine water is not released, the very salty water gradually encompasses the epilimnion layer when the reservoir dead storage is filled with sediment. Results show that the TDS concentration of epilimnion layer gradually increases until 8000 mg/l by increasing the volume of reservoir sediments, which may be regarded as the source of economic, social, and environmental crisis.

Based on these new dating results as well as their cultural attributes, these sites could be confidently divided into four chronological phases (Phase 1: Late Yangshao and Majiayao culture; Phase 2: Qijia culture; Phases 3 and 4: Siwa culture) but a significant gap was identified at ca. 3600-3000 cal yr BP in this region. Comparison of this interval to high-resolution paleoclimate records from Tianchi Lake suggests it could be attributed to the dramatic drop in temperature at this time. Accordingly, archaeobotanical evidence with a refined chronology shows the adoption of cold-tolerant subsistence cereal grains such as barley on the NETP (Northeast Tibetan Plateau). Drawing from various lines of knowledge (chronology, palaeoclimate, archaeobotany, and archaeology), it is reasonable to conclude that, even when confronting a similar magnitude of climate change, local human societies could vary tremendously. Different subsistence strategies were brought in by the trans-Eurasia culture exchange of prehistoric times.

The levels of the metals in water were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Metal concentrations ranged from 0.11 to 4.29 mg/L for Cu(II) and 0.03 to 1.62 mg/L for Zn(II), which were both higher than those normally recorded in natural waters. The Cu(II) levels also exceeded WHO guidelines for drinking water in 27 % of the samples. The highest prevalence of excessive Cu(II) was found among dams and open pans (38 %), piped water (33 %) and spring water (25 %).

Linking terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems: The role of woody habitat in lake food webs	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Trees that fall into lakes from riparian forest become habitat for aquatic organisms, and are potentially an important link between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Coarse woody habitat (CWH) promotes the production of benthic invertebrate prey and offers refuge for prey fishes, which are in turn consumed by piscivorous fishes. We used a simulation model to explore responses of an aquatic food web to changes in CWH caused by lakeshore residential development and windstorm, as well as to harvest of adult piscivores. Residential development had a negative effect on fishes, and could lead to extirpation of benthivorous prey fish species. In contrast, pulsed addition of CWH following a windstorm had little effect on the aquatic food web. Our results suggest that CWH is more important as shelter for prey fishes than as a substrate for benthic invertebrate production. However, piscivore harvest can supersede the role of CWH as prey shelter, leading to piscivore collapse and prey persistence even when CWH levels are low enough to promote piscivore dominance. Thus, the effects of lakeshore residential development on fishes can be masked by angler harvest of top piscivores. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Our study of a museum collection from Tule Lake Rock Shelter (CA-SIS-218A) in the high Klamath Basin area supports Osborn's argument. We present nine high-precision accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon assays from a 2.5 m deep cultural sequence, demonstrating that Paleoindians occupied the site primarily during the Younger Dryas. Although only about .5 m(3) of the Paleoindian deposits at CA-SIS-218A were excavated, fragments of four small bone needles were recovered, three of which contain whole or partial eyes. Two fragments of large mammal cortical bone from the same levels contain remnants of "groove and snap" fractures that may be related to the production of needle blanks. The bone needles from Tule Lake Rock Shelter extend the geographic range of these distinctive Paleoindian artifacts into the high desert region of Northern California.

Ru-103 accumulation in the sediments began simultaneously with that of Cs-134 and a constant ratio (approx. 2.0 on a decay corrected basis) of Ru-103/Cs-137 was observed in surface waters and sediments throughout the measurement period. The ratio is not statistically different from that reported for atmospheric input and for epilimnetic water. The results suggest that the processes of removal of radioactive ruthenium and caesium from the mixed water column to the sediments are the same. Enhancement of Cs, compared with Ru, in the isolated bottom waters of one of the lakes in the summer months provided evidence for Cs release from the sediments during a period of hypolimnetic anoxia.

Regression of the lake with accompanying salinisation since about 4 cal. kyr BP allowed permafrost aggradation. Permafrost mounds and thermokarst features are inferred to have continued to develop in the last 60 years. Sections in two 6-10 m high unvegetated mounds revealed thick ice lenses and reticulate cryostructures leading to their classification as lithalsas. Mound collapse is induced by surface erosion and slumping, while sediment reworking by wave action and other processes appears to prevent rampart formation. If take levels continue to fall, further permafrost aggradation is expected in this high elevation enclosed basin. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

After ice-break, meltwater formed a stable surface layer which resulted in steep vertical gradients of temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration. This secondary chemocline persisted until August when it was detected at 4 m depth. Pronounced vertical differences were also observed for heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, rotifers, calanoid copepods, and growth rates of chemotrophic bacterioplankton. No strong correlation between the different components of the microbial loop was found but phytoplankton primary production and ciliates numbers were tightly correlated (r(2) = 0.649, p<0.001). Compared to phytoplankton biomass (<200 mgC.m(-2)), the biomass of bacterioplankton in the epilimnion measured in autumn was more than one order of magnitude higher (up to 5.650 mgC.m(-2)) and chemoheterotrophic bacterial production exceeded photosynthesis by a factor of 7.1. By comparison, the biomasses of flagellates and ciliates remained very low throughout the year (maxima, 5.52 and 3.4 mgC.m(-2)) whereas that of the calanoid copepod Diaptomus connexus rose to unexpected high levels (681 mgC.m(-2)), parallel to the increase in biomass of aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacteria. Calanoid copepods represent the highest trophic level in the planktonic food web of this fishless lake. Taken together our results indicated an unusual pattern of carbon flow in Mahoney Lake. Maximum rates of carbon transfer through the microbial loop and the grazing food chain were determined by radiolabeling techniques at four times. The efficiency of organic carbon transfer from chemotrophic bacteria to zooplankton was 3 to 12 %, while the transfer efficiency from phytoplankton, reached 117 %. As a result, carbon fluxes to higher trophic levels through the microbial loop and the conventional grazing food chain were similar. A comparison of the carbon supply and demand revealed that additional food sources of zooplankters must exist in Mahoney Lake. Concomitantly to the autumnal increase in chemotrophic bacterial and zooplankton biomass, a massive upwelling of the purple sulfur bacterium Amoebobacter purpureus from the chemocline into the mixolimnion was observed. Several lines of evidence indicate that the carbon fixed by anoxygenic photosynthesis is a direct, significant food supply for higher trophic levels in the oxic part of Mahoney Lake.

J	Dux, AM; Guy, CS; Fredenberg, WA				Dux, Andrew M.; Guy, Christopher S.; Fredenberg, Wade A.			Spatiotemporal Distribution and Population Characteristics of a Nonnative Lake Trout Population, with Implications for Suppression	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the distribution and population characteristics of nonnative lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake McDonald, Glacier National Park, Montana, to provide biological data in support of a potential suppression program. Using ultrasonic telemetry, we identified spatial and temporal distribution patterns by tracking 36 adult lake trout (1,137 relocations). Lake trout rarely occupied depths greater than 30 m and were commonly located in the upper hypolimnion directly below the metalimnion during thermal stratification. After breakdown of the metalimnion in the fall, lake trout primarily aggregated at two spawning sites. Lake trout population characteristics were similar to those of populations within the species' native range. However, lake trout in Lake McDonald exhibited lower total annual mortality (13.2%), later maturity (age 12 for males, age 15 for females), lower body condition, and slower growth than are typically observed in the southern extent of their range. These results will be useful in determining where to target suppression activities (e. g., gillnetting, trap-netting, or electrofishing) and in evaluating responses to suppression efforts. Similar evaluations of lake trout distribution patterns and population characteristics are recommended to increase the likelihood that suppression programs will succeed.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2011	31	2					187	196		10.1080/02755947.2011.562765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2011.562765													WOS:000290428800001
J	Hoover, SM; Hill, RA; Watson, TA				Hoover, SM; Hill, RA; Watson, TA			Exposure of aboriginals in British Columbia to methylmercury in freshwater fish: A comparison to reference doses and estimated thresholds	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												We have analyzed the methylmercury exposures of native women consuming fish from a reservoir and two lakes in British Columbia. Probability density functions representing methylmercury dose were generated using reasonable distributions for exposure parameters. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of alternative parameter values on the exposure estimates. The effect of ignoring variability and uncertainty in exposure was also assessed. Calculated mean daily doses of methylmercury for the target populations were compared to the estimated average dose for the general population. We also determined the percentages of the native women populations with exposures exceeding current guidance values as well as published thresholds for neurological effects. The analysis demonstrates the importance of better characterizing the low dose effects of methylmercury, as the predicted doses fall in the range of recommended maximum daily doses but well below the higher estimates of the effect threshold.

Both flows are perpendicular to the shoreline. The flow pattern near two separated saline lakes is more complicated. For example, in the Middle East, the Dead Sea northern basin and the evaporation ponds of the Dead Sea Works are adjacent to each other but separated. The northern basin level is dropping by 1.1 m/year and the evaporation ponds' levels are increasing by 0.2 m/year. The fresh-saline water interface in such situation is numerically simulated. Streamlines parallel or semiparallel to the shoreline are significant. Moreover, the fresh-saline water interface intrudes landward adjacent to the higher saline lake and is pushed lakeward adjacent to the lower saline lake. The simulation results support field observations showing that the interface migrates vertically at a faster rate relative to the changes in the water table and the lake levels.					; Shalev, Eyal/K-5615-2017; Yechieli, Yoseph/ABA-5546-2020	Levy, Yehuda/0009-0003-2794-2540; Levy, Yehuda/0000-0001-7095-4350													1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2021	29	5					1785	1795		10.1007/s10040-021-02348-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-021-02348-6		APR 2021											WOS:000642043900002

Superimposed on precession-controlled cycles, palynological time-series data reveal a higher-order climatic cyclicity with periodicities of similar to 10, similar to 2.5, and similar to 1.5 ka. These millennial-scale vegetation changes are likely to reflect changes of the soil-moisture gradient on mountain slopes, caused by fluctuations in orographic winter-precipitation. Such fluctuations corroborate the concept of a NAO-like North Atlantic climatic teleconnection during Early Pliocene times. The periodicities are similar to those of climate oscillations inferred from Quaternary records. The occurrence of millennial-scale cyclicity in a time interval when the Northern Hemisphere was essentially ice-free, implies an ultimate forcing mechanism that operated independently of changes in the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. The cycles are likely to be related to long-period variations in solar activity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Modeling future dissolved oxygen and temperature profiles in small temperate lake trout lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Climate warming has been projected to alter the habitat ranges of cold-water fish species. To numerically model these changes, a simple dissolved oxygen (DO) sub-model has been embedded into a one-dimensional thermodynamic lake-tile model that simulates small unresolved lakes within the land surface scheme of a climate model. To account for the lack of monitoring data for most small lakes, the components of the DO budget were parameterized as functions of lake surface area and depth, a light extinction coefficient and meteorological variables prescribed by the climate model. The model predicted the temperature and DO profiles with root-mean-square error < 1.5 degrees C and < 3 mg l(-1), respectively, based on 38 years of data from two Canadian Shield lakes. For the smaller lake (similar to 71 ha), simulations of future (2071-2100) lake conditions show a warming-induced reduction in the frequency of seasonal lake turnover and consequently prolonged periods of hypolimnetic hypoxia. This will reduce the end-of-summer volume weighted hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration (VWHO) from similar to 6 mg l(-1) (1978-2005) to < 3.6 mg l(-1) (2071-2100), below the 7 mg l(-1) standard for lake trout. As a result, the height of water column with temperatures and DO concentrations suitable for lake trout will decrease from similar to 17 m to < 6 m. For the larger lake (similar to 614 ha), VWHO < 5 mg l(-1) is predicted in the future; however, vertical mixing during turnover events and warming-induced shallowing of the thermocline depth will combine to increase the height of the suitable water column from similar to 16 m to > 18 m in the future. Hence, the lake trout populations in smaller temperate lakes may be at greater risk for earlier extirpation than in larger lakes.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2025	87	1							8	10.1007/s00027-024-01139-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01139-x													WOS:001349555100002
J	Gasiorowski, M; Sienkiewicz, E				Gasiorowski, Michal; Sienkiewicz, Elwira			The Little Ice Age recorded in sediments of a small dystrophic mountain lake in southern Poland	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We inferred the temperature and environmental conditions of Smreczynski Staw Lake in the Tatra Mountains, southern Poland, from a sediment record covering the last 1,500 years. Paleobiological methods (cladocera, chironomid, and diatom analyses) were used together with sedimentological analysis and dating. These studies provide new information about the timing and character of climate fluctuations during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The Medieval Warm Period ended in the Tatra region at the beginning of the thirteenth century, followed by the first episode of the LIA. The LIA was a relatively long but unstable period. The first part of the LIA was cold in the Tatra Mountains, without evidence of increasing precipitation, while the second part, after AD 1540, was cold and humid. The LIA terminated in the Tatra Mountains at the beginning of the twentieth century, although some aspects of its climatic and sedimentological regime continued until the 1920s. We also found some evidence of warming and acidification during the twentieth century.

Suspended matter was sampled at 13 different stations, and was found to have a highly variable carbon stable isotope composition, with delta C-13 values ranging overall between -30.94 and -19.18 parts per thousand, and a highly variable elemental (C:N) composition. Our data suggest that the phytoplankton component has a seasonally and spatially variable delta C-13 signature, which is surpressed by the terrestrial signal but may at times fall in the same range as the delta C-13 of the allochtonous matter. It is argued that the phytoplankton delta C-13 decreases after the onset of the monsoon rains, most Likely due to the C-13-depletion of the DIC pool caused by the microbial respiration of the allochtonous organic matter. At each of the 4 sites selected for concurrent zooplankton sampling, the zooplankton showed a much wider range of delta C-13 than did the suspended matter, with overall delta C-13 values between -30.14 and -16.45 parts per thousand. In addition, spatial differences in average delta C-13 were much more pronounced for zooplankton than for total suspended matter. These data indicate that zooplankton feed on a component of the suspended matter pool, which has more pronounced seasonal and spatial delta C-13 variations than the total suspended matter. Thus, despite the large amounts of terrestrial and mangrove detritus present in the water column, the locally produced phytoplankton appears to be a more important carbon source for the zooplankton.

Terrestrial laser scanning observations of geomorphic changes and varying lava lake levels at Erebus volcano, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												A Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) instrument was used to image the topography of the Main Crater at Erebus volcano each December in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Our high-spatial resolution TLS scans provide unique insights into annual and decadal scale geomorphic evolution of the summit area when integrated with comparable data collected by an airborne instrument in 2001. We observe both a pattern of subsidence within the Inner Crater of the volcano and an similar to 3 m per-year drop in the lava lake level over the same time period that are suggestive of decreasing overpressure in an underlying magma reservoir. We also scanned the active phonolite lava lake hosted within the Inner Crater, and recorded rapid cyclic fluctuations in the level of the lake. These were sporadically interrupted by minor explosions by bursting gas bubbles at the lake surface. The TLS data permit calculation of lake level rise and fall speeds and associated rates of volumetric change within the lake. These new observations, when considered with prior determinations of rates of lake surface motion and gas output, are indicative of unsteady magma flow in the conduit and its associated variability in gas volume fraction.

This disease was observed in Fall 2002 on 'Palestrina' azalea in Italy. Severe outbreaks of this disease were recently observed on several cultivars of azalea grown in nurseries located in the Verbano-Cusio-Ossola Province in the Piedmont region of northern Italy. Information on susceptibility to C acutatum among azalea cultivars currently grown in Italy was unavailable. Artificial inoculations were performed to evaluate the susceptibility of 70 evergreen azalea cultivars produced in the Lake Maggiore area. Sixty of the cultivars evaluated failed to develop disease symptoms and were considered resistant to C acutatum. Symptomatic cultivars were placed into three susceptibility classes. The cultivars Addy Wery, Fior di Pesco Cavadini, Geisha Orangerot, Kermesina, Orion, Palestrina, and Snow developed severe anthracnose symptoms. The cultivars Conversation Piece, Eikan, and Martha Hitchcock showed moderate susceptibility.																			1063-0198					OCT-DEC	2007	17	4					501	504		10.21273/HORTTECH.17.4.501	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.17.4.501													WOS:000249637600013

Recent warming reverses forty-year decline in catastrophic lake drainage and hastens gradual lake drainage across northern Alaska	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lakes represent as much as similar to 25% of the total land surface area in lowland permafrost regions. Though decreasing lake area has become a widespread phenomenon in permafrost regions, our ability to forecast future patterns of lake drainage spanning gradients of space and time remain limited. Here, we modeled the drivers of gradual (steady declining lake area) and catastrophic (temporally abrupt decrease in lake area) lake drainage using 45 years of Landsat observations (i.e. 1975-2019) across 32 690 lakes spanning climate and environmental gradients across northern Alaska. We mapped lake area using supervised support vector machine classifiers and object based image analyses using five-year Landsat image composites spanning 388 968 km(2). Drivers of lake drainage were determined with boosted regression tree models, using both static (e.g. lake morphology, proximity to drainage gradient) and dynamic predictor variables (e.g. temperature, precipitation, wildfire). Over the past 45 years, gradual drainage decreased lake area between 10% and 16%, but rates varied over time as the 1990s recorded the highest rates of gradual lake area losses associated with warm periods. Interestingly, the number of catastrophically drained lakes progressively decreased at a rate of similar to 37% decade(-1) from 1975-1979 (102-273 lakes draining year(-1)) to 2010-2014 (3-8 lakes draining year(-1)). However this 40 year negative trend was reversed during the most recent time-period (2015-2019), with observations of catastrophic drainage among the highest on record (i.e. 100-250 lakes draining year(-1)), the majority of which occurred in northwestern Alaska. Gradual drainage processes were driven by lake morphology, summer air and lake temperature, snow cover, active layer depth, and the thermokarst lake settlement index (R (2) (adj) = 0.42, CV = 0.35, p < 0.0001), whereas, catastrophic drainage was driven by the thawing season length, total precipitation, permafrost thickness, and lake temperature (R (2) (adj) = 0.75, CV = 0.67, p < 0.0001). Models forecast a continued decline in lake area across northern Alaska by 15%-21% by 2050. However these estimates are conservative, as the anticipated amplitude of future climate change were well-beyond historical variability and thus insufficient to forecast abrupt 'catastrophic' drainage processes. Results highlight the urgency to understand the potential ecological responses and feedbacks linked with ongoing Arctic landscape reorganization.

Here we report a 10,000 year quantitative record of annual mean temperature (T-ann), based on pollen-climate transfer functions and pollen-stratigraphical data from Lake Flarken, south-central Sweden. The pollen-based temperature reconstruction is compared with a reconstruction of effective humidity, as reflected by a delta O-18 record obtained on stratigraphy of lacustrine carbonates from Lake Igelsjon, c. 10 km from Lake Flarken, which gives evidence of pronounced changes in effective humidity. The relatively low T-ann, and high effective humidity as reflected by a low evaporation/inflow ratio suggest a maritime early Holocene climate (10,000-8,300 cat year BP), seemingly incompatible with the highly seasonal solar insolation configuration. We argue that the maritime climate was due to the stronger-than-present zonal flow, enhanced by the high early Holocene sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. The maritime climate mode was disrupted by the abrupt cold event at 8,200 cat year BP, followed at 8,000 cat year BP by a stable Holocene Thermal Maximum. The latter was characterized by T-ann values about 2.5 degrees C higher than at present and markedly dry conditions, indicative of stable summertime anti-cyclonic circulation, possibly corresponding with modern blocking anticyclonic conditions. The last 4,300 year period is characterized by an increasingly cold, moist, and unstable climate. The results demonstrate the value of combining two independent palaeoclimatic proxies in enhancing the reliability, generality, and interpretability of the palaeoclimatic results. Further methodological refinements especially in resolving past seasonal climatic contrasts are needed to better understand the role of different forcing factors in driving millennial-scale climate dynamics.					; Hammarlund, Dan/B-9698-2008	Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955; Hammarlund, Dan/0000-0001-7147-8173													0930-7575	1432-0894				AUG	2005	25	2-3					285	297		10.1007/s00382-005-0024-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-005-0024-5													WOS:000231853700010

To investigate the photosynthetic phytoplankton communities, conservative encoding gene of RubisCO large subunit (rbcL) was chosen as a target gene in this study. We constructed 33 clone libraries from samples collected in the north of South China Sea (NSCS) and retained 3173 sequences for further analysis. Results of BLASTp showed Stramenopiles and Haptophyta were predominant taxonomic groups in this area, while only five harmful species of Dinophyta were observed. According to the estimators of biodiversity, the photosynthetic community of N709 had very low genetic diversity and richness, which could be explained by the influence of brackish estuarine environment. Beta diversity showed that all samples could be clustered into three groups and those samples with approximately the same distance to land clustered together. Temperature, depth, and latitude of stations as biogeographic factors were indicated to have a significantly positive or negative relation with biodiversity estimators of the phytoplankton community. We concluded that biogeographic factors could be linked with difference in diversity and population of natural phytoplankton assemblages in horizontal surface of NSCS in summer 2007.

Isotopic biosignatures in carbonate-rich, cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mats of the Cariboo Plateau, BC	GEOBIOLOGY												Photosynthetic activity in carbonate-rich benthic microbial mats located in saline, alkaline lakes on the Cariboo Plateau, B.C. resulted in pCO(2) below equilibrium and C-13(DIC) values up to +6.0 parts per thousand above predicted carbon dioxide (CO2) equilibrium values, representing a biosignature of photosynthesis. Mat-associated C-13(carb) values ranged from similar to 4 to 8 parts per thousand within any individual lake, with observations of both enrichments (up to 3.8 parts per thousand) and depletions (up to 11.6 parts per thousand) relative to the concurrent dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Seasonal and annual variations in C-13 values reflected the balance between photosynthetic C-13-enrichment and heterotrophic inputs of C-13-depleted DIC. Mat microelectrode profiles identified oxic zones where C-13(carb) was within 0.2 parts per thousand of surface DIC overlying anoxic zones associated with sulphate reduction where C-13(carb) was depleted by up to 5 parts per thousand relative to surface DIC reflecting inputs of C-13-depleted DIC. C-13 values of sulphate reducing bacteria biomarker phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were depleted relative to the bulk organic matter by similar to 4 parts per thousand, consistent with heterotrophic synthesis, while the majority of PLFA had larger offsets consistent with autotrophy. Mean C-13(org) values ranged from -18.7 +/- 0.1 to -25.3 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand with mean C-13(inorg-org) values ranging from 21.1 to 24.2 parts per thousand, consistent with non-CO2-limited photosynthesis, suggesting that Precambrian C-13(org) values of similar to-26 parts per thousand do not necessitate higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Rather, it is likely that the high DIC and carbonate content of these systems provide a non-limiting carbon source allowing for expression of large photosynthetic offsets, in contrast to the smaller offsets observed in saline, organic-rich and hot spring microbial mats.

Modeling Enterococcus densities measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and membrane filtration using environmental conditions at four Great Lakes beaches	WATER RESEARCH												Data collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the summer months of 2003 and 2004 at four US Great Lakes beaches were analyzed using linear regression analysis to identify relationships between meteorological, physical water characteristics, and beach characteristics data and the fecal indicator bacteria, Enterococcus. Water samples were analyzed for Enterococcus densities by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and membrane filtration (MF). This paper investigates the ability of regression models to accurately predict Enterococcus densities above or below a threshold value, using environmental data on a beach-by-beach basis for both methods. The ability to create statistical models for real-time water quality analysis would allow beach managers to make more accurate decisions regarding beach safety. Results from linear regression models indicate that environmental factors explain more of the variability in Enterococcus densities measured by MF than Enterococcus densities measured by qPCR. Results also show that models for both methods did not perform well at predicting occurrences in which water quality levels exceeded a threshold. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that 50 species of macrobenthos were identified, belonging to 3 phyla, 7 classes, 15 orders and 32 families, mainly arthropods (37 species) and mollusks (11 species). Argyroneta aquatica, Chlaznius sp., dragonfly nymphs, Palaemon modestus, Radix auricularia, Cyraulus albus and Suecinea sp. were the dominant species in the whole study region; most of these are pollution-tolerant and moderately tolerant species. The macrobenthos density and biomass ranged from 10 to 577 ind./m(2) and from 0.0907 to 50.0562 g/m(2), respectively, showing high spatial heterogeneity.

Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the spatial heterogeneity of the macrobenthos was affected by the water temperature and the total nitrogen and total phosphorus in sediments (P < 0.05).					娟娟, 刘/AAH-7366-2019; Liu, Wei/GRX-3541-2022														2709-8028	2709-8036				AUG	2021	70	5					710	730		10.2166/aqua.2021.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2021.022		JUN 2021											WOS:000674408200001

High-resolution fluvial records of Holocene environmental changes in the Sahel: the Yame River at Ounjougou (Mali, West Africa)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Yame river, in the Bandiagara Plateau, Dogon Country, Mali, is characterised by extensive alluvial sedimentary records, particularly in the 1 km long Ounjougou reach where Holocene floodplain pockets are inset in the Pleistocene formations. These alluvial records have been investigated via geomorphologic fieldwork and sedimentologic and micromorphologic analyses and are supported by 79 radiocarbon dates. The alluvial deposits of the valley floor correspond to a vertical accretion of 3-10 m. The reconstruction of fluvial style changes provides evidence of four main aggradation periods. From 11,500 to 8760 cal. BP, the alluvial architecture and grain-size parameters indicate a wandering river. This period included phases of pulsed high-energy floods and avulsion related to a northward shift of the summer monsoon to around 14 degrees N after 11,500 cal. BP. From 7800 to 5300 cal. BP, a swampy floodplain environment with standing water pools within a Sudanian savanna/woodland mosaic corresponds to the culmination of the Holocene humid period. From 3800 cal. BP onwards, rhythmic sedimentation attests to an increase in the duration and/or intensity of the dry season, giving a precise date for the local termination of the Holocene Optimum period. During the last two millennia and for the first time during the Holocene, the alluvial formations are progressively restricted whereas the colluvial deposits increase, indicating strong soil erosion and redeposition within the watershed related to an increase in human impact. Four major periods are characterised by incision (I1: ante 11,500, I2: 8760-7800; I3: 6790-6500 cal. BP; I4; 2400-1700 cal. BP) pointing to dramatic changes in fluvial style. They result from high-energy flood flows during dry spells and confirm the capacity of the floodplain pocket in the upstream reach of the Sahelian belt to record rapid Holocene climatic change.

J	Anderson, RS				Anderson, Robert S.			Purealus beckelorum, a new genus and species of cleonine weevil from western Texas and eastern New Mexico (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Lixinae, Cleonini)	ZOOKEYS												The new genus Purealus Anderson (type species, Purealus beekelorum gen n. et sp. n., type locality: McKenzie Lake, Gaines County, Texas) is described to accommodate a new species of cleonine weevil from western Texas and eastern New Mexico. Habitus images and images of taxonomically significant structures are presented. Purealus appears to be unique within Cleonini in the distinctly tumescent and asperate base of elytral interval 3, and widely separated procoxae, two characters apparently not shared with any other world Cleonini. The species cannot be placed in either Apleurus or Scaphommphus due to a combination of characters in part shared by each genus and the lack of characters used to define the monophyly of each genus. Coding of the character states and addition to the analysis presented in a recent comprehensive analysis of world Cleonini did not provide any significant information on phylogenetic affinities. No information on plant associations is available; most specimens have been collected walking on the ground in winter months in arid habitats.																			1313-2989	1313-2970				SEP 13	2018		785					1	10		10.3897/zookeys.785.26674	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.785.26674								30271240					WOS:000444638200001

Aridity in the monsoon zone as indicated by desert dune formation in the Gregory Lakes basin, northwestern Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Desert dunes within the monsoon-fed Gregory Lakes basin form valuable archives for Quaternary paleoenvironments, in a region where such records are scarce. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronologies from two dunes identify the timing of eolian processes, interpreted as a complex response to aridification and increased sediment availability during lake transgressions and associated fluvial activity. The earliest eolian deposition in our record occurred ca 91.5 ka, which postdates the last 'mega-lake' phase but predates a smaller lake transgression during early MIS 3. Sand plain accretion took place around ca 47 ka during contemporaneous periodic high lake levels. This was followed by intermittent linear dune building, between ca 35 and 11.5 ka, which most likely took place during an interval of relative aridity. Close spacing of mid-Holocene ages within one dune indicates rapid sediment accumulation in a single arid event ca 5 ka. At no time in the last 50 ka have lake levels reached those of the last 'mega-lake' phase prior to ca 91.5 ka, suggesting a substantially weakened present-day monsoon.

Lake breezes in the southern Great Lakes region and their influence during BAQS-Met 2007	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Meteorological observations from the BAQS-Met field experiment during the summer months of 2007 were integrated and manually analyzed in order to identify and characterize lake breezes in the southern Great Lakes region of North America, and assess their potential impact on air quality. Lake breezes occurred frequently, with one or more lake breezes identified on 90% of study days. They affected all parts of the study region, including southwestern Ontario and nearby portions of southeast Lower Michigan and northern Ohio, with lake-breeze fronts occasionally penetrating from 100 km to over 200 km inland. Occurrence rates and penetration distances were found to be higher than previously reported in the literature. This comprehensive depiction of observed lake breezes allows an improved understanding of their influence on the transport, dispersion, and production of pollutants in this region. The observational analyses were compared with output from subsequent runs of a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model. The model accurately predicted lake breeze occurrence and type in a variety of synoptic wind regimes, but selected cases showed substantial differences in the detailed timing and location of lake-breeze fronts, and with the initiation of deep moist convection. Knowledge of such strengths and weaknesses aids in the interpretation of results from air quality models driven by this meteorological model.

J	Myanganbuu, N; Yamkhin, J				Myanganbuu, Nyamkhuu; Yamkhin, Jambaljav			NEW DATA ON PERMAFROST AND CRYOGENIC LANDFORMS OF THE DARKHAD DEPRESSION	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												The Darkhad depression is one of the largest intermountain depressions, like Baikal, in northern Mongolia covering an area of about 3320 km(2). The Darkhad depression climate is extreme continental, with lasting cold dry winters and warm dry summers. The average annual temperature is negative, -6 C-circle, the mean annual air temperature in January is negative, -32,0 C-circle, the lowest temperature is observed in January and reaches -50.4 C-circle. Cooling in the Darkhad depression starts from the 10th of August and lasts until mid-June, so duration of the cold and cool period of the year is 290-310 days. Annual precipitation on average is 260-270 mm. Harsh climatic conditions contribute to the preservation of permafrost. The Darkhad depression is located in the developmental zone of continuous permafrost rocks. The average thickness of permafrost in sediments in the Darkhad depression is between 83.7-97.8 m and the maximum reaches 183.7 m. But soil temperature regime and cryogenic processes have been poorly studied so far. The aim of the work is the characteristics of temperature regime of the permafrost top part and cryogenic landforms. Extensive data on morphology, morphometry and geologic structure of frost swelling mound was collected by the author when participating in the group of the Institute of Geography named after Sh. Tsegmid of Mongolian Academy of Sciences. Cryolithozone temperature conditions were studied. In the laboratory period the collected field data processing and interpretation of space photographs were carried out as well as data from previous studies were involved. The conducted geometrical studies revealed significant fluctuations in temperature of rocks on the surface and in the depth of 1 to 15 m. Especially, large variations in temperature of rocks are typical for the surface, where the maximum temperature of the rocks vary from +35.74 C-circle to +40.89 C-circle. The average annual temperature of the surface layer of rocks ranges from -1.79 C-circle to 4.04 C-circle, the lowest of which is typical for the northern parts of the territory. In order to study the dynamics of thermokarst lakes in 1991-2010 within the Darkhad depression the author made a comparative analysis of space photographs and statistical data processing to modify areas of thermokarst lakes derived from the satellite measurements. As a result, during the study period the surface area of small (5-10 ha) thermokarst lakes varied and amounted to 663.1 ha, increased by 100.4 ha, lakes area (1050 ha) also experienced fluctuations, but as a whole, in 2010 decreased by 229 ha and the total surface of lakes with the area over 100 ha, increased by 360.8 ha. The smallest increment of lake surface is observed for the lake with the area of 50-100 ha -10.4 ha. Thus, a decrease in the temperature of the surface layer of the lithosphere and development of thermokarst lakes in natural landscapes currently characterizes the Darkhad depression. Economic development will contribute to the development of thermokarst, particularly in the areas of continuous development of permafrost rocks.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				OCT	2014		387					253	256		10.17223/15617793/387/37	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/15617793/387/37													WOS:000421004600037

Model tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of high-flow air curtains to deflect ice pushed ahead of vessels entering the 366-m-long Poe Lock. A series of air curtains and an array of point source bubblers were also tested to break ice jams in the upper approach of the adjacent MacArthur Lock. In addition, an array of high-flow point source bubblers was developed in the model to relieve ice congestion in front of the downstream miter gates of the Poe Lock. A model water cannon was also found effective for clearing ice in front of miter gates and breaking jams in the upper lock approach.																			0315-1468					DEC	2000	27	6					1207	1216																WOS:000166008700011
J	Ridgway, MS; Middel, TA				Ridgway, Mark S.; Middel, Trevor A.			Distribution, relative abundance, and prey demand by double-crested cormorants on Manitoulin Island lakes vs. Lake Huron Coast	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An aerial distance sampling survey of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) was conducted in the northern region of Lake Huron (North Channel; four largest lakes of Manitoulin Island; South Shore of Manitoulin Is. facing the main body of the lake) to assess the relative distribution, abundance and prey demand by cormorants on inland lake vs. coastal habitat. On a per area basis, the density (approx. 1-2 cormorants.km(-2)) and prey demand (approx. 1.2 kg ha(-1)) of cormorants in the four inland lakes matched that of the North Channel. The South Shore had approximately half the density and prey demand as the other two areas. Cormorants on the inland lakes of Manitoulin Island represented 13% early in the season and a high of 33% of the total population for this region of Lake Huron later in the summer. Estimating regional distributions of cormorants within the Great Lakes basin is important because mapped nest colonies and nest counts are not representative of the actual distribution of foraging cormorants during and after the nesting season. There are two general conclusions to emerge from this survey. First, aquatic productivity from both Great Lakes coast and inland lakes contributes to trends in population and distribution of cormorants in the northern region of Lake Huron and perhaps elsewhere. Second, inland aquatic ecosystems are important throughout a season for foraging cormorants from the Great Lakes and may become more important as Great Lake productivity trends downward.

J	Jin, ZD; An, ZS; Yu, JM; Li, FC; Zhang, F				Jin, Zhangdong; An, Zhisheng; Yu, Jimin; Li, Fuchun; Zhang, Fei			Lake Qinghai sediment geochemistry linked to hydroclimate variability since the last glacial	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Geochemistry of basin sediments from semi-arid regions is valuable to understand past hydroclimatic changes. Here, we investigate the links of sedimentary geochemistry (Rb, Sr, Ca/Zr, TOC, and %CaCO3), carbonate mineralogy and ostracod shell delta O-18 of Lake Qinghai, a basin proximal to major dust production centers at mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, to changes in depositional conditions and hydroclimate during the past 32 ka. Surface lacustrine sediments are characterized by low-Rb, high-Sr, low-Rb/Sr, high-%CaCO3 and high-Ca/Zr values, in contrast to the chemical compositions of eolian loess (high-Rb, low-Sr, high-Rb/Sr, low-%CaCO3, and low-Ca/Zr). A direct comparison of soluble Ca and Sr in two short cores with instrumental water discharge data suggests that lacustrine precipitates in Lake Qinghai are dominated by authigenic aragonite formed under Ca2+-limited water conditions, and that the accumulation rate of aragonite dominantly depends on solute fluxes into the lake during the rainy seasons (late May to September). Our high-resolution down-core records show that sediments during the last glacial (similar to 32-19.8 ka) had high-Rb, low-Sr, low-%CaCO3, and low-Ca/Zr, indicating eolian dust (loess) accumulation in a desiccated basin under dry glacial conditions, further supported by grain size and pollen results. This type of sedimentation was maintained during the last deglacial (similar to 19.8-11.5 ka), but interrupted by episodic lacustrine precipitates with high-Sr, high-%CaCO3, high-Ca/Zr, and low-Rb. At similar to 11.5 ka, sedimentary Rb/Sr, Ca/Zr, %CaCO3 and TOC show dramatic and permanent changes, implying an abrupt shift in the atmospheric circulation at the onset of the Holocene in the Lake Qinghai region. Lacustrine precipitates have persisted throughout the Holocene with a maximum during the early to mid-Holocene (similar to 10.5-8.0 ka). Since similar to 8.0 ka, the gradual and significant decreases in aragonite and Sr accumulations in tandem with increasing dust deposit and more positive ostracod delta O-18 may be linked to a weakening of Asian summer monsoons during the mid-to-late Holocene. Overall, our records appear to show a high sensitivity of sediment development and geochemistry in Lake Qinghai to the regional hydroclimate changes since the last glacial. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Testing and application of a two-dimensional hydrothermal model for a water supply reservoir: implications of sedimentation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE												Validation of a two-dimensional hydrothermal stratification model for 14 years for Schoharie Reservoir, N.Y., an impoundment that experiences substantial drawdown, is documented. The model is demonstrated to perform well in simulating the various features of the reservoir's thermal stratification regime in each of the years, including the timing and duration of stratification, the dimensions and temperature of the layers, and the periods of internal wave oscillations in stratified layers. The average root mean square error for temperature predictions for the 14 years is 1.30 degrees C. The validated model is applied in a probabilistic manner to investigate the impacts of sedimentation on the temperature of the withdrawn water (T-w) that enters a stream with a salmonid fishery, and features of the stratification regime. The predicted effects of sedimentation include a shift toward higher T-w values, a shortening of the duration of stratification, and decrease in the depth of the epilimnion in fall. The effects on T-w are exacerbated for the reservoir because of localized sedimentation adjoining the intake that increasingly limits access to cooler layers.

Water samples and sediment were collected in different regions (six sampling sites) of the lake between January and December 2019 and tested for OCPs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results revealed that OCP residues throughout the sites varied depending on the anthropogenic activities of the region. OCPs detected in surface waters ranged from 0.01 to 60.80 mu g/L and sediments from 0.06 to 14.21 ng/g dw. Endrin ketone, endrin aldehyde, endosulfan II, endrin, heptachlor epoxy, beta-BHC, gamma-BHC, ppDDD, and ppDDT concentrations exceeded the maximum residue limits indicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) for surface waters. Of the 18 analyzed OCP components, 17 were detected in sediment samples, and it was noted that they reached the highest concentration in summer. The presence of relatively high OCP levels according to WHO regulations in the waters of Iznik Lake, around which agricultural activities have been increasing rapidly in recent years, is a serious concern, and therefore, appropriate actions should be taken into consideration by the regulatory authorities.

The lakes range in A(0) from 4 to 4.9 x 10(5) ha, and midsummer (mid-June through mid-August mean) K-d varied from <0.2 to >2.5 m(-1) with greatest variation in small lakes that were experimentally eutrophicated or acidified or whose terrestrial basins were burned. Over the full spectrum of lake sizes, A(0) was the primary determinant of E(d); transparency significantly modified this relationship but only in small lakes (A(0) <500 ha). In noneutrophic shield lakes, transparency is controlled by the concentration of dissolved organic C (DOG). Lower DOC concentrations (a likely consequence of 2 xCO(2) climate change) would cause transparency to increase, resulting in 1-2-m-deeper epilimnia in small lakes; there would be no similar effect in large lakes.																			0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					912	920		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0912	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0912													WOS:A1996VN45800013

The Great Vasyugan Mire of western Siberia: Hydrochemistry and greenhouse gas dynamics of peatland pools of the world's largest mire	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Siberian peatlands act as the primary regulator for carbon (C) exchange between land and atmosphere; however, the aquatic component of this ecosystem, peatland pools, remains virtually unknown with respect to biogeochemical parameters and C fluxes. Here we report results from a 'snapshot' (end of spring period) study investigating hydrochemical parameters and greenhouse gas (CO2 and CH4) concentrations and emissions from shallow peatland pools of the Great Vasyugan Mire (GVM) in western Siberia. The pools were highly oligotrophic, acidic, humic, iron-rich, poor in chloride and sulfate, and emitted 0.15 g C-CO2 m-2 d-1 as measured by floating chambers. There was significant dependence between the pool area and various hydrochemical parameters across wide range of pool sizes (from 700 to 1,380,000 m2). Concentrations of CO2, CH4, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), some organic nutrients and lithogenic trace elements increased with decreasing pool size, likely reflecting organic matter delivery from peat and shallow subsurface waters. In contrast, with increasing pool size, there was a decrease in DOC aromaticity and an increase in pH and concentration of labile elements (anions, alkaline and alkaline-earth metals). This was consistent with an increase in autochthonous production and degree of connection to groundwater reservoirs. Annual emissions of C from peatland pools and lakes of the GVM are comparable to peat growth rate in the territory and exceed the lateral export of DOC by rivers. Future studies should address the seasonal aspects of C biogeochemistry, including the ice cover period.

The eruption created a large, closed crater that accumulated hydrothermal upwellings, near-surface aquifer and meteoric inflows. A shallow lake formed by early September 1991, and showed a long-term increase in level of ∼1 m/month until an artificial drainage was created in September 2001. Comparison of the temporal trends in lake chemistry to pre- and post-eruptive springs distinguishes processes important in lake evolution. The lake was initially near-neutral pH and dominated by meteoric influx and Cl-SO4 and Cl-HCO3 hydrothermal waters, with peaks in SO4 and Ca concentrations resulting from leaching of anhydrite and aerosol-laden tephra. Magmatic discharge, acidity (pH∼2) and rock dissolution peaked in late 1992, during and immediately after eruption of a lava dome on the crater floor. Since cessation of dome growth, trends in lake pH (increase from 3 to 5.5), temperature (decline from 40 to 26°C), and chemical and isotopic composition indicate that magmatic degassing and rock dissolution have declined significantly relative to the input of meteoric water and immature hydrothermal brine. Higher concentrations of Cl, Na, K, Li and B, and lower concentrations of Mg, Ca, Fe, SO4 and F up to 1999 highlight the importance of a dilute hydrothermal contribution, as do stable-isotope and tritium compositions of the various fluids. However, samples taken since that time indicate further dilution and steeper trends of increasing pH and declining temperature. Present gas and brine compositions from crater fumaroles and hot springs indicate boiling of an immature Cl-SO4 geothermal fluid of near-neutral pH at approximately 200°C, rather than direct discharge from magma. It appears that remnants of the pre-eruptive hydrothermal system invaded the magma conduit shortly after the end of dome emplacement, blocking the direct degassing path. This, along with the large catchment area (∼5 km(2)) and the high precipitation rate of the area, led to a rapid transition from a small and hot acid lake to a large lake with near-ambient temperature and pH. This behavior contrasts with that of peak-activity lakes that have more sustained volcanic gas influx (e.g., Kawah Ijen, Indonesia; Poas and Rincon de la Vieja, Costa Rica).

This work presents for the first time a simple and practically useful model to facilitate the planning and to predict the outcome of potash treatments by simulating the processes that regulate the water chemical response of such a treatment. The model is a mixed model in the sense that it contains both statistical regressions and dynamic interactions within a lake ecosystem. This paper focuses on the dynamic processes and gives both calibrations and extensive validations of the model. A few examples on the practical use of the model are presented. The results indicate that the model, using only easily accessible input data, can, in fact, give good predictions on the increase and duration in potassium concentration following a potash treatment.

Results show that the Freundlich and Langmuir model can describe the sorption behavior of TBBPA well. The calculated Gamma(max) (maximum unit sorption quantity) values were 1.47, 2.13, and 3.65 mg/kg for mineral group (MG), clay group (CG), and humin group (HG) sediments, respectively. HG exhibited a stronger nonlinear behavior than did CG and MG. The order of sorption capability was as follows: HG. CG. MG. Desorption capability order was the opposite. Simultaneously, it was found that precipitation was the main sorption type for TBBPA on sediment. The contribution of precipitation sorption ranged from 45 percent to 70 percent within a TBBPA concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 mg/L in the supernatant. This may be attributable to anomalous changes in the compounds' ionic activity in combination with metal cations. Sorption-desorption experiments on clay sediment were also conducted at pH levels ranging from 3 to 14 and temperatures ranging from 4 degrees C to 30 degrees C. In this regard, the sorption of TBBPA decreased as pH and temperature increased gradually. Further-more, sorption and desorption reached a dynamic equilibrium at pH 11.5 and at a temperature of 30 degrees C, respectively. The release of TBBPA from sediment would be higher in summer than in the three other seasons, which may pose a potential ecological risk for aquatic life in lakes.

The algal colonies were always buoyant (owing to the presence of gas vesicles) during windy periods when the colonies were mixed throughout the epilimnion. Buoyancy resulted in algal accumulations in the surface waters under calm conditions. The blue-green algae then regulated buoyancy in response to light intensity; when algal colonies were exposed to high light intensities some of the gas vesicles collapsed and the algal colonies sank. In calm weather, subsurface population maxima of Aphanizomenon occurred in early afternoon because of gas vesicle collapse. Collapse of the pressure-sensitive gas vesicles was accomplished by an increase in cell turgor pressure, driven by photosynthesis. During periods of mixed blue-green populations, all species were not equally responsive to the effect of light upon buoyancy and the amount of light required to cause a loss of buoyancy was not constant throughout the summer.																			0003-9136						1978	83	4					524	537																WOS:A1978FQ29900006

Therefore, the main objective of this work is to evaluate the spatial distribution of the water quality of Ratuwa river and its tributaries. The water samples were collected from six discrete sampling locations and fifteen parameters were tested using respective well-calibrated equipment and standard APHA methods. The physicochemical analysis, water quality index, and correlation matrix method were employed to evaluate the spatial variation of the water quality of Ratuwa river. Turbidity was the most polluting factor in river water. The results showed the spatial variation of the water quality index (WQI) from 39.3 to 70.5, which fell in the range of "good" to "poor" water quality status. None of the water samples was either "excellent" or "unsuitable for drinking." The water quality was "Poor" upstream and downstream of Ratuwa river due to the high value of turbidity. Chaju river was found to have unpolluted whereas Dipeni river was slightly polluted due to domestic and municipal wastes. Hence, the deterioration of water quality can be attributed to natural and anthropogenic sources.					; rai, manisha/AAG-6762-2019	Shrestha, Arun Kumar/0000-0002-5529-6924; 													1932-6203					MAY 2	2023	18	5							e0285164	10.1371/journal.pone.0285164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285164								37130138					WOS:000984886700027

Habitat selection by nesting Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) along Great Salt Lake, Utah	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Eared Grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) are colonial-nesting waterbirds that use waterbodies along Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah, during the breeding season. We examined the habitat characteristics of nesting colonies established by Eared Grebes, including water depth, invertebrate biomass density, vegetation species, vegetation cover, waterbody area, distance to shore, distance to nearest emergent vegetation, and distance to GSL. Samples and measurements were taken during the summer of 2018 from inside Eared Grebe nesting colonies, outside colonies but within the same waterbody, and unused waterbodies that did not contain colonies. We compared colonies sites to non-colonies sites that were within the same waterbody using logistic regression to build models and found no differences between them, suggesting that space for a colony is not lacking within a colony waterbody. Colony waterbodies differed from unused waterbodies (those not containing a colony) in having deeper water and higher percent cover of submerged aquatic vegetation. Results from Eared Grebe colonies around GSL were compared to colonies found in a literature review. Water depth in colonies around GSL were shallower than colonies located elsewhere. All of the colonies in this study were established on mats of submerged aquatic vegetation as opposed to colonies in other studies that were built on emergent vegetation. Wildlife biologists around GSL can manage for nesting Eared Grebes by maintaining a water depth (35-55 cm) that is conducive for submerged aquatic vegetation growth and high invertebrate densities. Climate change models predict that the American Southwest, which is already arid, will become drier in the future. When combined with increasing diversions of water for human uses, the waterbodies where Eared Grebes currently locate their colonies may become entirely dry or too shallow in the future to sustain them.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				JUN	2020	132	2					388	397		10.1676/1559-4491-132.2.388	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/1559-4491-132.2.388													WOS:000617763600014

Inundated wetland dynamics over boreal regions from remote sensing: the use of Topex-Poseidon dual-frequency radar altimeter observations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												This study presents a first attempt to estimate the extent and seasonality of northern wetlands using radar altimeter satellite observations. The sensitivity of the Topex- Poseidon dual- frequency radar altimeter to detect inundation is investigated and compared with passive and active microwave satellite measurements along with a land surface climatology database. The C band backscatter altimeter signal clearly tracks passive microwave emissivity observations of wetlands and is able to detect small flooded areas. Because of the nadir incidence angle, the radar altimeter also shows more capability to detect wetlands than the C band scatterometer. Monthly flooded areas are calculated by estimating flooded pixel fractional coverage using the altimeter C band backscatter magnitude and a linear mixing model with dual- frequency altimeter backscatter difference, C- Ku, to account for vegetation effects. Because of the Topex- Poseidon satellite spatial coverage, the results are given only from 40 degrees N to 66 degrees N. This region nevertheless represents more than 30% of world's inundated surfaces during the summer. A direct validation of the inundated extent is unfortunately impossible on a large scale, due to the scarcity of quantitative observations. As a consequence, the results are evaluated by comparison with other existing estimates. Radar altimetry estimates, comprising natural wetlands and river/lakes, indicate a maximum inundated area of 1.86x10(6) km(2) for July 1993 and 1994 as compared with 1.31x10(6) km(2) from passive microwave technique and similar to 2.10x10(6) km(2) from climatology dataset. The wetland seasonal variability derived from the altimeter and passive microwave techniques agrees well. These promising results could soon be applied to the ENVISAT dual-frequency radar altimeter that will provide a better survey of global inundated surfaces thanks to its much more complete spatial coverage.

Females use mainly saturated fatty acids (SFA) for energy purposes, while males use monounsaturates (MUFA) also. During vitellogenesis, females can also mobilize fatty acid precursors of gonadal highly unsaturated fatty acids of the omega 3 family from muscle tissue, bur in both sexes specific retention of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA=22:6 omega 3) in muscle is evident. Landlocked shad, unlike several freshwater fishes, can utilize the liver as well as body cavity and muscle as a fat reserve depot. The perivisceral fat stored during the feeding period appears to be utilized mainly for winter energy maintenance requirements. Lipid reserves from liver and muscle are also mobilized to meet the requirements resulting from gonadal development. In particular, females seem to use liver reserves, especially 18:1 omega 9, more than males, to meet the demands of ovogenesis. In the muscle, SFA are used mainly for energy purposes. During gonadal development, specific muscular and hepatic omega 3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (omega 3 HUFA=20 : 5+22 : 5+22 : 6) and omega 6 HUFA (20 : 4+22 :4+22 : 5) retention is evident in both sexes, while fatty acid precursors of omega 3 and omega 6 HUFA are mobilized, especially from muscle tissue.

Therefore, a global assessment based on the comparison of existing datasets is not possible. For this study, 79 water samples from a monitoring of five lakes in Wallonia and occasional blooms in Flanders and Brussels, including a canal, were analyzed. A Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method allowed to detect and quantify eight microcystin congeners. The mcyE gene was detected using PCR, while dominant cyanobacterial species were identified using 16S RNA amplification and direct sequencing. The cyanobacterial diversity for two water samples was characterized with amplicon sequencing. Microcystins were detected above limit of quantification (LOQ) in 68 water samples, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended guideline value for microcystins in recreational water (24 mu g L-1) was surpassed in 18 samples. The microcystin concentrations ranged from 0.11 mu g L-1 to 2798.81 mu g L-1 total microcystin. For 45 samples, the dominance of the genera Microcystis sp., Dolichospermum sp., Aphanizomenon sp., Cyanobium/Synechococcus sp., Planktothrix sp., Romeria sp., Cyanodictyon sp., and Phormidium sp. was shown. Moreover, the mcyE gene was detected in 75.71% of all the water samples.					; Van Hassel, Wannes/HQZ-6444-2023; Wilmotte, Annick/H-1686-2011	Wilmotte, Annick/0000-0003-3546-3489; Durieu, Benoit/0000-0003-4801-7277; Andjelkovic, Mirjana/0000-0002-3504-7066; Van Hassel, Wannes/0000-0003-0183-3891; 														2072-6651				JAN	2022	14	1							61	10.3390/toxins14010061	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins14010061								35051038					WOS:000747504600001

Liquefaction of a soft cohesive mud bed due to wave-induced pressure loading is considered to occur when the effective submerged weight of the particle or floc is exceeded by the upward inertial force due to bed oscillation. Bed dynamics, characterized by a uniaxial extensional-Voigt viscoelastic solid response, is modeled as a spring-dashpot-mass analog for obtaining fluid mud layer thickness at equilibrium under sustained wave motion. Model results are compared with data obtained in wave flumes using weakly cohesive muds. Order of magnitude agreement between theory and data suggests that shear rheometry can be used to determine the appropriate constitutive relationship required to calculate fluid mud thickness. It is shown that the model provides reasonable estimates of fluid mud thickness in Lake Okeechobee in south-central Florida. A noteworthy feature of the method is that mud properties are described by easily measurable parameters including density and rheological constants, without the need to specify mud composition.																					0-444-50463-X				2000	3						79	93																WOS:000173565800006

Small ponds with major impact: The relevance of ponds and lakes in permafrost landscapes to carbon dioxide emissions	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Although ponds make up roughly half of the total area of surface water in permafrost landscapes, their relevance to carbon dioxide emissions on a landscape scale has, to date, remained largely unknown. We have therefore investigated the inflows and outflows of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon from lakes, ponds, and outlets on Samoylov Island, in the Lena Delta of northeastern Siberia in September 2008, together with their carbon dioxide emissions. Outgassing of carbon dioxide (CO2) from these ponds and lakes, which cover 25% of Samoylov Island, was found to account for between 74 and 81% of the calculated net landscape-scale CO2 emissions of 0.2-1.1 g C m(-2) d(-1) during September 2008, of which 28-43% was from ponds and 27-46% from lakes. The lateral export of dissolved carbon was negligible compared to the gaseous emissions due to the small volumes of runoff. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon in the ponds were found to triple during freezeback, highlighting their importance for temporary carbon storage between the time of carbon production and its emission as CO2. If ponds are ignored the total summer emissions of CO2-C from water bodies of the islands within the entire Lena Delta (0.7-1.3 Tg) are underestimated by between 35 and 62%.					; Boike, Julia/R-4766-2016; Langer, Moritz/KWU-0937-2024; Boike, Julia/JZT-8129-2024	Langer, Moritz/0000-0002-2704-3655; Boike, Julia/0000-0002-5875-2112; 													0886-6236	1944-9224				JUN 26	2012	26								GB2041	10.1029/2011GB004237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011GB004237													WOS:000305991400001

Investigations into how to remove algal organic matter (AOM) are thus of great importance from an environmental point of view because most lakes and reservoirs in South Korea suffer from algae problems, especially in the summer. Many efforts have been made to remove AOM from the aquatic environment in South Korea. In this study, we focus on development of a new AOM removal system, utilizing waste oyster shells and ferrihydrite as the media of the filtration system. Using this system, the removal rate of AOM was investigated regarding the concentrations of chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and alginate. It was found that about 92% of the total phosphorus was removed through this system when raw oyster shell powders were heated at 900 degrees C to convert them into calcium oxide powders. The use of a continuous system also led to a reduction of 94.2% in total phosphorus, 78.8% in chlorophyll a, and 43.6% in alginate.																			1178-6221					MAR	2020	13								1178622119898422	10.1177/1178622119898422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1178622119898422													WOS:000524435400001
J	Watson, SB; McCauley, E; Downing, JA				Watson, SB; McCauley, E; Downing, JA			Patterns in phytoplankton taxonomic composition across temperate lakes of differing nutrient status	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We describe the relationships between summer average total phosphorus (TP) and the biomass of six major phytoplankton taxonomic groups from 91 north temperate lakes. Both regression and a locally weighted smoothing (LOWESS) analyses show that all groups increase with TP but over different nutrient ranges. At nutrient extremes, i.e. very low and high levels of TP, the few taxonomic groups that dominate total biomass are generally dissimilar. In oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes, most group biomass curves show corresponding increases or decreases, but different rates of change. The curves converge at intermediate TP levels (similar to 10-30 mu g liter(-1)) where there is increased equitability among algal groups. In highly eutrophic lakes, the slope of the total biomass curve decreases, as do all the relative abundances of all groups except blue-greens and diatoms. We conclude that the curvilinearity of the TP-total biomass curve is not attributable to a single taxonomic group, because ail groups show some nonlinearity in relation to TP. We suggest that morphological diversity, differential herbivory, and, in particular, mixing regime may explain some of the observed patterns.

With a view to the last c. 20 years and the future, a regional 'syndrome of water shortage' has been frequently stated, which impairs particularly peatlands, flowing waters and lakes. Accordingly, the overall question addressed in this study is: What can regional and local gauging records tell us about decadal hydrological changes of lakes and their catchments? In the study area, most of the gauging records of lakes begin only in the late 1990s. Forty-five lake-level records were analysed by hierarchical agglomerative clustering, looking for the trend in the 1999-2008 time window. The analyses show that lake levels had varying dynamics, namely a negative, unclear or even a positive trend. The proportional shares of these three groups are 23 (51 %) to 15 (34 %) to 7 lakes (15 %), respectively. In group 1, largely groundwater-fed lakes, lake-level changes depend on groundwater-level changes. These are controlled by decreasing groundwater recharge in the catchments, which are caused by specific seasonal weather conditions in the observation period, and the impact of the dominating pine forests, which consume high quantities of water. In group 2, mainly stream lakes, direct human impact drives the lake levels through the management of weirs and ground sills. Nearly all lakes in group 3, consisting of river, stream and spring lakes, were subject to impoundment measures initiated by local rewetting projects. Thus, an important finding with respect to the impact of climate and land use is the fact that the ('natural') lakes of the region, primarily fed by groundwater and precipitation, show a predominantly negative lake-level trend in the period studied. Beyond the 10-year-time window analysed, further regional data show that periodic lake-level fluctuations with amplitudes of c. 1-2(-3) m are characteristic for regional groundwater-fed lakes.

Optimizing withdrawal from drinking water reservoirs to reduce downstream temperature pollution and reservoir hypoxia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Sustainable management of drinking water reservoirs requires balancing the demands of water supply whilst minimizing environmental impact. This study numerically simulates the effect of an improved withdrawal scheme designed to alleviate the temperature pollution downstream of a reservoir. The aim was to identify an optimal withdrawal strategy such that water of a desirable discharge temperature can be supplied downstream without leading to unacceptably low oxygen concentrations within the reservoir. First, we calibrated a one-dimensional numerical model for hydrodynamics and Oxygen dynamics (GLM-AED2), verifying that the model reproduced water temperatures and hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations accurately over a 5 year period. Second, the model was extended to include an adaptive withdrawal functionality, allowing for a prescribed withdrawal temperature to be found, with the potential constraint of hypolimnetic oxygen concentration. Scenario simulations on epi-/metal-imnetic withdrawal demonstrate that the model is able to autonomously determine the best withdrawal height depending on the thermal structure and the hypolimnetic oxygen concentration thereby optimizing the ability to supply a desirable discharge temperature to the downstream river during summer. This new withdrawal strategy also increased the hypolimnetic raw water volume to be used for drinking water supply, but reduced the dissolved oxygen concentrations in the deep and cold water layers (hypolimnion). Implications of the results for reservoir management are discussed and the numerical model is provided for operators as a simple and efficient tool for optimizing the withdrawal strategy within different reservoir contexts.

The MP concentrations ranged from 503 to 3154 MP/kg, with a notable seasonal variation. The highest concentrations of microplastics occurred in the Spring, ranging from 467 to 3445 MP/kg. Microplastics were identified using optical microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Polymer analysis revealed that the Gagribal basin was contaminated with polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyamide (PA), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In contrast, the Nigeen basin mainly comprises PE, PP, and PS. The significantly elevated Polymer Hazard Index (PHI) values, exceeding 1000 in the Gagribal basin, were attributed to the presence of PVC. Sediment quality was assessed using Pollution Load Index (PLI), Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI), and PHI. Health risk metrics, such as estimated daily intake (EDI) and microplastic carcinogenic risks (MPCR), were also evaluated. There is a positive correlation between microplastic abundance and total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN). The Nigeen basin, characterized by a higher proportion of less hazardous polymers like PP, exhibited greater TOC levels due to enhanced microbial degradation of microplastics. Conversely, the Gagribal basin, with its higher presence of toxic polymers like PVC, had lower TOC levels, likely due to these compounds' inhibition of microbial activity. This study provides crucial insight into the spatial distribution and ecological impact of MPs in Dal Lake, setting the stage for future research on their effects on aquatic ecosystems.

Boat induced sediment resuspension and water clarity in shallow flows	RIVER FLOW 2020					10th River Flow Conference on Fluvial Hydraulics	JUL 07-10, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Delft Univ Technol, United Nat Educ, Sci & Cultural Org, Inst Water Educ, Deltares, Rijkswaterstaat, Minist Infrastructure & Water Management				Water clarity in rivers, lakes, and estuaries is of major concern in different parts of the world; it is of continuous research interest due to its high complexity and adverse implications. Herein we take the case of the shallow area of Lake Tahoe as a surrogate of what happens in other shallow flows. Water clarity at Lake Tahoe has been declining during the last decades, compromising the 'blueness' condition for which the lake is worldwide known. To explain such decline, some researchers pointed to high boating activity as the source of particles that increase turbidity levels. In this work, we address the issue via numerical simulations and fieldwork. Vessels at different velocities were numerically modeled using a Detached Eddy Simulation. In addition, during summer 2019, a transect of turbidity and temperature-depth sensors were deployed on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe at depths not greater than 3 meters. Preliminary results lead us to consider boat induced sediment resuspension as plausible but not a dominant factor for the lake's overall water clarity decline.

Observational results reveal a well-marked frontal region in the vicinity of the river mouth, causing the plume to discharge into the lake in the surface layers (positive buoyant). Wind driven alongshore currents at the mid-depth had speeds of 2-9 cm/s, in comparison to those in the cross-shore 3-6 cm/s, which transported the plume along the shore during the measurement period. Series of laboratory experiments were conducted to obtain the propagation speed (U) of the buoyant plume in terms of buoyancy anomaly (Ba), Richardson number (Ri), dimensionless time (t'), and aspect ratio (A). Based on our experiments, we developed two non -dimensional relationships describing the speed of propagation (U) as UlBa(1/2) = 8 Ri(-1/2)t'(1/3)A and the plume thickness (h) as h/H= 0.8 Ri(-1/4),t'(1/2)A in the water depth (H), which are in agreement with field observations.

J	BRUNETON, P				BRUNETON, P			GEOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE CIGAR LAKE URANIUM DEPOSIT	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Cigar Lake uranium deposit occurs within the Athabasca Basin of northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Like other major uranium deposits of the basin, it is located at the unconformity separating Helikian sandstones of the Athabasca Group from Aphebian metasediments and plutonic rocks of the Wollaston Group. The Athabasca Group was deposited in an intracontinental sedimentary basin that was filled by fluviatile terrestrial quartz sandstones and conglomerates. The group appears undeformed and its actual maximum thickness is about 1500 m. On the eastern side of the basin, the detrital units correspond to the Manitou Falls Formations where most of the uranium deposits are located. The Lower Pelitic unit of the Wollaston Group, which lies directly on the Archean basement, is considered to be the most favourable horizon for uranium mineralization. During the Hudsonian orogeny (1800-1900 Ma), the group underwent polyphase deformation and upper amphibolite facies metamorphism. The Hudsonian orogeny was followed by a long period of erosion and weathering and the development of a paleoweathering profile. On the Waterbury Lake property, the Manitou Falls Formation is 250-500 m thick and corresponds to units MFd, MFc, and MFb. The conglomeratic MFb unit hosts the Cigar Lake deposit. However, the basal conglomerate is absent at the deposit, wedging out against an east - west, 20 m high, pre-Athabasca basement ridge, on top of which is located the orebody. Two major lithostructural domains are present in the metamorphic basement of the property: (1) a southern area composed mainly of pelitic metasediments (Wollaston Domain) and (2) a northern area with large lensoid granitic domes (Mudjatik Domain). The Cigar Lake east-west pelitic basin, which contains the deposit, is located in the transitional zone between the two domains. The metamorphic basement rocks in the basin consist mainly of graphitic metapelitic gneisses and calcsilicate gneisses, which are inferred to be part of the Lower Pelitic unit. Graphite- and pyrite-rich ''augen gneisses,'' an unusual facies within the graphitic metapelitic gneisses, occur primarily below the Cigar Lake orebody. The mineralogy and geochemistry of the graphitic metapelitic gneisses suggest that they were originally shales. The abundance of magnesium in the intercalated carbonates layers indicates an evaporitic origin. The structural framework is dominated by large northeast - southwest lineaments and wide east - west mylonitic corridors. These mylonites, which contain the augen gneisses, are considered to be the most favourable features for the concentration of uranium mineralization. Despite the presence of the orebody, large areas of the Waterbury Lake property remain totally unexplored and open for new discoveries.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				APR	1993	30	4					653	673		10.1139/e93-054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e93-054													WOS:A1993MA99800002
J	Zhou, XF; Zhang, S; Zhu, D				Zhou, Xuefan; Zhang, Shuai; Zhu, Dun			Impact of Urban Water Networks on Microclimate and PM2.5 Distribution in Downtown Areas: A Case Study of Wuhan	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT												Rapid urbanization in China has resulted in highly dense urban forms and marked reductions in ecological resources, which in turn have caused severe urban heat islands and PM2.5 pollution. In typical cities with a water network, such as Wuhan, the use of water resources to improve the urban climate environment has become an urgent issue. In this study, we explored the impact of water networks on the microclimate and PM2.5 distribution in Wuhan by using multi-source remote sensing data and the weather research and forecasting model. Our results indicated that the water network has a blocking effect on PM2.5. Taking pollutant sources into consideration, the coverage of the water surface is positively correlated with a PM2.5 concentration of 0.606-0.703; the concentration of PM2.5 over suburban lakes with an area larger than 60 km2 is approximately 6%-13% higher than that of the surrounding land surface. We also found that the water network reduced the average temperature of the downtown and the urban hinterland at noon by 1 K and 0.5 K, respectively, and increased the height of boundary layer at night by more than 60 m-an approximately one-third increase-which helped decrease the level of PM2.5. In addition, the impact of water bodies located in different "ring loops" on the downtown microclimate varied significantly. Water bodies located downtown significantly increased the night wind speed in downtown areas to as much as 2 m/s, while those in nearby and outer suburbs increased the wind speed downtown by more than 1 m/s at noon.

The prokaryotic structure and bacterial diversity in sediment samples collected during the 2008-2009 austral summer from five inland lakes, two coastal lakes, and an estuarine site were analyzed by Catalyzed Reporter Deposition Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) and 16S rRNA 454 tag pyrosequencing techniques, respectively. Differently from inland lakes, which range around the oligotrophic status, coastal lakes are eutrophic environments, enriched by nutrient inputs from marine animals. Although the prokaryotic abundances (estimated as DAPI stained cells) in sediment samples were quite similar among inland and coastal lakes, Bacteria always far dominated over Archaea. Despite the phylogenetic analysis indicated that most of sequences were affiliated to a few taxonomic groups, mainly referred to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, their relative abundances greatly differed from each site. Differences in bacterial composition showed that lacustrine sediments were more phyla rich than the estuarine sediment. Proteobacterial classes in lacustrine samples were dominated by Betaproteobacteria (followed by Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria), while in the estuarine sample, they were mainly related to Gammaproteobacteria (followed by Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria). Higher number of sequences of Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes were observed in sediments of inland lakes compared to those of coastal lakes, whereas Chloroflexi were relatively more abundant in the sediments of coastal eutrophic lakes. As demonstrated by the great number of dominant bacterial genera, bacterial diversity was higher in the sediments of inland lakes than that in coastal lakes. Ilumatobacter (Actinobacteria), Gp16 (Acidobacteria), and Gemmatimonas (Gemmatimonadetes) were recovered as dominant genera in both inland and coastal lakes, but not in the estuarine sample, indicating that they may be useful markers of Antarctic lakes. The proximity to the sea, the different lake depths and the external or internal origin of the nutrient sources shape the bacterial communities composition in lacustrine sediments of Byers Peninsula.

Late Holocene climatic changes in Garhwal Himalaya	CURRENT SCIENCE												Geochemical study of a 3.55 m long lake sediment core from the Badanital Lake (Garhwal Himalaya) reveals Late Holocene centennial-scale climatic changes. The ecosystem of the tectonically formed lake seems to be controlled by natural and anthropogenic factors. The imprints of four major global events, e.g. 4.2 ka event, Medieval Warm Period (MWP), Little Ice Age (LIA) and modern warming are observed. By using the geochemical parameters, e.g. major oxides and their ratios (CaO/MgO, CaO/TiO2, MgO/TiO2, Na2O/TiO2, TiO2/Al2O3, Na2O/K2O and Fe2O3/TiO2), major elements, chemical index of weathering, chemical index of alteration and loss on ignition, the core profile is divided into six major climatic zones. The sediment accumulation rate was extremely slow during a cold/dry phase from ca. 5.1 to 3.5 ka BP. This was followed by wetter/moist phase from ca. 3.5 to 1.8 ka BP and the area further remained under arid conditions from ca. 1800 to 920 years BP. Almost wet/moist environment prevailed around 920-440 years BP, corresponding to the MWP. The LIA (440-160 years BP) was somewhat cooler, whereas post LIA, particularly from 160 years BP points to modern warming.																			0011-3891					APR 10	2013	104	7					911	919																WOS:000318128900022

Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a potent cytotoxic cyanobacterial metabolite involved in triggering illness in humans. The occurrence of CYN has been mostly associated with tropical and subtropical cyanobacteria. We analyzed CYN concentration and phytoplankton assemblages of three lakes located in western Poland during the summers of 2006 and 2007. CYN was detected in 46% of our samples using the HPLC and LC-MS/MS methods. CYN concentrations were in the range of 0.16-1.8 mu g L-similar to 1 and exceeded the drinking water guideline value of 1 mu g L-1 in two samples. This is the first report of CYN occurrence in this part of Europe and provides further evidence that this toxin is common not only in subtropical and tropical regions. The lakes were dominated by Planktothrix agardhii but the occurrence of the CYN investigated here might be associated with the invasive species Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and/or native Aphanizomenon gracile.

J	Scheuhammer, AM; Atchison, CM; Wong, AHK; Evers, DC				Scheuhammer, AM; Atchison, CM; Wong, AHK; Evers, DC			Mercury exposure in breeding common loons (Gavia immer) in central Ontario, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY					Wildlife Mercury Conference	APR 12-13, 1996	FAIRFAX, VA					Total Hg concentrations were determined in blood and feather samples of breeding common loons (Gavia immer) and their chicks from 24 lakes in Ontario with a range of water chemistry and fish Hg concentrations. In paired comparisons, males had significantly higher blood (p < 0.005) and feather (p < 0.05) Hg concentrations than their female mates. Sex differences in Hg concentrations were attributable to size differences between the two sexes and to the possible transfer of Hg to eggs by females during egg-laying. Significantly higher blood (p < 0.001) and feather (p < 0.01) Hg concentrations were found in adult loons compared to their chicks. Adult blood Hg concentrations were significantly correlated with those of their chicks (r = 0.62, p < 0.05). Adult blood concentrations averaged about 13 times those of corresponding chicks. Both adult and chick blood Hg concentrations were positively correlated with fish Hg concentrations (r = 0.71 and 0.51, respectively), indicating that adult loons in central Ontario, like their chicks, probably feed mainly on their breeding lakes and reflect the fish Hg concentrations of those lakes. Three of 24 lakes had 20- to 50-g fish (mainly perch and sunfish) with Hg concentrations at or exceeding the critical concentration (0.3-0.4 mu g/g wet weight or similar to 1-2 mu g/g dry weight) reported to cause reproductive impairment in loons. Monitoring Hg in blood (adult and chick) and feathers (chicks only) is useful for assessing the local bioavailability of methylmercury and the degree of current dietary Hg exposure in loons and other piscivorous birds.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				FEB	1998	17	2					191	196		10.1002/etc.5620170208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620170208													WOS:000071690700008

The recently built upstream Xiluodu, Wudongde, Xiangjiaba and Beihtan dams have altered the ecohydrology of mainstream and tributaries, so nutrients regime during pre and post dam stages are comparatively investigated here. Although total phosphorus (TP) increased at the lower reach, eutrophication remained TP limited with few exceptions. Maximum supply from main stream, potential of water exchange on surface corresponding to increased overflow intrusion facilitated increased average total nitrogen (TN) at euphotic zone in XXB by 0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/L respectively since 2014. Eutrophication and algal growth in XXB remained TP limited with few exceptions at the upper reach. Average TN increased by 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mg/L at the upper, middle and lower reaches respectively in Late March since 2014 compared to those in early years. It increased by 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg/L at the upper, middle and lower reaches in Early April since 2014. It increased by 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mg/L at the upper, middle and lower reaches in mid April since 2014. It increased slightly at the upper reach, 0.6 mg/L at the middle reach and 0.9 mg/L at the lower reach during late April. It increased slightly at the upper reach and by 0.3 mg/L at the middle reach and by 0.5 mg/L at the lower reaches corresponding to either of the patterns. During mid May, it remained the same at the upper reach, decreased by 0.2 mg/L at the middle reach and 0.5 mg/L at the lower reach. During late May, it remained the same at the upper reach, decreased by 0.4 mg/L at the middle reach and 0.6 mg/L at the lower reaches. These statistics indicate average an increase in TN in spring except in late May .TN concentration was beyond danger limit sustaining and prolonging eutrophication status in spring. As overflow, interflow and upper interflow patterns are prevalent in random order so nutrients could not be predicted theoretically, however nutrients management from non-point sources and the main supplier Three Gorges Reservoir is advisable.

Additionally, global pollution due to various newly introduced pollutants like pesticides is on use since the past century and many factors contribute to contamination even in Antarctica. During thirty fourth Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (ISEA) in austral summer of 2014-2015, fifteen lake water samples were collected from five different lakes at Broknes peninsula, Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) residue levels found in lake water samples varied from 10.33-70.00pg/mL in five different lakes. Presence of p,p'-DDT was detected in all different lakes but high concentration found in P4 lake water. After study confirms that Broknes peninsula in the Larsemann Hills area, East Antarctica has a trace amount of POPs which is an alarming situation and needs to be investigated further to maintain the pristine environment in Antarctica. The presence of POPs may be attributed to orographic effects, migratory birds, biomagnification and anthropogenic sources. In the future, new emerging pollutants must be analyzed like microplastics, phthalate, Paraxanthene etc.					Bhardwaj, Dr. Laxmi/ABH-3230-2021; Ranjan, Anuj/I-9768-2018; Bhardwaj, Dr. Laxmi Kant/ABH-3230-2021; Sharma, Sandeep/N-5311-2014	Ranjan, Anuj/0000-0003-2592-9716; Bhardwaj, Dr. Laxmi Kant/0000-0001-7518-4199; 													0963-9292	1573-3017				JUL	2019	28	5					589	596		10.1007/s10646-019-02045-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-019-02045-x								31044329					WOS:000471920500011

This has largely been attributed to the occurrence of a variety of known and "unknown", emerging novel diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated that colonies often can harbour more than one pathogen, making identification of etiological agents with classical methods difficult. By employing an unbiased metagenomic approach, which allows the detection of both unexpected and previously unknown infectious agents, the detection of three viruses, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus (ALPV), Israel Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), and Lake Sinai Virus (LSV), in honeybees from Spain is reported in this article. The existence of a subgroup of ALPV with the ability to infect bees was only recently reported and this is the first identification of such a strain in Europe. Similarly, LSV appear to be a still unclassified group of viruses with unclear impact on colony health and these viruses have not previously been identified outside of the United States. Furthermore, our study also reveals that these bees carried a plant virus, Turnip Ringspot Virus (TuRSV), potentially serving as important vector organisms. Taken together, these results demonstrate the new possibilities opened up by high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis to study emerging new diseases in domestic and wild animal populations, including honeybees.

It is shown that vast differences in nutrient content of the reservoir's tributaries cause its trophic state to change significantly in mouth areas of some larger inflowing rivers. However, in the largest part of the lake the relationship between nutrient content and chlorophyll becomes more subtle, whereas zooplankton community structure steps up as an important factor controlling the phytoplankton growth. It is clear that major efforts in nutrient loading reduction are needed to improve the ecological state of the reservoir, and nitrogen control may be more effective, than phosphorus control. However, described trophic interactions may reduce efficiency of nutrient control and require some biomanipulation measures to improve water quality of the reservoir.

Otolith-based ages of Nile tilapia (41.3 - 400.0 mm TL, 1.34 - 1,293 g WW, n = 259) collected from a power plant cooling reservoir and the Pascagoula River proper indicated that feral populations overwintered reaching ages up to 4+ years old in coastal Mississippi, USA; these data confirm their establishment. A survey of mean daily winter (December - February) water temperatures from 2004 - 2010 in this region showed minimum lethal temperatures of < 10 degrees C to occur nearly 11% of the time attesting to the adaptability of the Nile tilapia as an invasive species. One annulus (opaque zone) per year was being deposited from April to August based on marginal increment analysis along with sulcal groove length-age estimation of the young-of-the-year Nile tilapia. Additionally, life history metrics measured for this temperate population of Nile tilapia were nearly identical to those reported from African environments, indicating they are flourishing in this non-native habitat.

J	Sjöling, S; Cowan, DA				Sjöling, S; Cowan, DA			Detecting human bacterial contamination in Antarctic soils	POLAR BIOLOGY												The presence of non-indigenous microbial contaminants resulting from human faecal contamination of old and currently occupied base and field camp sites in South Victoria Land, Antarctica, was assessed by PCR amplification of extracted soil DNA using species-specific PCR primers. Positive controls (samples recovered from the environs of Scott Base, including the sewage outfall) gave strong signals with Escherichia coli primers whereas Clostridium clostridiiforme primers yielded a signal only with the sewage outfall sample. A comparison was made of PCR amplification results from samples from the abandoned Canada Glacier camp site, the Lake Fryxell summer camp site, the Cape Bird Adelie penguin colony and pristine sites from relatively inaccessible regions of the Taylor Valley. Results indicated a possible residual level of E. coli contamination in the abandoned Canada Glacier camp site, but no significant contamination of the currently occupied Lake Fryxell camp site. These data may provide indirect evidence for improved awareness and standards of waste handling and disposal over the past two decades of Dry Valley field research.

Deglaciation began before 10,080 +/- 270 BP. The marine fauna in several marine terraces found in the area shows that early-middle Holocene climatic conditions were basically the same as at present. Species found are characteristic of cold and shallow waters, although minor temperature fluctuations cannot be ruled out for this period. A recent radiocarbon date of 7518 +/- 58 BP on Chlamys patagonica (NZ # 7730) confirms that Lago Roca was transformed into a fjord ca. 7500-8000 BP. The sea reached its maximum level of 8-10 m a.s.l. around 6000 BP and at 4000-4500 BP was at least above 6 +/- 1 m a.s.l. Later, when sea level fell, Lago Roca was occupied by fresh water and was no longer tidal. The relative land-sea positions during this period are a consequence of combined eustatic and neotectonic processes.

In the current context of climate change, determining which factors better constrain their variation within lake districts become of paramount importance for understanding species distribution and their conservation. In this study, we describe the regional and short-term interannual variability in surface water temperature of high mountain lakes and ponds of the Pyrenees. And, we use mixed regression models to identify key environmental factors and to infer mean and maximum summer temperature, accumulated degree-days, diel temperature ranges and three-days' oscillation. The study is based on 59 lake-temperature series measured from 2001 to 2014. We found that altitude was the primary explicative factor for accumulated degree-days and mean and maximum temperature. In contrast, lake area showed the most relevant effect on the diel temperature range and temperature oscillations, although diel temperature range was also found to decline with altitude. Furthermore, the morphology of the catchment significantly affected accumulated degree-days and maximum and mean water temperatures. The statistical models developed here were applied to upscale spatially the current thermic conditions across the whole set of lakes and ponds of the Pyrenees.					; Piera, Jaume/I-1152-2015; Camarero, Lluís/J-9239-2012; Miro, Alexandre/K-5758-2017; Buchaca, Teresa/L-1679-2014; Miró, Alexandre/K-5758-2017; Ventura, Marc/A-5660-2008; Catalan, Jordi/A-5420-2008	Sabas, Ibor/0000-0002-4173-5332; Piera, Jaume/0000-0001-5818-9836; Miro, Alexandre/0000-0002-7348-1736; Buchaca, Teresa/0000-0001-7933-8992; Ventura, Marc/0000-0003-1401-414X													1932-6203					AUG 3	2021	16	8							e0254702	10.1371/journal.pone.0254702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254702								34343195					WOS:000685264200038

First field-based atmospheric observation of the reduction of reactive mercury driven by sunlight	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Hourly speciated measurements of atmospheric mercury made in a remote, high-altitude site in the Tibetan Plateau revealed the first field observations of the reduction of reactive mercury in the presence of sunlight in the atmosphere. Measurements were collected over four winter months on the shore of Nam Co Lake in the inland Tibetan Plateau. The data was analyzed to identify sources and atmospheric transformations of the speciated mercury compounds. The absence of local anthropogenic sources provided a unique opportunity to examine chemical transformations of mercury. An optimization algorithm was used to determine the parameters of a chemical box model that would match the measured reactive mercury concentrations. This required the presence of a photolytic reduction reaction previously observed in laboratory studies and in power plant plumes. In addition, the model estimated the role of vertical mixing in diluting reactive gaseous mercury during the day, and the role of bromine chemistry in oxidizing gaseous elemental mercury to produce reactive gaseous mercury. This work provides further evidence of the need to add the photolytic reduction reaction of oxidized mercury into atmospheric transport models in order to better simulate mercury deposition.

We investigated the role of an inducible defense as a factor that influences the trophic pathway in an aquatic food web. Quantitative information on food web structure in Lake Suwa (a eutrophic lake in Japan) was provided by carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses using samples taken during summer and a structural equation model applied to annual monitoring data. As predicted, there was none or only a weak link detected between the prey with induced defenses (Bosmina fatalis) and its invertebrate predator (Leptodora kindtii). The effects of an inducible defense on the trophic links are based mainly on the mortality or population growth rate of organisms using predation, population (or community) level experiments, field data, and model estimates. However, there was no research linking these different data using stable isotope analyses. Our research provides new evidence supporting previous studies by suggesting the importance of the inducible defense in determining food web structure and function.						chang, Kwang-Hyeon/0000-0002-7952-4047													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2015	743	1					15	25		10.1007/s10750-014-1999-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1999-x													WOS:000345036000002
J	Dubinin, YA				Dubinin, Yu A.			The Asia-Pacific on the Eve and during World War II. Soviet Policy and Diplomacy in the Region	MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS												This article offers an in-depth analysis of Soviet policy and diplomacy in the Far East during the tumultuous period spanning from the 1920s to the 1940s. These policies were profoundly shaped by two key factors: firstly, the ideological considerations rooted in the political framework established in the USSR following the 1917 revolution, and secondly, the geopolitical dynamics reflecting the evolving global and regional political landscape in the Far East. The ruling Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government faced formidable challenges as they sought to safeguard the nascent Soviet Republic amid mounting international ten-sions, both on a global scale and within the Asia-Pacific region This study aspires to present a comprehensive and integrated examination of Soviet policy and diplomacy during this era. It delineates four distinct chronological segments, each char-acterized by its unique features, priorities, and challenges. At the same time, these segments are united by the overarching goal of consolidating the Soviet Union's position in the Far Eastern region and the broader Pacific theater. The four discernible stages in Soviet policy and diplomacy in the Far East encompass: 1. The period spanning from 1927 to 1932, marked by an initial deterioration in relations be-tween the Soviet government and the Kuomintang administration following the 1927 split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China (CPC). This phase also witnessed the 1929 conflict on the Chinese Eastern Railway and culminated in the reestablishment of Sino-Soviet relations, all set against the backdrop of escalating Japanese aggression in North-eastern China (Manchuria). This phase demanded adroit diplomacy balancing strength and strategic statecraft. 2. The 1930s, especially in the aftermath of Japan's aggressive incursions into China, saw lim-ited interaction and collaboration between the USSR and the Republic of China. This period featured cautious Soviet-Japanese relations and included significant events such as armed clashes at Lake Khasan and the Khalkhin-Gol River, as well as the signing of the USSR-Japan Neutrality Pact. 3. The era of the Great Patriotic War from 1941 to 1945, during which the Soviet Union's fore-most objective was the defeat of the German Nazi aggressor. During this period, Soviet diplo-macy was primarily preoccupied with relations with Anglo-American allies, with particular emphasis on the contentious issue of opening a second front. Consequently, Far Eastern and Pacific policy concerns assumed a somewhat marginalized role within the realm of Soviet diplomacy. 4. Finally, the period spanning from the winter to the summer of 1945 emerged as a pivotal juncture. During this time, the Soviet Union intensified its political, diplomatic, and military involvement in the Far East, all against the backdrop of preparations for the impending en-try into the war against Japan. Diplomatic endeavors reached their zenith during this critical phase.																			2071-8160	2541-9099					2023	16	6					92	123		10.24833/2071-8160-2023-6-93-92-123	http://dx.doi.org/10.24833/2071-8160-2023-6-93-92-123													WOS:001179742600006

A total of 67 fishes were caught from the Musa estuary during five intervals of 15 days in the summer of 2013. After biometric measurements were conducted, the concentrations of mercury and vanadium were measured in the muscle tissue of fish using a direct method analyzer (DMA) and a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer, respectively. The mean concentration of mercury and vanadium in the muscle tissue of fish was 3.154 +/- 1.981 and 2.921 +/- 0.873 mg/kg w.w, respectively. The generalized linear model (GLM) analysis showed a significantly positive relationship among mercury concentration, length, and weight (P = 0.000). In addition, there was a significantly negative relationship between vanadium concentration and fish length (P = 0.000). A reverse association was found between concentrations of mercury and vanadium. Mercury concentration exceeded the allowable standards of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in J. belangerii (C).

Thermal and chemical stratification of urban ponds: Are they 'completely mixed reactors'?	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS												We examined whether relatively small urban ponds behave as 'completely mixed reactors' by measuring the stability and vertical heterogeneity of water column parameters. To do this, we measured profiles of water temperature and conductivity from the pond surface to the water-sediment interface twice during summer 2009 in 45 stormwater ponds located in the residential landscape of southern Ontario. These data were used to calculate water column stability indices and examine the relative importance of temperature and conductivity in controlling water column stratification. We also measured concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP),total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), particulate phosphorus and nitrogen (seston P and N), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and total suspended solids (TSS) in surface and bottom waters. Despite their shallow depth (0.50-2.8 m), most ponds were stratified on the day of sampling and had relatively stable water columns both in June and August. Temperature differences rather than conductivity differences were better related to water column stability. Despite relatively stable water columns, vertical differences were not found for most water chemistry parameters, suggesting either recent mixing or relatively slow biogeochemical processing. Top-bottom differences were observed in June and August for DO and in June for TDN, seston N and TSS, reflecting a combination of processes influencing water column chemistry.

Previous work suggested that arid northwestern China was characterized by a dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP, from ca. 1000 to 1300AD) and a wet Little Ice Age (LIA, from ca. 1400 to 1850AD), but there is a lack of studies addressing the issue of climatic variability during the last millennium. Here, we present results from a diverse range of proxy records from northwestern China with the aim of evaluating the time variation of hydroclimatic variability during the MWP and LIA. Within the context of an overall cold climate, we detected a pattern of higher moisture variability during the LIA compared to the MWP. A comparison of the proxy records of climatic instability during the LIA from northwestern China with the major modes of SST and atmospheric variability, which affect moisture/precipitation in Asia, suggests that the instability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) from middle- to high-latitude regions during the LIA was a major driving factor. The westerlies may play an important role in linking the unstable climatic conditions observed in the above-mentioned regions. Our results support the concept that climatic instability was above the norm during cold periods, in contrast with present observations that demonstrate the occurrence of increasingly extreme climatic events with ongoing global warming.

J	Gillespie, J				Gillespie, Josephine			Catch 22: wetlands protection and fishing for survival	GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH												Environmental regulation of biodiversity hotspots, including wetlands, is of increasing importance in an era when species and habitat loss is common. A number of global environmental protection regimes attempt to set up processes that protect vulnerable species and their habitats. One such regulatory regime, the Ramsar Convention (Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat), provides overarching protection for hundreds of wetlands around the world. In this paper, one Ramsar listed wetland, Southeast Asia's and Cambodia's largest freshwater lake, the Tonle Sap, is subject to a legal geographical analysis. A legal geography approach - one that puts front and centre an examination of both the environmental protection regulations for the wetlands and the people subject to them - enables the complexity of the legal-human-environment dynamic in this unique wetlands to be revealed. Measuring the success, or otherwise, of environmental protection regulations requires an understanding of both the biophysical and social dynamics of the place subject to that protection. Geographers, particularly legal geographers, are well placed to document the human-environment dimensions of place and to expose fragilities or disconnections between regulations and place. Regulations that do not take adequate account of complex people-place dynamics are likely to fall short of expectations and run the risk of becoming self-defeating, giving rise to a potential catch-22 scenario.

J	YOON, WB; BENNER, R				YOON, WB; BENNER, R			DENITRIFICATION AND OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION IN SEDIMENTS OF 2 SOUTH TEXAS ESTUARIES	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Spatial and temporal variations in rates of denitrification and oxygen consumption were measured in sediments of the Nueces and Guddalupe Estuaries in southern Texas, USA. Denitrification rates varied from 4.0 to 71.1 mumol N2 m-2 h-1 in the Nueces Estuary and from 4.6 to 34.7 mumol N2 m-2 h-1 in the Guadalupe Estuary. Denitrification accounted for 29 to 80 % of total benthic N flux in the study areas. Oxygen consumption rates ranged from 176 to 818 mumol O2 m-2 h-1 in Nueces Estuary and from 208 to 550 mumol O2 m-2 h-1 in Guadalupe Estuary. In both estuaries denitrification and oxygen consumption rates were generally higher in the upper estuaries where the porosity and organic matter contents of sediments were typically highest. Among 3 measurements in different seasons, the lowest denitrification and oxygen consumption rates were usually observed during winter. Chemical oxygen consumption, as measured using formalin-killed controls, was about 50 % of the total oxygen consumption. A considerable portion (ca 50 %) of biological oxygen consumption was attributed to nitrification in sediments. We estimated that carbon mineralization by denitrifiers was as much as 40 to 179 % of that by aerobic heterotrophs. In the Guadalupe Estuary, denitrification removed about 38 % of the measured inputs of organic and inorganic nitrogen. In the Nueces Estuary, the amount of nitrogen removed by denitrification was ca 2 times greater than the measured nitrogen inputs from the Nueces River and precipitation, suggesting that unmeasured anthropogenic inputs along the perimeter of the estuary were very important for maintaining nitrogen balance.

Antarctic microbial mats: A modern analog for Archean lacustrine oxygen oases	GEOLOGY												The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis was the most important geochemical event in Earth history, causing the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) similar to 2.4 b.y. ago. However, evidence is mixed as to whether O-2 production occurred locally as much as 2.8 b.y. ago, creating O-2 oases, or initiated just prior to the GOE. The biogeochemical dynamics of possible O-2 oases have been poorly constrained due to the absence of modern analogs. However, cyanobacteria in microbial mats in a perennially anoxic region of Lake Fryxell, Antarctica, create a 1-2 mm O-2-containing layer in the upper mat during summer, providing the first known modern analog for formation of benthic O-2 oases. In Lake Fryxell, benthic cyanobacteria are present below the oxycline in the lake. Mat photosynthesis rates were slow due to low photon flux rate (1-2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) under thick ice cover, but photosynthetic O-2 production was sufficient to sustain up to 50 mu mol O-2 L-1, sandwiched between anoxic overlying water and anoxic sediments. We hypothesize that Archean cyanobacteria could have similarly created O-2 oases in benthic mats prior to the GOE. Analogous mats may have been at least partly responsible for geological evidence of oxidative weathering prior to the GOE, and habitats such as Lake Fryxell provide natural laboratories where the impact of benthic O-2 oases on biogeochemical signatures can be investigated.					; Sumner, Dawn/E-8744-2011; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; Sumner, Dawn/0000-0002-7343-2061; Mackey, Tyler/0000-0001-6377-3797; 													0091-7613	1943-2682				OCT	2015	43	10					887	890		10.1130/G36966.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G36966.1													WOS:000361830400010

Frost flower aerosol effects on Arctic wintertime longwave cloud radiative forcing	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Frost flowers are clusters of highly saline ice crystals growing on newly formed sea ice or frozen lakes. Based on observations of particles derived from frost flowers in the Arctic, we formulate an observation-based parameterization of salt aerosol source function from frost flowers. The particle flux from frost flowers in winter has the order of 10(6)m(-2)s(-1) at the wind speed of 10ms(-1), but the source flux is highly localized to new sea ice regions and strongly dependent on wind speed. We have implemented this parameterization into the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry initialized for two wintertime scenarios. The addition of sea salt aerosol emissions from frost flowers increases averaged sea salt aerosol mass and number concentration and subsequent cloud droplet number. This change of cloud droplet number concentration increases downward longwave cloud radiative forcing through enhanced cloud optical depth and emissivity. The magnitude of this forcing of sea salt aerosols from frost flowers on clouds and radiation, however, contributes negligibly to surface warming in Barrow, Alaska, in the wintertime scenarios studied here.

However, frequent changes in sedimentary facies make palaeoenvironmental interpretation of grain-size variations relatively complicated. In this paper, we employed multiple grain-size parameters to discriminate the sedimentary characteristics of aeolian and fluvial facies in the Dadiwan (DDW) section on the western Chinese Loess Plateau. We found that wind and fluvial dynamics have quite different impacts on the grain-size compositions, with distinctive imprints on the distribution pattern. By using a lognormal distribution fitting approach, two major grain-size components sensitive to aeolian and fluvial processes, respectively, were distinguished from the grain-size compositions of the DDW terrace deposits. The fine grain-size component (GSC2) represents mixing of long-distance aeolian and short-distance fluvial inputs, whilst the coarse grain-size component (GSC3) is mainly transported by wind from short-distance sources. Thus GSC3 can be used to infer the wind intensity. Grain-size variations reveal that the wind intensity experienced a stepwise shift from large-amplitude variations during the last deglaciation to small-amplitude oscillations in the Holocene, corresponding well to climate changes from regional to global context.

J	Sobiech, J; Dierking, W				Sobiech, Jennifer; Dierking, Wolfgang			Observing lake- and river-ice decay with SAR: advantages and limitations of the unsupervised k-means classification approach	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Large parts of the Arctic are covered by water bodies. Ice covers on lakes and rivers prohibit the exchange of heat and water vapor between the water body and the atmosphere. With melt onset, the ecosystem is subjected to changes, making it important to monitor the ice decay. As ground-based monitoring of these vast uninhabited areas is expensive and thus restricted to a few locations, remote-sensing techniques need to be applied. Here we evaluate the performance of the unsupervised k-means classification for dividing ice and water fractions on lakes and river channels from spaceborne radar data in comparison to threshold-based methods. The analysis is based on six TerraSAR-X and three RADARSAT-2 images, obtained during spring 2011 over the central Lena Delta in northern Siberia. The performance of the k-means classification is found to be similar to a fixed-threshold approach. As the k-means classification does not need prior statistical backscatter analyses to account for the radar configuration and ice conditions, it is easier to use than the threshold method. In addition, we found that the application of a low-pass filter prior to the classification of river channels and a closing filter on the classification results of lakes strongly improves the overall classification results.																			0260-3055						2013	54	62	1				65	72		10.3189/2013AoG62A037	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2013AoG62A037													WOS:000321685300011

This species was first reported in the 1990's in the Ligurian and Emilian Apennines (northern Italy), where an extensive limnological campaign carried out from 1998 to 2000 demonstrated that it is quite common, mostly occurring up to an altitude of 1728 in a.s.l. in small pools that dry out in summer. The remarkably broader distribution of this species reported by the present research depends to a large extent on a greater sampling effort in temporary and ephemeral environments. Also, previous identification of calanoids in the study area might have been wrong. The possibility of a recent expansion of M. kupelwieseri in the northern Apennines is discussed. Notes on morphological variability and ecological traits of the species are also offered.

In addition, we tested how mixing of these waters with oligotrophic lake water affected short-term microbial activity and decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). After mire restoration, concentrations of DOC, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), ammonium (NH4-N), and phosphate (PO4-P) increased in mire waters. Concentrations of DOC and organic N also increased after a rainy period in waters running from drained and natural mires. Bacterial production and respiration were strongly correlated with the concentrations of DOC, N, and P. Microbial activity in lake water was stimulated by these compounds in the mire waters. Bacterial growth efficiency was strongly related to the availability of NH4-N. Mixing of lake water with mire waters caused no additional stimulation of DOC decomposition; thus, our results do not support the "priming effect" hypothesis that lake-originated DOC would promote decomposition of recalcitrant mire-originated DOC in oligotrophic headwater lakes.					; Saarnio, Sanna/A-2258-2017	Tahvanainen, Teemu/0000-0002-7856-299X; Saarnio, Sanna/0000-0002-1915-0370; Akkanen, Jarkko/0000-0001-9232-0121													2044-2041	2044-205X					2016	6	1					65	76		10.5268/IW-6.1.903	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-6.1.903													WOS:000371809400006

We monitored nutrients, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, turbidity, chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton levels. The lower biomass in all flowing enclosures showed that flow rate significantly inhibited the growth of phytoplankton. A critical flow rate occurred near 0.06 m/s, which was the lowest relative inhibitory rate. Changes in flow conditions affected algal competition for light, resulting in a dramatic shift in phytoplankton composition, from blue-green algae in still waters to green algae in flowing conditions. These findings indicate that critical flow rate can be useful in developing methods to reduce algal bloom occurrence. However, flow rate significantly enhanced the inter-relationships among environmental variables, in particular by inducing higher water turbidity and vegetative reproduction of periphyton (Spirogyra). These changes were accompanied by a decrease in underwater light intensity, which consequently inhibited the photosynthetic intensity of phytoplankton. These results warn that a universal critical flow rate might not exist, because the effect of flow rate on phytoplankton is interlinked with many other environmental variables.					; Chen, Ruihong/LLK-8175-2024; Zhang, Haiping/R-1035-2019; Li, Feipeng/F-4130-2019	Li, Feipeng/0000-0002-7114-9617; 													0254-4059	1993-5005				MAR	2015	33	2					430	438		10.1007/s00343-015-4063-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4063-4													WOS:000351156800016

While they have been studied well in geological record, investigations of modern outburst flood deposits are relatively rare. Well-preserved flood deposits and landforms caused by the June 2000 landslide dam outburst flood in the Yigong River, eastern Tibet provide an opportunity to evaluate such sedimentological response to a high energy modern event. The sedimentary characteristics of boulder bars and channel evolution over c. 17 km downstream of the breach were investigated by field survey and remote sensing interpretation. The results show that the post-flood channel migrated downstream and increased in curvature. The bar shape is very little changed toward downstream, but the bar area shows a fluctuating decrease. Poorly sorted accumulations composed of massive granular gravels and boulders near the breach indicate sediment-rich bedload depositing processes occurred during rapid rising stage flows. In contrast, there are eddy bars and deposition of fine gravel with horizontally bedded laminations 17 km downstream of the dam, suggesting suspended sediment dominated deposition with a rapid loss of transport capacity. Comparison with previous hydrodynamic simulations indicates that the rates of the rising stage and the falling stage strongly affect the sedimentary characteristics of boulder bars and slackwater deposits.

We show that as a result of its size tidal and atmospheric pressure forcings are large enough to induce vertical displacements of the ice surface above the lake. These effects have been modelled assuming equilibrium tides and an inverse barometer response based on mass conservation. Differences in the tidal potential on the area of the lake result in height changes with amplitudes of a few millimetres for the largest diurnal and semidiurnal tides with maximum values at the southern end of the lake. Air pressure differences above the lake cause a differential inverse barometer effect (BE) with resulting height changes of up to 40 mm on timescales from days to weeks. Both effects could be verified by differential Global Positioning System (GPS) observations in the southern part of the lake during the 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 summer seasons. The measured amplitudes and phases of the main constituents correspond to the respective values of the differential equilibrium tides. ERS-1& 2 tandem interferograms of 1996 were used to analyse the spatial pattern of the surface displacement. For the southern part of the lake, these measurements reveal a bulge with a wide flexure zone of varying amplitude but a similar geometry. A quasi-simultaneous pair of interferograms from the northern and the southern part of the lake respectively, demonstrates surface height changes of opposite sign in both areas. Therefore, it can be concluded that the associated water redistribution as a result of tides and changing atmospheric pressure forms an additional component of the overall water circulation in the lake.

On the Rate of Decline of Persistent Organic Contaminants in Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from the Great Lakes, 1970-2003	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Thirty-four years of data from the Great Lakes Fish Monitoring Program (GLFMP) show significant changes in the behavior of most contaminants in lake trout over time consistent with changes in contaminant inputs following regulation and remediation. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) show positive apparent first-order rate constants falling to near zero. Dieldrin shows relatively unchanging half-lives of around 10 years except in Lake Superior (similar to 25 years). Mirex, consistently detected only in Lake Ontario fish, shows a slow decrease until the 1990s, when remediation of a source site occurred, after which half-lives are 2-3 years. Half-lives of oxychlordane, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane (DDT) and its metabolites were typically 3-6 years until the mid 1980s; since then, the newest data confirm half-lives are usually around 15-30 years. For PCBs, an increasing half-life is found in other media as well. Changes in food web structure, fishery dynamics, and climate undoubtedly affect concentrations but cannot explain observed long-term trends across several media. Concentrations of legacy contaminants in the Great Lakes are likely to continue to decline only slowly and pose a health concern for decades without identifying and containing remaining sources.																			0013-936X					MAR 15	2010	44	6					2004	2010		10.1021/es903191u	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es903191u								20163091					WOS:000275325600022

Citizen science generates reliable migration chronologies to supplement professional surveys for waterfowl habitat management	ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Targeted monitoring by trained professionals has been the standard to inform evidence-based regulatory and conservation planning decisions for migratory waterfowl and other wildlife in North America. As inferential expectations derived from professional surveys grow and funding wanes, decision-makers are turning toward citizen science as supplemental or alternative data sources. However, external validation of citizen science data, in cooperation with experts, is recommended before their use in management decisions. We compiled data from professional surveys across 7 U.S. states within the Upper Mississippi / Great Lakes Joint Venture (JV) for 16 species of waterfowl (ducks, geese, and swans) to compare with and potentially validate temporal trends in weekly relative abundance predictions (i.e., migration curves) by eBird citizen science data. We demonstrated that eBird weekly relative abundance produced similar migration curves to those derived from professional surveys for most species. Concordance between migration curves for uncommon or vagrant species was less reliable, especially at the county level. However, at spatial scales more relevant for regulatory or conservation planning decisions (e.g., state or JV scale), correlation between eBird and professionally derived migration curves increased to adequate levels of concordance for most species (p >= 0.70). We concluded that eBird weekly relative abundance is a suitable supplement to professional surveys to generate migration curves for waterfowl conservation planning during the nonbreeding season. Additionally, states and JVs that lack monitoring at appropriate temporal frequency may consider using eBird relative abundance to derive migration chronologies for priority species that are well-distributed throughout their region. Broadly, we encourage continued external validation of citizen science data-which requires close partnership between researchers and decision-makers-for its wise use in management decisions. center dot Understanding when and where birds occur is critical for effective conservation planning for migratory waterfowl, yet funding for monitoring programs by wildlife professionals continues to decline.center dot We evaluated whether migration data derived from eBird relative abundance supplement professionally collected waterfowl count data by comparing these 2 data sources at 3 spatial scales relevant to management across 7 U.S. states in the Upper Mississippi / Great Lakes Joint Venture region.center dot Migration chronology based on eBird relative abundance data corresponded well with professionally collected count data, particularly for common and widely distributed species upon which most waterfowl conservation planning decisions are based.center dot Results suggest that eBird relative abundance could be used as complementary data to understand the timing and distribution of waterfowl migration to inform habitat management and conservation for waterfowl during autumn-winter, especially where professional monitoring is limited or absent.

Trophic interactions among native and introduced fishes in a northern Patagonian oligotrophic lake	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In summer the littoral zone of Lake Rivadavia contained almost all the juveniles of the native fish species present in the lake together with juveniles of the introduced salmonid Oncorhynchus mykiss. In particular, a high degree of foraging interaction was found among juveniles of the native species Aplochiton zebra and Percichthys trucha and juveniles O. mykiss. Differences in the juvenile assemblage composition, both in the presence and in the relative proportion of the species were associated with areas with different densities of vegetation. The adults of nearly all species were generalized benthic invertebrate predators. Only adults of A. zebra were absent in the littoral. Juvenile and adult O. mykiss were the only fish that preyed on planktonic organisms. Oncorhynchus mykiss was the only species that performed an ontogenetic diet shift between juveniles and adults, changing main prey categories from benthic to planktonic species.

Rheinheimera texasensis sp nov., a halointolerant freshwater oligotroph	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile, non-spore-forming bacterium, designated strain A62-14B(T), was isolated from a constant-temperature, spring-fed, freshwater lake. On the basis of the complete 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain A62-14B(T) was shown to belong to the class Gammaproteobacteria, being most closely related to Rheinheimera sp. HTB082 (96.2% sequence similarity), Rheinheimera baltica (95.01%), Rheinheimera pacifica (96.35%), Rheinheimera perlucida and Alishewanella fetalis (95.9%). The major fatty acids (C-16:1 omega 7c, 38.56%; C-16:0, 19.04%; C-12:0 3-OH, 12.83%; C-18:1 omega 7c, 7.70%) and the motility of strain A62-14B(T) support its affiliation to the genus Rheinheimera. The salt intolerance of strain A62-14B(T), together with the results of other physiological and biochemical tests, allowed the differentiation of this strain from the three species of the genus Rheinheimera with validly published names. Therefore strain A62-14B(T) represents a novel species of the genus Rheinheimera, for which the name Rheinheimera texasensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A62-14B(T) (=ATCC BAA-1235(T) =DSM 17496(T)). The description of the genus Rheinheimera is emended to reflect the halointolerance and freshwater origin of strain A62-1 413(T).

Weight and total length of sampled specimens were not significantly different (P>0.05) in different seasons and sites. Condition factor (K) in C. mrigala was estimated as 0.97-1.05, L. rohita 1.03-1.18 and for C. catla 1.14-1.27. Log transformed regression were used to test the growth. Growth coefficient (b) were measured highest 3.19 and 3.16 in C. mrigala, 3.21 and 3.17 in L. rohita, 3.16 and 3.11 for C. catla at control site while lowest in C. mrigala 3.08 and 3.07, L. rohita 3.08 and 3.06, in C. catla 3.03 and 3.01 at site C during high and low flow respectively. The 'b' results (P<0.001) represented positive allometric growth pattern with lower value during low flow than high flow season in sampled species. Reduction in `b' value in downstream polluted sites indicated adverse effect of aquatic pollution on fish growth. However, the last downstream sampling locality showed more or less stabilized situation with a small recovery as compared to third study area.

The interactions of abiotic and biotic factors influencing perch Perca fluviatilis and roach Rutilus rutilus populations in small acidified boreal lakes	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Four small, acidified boreal lakes, all sustaining populations of perch Perca fluviatilis, roach Rutilus rutilus and pike Esox lucius, were studied in four successive years. Three lakes were moderately acidified (mean pH of 5.61-5.83), while the fourth was more acidic (mean pH of 5.16) and had a sparse population of R. rutilus. Perca fluviatilis density was higher in this lake (1004 ha(-1)) than in the other three (355-717 ha(-1)), where R. rutilus dominated in terms of numbers (981-2185 ha(-1)). Large, potentially predatory, P. fluviatilis were most abundant in the lake with clearest water, and these seemed to have a negative effect on P. fluviatilis density. Perca fluviatilis mean mass was negatively correlated with R. rutilus biomass and was highest in the most acidic lake with the sparse R. rutilus and the highest P. fluviatilis density. Perca fluviatilis mass correlated positively with pH in two lakes (with the highest fish biomass), suggesting that low pH affected P. fluviatilis mass negatively. Perca fluviatilis growth correlated positively with summer (July to August) air temperature in the lake with sparse R. rutilus, thus differing from P. fluviatilis and R. rutilus growth in the other three lakes. The mean age of P. fluviatilis was generally lower than that of R. rutilus and was lowest in the two lakes with the highest fish biomass, indicating that adult mortality was affected by density-induced factors.

Rare-earth element distribution in water from El Chichon Volcano Crater Lake, Chiapas Mexico	GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL												This research can be regarded as a pilot study at El Chichon Volcano to assess whether REE distributions can be used as routinely geochemical tracers in the Crater Lake geothermal system. Eighteen lake water samples were collected during 3 field campaigns (Group 1, Group 2, and Group 3) from March 2006 to May 2008 at the same sites around the lake. The chemical data has documented the temporal evolution of the hydrothermal system as changes in major element chemistry. However, these samples do not evidence significant variations in the REE geochemistry corresponding to the observed volcanic stability during this period. The concentrations of the REE ranged between 5.58 ppb (Ce) and 0.01 ppb (Lu). Lake water from El Chichon Volcano show HREE enriched patterns with respect to the 1982 pumice samples (as representative of the host rock). The small Eu anomaly observed in recent samples may be due to the increase of complexing agents such as soluble sulfates, chlorides and fluorides.

However, the dominant cyclicity and the mechanism of orbital-scale precipitation variations remain under extensive debate. Here, we used a newly drilled core from the Tianyang (TY) maar lake (South China) to reconstruct Asian monsoon precipitation variations over the past similar to 250,000 years, providing a new independent paleoprecipitation record for the core tropical monsoon region. The measured magnetic susceptibility and grain size records of TY maar lake reveal dominant precession and semiprecession cycles, evidencing the low-latitude insolation forcing on tropical monsoon precipitation variations. Feedbacks of Intertropical Convergence Zone shifts and orbital-scale El Nino/Southern Oscillation variations are suggested to play important roles in this forcing mechanism. Moreover, we detected correlation between the rainstorms and the tropical zonal sea surface temperature gradient during the moderate Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a. This correspondence further confirms the effect of tropical internal feedbacks on orbital-scale precipitation variations. However, the glacial-interglacial cycle is weak in our record, indicating that the variability of Asian monsoon precipitation is likely modulated by certain other processes such as latitudinal effects and air-sea feedback.					; Lu, Fuzhi/F-2737-2014; Dong, Xiaoyi/AAC-8666-2019; Huber, Matthew/A-7677-2008	Wang, Yao/0009-0009-4245-7731; Lu, Huayu/0000-0002-6306-6985; Huber, Matthew/0000-0002-2771-9977; Lu, Fuzhi/0000-0002-0939-9324													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAY	2022	58	9-10					2269	2280		10.1007/s00382-021-06004-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-021-06004-3		OCT 2021											WOS:000709686800001

G.; Bailey, Richard M.; Davies, Lauren			From landform to process: Morphology and formation of lake-bed barchan dunes, Makgadikgadi, Botswana	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A suite of crescentic landforms is visible from remotely sensed imagery within the Ntwetwe panPan in the Makgadikgadi basin, Botswana. We investigate the most distinct of these landforms using morphometric measurements, sedimentary data and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) signal analysis. Comparative analysis with previously published barchan morphological data sets suggest the Ntwetwe features fall within the spectrum of morphometric parameters found in a range of barchan dunefields from around the world. There is currently insufficient comparative morphometric data from sub-aqueous dunefields to be able to distinguish the particular formative environment of the dune. OSL signal analyses however, support the hypothesis of Grove (1969) [Grove, A.T., 1969. Landforms and climatic change in the Kalahari and Ngamiland. Geographical Journal, 135: 191-212] that the last deposition of the sediments within the Ntwetwe forms was most likely aeolian in origin. Luminescence signal analysis is employed to investigate potential transport and bleaching environments of the sediments forming the features, but results in this case do not shed further light on the formative conditions of these enigmatic landforms.

Risk assessment of heavy metal contamination in sediments of a tropical lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The risk assessment of heavy metal contamination was carried out in sediments of an urban tropical lake system (Akkulam-Veli) under threat from rapid unplanned urbanization and poor sewage management. Heavy metals were selected due to their persistent and bioaccumulative nature. Sequential extraction of the metals was carried out to resolve the sediments to their component phases. Well-established models were employed for risk analysis. The two pathways of contamination-ingestion and dermal contact-were considered for assessing risk. Risk Assessment Code of each metal was determined based on the lability of it in the different component phases. Cd was found to be the most hazardous metal by virtue of its high concentration in exchangeable and carbonate phases. Hazard indices of the metals were determined based on their total concentration in Akkulam-Veli (AV) Lake sediments. All heavy metals studied fall well below the threshold limit. However, Cr, Pb, and As, on account of their known toxicity, need to be monitored. Ni content in the lake system could potentially cause cancer to 134 adults in a population of one million. Concentrations of other metals are at carcinogenically safe limits. The study stresses the looming hazard faced by the Akkulam-Veli Lake system by heavy metal contaminants and the urgency in formulating remedial management plans.

Reconstruction of historical atmospheric Pb using Dutch urban lake sediments: A Pb isotope study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake sediments provide a record of atmospheric Pb deposition and changes in Pb isotope composition. To our knowledge, such an approach has not previously been performed in The Netherlands or linked to national air monitoring data. Results are presented for Pb content and isotope composition of Cs-137 dated lake sediments from 2 Dutch urban lakes. Between 1942 and 2002 A.D. anthropogenic atmospheric Pb deposition rates in the two lakes varied from 12 +/- 2 to 69 +/- 16 mu g cm(-2) year(-1). The rise and fall of leaded gasoline is clearly reflected in the reconstructed atmospheric Pb deposition rates. After the ban on leaded gasoline, late 1970s/early 1980s, atmospheric Pb deposition rates decreased rapidly in the two urban lakes and the relative contributions of other anthropogenic Pb sources - incinerator ash (industrial Pb) and coal/galena increased sharply. Atmospheric Pb deposition rates inferred from the lake record a clear relationship with nearby measured annual mean air Pb concentrations. Based on this relationship it was estimated that air Pb concentrations between 1942 and 2002 A.D. varied between 5 and 293 ng/m(3). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hou, JZ; Tian, Q; Wang, MD				Hou, Juzhi; Tian, Qian; Wang, Mingda			Variable apparent hydrogen isotopic fractionation between sedimentary n-alkanes and precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The hydrogen isotope ratio values of sedimentary leaf wax n-alkanes (delta D-wax) have been considered a reliable proxy for precipitation isotope ratios (delta D-P) across various transects on a global basis. Records of delta D-wax have been used to infer past changes in hydrology, climate and altimetry, assuming nearly constant apparent hydrogen isotopic fractionation (epsilon(wax-P)) between sedimentary leaf wax components and precipitation. Here, we present the results of an analysis of delta D-wax values from the surface sediments of 22 lakes across a precipitation and vegetation gradient on the Tibetan Plateau. The delta D-wax values correlated significantly with mean annual precipitation delta D (r 0.90) and summer precipitation delta D (r 0.91), suggesting that delta D-wax can record delta D-P in very dry regions. However, epsilon(wax-P) varies with annual precipitation as well as with relative humidity. Calculation using Craig-Gordon isotope models showed that the variable epsilon(wax-P) values likely resulted from intensive soil evaporation and plant evapotranspiration in this relatively arid region. This implies that variable isotopic fractionation should be taken into consideration when reconstructing paleohydrology, paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yang, XP				Yang, XP			Late quaternary evolution and paleoclimates, western Alashan Plateau, Inner Mongolia, China	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												The western Alashan Plateau of Inner Mongolia, China, is a potentially important region for understanding late Quaternary atmospheric circulation changes associated with shifts in the westerlies and the Asian monsoon climate systems. As a result of past and present geomorphic processes, the present-day topography is dominated by megadunes, desert plains, lake beds, pediments and desert gorges. The megadunes consist of active and relict formations. The consolidated surfaces of dunes, ancient lake sediments and terraces of the dune fields and their margins show a roughly 10 ka-scale periodic appearance of a more humid climate. The chronology was provided by comparison of radiocarbon dates obtained from different landforms. Sedimentological analysis of sand samples confirms the diversity of dune sand sources and the long existence of lakes among the dunes. The alluvial fans and desert gorges are evidences of past fluviatile processes. The increased precipitation at ca. 30 ka BP and 19 ka BP is ascribed to the influences of westerly air masses. The Holocene periods of more humid conditions were caused by fluctuations of the Asian summer monsoon.

Overall, the rates of photosynthetic carbon fixed by autotrophic picoplankton during this study were low (0.01-1.5 mg C m(-3) h(-1)). The highest chlorophyll photosynthetic activity of the <3 mu m cell-size fraction was found in spring, when picoeukaryotes predominated and in addition small nanoplankton passed through the filters. The maximum cell-specific photosynthetic rate of carbon fixation by picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes was 2.5 and 6.3 fg C cell(-1) h(-1), respectively. The highest specific carbon fixation rate of autotrophic picoplankton was 11 mu g C mu g(-1) Chl h(-1). The proportional contribution of autotrophic picoplankton to total photosynthesis usually increased with depth. Picocyanobacteria collected from the dark, anaerobic hypolimnion were viable and capable of active photosynthesis when incubated at water depths within the euphotic zone. Maximum rates of photosynthesis (P-max) for picocyanobacteria ranged from 5.4 to 31.4 fg C cell(-1) h(-1) with the highest values in hypolimnetic samples exposed to irradiance. Photosynthetic efficiency (alpha) was similar to 4-fold higher in picocyanobacteria sampled from 40 m than in cells from near-surface waters. Light saturation (I-k) was lower in picocyanobacteria from 40 m, suggesting that these cells were acclimated to lower light intensities. The relative contribution of autotrophic picoplankton to total phytoplankton photosynthesis in Lake Kinneret was low, but occasionally, at seasons and depths where picocyanobacteria or picoeukaryotes were abundant, could account for most of photosynthetic activity.																			0142-7873					AUG	1997	19	8					979	993		10.1093/plankt/19.8.979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.8.979													WOS:A1997XT70200003

It was found that the direct photolysis is the main photodegradation pathway of 24DNP in lake water. On the lake water samples it was also determined the formation and consumption rates of (OH)-O-center dot, by means of the transformation reaction of benzene into phenol. It was found that the rate of direct photolysis prevails over the (OH)-O-center dot phototransformation rate by one-two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the excited triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter and singlet oxygen are expected to play a negligible role in the photodegradation of 24DNP. By modelling the direct photolysis of 24DNP in surface water bodies, one gets a half-life time of 2-10 summer sunny days for water-column depths up to 10 m. This would make the direct photolysis a major pathway for the transformation of 24DNP in freshwaters. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 188 species are presently known from the Mississippi River, including 3 diadromous species and 17 normative species that have established self-sustaining populations in one or more reaches of the Mississippi River. Species are classified into three relative abundance categories and noted as residents, peripherals, introduced (established nonnatives), or strays (introduced but not established). The diversity of fishes varies longitudinally with 78 species in the reach from the headwaters to St. Anthony Falls; 113 and 105 species in the upper (Upper St. Anthony Lock and Dam to Pool 13) and lower (Pools 14-26) impounded reaches, respectively; and 121 and 136 species in the upper (Missouri River confluence to Ohio River confluence) and lower (Ohio River to the Gulf of Mexico outlet) free-flowing reaches, respectively. Although the composition of the Mississippi River fish fauna has changed little despite more than 80 years of habitat alteration, the extirpation of five species in individual reaches of the river may be a forewarning of a system losing resiliency and indicate the need for habitat conservation and rehabilitation to conserve the biodiversity of North America's largest river.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-44-8				2016	84						53	77																WOS:000381782500003

Coniferous trees associated with interdune deposits in the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone formation, Utah, USA	PALAEONTOLOGY												The Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone Formation of south-west USA represents one of the largest erg deposits ever to have developed on Earth. Here, we report the widespread occurrence of silicified conifer stumps and trunks within interdune deposits near Moab, south-east Utah. Where present as (par)autochthonous assemblages, trees are associated with the deposits of spring-fed carbonate lakes. A few stumps preserved in growth position are rooted in aeolian sandstone immediately below the lake deposits, and evidently established on interdune soils in response to a rising water table. Following at least several decades of growth, trees were killed as the water table continued to rise forming shallow lakes containing ostracodes. Where present as allochthonous assemblages, randomly orientated tree trunks are associated with massive sandstone beds interpreted as fluidized mass flow deposits. These may have formed when dune slip-faces collapsed during occasional heavy downpours of rain, destroying stands of trees. The occurrence of large conifers over a wide area of the Navajo Sandstone Formation in south-east Utah may record long-lived pluvial episodes during which the dune field stabilized, or reflect the erg-margin position of the localities.					; Falcon-Lang, Howard/D-8465-2011	Parrish, Judith/0000-0001-9873-0033; 													0031-0239					JUL	2007	50		4				829	843		10.1111/j.1475-4983.2007.00689.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4983.2007.00689.x													WOS:000248687700005

The clones were isolated from oligo-mesotrophic alpine Lake Mondsee, Austria, during summer and kept in culture with the small cryptophyte Cryptomonas sp. as food. All parameters investigated revealed significant clonal differences among both species. The extent of the clonal differences was comparable to differences observed earlier between similar planktonic ciliate species. The ecological relevance of varying clonal growth rates was evaluated using a simple numerical model. The model outcome suggests that differences in growth rates by 10% may significantly alter the clonal composition in the course of a ciliate peak in temperate lakes. The experimental results and the model outcome are discussed in the context of the functional diversity of freshwater ciliates. It is concluded that the morphospecies concept, which is the most widely used concept by both ciliate taxonomists and ecologists, may severely underestimate the ecological plasticity and the functional diversity of aquatic ciliates.

Our results show that different taxonomic and functional groups occurred within the mesozooplankton community along an offshore-inshore-oriented transect. Some groups occurred mostly offshore (i.e. euphausiids, fish larvae, stomatopods, amphipods), while others occurred in higher abundance inshore (i.e. medusae, chaetognaths, siphonophores, ostracods). Early life stages of ecologically key species, such as Euphausia vallentini and pelagic stages of Munida gregaria, occurred mostly at the Golfo de Penas. Higher trophic positions estimated from delta 15N occurred in mesozooplankton groups inshore (Baker Channel) and lower at the Golfo de Penas, coinciding with the decrease in C:N ratio in zooplankton and with an increase in chlorophyll-a values in the seawater seawards. The delta 13C distribution in the zooplankton groups along the offshore-inshore transect showed a positive gradient from the inshore most stations towards the Baker Channel mouth, suggesting a negative relationship with freshwater carrying terrestrial organic carbon and a positive relationship with seawater. However, from the channel mouth seawards, a decrease in delta 13C in most zooplankton groups occurred. Within the Baker Channel, low delta 13C values occurred in particulate organic matter (POM) at the surface layer, higher values at intermediate depths, and low values at the deepest zones. This uneven distribution of delta 13C values in POM and zooplankton, along with the presence of different water masses at different depths suggest an along-basin transport of organic carbon of different sources at different layers: of terrestrial origin at surface, marine origin at mid depth, and from degraded organic matter from offshore entering at higher depths. Thus, a complex scenario of lateral transport of water of different characteristics modulates the presence of zooplankton in different locations and their food sources along the area. These findings resemble others observed in further south in the Beagle Channel (57 degrees S) also in spring but the relative contribution of different carbon sources may differ between Patagonian systems.

J	Tokarev, I; Yakovlev, E				Tokarev, Igor; Yakovlev, Evgeny			Non-Equilibrium Uranium as an Indicator of Global Climate Variations-The World Ocean and Large Lakes	WATER												In natural water, as a rule, there is a violation of radioactive equilibrium in the chain U-238 horizontal ellipsis -> U-234 -> Th-230 ->. Groundwater usually has a U-234/U-238 ratio in the range of 0.8-3.0 (by activity). However, in some regions, the U-234/U-238 ratio reaches >10 and up to 50. Ultrahigh excesses of U-234 can be explained by climatic variations. During a cold period, minerals accumulate U-234 as a normal component of the radioactive chain, and after the melting of permafrost, it is lost from the mineral lattice faster than U-238 due to its higher geochemical mobility. This hypothesis was tested using data on the isotopic composition of uranium in the chemo- and bio-genic formations of the World Ocean and large lakes, which are reservoirs that accumulate continental runoff. The World Ocean has the most significant U-234 enrichments in the polar and inland seas during periods of climatic warming in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. In the bottom sediments of Lake Baikal, the U-234/U-238 ratio also increases during warm periods and significantly exceeds the U-234 excess of the World Ocean. Furthermore, the U-234/U-238 ratio in the water of Lake Baikal and its tributaries increases from north to south following a decrease in the area of the continuous permafrost and has a seasonal variation with a maximum U-234/U-238 ratio in summer. The behavior of U-234 in large water reservoirs is consistent with the hypothesis about the decisive influence of permafrost degradation on the anomalies in U-234/U-238 ratios in groundwater.

Cu, As, Fe and Mn, also detected in the snow, were found only at low concentrations in waters under ice. Measured, total amounts of Zn, Cd and Pb in the top 1 m of Hamell and Thompson Lakes [Canada] accounted for only 17, 16 and 3%, respectively, of available input of these metals in the snowpack on Hamell Lake; 55, 10 and 2.3%, respectively, on Thompson Lake. These figures were all .ltoreq. soluble portions of these metals in precipitation collections. Apparently only soluble portions of metals in smelter emissions were responsible for elevating metal concentrations in these lakes.																			0143-148X						1981	2	1					11	19		10.1016/0143-148X(81)90004-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0143-148X(81)90004-5													WOS:A1981KU91300002

Distinct and diverse anaerobic bacterial communities in boreal lakes dominated by candidate division OD1	ISME JOURNAL												Lakes have a central role in the carbon cycle of the boreal landscape. These systems typically stratify in summer and their hypolimnetic microbial communities influence burial of biogenic organic matter in sediments. The composition of bacterial communities in these suboxic habitats was studied by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons from five lakes with variable dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Bacterioplankton communities in the hypolimnetic waters were clearly different from the surface layer with candidate division OD1, Chlorobi and Bacteroidetes as dominant community members. Several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with candidate division OD1 were abundant and consistently present in the suboxic hypolimnion in these boreal lakes. The overall representation of this group was positively correlated with DOC and methane concentrations. Network analysis of time-series data revealed contrasting temporal patterns but suggested similar ecological roles among the abundant OTUs affiliated with candidate division OD1. Together, stable isotope data and taxonomic classification point to methane oxidation and autotrophic denitrification as important processes in the suboxic zone of boreal lakes. Our data revealed that while hypolimnetic bacterial communities are less dynamic, they appear to be more diverse than communities from the oxic surface layer. An appreciable proportion of the hypolimnetic bacteria belong to poorly described phyla.

However, a lack of longer-term cold-season temperature records from mid-latitudes hampers our understanding of the forcing mechanisms of this temperature variability. Here we report a Group 1 alkenone-based high-resolution record of cold-season temperatures extending to the pre-industrial era (since 1700 CE) from Lake Luming in northeastern China. By comparing with the instrumental and historical records in the region, we verify the high efficacy of Group 1 alkenones as recorders of cold-season temperature variability. Our record shows pre-industrial warmth between 1750 and 1850 CE relative to anthropogenic industrial period (since 1850 CE), which is largely driven by variability of the Arctic Oscillation, with a negligible contribution from anthropogenic greenhouse-gas forcing. Our results highlight the importance of internal atmospheric circulation in driving cold-season temperatures in northeastern China. Plain Language Summary Frequent occurrence of extreme cold events in northern mid-latitudes during the last few decades imposes significant social and economic impacts. Past reconstructions of longer-term cold-season temperature variability are of crucial importance for understanding past and future cold anomalies. Here we use a paleothermometer proxy based on Group 1 alkenone lipid biomarkers to reconstruct cold-season temperature variability of the last similar to 300 years from a freshwater lake in northeastern China. Our cold-season reconstruction is confirmed by the instrumental and historical records in the region. We show a relatively warm cold-season climate during the pre-industrial period of 1750-1850 CE relative to the period since the industrial revolution (since 1850 CE). More positive cold-season Arctic Oscillation (AO) conditions, rather than anthropogenic greenhouse-gas forcing, may explain this warmth, which is associated with the AO-induced reduction of cold air outbreaks over northeastern China. Our study suggests that internal atmospheric circulation has played an important role in driving cold-season temperature variability in northeastern China on our study timescales.					; Cai, Yanjun/A-9462-2010; Cheng, Hai/H-3413-2017; CHENG, HAI/H-3413-2017; Cai, Yanjun/GYD-6104-2022	liang, Jie/0000-0003-2726-923X; Cai, Yanjun/0000-0001-7063-5050; Vachula, Richard/0000-0001-5559-6540; Cheng, Hai/0000-0002-5305-9458; Huang, Yongsong/0000-0002-9287-4543; Yao, Yuan/0000-0002-9833-5639; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 28	2023	50	10							e2023GL103591	10.1029/2023GL103591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL103591													WOS:000999868500001
J	Moog, DB; Whiting, PJ				Moog, DB; Whiting, PJ			Climatic and agricultural contributions to changing loads in two watersheds in Ohio	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Trends in climatic variables, streamflow, agricultural practices, and loads of nutrients and suspended solids were estimated for 1976-1995 in the Maumee and Sandusky watersheds, two large agricultural basins draining to Lake Erie. To understand the contributions that various factors may have made to the trends in loads, earlier results of models linking loads to explanatory variables were combined with estimated trends in those variables. The study period was characterized by increases in temperature, wintertime precipitation and streamflow, conservation farming, and loads of nitrate and total suspended solids; decreases in snowfall and snow cover, fertilizer, manure from livestock, and loads of soluble reactive phosphorus; and relatively steady exports of total phosphorus. After removing the effects of trends in streamflow, nitrate loads increased much less while total suspended solids and total phosphorus loads declined. The analysis suggests that the nitrate increases were due largely to climatic factors, particularly increases in winter streamflow, decreases in snowfall and snow cover, and declining annual precipitation. Decreases in soluble reactive phosphorus were associated with changes in agricultural practices, particularly declines in fertilizer deliveries and head of livestock.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2002	31	1					83	89											11837448					WOS:000173484300010

At the least polluted sites, the frequency of larval deformities was elevated only slightly compared with reference levels. At these sites, C. cf. plumosus had a bivoltine life cycle and overwintered in the fourth larval instar stage. At moderately contaminated sites, the percentage of prepupal larvae was significantly lower in spring and the development of pupae delayed by 2 wk. At heavily contaminated sites, larval densities were strongly reduced and no pupae were observed at all. Under such conditions, population density seems to be a suitable additional indicator of toxic stress. The frequency of deformed larvae was higher from November to April than from July to October. Maximum frequencies were observed during emergence of the overwintering generation, suggesting that the period between February and April may be the most suitable period for the assessment of this parameter.																			0706-652X					NOV	1992	49	11					2291	2299		10.1139/f92-251	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-251													WOS:A1992KF38800009

Mitigation of environmental extremes as a possible indicator of extended habitat sustainability for lakes on early Mars	INSTRUMENTS, METHODS, AND MISSIONS FOR ASTROBIOLOGY X	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Instruments, Methods, and Missions for Astrobiology X	AUG 28-30, 2007	San Diego, CA	SPIE				The impact of individual extremes on life, such as UV radiation (UVR), temperatures, and salinity is well documented. However, their combined effect in nature is not well-understood while it is a fundamental issue controlling the evolution of habitat sustainability within individual bodies of water. Environmental variables combine in the Bolivian Altiplano to produce some of the highest, least explored and most poorly understood lakes on Earth. Their physical environment of thin atmosphere, high ultraviolet radiation, high daily temperature amplitude, ice, sulfur-rich volcanism, and hydrothermal springs, combined with the changing climate in the Andes and the rapid loss of aqueous habitat provide parallels to ancient Martian lakes at the Noachian/Hesperian transition 3.7-3.5 Ga ago. Documenting this analogy is one of the focuses of the High-Lakes Project (HLP). The geophysical data we collected on three of them located up to 5,916 m elevation suggests that a combination of extreme factors does not necessarily translate into a harsher environment for life. Large and diverse ecosystems adapt to UVR reaching 200%-216% that of sea level in bodies of water sometimes no deeper than 50 cm, massive seasonal freeze-over, and unpredictable daily evolution of UVR and temperature. The HLP project has undertaken the first complete geophysical and biological characterization of these lakes and documents how habitability is sustained and prolonged in declining lakes despite a highly dynamical environment. The same process may have helped life transition through climate crises over time on both Earth and Mars.

J	KLAPWIJK, A; SNODGRASS, WJ				KLAPWIJK, A; SNODGRASS, WJ			MODEL FOR LAKE-BAY EXCHANGE FLOW	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Transient inflows and outflows of water between Lake Ontario and Hamilton Harbor [Ontario, Canada] driven by lake seiches, can be parameterized as a 2-directional exchange flow. Estimates of exchange flow made from current measurements by other result in unlikely values. A model is developed for exchange flow during summer stratification in which 2 distinct flow patterns exist, lake water enters the harbor''s hypolimnion, displacing an equal volume of hypolimnetic water to the epilimnion and then of epilimnetic water to the lake and lake water exchanges directly with the harbor''s epilimnion. The temporal variation of exchange flows are estimated from a TDS [total dissolved solids] budget and temperature data. They suggest that weekly estimates of epilimnetic exchange vary from 1-5 times Q (the average annual flow rate) while hypolimnetic exchange varies from 0-15 times Q for a 3-yr period. The calculations suggest that stratification and lake seiches significantly increase the pumping action of exchange flow in summertime compared to the remainder of the year.																			0380-1330						1985	11	1					43	52		10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71742-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71742-X													WOS:A1985AES0100006

A 14 000 year sedimentary charcoal record of fire from the northern Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe Basin, California, USA	HOLOCENE												This research examines how the controls of fire episode frequency in the northern Sierra Nevada have varied at different temporal scales through the Holocene. A 5.5 m long sediment core was collected from Lily Pond, a similar to 2.5 ha lake in the General Creek Watershed on the west shore of Lake Tahoe in the northern Sierra Nevada in California, USA Dendrochronology was used to reconstruct the recent history of fire, and high-resolution charcoal analysis was used to reconstruct fire episodes for the last 14 000 cal. yr BP. Fire episode frequency was low during the Lateglacial period but increased through the middle Holocene to a maximum frequency around 6500 cal. yr BP. During the late Holocene fire episode frequency generally declined except for noted peaks around 3000 cal. yr BP and 1000-800 cal. yr BP. These variations track major climatic and vegetation changes driven by millennial-timescale variation in the seasonal cycle of insolation and regional decadal- and centennial-scale variation in effective moisture in the mid and late Holocene in the Sierra Nevada. tire episode frequency during the Holocene in the Lake Tahoe Basin varied in response to decadal-, centennial-and millennial-scale climatic variability Current fire episode frequency on the west shore of lake Tahoe is at one of its lowest points in at least the last 14 000 years. Given the strong relationship between climate and fire episode frequency, warming due to increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may increase fire episode frequency to levels experienced during the 'Mediaeval Warm-Period' or the early-Holocene summer insolation maximum as periods of drought intensify.

Biotic control of stream fluxes: Spawning salmon drive nutrient and matter export	ECOLOGY												Organisms can control movements of nutrients and matter by physically modifying habitat. We examined how an ecosystem engineer, sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), influences seasonal fluxes of sediments, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in streams of southwestern Alaska. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether salmon act as net importers or net exporters of matter and nutrients from streams and how these roles change as a function of salmon population density. We measured discharge and concentrations of suspended sediments and total N and P every 7-14 days for up to four summers in 10 streams spanning a gradient in salmon densities. We statistically allocated whole-season fluxes to salmon activities, such as excretion and bioturbation, and to export by hydrologic discharge. In addition, we used counts of spawning salmon to estimate nutrient and matter imports by salmon to streams. Large seasonal pulses of suspended sediments, P, and N were associated with salmon spawning activities, often increasing export an order of magnitude higher than during pre-salmon levels. Years and streams with more salmon had significantly higher levels of export of sediments and nutrients. In addition, years with higher precipitation had higher background export of P and N. Salmon exported an average of the equivalent of 189%, 60%, and 55% of total matter, P, and N that salmon imported in their bodies. The relative magnitude of export varied; salmon exported more than their bodies imported in 80%, 20%, and 16% across all streams and years for sediments, P, and N, respectively. A bioassay experiment indicated that the P exported by salmon is directly available for use by primary producers in the downstream lake. These results demonstrate that salmon not only move nutrients upstream on large spatial scales via their migration from the ocean and subsequent death, but also redistribute matter and nutrients on finer spatial scales through their spawning activities.

Optimizing Spray Technology and Nitrogen Sources for Wheat Grain Protein Enhancement	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Increasing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain protein concentration (GPC) without excessive nitrogen (N) inputs requires understanding the interactions between N source characteristics and application technology parameters. This study evaluated the effects of foliar N applications at anthesis on wheat grain yield and GPC across three locations over three growing seasons in Oklahoma. Treatments consisted of two N sources (urea-ammonium nitrate [UAN] and aqueous urea [Aq. urea]), three nozzle types (flat fan [FF], 3D, and twin [TW]), and two droplet types (fine and coarse). Late foliar applications increased GPC by 12% without affecting grain yield (0.5-5.8 Mg ha-1). During the 2020-21 growing season, a late season freeze during anthesis resulted in no significant differences in GPC across locations. UAN produced significantly higher GPC (13.7%) than Aq. urea (13.1%). Among nozzle types, the 3D nozzle consistently produced the highest GPC (13.8%), compared to FF (13.1%) and TW nozzles (13.2%). Two-way interactions revealed UAN with fine droplets achieved consistently high GPC (14.6%), as did Aq. urea with coarse droplets (14.5%) at Lake Carl Blackwell in 2021-22 as compared to Aq. Urea_Fine (13.8%). At Chickasha 2021-22 and Perkins 2020-21, a significant three-way interaction was observed, with the UAN_3D_Fine (13.2%) and UAN_3D_Coarse (12.2%) treatments producing the highest GPC, with 8% and 15% greater than the Aq. Urea_TW_Fine, respectively, which is lowest. These findings provide a foundation for precision agriculture approaches that optimize foliar N application parameters to enhance wheat quality while maintaining sustainable production practices.

The deterioration of surface water quality with wastewater is well-known, but less is known about the bacterial community dynamics in the affected surface waters. Understanding the bacterial community characteristics -from the source of contamination, through the watershed to the DW production process-may help safeguard human health and the environment. Results The spatial and seasonal dynamics of bacterial communities, their predicted functions, and potential health-related bacterial (PHRB) reads within the Kokemaenjoki River watershed in southwest Finland were analyzed with the 16S rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing method. Water samples were collected from various sampling points of the watershed, from its major pollution sources (sewage influent and effluent, industrial effluent, mine runoff) and different stages of the DW treatment process (pre-treatment, groundwater observation well, DW production well) by using the river water as raw water with an artificial groundwater recharge (AGR). The beta-diversity analysis revealed that bacterial communities were highly varied among sample groups (R = 0.92, p < 0.001, ANOSIM). The species richness and evenness indices were highest in surface water (Chao1; 920 +/- 10) among sample groups and gradually decreased during the DW treatment process (DW production well; Chao1: 320 +/- 20). Although the phylum Proteobacteria was omnipresent, its relative abundance was higher in sewage and industrial effluents (66-80%) than in surface water (55%). Phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were only detected in sewage samples. Actinobacteria was more abundant in the surface water (>= 13%) than in other groups (<= 3%). Acidobacteria was more abundant in the DW treatment process (>= 13%) than in others (<= 2%). In total, the share of PHRB reads was higher in sewage and surface water than in the DW treatment samples. The seasonal effect in bacterial communities was observed only on surface water samples, with the lowest diversity during summer. Conclusions The low bacterial diversity and absence of PHRB read in the DW samples indicate AGR can produce biologically stable and microbiologically safe drinking water. Furthermore, the significantly different bacterial communities at the pollution sources compared to surface water and DW samples highlight the importance of effective wastewater treatment for protecting the environment and human health.

Disappearing colonies: temporal decline in abundance and nesting of waterbirds in a key Indian wetland	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Indian wetlands face significant risks from habitat loss and climate change, necessitating long-term ecological assessments. This study, conducted over five breeding seasons (2016-2017 to 2019-2020 and 2022-2023), assessed the temporal variations in the diversity and abundance of breeding waterbirds in the Melselvanoor-Kelselvanoor Bird Sanctuary (MKBS), Tamil Nadu, India. Waterbird populations were counted using direct count and block count methods, with perimeter count techniques employed for nest counts. Among the 20 breeding waterbird species recorded, one species Spot-billed Pelican Pelecanus philippensis was Near Threatened as per IUCN Red List. Relative abundance and SIMPER results showed four species-Black-headed Ibis Threskiornis melanocephalus, Spot-billed Pelican, Asian Openbill Anastomus oscitans, and Painted Stork Mycteria leucocephala were the most abundant in the breeding seasons across study periods. A significant decline in breeding waterbirds (89.8%) and total nests (90.5%) were observed from 2016-17 to 2022-23. Rainfall showed a significant negative correlation with both the abundance of the breeding population and the number of nests. November registered the lowest species abundance of nest counts, whereas January and February were the highest in all the study years. Key threats include cattle grazing, the use of forest wood for fuel, fluctuating water levels, and the decline of Acacia nilotica, a major nesting tree. Protecting habitats and ensuring hydrological stability are vital for waterbird conservation. This short-term study highlights the importance of the sanctuary in supporting breeding waterbirds, emphasizing the urgent need for conservation measures.

We analyzed microscale distribution patterns of sympatric plant species in response to ground height. Both the species richness of the whole plant assemblage and the occurrence of many native vascular plants, including two endangered species, were positively correlated with ground elevation, which was directly mediated by I. aristatum var. glaucum tussocks and/or the occurrence of mosses on tussocks. Susceptibility to late spring inundation of microsites on the tussocks was significantly lower than that on bare ground. These results suggest that the facilitation by I. aristatum var. glaucum contributes to maintaining the high species richness of the marsh. Consideration of the facilitation among native vascular plants is necessary for establishing sound conservation plans of wetland vegetation.

Bioremediation was carried out through the use of effective microorganisms. The potential recovery of valuable mineral and organic substances in the form of fertilizers was also examined. The Sloneczko Reservoir is a bathing area and serves many people in the summertime as a place of water recreation. Water quality deteriorated intensively from 2006 as a result of illegal wastewater discharge and the impact of fecal pollution from bathers. The high concentration of nutrients in the water was the cause of the eutrophication process and blooms of cyanobacteria, which pose a threat to human health in the bathing area. The bathing area was also closed many times by sanitary services as a result of exceeding the number of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in the water. At the bottom of the reservoir, there was a layer of sediments with a thickness of 30-70 cm. Thus, the processes of anaerobic decomposition generated odor, causing nuisance in the reservoir area. Water transparency varied from 30 to 50 cm, due to the accumulation of suspensions and biomass of planktonic algae. The reservoir was subjected to microbiological bioremediation in 2017 and 2018 to polluted water treatment and to reduce the organic content of bottom sediments. Already after the first application of biopreparations putrefactive odors and the eutrophication process disappeared at the end of the 2017 summer season. Bioremediation reduced the value of E. coli and E. feacalis to the acceptable level. After the second application in 2018, the organic fraction of the bottom sediments was reduced to a very low level and the water transparency reached the bottom (maximum depth was 2.2 m) throughout the entire bathing area. The effect of the water remediation was maintained until 2019, and the surface water quality remained at a very good level. An important aspect in this case is also the exploitation of bottom sediments, because they are rich in nutrients and organic matter, and therefore it may have some potential as a fertilizer. The recovery of nutrients can be used in plant or pot production. However, they contain compounds that degrade quickly, causing unpleasant odors and threatening the environment. Thus, they should be managed and handled in an environmentally friendly and sustainable way.					; Mazur, Robert/C-7811-2018; Mazurkiewicz, Jakub/ACV-7791-2022	Janczak, Damian/0000-0001-6775-8076; Chmielowski, Krzysztof/0000-0001-9758-0854; Mazurkiewicz, Jakub/0000-0002-7560-4779; Czekala, Wojciech/0000-0002-7750-9265; 														2073-4441				NOV	2020	12	11							3002	10.3390/w12113002	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12113002													WOS:000595000500001

The building of lakes, ponds, and dams has compensated for some of these losses, as was the case in the study area, the artificial wetlands designated as the Natura 2000 (special protection area, SPA) and Ramsar sites. In this context, to evaluate the conservation status of colonial waterbirds (cormorants, herons, and egrets), we analyzed actual distributions, habitat selection, features, and population sizes. Standardized counting of colonial species was used, supplemented by nest counting and colony-area estimation during winter, and drone footage. All species and their colonies were built in artificial or anthropically influenced habitats. Concerning distribution and population sizes, Phalacrocorax carbo and Microcarbo pygmeus were found to nest only in central Romania. The pair numbers of Ardea alba, Ardea purpurea, Ardea cinerea, and Nycticorax nycticorax in the area exceeded 1% of the national minimum breeding population. There was a statistically significant positive trend of breeding populations for Ardea alba, Nycticorax nycticorax, and Egretta garzetta. In conclusion, these artificial wetlands offer optimal breeding conditions for a relatively large diversity of colonial bird species over areas that are not very large.

Glaciers respond to changes in accumulation-season precipitation, ablation-season temperature and redistribution of snow by wind. Hence, reconstructions of glacier fluctuations based on distal glacier-fed lakes may give detailed information about past climate at a potentially high temporal resolution. Yet, the importance of any of these climate components is often difficult to solve. Here, we apply the 'Liestol-relationship', which expresses the relationship between ablation-season temperature and annual accumulation of snow at the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), to the reconstructed local temperature-precipitation-wind ELA (TPW-ELA) to infer the relative importance of winter-balance and ablation-season temperature as causes of reconstructed glacier variation. The reconstructions show a large glacier readvance corresponding with the 8.2-ka cold event and a sequence of eight distinct glacier advances and retreats during the Neoglacial time period bracket between 4300 +/- 40 cal. yr BP and AD 1900. The glacier reached its Holocene maximum position in AD 1773 +/- 29, subsequently followed by an ongoing unprecedented retreat, interrupted only by some minor halts and readvances. Based on a detailed comparison of our results with similar studies of both continental and maritime glaciers, as well as independent temperature proxy records across Scandinavia, we argue that significant and consistent deviations in ELA fluctuations between continental and maritime glaciers in the region are caused by a north-south migration of the arctic polar front. Additionally, we suggest that deviations in ELA fluctuations between Scandinavian maritime and continental glaciers around 7150, 6560, 6000, 5150, 3200 and 2200 cal. yr BP reflect the different response of continental and maritime glaciers to drops in total solar irradiance (TSI).					; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020	Nielsen, Pal Ringkjob/0000-0001-6255-5309; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2016	26	5					736	755		10.1177/0959683615618265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615618265													WOS:000374779000006

The results indicate a strong impact of water level on the year class strength of roach. Constantly high water level with large areas of inundated plants led to a very strong roach year class. Conversely, decreasing water level shortly after the spawning period was found to result in a total loss of the new roach year class. Any other possible factors influencing year class strength of roach (such as food, temperature, winter duration) may only play a role if the water level after spawning remained relatively stable. Consequently, water quantity management in reservoirs can be used as a biomanipulation tool to reduce the planktivorous fish stock and to improve water quality, which should be an interesting option especially in drinking water reservoirs.

The feeding activity of various zooplankton groups was determined in the 0-7 and 7-20 m depth layers, by identifying and quantifying chlorophyll a and its derivatives by high-performance liquid chromatography in samples of phytoplankton and zooplankton. This determination takes into consideration the degradation of these pigments into colourless products during their ingestion by zooplankton. A high mean percentage loss, linked with this degradation, has been observed (81.9 +/- 11.5%). The grazing impact by the whole zooplankton community (expressed as the percentage of water volume swept clear of chlorophyll-containing organisms each day) varied between 1 and 48% day(-1) in the 0-7 m layer (mean value 17.5% day(-1)), and between 0.2 and 19% day(-1) in the 7-20 m layer (mean value 3.8% day(-1)). The calanoid copepod Acanthodiaptomus denticornis was the main grazer from April to mid-July, but its impact was relatively low (<17% day(-1) in both depth layers). From July onwards, cladocerans became abundant and were the crustaceans with the greatest grazing impact (up to 36% day(-1)). The organisms of the 80-315 mu m size class, composed mainly of rotifers, made a major, and sometimes dominant, contribution to grazing, especially in the 7-20 m layer where they accounted for 20-95% of the total grazing by the zooplankton community.																			0142-7873					MAR	1996	18	3					305	322		10.1093/plankt/18.3.305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.3.305													WOS:A1996TZ27200001

The discharge of cold glacial meltwaters into the Great Lakes during pulse TB suppressed downwind summer temperatures in the Finger Lakes region and provided a source of isotopically light precipitation, Published proxy data from Greenland, Norway, and Alaska also record relatively cold paleoclimates following the Younger Dryas, suggesting widespread Northern Hemisphere cooling as a direct result of the rapid melting of the Laurentide ice sheet between 10 and 8 ka.

The temporal and spatial variability of algae blooms makes it difficult to usein situmonitoring of the lakes. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data for monitoring algal blooms in Lake Erie. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)-related products of these sensors were tested by using the Great Lakes Chl-a NOAA's monitoring data over summer 2016 and 2017, respectively. Our results show that while fluorescent light height (FLH) algorithm and models are limited to lakes with Chl-a < 8 mg/m(3), maximum chlorophyll index (MCI) has the potential to be used effectively to monitor Chl-a concentration over Eutrophic lakes. Sentinel-3's MCI is suggested for Chl-a > 20 mg/m(3)and Sentinel-2 MCI for Chla > 8 mg/m(3). Top of atmosphere (TOA) radiances showed a significantly better correlation within situdata compared to TOA reflectance, which may be related to the poor pixel identification during the process of pixel flagging affected by the complexity of Case-2 water. Sentinel-2 MCI achieves better performance for Chl-a retrieval (R-2= 0.92) than the existing methods. However, the FLH algorithms outperformed negative reflectance due to the shift of reflectance peak to longer wavelengths along with increasing Chl-a values.					; Li, Jonathan/AAA-7712-2021	LI, Jonathan/0000-0001-7899-0049; Pirasteh, Saied/0000-0002-3177-037X													0703-8992	1712-7971				SEP 2	2020	46	5					585	602		10.1080/07038992.2020.1823825	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07038992.2020.1823825		SEP 2020											WOS:000572522400001

Landscape evolution is therefore largely controlled by climate-driven periglacial processes. The response of the frozen ground to late Quaternary warm and cold stages is preserved in permafrost sequences, and deducible by multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental approaches. Here, we analyse radiocarbon-dated mid-Wisconsin Interstadial and Holocene lacustrine deposits preserved in the Kit-1 pingo permafrost sequence combined with water and surface sediment samples from nine modern water bodies on Seward Peninsula (NW Alaska) to reconstruct thermokarst dynamics and determine major abiotic factors that controlled the aquatic ecosystem variability. Our methods comprise taxonomical diatom analyses as well as Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Our results show, that the fossil diatom record reflects thermokarst lake succession since about 42 C-14 kyr BP. Different thermolcarst lake stages during the mid-Wisconsin Interstadial, the late Wisconsin and the early Holocene are mirrored by changes in diatom abundance, diversity, and ecology. We interpret the taxonomical changes in the fossil diatom assemblages in combination with both modern diatom data from surrounding ponds and existing micropalaeontological, sedimentological and mineralogical data from the pingo sequence. A diatom based quantitative reconstruction of lake water pH indicates changing lake environments during mid-Wisconsin to early Holocene stages. Mineralogical analyses indicate presence of tephra fallout and its impact on fossil diatom communities. Our comparison of modern and fossil diatom communities shows the highest floristic similarity of modern polygon ponds to the corresponding initial (shallow water) development stages of thermolcarst lakes. We conclude, that mid-Wisconsin thermokarst processes in the study area could establish during relatively warm interstadial climate conditions accompanied by increased precipitation due to approaching coasts, while still high continentality and hence high seasonal temperature gradients led to warm summers in the central part of Beringia.

Late Quaternary chironomid community structure shaped by rate and magnitude of climate change	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Much is known about how climate change impacts ecosystem richness and turnover, but we have less understanding of its influence on ecosystem structures. Here, we use ecological metrics (beta diversity, compositional disorder and network skewness) to quantify the community structural responses of temperature-sensitive chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) during the Late Glacial (14 700-11 700 cal a bp) and Holocene (11 700 cal a bp to present). Analyses demonstrate high turnover (beta diversity) of chironomid composition across both epochs; however, structural metrics stayed relatively intact. Compositional disorder and skewness show greatest structural change in the Younger Dryas, following the rapid, high-magnitude climate change at the Bolling-Allerod to Younger Dryas transition. There were fewer climate-related structural changes across the early to mid-late Holocene, where climate change was more gradual and lower in magnitude. The reduced impact on structural metrics could be due to greater functional resilience provided by the wider chironomid community, or to the replacement of same functional-type taxa in the network structure. These results provide insight into how future rapid climate change may alter chironomid communities and could suggest that while turnover may remain high under a rapidly warming climate, community structural dynamics retain some resilience.					; Doncaster, C./AAT-7621-2020; Langdon, Peter/B-4682-2013; Dearing, John/E-4206-2010	Langdon, Peter/0000-0003-2724-2643; Mayfield, Roseanna/0000-0001-6640-1681; Davies, Kimberley/0000-0002-1748-9442; Doncaster, C.

Nutrient enrichment and depletion on the shoreside of the spring thermal front	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A thermal front was evident within the nearshore zone of the south shore of Lake Ontario near Oak Orchard Creek on 28 May 2008. Here, we characterize nutrient concentrations during thermal bar formation on the shoreside and lakeside of the thermal front within a 5 x 20-km polygon. We observed that total phosphorus levels and turbidity were elevated while silica and nitrate were reduced on the shoreside relative to the offshore of the thermal front. Phosphorus and suspended solid flux from Oak Orchard Creek contributed to elevated turbidity and phosphorus concentrations on the shoreside of the thermal front and were not transported to the lakeside of the thermal front. Two hypotheses, not mutually exclusive, are offered as potential explanations for the observed reduction in silica and nitrate: biological uptake by phytoplankton and benthic algae and long-shore transport of nutrient poor Niagara River water. This work not only demonstrates that nutrient entrapment may occur but also that biological mechanisms function to reduce nutrient levels within the shoreside of the thermal front.

This should occur due to either isolation or because these populations are faced with different selective pressures. The anadromous population Must undergo an extensive migration to reach its spawning grounds, something that is not required of the lacustrine population. To test this hypothesis, we sampled and measured fish from the Arctic Red River (anadromous form) and Travaillant Lake (lacustrine form). Populations were compared by performing: 1) a canonical discriminant analysis on 17 morphological features; and 2) two-way t tests on nine meristic counts. There were significant differences between populations and seasons, with the greatest variation between populations occurring in the fall, during spawning. The pattern of variation in morphology in response to changing seasons was different between the lacustrine and anadromous populations. In an attempt to explain the observed distinction between populations, we test the hypothesis that anadromous broad whitefish are better adapted to migration than lacustrine fish. We examined eight morphological features associated with swimming efficiency. However, the morphological data did not support our hypothesis that the anadromous population was better adapted to migration than the lacustrine population. We conclude that the anadromous and lacustrine populations of broad whitefish are morphologically distinct, but that this difference cannot be due to adaptation for the increased swimming performance required for long distance migration.

However, there is debate concerning the origin of hydrothermal-type ore deposits such as vein-type U and W deposits. The formation, migration, heating and controls on the composition of metal-fertile fluids in active geothermal systems provide insights into the formation of ore-forming fluids. Fluid's metal contents are relatively high in the Yadong-Yangbajing-Naqu (YYN) geothermal belt of South Tibet, and a similar association of enrichment has been found in saline lakes of the region. This study analysed major ions and trace metal contents together with stable (O, H) isotopes of water samples from geothermal springs and wells and regional saline lakes and rivers along the Beng and YYN fault systems. Results demonstrate that metal-fertile geothermal brines, were sourced from the Bangor saline lake. This study highlights the role of evaporation of saline lake water in the formation of metal-fertile brines and the contrasting behaviors of U and W in hydrothermal conditions.					; Richard, Antonin/A-2091-2011	Zhang, Chuang/0000-0002-4051-727X; 													0954-4879	1365-3121				AUG	2023	35	4					313	328		10.1111/ter.12656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ter.12656		APR 2023											WOS:000972060900001

Sinninghe			Assessment of branched glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraether (brGMGT)-based paleothermometry in the 250,000-year sediment record of Lake Chala, equatorial East Africa	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Branched glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGMGTs), a relatively understudied group of bacterial membrane lipids structurally similar to branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), appear to be strongly influenced by temperature in terrestrial settings. In surficial bottom sediments of East African lakes, the abundance of brGMGTs relative to the sum of brGMGTs and brGDGTs (%brGMGT) and brGMGT distribution are strongly related to local mean annual air temperature (MAAT), stimulating development of new paleothermometers. However, applications of these methods to lake-sediment records are currently lacking. Here we investigate brGMGT concentrations and distributions in 916 samples throughout the 250,000-year (250-kyr) sediment sequence from Lake Chala, a presently fresh and permanently stratified (meromictic) tropical crater lake. All seven previously identified brGMGTs occur abundantly, reflected in a relatively high average %brGMGT of 19%. BrGMGTs and brGDGTs concentrations throughout the sequence are strongly correlated (R = 0.83, p < 0.001), suggesting that their producers and/or associated ecological niches substantially overlap. Clear distinction can be made between brGMGTs produced predominantly in the bottom sediments (H1034a and H1034c) versus the anoxic lower water column (H1020a-c and H1034b). Although a 17-month monitoring study of Lake Chala suggested brGMGTs are primarily produced in the sediments, down-core data assign greater importance to aquatic production than previously estimated. Instead of reflecting temperature, %brGMGT variations showed greatest similarity to GDGT proxies reflecting lake depth and/or mixing regime. BrGMGT-based temperature models produce ambiguous reconstructions, showing little similarity to known global temperature trends or the brGDGT-based mean summer temperature (MST) reconstruction from the same sediments.

Yet, many rivers are dammed or run into lakes, and there is growing evidence that CPOM accumulation in river delta participates substantially in ecological processes such as greenhouse gas emissions of lakes and reservoirs. We investigated the transport of CPOM and FPOM by the Leysse River (discharge from 0.2 to 106 m(3) s(-1)) to Lake Bourget (France) in relation to aerial litter deposition, river network length, and discharge. Over a 19-month study period, the volume-weighted mean CPOM and FPOM concentrations were 1.3 and 7.7 g m(-3,) respectively. Most CPOM and FPOM transport occurred during major flood events, and there were power relationships between maximum discharge and particulate organic matter (POM) transport during these events. The annual export of CPOM (190 t AFDM) was 85% of the litter accumulation in autumn on permanent sections of the riverbed (224 t AFDM), which suggests that export is a major process compared to breakdown. Export of CPOM was 1.25 t yr(-1) km(-2) of the forested catchment area. This study highlights the need to account for long-range CPOM transport to describe the fate of litter inputs to streams and to quantify the organic matter input and processing in lakes and reservoirs.																				2073-4441				OCT	2021	13	19							2783	10.3390/w13192783	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13192783													WOS:000809874000001

Main sources and processes affecting dissolved sulphates and nitrates in a small irrigated basin (Lerma Basin, Zaragoza, Spain): Isotopic characterization	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Irrigated agriculture affects the quality of water bodies receiving irrigation return flows by both salinization and nitrate pollution, which are controlled by site-specific factors such as geology or agriculture management. In this work, coupled hydrogeochemistry and isotopic data are used to determine the factors controlling water salinization and nitrate pollution in a small irrigated basin in Northeast Spain. This basin is representative of a large irrigated surface in the Middle Ebro Valley, presenting perched aquifers developed over Quaternary glacis and half of its surface under pressurized irrigation. Identification of the controlling factors and the differences between both environmental problems (salinization and nitrate pollution) were established through chemical composition and stable isotope analyses (delta D and delta O-18-[H2O]; delta S-34 and delta O-18-[SO42]; delta N-15 and delta O-18-[NO3-) of collected samples in groundwater, springs and surface water during the irrigated and the non-irrigated season. The isotopic composition of water indicated no significant evapoconcentration and a higher influence of irrigation water (rather than precipitation water) on the hydrology of the basin. Sulphate was used as a tracer for salinization. There was no positive correlation between nitrate and sulphate, indicating differences in the controlling factors for each compound. Sulphate content was significantly higher in surface water than in groundwater, and a mixture of soil and local gypsum sulphates explained the isotopic composition of most of the collected samples. One sampling location presented samples affected by fertilizers. Nitrate concentration was significantly lower in surface water than in groundwater, with synthetic fertilizers being the main source, especially the ammonia/urea components. The isotopic composition of surface water suggested a low degree of denitrification while circulating in a diffuse pathway over a low permeability substrate. All water quality information was incorporated into a conceptual model of the study site. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Connectivity and complexity of floodplain habitats govern zooplankton dynamics in a large temperate river system	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Large river-floodplain systems are characterised by seasonal flow variability. High flows lead to hydrological connection between the main channel and inundated off-channel lakes, wetlands and floodplains, which provide essential habitats for riverine biota. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) that crustacean zooplankton are more abundant in connected lentic habitats such as riverine lakes and wetlands and have a different community composition compared with the main channel and (ii) that vegetation structure will moderate abundances of crustacean zooplankton in the lower reaches of the Waikato River, New Zealand. Zooplankton densities in main channel inflows and inundated floodplains showed clear seasonal changes, with cladoceran and copepod abundance peaks occurring in the majority of sites 2-3weeks following the peak spring discharges (coinciding with the retreat of water from floodplains into the main channel). Mean densities of zooplankton were highest in the inflows originating from riverine lakes (10-20ind.L-1) where rotifers were dominant. We recorded significantly higher abundances of copepods in peat bog and swamp wetland inflows (c.5ind.L-1) relative to the main river channel and riverine lake inflows (0.1-1ind.L-1). Some lake inflows also had high numbers of cladocerans (5-10 ind.L-1). Inundated floodplains displayed heterogeneity in zooplankton community composition in relation to their structural complexity. Flooded forest accommodated higher numbers of copepods (c.8ind.L-1) and cladocerans (c.17ind.L-1) than flooded grassland, where zooplankton assemblages resembled those in the main river channel and were characterised by dominance of rotifers and low overall zooplankton densities (1-2ind.L-1). Our results suggest that seasonal flow and flood pulses, which determine the degree of connectivity of the main channel with the floodplain and off-channel habitats, govern zooplankton densities and community structure in this large temperate river. Furthermore, the structural complexity of floodplain habitats may play an important role in enhancing riverine zooplankton diversity. We postulate that the post-flood peak of large-bodied cladocerans and copepods might have historically played an important role in the provision of food for juvenile fish such as migrating Galaxiidae.

Large geographical differences in the sensitivity of ice-covered lakes and rivers in the Northern Hemisphere to temperature changes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Based on a unique dataset of more than 50 000 observations of ice phenology from 1213 lakes and 236 rivers in 12 different countries, we show that interannual variations in the timing of ice-on and ice-off on lakes and rivers are not equally pronounced over the entire Northern Hemisphere, but increase strongly towards geographical regions that experience only short periods during which the air temperature falls below 0 degrees C. We explain our observations by interannual fluctuation patterns of air temperature and suggest that lake and river ecosystems in such geographical regions are particularly vulnerable to global warming, as high interannual variability is known to have important ramifications for ecosystem structure and functioning. We estimate that the standard deviation of the duration of ice cover, viewed as a measure of interannual variability, exceeds 25 days for lakes and rivers located on 7% of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere. Such high variability might be an early warning signal for a critical transition from strictly dimictic, ice-covered systems to monomictic, open-water systems. Using the Global Lake and Wetland Database, we suggest that 3.7% of the world's lakes larger than 0.1 km2 are at high risk of becoming open-water systems in the near future, which will have immediate consequences for global biogeochemical cycles.

J	Eid, EM; Shaltout, KH				Eid, Ebrahem M.; Shaltout, Kamal H.			Population dynamics of Eichhornia crassipes (C. Mart.) Solms in the Nile Delta, Egypt	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												The present study aims to evaluate the growth and seasonal allocation of the biomass of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) under natural conditions in the south Mediterranean region (the Nile Delta, Egypt). In this study, the population characteristics (density, morphology and primary production) over a one-growing-season cycle were described. In the Nile Delta, the biomass of the shoot and root systems of E. crassipes was sampled monthly along three water courses from April 2014 to November 2014 using five quadrats (each of 0.5 m x 0.5 m) at each water course. The shoot system started to grow in April (121 g/DM/m(2)), reached a maximum biomass of 887 g/DM/m(2) in July, and then decreased until reaching a minimum of 299 g/DM/m(2) in November. The biomass of the root system increased from 75 g/DM/m(2) in April to a maximum of 235 g/DM/m(2) in August and decreased to a minimum of 100 g/DM/m(2) in November. Water hyacinth allocated ca. 2% of its total biomass to stolons, 22% to laminae, 24% to roots and 52% to petioles. Peak density as high as 144 individual/m(2) occurred in May, but it reduced to 33-50 individual/m(2) during July to November. The average rate of change of biomass was maximum (17.3 g/DM/m(2)/day) during April and May and minimum (-8.9 g/DM/m(2)/day) during October and November. Relative growth rates were found to be lowest during the cooler months, October and November (-0.017 g/DM/g /day), whereas highest yields were recorded during the spring months, April and May (up to 0.044 g/DM/g/day). The correlation coefficients between the water characteristics and the first two canonical correspondence analysis axes indicated that the separation of the population parameters of water hyacinth along the first axis was negatively influenced by Zn. On the other hand, the second axis was positively correlated with electric conductivity, total N, total P, Mg, Na, K and Mn and negatively with pH.					; Eid, Ebrahem/O-2723-2013	Shaltout, Kamal/0000-0002-8588-2991; Eid, Ebrahem/0000-0003-2452-4469; 													0913-557X	1442-1984				OCT	2017	32	4					279	291		10.1111/1442-1984.12154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1442-1984.12154													WOS:000412118300003

Influence of water column stratification and mixing patterns on the fate of methane produced in deep sediments of a small eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, is produced in and emitted from lakes at globally significant rates. The drivers controlling the proportion of produced CH4 that will reach the atmosphere, however, are still not well understood. We sampled a small eutrophic lake (Soppensee, Switzerland) in 2016-2017 for CH4 concentrations profiles and emissions, combined with water column hydrodynamics to investigate the fate of CH4 produced in hypolimnetic sediments. Using a mass balance approach for the periods between April and October of both years, net CH4 production rates in hypolimnetic sediments ranged between 11.4 and 17.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1), of which 66-88% was stored in the hypolimnion, 13-27% was diffused to the epilimnion, and 6-7% left the sediments via ebullition. Combining these results with a process-based model we show that water column turbulent diffusivity (K-z) had a major influence on the fate of produced CH4 in the sediments, where higher K-z values potentially lead to greater proportion being oxidized and lower K-z lead to a greater proportion being stored. During fall when the water column mixes, we found that a greater proportion of stored CH4 is emitted if the lake mixes rapidly, whereas a greater proportion will be oxidized if the water column mixes more gradually. This work highlights the central role of lake hydrodynamics in regulating CH4 dynamics and further suggests the potential for CH4 production and emissions to be sensitive to climate-driven alterations in lake mixing regimes and stratification.

The high alkaline and hypersaline waters (pH > 9.2 and C.E. > 70 mS/cm) of the wetland lake are rich in SO42- (>24,000 mg/l), Cl- (>21,000 mg/l), Na+ (>11,000 mg/l) Mg2+ (>8400 mg/l) and Ca2+ (>1000 mg/l), and are supersaturated for dolomite, calcite and aragonite. Sediments have lower pH values than column waters, oscillating from 8.54 in the low Eh (up to -80.9 mV) central deep sediments and 6.33 in the shallower higher Eh (around -13.6 mV) shore sediments. Erosion of the surrounding olive groves soils produced detrital silicates rich sediments with concretions of carbonate or sulfate. Aragonite (up to 19 %) and pyrite (up to 13 %) are mainly concentrated in the organic matter rich samples from the upper part of the sediment cores, whereas gypsum is preferably concentrated in low organic matter content samples. Mineral crusts containing a MgAl silicate phase, epsomite, halite and gypsum are precipitated on the floating algal mats covering the wetland waters. Floating algal mats deposit increased the organic matter content of the upper sediments which promoted the presence of fermentative microorganisms, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) communities and variations of Eh that influence the authigenesis of carbonate and S-bearing minerals. Replacement of poorly crystalline MgSi phases infilling algal cells by aragonite was favored in the organic matter rich sediments with low Eh values and important SRB communities that promoted sulfate bioreduction processes to form pyrite. Aragonite precipitation was favored by the increase of carbonate and bicarbonate concentration produced by the SRB oxidation of organic matter, the CO2 degassing by high summer temperatures and the CO2 uptake by photosynthesis of the algal mats.

Spatial variation and biovectoring of metals in gull faeces	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												We assessed the spatial variation in concentrations of ten metals in faeces of the lesser black-backed gull (LBBG) Larus fuscus wintering at seven localities in South-West Spain. We found high concentrations of metals in gull faeces, with several elements (As, Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn) locally exceeding (by 2 to 11 times) derived Lowest Effect Level (LEL) values. We also found strong spatial variation, related to the main pollution sources associated with the different sites. Faeces from Chipiona Port (Gulf of C?adiz) showed the highest levels of As; Cetina saltpans (Bay of C?adiz) ranked first for Pb, Zn and Mo, which was consistent with historic mining and industrial pollution; Don?ana ricefields showed the highest levels of Mn, a highly available element in flooded areas; while landfills ranked first for Cd, Co, Cr, Cu and Ni, potentially associated with electronic waste. Furthermore, we demonstrate how faecal analysis can be used to quantify biovectoring of metals into specific localities, using LBBG movement ecology and census data. At Fuente de Piedra, a shallow, closed-basin lake important for waterbirds, we show that metal inputs by LBBG have increased in recent years, and long-term deposition (e.g., of Pb) may impact aquatic communities and ecological processes in this Ramsar site.

We sampled three transects on four consecutive days and nights in April, July, and October to enable us to characterize threadfin shad on both daily and seasonal time scales. We used a patch recognition algorithm to analyze echo-integrated hydroacoustic data in order to define patches and related patch characteristics (numbers, density, area, and mean depth). Threadfin shad in Lake Norman were patchily distributed and exhibited strong, generally consistent patterns in patch number, fish density, size, and depth. During most surveys we observed 12-16 patches/km with fish densities exceeding twice the average background density, and 1-2 patches/km with fish densities 50 times the average background density. Most patches were small (<50-100 m(2) in the vertical plane); less than 10% of the area contained 50% of the fish. In October night surveys, patches tended to be larger and less numerous and to have lower fish densities than at other times. Depth distribution of patches varied among seasons and was influenced by temperature, by oxygen concentration, and possibly by vertical distribution of predators and prey. Temporal changes in patch distribution suggested that fish composing the patches were highly mobile, spatially integrating threadfin shad impacts on their zooplankton prey. Large differences in day and night average density estimates in October suggested strong diel habitat shifts by threadfin shad during fall.																			0002-8487					NOV	1995	124	6					804	812		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0804:SATDOT>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0804:SATDOT>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995TF91800002

Egg-hatching synchrony was pronounced during summer, when 73-93% of eggs hatched during a 6-7 h period. Reproductive synchrony was evident before the egg development stage and may have arisen during oogenesis in response to diel changes in lake temperature. Vertical migration was generally upward at night and downward during the day. These movements differed in timing for ovigerous and nonovigerous females. Ovigerous animals reached their lowest and highest positions in the water column about 4 and 6 h later than nonovigerous animals. This differential migration produced diel changes in the depth profile of egg ratio. These findings of egg-hatching synchrony and vertical migration have important implications for studies of zooplankton population dynamics. In the 2 yr of this study, sampling at different times of day produced daily variations in egg ratios and calculated instantaneous birth rates that approached an order of magnitude.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1983	28	5					957	969		10.4319/lo.1983.28.5.0957	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1983.28.5.0957													WOS:A1983RN42600013

Groundwater discharges are displayed as an important source of phosphorous to a lake due to: (1) high concentrations in the aquifer just below the lake, and (2) the main flow paths through the aquifer-lakebed interface either being overland flow through a seepage face, or focused in zones with very high discharge rates. In-lake springs have measured discharge of up to 7.45 m(3) per m(2) of lakebed per day. These findings were based on seepage meter measurements at 18 locations, stable isotope (delta O-18) analyses, temperature profiles and mapping of ice cover distribution. Groundwater-lake interaction was modelled with a 2D conceptual flow model (MODFLOW) with hydrogeology interpreted from catchment multi electrode profiling, on-lake ground-penetrating radar, well logging and borehole data. Discharge was found to be much focused and opposite to expected increase away from the shoreline. The average total phosphorus concentration in discharging groundwater sampled just beneath the lakebed was 0.162 mg TP/l and thereby well over freshwater ecological thresholds (0.043-0.612, median = 0.117 mg TP/l). The study illustrates a direct link between groundwater and lake chemistry.					; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Sondergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Karan, Sachin/G-9214-2018; Kidmose, Jacob/M-3556-2018	Frandsen, Mette/0000-0002-3350-1392; Nilsson, Bertel/0000-0002-6707-8764; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Sondergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Karan, Sachin/0000-0002-0058-1584; Kidmose, Jacob/0000-0001-8577-2197													1431-2174	1435-0157				DEC	2013	21	8					1787	1802		10.1007/s10040-013-1043-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-013-1043-7													WOS:000327391000009

The 70 strains fell into five groups: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria. Bacterial diversity at the phylum level detected in Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles comprised Proteobacteria (including the subphyla Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Deltaproteobacteria), Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chlorobi, and Deinococcus-Thermus. Gammaproteobacteria was identified to be the dominant bacterial subphylum by cultivation and DGGE method. By cluster analysis, the overall structure and composition of bacterial communities in the soil and lacustrine sediment were similar to one another but significantly different from bacterial communities in penguin ornithogenic sediment and marine sediment, which were similar to one another. The majority of 16S rDNA sequences from cultured bacteria were closely related to sequences found in cold environments. In contrast, a minority of 16S rDNA sequences from the DGGE approach were closely related to sequences found in cold environments.

Phosphorus forms in urban and agricultural runoff: Implications for management of Danish Lake Nordborg	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Egemose, S. and H. S. Jensen. 2009. Phosphorus forms in urban and agricultural runoff: Implications for management of Danish Lake Nordborg. Lake Reserv. Manage. 25:410-418. The catchment of eutrophic Lake Nordborg, Denmark, consists of 25% urban areas with separate sewer systems and 63% agricultural areas with clayey soil and grain crops. Diffuse runoff is the only external phosphorus (P) source (similar to 550 kg/yr), but the lake suffers from high internal loading (similar to 1300 kg/yr). In-lake aluminum treatment is suggested if external P-loading can be brought down by similar to 30% to an annual average inlet concentration of <0.100 mg/L. We examined the share and bioavailability of particulate P (PP) in 14 tributaries during a winter season to evaluate if the reduction in bioavailable P-load can be obtained by construction of precipitation/retention ponds in major inlets. One-third of the P-load occurred as PP, independent of catchment type. For urban runoff, 62% of PP was surface adsorbed P, iron-bound P, and extractable organic P, all of which may be considered bioavailable. The corresponding value for agricultural tributaries was 76%. For both types of catchments more than 70% of total P (PP and dissolved P) was bioavailable, but total concentrations were much higher (0.174 +/- 0.032 mg/L) in agricultural runoff than in urban runoff (0.082 +/- 0.019 mg/L). Measurements of PP settling velocity revealed that similar to 30% settled slower than 1 cm/h whereas similar to 50% settled faster than 1 m/h. Therefore, water retention time in precipitation ponds to Lake Nordborg should exceed 8 h to reach the target reduction in P-load. Focus should be on the agricultural catchment that contributes 140 kg to PP load, rather than the urban catchment that only contributes 48 kg.

Spread and distribution pattern of Sinanodonta woodiana in Lake Balaton	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												The exotic Chinese pond mussel (Sinanodonta woodiana) is the biggest bivalve in Europe, it was first reported from Lake Balaton in 2006. In 2011 summer relative abundance and biomass of S. woodiana and native unionids were recorded at 21 sampling sites, in order to analyse the speed of dispersion of the Chinese pond mussel and to reveal its possible ecological impacts on native unionids. GPS coordinates of the sampling sites were recorded, spatial distribution of the data shows that high abundances and biomass are characteristic along the northern shore of the lake. In the western part of the lake, in the Keszthely Basin, its biomass may amount to as much as 50-80% of the total unionid biomass. In this basin, comparing these data to the distribution of unionids measured in 1992/93, the impact of S. woodiana seems high, as A. cygnea has been replaced by S. woodiana and the ratio of A. anatina reduced from 17.8% to 8.6%. Taking into consideration that S. woodiana has so rapidly developed high relative abundance and biomass close to the supposed source of introduction and it has a high spread potential in the lake, future increase in population size (and dominance) can be expected.

To examine the horizontal water flow between Hamana and Inohana Lakes while monitoring horizontal and vertical exchanges of water within the lake, we determined the current velocity, salinity, and water density in the field. We performed regression analysis of the relationship between meteorological factors such as wind and rain and the horizontal water flow between the two lakes. This information was then used to construct a simple box model to estimate the average water exchange and evaluate the meteorological effect based on the average salinity and river discharge. These results revealed that the surface water-volume flux in the channel was heavily influenced by the north-south wind intensity. These findings indicate that a box model is capable of providing a good estimate of the summer-averaged water flow and the exchange rate that is influenced by wind and rain.																			1559-2723	1559-2731				JAN	2009	32	1					88	99		10.1007/s12237-008-9118-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-008-9118-8													WOS:000262504600007

Regional patterns and climatic predictors of viruses in honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies over time	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Honey bee viruses are serious pathogens that can cause poor colony health and productivity. We analyzed a multi-year longitudinal dataset of abundances of nine honey bee viruses (deformed wing virus A, deformed wing virus B, black queen cell virus, sacbrood virus, Lake Sinai virus, Kashmir bee virus, acute bee paralysis virus, chronic bee paralysis virus, and Israeli acute paralysis virus) in colonies located across Canada to describe broad trends in virus intensity and occurrence among regions and years. We also tested climatic variables (temperature, wind speed, and precipitation) as predictors in an effort to understand possible drivers underlying seasonal patterns in viral prevalence. Temperature was a significant positive predictor of the total number of viruses per sample, which was highest in British Columbia (mean = 5.0). Lake Sinai virus (LSV) was the most prevalent overall (at 89%) and had the highest infection intensity, at an average of 3.9 x 108 copies per bee. Acute bee paralysis virus was the least prevalent virus (at 4.7%) and had the lowest infection intensity (1.9 x 105 copies per bee). Surprisingly, including Varroa abundance as a covariate did not significantly improve model fit for any virus. All viruses, except Kashmir bee virus, varied by region, and one or more climatic variables were significant predictors for six of the nine viruses. Although climatic effects were often inconsistent among individual viruses, we show that climatic variables can be better predictors of virus intensity and occurrence than Varroa mite abundance, at least when infestation rates are low.

J	Ulrich, KL; Tallman, RF				Ulrich, Kendra Lyn; Tallman, Ross F.			The Capelin invasion: evidence for a trophic shift in Arctic Char populations from the Cumberland Sound region, Nunavut, Canada	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Climate change is having myriad effects on Arctic marine ecosystems and food webs. Anadromous Arctic Char, Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758), feed intensively at sea during summer. In Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada, there has been a recent increased availability of a forage fish, Capelin. To investigate changes over time in Arctic Char foraging, we assessed Arctic Char trophic niche from 2002 to 2011 using stomach content analysis and stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of muscle tissue from two river/lake systems, Isuituq and Kipisa. We also compared population characteristics by calculating Fulton's condition factor (K) and by fitting von Bertalanffy growth curves with length-at-age data. Results revealed Capelin were newly present in the diets of Arctic Char in 2011, describing a shift from a primarily invertebrate-based to a fish-based diet. No trend in delta N-15 over time suggests that the trophic level of Arctic Char has not changed; however, the delta C-15 for both systems converged in 2011 on a value suggestive of feeding on Capelin. Growth curves and length-at-age analyses suggest that foraging on Capelin may have increased individual growth. Changes in the growth and condition of Arctic Char in this region could have significant economic and cultural implications.																				2368-7460				JUN	2021	7	2			SI		413	435		10.1139/as-2020-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2020-0001													WOS:000672826800004

We outline a simple method for estimating the in-situ settling velocity of particles in wind disturbed lakes. The total sedimentation rate (primary and secondary sedimentation) was measured during storm events in two lakes using a time series sediment trap. 2. The sediment trap had 12 sample bottles which were programmed to open for periods of 3-4 h, giving total deployment times ranging from 36 to 48 h. 3. Wave mixed layer theory was used to infer if and when sediment resuspension occurred and the first order rate equation was used to estimate the settling velocity of resuspended particles. 4. The settling velocity during three resuspension events in Lough Neagh and one in Lough Macnean were 34.3, 29.5, 24.1 and 77.3 m day(-1), respectively. These are similar to values obtained using recent in-situ video imaging in marine environments, but much larger than previous lake sediment trap studies.						douglas, richard/0000-0001-8156-0920													0046-5070					MAR	2003	48	3					512	518		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01027.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01027.x													WOS:000181027400012

An Improved Method for Extracting, Sorting, and AMS Dating of Pollen Concentrates From Lake Sediment	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												High-resolution chronologies are crucial for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, and are particularly challenging for lacustrine records of terrestrial paleoclimate. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon measurement of terrestrial macrofossils is the most common technique for building age models for lake sediment cores, but relies on the presence of terrestrial macrofossils in sediments. In the absence of sufficient macrofossils, pollen concentrates represent a valuable source of dates for building high-resolution chronologies. However, pollen isolation and dating may present several challenges, as has been reported by different authors in previous work over the last few decades. Here we present an improved method for extracting, purifying and radiocarbon-dating pollen concentrates using flow cytometry to improve the extraction efficiency and the purity of the pollen concentrates. Overall, the nature of the sediments and the abundance of the pollen represent major considerations in obtaining enough pollen grains and, consequently, enough carbon to be dated. Further, the complete separation of pollen from other forms of organic matter is required to ensure the accuracy of the dates. We apply the method to surface samples and sediment cores recovered from two contrasting lake basins on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada (California), and describe the variations that may be used to optimize pollen preparation from a variety of sediments.					; Zimmerman, Susan/A-3351-2013	Zimmerman, Susan/0000-0002-1320-1878; 													2296-701X					MAY 25	2021	9								668676	10.3389/fevo.2021.668676	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.668676													WOS:000658674300001

Climate change may also affect the mobilisation of natural metal sources, with potential ecological consequences beyond mountains' geographical limits; however, this question has remained largely unexplored. We investigated this by analysing a number of key climatic factors in relationship with trace metal accumulation in the sediment core of a Pyrenean lake. The sediment metal contents showed increasing accumulation trend over time, and their levels varied in step with recent climate change. The findings further revealed that a rise in the elevation of freezing level, a general increase in the frequency of drier periods, changes in the frequency of winter freezing days and a reducing snow cover since the early 1980s, together are responsible for the observed variability and augmented accumulation of trace metals. Our results provide clear evidence of increased mobilisation of natural metal sources - an overlooked effect of climate change on the environment. With further alterations in climate equilibrium predicted over the ensuing decades, it is likely that mountain catchments in metamorphic areas may become significant sources of trace metals, with potentially harmful consequences for the wider environment.

Using diatoms to track road-salt seepage into small, shallow, softwater Ontario lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Since the 1950s, the widespread application of road salt for winter road maintenance and safety in cold regions has led to increased conductivity levels in many freshwater systems. Salting practices have adversely affected freshwater biota; however, the magnitude of ecological impacts may vary by species and ecosystem. Here, we examine diatom assemblage changes during the past similar to 200 years from the sedimentary records of five impacted lakes (measured specific conductance values of 149-350 mu S center dot cm(-1)) and a reference lake (18 mu S center dot cm(-1)) located in the Muskoka River Watershed, south-central Ontario, Canada. Diatom compositional changes in the road-salt-impacted sites were consistent with increasing conductivity and increased diatom-inferred (DI)-conductivity was evident during the latter half of the 20th century in the impacted lakes, concurrent with known road-salt application. The strongest predictor of DI-conductivity changes among the six lakes was the kilometre equivalents of roads within the watershed (i.e., kilometres of road x number of lanes). Similar to changes observed in a previous study focusing on cladoceran assemblages, we conclude that even modest applications of road salt can affect diatom assemblages in softwater lakes.

Impact of stocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) on habitat use by the wild population	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We investigated the summer habitat occupied by populations of young-of-the-year wild and stocked (farmed populations released into the native range) Atlantic salmon under allopatric and sympatric conditions. Under allopatric conditions, farmed and wild salmon occupied habitats with the same characteristics. The salmon preferentially occupied the riffle areas. However, under sympatric conditions, the fish occupied meso- and micro-habitats with different characteristics. Wild salmon avoided habitats used by farmed salmon and preferred glide areas with considerable vegetation cover. This study suggests that differences in the pattern of habitats used by young Atlantic salmon were both size- and origin-dependent and may result from intra-species competition between farmed and wild populations. Given that stocking with farmed Atlantic salmon is carried out intensively to enhance recreational angling or to conserve salmon populations, this study warns that this can have a negative impact on the extant wild Atlantic salmon population.

Holocene climate changes in tropical Australasia based on branched tetraether lipid evidence from Girraween Lagoon, northern Australia	CATENA												Understanding Holocene natural variability of the climate system is crucial for accurate evaluation of the temporal course of current anthropogenic warming and forecasting future climate trends. However, the patterns and mechanisms of Holocene climate variability in tropical Australasia remain highly controversial, partly due to proxy uncertainties and methodological limitations. In this study, we analyze distributions of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) in the sediments of Girraween Lagoon from northern Australia to investigate the temperature and hydroclimate changes spanning the past 10.4 +/- 0.1 kyr. Our reconstructed Holocene mean annual air temperature using the tropical lake-specific brGDGT calibration displays a long-term warming trend with amplitude of 2 degrees C. This overall warming pattern is generally consistent with other brGDGTbased terrestrial temperatures, alkenone-derived sea surface temperatures from the tropical Australasia and model simulations, but not with those inferred from planktonic foraminiferal Mg/Ca paleothermometers. The reconstructed pH values suggest a significant acidification process in Girraween Lagoon during the Holocene, which mainly results from a reduction in the input of alkaline waters from the underlying carbonate sinkhole regulated by hydroclimate change in northern Australia, but also an enhancement of acid production from sedimentary organic matter. Combined with other proxy records, we suggest that changes in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation have played an important role in the transition from a cool and wet to a warmer and seasonal drier climate in tropical Australasia over the Holocene. The dual reconstruction of temperature and pH provides a holistic perspective on the possible forcing mechanisms of Holocene hydroclimate in tropical Australasia.					sun, weiwei/GQA-5041-2022; Rowe, Cassandra/M-6009-2015; Bird, Michael/G-5364-2010	Bird, Michael/0000-0003-1801-8703													0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2025	256								109124	10.1016/j.catena.2025.109124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2025.109124		MAY 2025											WOS:001490770600001

In the heart of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, Dal Lake, has witnessed extreme loss in water quality during the last four decades because of anthropogenic pressures. The lake is unique in that over 50,000 people inhabit the lake itself in houseboats, dongas, or islands within the lake. These people derive their livelihood from the lake in terms of tourism, agriculture, fishing, and vegetable farming. The countless ways people use the lake have led to an extreme load of pollution in the lake. Encroachment in and around the lake has led to the loss of volume of water in the lake and consequently increased the concentration of pollutants. Discharge of untreated sewage, agricultural runoff, and sediments from adjoining catchments have further degraded the lake water quality. The changes in water quality are clear from the physio-chemical properties of the lake waters. While transparency and dissolved oxygen in the lake have decreased drastically during the last 40 years, the concentration of harmful substances like phosphates, nitrates, and chlorides has increased. The hardness of water has also increased due to higher levels of carbonates and bicarbonates in the lake. This paper details the changes in the water quality of Dal Lake over the recent past. The paper analyses the strategies that can be implemented to manage the lake and restore its quality if appropriately implemented.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2022	194	3							228	10.1007/s10661-022-09869-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09869-x								35220504					WOS:000761329300001

Water of these two lakes mostly comes from the middle and eastern parts of the Qilian Mountains. Previous studies show that the Holocene climate changes of the two lakes implied from lake records are different. Whether lake evaporation plays a role in asynchronous Holocene climate changes is important to understand the lake records. In this paper, we used modern observations beside Qinghai Lake and Zhuye Lake to test the impact factors for lake evaporation. Pan evaporation near the two lakes is mainly related to relative humidity, temperature, vapor pressure and sunshine duration. But temperature has different impacts to lake evaporation of the two lakes, which can affect Holocene millennial-scale lake level changes. In addition, differences in relative humidity on the millennial-scale would be more significant, which also can contribute to asynchronous lake records.

The paper considers the current state of the zooplankton community in six reservoirs of the Chelyabinsk region (Russia). The species composition (32 species) and quantitative characteristics of the zooplankton community of reservoirs in summers of 2016 and 2017 were studied. The species common to all reservoirs belong to widespread palearct or cosmopolitan. It is studied the ratio of major groups. The results of the study showed that the share of Cladocera in mesotrophic reservoirs is 2.5 times higher than in eutrophic reservoirs. Unlike Cladocera, the Rotifera group is 10 times more abundant in eutrophic reservoirs compared to mesotrophic ones. Copepoda were common to all bodies of water, as they belong to widespread Palearctic or cosmopolitan. Changes in species diversity were recorded depending on the eutrophication of the reservoir. The increased anthropogenic load influenced the decrease in both the composition and the structure of zooplankton communities in water bodies.																			1755-1307						2019	344								012013	10.1088/1755-1315/344/1/012013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/344/1/012013													WOS:000562941100013

In the course of reisolation of the known aeruginosins KT608A and KT608B for bioassay studies, we noticed the presence of some unknown anabaenopeptins in the extract of a Microcystis cell mass collected during the 2016 spring bloom event in Lake Kinneret, Israel. The H-1 NMR spectra of some of these compounds presented a significant difference in the appearance of the ureido bridge protons, and their molecular masses did not match any one of the 152 known anabaenopeptins. Analyses of the 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, and MS/MS spectra of the new compounds revealed their structures as the hydantoin derivatives of anabaenopeptins A, B, F, and (1)[Dht]-anabaenopeptin A and oscillamide Y (1, 2, 3, 6, and 4, respectively) and a new anabaenopeptin, (1)[Dht]-anabaenopeptin A (5).

The Effect of Largemouth Bass Virus on Bass Populations in Kansas Impoundments	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Largemouth Bass virus (LMBV) first became a concern in Kansas when it was identified as a potential cause of decreased catch rates at Crawford State Fishing Lake in 2007. The discovery of LMBV in eight additional impoundments from 2008 to 2017 increased concern about the prevalence and effects of LMBV in Kansas. In response, the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks, and Tourism tested 25 Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides impoundments for the presence of LMBV. The objectives of this study were to quantify the incidence of LMBV and examine differences in population metrics (i.e., body condition, relative abundance, and growth). A total of 1,260 Largemouth Bass were collected by using standard spring electrofishing surveys, and sagittal otoliths were collected from all of the sampled fish to estimate growth rates. Of the 25 study impoundments, 14 tested positive for LMBV. There was no evidence of LMBV effects on body condition, relative abundance of quality-length fish, or growth rates. The initial dates of LMBV infection of Largemouth Bass in these impoundments are unknown. The LMBV-positive populations in Kansas may have been exposed to the virus many years ago, and the fish may be in the process of rebounding from any potential negative effects.

Visual Sensitivity of Deepwater Fishes in Lake Superior	PLOS ONE												The predator-prey interactions in the offshore food web of Lake Superior have been well documented, but the sensory systems mediating these interactions remain unknown. The deepwater sculpin, (Myoxocephalus thompsoni), siscowet (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet), and kiyi (Coregonus kiyi) inhabit low light level environments. To investigate the potential role of vision in predator-prey interactions, electroretinography was used to determine visual sensitivity for each species. Spectral sensitivity curves revealed peak sensitivity at 525 nm for each species which closely corresponds to the prevalent downwelling light spectrum at depth. To determine if sufficient light was available to mediate predator-prey interactions, visual sensitivity was correlated with the intensity of downwelling light in Lake Superior to construct visual depth profiles for each species. Sufficient daytime irradiance exists for visual interactions to approximately 325 m for siscowet and kiyi and 355 m for the deepwater sculpin during summer months. Under full moon conditions, sufficient irradiance exists to elicit ERG response to light available at approximately 30 m for the siscowet and kiyi and 45 m for the deepwater sculpin. Visual interactions are therefore possible at the depths and times when these organisms overlap in the water column indicating that vision may play a far greater role at depth in deep freshwater lakes than had been previously documented.

Whole-lake experiments reveal the fate of terrestrial particulate organic carbon in benthic food webs of shallow lakes	ECOLOGY												Lake ecosystems are strongly linked to their terrestrial surroundings by material and energy fluxes across ecosystem boundaries. However, the contribution of terrestrial particulate organic carbon (tPOC) from annual leaf fall to lake food webs has not yet been adequately traced and quantified. In this study, we conducted whole-lake experiments to trace artificially added tPOC through the food webs of two shallow lakes of similar eutrophic status, but featuring alternative stable regimes (macrophyte rich vs. phytoplankton dominated). Lakes were divided with a curtain, and maize (Zea mays) leaves were added, as an isotopically distinct tPOC source, into one half of each lake. To estimate the balance between autochthonous carbon fixation and allochthonous carbon input, primary production and tPOC and tDOC (terrestrial dissolved organic carbon) influx were calculated for the treatment sides. We measured the stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta C-13) of about 800 samples from all trophic consumer levels and compared them between lake sides, lakes, and three seasons. Leaf litter bag experiments showed that added maize leaves were processed at rates similar to those observed for leaves from shoreline plants, supporting the suitability of maize leaves as a tracer. The lake-wide carbon influx estimates confirmed that autochthonous carbon fixation by primary production was the dominant carbon source for consumers in the lakes. Nevertheless, carbon isotope values of benthic macroinvertebrates were significantly higher with maize additions compared to the reference side of each lake. Carbon isotope values of omnivorous and piscivorous fish were significantly affected by maize additions only in the macrophyte-dominated lake and delta C-13 of zooplankton and planktivorous fish remained unaffected in both lakes. In summary, our results experimentally demonstrate that tPOC in form of autumnal litterfall is rapidly processed during the subsequent months in the food web of shallow lakes and is channeled to secondary and tertiary consumers predominantly via the benthic pathways. A more intense processing of tPOC seems to be connected to a higher structural complexity in littoral zones, and hence may differ between shallow lakes of alternative stable states.					; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023; Mehner, Thomas/B-8665-2008; Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014; Brauns, Mario/M-7878-2014; Brothers, Soren/AAE-9584-2019	Kohler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; Mehner, Thomas/0000-0002-3619-165X; Brauns, Mario/0000-0002-5012-9721; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				JUN	2014	95	6					1496	1505		10.1890/13-0390.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0390.1								25039215					WOS:000337218500009
J	HERDENDORF, CE				HERDENDORF, CE			LAKE ERIE COASTAL WETLANDS - AN OVERVIEW	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Coastal wetlands of Lake Erie fall into three categories, depending on the type of protection available to the wetland vegetation: (1) coastal lagoons behind barrier beaches, (2) managed marshes protected by earthern and rip-rap dikes, and (3) estuarine tributary mouths. At one time the most important protection was that afforded by barrier bars or other natural shoreline features which formed quiet lagoons and embayments. Very few natural wetlands of this type still exist in Lake Erie. Most of the lagoon-type coastal marshes, if they have not been drained or filled or engulfed by the lake, have been replaced by the second type: managed-waterfowl marshes which are now protected by earthen rip-rap dikes. The third type of protection is the natural isolation from lake storms provided by the estuaries of virtually all of the tributaries entering Lake Erie, particularly at the western end. Large wetlands have developed along most of the estuaries where disturbance has been minimal. Estuarine coastal marshes currently form the majority of the naturally protected wetlands bordering western Lake Erie.																			0380-1330						1992	18	4					533	551		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71321-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71321-5													WOS:A1992KJ74600005

M.			Predicting bioavailability of sediment-associated organic contaminants for Diporeia spp. and Oligochaetes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) were calculated for Diporeia spp. and oligochaete worms exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from field-collected sediment. These data were compared to the contaminant fraction extracted from sediment with Tenax resin using a 24 h extraction. A previous laboratory study suggested a linear relationship between log BSAF and the contaminant fraction rapidly desorbed from sediment. However, the BSAF data in our study did not fit this relationship. Better predictive regressions for both PCBs and PAHs were found when the log of the lipid-normalized organism contaminant concentrations were plotted against the log of the Tenax-extracted organic carbon-normalized sediment contaminant concentration. Regression lines for the two species had the same slope, but the Diporeia intercept was 2.3 times larger. When adjusted for a 6 h Tenax extraction, based on a regression between 6 and 24 h Tenax extractions, data from this study and two other studies that included multiple oligochaete species fit a single predictive regression. The exception included some PAHs that fell below the regression line. Thus, a single relationship generally predicted bioaccumulation across sediments, compound classes, oligochaete species, and among laboratories.

J	Tapia-Hernández, E; García-Carrera, S				Tapia-Hernandez, Edgar; Garcia-Carrera, Salvador			Inelastic response of ductile eccentrically braced frames	JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING												Results: of nonlinear analyses of 6- and 9-story regular buildings structured with moment-resisting eccentrically braced steel frames are discussed in this paper. Models were located in soft soil site conditions (Mexico City's lake-bed zone) and designed for a seismic modification factor Q = 4.0 (the maximum allowed according to the local code). Nonlinear analyses were performed in OpenSees. Beam-column elements with plasticity spread along the element length were considered for the link beam, beam segments outside of shear links, braces, and columns. A detailed model of the connection at ends of link elements with springs was also considered. Through 1756 certified laboratory coupon tests, an improved value of the actual steel yielding stress was included in order to evaluate material overstrength capacity based on local market characteristics. Despite the fact that buildings were designed in compliance with capacity design principles, undesired soft-story collapse mechanisms were developed. According to the results, the link rotation normative limit is conservative to predict actual inelastic capacities. Based on a statistical study, a proposal to evaluate link rotation capacity was developed as a function of the cross-section of the link beam. Results indicate that links do not yield at the same time or on all floors; therefore, axial demands in columns based on a capacity design philosophy might be too conservative. An improved strategy to estimate the axial design demand in columns is proposed.

J	KELLAR, PE; PAERL, HW				KELLAR, PE; PAERL, HW			PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS DURING AN N2-FIXING ANABAENA BLOOM	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												A. spiroides has the ability to maintain intense biomass production for extensive periods in the epilimnion of a small eutrophic lake characterized by conditions that cause photooxidative death in a number of other phytoplankton. By the enhancement of carotenoid synthesis, chlorophyll a was protected from photooxidation and prevented from catalyzing other photooxidative reactions within the cells. By temporally separating CO2 and N2 fixation, maximum utilization of photosynthetically active radiation was achieved. Because CO2 fixation was more sensitive than N2 fixation to a high O2 concentration, the former was maximized during morning hours, before the afternoon buildup of dissolved O2. The diurnal partitioning of C and N2 fixation has 2 additional advantages; possible competition for reductant-generating compounds is minimized, and adequate endogenous pools of C skeletons are assured to accept newly fixed NH3. Anabaena, far from undergoing photooxidative death, may utilize a physiological strategy which allows optimization of radiant energy use for reductive processes and dominance of surface waters and shading of deeper phytoplankton during summer blooms.

The solubilities and densities of the euqilibrated solution were determined. According to the experimental data, the metastable phase diagram, the wate-content diagram, density diagram, and pH value diagram were plotted. This quaternary system is of a complex type; the double salt KLiSO4 was found at the studied temperature. The metastable phase diagram consists of three invariant points seven univariant curves, and five salt crystallization regions. Potassium sulfate has the largest crystallization field and can be easily separated from the solution in this system at 273.15 K using an evaporation method. Comparisons between the metastable and the stable phase diagram at different temperatures show that the crystallization forms of the salts are the same , whereas the crystallization field of salt K2SO4 becomes obviously larger with the temperature decrease. If more pure potassium sulfate needs to be separated as much as possible, a fall in temperature is necessary.

Djankuat glacier station in the North Caucasus, Russia: a database of glaciological, hydrological, and meteorological observations and stable isotope sampling results during 2007-2017	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												This study presents a dataset on long-term multidisciplinary glaciological, hydrological, and meteorological observations and isotope sampling in a sparsely monitored alpine zone of the North Caucasus in the Djankuat research basin. The Djankuat glacier, which is the largest in the basin, was chosen as representative of the central North Caucasus during the International Hydrological Decade and is one of 30 "reference" glaciers in the world that have annual mass balance series longer than 50 years (Zemp et al., 2009). The dataset features a comprehensive set of observations from 2007 to 2017 and contains yearly - measurements of snow depth and density; - measurements of dynamics of snow and ice melting; - measurements of water runoff, conductivity, turbidity, temperature, delta O-18, delta D at the main gauging station (844 samples in total) with an hourly or sub-daily time step depending on the parameter; - data on delta O-18 and delta H-2 sampling of liquid precipitation, snow, ice, firn, and groundwater in different parts of the watershed taken regularly during melting season (485 samples in total); - measurements of precipitation amount, air temperature, relative humidity, shortwave incoming and reflected radiation, longwave downward and upward radiation, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed and direction measured at several automatic weather stations within the basin with 15 min to 1 h time steps; - gradient meteorological measurements to estimate turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture, measuring three components of wind speed at a frequency of 10 Hz to estimate the impulse of turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat over the glacier surface by the eddy covariance method. Data were collected during the ablation period (June-September). The observations were halted in winter. The dataset is available from PANGAEA (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.894807, Rets et al., 2018a) and will be further updated. The dataset can be useful for developing and verifying hydrological, glaciological, and meteorological models for alpine areas, to study the impact of climate change on hydrology of mountain regions using isotopic and hydrochemical approaches in hydrology. As the dataset includes the measurements of hydrometeorological and glaciological variables during the catastrophic proglacial lake outburst in the neighboring Bashkara valley in September 2017, it is a valuable contribution to study lake outbursts.					; Veres, Arina/HJY-8317-2023; Frolova, Natalia/AAT-2671-2020; Полюхов, Алексей/AAC-4342-2019; Toropov, Pavel/O-1903-2013; Pavlyukevich, Ekaterina/ABG-1851-2020; Tokarev, Igor/ADR-9438-2022; Chizhova, Julia N./M-4440-2015; Kireeva, Maria/B-2482-2014; Aleshina, Maria/W-5174-2019; Rets, Ekaterina/V-9742-2017; Smirnov, Andrey/AAG-7948-2021; Tsyplenkov, Anatolii/O-9599-2017; Chizhova, Julia/M-4440-2015; Ekaykin, Alexey/K-9894-2015; Chalov, Sergey/K-1847-2012; Vasil'chuk, Yurij/C-9124-2015	Aleshina, Maria/0000-0001-8416-7657; Smirnov, Andrey/0000-0002-2165-3049; Poliukhov, Aleksei/0000-0001-6336-3376; Tokarev, Igor Vladimirovich/0000-0003-1095-0731; Chizhova, Julia N./0000-0003-0539-5796; Kireeva, Maria/0000-0002-8285-9761; Rets, Ekaterina/0000-0002-4505-1173; Tsyplenkov, Anatolii/0000-0003-4144-8402; Kornilova, Ekaterina/0000-0002-8416-5843; Ekaykin, Alexey/0000-0001-9819-2802; Chalov, Sergey/0000-0002-6937-7020; Pavel, Toropov/0000-0003-0922-1486; Vasil'chuk, Yurij/0000-0001-5847-5568													1866-3508	1866-3516				SEP 30	2019	11	3					1463	1481		10.5194/essd-11-1463-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-1463-2019													WOS:000508193100001

Twenty-two seismic profiles (18 km total) and eight sediment cores taken from the lake margin to its depocenter at 13.5 m provide evidence for low lake stands during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Thirty-one AMS radiocarbon dates of macrofossils and pollen provide a century-scale chronology. Prior to 12,700 C-14 yr B.P., the lake, which now overhows, was either seasonally dry or desiccated for prolonged periods, indicating a severe period of aridity. Lake level rose more than Is m between 12,700 and 12,200 C-14 yr B.P, before falling to 17 m below the level of overflow. Between 11,600 and 10,600 C-14 yr E.P. the water remained between 14 and 17 m below the overflow level. Onlap sedimentary sequences were formed during a transgression phase between 10,600 and 10,000 C-14: yr B.P, Between 10,000 and about 8800 C-14 yr B,P, the lake was between 6 and 9 m below the overflow level. Lake level again rose, approaching the overflow level, between 8800 and 8000 C-14 yr B.P. Seismic and core evidence of minor erosional events suggest lowstands of 2-6 m until 4800 C-14 yr B.P, There have been no prolonged periods of lake-level depression since that time. The major restructuring of the climate system during deglaciation evidently generated a complex set of fluctuations in effective moisture in interior Alaska, which likely affected eolian processes and vegetation development, as well as lake levels.

J	Toney, JL; Leavitt, PR; Huang, YS				Toney, Jaime L.; Leavitt, Peter R.; Huang, Yongsong			Alkenones are common in prairie lakes of interior Canada	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Long chain alkenone (LCA) lipids produced by haptophyte algae are ubiquitous in marine environments and are increasingly reported from enhanced conductivity, solute rich lakes worldwide. Following our survey of lakes in the United States (Toney et al., 10.1016/j.gca.2009.11.021), we examined surface sediments from 19 lakes in central Canada for alkenones and compared our data with lake characteristics. We found that 68% of surveyed lakes contained sedimentary LCAs, all have C-37:4me dominated profiles. Lakes containing LCAs had salinities > 1.5 g/l and SO4/CO3 ratios > 3.5. LCA concentrations were highly elevated (Sigma C-37 > 500 mu g/g sediment) in sediments of meromictic lakes with permanently anoxic deep waters. Overall, the distribution of LCAs was consistent with a previous survey of lakes in the interior of the United States demonstrating that tetra-unsaturated lipids were most common in sulfate rich, saline lakes. Alkenone unsaturation indices (U-37(K)) from the upper 10 cm of the sediment column are weakly correlated with point sampled average spring water temperature (r(2) = 0.30, p = 0.067) and the range of inferred temperatures is in agreement with the average, long term potential evapotranspiration weighted temperature.

Of the 32 cyst types occurring at least once with a minimum of > 1%, six were related to chrysophyte taxa so far. Nine cyst types were described as new to science. Aiming to define ecological preferences, we compared the cyst stratigraphy with pollen and diatom stratigraphies, diatom-inferred total phosphorus (Di-TP) and diatom-inferred mean summer epilimnetic water temperatures (Di-SEWT). Two significant cyst zones corresponded with the two main pollen zones (Betula followed by Pinus), and a change from meso-eutrophic (dominance of Cyclotella ocellata) to oligotrophic conditions (C. comensis dominance). Secondary changes in cyst assemblages may have been triggered by climate fluctuations. In sum, we classified three groups of cyst types: (1) cysts related to meso-eutrophic conditions; (2) cysts related to oligotrophic conditions and/or cold water; (3) cysts with unknown ecological preferences.																			0029-5035					AUG	2009	89	1-2					245	261		10.1127/0029-5035/2009/0089-0245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0029-5035/2009/0089-0245													WOS:000268616100014

Field Estimation of a Lethal Oxythermal Niche Boundary for Adult Ciscoes in Minnesota Lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Ciscoes Coregonus artedi are coldwater stenotherms that are sensitive indicators of ecological stressors, such as eutrophication and climate warming, that reduce coldwater habitat. Temperature and oxygen profile data were collected during cisco mortality events at 17 lakes during an unusually warm summer in Minnesota in 2006. Combinations of temperature and oxygen from the profiles were mapped onto a two-dimensional niche space to directly quantify an oxythermal lethal niche boundary for ciscoes. Quantile regression was used to estimate the niche boundary that described lethal combinations of oxygen and temperature for cisco. The fitted lethal oxythermal niche boundary exhibited a curvilinear interaction between lethal temperatures and lethal oxygen concentrations. The lethal temperature under normoxia (about 8 mg/L) was estimated to be 24 degrees C. Lethal temperatures were progressively less at lower lethal oxygen concentrations (e.g., the lethal temperature was 23.0 degrees C at 5.0 mg/L, 22.0 degrees C at 3.0 mg/L, and 19.5 degrees C at 1.0 mg/L). The lethal oxythermal niche boundary provides a basis for quantifying coldwater cisco habitat under current and future climate warming and water quality conditions.																			0002-8487					SEP	2008	137	5					1464	1474		10.1577/T07-148.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T07-148.1													WOS:000260704300018
J	Mortimer, CH				Mortimer, CH			The exchange of dissolved substances between mud and water in lakes	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Report of a study of the physical-chemical changes which take place at the mud-water interface in the hypolimnion of lakes and the resulting contributions of various nutritive substances to the water from the bottom deposits. Regular observations were made on Esthwaite Water, with laboratory expts. and data on other lakes obtained for comparison. 4 physical and 16 chemical factors were studied. Particular attention was given to the chemical changes taking place in the lower water after the onset of thermal stratification. As the season advanced the reduction of the O2 produced reducing conditions in this stratum as shown by the change in redox potential. Under these reducing conditions certain substances in the mud dissolved and these solutes moved upward into the water, due chiefly to eddy diffusion. Assuming that all of the solutes came from the mud, it was estimated that the mean eddy diffusion coeff. for selected levels was 20 to 2000 times the respective molecular coeffs. of heat conduction and chemical diffusion; even in winter when the lake was covered with ice, the eddy diffusion coeff. was > 200 times the molecular coeff. The reduction of the mud surface and the associated increase in the supply of solutes to the water depend upon the reducing power of the mud and the amt. of O2 supplied to the mud surface. At the time of the autumnal overturn in Oct., the solutes are distributed throughout the lake and thus become available to the phytoplankton.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1941	29						280	329		10.2307/2256395	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2256395													WOS:000200135500017

Therefore, in this study, waterbird habitat functions at the regional scale were assessed by using spatial principal component analysis (SPCA). According to the load matrix of principal components and the Redundancy analysis (RDA) method, the driving force of habitat function change and the mechanisms of their effects on waterbird guilds and diversity were revealed. The results showed that the areas of the highest and high habitat function grades continued to decline from 1987 to 2019, and the areas of the lowest and low grades of habitat function continued to increase. The overall habitat functions in the waterbird distribution areas were high, but the functional grades within different habitat sites were obviously decreasing. The main driving factors affecting habitat function change in Yancheng coastal wetlands from 1987 to 2019 were habitat types, habitat area, habitat diversity, habitat fragmentation, number of residential areas and reclamation intensity. The effects of these driving factors on the population diversity and distribution of waterbird guilds were different. Finally, countermeasures and suggestions for the functional maintenance and key node restoration of waterbird habitats in Yancheng coastal wetlands were proposed.

The number of rotifers was on average 10 times higher in lake areas showing high primary production as compared to oligo-mesotrophic areas. Keratella cochlearis, Keratella cochlearis tecta, Keratella quadrata, Kellicottia longispina, and Polyarthra spp. were collected from the whole lake area any time. Proalides tentaculatus and Liliferotrocha subtilis were abundant in summer in eu-hypertrophic areas, constituting 80-90% of the Rotatoria stock. These, as well as Trichocerca pusilla and the Synchaeta spp. were characteristic for highly trophic waters, while Brachionus urceolaris sessilis, Collotheca balatonica, and Pompholyx spp. were consistently found only in iligomesotropic lake areas. During the past 20 years, the composition of the Rotatoria plankton changed considerably in the hypertrophic lake areas, showing a 10-fold increase in abundance. In areas of low trophy, rotifer community structure changed to a lesser extent and the density remained constant.																			0003-9136					MAR	1989	115	1					111	123																WOS:A1989U052000010

We estimated the abundance of normative northern pike (2002-2003) and applied food habits data (1999-2003) to estimate their annual consumption of native bull trout Salvelinus confluentus and westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi juveniles in the upper Flathead River system, Montana. Population estimates were generally consistent among years and ranged from 1,200 to 1,300 individuals. Westslope cutthroat trout were present in the diet of younger (<600 mm) and older (>600 mm) northern pike during all seasons and bull trout were found only in larger northern pike during all seasons but summer. Bioenergetics modeling estimated that the northern pike population annually consumed a total of 8.0 metric tons (mt) of fish flesh; the highest biomass was composed of cyprmids (4.95 mt) followed by whitefishes Prosopitan spp. (1.02 mt), bull trout (0.80 mt), westslope cutthroat trout (0.68 mt), yellow perch Percaflavescens (0.41 mt),' and other fishes (centrarchids and cottids; 0.14 mt). Numerically, the northern pike population consumed more than 342,000 fish; cyprinids and catostomids comprised approximately 82% of prey fish (278,925), whereas over 13,000 westslope cutthroat trout and nearly 3,500 bull trout were eaten, comprising about 5% of the prey consumed. Our results suggest that predation by introduced northern pike is contributing to the lower abundance of native salmonids in the system and that a possible benefit might accrue to native salmonids by reducing these predatory interactions.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2008	28	3					636	648		10.1577/M07-004.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M07-004.1													WOS:000257780100003
J	Elmas, N; Bentli, I				Elmas, Numan; Bentli, Ismail			Environmental and depositional characteristics of diatomite deposit, Alayunt Neogene Basin (Kutahya), West Anatolia, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper describes the geological-depositional and environmental characteristics of diatomite. The diatomite deposit is situated in the southern part of the Alayunt (Kutahya) Basin. Samples of 18 diatomites and 12 host rocks were collected from four sedimentary profiles in the spring season. Basement rocks are Paleozoic-aged metamorphic rocks (schist, phyllite, quartzite, etc.) and Mesozoic-aged ophiolitic and complex rocks. Host rocks are rhyodacitic-rhyolitic tuffite, volcanic glass. Diatomite is composed of Upper Miocene-Upper Pliocene-aged diatom species. Diatomite shows layer morphology and lies on volcanic glass layer. XRD characteristic peaks of diatomite show that it comprises dominantly of Opal-A silica, whereas volcanic glass has Opal-CT constituent. SEM and NPM photomicrographs indicate that diatomites are dominantly composed of benthic freshwater diatom species, such as Pinnularia microstauron, Pinnularia lundii, Pinnularia subrostrata, Pinnularia brevicostata, Pinnularia tenuis, Pinnularia sp., Navicula eligensis, Fragilaria construens, Mastogloia braunii Grunow, Melosira varians Agardh, Surirella capronii Br,bisson, Cymbella lanceoloata, Amphora venata, Gomphonema germainii, Gomphonema angustatum and Rhapalodia gibba. These species are general indicators of shallow paleolake environment and cool climate conditions. Due to the fluvial currents and climatic conditions; lake water levels, temperature and nutrient content fluctuated through the time. Chemical data obtained from 18 diatomite samples show that while silica is the bodybuilding material for diatomite (over 89 % SiO2), Al, Mg and Fe contents of diatomite samples might be derived from clastic materials. The concentration of Al, Mg and Fe decreases toward the lake center. Diatom genera, sedimentary profile sections and mineralogic data suggest that diatomite deposited in lacustrine-type freshwater shallow lake is associated with Upper Miocene-aged extension tectonics. Physical and filtration tests along with environmental characteristics of diatomite suggest that calcined diatomite can be used for waste treatment processes in the filter aid industry.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2013	68	2					395	412		10.1007/s12665-012-1745-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-012-1745-5													WOS:000313059400006

Gary; Tomascak, Paul B.; Pearl, Crystal			High-resolution chemostratigraphic record of late Pleistocene lake-level variability, Mono Lake, California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The study of abrupt changes in global climate requires high-resolution records for which the connection to the climate system is well understood. Because lake systems are by their nature unique, ground truthing of geochemical measurements against directly observable physical evidence is required. The Mono Lake basin exposes multiple outcrops of lake sediments deposited during the last glacial period, providing the opportunity to reconstruct lake-level changes through stratigraphy-based interpretation of high-resolution records. Here we present a record of bulk-sediment carbonate derived from overlapping sections in three outcrops around the Mono Lake basin. We interpret this record as a reflection of lake-level variation, based on well-exposed stratigraphy and sedimentary facies changes. The co-variation of lake level with Sr isotopes measured in ostracodes is interpreted to reflect increased proportion of water supplied from the eastern basin during wet times. This high carbonate-high lake-level relationship is the opposite of the high carbonate-low lake-level relationship inferred in nearby Owens Lake, a difference attributable to extreme differences in basin geometry affecting the frequency of spilling conditions and resultant lake chemistry.					; Zimmerman, Susan/A-3351-2013	Zimmerman, Susan/0000-0002-1320-1878; Hemming, Sidney/0000-0001-8117-2303													0016-7606	1943-2674				NOV-DEC	2011	123	11-12					2320	2334		10.1130/B30377.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B30377.1													WOS:000295402600013

Cyanobacteria belonging to the Nostocales order form akinetes that are similar to the seeds of vascular plants, which are resting cells surrounded by a thick membrane. They overwinter in sediment and germinate when conditions become favorable, eventually developing into vegetative cells and causing blooms. This review covers the cyanobacterial akinete of the Nostocales order and summarizes the environmental triggers and cellular responses involved in akinete germination and formation based on data from the literature. It also emphasizes the intimate and dynamic relationship that exists between the germination and formation of akinete in the annual life cycle of cyanobacteria. After comparing many published data, it is found that the tolerance ranges for factors affecting both akinete germination and formation do not differ significantly and are broadly consistent with the tolerance ranges for vegetative cell growth. However, the optimal range varies with different species and strains of cyanobacteria. The life cycle of cyanobacteria, as a result of akinete germination and formation, has a seasonal periodicity and spatial connectivity between the water column and the sediment. However, during the summer growing season, intimate coupling between akinete formation and germination can occur in the water column, and this can contribute to high population densities being maintained in the water column. During this time, shallow sediment could also provide suitable conditions for akinete germination, thereby contributing to the establishment of water column populations. The information summarized in this review is expected to help improve our shared understanding of the life cycle of the Nostocales cyanobacteria while also providing insights into the monitoring and management of harmful algal blooms.

However, it is not clear whether pseudodiaptomids (e.g., Schmackeria), one of the dominant calanoid copepods in Chinese lakes, effectively impacts natural ciliate communities. The impacts of small-bodied cladocerans (e.g., Bosmina) on ciliates are also controversial. We performed an incubation experiment using winter lake water from Lake Chaohu to assess the structuring effects that crustacean zooplankton have on natural ciliate populations. The presence and absence of cladocerans (Bosmina sp.) and copepods (Schmackeria inopinus) were alternated in four treatments. Both Bosmina sp. and Schmackeria inopinus had substantial impacts on ciliate abundance, biomass, and community structure. The response of ciliates was different in the presence of Bosmina sp. compared with Schmackeria inopinus and varied among categories such as the ciliate population, relative body size and functional feeding group. Our results also highlight the importance of interference and exploitative competition among metazooplankton groups.

We found that the Holocene climate in northern Mongolia has been alternating between cold (or cool)/wet conditions and warm/arid conditions, and also punctuated with a series of abrupt climate shifts. The abrupt climate shifts occurred around 1750, 2800, 4000, 5200, 7200, and 9200 aBP (C-14 age), being chronologically correlative to those abrupt climatic events recorded in the high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean. The correlation indicates that the climatic changes in northern Mongolia were linked with those in the North Atlantic Ocean probably via the North Atlantic Oscillation-affected westerly winds. The strength and position of westerly winds might have modulated the Siberian-Mongolian high pressure system (winter monsoon), directly influencing the climate in China.

This study verifies the taxonomic validity of D. catawba by establishing its genetic divergence from other species of Daphnia that occur in eastern North America. In addition, it reveals the presence of a second, closely allied species, D. minnehaha, which had previously been placed in synonomy with D. pulex. Daphnia catawba and D. minnehaha share a preference for acidic habitats and are restricted to the deciduous and boreal forest regions of the eastern portion of the continent. where D. catawba is restricted to lakes, while D. minnehaha occurs in ponds. Both species reproduce by cyclic parthenogenesis and, based on the extent of their allozyme differentiation, last had a. common ancestor more than 7 million years ago.

However, it remains unclear how changes in seasonal water level affect littoral widths by regulating plant diversity and soil nutrient content. This study selected three elevation ranges in the lakeshore of Erhai: supralittoral, eulittoral, and infralittoral. We explored the effects of hydrological changes on littoral widths and their potential relationships by analyzing seasonal differences in plant communities and soil physicochemical properties during an extremely drought year. Our results indicated that the most significant seasonal differences in diversity indices, biomass, and soil physicochemical properties were observed in the eulittoral, followed by the infralittoral and supralittoral. The niche breadths of perennials was significantly decreased by 44.4% and the width of the eulittoral was significantly decreased by 48.6% during the winter. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were applied to analyze the elevation distribution ranges of dominant species. The results revealed that species with monotonically increasing distributions had the widest niche breadths, followed by symmetric unimodal species, while monotonically decreasing species exhibited the narrowest. Structural equation modeling revealed a positive and significant correlation between flooding days and soil water content and pH, and a negative correlation with plant parameters (species number, biomass, and coverage). Moreover, plant parameters showed a significant positive correlation with plant diversity. Importantly, plant diversity and soil nutrients were significantly positively correlated with littoral widths, suggesting their key roles in influencing littoral widths. This study highlights the significant impact of hydrological seasonal changes on the littoral widths of lakeshore zones, providing valuable guidance for managing wetland water levels in response to extreme drought events.																			1664-462X					MAR 20	2025	16								1503627	10.3389/fpls.2025.1503627	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2025.1503627								40182541					WOS:001457585400001

Glacier retreat creating new Pacific salmon habitat in western North America	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Glacier retreat poses risks and benefits for species of cultural and economic importance. One example is Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), supporting subsistence harvests, and commercial and recreational fisheries worth billions of dollars annually. Although decreases in summer streamflow and warming freshwater is reducing salmon habitat quality in parts of their range, glacier retreat is creating new streams and lakes that salmon can colonize. However, potential gains in future salmon habitat associated with glacier loss have yet to be quantified across the range of Pacific salmon. Here we project future gains in Pacific salmon freshwater habitat by linking a model of glacier mass change for 315 glaciers, forced by five different Global Climate Models, with a simple model of salmon stream habitat potential throughout the Pacific Mountain ranges of western North America. We project that by the year 2100 glacier retreat will create 6,146 (+/- 1,619) km of new streams accessible for colonization by Pacific salmon, of which 1,930 (+/- 569) km have the potential to be used for spawning and juvenile rearing, representing 0 to 27% gains within the 18 sub-regions we studied. These findings can inform proactive management and conservation of Pacific salmon in this era of rapid climate change. Potential gains in future salmon habitat associated with glacier loss have yet to be quantified.

During fall 2018, we monitored the co-occurrence of cyanobacteria and microcystin (MC) in both the water column and in surface sediments at five stations along a river continuum, from a freshwater reservoir to the coastal area in Brittany, France. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in the water column with high densities at the freshwater sites. Microcystis cells and intracellular MC transfer to estuarine and marine sites were observed with decreasing concentrations in accordance with flow dilution. Extracellular MC showed the opposite trend and increased from upstream to downstream in accordance with the lysing of the cells at elevated salinities. Surface sediment samples contained high densities of colonial Microcystis in freshwater and with decreasing concentrations along the salinity gradient, similar to cells concentrations in the water column. Intracellular MC was detected in sediment at all sites except at the marine outlet suggesting the survival of intact cells. Extracellular MC concentrations in sediment were up to five times higher than intracellular concentrations suggesting incomplete MC degradation. mcyB genes were present at all sites, while mcyA genes were absent at the marine outlet suggesting the presence of toxic strains along the estuary. The high densities of intact colonies of potentially toxic Microcystis in the estuarine sediment strongly suggest that sediments can act as an inoculum of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in estuaries.					; Lance, Emilie/AAZ-4540-2020	Lance, Emilie/0000-0003-1731-0390; Legrand, Benjamin/0000-0001-7450-7996													1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2020	54	2					625	640		10.1007/s10452-020-09764-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-020-09764-y													WOS:000529831700012

These watersheds are recurrently affected by the deposition of tephra erupted from the many active Andean volcanos located in the Southern Volcanic Zone. This research focusses on two fluvial systems (Pireco and Totoral, PT) located in Nahuel Huapi National Park, which were severely impacted by the Cordon Caulle 2011 eruption (CC2011). We investigate particularly the resedimentation of pyroclastic materials on their lacustrine deltas and its potential implications considering 1) the deltas morphology and 2) mass-wasting processes developing at the delta fronts. Original tephra fall deposits were registered at Nahuel Huapi National Park in 2011. Based on the isopach map, we performed a GIS-based volume estimation of the deposit for the studied watersheds. Delta plain progradation from 2011 to 2017 was analyzed from satellite images. We studied the temporal evolution of the subaqueous morphology and mass-wasting processes at the delta fronts using high resolution bathymetric grids registered in 2011, 2014 and 2017. During June 2011 the studied watersheds received a tephra input of similar to 72 x 10(6)m(3). The significant progradation experienced by both deltas especially during the first month of the eruption was favored by 1) abundant precipitation at the watersheds concomitant to heavy tephra deposition and 2) the pre-existing subaqueous morphology characterized by a wide, shallow "terrace" bordering PT delta plains. About six years after the beginning of CC2011, 6% of the tephra fallen over the entire basins had been resedimented at the delta environments (terrace and delta front), totalizing similar to 3 x 10(6)t. Evidence of pre-eruption and/or co-eruptive mass-wasting processes occurring at PT delta fronts was found on November 2011. Up to 30-m thick pyroclastic deposits were accumulated at PT delta fronts since November 2011, burying mass-wasting features at the upper delta fronts. A suspended-sediment collector installed at the prodelta in 2012 detected hyperpycnal currents transporting pyroclastic materials. These currents probably explain the development of mass-movements at high depths, such as the one that displaced and filled up the bottom sediment trap. This frontally-confined land-slide initiated at a depth of >60 m and involved tephra and organic materials deposited at the lower part of Totoral delta front. Because of their recent deposition and loose consolidation, we propose that fresh tephra deposits at PT delta fronts could become particularly unstable and represent a potential hazard to failure, especially if a strong earthquake affects the study area in the next years.

Multiscale change detection in a supraglacial stream using surface drifters	RIVER FLOW 2020					10th River Flow Conference on Fluvial Hydraulics	JUL 07-10, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Delft Univ Technol, United Nat Educ, Sci & Cultural Org, Inst Water Educ, Deltares, Rijkswaterstaat, Minist Infrastructure & Water Management				High-resolution (1 - 10 m) observations of supraglacial streams are needed to improve process understanding and inform low-resolution (25 - 100 m) remote sensing observations and numerical models. To address this, we built small (0.25 m diameter) satellite positioning drifters. The devices recorded the surface flow velocity, linear acceleration and magnetic field intensity along a 250 m supraglacial channel during the summer ablation period from 30.06 to 04.07.2019 at Austre Broggerbreen, Svalbard. Cross correlation analysis was performed on channel-fitted coordinates. Multiscale change detection was carried out by increasing the averaging window of the time series data and the stream-wise spacing of the drifter's planar coordinates. The locations of channel bends and step-risers were found to correspond to clearly defined changes in the streamwise cross correlations of the flow speed, magnetic field intensity magnitude and acceleration magnitude. The proposed drifter-based approach provides a simple method to collect and assess high-resolution satellite drifter data for multiscale planform change detection in supraglacial channels.

Using novel methods, we determined clearance, capture, and assimilation rates for zebra mussels feeding on natural and laboratory M. aeruginosa strains offered alone or in combination with other algae. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that zebra mussels promoted blooms of toxic M. aeruginosa in Saginaw Bay, western Lake Erie, and other lakes through selective rejection in pseudofeces. Mussels exhibited high feeding rates similar to those seen for a highly desirable food alga (Cryptomonas) with both large ( > 53 mum) and small (< 53 mum) colonies of a nontoxic and a toxic laboratory strain of M. aeruginosa known to cause blockage of feeding in zooplankton. In experiments with naturally occurring toxic M. aeruginosa from Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie and a toxic isolate from Lake Erie, mussels exhibited lowered or normal filtering rates with rejection of M. aeruginosa in pseudofeces. Selective rejection depended on "unpalatable" toxic strains of M. aeruginosa occurring as large colonies that could be rejected efficiently while small desirable algae were ingested.					; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020	Liebig, James/0000-0002-0433-9066; Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2001	58	6					1208	1221		10.1139/cjfas-58-6-1208	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-6-1208													WOS:000168890500016

These determinations indicate that several metabolic sources are used to fuel the energy requirements of muscle. Lamprey muscle has a high capacity to oxidize lipids but the plasma NEFAs are lower than those reported for other species. Of the NEFAs measured in plasma, 18:0 was prominent, accounting for 23% of the total NEFA content of the plasma. High plasma concentrations of ketogenic amino acids and high levels of tissue ketogenic/ketolytic enzyme activities indicate that ketone bodies may also be a major fuel source for migrating sea lampreys. Based on mitochondrial oxidation and enzyme measurements, glutamine catabolism in somatic muscle of lampreys is less important than in other fish red muscle.																			0008-4301					MAY	1995	73	5					916	923		10.1139/z95-107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z95-107													WOS:A1995RR09100012

Stable isotope and petrologic evidence for open-system degassing during the climactic and pre-climactic eruptions of Mt. Mazama, Crater Lake, Oregon	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Evaluation of the extent of volatile element recycling in convergent margin volcanism requires delineating likely source(s) of magmatic volatiles through stable isotopic characterization of sulfur, hydrogen and oxygen in erupted tephra with appropriate assessment of modification by degassing. The climactic eruption of Mt. Mazama ejected approximately 50 km(3) of rhyodacitic magma into the atmosphere and resulted in formation of a 10-km diameter caldera now occupied by Crater Lake, Oregon (lat. 43 degrees N, long. 122 degrees W). Isotopic compositions of whole-rocks, matrix glasses and minerals from Mt. Mazarna climactic, pre-climactic and postcaldera tephra were determined to identify the likely source(s) of H2O and S. Integration of stable isotopic data with petrologic data from melt inclusions has allowed for estimation of pre-eruptive dissolved volatile concentrations and placed constraints on the extent, conditions and style of degassing. Sulfur isotope analyses of climactic rhyodacitic whole rocks yield delta S-34 values of 2.8-14.8 parts per thousand with corresponding matrix glass values of 2.4-13.2 parts per thousand. delta S-34 tends to increase with stratigraphic height through climactic eruptive units, consistent with open-system degassing. Dissolved sulfur concentrations in melt inclusions (MIs) from pre-climactic and climactic rhyodacitic pumices varies from 80 to 330 ppm, with highest concentrations in inclusions with 4.8-5.2 wt% H2O (by FTIR). Up to 50% of the initial S may have been lost through pre-eruptive degassing at depths of 4-5 km. Ion microprobe analyses of pyrrhotite in climactic rhyodacitic tephra and andesitic scoria indicate a range in delta S-34 from -0.4 parts per thousand to 5.8 parts per thousand and from -0.1 parts per thousand to 3.5 parts per thousand, respectively. Initial delta S-34 values of rhyodacitic and andesitic magmas were likely near the mantle value of 0 parts per thousand. Hydrogen isotope (delta D) and total H2O analyses of rhyodacitic obsidian (and vitrophyre) from the climactic fall deposit yielded values of -103 to -53 parts per thousand and 0.23-1.74 wt%, respectively. Values of delta D and wt% H2O of obsidian decrease towards the top of the fall deposit. Samples with depleted delta D. and mantle delta O-18 values, have elevated delta S-34 values consistent with open-system degassing. These results imply that more mantle-derived sulfur is degassed to the Earth's atmosphere/hydrosphere through convergent margin volcanism than previously attributed. Magmatic degassing can modify initial isotopic compositions of sulfur by >14% (to delta S-34 values of 14 parts per thousand or more here) and hydrogen isotopic compositions by 90 parts per thousand (to delta D values of -127 parts per thousand in this case).

J	Hooke, JM				Hooke, JM			Cutoffs galore!: occurrence and causes of multiple cutoffs on a meandering river	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The creation of cutoffs and of oxbow lakes is a well-known phenomenon of meandering rivers, but views on the extent to which they are inherent in meander behaviour have varied. Assumptions of meander behaviour have shifted from those of stability and equilibrium to recognition of gradual evolution and increased complexity of form. Alternative explanations of cutoff occurrence are discussed here in relation to a remarkable set of cutoffs that occurred in one reach of the River Bollin, UK, for which long-term historical evidence of meander evolution existed and which has been monitored for change and processes over the last 20 years. The cutoffs occurred during the high floods of winter 2000-2001. A series of hypotheses is examined, including the occurrence of floods and effects of hydrological changes. Although the flood events actually caused the cutoffs, the long-term pattern accords with ideas of chaotic behaviour and sinuosity of a river reaching a critical state at which clustering of meander cutoffs takes place. It is suggested that the occurrence of the cutoffs can be explained as inherent in meander behaviour.

J	Klingbjer, P				Klingbjer, P			Recurring Jokulhlaups in Salka, northern Sweden	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												An ice-dammed lake at the margin of the glacier Salkaglaciaren, in the Kebnekaise Mountains in northern Sweden, drained suddenly in July 2003 producing a flood with a measured peak discharge of 9.5 +/- 0.25 m(3)s(-1). The total lake volume of 4,55 x 10(5) m(3) drained within two days. The hydrograph of this event is characteristic of a jokulhlaup controlled by a single basal ice tunnel that enlarges due to melting. The jokulhlaup had an exponential rise to a peak discharge, and following the peak, a very steep fall in discharge as the water supply to the drainage system ceased. A similar jokulhlaup was observed in August 1990 with an estimated release of 8.05 x 10(5) m(3) water. Jokulhlaups at Salkaglaciaren are recurring events and have been indirectly observed since the 1950s.																			0435-3676	1468-0459					2004	86A	2					169	179		10.1111/j.0435-3676.2004.00222.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0435-3676.2004.00222.x													WOS:000222637600005

In addition, seasonal fluctuations in water chemistry and chlorophyll-a development in the main channel of the Lower Rhine and five floodplain lakes along a flooding gradient were monitored. The species composition of the summer phytoplankton in these lakes was studied as well. At present very high levels of chloride. sodium, sulphate. phosphate and nitrate are found in the main channels of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, resulting from industrial. agricultural and domestic sewage. Together with the actual concentrations of major ions and nutrients in the main channel, the annual flood duration determines the physico-chemistry of the floodplain lakes. The river water influences the water chemistry of these lakes not only via inundations, but also via seepage. A comparison of recent and historical chemical data shows an increase over the years in the levels of chloride both in the main channel of the Lower Rhine and in seepage lakes along this river. Levels of alkalinity in floodplain lakes showed an inverse relationship with annual flood duration, because sulphur retention and alkalinization occurred in seepage waters and rarely-flooded lakes. The input of large quantities of nutrients (N, P) from the main channel has resulted, especially in frequently flooded lakes, in an increase in algal biomass and a shift in phytoplankton composition from a diatom dominated community towards a community dominated by chlorophytes and cyanobacteria.					van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011														0168-2563						1993	19	2					103	128																WOS:A1993LF62800003

In deep lakes, no significant differences were observed between mean summer nutrient concentrations measured in (i) a tube sample integrating over the photic zone taken from the deepest point; (ii) a surface dip sample taken at the deepest point; (iii) a surface dip sample taken by wading into the water''s edge; (iv) a dip sample taken slightly further off shore by suspending a bottle below a buoy thrown out about 30 m from the shore; and (v) a sample taken along a short transect out from the shore using a model boat to transport the sample bottle. In shallower lakes the integrating tube sampler gave significantly higher estimates of mean concentrations than other methods due to the increase in volume of the unmixed hypolimnion which reduced the depth of the well mixed epilimnion to less than the tube length. For national survey purposes samples taken from the edge of the lake are the most cost effective.																			0269-7491	1873-6424					1989	57	3					223	234		10.1016/0269-7491(89)90014-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(89)90014-6								15092451					WOS:A1989T920000004

The properties and morphology of Fe3O4@ILs-beta-CDCP were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD), size distribution and magnetic analysis. A new method of magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) coupled to ICP-OES for the speciation of Mn(II)/Mn(VII) in water samples was established. The results showed that Mn(VII) and total manganese [Mn(II)+Mn(VII)] were quantitatively extracted after adjusting aqueous sample solution to pH 6.0 and 10.0, respectively. Mn(II) was calculated by subtraction of Mn(VII) from total manganese. Fe3O4@ILs-beta-CDCP showed a higher adsorption capacity toward Mn(II) and Mn(VII). Several factors, such as the pH value, extraction temperature and sample volume, were optimized to achieve the best extraction efficiency. Moreover, the adsorption ability of Fe3O4@ILs-beta-CDCP would not be significantly lower after reusing of 10 times. The accuracy of the developed method was confirmed by analyzing certified reference materials (GSB 07-1189-2000), and by spiking spring water, city water and lake water samples.

Obliquity Control On Southern Hemisphere Climate During The Last Glacial	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Recent paleoclimate reconstructions have challenged the traditional view that Northern Hemisphere insolation and associated feedbacks drove synchronous global climate and ice-sheet volume during the last glacial cycle. Here we focus on the response of the Patagonian Ice Sheet, and demonstrate that its maximum expansion culminated at 28,400 +/- 500 years before present (28.4 +/- 0.5 ka), more than 5,000 years before the minima in 65 degrees N summer insolation and the formally-defined Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at 21,000 +/- 2,000 years before present. To investigate the potential drivers of this early LGM (eLGM), we simulate the effects of orbital changes using a suite of climate models incorporating prescribed and evolving sea-ice anomalies. Our analyses suggest that Antarctic sea-ice expansion at 28.5 ka altered the location and intensity of the Southern Hemisphere storm track, triggering regional cooling over Patagonia of 5 degrees C that extends across the wider mid-southern latitudes. In contrast, at the LGM, continued sea-ice expansion reduced regional temperature and precipitation further, effectively starving the ice sheet and resulting in reduced glacial expansion. Our findings highlight the dominant role that orbital changes can play in driving Southern Hemisphere glacial climate via the sensitivity of mid-latitude regions to changes in Antarctic sea-ice extent.					; Hutchinson, David/F-4564-2016; Fogwill, Chris/AAW-3502-2021; Taschetto, Andrea/H-2050-2011; Fogwill, Christopher/KWU-8243-2024; Turney, Chris/P-8701-2018; England, Matthew/A-7539-2011; Hutchinson, David K/F-4564-2016	Taschetto, Andrea/0000-0001-6020-1603; Fogwill, Christopher/0000-0002-6471-1106; Turney, Chris/0000-0001-6733-0993; England, Matthew/0000-0001-9696-2930; Hutchinson, David K/0000-0001-9385-4782													2045-2322					JUN 26	2015	5								11673	10.1038/srep11673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep11673								26115344					WOS:000357001900002

To better understand the impact of hydrological and phenological variables on floodplain waterbird habitats during drought conditions, we employed hydrological modeling and remote sensing techniques to calculate fine scale environmental variables. We constructed habitat suitability models using nine years of field surveys of waterbirds and identified the impact of the interaction effects between hydrological and phenological variables on waterbirds under drought and non-drought conditions. The results showed that hydrological and phenological variables can provide useful information for quantifying the habitat suitability of waterbirds. Drought-induced early water recession negatively impacted the quality of waterbird habitats, reducing their habitat suitability. Sedge eaters exhibited the most significant reduction of 34.47% in the total area of the lake, followed by seed eaters, fish eaters and invertebrate eaters. Tuber eaters had the largest increasing trend, with a significant increase area of 7.44% in total area. Our findings suggest that various feeding guilds exhibit distinct interactions in response to drought, which can be strengthened or weakened by alterations resulting from drought. For sedge eaters, seed eaters, and fish eaters, drought could result in a faster decline in habitat suitability by strengthening the interaction effects between variables. In contrast, for invertebrate eaters and tuber eaters, drought could weaken interaction effects between variables, resulting in a slower decline in habitat quality. The results provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of overwintering waterbirds and can inform conservation efforts in wetlands.					; Li, Weixiang/JED-9994-2023; Li, Zhongwu/AAF-9530-2020; Liang, Jie/P-4649-2015; , 米立小子/AHA-7181-2022	Lu, Lan/0000-0003-3209-9052; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2023	626		A						130228	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130228		SEP 2023											WOS:001095869200001

The objective of this study was to evaluate the functioning of three water bodies in a river-lake system restored around 30 years ago. Particular attention was paid to water quality and the trophic status of the analyzed lakes, assessed based on seasonal changes in phosphorus concentrations. A river-lake system comprising restored water bodies in rural areas reduces the concentrations of biogens migrating from the catchment area, thus minimizing the effects of potential eutrophication in larger rivers and other water bodies to which the system's watercourses evacuate. As regards lake inflows, a drop in total phosphorus levels was noted after passage through the water body, and high concentrations of total P resulted from the polymictic character of the studied lakes. The inflows to water bodies that form a chain system supply substantial amounts of total P to the lakes, leading to the retention of excessive phosphorus concentrations and speeding up processes which deteriorate water quality and lake functioning. Over a three-year experimental period, the average concentrations of phosphorus, - an element limiting primary production - varied from 0.22 to 0.34 mg P-total . dm(-3) in the water bodies within the studied river-lake system. The absence of water stratification (hypolimnion) contributed to intensive phosphorus recirculation and very high trophy levels in the examined lakes. According to Nurnberg, the total phosphorus concentrations determined in the spring are indicative of their hypetrophy.

To investigate the main causes, the heat tolerance of E. nuttallii was studied and compared with that of native species Ceratopkyllum demersum by using an aquaria system in the laboratory. Under 4500 lx light intensity and 12-h L/12-h D cycle, E. nuttallii cultured in 1/5 Hoaglands solution at 39 degrees C showed a positive growth rate during the first 15 days, and the growth rate was higher than that at 35 degrees C. But after 15 days, the growth rates became negative for those cultured both at 39 and 35 degrees C. However, the growth rate was positive for more than 20 days for those cultured at 25 degrees C. Under the same conditions, the growth rate, productivity and chlorophyll content of E. nuttallii were significantly higher than that of C. demersum. Heat tolerance of E. nuttallii was also stronger than that of C. demersum. The optimal temperature for the growth of the two plants depended on the experimental period: both plants grew at an optimal rate at higher temperature if the experimental period was short; nevertheless the plants achieved optimal growth at a lower temperature if the experiment was conducted for a longer period. At the same light intensity, the heat tolerance of C. demersum in tap water with sediment was markedly stronger than that of E. nuttallii at 39 degrees C. Average growth rate of C. demersum was 4.5 times higher than that of E. nuttallii within 25 days. The positive growth period lasted for less than 25 days for E. nuttallii and for more than 25 days for C. demersum. When they were cultured in 1/5 Hoaglands solution and in tap water with sediment, the growth rate of C. demersum increased from 0.4 to 79.4 mg/d.g fresh weight (FW) within 20 days. E. nuttallii increased from 8.3 to 24.4 mg/d-g FW within 20 days. Both grew better in tap water with sediment than in 1/5 Hoaglands solution. The results demonstrated that the nutritional status of the water other than the high temperature affected the heat tolerance of E. nuttallii during summer. E. nuttallii has great ecological safe risk in China.					jiang, min/D-2531-2009														1018-4619	1610-2304					2009	18	9					1588	1596																WOS:000270702200007
J	Bartov, Y; Enzel, Y; Porat, N; Stein, M				Bartov, Yuval; Enzel, Yehounda; Porat, Naomi; Stein, Mordechai			Evolution of the late pleistocene-holocene dead sea basin from sequence statigraphy of fan deltas and lake-level reconstruction	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Patterns of sediment transport to the Dead Sea basin during late Pleistocene and Holocene times were evaluated by comparing previously established lake levels with patterns of transgressions and regressions in fan deltas at the lake margins. While the lake-level history reflects the hydrological regime in the drainage basin, the transgression-regression patterns reflect the response of the elastic sediment transport to the regional hydrology and morphology of the basin. By using the two techniques we are able to demonstrate the time relationship between the factors controlling the deposition. Six sequences are exposed at the western margins of the basin. Their chronology was obtained by U-Th, radiocarbon, and luminescence ages on aragonite and quartz sand from the Samra, Lisan, and Ze'elim formations, which cover the past similar to 160 ka. Our data shows a lag between periods of high water inflow and elastic sediment flux to the basin. During highstands the sediments were stored in deep (100-200 m), long estuaries that formed in incised canyons into the east and west bounding escarpments. During lake-level falls the stored sediments were flushed out, forming prograding lowstand fan deltas. This leads to a high sediment flux during early stages of and conditions following extreme high lake levels.					; Stein, Mordechai/AAJ-3200-2020; Enzel, Yehouda/AAV-5829-2021; Porat, Naomi/R-1474-2019	Porat, Naomi/0000-0002-5900-2460; Bartov, Yuval/0000-0003-0172-3553; 													1527-1404	1938-3681				SEP-OCT	2007	77	9-10					680	692		10.2110/jsr.2007.070	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2007.070													WOS:000249664900002

Based on stomach analyses of 1,308 alewives collected during the springs of 1984-1986, predation on larval yellow perch occurred primarily at night in littoral areas during the 2 weeks immediately following peak hatch of yellow perch. Among stomachs of all alewives caught at night in littoral areas, 30% in 1985 (N = 43) and 41% in 1986 (N = 71) contained yellow perch larvae. Mean numbers of whole larvae per alewife stomach were 3.8 in 1985 and 32.6 in 1986. As many as 361 intact larval yellow perch were found in one stomach. Mean total lengths of yellow perch consumed on two dates in mid-May 1986 were 7.3 and 7.6 mm compared to mean sizes of 8.0 and 8.6 mm of larvae living within the bay. We suggest predation by alewives on yellow perch larvae may reduce yellow perch recruitment in Lake Ontario as well as in other Great Lakes.

Fisheries management in these lakes was based on intensive stocking with vendace (Coregonus albula) larvae and summer fry of European whitefish (C. lavaretus) and peled (C. peled). A high level of stocking efficiency did not necessarily provide the best economic results. The irregular relationship between the efficiency and economic viability of stocking was explained by a model that used the input and output prices of stocked and caught fish. At a given level of stocking efficiency, the economic results of the measure could be positive, negative or equal to zero and demonstrated upward, downward or stable trends, depending on the price ratio. Net returns were positive as long as the rates of stocking efficiency were below the value of the input-output price ratio. Net return amounted to zero when the price ratio equaled the rate of stocking efficiency.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BAIKALIAN AMPHIPOD (GMELINOIDES FASCIATUS, AMPHIPODA, CRUSTACEA) IN LAKE ONEGA	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The distribution of the Baikalian amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus (Stebbing) was studied in the northern part of Lake Onega. In the summer of 2001, this invasive species was recorded oil the southwestern coast of this lake for the first time. Presently, in most regions studied, G. fasciatus becomes the dominant species in the lit-toral zoobenthos communities (54-89% of the number of the species studied). Its number was 31000 ind./m(2); the biomass, 15 g/m(2). However. the northwestern coast of Lake Onega is considered as a zone of a rather early stage of the biological invasion of this species due to the low values of quantitative parameters of the development of G. fasciatus and the presence of the native amphipod, Gammarus lacustris Sars. The fast propagation of G. fasciatus appears to be provoked by the unintended introduction of this species into the northern part of Lake Onega with ballast water of large vessels. Therefore, the northern border of the distribution of G. fasciatus in the European part of Russia has been advanced LIP to the latitude 63 degrees N.																			0044-5134					OCT	2008	87	10					1270	1273																WOS:000261228600012

The distribution of dissolved Zn appears to be affected by algal cycling in two ways: in the period up to and including the diatom maximum, dissolved Zn correlates (P < 0.01) positively with phosphate and silicate, indicating atomic C:P:Zn ratios of 106:1:0.034, and negatively with Chl a; and following stratification, epilimnetic concentrations are significantly (P < 0.01) less than those in the hypolimnion. Dissolved Cu distributions are unaffected by the spring diatom bloom. The Zn and Cu contents of the diatom standing crop were also determined by elemental analysis of suspended particulate material in two consecutive years, providing independent estimates of metal stoichiometry. Mass budgets indicate a substantial removal and transfer to the sediments of Zn via phytoplankton, but a negligible effect on the cycling of Cu.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				DEC	1992	37	8					1759	1769		10.4319/lo.1992.37.8.1759	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.8.1759													WOS:A1992KR73700014

The importance of different habitat features influencing habitat selection was assessed using ordination technique. The presence of holts, spraint sites, grooming sites and footprints were considered as good indicators of the use of an area by the otters. For foraging, otters selected less rocky areas of the shallower parts of the lake, which are narrower and slanting. The number of streams joining these areas was more than on the other stretches of the lake and the bankside vegetation was dense. The deeper and wider areas of the lake were avoided. Holts were found in a variety of habitats, such as grass and Lantana thickets, rock crevices and under fallen logs and roots of standing trees at an average distance of 18 m from the water level. Grooming sites were characterized by high sand content and nearness to water.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				AUG	2004	263		4				417	423		10.1017/S0952836904005461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952836904005461													WOS:000223323200010

J	Kattel, DB; Yao, TD				Kattel, Dambaru Ballab; Yao, Tandong			Forces for recent snow cover variation on the Mount Everest region	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Due to the lack of high-altitude observational datasets, a better understanding of snow cover changes and meteorological forcing for their variation in the Mount Everest region is still insufficient. This study examined changes in snow cover over the Mount Everest region and their relationship to air temperature, albedo (surface and snow), and total precipitation. This study used data from the MERRA2, ERA5-Land, JRA55, FLDAS, and CERES products spanning 41 years (1981-2021). For comparison and evaluation, we also used a ground station, Pyramid, located at a high elevation (5050 masl) at the foot of Mount Everest on the southern slope. The results confirmed a significant decline in snow cover during winter and post-monsoon seasons, which was observed in all datasets. Changes in surface and snow albedo and total precipitation positively correlate with the variation in snow cover; however, this relationship reverses with air temperature. This research suggests that atmospheric warming caused a decline in snow cover in the Mount Everest region. This decline affected snow and surface albedo, causing further warming and contributing to the continued decline in snow cover in the study area. The reduction in precipitation further contributes to the decrease in snow cover in the Mount Everest region. The variations in snow cover in this study correspond to those found in earlier studies on glacier thinning in cryosphere regions. Anthropogenic activities have linked these variations to increasing air temperatures while decreasing snowfall, precipitation, and albedo.

J	Moss, B				Moss, Brian			Climate change, nutrient pollution and the bargain of Dr Faustus	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The legend of Dr Faustus crops up repeatedly in European literature, drama and music, suggesting that it has profound meaning. In our relationship with the biosphere we have perhaps made a Faustian bargain. In return for unrestrained use of the Earth's resources, we may have mortgaged a long-term future. Currently we are hoping to renegotiate the bargain, but there is detail in the small-print-clauses about climate change, destruction of ecosystems and consequent release of nutrients to waterways that we have ignored. Natural biomes determine that the biosphere is maintained in a state favourable to our particular biochemistry. Part of the mechanism is regulation of atmospheric gas composition through storage of carbon as biological deposits. 2. Shallow lakes and wetlands, and the tundras and forests of wet soil, store carbon at a much greater rate than the global ocean. The influence, on shallow lake systems, of warming coupled with degrees of eutrophication has been studied in replicated experimental ponds. The first experiment used modest nutrient addition and a 3 degrees C rise in temperature. Such warming led to some increase in phosphorus availability, takeover by an introduced warm-water species, Lagarosiphon major of the submerged plant community, and an increase in the frequency of severe deoxygenation, with occasional fish kills. 3. The second experiment used a rise of 4 degrees C against a similar ambient background to that of the first experiment, but a nutrient environment much closer to that of lowland eutrophicated waters. Especially with moderate nitrogen loading, floating duckweeds became very abundant, though submerged plants persisted. Oxygen concentrations fell markedly. Final fish biomass fell by 60% on warming and 80% at the highest nutrient loading used, but the combination of warming and even modest nutrients brought oxygen frequently to zero overnight and killed all the fish. Because the fish used (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were extremely resilient, there are severe implications for many other European fish species. 4. Analysis of oxygen curves allowed calculation of metabolic parameters of the tank systems. Both warming and nutrient addition substantially increased community respiration compared with photosynthesis. Extrapolation suggests that if this phenomenon is widespread, an increase of about 1.8 Gt over the 1990's net annual atmospheric accumulation rate of 3.2 Gt might result. Since the IPCC models of future climate change do not include such biological feedbacks, they may thus seriously underestimate the future rise in temperature and its consequences. 5. Thematic implications: we do not know if our Faustian bargain can be renegotiated; our political and social institutions are poorly equipped in knowledge and barely accept the importance of biosphere processes, and our scientific establishment is reductionist and conforms to the values of the rest of society. Current approaches to mitigation of climate change attend only to carbon release from human institutions, with little or no reference to natural systems. The future is exceptionally uncertain.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2010	55			1			175	187		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02381.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02381.x													WOS:000273687100010

The crater, which is about 30 m deep, is located at 2108 m a.s.l., and is surrounded by subalpine coniferous forest where the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C. The ground ice survived in summer mainly because cold air blew down through voids between andesite blocks composing the crater wall. The ice remained throughout 2009, although it melted completely in September 2010. In 2010, a crater lake appeared in May and disappeared in early August. This survival period of the lake was probably much longer than in other years. We consider that the melting of ground ice was promoted by the long-lasting lake having a slightly positive temperature which contacted the ice directly.																			0022-135X	1884-0884					2012	121	2			SI		359	366		10.5026/jgeography.121.359	http://dx.doi.org/10.5026/jgeography.121.359													WOS:000446272600010
J	Malta, EJ; Verschuure, JM; Nienhuis, PH				Malta, EJ; Verschuure, JM; Nienhuis, PH			Regulation of spatial and seasonal variation of macroalgal biomass in a brackish, eutrophic lake	HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH												Processes leading to biomass variation of Ulva were investigated at two contrasting sites in the eutrophic Veerse Meer (The Netherlands). Ulva species dominated at the Middelplaten site, while at the Kwistenburg site a mixture of Ulva spp. and Chaetomorpha linum dominated. Total summer macroalgal biomass was higher at Middelplaten than at Kwistenburg (282 and 79 g DW m(-2), respectively). Growth rates of Ulva spp. were high at both sites in May 1992 (cage mean 0.28-0.30 day(-1)), but quickly dropped to lower values (0.05-0.10 day(-1)). In May, growth rates were significantly highest at Kwistenburg, while during the rest of the season growth rates were similar for both sites. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, light attenuation, phytoplankton and nutrient concentrations did not differ between sites. The relation between variation in Ulva spp. growth rates and environmental parameters was analysed using stepwise multiple regression, showing that light and temperature were the main variables regulating Ulva spp. growth rates. As Ulva growth rates were similar for both sites but biomass was much lower at Kwistenburg it was concluded that a large amount of produced biomass was lost at Kwistenburg. Although the exact reason for this remains unclear, it seems most likely that transport of macroalgae by wind and waves is a very important factor. This study shows the importance of simultaneously measuring growth rates and biomass at a high temporal resolution to reveal the mechanisms responsible for spatial variation in macroalgal biomass in shallow coastal areas.

Mercury Accumulation in Sediment Cores from Three Washington State Lakes: Evidence for Local Deposition from a Coal-Fired Power Plant	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Mercury accumulation rates measured in age-dated sediment cores were compared at three Washington state lakes. Offutt Lake and Lake St. Clair are located immediately downwind (18 and 28 km, respectively) of a coal-fired power plant and Lake Sammamish is located outside of the immediate area of the plant (110 km). The sites immediately downwind of the power plant were expected to receive increased mercury deposition from particulate and reactive mercury not deposited at Lake Sammamish. Mercury accumulation in cores was corrected for variable sedimentation, background, and sediment focusing to estimate the anthropogenic contribution (Hg-A,Hg-F). Results indicated lakes immediately downwind of the power plant contained elevated HgA, F levels with respect to the reference lake. Estimated fluxes to Lake Sammamish were compared to measured values from a nearby mercury wet deposition collector to gauge the efficacy of the core deconstruction techniques.

J	Zelenskaya, LA				Zelenskaya, L. A.			Ecology of Slaty-Backed Gull (Larus schistisagus) Breeding on Kronotskoe Lake, Kamchatka Peninsula	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The slaty-backed gull population of Kronotskoe Lake has not been subjected to anthropogenic impact for many decades. The number and distribution of the breeding colonies of the slaty-backed gulls on the islands of this largest freshwater reservoir of the Kamchatka Peninsula are presented. Data on the breeding phenology, the seasonal dynamics of the food composition of breeding gulls, the foraging distance, and breeding success are considered. These data are compared to the results obtained earlier for Kuril'skoe Lake. Both gull populations are unique in that they are the only freshwater colonies within the distribution range of this marine species. The breeding success of the slaty-backed gulls on Kronotskoe Lake suffers from predation, both intra- and interspecific, in the latter case from brown bears and sea eagles. The hatching period and the fledging time of chicks in this population are both shifted to the end of summer, when gulls have the most abundant food available within the lake area, which increases successful survival of the fledglings. Despite considerable differences between the ecosystems of Kronotskoe Lake and Kuril'skoe Lake, there are several common features in the diets of the gull populations living on the lakes: (1) Despite the fact that gulls perform foraging flights to the sea coast, they only take fish and almost never collect marine invertebrates there. (2) Nearly half of all food items are taken within a 40-km distance from the colony. (3) During the growth period of chicks, gulls from both lakes rely on salmonids (anadromous in Kuril'skoe Lake, resident in Kronotskoe Lake) that they hunt in the lakes near their colonies.					; Zelenskaya, Larisa/IQT-2444-2023	Zelenskaya, Larisa/0009-0006-0184-7854; 													1062-3590	1026-3470				DEC	2017	44	8					860	874		10.1134/S1062359017080179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359017080179													WOS:000426105900004

Limnological parameters and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) juveniles and adults were monitored from 1969-1976 to determine if increasing the supply of inorganic nutrients in an ultraoligotrophic lake would increase production at succeeding trophic levels. Rates of change and linkages between different elements of the food chain leading to juvenile sockeye salmon were identified. During fertilized years mean summer primary production increased five-fold, zooplankton standing stock increased 9 times, the percentage survival from estimated potential egg deposition to juvenile sockeye increased 2.6 times, while mean stock size of adult sockeye increased from < 50,000 to > 360,000. Adult sockeye returning to an adjacent untreated lake increased in abundance. The data for the 8 yr period supported the initial hypothesis, but the dominant processes affecting production and interrelationships between different trophic levels in different years remained masked.																									1978	35	12					1580	1596		10.1139/f78-248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-248													WOS:A1978GD27100008

Seasonal habitat use of white sucker Catostomus commersonii in a small Boreal lake	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												White sucker (Catostomus commersonii) is a large-bodied benthic fish species that is found across a broad geographic region in North America. Often overlooked, white suckers are an integral component of aquatic ecosystems in their role as the dominant nearshore benthivore in many lakes. Few detailed field investigations on habitat use and thermal occupancy of white sucker exist, limiting our ability to predict the risk of habitat loss from development and climate warming for this cool-water species. Here we investigated seasonal depth, temperature and spatial occupancy patterns of white suckers in a lake located in northern Ontario, Canada. Using a combination of positioning acoustic telemetry and environmental data, we determined depth and space use patterns, seasonal temperature preference indices, and the affinity of white sucker to the lake bottom (i.e., benthic habitat) over a year long period. We found that the white suckers were consistently observed in shallow waters (< 10 m depth) and near the lake bottom across all seasons but were positioned slightly deeper in the winter. The tagged white suckers showed a strong temperature selection preference for thermal habitat between 10 and 16 degrees C during the open-water seasons and tended to avoid cold (< 6 degrees C) thermal habitat. Space use patterns, calculated using kernel utilization distributions, and daily movement rates were surprisingly consistent across all seasons, with regular occupancy of only some nearshore areas. This study highlights a highly restrictive pattern of habitat use by white sucker that is consistent across seasons, suggesting that this generalist species may be more vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance than previously thought.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2024	107	12			SI		1529	1545		10.1007/s10641-024-01581-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-024-01581-8		AUG 2024											WOS:001292645400001

The "Roxolany Tephra' (Ukraine) - new evidence for an origin from Ciomadul volcano, East Carpathians	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												We present major element glass data and correlations for the Roxolany Tephra' - a so far geochemically unconstrained volcanic ash layer previously described in last glacial (Marine Isotope Stage 2) loess deposits of the Roxolany loess-palaeosol complex in south-west Ukraine. This exceptionally well-preserved, 2-3-cm-thick tephra layer is characterized by a rhyolitic glass composition that is comparable to that of proximal tephra units from Ciomadul volcano in the East Carpathians, central Romania. The chemistry particularly matches that of the final Latest St. Ana Phreatomagmatic Activity pyroclastic fall unit of St. Ana crater that is radiocarbon dated in the proximal Moho coring site (MOH-2) to 29.6 +/- 0.62 cal ka BP. The age of the tephra correlative agrees with the newest radiocarbon and infrared optically stimulated luminescence age constraints from overlying palaeosols and tephra-embedding loess of the Roxolany sequence, respectively, which place the tephra between ca. 33 and 24 cal ka BP, and thus confirm the long-debated chronostratigraphy of this important environmental archive. The occurrence of a distal Ciomadul tephra ca. 350km east of its source indicates great potential for further tephra and cryptotephra findings from this volcanic complex in the south-eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea region.

J	SIMON, E; MERO, F				SIMON, E; MERO, F			THE SALINIZATION MECHANISM OF LAKE KINNERET	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The source of brine that has caused the salinization of Lake Kinneret is still disputed. Another controversial issue is whether the driving head of the brine is freshwater dependent, or whether it has a driving head of its own. This paper describes the various hypotheses regarding the origin of the brine and the salinization mechanism in the lake. Although the question of brine origin remains unanswered, statistical analyses (e.g. linear correlations) of the annual chloride contribution to the lake (SBB), and annual water inflows from Lake Kinneret saline springs and ground water (QB), indicate that these parameters are inversely related. This phenomenon means that the fresh water in the aquifers draining into Lake Kinneret has a regulating effect on brine discharges. The aquifers should therefore not be overutilized, as the hydraulic head acts as ballast controlling emergence of the brine in the lake shores and bottom. Although developed for Lake Kinneret, the identification procedure of the QB-SBB relationship may be used for other lakes, contributing towards a better understanding of the mechanisms governing their salinization.																			0022-1694					OCT	1992	138	3-4					327	343		10.1016/0022-1694(92)90124-E	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(92)90124-E													WOS:A1992JW46700001

JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												We tested, in the laboratory, the influence of light intensity, temperature, and phosphorus (P) supply on fatty acid (FA) concentrations of four freshwater algae: the green algae Scenedesmus quadricauda (Turpin) Breb. and Chlamydomonas globosa J. Snow, the cryptophyte Cryptomonas ovata Ehrenb., and the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana Kutz. We investigated the main and interactive effects of two variables on algal FA concentrations (i.e., light intensity and P supply or temperature and P supply). Interactive effects of light intensity and P supply were most pronounced in C. meneghiniana, but were also found in S. quadricauda and C. ovata. Changes in several saturated and unsaturated FA concentrations with light were more distinct in the low-P treatments than in the high-P treatments. Interactive effects of temperature and P supply on various FA concentrations were observed in all four species, but there was no consistent pattern. In lake ecosystems, P limitation often coincides with high light intensities and temperatures in summer. Therefore, it is important to examine how combinations of these environmental conditions affect FA concentrations of primary producers that are important sources of FAs for higher trophic levels.

J	Pearson, EJ; Juggins, S; Farrimond, P				Pearson, Emma J.; Juggins, Steve; Farrimond, Paul			Distribution and significance of long-chain alkenones as salinity and temperature indicators in Spanish saline lake sediments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We investigated relationships between sedimentary solvent-extractable long-chain alkenone (LCA) concentration and composition and environmental factors in a suite of endorheic lakes from inland Spain. LCAs were found in 14 of the 54 lakes examined, with concentrations comparable with those from previously published lacustrine settings. The composition of LCAs in our sites, however, contrast from the majority of those previously reported from take environments; in our study the tri-unsaturated component is the most abundant component at most sites where LCAs are detected, and C-38:3 is the most abundant LCA in the majority of sites. LCA occurrence appears to be restricted to brackish-hypersaline sites and C-37 LCAs are absent above a salinity of similar to 40 g L-1 suggesting a salinity control on LCA-producing organisms in these sites. Low concentrations Of C-37 LCA components means U-37(k) and U-37(k') temperature indices are generally not applicable. Instead we find good relationships between C-38 components and (in particular mean autumn) temperature and the strongest LCA-temperature relationships are found when using a combination of all C-37 and C-38 compounds. We propose a new alkenone temperature index for lakes with elevated salinity and where the C-38 components dominate the LCA distributions. This is expressed as U-3738(k) = 0.0464 x MAutAT - 0.867 (r(2) = 0.80, n = 13). In this paper, we provide the first account of sedimentary LCA distributions from lakes in inland Spain, extending the range of environments within which these compounds have been found and highlighting their significance as indicators of both salinity and temperature in saline, endorheic lake environments. This has important implications for extending the potential role of LCAs as palaeoclimatic indicators in lacustrine environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	KERFOOT, WC; PETERSON, C				KERFOOT, WC; PETERSON, C			PREDATORY COPEPODS AND BOSMINA - REPLACEMENT CYCLES AND FURTHER INFLUENCES OF PREDATION UPON PREY REPRODUCTION	ECOLOGY												In the bays of large lakes, populations of cladocerans and rotifers often appear to undergo seasonal morphological changes. In the past, these transformations were thought to reflect phenotypic plasticity within lineages (cyclomorphosis). In Union Bay populations of Bosmina, the transformations clearly involve regular seasonal replacements (termed taxocene cycles) by genetically different lineages. In Union Bay, Washington, USA, selective predation by both visually foraging fish and blindly grasping predatory copepods, combined with reproductive and competitive costs associated with prey defense, creates a spatial and temporal environment where the seasonally fluctuating selective regimes exceed the ability of individual lineages to adapt phenotypically to changes. Genetically different clones, some derived from biologically isolated populations, rapidly replace one another in time and space. While most clones remain extant throughout the year, even times of relatively small density differences are punctuated by rapid clonal replacement. Detailed study of the clonal replacements disclosed the following: phenotypes generally fall into 3 modal classes (short-, intermediate- and long-featured forms); the shorts and longs are separate species; and intermediates are not the results of crosses between extremes, but are heterogeneous mixtures of convergent lines derived from the other 2 species. While there is limited sexual activity, and certainly opportunity for mating between clones, there is no electrophoretic evidence for crossing. The distinctive nature of certain secondary sexual features seems associated with mate choice and aids the isolation of various lineages. The frequency of sexual activity, the evolution of the brood chamber and the transparent ephippium, all appear intimately associated with predation and the selective advantage of rapid reproductive responses.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1980	61	2					417	431		10.2307/1935198	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1935198													WOS:A1980KD17300023
J	Sayer, CD				Sayer, Carl D.			Conservation of aquatic landscapes: ponds, lakes, and rivers as integrated systems	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Although many wetlands have been lost, the European lowlands still hold amosaic of aquatic habitats covering rivers, lakes, ponds, ditches, springs, and swamps. To effectively conserve this diverse and important resource, both scientific studies and management and restoration activities need to focus on all of the watery patches in the landscape and in turn on the linkages between them. Over recent years, catchment and landscape-based approaches to aquatic conservation have been on the rise. However, perhaps driven by a lack of legislative drivers, there remains a tendency to neglect small lakes, ponds, and headwater streams. With consideration of the current conservation scene in the UK, and using a small lowland river catchment (River Glaven, eastern England) as a case study, this paper outlines the strong need for an integrated approach to aquatic conservation that sees rivers, lakes, and ponds as habitat networks. It is proposed that river restoration needs to more fully embrace standing water habitats on floodplains (backwaters and ponds), frequently missing components in regulated rivers. Equally, is it argued that aquatic conservation strategies should focus more strongly on headwater areas where protecting/restoring networks of farmland ponds, ditches, and small streams should increase connectivity for aquatic species, while moderating floods and improving water quality for receiving systems. In this way, aquatic conservation should become a much more effective and sustainable activity with positive ecological consequences that cascade downstream and into the coastal zone.

In total, 247 clones were screened by RFLP and 60 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained, belonging to the following groups: Proteobacteria (8% alpha subdivision, 21% beta subdivision, and 1% gamma subdivision), Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) (54%), Actinobacteria (4%), Planctomycetes (2%), Verrucomicrobia (2%), Fibrobacteres (1%) and Eukaryotic chroloplast (3%), respectively. The high dominance of CFB distinguished the Mount Everest waters from other mountain lakes. The highest bacterial abundance and diversity occurred in the open moraine lake at 5152 m, and the lowest in the glacial meltwater at 6350 m. Low temperature at high altitude is considered to be critical for component dominancy. At the same altitude, nutrient availability plays a role in regulating population structure. Our results also show that the bacteria in Mount Everest may be derived from different sources.					liu, yongqin/LFF-8837-2024; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; Zeng, Yonghui/C-5663-2008	Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; ZENG, YONGHUI/0000-0001-7483-5017													0378-1097	1574-6968				DEC	2006	265	1					98	105		10.1111/j.1574-6968.2006.00477.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2006.00477.x								17107422					WOS:000241893800014

Midge-inferred temperature reconstructions and vegetation change over the last ∼15,000 years from Trout Lake, northern Yukon Territory, eastern Beringia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Two cores from Trout Lake, northern Yukon, yielded quantitative estimates of summer air temperatures using fossil midge larvae. Warming began around 14,400 cal yr BP, with inferred mean July air temperatures reaching values warmer than present by 12,800 cal yr BP. A 1 degrees C cooling from 12,200 to 11,200 cal yr BP closely corresponds with the Younger Dryas chronozone. A broad temperature maximum occurred between 10,800 and 9,800 cal yr BP, with mean July air temperature about 2.2 degrees C warmer than present. This represents an early Holocene thermal maximum and coincides with increased organic content of the sediment. Both the shallow- and deep-water cores show similar temperature trends for their overlapping periods. The inferred rise in mean July air temperature at 14,200 cal yr BP coincides with a shift in vegetation from an herb- to shrub-dominated landscape. In contrast, the increase in Alnus pollen at 6,400 cal yr BP does not coincide with a change in temperature, but may be a response to a rise in precipitation.					; Cwynar, Les/I-4214-2012; Rees, Andrew/Q-1417-2017	Vermaire, Jesse/0000-0002-9921-6148; Rees, Andrew/0000-0003-4026-7765													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2012	48	1			SI		133	146		10.1007/s10933-012-9612-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9612-7													WOS:000304566900010

Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating was used to evaluate the age of the most distinct marginal moraines by measuring the degree of surface weathering on boulders. The lithostratigraphy of lake sediments was analysed in a core from Dalevatnet in order to correlate this stratigraphy with the marginal moraines in the catchment area of the lake and reconstruct the early-Holocene history of Grovabreen. The lake catchment was deglaciated at 10,750 cal. yr BP. Two readvances of an outlet glacier in Fagredalen were dated to between 10,340 and 9960 cal. yr BP, correlated with the two-peaked Erdalen Event. A readvance shortly after 8450 cal. yr BP can most probably be correlated with the 8200 cal. yr BP Finse Event.					aa, a/LIG-6284-2024														0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2019	29	2					187	196		10.1177/0959683618810392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618810392													WOS:000459887400001

While much of the phosphorus loading into the lake prior to 1972 was caused by point-source pollution, approximately 88% to 93% of current loading comes from nonpoint sources, of which agriculture is the dominant land use. A reduction target of 860 metric tons, or 40% of the total phosphorus spring loading in 2008, has been set with the expectation that such a reduction could limit the size and associated impact of HABs in 9 out of every 10 years. We review the effectiveness of recommended practices aimed at reducing phosphorus loss in agriculture and pair this knowledge with behavioral data on likely adoption to identify how best to achieve the reduction target. The data suggests that the target is feasible as a majority of the farming population is willing to consider many of the recommended practices. However, increases in adoption over time have been minimal, and farmers will need better cost-benefit information, site-specific decision support tools, and technical assistance in order to more rapidly adopt and execute the placement of recommended practices. A combination of voluntary and mandatory approaches may be needed, but policies and programs promoting voluntary adoption should be designed to better target known barriers and maximize voluntary program effectiveness.

Body size scaling of space use in coastal pike (Esox lucius) in brackish lagoons of the southern Baltic Sea	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The northern pike (Esox lucius) has been intensively studied in terms of behaviour due to its relevance to fisheries and its importance for structuring fish communities in freshwater ecosystems. However, little is known about the behaviour of coastal pike living in brackish lagoons. Freshwater ecosystems, particularly lakes and small rivers, are usually finite in space, which can limit the expression of space use as a function of body size and other traits. Better understanding the spatial behaviour shown by coastal pike in extended brackish lagoons and its relationship to body size, sex, season and vulnerability to fishing is an important step to further our knowledge on brackish pike populations and can inform management. Here, we present two years of acoustic telemetry data acquired on a large sample of coastal pike (n = 210) with an extended size range (480 to 1.210 mm total length) inhabiting six interconnected coastal lagoons bordered by the islands of Fischland-Darss-Zingst, Hiddensee, Rugen and Usedom in the Baltic Sea (area ca. 1.200 km2). Overall, the space used by coastal pike (50 % and 95 % utilization distribution, UD) scaled positively with body size, with larger fish using significantly more space after controlling for co-variates, but this effect was mainly observed at the between lagoon level. Within a given lagoon, body size scaling of space use was only observed for the 50 % UD of males. We also found the ratio of 50 % UD on 95 % UD to scale negatively with size, meaning that larger-sized pike used areas out of their core ranges more intensively regardless of sex. Space use also differed between seasons, with activity spaces being elevated in spring likely due to spawning migrations and increased reproduction-related activity. Study design was an important co-variate for our space use proxies, as we collected proportionally more data on pike that used less space, but fish recaptured by fisheries did not differ in space use from those that were not recaptured. All space use proxies were found to be repeatable, suggesting an influence of pike personalities on their individual spatial behaviour. This study provides an updated understanding of spatial behaviour in Brackish water-adapted pike and its ties to body size, highlighting how body size in interaction with biotic and abiotic factors drives space use patterns.

However, biogeo-chemical data from High Arctic freshwaters are limited, and mostly restricted to the short, ice-free period. We sampled four coastal lakes in Stuckberry Valley (82 degrees 54 ' N, 66 degrees 56 ' W) before the onset of spring melting in 2017, 2018 and 2019, to assess biogeochemical gradients in their water columns and characteristics of their surface sediments. Despite their proximity, there were large differences in limnological properties. The two shallower lakes closer to the ocean were oxygen deficient, whereas the two deeper, more distant lakes were more oxygenated. There were pronounced vertical gradients in major ions, metals, and nutrients that suggested large differences in the extent of anaerobic microbial processes among the lakes. Morphometry and dissolved oxygen were the overriding determinants of biogeochemical differences rather than position along this short ocean-inland gradient. The diversity of lim-nological conditions, and the sensitivity of these characteristics to changes in ice cover, under-lines the need for further study of under-ice processes in extreme northern lakes.																				2368-7460				DEC	2021	7	4					813	831		10.1139/as-2020-0038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2020-0038													WOS:000950582300003

Lake trout otolith chronologies as multidecadal indicators of high-latitude freshwater ecosystems	POLAR BIOLOGY												High-latitude ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to long-term climate change, yet continuous, multidecadal indicators by which to gauge effects on biology are scarce, especially in freshwater environments. To address this issue, dendrochronology (tree-ring analysis) techniques were applied to growth-increment widths in otoliths from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from the Chandler Lake system, Alaska (68.23A degrees N, 152.70A degrees W). All otoliths were collected in 1987 and exhibited highly synchronous patterns in growth-increment width. Increments were dated, the widths were measured, and age-related growth declines were removed using standard dendrochronology techniques. The detrended time series were averaged to generate an annually resolved chronology, which continuously spanned 1964-1984. The chronology positively and linearly correlated with August air temperature over the 22-year interval (p < 0.01), indicating that warmer summers were beneficial for growth, perhaps by increasing fish metabolic rate or lake productivity. Given the broad distribution of lake trout within North America, this study suggests that otolith chronologies could be used to examine responses between freshwater ecosystems and environmental variability across a range of temporal and spatial scales.

Field campaigns have been performed on Lake Erken in Sweden during the summer of 1997. Water samples have been collected and analysed in laboratory. Continuously measured variables from a boat have added a spatial dimension to the ground truth dataset. The data have been used to construct algorithms, based on remotely sensed data, for the retrieval of water quality parameters. The correlation between the continuous data and the collected CASI data has been investigated. Algorithms using both the point sampling results and the continuous data have been developed. Maps based on data from each instrument, showing the distribution of chlorophyll, are presented. Problems of having few water sampling stations, and the potential of using sub-water optics models are addressed as well. Tests were performed on MERIS bands and found useful for mapping chlorophyll and turbidity, and algorithms have been suggested for future use with MERIS. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF OXYGEN AND OTHER CHEMICAL GRADIENTS ON CILIATE DISTRIBUTION	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An investigation into the spatial distribution of hypolimnetic ciliates in 3 small eutrophic lakes during the period of summer stratification was carried out. Peak ciliate densities were found to occur at the oxic/anoxic boundary, ciliate numbers declining with increasing depth within the hypolimnion. The ciliates only occurred in aerobic water where O2 levels were less than about 0.5 mg/l. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the ciliates swim upwards under anaerobic conditions but swim rapidly downwards under aerobic conditions. Further laboratory experiments showed that although the bulk of the population occurred within anaerobic water, the hypolimnetic ciliates are aerobes and cannot survive indefinite anoxia. Despite the demonstrable toxicity of high levels of ammonia and sulfide, it was probably excessive distance from an available source of O2 that excluded the ciliates from the lowest levels of the hypolimnion. Possible mechanisms which allowed these aerobic ciliates to colonize anaerobic water are considered.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	124	2					177	188		10.1007/BF00006799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006799													WOS:A1985AKJ4400009

In this study, we used pollen and other multi-proxy analyses of the sediments from Xingyun Lake in central Yunnan Plateau to reconstruct the history of land use and ecosystem dynamics during the last 3,200 years. The pollen results indicate that the vegetation became more open gradually and many secondary forests began to grow during the last 100 years. During the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), the vegetation is dominated by broad-leaved trees, while during the Little Ice Age (LIA) the broad-leaved trees declined but Picea/Abies expanded. Human land use has impacted on the regional vegetation and landscape since 50 CE; large-scale human land use occurred after 750 CE. The sediment accumulation rate (SAR), pollen record, and C-14 age offsets reveal that soil erosion is well correlated with human activity and changes in vegetation cover. Before 750 CE, soil erosion was probably limited, but after 750 CE it increased drastically as a result of human activity, and then decreased during the last 100 years. According to the results of the redundancy analysis (RDA), we conclude that climate had an important impact on the regional vegetation, and the late Holocene vegetation changes of Xingyun Lake catchment were mainly influenced by temperature.					; Chen, Xuemei/KCL-6714-2024; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Zhou, Aifeng/C-5881-2013; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Chen, Jianhui/A-5340-2011; Zhang, Jiawu/C-8633-2011	Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; Zhou, Aifeng/0000-0001-8349-8585; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2022	211								105973	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105973	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105973													WOS:000790442900002

In this paper, a 1 year water quality survey was conducted around the lake and statistical analysis tools were used to characterize the variations of organic pollutants. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) confirm the seasonal and spatial variations of surface water quality in Lake Taihu. Surface water quality is better during the wet season and worse downstream during the dry season. The dissolved organic matter was further analyzed using a parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model with three-dimensional excitation-emission fluorescence matrices. Four components were extracted from the fluorescence data, namely, two autochthonous biodegradation products (Cl: amino acids, C4: protein-like materials) and two humic-like substances (C2: from microbial processing, C3: terrestrial). Cl and C4 were dominant in the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorophores; this result is similar to those of other inland water bodies in China. The CDOM fluorophores showed similar seasonal and spatial variations with common water quality indices, with the exception of the seasonal responses of C2 in winter. Bivariance correlations between the organic and nutrient concentrations and the fluorescence intensities of the CDOM fluorophores imply possible common sources of the different contaminants. This paper exemplifies advanced statistical methods as a useful tool in understanding the behavior of contaminants in inland fresh water systems.

Threat of land subsidence in and around Kolkata City and East Kolkata Wetlands, West Bengal, India	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												This paper attempts to estimate the possible rate of land subsidence of Kolkata City including Salt Lake City and the adjoining East Kolkata Wetlands located at the lower part of the deltaic alluvial plain of South Bengal basin. Demand of groundwater for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes has increased clue to rapid urbanization. The subsurface geology consists of Quaternary sediments comprising a succession of clay, silty clay and sand of various grades. Groundwater occurs mostly under confined condition except in those places where the top aquitard has been obliterated due to the scouring action of past channels. Currently, the piezometric head shows a falling trend and it may be accelerated due to further over-withdrawal of groundwater resulting in land subsidence. The estimated mean land subsidence rate is 13.53 mm/year and for 1 m drop in the piezometric head, the mean subsidence is 3.28 cm. The surface expression of the estimated land subsidence is however, cryptic because of a time lag between the settlement of the thick low-permeable aquitard at the top and its surface expression. Therefore, groundwater of the cities and wetland areas should be developed cautiously based on the groundwater potential to minimize the threat of land subsidence.					; SAHU, PAULAMI/AAC-4740-2020	Sahu, Paulami/0000-0002-0454-5054; 													0253-4126	0973-774X				JUN	2011	120	3					435	446		10.1007/s12040-011-0077-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-011-0077-2													WOS:000293098500009

The current study aimed at ascertaining the specific lake characteristics regulating TPacc. Moreover, we were interested whether NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation), a proxy of climatic forcing, can explain variability in TPacc, additionally to that ascribed to lake characteristics. Sediment cores were obtained from 21 Finnish lakes, subject to radiometric dating and measurements of TP concentrations. Principal components (PCs) were generated using lake characteristics that are usually included into the modelling of TPacc (e.g. lake area, lake depth, catchment area, P inflow) but also the parameters that the classical models usually missed (e.g. anoxic factor). We used significant principal components (PCs), specific combinations of lake characteristics and monthly NAO values as predictors of TPacc. Lake characteristics explained the bulk of TPacc variability. The most influential factors (positive drivers) behind TPacc included PC1 (representing mainly deep lakes), PC2 (small lakes with high levels of anoxia and water column stability), PC3 (productive lakes with large catchment area and short water residence time), PC4 (lakes with high water column stability, low anoxic factor and relatively high sediment focusing) and PC5 (lakes with high levels of P inflow, anoxia and long water residence time). Additionally, we found a potential negative effect of NAO in October on the annual TPacc. This NAO was significantly positively related to temperatures in surface and near-bottom water layer (also their difference) in autumn, suggesting the possible implications for the internal P dynamics. Increased mineralization of organic matter is the most likely explanation for the reduced TPacc associated with NAO-driven water temperature increase. The analysis presented here contributes to the knowledge of the factors controlling P retention. Moreover, this spatially and temporally comprehensive sediment data can potentially be a valuable source for modelling climate change implications.

Growth rates of bacteria in diluted natural samples were determined for epilimnetic and metalimnetic bacterial populations during the summers of 1982 and 1983. Exponential growth was observed in these diluted samples, with increases in cell numbers of 30-250%. No lag was observed in bacterial growth in 14 of 16 experiments. Correlation of bacterial growth rates to corresponding rates of thymidine incorporation by natural samples produced a conversion factor of 2.2 .times. 1018 cells produced/mol of thymidine incorporated. The mass of the average bacterial cell in the lake was 1.40 .times. 10-14 .+-. 0.05 .times. 10-14 g of C cell-1. Doubling times of natural bacteria calculated from thymidine incorporation rates and in situ cell numbers ranged from 0.35-12.00 days (median, 1.50 days). Bacterial production amounted to 66.7 g of C m-2 from April through Sept., accounting for 29.4% of total (primary plus bacterial) production during this period. The vertical and seasonal distribution of bacterial production in Little Crooked Lake was strongly influenced by the distribution of primary production. From April-Sept. 1983, the depth of maximum bacterial production rates in the water column was related to the depth of high rates of primary production. On a seasonal basis, primary production increased steadily from May-Sept., and bacterial production increased from May-Aug. and then decreased in Sept.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1985	49	3					492	500		10.1128/AEM.49.3.492-500.1985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.49.3.492-500.1985								16346743					WOS:A1985ACS8200004
J	Echevarría, G; González, N				Echevarria, Gabriela; Gonzalez, Nirson			FISH TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY IN MESOHABITATS OF THE RIVER KAKADA, CAURA NATIONAL PARK, VENEZUELA	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The Caura National Park encompasses the entire basin of the River Caura, one of the most biodiverse hydrographic systems of Venezuela, yet the ichthyofauna, particularly in the upper basin, has been poorly studied. In this study, the taxonomic and functional diversity of fishes in mesohabitats of the River Kakada, a main tributary of the upper River Caura in Southern Venezuela, are described. The fishes were sampled in four mesohabitat types with seines during four different occasions, representing the hydrological seasons of rising waters, high waters, falling waters and low waters. Functional diversity indices were calculated based on four traits: size, trophic guild, mouth orientation and body shape. A total of 56 fish species were registered. There were significant differences in species composition of the fish assemblages and their taxonomic diversities among mesohabitats and across hydrological seasons, and the taxonomic and functional diversities were higher in the mesohabitats with presence of riparian forest. However, there were no seasonal variations in functional composition or functional diversities. The rocky substrates had unique assemblages of habitat specialist species with a particular array of traits. On the other hand, the presence of riparian forest and more structurally complex substrates favors the coexistence of a high diversity of fishes with a variety of trait combinations, whereas the seasonal fluctuations in the water level might propitiate stochastic processes of dispersion and colonisation that generate variations in species composition and taxonomic diversity. Considering the spread of artisanal gold mines in the Caura National Park, the results of this investigation might serve as a reference for future studies that assess the impacts of the gold mining activities on the river integrity and their fish communities.

This study, which was commissioned by NASA headquarters, utilized satellite remote sensing data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite to investigate whether these changes in activity led to any short-term changes in water quality in the Great Lakes region by comparing 2020 data to a historic baseline. The water quality parameters examined included chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, water clarity, and harmful algal bloom (HAB) extent. These parameters were investigated in two Great Lakes basins which experience significant anthropogenic pressure: the western basin of Lake Erie (WBLE) and Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron (SBLH). TSS concentrations in April 2020 were below the historic baseline in both basins, and largely remained low until September. SBLH also experienced elevated CHL concentrations in April which persisted through the summer. Additionally, the WBLE HAB extent was down in 2020 after an early end to the growing season. However, this investigation found that the COVID-19 shutdowns were likely not a direct driver of these short-term anomalies. Instead, recent trends in the indicators and co-occurring anomalies in hydrological and meteorological conditions (e.g., lake temperature, river discharge, and wind speed) appeared to be more responsible for the detected water quality changes. Future work will investigate whether the shutdowns have a long-term or delayed impact on Great Lakes water quality.

Tarawera in 1886 represents a significant cultural and scientific event for New Zealand. This review utilises published and new observations, to reinterpret eruptive parameters encompassing the entirety of the eruption. The similar to 17 km eruptive fissure, active for 4+ hours, extends across Mt. Tarawera to the hydrothermally active Waimangu region. Correlating published observations of bed thickness, componentry and microtextures from Mt. Tarawera to new bed descriptions and granulometry for the Rotomahana-Waimangu rift segment allows for a re-assessment of eruption variations along the length of the fissure. Variably thick pyroclastic fall sequences at Mt. Tarawera contrast with the pyroclastic surges and an eruption plume that together deposited the 'Rotomahana Mud' erupted along the Rotomahana-Waimangu segment. Providing insight into pre-eruptive conditions, new mineral chemistry from Mt. Tarawera provides the first constraints on crystallisation pressures (<2 kbar), temperatures (<1100 degrees C), and magmatic water content (<2.8 wt%). Recalculated volumes indicate a bulk eruptive volume of 1.1-1.3 km(3), and a juvenile basalt volume of up to 0.67 km(3), which then lead to calculated discharge rates of 3.7 x 10(7)-7.8 x 10(7) kg s(-1) for the northern Mt. Tarawera segment of the fissure and 1.4-5.7 x 10(6) kg s(-1) for the Rotomahana segment.					; Carey, Rebecca/A-5381-2013; White, James/D-7751-2013; White, James Daniel Lee/D-7751-2013	Rowe, Michael/0000-0002-8052-2882; White, James Daniel Lee/0000-0002-2970-711X													0028-8306	1175-8791				JUL 3	2021	64	2-3			SI		296	319		10.1080/00288306.2021.1914118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2021.1914118		APR 2021											WOS:000646786600001

In a database that goes back to the fourteenth century 270 such events are reported, related to rock falls, rock avalanches, debris flows, quick clay slides, snow avalanches and submarine landslides. By far the most severe effects are related to rock avalanches impacting into water bodies setting off waves with near-field heights of several tens of meters and far-field heights locally exceeding 10 m. Consequently, the highest numbers of fatalities (283) are related to those events reaching up to 73 fatalities in a single event. Our database has the potential to aid prediction of future landslide-generated displacement waves and tsunamis in Norway. However, it became evident that detailed data comprising landslide type, landslide volume, wave heights around the water body, only exist for few events and it is needed to study in detail future events in order to build better data sets that might be used for empirical prediction of those secondary effects.					; Hermanns, Reginald/J-1418-2019	Oppikofer, Thierry/0000-0002-2274-5770; 															978-3-319-08660-6; 978-3-319-08659-0				2014							63	66		10.1007/978-3-319-08660-6_13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-08660-6_13													WOS:000359014100013

Using Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning To Assess Patterns of Areal Change in Waterbodies across the Contiguous United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Lake and reservoir surface areas are an important proxy for freshwater availability. Advancements in machine learning (ML) techniques and increased accessibility of remote sensing data products have enabled the analysis of waterbody surface area dynamics on broad spatial scales. However, interpreting the ML results remains a challenge. While ML provides important tools for identifying patterns, the resultant models do not include mechanisms. Thus, the "black-box" nature of ML techniques often lacks ecological meaning. Using ML, we characterized temporal patterns in lake and reservoir surface area change from 1984 to 2016 for 103,930 waterbodies in the contiguous United States. We then employed knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML) to classify all waterbodies into seven ecologically interpretable groups representing distinct patterns of surface area change over time. Many waterbodies were classified as having "no change" (43%), whereas the remaining 57% of waterbodies fell into other groups representing both linear and nonlinear patterns. This analysis demonstrates the potential of KGML not only for identifying ecologically relevant patterns of change across time but also for unraveling complex processes that underpin those changes.

The analysis of residue ratios, within each species and between, allowed an immediate recognition of rising and falling trends of contamination with a high degfree of confidence. This improvement over the conventional method of monitoring 1 sp. over several years was accomplished with little effort in sampling and chemical contaminant analysis. The technique exploited the unique biological relationship of the lamprey and its host and was also based on the significnalty shorter lifespan of the (adult) lamprey compared to that of the host. Rising trends in PCB [polychlorinated biphenyl] and DDE contamination and declining trends for the levels of DDT, dieldrin, endrin, chlordane, hexachlorobenzene [fungicide], hepatachlorepoxide and .alpha.-BHC were observed in 1978.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1982	39	4					571	579		10.1139/f82-081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f82-081													WOS:A1982NL14200006

Studies on cyanobacteria and their potential toxicity have been very scarce in Chile and have been limited to lakes of the central zone. Recently, North-Patagonian lakes, although characterized by their low nutrient concentration and low productivity, revealed also the presence of blooms of cyanobacteria, mainly constituted by Microcystis and Dolichospermum species (former Anabaena sp.). To identify potential toxicological risk associated to these blooms, six North Patagonian lakes (Lakes Caburgua, Villarrica, Calafquen, Panguipulli, Ranco, and Puyehue) were sampled during the summer period and screened for the presence of cyanobacteria and different toxins. Our results revealed for the first time the presence of microcystins in all studied lakes, whereas other toxins such as cylindrospermopsin, saxitoxin, and anatoxin were negative for all sites. By applying a genomic approach, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was found in one lake (Lake Ranco) constituting the first report of this cyanobacterium in a Chilean lake. This study highlights the effectiveness of molecular methods as a first approach to describe cyanobacteria and their potential cyanotoxins in Chilean North-Patagonian lakes.					; Leão, Pedro/E-1630-2011; Vasconcelos, Vitor/A-8933-2008; NIMPTSCH, JORGE/O-4030-2018; Nimptsch, Jorge/B-8638-2008; Ramos, Vitor/A-4540-2011; Moreira, Cristiana/AAG-6828-2020	Castelo Branco, Raquel/0000-0001-6627-0140; Woelfl, Stefan/0000-0001-5580-2383; Moreira, Cristiana/0000-0003-0860-2949; Vasconcelos, Vitor/0000-0003-3585-2417; Leao, Pedro/0000-0001-5064-9164; Nimptsch, Jorge/0000-0001-5419-7361; Ramos, Vitor/0000-0002-5824-3633; 													1434-2944	1522-2632				APR	2016	101	1-2					57	68		10.1002/iroh.201401780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201401780													WOS:000373710700005

Intraspecific variation in migration timing of green sturgeon in the Sacramento River system	ECOSPHERE												Understanding movement patterns of anadromous fishes is critical to conservation and management of declining wild populations and preservation of habitats. Yet, the duration of observations for individual animals can constrain accurate descriptions of movements. In this study, we synthesized over a decade (2006-2018) of acoustic telemetry tracking observations of green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) in the Sacramento River system to describe major anadromous movement patterns. We observed that green sturgeon exhibited a unimodal in-migration during the spring months but had a bimodal distribution of out-migration timing, split between an "early" out-migration (32%) group during May-June, or, alternatively, holding in the river until a "late" out-migration (68%), November-January. Focusing on these out-migration groups, we found that river discharge, but not water temperature, may cue the timing of migration and that fish showed a tendency to maintain out-migration timing between subsequent spawning migration events.

Biases in lake water quality sampling and implications for macroscale research	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Growth of macroscale limnological research has been accompanied by an increase in secondary datasets compiled from multiple sources. We examined patterns of data availability in LAGOS-NE, a dataset derived from 87 sources, to identify biases in availability of lake water quality data and to consider how such biases might affect perceived patterns at a subcontinental scale. Of eight common water quality parameters, variables indicative of trophic state (Secchi, chlorophyll, and total P) were most abundant in terms of total observations, lakes sampled, and long-term records, whereas carbon variables (true color and dissolved organic carbon) were scarcest. Most data were collected during summer from larger (>= 20 ha) lakes over 1-3 yr. Approximately 80% of data for each variable is derived from similar to 20% of sampled lakes. Long-term (>= 20 yr) records were rare and spatially clustered. Data availability is linked to major management challenges (eutrophication and acid rain), citizen science, and a few programs that quantify C and N variables. Resampling exercises suggested that correcting for the surface area sampling bias did not substantially change statistical distributions of the eight variables. Further, estimating a lake's long-term median Secchi, chlorophyll, and total P using average record lengths had high uncertainty, but modest increases in sample size to > 5 yr yielded estimates with manageable error. Although the specific nature of sampling biases may vary among regions, we expect that they are widespread. Thus, large integrated datasets can and should be used to identify tendencies in how lakes are studied and to address these biases as part broad-scale limnological investigations.					; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020	Webster, Katherine/0000-0002-6009-0146; Collins, Sarah/0000-0001-5503-7386; Stanley, Emily/0000-0003-4922-8121; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2019	64	4					1572	1585		10.1002/lno.11136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11136													WOS:000474301200011

We present results of the lake restoration of shallow, subtropical Lake Wuli, China, conducted between 1999 and 2010. After restoration, annual average concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll a and the chemical oxygen demand declined significantly, though summer TP remained high. Suspended solids increased significantly over the years, whereas transparency decreased, though not significantly so. The contribution of cryptophytes to total phytoplankton biomass decreased, while the proportion of cyanobacteria, especially potentially N-2-fixing species, increased. Rotifers were superseded by crustaceans as the dominant taxon of the zooplankton community. Enhanced abundance of Daphnia spp., appearance of Leptodora kindti, and increased biomass ratios of zooplankton to phytoplankton, calanoids to cyclopoids, and nauplii to copepods in the post-restoration period indicate reduced fish predation and stronger top-down control of phytoplankton. However, the increase in non-algal turbidity, probably caused by the higher biomass of benthivorous fish, apparently prevented the re-establishment of submerged macrophyte communities. We conclude that removal of fish, particularly benthivorous species, will further improve water quality in this and other subtropical shallow lakes.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2013	718	1					59	71		10.1007/s10750-013-1603-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1603-9													WOS:000324636600005

Its breeding habitat is transforming under the impact of climate change. Here we report the outcome of an observation of a female freshwater Ladoga ringed seal (Pusa hispida ladogensis) and her pup during the 2020 breeding season, when less than 1% of Lake Ladoga was covered with ice. We located a newborn pup in a coastal zone of an island and tracked its survival on land using the camera trap method during daylight. Altogether, we captured 2978 photos, in which the seals were present in 637. The female nursed the pup at the birth site for 34 - 37 days, which is similar to the lactation period in lairs of the Arctic subspecies (36 - 41 days, 39 days on average). The female either stayed with the pup or spent time in prolonged aquatic bouts during the day. Percentage of suckling was in the range of 2.4% - 4.7% (mean 3.3%, SD = 1.1) on different days. Based on an additional video recording, we found that the pup's behaviour was characterized by a high level of vigilance in comparison with openly breeding phocid seals. This case study indicates that the ringed seal in Lake Ladoga is able to nurse pups on land from soon after birth to pre-weaning. However, breeding success in warm springs can be constrained by predator pressure.

Hearing Sensitivity of the Burbot	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Acoustic communication is central to the reproductive ecology of many fish species, particularly when conditions prevent the use of visual mating cues. The Burbot Lota lota is a freshwater codfish that spawns in a light-limited, under-ice environment. Both sexes possess swim bladder muscles, suggesting that both sexes engage in vocalization and that auditory cues are important to their mating system, but research on acoustic communication has been very limited in this species. In the current study we assessed the hearing sensitivity of Burbot from different size-classes. Burbot hearing was found to be more sensitive in juveniles than in adults, but across size-classes it was most sensitive at lower frequencies, which is similar to results with other codfishes and corresponds to the sounds produced by gadoids. Anthropogenic noise has the potential to disturb fish. The information gained in this study can be useful in assessing the impact of such noise, particularly under ice cover when Burbot are spawning. Further research is required to determine whether winter-based resource development activities that generate under-ice noise are disruptive to Burbot communication and reproduction.					; Johnston, Thomas/G-1809-2012; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012	Higgs, Dennis/0000-0002-0771-4642; Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV 1	2013	142	6					1699	1704		10.1080/00028487.2013.788559	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.788559													WOS:000327469700020

Exploring Great Lakes benthoscapes: can we visually delineate hypoxic habitats?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Benthic macroinvertebrate communities are useful indicators for biological assessment of environmental and anthropogenic stressors, but our ability to quantify benthic populations is constrained by small spatial scales of traditional grab sampling and labor-intensive processing. During the 2019 assessment of Lake Erie's benthic community we studied lake benthoscapes by enhancing the traditional collection of grabs at 68 stations with underwater imagery, water quality, and sediment nutrients data. Four major habitats were identified from video data including Dreissena aggregations, Hexagenia burrows, and biogenic structures ("chimneys" and "tubes"). All four habitats differed in near-bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, with the highest DO found above dreissenids and the lowest in chimney habitats. DO, turbidity, and chlorophyll concentration provided the largest contribution to the MaxEnt model and predicted benthoscape distribution. There was a significant separation of benthic species by selected benthoscapes confirmed by independent cluster analysis. Suitable habitat for Dreissena was limited to normoxic areas, and Hexagenia habitats to the western basin. The central basin, subject to summer hypoxia, was mostly characterized by tube and chimney habitats. The agreement among biological, video, and abiotic data confirmed that video analysis can provide a novel, quick, and reliable method to detect benthic habitats affected by periodic hypoxia.

To address these limitations, the decay and transport of human (BacH) and ruminant (BacR) fecal Bacteroidales 16S rRNA genetic markers in a drinking water source (Lake Radasjon in Sweden) were simulated using a microbiological model coupled to a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The microbiological model was calibrated using data from outdoor microcosm trials performed in March, August, and November 2010 to determine the decay of BacH and BacR markers in relation to traditional fecal indicators. The microcosm trials indicated that the persistence of BacH and BacR in the microcosms was not significantly different from the persistence of traditional fecal indicators. The modeling of BacH and BacR transport within the lake illustrated that the highest levels of genetic markers at the raw water intakes were associated with human fecal sources (on-site sewers and emergency sewer overflow). This novel modeling approach improves the interpretation of MST data, especially, when fecal pollution from the same host group is released into the water source from different sites in the catchment.

Structural Changes of Phyto- and Zooplankton under the Influence of Climate Change and Anthropogenic Load (Lake Baikal, Russia)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The results of a contemporary study of hydrochemical parameters, structure, and quantitative indicators of phyto- and zooplankton in the Maloe More Strait of Lake Baikal are presented. When comparing new data and those obtained in the 20th century, a number of changes are observed in the functioning of the phyto- and zooplankton of the strait in recent years, similar to other areas of the lake. The main rearrangements are noted for spring phytoplankton: interannual cyclical dynamics with the maximum development of large-cell diatoms of the Baikal complex is disturbed; the structure of dominant species has changed. Due to a sharp increase in the rotifer abundance, the zooplankton abundance in the pelagial has increased by an order of magnitude. In 2021, with the intensive vegetation of diatoms, all zooplankton groups were suppressed. In Mukhor Bay, the changes were associated with an increase in the rotifer abundance persisting until 2021. In 2021, a decrease in the total plankton abundance was noted, but the relative share of taxonomic groups did not change, and rotifers dominated.

These results from April through October for 1992 and 1993 were compared with other studies from the Great Lakes region. Across the 2-year sampling period rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax energy density decreased from April to June and July then significantly increased into September. Lake herring Coregonus artedii energy density was highest in June, decreased significantly by August and remained stable through October. Bloater C. hoyi energy density was lowest in July, then increased in August and early September before decreasing in late September. There were no significant differences in energy density between males and females for rainbow smelt and lake herring collected on the same date across sampling dates. However, bloater energy density was significantly higher for females than for males on two dates. Energy density estimates for bloater in Lake Superior were lower than those reported from Lake Michigan. Energy density values of rainbow smelt and lake herring fell within the range reported in Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario (rainbow smelt), and from two inland lakes in Minnesota and Lake Mendota, Wisconsin (bake herring). Percent dry weight was a good predictor of energy density (P < 0.001, r(2) = 0.92-0.99) for all three species for both years. Percent dry weight vs energy density was significantly different between years for bloater and lake herring, and was significantly different for all three species compared with populations in other lakes in the Great Lakes Region.																			0380-1330						1996	22	3					757	764		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70994-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70994-2													WOS:A1996VQ49100021
J	Watson, A				Watson, Andrew			Pioneering a Rural Identity on the Canadian Shield: Tourism, Household Economies, and Poor Soils in Muskoka, Ontario, 1870-1900	CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW												At the end of the nineteenth century, Euro-Canadians extended rural society into new frontier areas unsuited to agriculture. These efforts were informed by a perspective that conflated rural and agrarian - a perspective that continues to dominate historians' thinking about rural societies. The resettlement of Muskoka demonstrates how the Canadian Shield's poor soils forced pioneers to rethink these assumptions and, in places adjacent to the lakes, construct a rural identity based on a tourism economy. At the same time as backwoods settlers experimented with shorter-lived opportunities in the agro-forestry economy, settlers along the lakeshore embraced the opportunities of a largely forested landscape to sell accommodation, fresh foods, and services to summer visitors. The Muskoka story therefore sheds light on the critical role that local household economies played in supporting tourism, an aspect of tourism that historians have generally ignored. Furthermore, this case study offers new insights into the role that tourism played in crystallizing a specific type of rural identity. Rather than simply serving as a replacement, supplement, or challenge to an older farming or resource extraction economy, tourism defined Muskoka's social and economic identity from the earliest stages of resettlement.																			0008-3755	1710-1093				JUN	2017	98	2					261	293		10.3138/chr.3783	http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/chr.3783													WOS:000408120400003
J	Scott, JJ; Renaut, RW; Owen, RB				Scott, Jennifer J.; Renaut, Robin W.; Owen, R. Bernhart			Impacts of flamingos on saline lake margin and shallow lacustrine sediments in the Kenya Rift Valley	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Studies of modern. Holocene, and Pleistocene sediments around saline to hypersaline, alkaline Lake Bogoria and Lake Magadi show that evidence of flamingo activity in marginal areas of these lakes is nearly ubiquitous. Flamingos produce discrete structures such as webbed footprints (similar to 9 cm long, similar to 11 cm wide) and nest mounds (similar to 30 cm wide, similar to 20 cm high), and they also extensively rework sediments in delta front, delta plain, and shoreline areas. Large (similar to 0.5-2 cm in diameter), pinched, 'bubble pores' and ped-like mud clumps are formed by the trampling and churning of wet clay-rich sediments in these settings. Flamingo nest mounds, although superficially similar to some thrombolite mounds, are typically internally structure-less, unless formed on pre-existing sediments that preserve internal structures. The flamingo mounds consist of a dense, packed oval-shaped core, a surrounding 'body' of packed sediment, and an external layer with a ped-like texture of clumped mud. The nests may contain open holes from roots or feather shafts incorporated into the nest, and (or) burrows produced once the nests are abandoned. In areas with high densities of flamingos, lake margin sediments may be preferentially compacted, particularly at breeding sites, and become resistant to subaerial erosion and the effects of transgressive ravinement on time scales ranging from seasons to tens of thousands of years. The relatively well-compacted nest mounds and associated sediments also contribute to the stability of delta distributary channels during regressive-transgressive cycles, and can lead to the minor channelization of unconfined flows where currents are diverted around nest mounds. Pleistocene exhumed surfaces of relatively well-indurated lake margin sediments at Lake Bogoria and Lake Magadi that are interpreted as combined regressive and transgressive surfaces (flooding surface/sequence boundary) preserve evidence of flamingo activities, and are overlain by younger, porous lacustrine silts that preserve large bubble pores produced by flamingos.

Paleoindian Settlement Decisions in the Great Basin: A Test of the Pluvial Lake Hypothesis with the Ideal Free Distribution Model	PALEOAMERICA												Researchers propose that early Great Basin occupants preferentially settled near pluvial lakes to exploit highly profitable wetland habitats. Here we offer a preliminary systematic evaluation of this Pluvial Lake Hypothesis by testing two predictions from an ideal free distribution (IFD) model using a comprehensive database of radiocarbon-dated archaeological sites relative to reconstructed lake extent. We find that Paleoindian (> 8000 calendar years ago) settlements are significantly closer to wetlands than random across the Great Basin. However, when broken out by subregion (western, central, and eastern), the trend only holds for the western basin, likely because wetlands are so abundant in the central and eastern subregions that even random settlements fall within a 10-km foraging radius. The eastern subregion is the most suitable, having the lowest average distance to wetland habitats, and is the earliest occupied, which supports IFD predictions. This general pattern may help explain Paleoindian settlement patterns more broadly.

J	LIVERMAN, DGE				LIVERMAN, DGE			SEDIMENTATION IN ICE-DAMMED HAZARD LAKE, YUKON	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												"Hazard Lake", located in Kluane National Park, the Yukon, is an ice-dammed lake formed in 1966 by the surge of the Steele Glacier. Since 1975 it has drained annually by means of a subglacial tunnel. During July 1979, observations were made of lake processes before drainage and of sections described in the lake bottom after drainage. Three facies associations are believed to represent prelake, stable lake, and annual draining phases. Gravel commonly found at the base of sections represents deposition in a braided fluvial system prior to 1966. Lake sediments deposited between 1966 and 1975 are dominantly graded laminated silt deposited by turbid underflow from the major inflow stream. Lamination is probably caused by diurnal underflow events or daily variation in strength of underflow. No "winter" clay component of varved sediments is observed. During drainage a regressive sequence is deposited as the lake level drops, with sand-dominated sediments overlapping laminated silt where the main inflow stream enters the lake. This is followed by local fluvial deposition along the course of the reestablished stream. During filling a transgressive sequence is deposited as the lake level rises. Sand-dominated deltaic sedimentation is followed by deposition from underflow, resulting in laminated and massive silt and clay. These fine-grained facies separate sand facies and demark individual filling events but are easily eroded. Thus it is not possible to identify the effects of each individual drainage-filling cycle in the sediments. After drainage the lake remains empty until the next melt season, during which time a braided stream is established in the lake basin, depositing sands and gravels and eroding lake sediments.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	1987	24	9					1797	1806		10.1139/e87-171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e87-171													WOS:A1987K593000006

Declines in Reproductive Condition of Male Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) Following Seasonal Exposure to Estrogenic Endocrine-Disrupting Compounds	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES												Reproductive abnormalities, that could lead to possible effects at the population level, have been observed in wild fish throughout the United States, with high prevalence in largemouth bass (LMB; Micropterus salmoides) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu). Estrone (E1) and atrazine (ATR) are common environmental contaminants often associated with agricultural land use. 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a contaminant associated with wastewater treatment effluent, and a representative, well-studied estrogen commonly used for fish toxicity testing. Our objective was to assess whether early gonad recrudescence in adult fish was a period of sensitivity for alterations in reproductive condition and function. Adult male LMB were exposed from post-spawning to early gonad recrudescence to either a mixture of E1 (47.9 ng/L) + ATR (5.4 mu g/L), or EE2 (2.4 ng/L) in outdoor experimental ponds. Gonad samples were collected from fish just prior to the start of exposure (July), at the end of the exposure period (December), the following spring just prior to spawning (April), and post spawning (May). Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly reduced in E1 + ATR-exposed and EE2-exposed males compared to control at every post-exposure time point. Reduced sperm count and sperm motility were observed in the mixture treatment (E1 + ATR) compared to the control. Sperm motility was also reduced in the EE2 treatment. These data together indicate that estrogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds can lessen the reproductive condition of adult male LMB, and that effects of exposure during early gonad recrudescence can persist at least through the subsequent spawning cycle.					; Tillitt, Donald/AAW-3851-2020	Leet, Jessica/0000-0001-8142-6043; Richter, Catherine/0000-0001-7322-4206; 													1661-6596	1422-0067				DEC	2022	23	24							16131	10.3390/ijms232416131	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms232416131								36555769					WOS:000902562700001

It showed marked seasonal fluctuations in population abundance, with maximum numbers occurring in summer. In the laboratory, mean daily egg production rates ( EPR) of P. umbraticus were positively correlated with temperature, with values ranging from ( mean +/- SD) 2.3 +/- 6.3 eggs female(-1) d(-1) at 14 degrees C to 6.1 +/- 10.2 eggs female(-1) d(-1) at 24 degrees C. In terms of total egg production over the entire female lifespan, maximum values occurred at 14 degrees C and minimum at 24 degrees C. At 12 and 32 degrees C, females were able to survive, but they stopped egg production. Temperature also dramatically affected female copepod lifespan, which was shorter at higher temperatures. Development time for the eggs de creased with increasing temperature, as did development time from egg to adulthood. Recruitment rate was low at lower temperatures. The distinctive egg- laying behaviour of P. umbraticus is described here for the first time. The EPR in P. umbraticus is relatively low compared to other pelagic copepods, but within the ranges reported for egg- carrying species. Greater fecundity at higher temperatures compared to other subtemperate species indicates that P. umbraticus is well adapted to the higher temperatures of coastal brackish basins, where it contributes to the bio diversity of the plankton community at night as it migrates from the substratum into the water column.

J	Bunbury, J; Gajewski, K				Bunbury, Joan; Gajewski, Konrad			Postglacial climates inferred from a lake at treeline, southwest Yukon Territory, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Pollen, chironomid, and ostracode records from a lake located at alpine treeline provide regional paleoclimate reconstructions from the southwest Yukon Territory, Canada. The pollen spectra indicate herbaceous tundra existed on the landscape from 13.6-11 ka followed by birch shrub tundra until 10 ka. Although Picea pollen dominated the assemblages after 10 ka, low pollen accumulation rates and Picea percentages indicate minimal treeline movement through the Holocene. Chironomid accumulation rates provide evidence of millennial-scale climate variability, and the chironomid community responded to rapid climate changes. Ostracodes were found in the late glacial and early Holocene, but disappeared due to chemical changes of the lake associated with changes in vegetation on the landscape. Inferred mean July air temperature, total annual precipitation, and water depth indicate a long-term cooling with increasing moisture from the late glacial through the Holocene. During the Younger Dryas (12.9-11.2 ka), cold and dry conditions prevailed. The early and mid-Holocene were warm and dry, with cool, wet conditions after 4 ka, and warm, dry conditions since the end of the Little Ice Age. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Khan, SA; Vanselow, KA; Sass, O; Samimi, C				Khan, Saeed A.; Vanselow, Kim A.; Sass, Oliver; Samimi, Cyrus			Detecting abrupt change in land cover in the eastern Hindu Kush region using Landsat time series (1988-2020)	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Land cover change in the semi-arid environment of the eastern Hindu Kush region is driven by anthropogenic activities and environmental change impacts. Natural hazards, such as floods presumably influenced by climatic change, cause abrupt change of land cover. So far, little research has been conducted to investigate the spatiotemporal aspects of this abrupt change in the valleys. In order to explore the abrupt change in land cover and floods as its possible drivers in the eastern Hindu Kush, a semi-arid mountain region characterized by complex terrain, vegetation variation, and precipitation seasonality, we analyzed long-term Landsat image time series from 1988 to 2020 using Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). Overall, BFAST effectively detected abrupt change by using Landsat-derived Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI). The results of our study indicate that approximately 95% of the study area experienced at least one abrupt change during 1988-2020. The years 1991, 1995, 1998, 2007, and 2016 were detected as the peak years, with the peaks occurring in different seasons. The annual trend of abrupt change is decreasing for the study area. The seasonality of abrupt change at the catchment level shows an increasing trend in the spring season for the southern catchments of Panjkora and Swat. The spatial distribution patterns show that abrupt change is primarily concentrated in the floodplains indicating that flooding is the primary driver of the land cover change in the region. We also demonstrated the accurate detection of past flood events (2015) based on the two case examples of Ayun, Rumbur, and Kalash valleys. The detection of the flood events was verified by fieldwork and historical high-resolution Google Earth imagery. Finally, our study provides an example of applying Landsat time series in a dry mountain region to detect abrupt changes in land cover and analyze impact of natural hazards such as floods.					; Khan, Saeed/ABO-3533-2022; Samimi, Cyrus/H-8085-2012	Khan, Saeed A./0000-0003-4993-7243; Vanselow, Kim Andre/0000-0003-3299-6220; Samimi, Cyrus/0000-0001-7001-7893													1672-6316	1993-0321				JUN	2022	19	6					1699	1716		10.1007/s11629-021-7297-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-021-7297-y		MAY 2022											WOS:000793688000003

A 45 kyr palaeoclimate record from the lowland interior of tropical South America	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We present a well-dated, high-resolution, similar to 45 kyr lake sediment record reflecting regional temperature and precipitation change in the continental interior of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropics of South America. The study site is Laguna La Gaiba (LLG), a large lake (95 km(2)) hydrologically-linked to the Pantanal, an immense, seasonally-flooded basin and the world's largest tropical wetland (135,000 km(2)). Lake-level changes at LLG are therefore reflective of regional precipitation. We infer past fluctuations in precipitation at this site through changes in: i) pollen-inferred extent of flood-tolerant forest; ii) relative abundance of terra firme humid tropical forest versus seasonally-dry tropical forest pollen types; and iii) proportions of deep-versus shallow-water diatoms. A probabilistic model, based on plant family and genus climatic optima, was used to generate quantitative estimates of past temperature from the fossil pollen data. Our temperature reconstruction demonstrates rising temperature (by 4 degrees C) at 19.5 kyr BP, synchronous with the onset of deglacial warming in the central Andes, strengthening the evidence that climatic warming in the SH tropics preceded deglacial warming in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) by at least 5 kyr. We provide unequivocal evidence that the climate at LLG was markedly drier during the last glacial period (45.0-12.2 kyr BP) than during the Holocene, contrasting with SH tropical Andean and Atlantic records that demonstrate a strengthening of the South American summer monsoon during the global Last Glacial Maximum (similar to 21 kyr BP), in tune with the similar to 20 kyr precession orbital cycle. Holocene climate conditions occurred as early as 12.8-12.2 kyr BP, when increased precipitation in the Pantanal catchment caused heightened flooding and rising lake levels in LLG. In contrast to this strong geographic variation in LGM precipitation across the continent. expansion of tropical dry forest between 10 and 3 kyr BP at LLG strengthens the body of evidence for widespread early-mid Holocene drought across tropical South America.

The results indicate that, the primary component of CDOM is humic-like. The secondary component is tryptophan-like, which is the product of phytoplankton and aquatic debris rather than the wastewater treatment drainaged from city. In this study, six fluorophores with multiple excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) peaks (A, B, C, N, M, T) were identified according to the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). The average contribution of each component to the CDOM is 19.93, 18.82, 16.88, 16.39, 12.26, and 15.72%, respectively. Red Shifted phenomenon will happen with the increase of fluorescence intensity for ultraviolet and terrestrially humic-like. Conversely, marine humic-like will appear Reverse Red Shifted with the increase of fluorescence intensity. The primary contributor to the shoulder value of CDOM's absorption coefficient at 275 nm is phytoplankton productivity, followed by marine humic-like. The main contributors to the shoulder shape are UV humic-like and phytoplankton productivity, followed by marine humic-like and tryptophan-like. A strong correlation between CDOM absorption and fluorescence intensity at emission wavelength of 424 nm and excitation wavelength ranging from 280 to 360 nm was found. The absorption coefficient can be retrieved successfully from the same excitation wavelength's fluorescence intensity by an exponential model.					huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; huang, changchun/E-6580-2016	huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663; huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X													1129-5767	1723-8633					2013	72	2					326	335		10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e26	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2013.e26													WOS:000324045100011

The attention was initially given to the fumaroles and the boiling pools of Solfatara and Pisciarelli, then subsequently extended to thermal springs, dug wells, and crater lakes. Analytical data pertaining to a period preceding the last crisis of 1982-1984 were then available, as well as other data collected during the previous crisis of 1970; a comprehensive picture of the variations observed before, during and after the acceleration of vertical movement has been drawn. According to the results obtained, the intrusion of a magmatic body as the trigger of the observed ground deformation is considered unrealistic. The whole area appears now in a quiet stage, and no further perturbation is expected without previous significant tectonic activity; chemical precursors appear suitable for an early detection of changes occurring at depth, to forecast possible consequences to be expected in the surface environment.

However, the spatial distribution and monthly variation in local water quality have been poorly understood until recently. In this study, the spatial-temporal variations of 12 water quality parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate index (I-Mn), chemical oxygen demand (COD), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia nitrogen (N-NH3), total nitrogen (N-total), total phosphorus (P-total), copper (Cu), fluoride (F), arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd), were determined from samples collected monthly at 22 water cross-sectional sites in the Ngari region in 2020. The surface water pollution in the southern Ngari region was the most serious, and the water pollution level in winter was higher than that in the other seasons. As (0.0781 similar to 0.6154 mg/L) and F (1.05 similar to 4.64 mg/L) were the main exceedance factors derived from the recharge of high arsenic and fluoride geothermal water and weathering of As and F-bearing minerals. The hazard quotient and carcinogenic risk for As and F at the five contaminated sampling sites indicated potential health risks and even carcinogenicity to local populations. The hydrochemistry types of the lakes and rivers in the Ngari region were mainly chloride water and carbonate water. The results from this study can provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of surface water pollution in the Ngari region and contribute to subsequent research on the ecology of water bodies.																			0269-4042	1573-2983				OCT	2024	46	10							393	10.1007/s10653-024-02176-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-024-02176-z								39180598					WOS:001297623900003
J	Bischoff, A; Vogel, N; Roszjar, J				Bischoff, Addi; Vogel, Nadia; Roszjar, Julia			The Rumuruti chondrite group	CHEMIE DER ERDE-GEOCHEMISTRY												Since 1994, the Rumuruti (R) chondrites have been recognized as a new, well-established chondrite group differing from carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondrites. The first R chondrite, Carlisle Lakes, was found in Australia in 1977. Meanwhile, the number has increased to 107 (December, 2010). This group is named after the Rumuruti meteorite, the first and so far the only R chondrite fall. Most of the R chondrites are breccias containing a variety of different clasts embedded in a clastic matrix. Some textural and mineralogical characteristics can be summarized as follows: (a) the chondrule abundance in large fragments and in unbrecciated rocks is similar to 35-50 vol%; (b) Ca,Al-rich inclusions are rare; (c) the olivine abundance is typically 65-78 vol%; (d) the mean chondrule diameter is similar to 400 mu m; (e) in unequilibrated R chondrites, low-Ca pyroxene is dominating, whereas in equilibrated R chondrites it is Ca-rich pyroxene; (f) the typical olivine in a metamorphosed lithology is similar to Fa(38-40) (g) matrix olivine in unequilibrated, type 3 fragments and rocks has much higher Fa (similar to 45-60 mol%) compared to matrix olivines in type 4-6 lithologies (similar to Fa(38-41)); (h) spinels have a high TiO2 of similar to 5 wt%; (i) abundant different noble metal-bearing phases (metals, sulfides, tellurides, arsenides) occur. The exception is the metamorphosed, type 5/6 R chondrite La Paz Icefield 04840 which contains hornblende, phlogopite, and Ca-poor pyroxene, the latter phase typically occurring in low-grade metamorphosed R chondrites only. In bulk composition, R chondrites have some affinity to ordinary chondrites: (a) the absence of significant depletions in Mn and Na in R chondrites and ordinary chondrites is an important feature to distinguish these groups from carbonaceous chondrites; (b) total Fe (similar to 24 wt%) of R chondrites is between those of H and L chondrites (27.1 and 21.6 wt%, respectively); (c) the average Cl/Mg-normalized lithophile element abundances are similar to 0.95 x CI, which is lower than those for carbonaceous chondrites (>= 1.0 x CI) and slightly higher than those for ordinary chondrites (similar to 0.9 x CI); (d) trace element concentrations such as Zn (similar to 150 ppm) and Se (similar to 15 ppm) are much higher than in ordinary chondrites; (e) the whole rock Delta O-17 of similar to 2.7 for R chondrites is the highest among all meteorite groups, and the mean oxygen isotope composition is delta O-17 = 5.36 +/- 0.43, delta O-18 = 5.07 +/- 0.86, Delta O-17 = +2.72 +/- 0.31; (f) noble gas cosmic ray exposure ages of R chondrites range between similar to 0.1 and similar to 70 Ma. More than half of the R chondrites analyzed for noble gases contain implanted solar wind and, thus, are regolith breccias. The 43 R chondrites from Northern Africa analyzed so far for noble gases seem to represent at least 16 falls. Although the data base is still scarce, the data hint at a major collision event on the R chondrite parent body between 15 and 25 Ma ago. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

At monthly intervals 5 bags were harvested at each level and dry weight changes noted. Results indicate little difference in decomposition between depths over the winter months. Beginning in May, significant differences were noted between 1 m and all other depths for the remainder of the experimental period. Maples lost 100% of weight at 1 m, 54% at 4 m and 55% at 12 m over the experimental period. The rate of decomposition over the total experiment period was approximately .03 g/da at 1 m and .015 g/da at the 4 and 12 m depths. These results are discussed in terms of regulation of decomposition, position of decomposition and contribution to lake metabolism.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1979	64	3					195	197		10.1007/BF00020519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00020519													WOS:A1979HF41500001

After 1965, when most of the swamp water inflow was diverted from the lake, certain populations have penetrated into deeper layers, while the average overlap in the community has dropped. The summer dominant Mesocyclops leuckarti disappeared and Chydorus sphaericus appeared in mass quantities; this development was not associated with biomass changes of blue-greens. The Cladocera/Calanoida ratio and the relative abundance of certain species showed no considerable changes. The effect of Chaoborus, Cyclops and Leptodora in the 70''s on the crustacean populations was insignificant in spite of the increasing abundance of these genera after 1965. Analysis of the dynamics of the clutch size and the density of lake populations in the 1970''s and 1980''s revealed food limitation and competition in herbivorous Cladocera. In laboratory experiments with lake water they always competed, though the intensity of their interaction varied depending on the species combinations.

Diverse and highly active diazotrophic assemblages inhabit ephemerally wetted soils of the Antarctic Dry Valleys	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Eolian transport of biomass from ephemerally wetted soils, associated with summer glacial meltwater runoffs and lake edges, to low-productivity areas of the Antarctic Dry Valleys (DV) has been postulated to be an important source of organic matter (fixed nitrogen and fixed carbon) to the entire DV ecosystem. However, descriptions and identification of the microbial members responsible for N2 fixation within these wetted sites are limited. In this study, N2 fixers from wetted soils were identified by direct nifH gene sequencing and their in situ N2 fixation activities documented via acetylene reduction and RNA-based quantitative PCR assays. Shannon-index nifH diversity levels ranged between 1.8 and 2.6 and included the expected cyanobacterial signatures and a large number of phylotypes related to the gamma-, beta-, alpha-, and delta-proteobacteria. N2 fixation rates ranged between approximately 0.5 and 6nmolNcm-3h-1 with measurements indicating that approximately 50% of this activity was linked with sulfate reduction at some sites. Comparisons with proximal dry soils also suggested that these communities are not ubiquitously distributed, and conditions unrelated to moisture content may define the composition, diversity, or habitat suitability of the microbial communities within wetted soils of the DVs.

J	Auer, B; Czioska, E; Arndt, H				Auer, B; Czioska, E; Arndt, H			The pelagic community of a gravel pit lake:: Significance of Coleps hirtus viridis (Prostomatida) and its role as a scavenger	LIMNOLOGICA												Coleps hirtus viridis was the dominant species of the planktonic ciliate community of Lake Fijhlinger See (Germany) during the study in 1999 and 2000. Total ciliate densities ranged from 120 to 42,000 ind. l(-1) in 1999 and up to 8,000 ind. l(-1) in 2000. Coleps contributed up to 98% to both total ciliate abundance and biomass and made up an average of 64% of the total ciliate biomass. Oligotrichs (Rimostrombidium, Strobilidium) dominated the epilimnetic zone, whereas peritrich ciliates (Pelagovorticella, Vorticella) were predominantly located in the hypolimnion. The population maximum of Coleps changed locations from the epilimnion in early summer to the hypolimnion (up to 40,000 ind. l(-1)) during stratification. High growth rates in the hypolimnion, presence of endosymbiontic algae and the ability to ingest detritus seem to be important for the success. Growth rates of Coleps in June were determined by Landry-Hassett dilution experiments in both the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. The instantaneous growth rates were similar in both layers (0.6 d(-1)), but a distinctly higher instantaneous mortality was estimated for the epilimnion. These high loss rates may be due to grazing pressure by cladocerans. The significance of the histophagous feeding of Coleps was evaluated through an experiment using killed zooplankton. Parts of Daphnia magna were incorporated at rates of about 1,100 mum(3) ind.(-1) h(-1) by Coleps without endosymbiotic algae and at rates of 500 mum(3) ind.(-1) h(-1) by Coleps with endosymbionts. These high feeding rates support the conclusion that Coleps can use dead organic matter as an additional food source.

Todd			Seasonal dynamics and exports of elements from a first-order stream to a large inland lake in Michigan	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Headwater streams are critical components of drainage systems, directly connecting terrestrial and downstream aquatic ecosystems. The amount of water in a stream can alter hydrologic connectivity between the stream and surrounding landscape and is ultimately an important driver of what constituents headwater streams transport. There is a shortage of studies that explore concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in headwater systems, especially forested watersheds, where the hydrological and ecological processes that control the processing and export of solutes can be directly investigated. We sought to identify the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of stream chemistry at three points along a forested headwater stream in Northern Michigan and utilize C-Q relationships to explore transport dynamics and potential sources of solutes in the stream. Along the stream, surface flow was seasonal in the main stem, and perennial flow was spatially discontinuous for all but the lowest reaches. Spring snowmelt was the dominant hydrological event in the year with peak flows an order of magnitude larger at the mouth and upper reaches than annual mean discharge. All three C-Q shapes (positive, negative, and flat) were observed at all locations along the stream, with a higher proportion of the analytes showing significant relationships at the mouth than at the mid or upper flumes. At the mouth, positive (flushing) C-Q shapes were observed for dissolved organic carbon and total suspended solids, whereas negative (dilution) C-Q shapes were observed for most cations (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+) and biologically cycled anions (NO3-, PO43-, SO42-). Most analytes displayed significant C-Q relationships at the mouth, indicating that discharge is a significant driving factor controlling stream chemistry. However, the importance of discharge appeared to decrease moving upstream to the headwaters where more localized or temporally dynamic factors may become more important controls on stream solute patterns.					; Nave, Lucas/GRX-9708-2022	Heckman, Katherine/0000-0003-2265-4542; Hofmeister, Kathryn/0000-0002-0200-3817; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				MAY 15	2019	33	10					1476	1491		10.1002/hyp.13416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13416													WOS:000465085300007

We used the most probable number technique combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to identify apparent numerically important populations of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in a hypersaline microbial-mat. At high dilutions, populations related to the genera Rhodobacter and Roseobacter and to the genera Marinobacter and Halomonas dominated glycolate and yeast extract-amended enrichment cultures respectively. Three selected isolates of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria were obtained from glycolate-amended enrichments and found to relate phylogenetically to species of the genus Roseobacter. These strains were found to grow, in addition to glycolate, on several other photosynthetic compounds known to be produced by cyanobacteria suggesting that they specialize in mineralizing photosynthetic excretion products. Our study demonstrates that aerobic heterotrophs, which are phylogenetically affiliated to genera such as Rhodobacter, Roseobacter, Marinobacter and Halomonas, are important in hypersaline microbial mats, and that their specific in situ role in the carbon cycle needs to be further investigated.

J	Wolin, JA				Wolin, JA			Late Holocene lake-level and lake development signals in Lower Herring Lake, Michigan	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Paleolimnological investigations of a marginal lake in the Lake Michigan basin revealed signals of long-term lake-level changes primarily controlled by climatic forces. Multiple analyses identified concurrent signals in sediment chemistry, grain size, and the microfossil record. Coarse-grained sediments, benthic diatoms, and nutrient response species increased as lake levels rose or fell. Finer sediments and higher percentages of taxa associated with stable thermocline conditions occurred during high-lake periods. Sedimentary evidence revealed corresponding strong high-lake signals c. 2500-2200, 1800-1500, 1170-730, and 500-280 BP. Low-lake periods occurred c. 1500-1170 and 700-500 B.P. An additional signal of lake-level decline was apparent beginning c. 280 BP but was interrupted by anthropogenic effects. Evidence of extreme low-lake levels (c. 1400-1300 BP), and signals for a medieval warming period (1030-910 BP) and the Maunder minimum (370-325 BP) indicate occurrence of short-lived dry climatic conditions.																			0921-2728					JAN	1996	15	1					19	45																WOS:A1996TU74700002
J	Brown, SR; Fritz, SC; Morgan, LA; Shanks, WC				Brown, Sabrina R.; Fritz, Sherilyn C.; Morgan, Lisa A.; Shanks, Wayne C., III			Fossilized diatoms of siliceous hydrothermal deposits in Yellowstone National Park, USA	DIATOM RESEARCH												The study of eukaryotic extremophiles is relatively novel, and, therefore, documentation of the structure and function of micro-organisms in continental hydrothermal systems globally is limited. In this study, we investigate fossil diatoms in siliceous hydrothermal deposits of the Upper Geyser and Yellowstone Lake hydrothermal basins in Yellowstone National Park, and utilize preserved diatom assemblages to infer local environmental conditions. Siliceous sinter from both the Upper Geyser Basin and Yellowstone Lake contains evidence of in-situ diatom growth within these environments. At Upper Geyser Basin, the assemblage consisted of species that could grow on moist siliceous sinter and was dominated by Rhopalodia gibberula. Diatom valves were found in various preservation states, ranging from nearly pristine to highly diagenetically altered. Diatoms collected from siliceous spires in Yellowstone Lake consisted largely of tychoplanktonic and benthic species that were almost certainly growing on the outside of the structure, with an assemblage indicative of relatively shallow, alkaline waters. What remains unclear without access to material for high-resolution dating is whether diatoms colonized the spires during hydrothermal activity or after activity ceased. Our results indicate that diatom frustules can, to some extent, survive alteration in low-temperature (<76 degrees C) hydrothermal environments.																			0269-249X	2159-8347				OCT 2	2019	34	4					193	204		10.1080/0269249X.2019.1698466	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.2019.1698466		DEC 2019											WOS:000503295400001

Mercury concentrations in fish from three major lakes in north Mississippi: Spatial and temporal differences and human health risk assessment	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES												The goal of this study was to compare total mercury (Hg) concentrations in fish muscle tissue and assess consumption health risks of fish collected from three north Mississippi lakes (Sardis, Enid, and Grenada) that are extensively used for fishing and recreation. Largemouth bass (LMB; n = 64), channel catfish (CC; n = 72), and white crappie (WC; n = 100), which represent a range of trophic levels, were collected during spring 2013 and 2014. Creel data estimated that anglers harvested approximately 370,000 kg of WC, 27,000 kg of CC, and 15,000 kg of LMB from the lakes annually. Median Hg wet weight concentrations were highest in LMB (443 ng/g), followed by CC (211 ng/g) and WC (192 ng/g). Fish-Hg concentrations were lower than those reported in fish >10 years ago. There were significant differences between lakes consistent across species. Grenada length-normalized fish-Hg concentrations were higher than those from Enid and Sardis. Because existing consumption advisories for CC are length based, the lack of relationship between length and Hg concentration indicated that the recommendations may not be sufficiently protective. Further, five different risk assessment paradigms yielded hazard quotient (HQ) values suggesting that existing fish consumption advisories may be insufficient to protect adults and especially children from exposure to Hg.

J	Chow, N; Wendte, J				Chow, Nancy; Wendte, Jack			Palaeosols and palaeokarst beneath subaerial unconformities in an Upper Devonian isolated reef complex (Judy Creek), Swan Hills Formation, west-central Alberta, Canada	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Subaerial unconformities are used widely for palaeoenvironmental and palaeogeographic reconstructions, sequence stratigraphy and petroleum reservoir assessments. Recognition and interpretation of these unconformities, particularly those with associated palaeosols, may be problematic in Lower and Middle Palaeozoic carbonate successions because of the collective effect of limited land plant development, superficial similarities between some pedogenic and marine features, and overprinting by later diagenesis. The isolated Judy Creek reef complex in the Lower Frasnian Swan Hills Formation in west-central Alberta, Canada, contains two subaerial unconformities, R0.5 and R4, which formed as a consequence of relative sea-level falls of at least regional scale. Deposits beneath these unconformities have distinctive palaeosol and palaeokarst features. The lower unconformity, R0.5, occurs at the top of a progradational reefal phase of stromatoporoid rudstones-floatstones and peloidal packstones-grainstones and has been recognized in at least one other isolated Swan Hills reef complex (Snipe Lake). Palaeosol-palaeokarst profiles beneath this unconformity extend as deep as ca 2 m below the unconformity. These profiles are characterized by the presence of small rhizoliths, laminar calcretes, ferroan dolomite glaebules, desiccation cracks, breccias, green shale and solution vugs. The upper unconformity, R4, occurs at the top of a backstepping phase of reef growth and has been correlated widely between isolated reefs and carbonate banks on both the western and eastern shelves of the Central Alberta Basin. Palaeosol-palaeokarst profiles, extending as deep as ca 9 center dot 5 m beneath the R4 unconformity, are distinguished by abundant, sub-horizontal desiccation cracks filled with green shale, occurring in peloidal wackestones-packstones. Comparison of the R0.5 and R4 profiles indicates that the major intrinsic controls on the development and modification of the profiles are parent-material lithology, particularly the prior degree of induration and particle size; the low topographic relief at the top of the reef interior; and limited vegetation of the exposed reef top due to unfavourable growth conditions and geographic isolation. In addition to climate, the major extrinsic controls are the extent of relative sea-level fall, estimated to be 2 center dot 5 to 3 m and 13 to 14 m associated with the R0.5 and R4 unconformities, respectively, and the degree of shoreface erosion during the ensuing marine transgression, estimated to be up to 3 m. This study highlights the complex interplay of mainly physical and chemical processes influencing the formation of subaerial unconformities in carbonate environments during the Devonian, before major evolutionary innovations among vascular land plants led to more intense pedogenesis.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				JUN	2011	58	4					960	993		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2010.01191.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2010.01191.x													WOS:000290625900007

Environmental flow (EF) release from upstream reservoirs could help conserve and restore these lakes. However, experiences from regions lacking environmental legislation or with insufficient water resources management show that, despite EF allocation, farmers tend to use all available water for agriculture. In this study, we employed a new method for designing environmental flow release strategies to restore desiccated terminal lakes in arid and semi-arid regions with intensive cultivation within the catchment. The novelty of the method is that it takes into account farmers' water use behavior and the natural flow regime in upstream systems to design an optimum monthly EF release strategy for reservoirs. We applied the method to the water resource system of Lake Urmia, once the largest saline lake in the Middle East and now one of the most endangered saline lakes in the world. The analysis showed that the EF released is exploited by lowland farmers before reaching Lake Urmia and that inflow to the lake from some rivers has decreased by up to 80%. We propose a new EF release strategy that requires a considerable change in practice whereby water is released in the shortest possible time (according to reservoir outlet capacity) during the period of lowest irrigation demand in winter. Restoring the lake to minimum ecological level would require 2.4-3.4 km(3) EF allocation by different methods of release based on the recent condition (2002-2011) of the lake.					; Haghighi, Ali/AAE-6862-2021; Hekmatzadeh, Ali/R-6786-2019	Hekmatzadeh, Ali Akbar/0000-0002-4387-7166; Klove, Bjorn/0000-0002-2353-1440													0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2018	32	11					3595	3609		10.1007/s11269-018-2008-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-2008-3													WOS:000440115100004
J	BATZER, HO				BATZER, HO			HIBERNATION SITE AND DISPERSAL OF SPRUCE BUDWORM LARVAE AS RELATED TO DAMAGE OF SAPLING BALSAM FIR	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens), in the Lake States is primarily a pest of mature spruce-fir stands. Yet during the most recent outbreak, heavy infestations occurred on large areas of sapling stands in northeastern Minnesota. Budworms invaded these areas from infested mature stands by dispersal during the adult or early larval stages. Larvae were able to persist initially in the young stands by hibernating on scattered overstory cull spruce trees left from previous logging. From these trees larvae dispersed to the saplings, the dispersal distance depending on several factors including windspeed and length of thread spun by a larva. Laboratory studies showed that the buoyant effect of the silk increased exponentially with length of the thread. Once on the balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., saplings, the larvae produced hollowed-out vegetative buds during early spring feeding. These buds subsequently served as suitable hibernation sites where none existed before. Removal of the residual host trees is recommended as a preventive control technique.																			0022-0493	1938-291X					1968	61	1					216	+		10.1093/jee/61.1.216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/61.1.216													WOS:A1968A668100065

Phytoplankton in Antarctic lakes: biodiversity and main ecological features	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Antarctica holds a great number of inland lakes whose characteristics vary from ultra-oligotrophic to hypereutrophic, and from freshwater to hypersaline. The harsh conditions in these ecosystems (extremely low temperatures, large annual variation in solar radiation, light limitation below the ice) account for adaptive strategies of the selected phytoplankton species; some of them are mixotrophy, formation of resistant cysts, starch accumulation, pigment adaptation and motility. Algal richness is comparatively lower than in other parts of the world, although molecular studies are now revealing a biodiversity much higher than that previously based on morphological identifications. Many lakes are permanently stratified, such as perennially ice-covered or saline meromictic, whereas shallow lakes in coastal regions are usually ice-free in summer, accounting for contrasting patterns in their phytoplankton temporal dynamics. Simple and short food webs are characteristic of Antarctic lakes, where phytoplankton fraction > 2 mu m is usually dominated by nanoflagellates. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about phytoplankton of Antarctic lakes, including information on biodiversity (morphological-based, functional and molecular), and the main ecological aspects (colonization, endemism, ecological strategies, temporal dynamics, biotic interactions). We compared ecosystems of different trophic status and from Continental and Maritime Antarctica, including own data from manipulative experiments.

Based on shoreline features such as barrier bars, wave-cut benches, and beach gravel deposits, the playas of Mud Lake, Gold Flat, and Kawich Lake contained pluvial lakes. Based on fossils, palustral clay sediments, paleospring, and seep deposits, the playas of Stonewall Flat, Indian Springs Valley, and Three Lakes Valley contained extensive wetlands. Two playas in Cactus Flat and one at Dog Bone Lake contain none of these surface deposits and are interpreted to have hosted seasonal lakes and grassy meadows, based on modern analogs in the Pahrana-gat Valley. Radiocarbon dates from Mud Lake, Gold Flat, and Stonewall Flat indicate these environments existed up to the beginning of the Holocene ca. 10,000 years before present (yr B.P.) and would have provided resources of fresh water, fish and game, edible and medicinal plants, fuel, and materials for the construction of shelter. As changing climate conditions from 10,000-8000 radiocarbon yr B.P. forced the contraction and eventual disappearance of these lakes and wetlands, basins with larger surface water budgets probably furnished early inhabitants with useful resources after the pluvial features in the smaller basins had disappeared.																			0080-2018		978-0-8137-4122-2				2014	22						159	176		10.1130/2014.4122(15)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2014.4122(15)	10.1130/9780813741222												WOS:000343323900016
J	Nagumo, N; Sugai, T; Kubo, S				Nagumo, Naoko; Sugai, Toshihiko; Kubo, Sumiko			Late Quaternary floodplain development along the Stung Sen River in the Lower Mekong Basin, Cambodia	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Stung Sen River, the biggest tributary to Lake Tonle Sap in the Lower Mekong Basin in Cambodia, is characterized by large seasonal changes of water discharge under the Asian monsoon climate and seasonal changes in water level that reach at least 7 m and are controlled by the water level of the lake. The Stung Sen River floodplain consists of two geomorphic units: meander belt along the river channel and backmarsh. Coupled observations of outcrops along the river channel and arrays of sediment cores across the floodplain north of Kampong Chheuteal village and Kampong Thom City, c. 150 km and c. 70 km, respectively, reveal that floodplain environmental changes at c. 11 ka were possibly associated with the Holocene onset of the southeast Asian monsoon and probably with the emergence of Lake Tonle Sap. These observations also show that the present backmarsh-meander belt system was established about 5.5 ka along with the unique Mekong-Tonle Sap connection, characterized by a reversal in flow direction during the monsoon season. The meander belt materials are replaced as the river channel shifts on a decadal to centennial timescale. Backmarsh sediments at sites Kampong Chheuteal and Kampong Thom had a constant accumulation rate of about 0.5 mm/y during the Holocene, contrasting with rates of 0.1 mm/y during the late Pleistocene. At around 11 ka, a sand layer was deposited over all of the valley around Kampong Chheuteal, while wetlands enlarged around Kampong Thom, probably because of increased rainfall triggered by an enhancement of the Asian summer monsoon. This 11 ka horizon has since been covered by clayey sediments keeping pace with the accumulation of lacustrine sediments in Lake Tonle Sap. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal migration patterns of lower Mackenzie River coregonids	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2008	Advances in Limnology				10th Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	AUG, 2008	Winnipeg, CANADA					The five species of coregonids that inhabit the lower Mackenzie River, broad whitefish, Coregonus nasus, inconnu, Stenodus leucuicthys, lake whitefish, C. clupeaformis, Arctic cisco, C. autumnalis, and least cisco, C. sardinella, have unique life cycles wherein they undertake extensive migrations to and from spawning grounds, overwintering areas and feeding areas. We present analysis of these migratory patterns based on a study in the Arctic Red River situated in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The time of upstream and downstream migration as part of the spawning cycle was observed to be species-specific. We correlate the timing of migration to the seasonal development of gonads to determine the relative timing of spawning. Common garden experiments comparing the two most seasonally distinct species, broad whitefish and inconnu, showed that there was a difference between these species in the number of degree-days to hatch to compensate for the timing of spawning. Emergence of all species is under a strong stabilizing selection corresponding to the spring ice break-up on the Lower Mackenzie River. Due to this environmental constraint shared among all coregonid species in the system, we suggest that spawning timing is under disruptive selection to reduce hybridization among species. The common garden experiments above support a genetic alteration of the rate of embryonic development to allow for separation in timing of spawning among coregonids and therefore reinforce reproductive isolation among species.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47065-5				2012	63						133	146																WOS:000313086600010

First and 2nd instar larvae were observed from late April to late October, indicating a reproductive period of about half a year. C. flavicans overwintered in the 4th instar larvae. In water column samples, total density of all instars was 680-23 680 m(-2), and pupal density 0-2 600 m(-2); larvae of the Ist, 2nd, and 3rd instars showed 5-6 density peaks in 1987, suggesting that 5-6 generations occur during a year (peaks of the 4th instar larvae were not clear, probably due to their longer development than those of younger instars). In sediment samples, no Ist and 2nd instar larvae were found, 3rd instar larvae were found occasionally but density of the 4th instar larvae was 280-18 600 m(-2), and pupal density varied between 0-502 m(-2). Fouth instar larvae accumulated in sediment in the cold season and in the water column in the warm season; high temperature and low oxygen concentration were the most important factors limiting the distribution of larvae in the sediment in summer in the NIES pond. The dry weight of total C. flavicans larvae was 0.08-4.2 g m(-2) in sediment samples and 24-599 mu g l(-1) (0.10-2.40 g m(-2)) in water column samples. Comparisons of maximum densities in the NIES pond in different years and in waters of different trophic status show that density is generally higher in eutrophic than in oligotrophic habitats.

J	Strömbeck, N; Pierson, DC				Strömbeck, N; Pierson, DC			The effects of variability in the inherent optical properties on estimations of chlorophyll a by remote sensing in Swedish freshwaters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												During late summer of 1997 measurements were made of the inherent optical properties in Lake Malaren, Sweden. These included measurements of the total particulate absorption, phytoplankton absorption, yellow substance absorption and total backscattering. Measurements were also made of concentrations known to affect the inherent optical properties; chlorophyll a and suspended particulate organic and inorganic matter. At the same time measurements of underwater radiance reflectance were made. The above measurements were used to better define the relationships between the inherent optical properties and the concentrations affecting them. Correlation analyses were also made in order to study covariation of the concentrations of suspended and dissolved substances in the data set. These relationships were then used to better parameterize a semi-analytical model predicting remote sensing reflectance. Multivariate sensitivity analyses showed that large variations on the Rr(700-710)/Rr(678-685) ratio vs. chlorophyll concentrations could be expected in a heterogeneous environment such as Lake Malaren. This could lead to large errors in subsequent estimates of chlorophyll concentrations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Rapid Eutrophication of a Clearwater Lake: Trends and Potential Causes Inferred From Phosphorus Mass Balance Analyses	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Many clearwater lakes increasingly show symptoms of eutrophication, but the underlying causes are largely unknown. We combined long-term water chemistry data, multi-year sediment trap measurements, sediment analyses and simple mass balance models to elucidate potential causes of eutrophication of a deep temperate clearwater lake, where total phosphorus (TP) concentrations quadrupled within a decade, accompanied by expanding hypolimnetic anoxia. Discrepancies between modeled and empirically determined P inputs suggest that the observed sharp rise in TP was driven by internal processes. The magnitude of seasonal variation in TP greatly increased at the same time, both in surface and deep water, partly decoupled from deep water oxygen conditions. A positive correlation between annual P loss from the upper water column and hypolimnetic P accumulation could hint at a short-circuited P cycle involving lateral TP transport from shallow-water zones and deposition and release from sediments in deep water. This hypothesis is also supported by P budgets for the upper 20 m during stable summer stratification, suggesting that sediments in shallow lake areas acted as a P net source until 2018. These changes are potentially related to shifts in submerged macrophytes from wintergreen charophyte meadows (Nitellopsis obtusa) to annual free-floating hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum) and to increased sulfide formation, promoting iron fixation in the sediments. Iron bound to sulfur is unavailable for binding P, resulting in a positive feedback between P release in shallow lake areas, primary productivity, macrophyte community structure and redox-dependent sediment biogeochemistry. Overall, our results suggest that relationships more complex than the commonly invoked increase in internal P release under increasingly anoxic conditions can drive rapid lake eutrophication. Since the proportion of littoral areas is typically large even in deep stratified lakes, littoral processes may contribute more frequently to the rapid lake eutrophication trends observed around the world than is currently recognized.					; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023	Hilt, Sabine/0000-0002-0585-2822; Gonsiorczyk, Thomas/0009-0004-4726-9709; Gessner, Mark O./0000-0003-2516-7416; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				NOV	2024	30	11							e17575	10.1111/gcb.17575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17575								39543974					WOS:001368921400001

Two lakes located south of the Yarlung Tsangpo River discharged at high lake levels. One of them, Drolung Co (Co is a local term, meaning lake), became closed (its water level fell below its outlet channel) at similar to 3.8 ka and lowered over 120 m vertically since then. This implies a significant change in intensity of precipitation driven by the Indian monsoon over southern Tibet in the middle-late Holocene. Nam Co and Dajia Co, located to the north of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, also drained at high lake levels and became closed similar to 53-36 ka and similar to 48 ka, respectively. Of four other lakes developed closely in the Qiangtang basin, north of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, Tangra Yum Co and Siling Co (located at 31-32 degrees N) show exposure ages for high lake shorelines of over 220 ka, the oldest lake shorelines reported for Tibet, while towards the north and west, the high lake of Zhari Nam Co appeared after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The different pattern of lake development to the north of Yarlung Tsangpo River may reflect regional climate effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Insua-Costa, D; Miguez-Macho, G				Insua-Costa, Damian; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo			A new moisture tagging capability in the Weather Research and Forecasting model: formulation, validation and application to the 2014 Great Lake-effect snowstorm	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS												A new moisture tagging tool, usually known as water vapor tracer (WVT) method or online Eulerian method, has been implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional meteorological model, enabling it for precise studies on atmospheric moisture sources and pathways. We present here the method and its formulation, along with details of the implementation into WRF. We perform an in-depth validation with a 1-month long simulation over North America at 20 km resolution, tagging all possible moisture sources: lateral boundaries, continental, maritime or lake surfaces and initial atmospheric conditions. We estimate errors as the moisture or precipitation amounts that cannot be traced back to any source. Validation results indicate that the method exhibits high precision, with errors considerably lower than 1% during the entire simulation period, for both precipitation and total precipitable water. We apply the method to the Great Lake-effect snowstorm of November 2014, aiming at quantifying the contribution of lake evaporation to the large snow accumulations observed in the event. We perform simulations in a nested domain at 5 km resolution with the tagging technique, demonstrating that about 30-50% of precipitation in the regions immediately downwind, originated from evaporated moisture in the Great Lakes. This contribution increases to between 50 and 60% of the snow water equivalent in the most severely affected areas, which suggests that evaporative fluxes from the lakes have a fundamental role in producing the most extreme accumulations in these episodes, resulting in the highest socioeconomic impacts.					; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/K-7008-2017	Insua-Costa, Damian/0000-0001-9699-2806; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; 													2190-4979	2190-4987				FEB 26	2018	9	1					167	185		10.5194/esd-9-167-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-167-2018													WOS:000426087000001

By external or internal inputs, there will be an increase in nutrient concentrations in those systems worldwide. Those nutrients will bring faster trophic changes to inland waters and possible health and recreational advisories. A novel approach using a floating filtration system, a silt curtain, and geotextiles (woven and non-woven) is under investigation. This method has been applied as an in-situ pilot experiment deployed at Lake Caron, a shallow eutrophic lake in Quebec, for two summers. Turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), blue-green-algae-phycocyanin (BGA-PC) and chlorophyll-a showed statistically significant average removal efficiencies of 53%, 22%, 49%, 57% and 56%, respectively, in the first year and 17%, 36%, 18%, 34% and 32% in the second. Statistical correlations were found with TSS, turbidity and variables that could represent particles (TP, turbidity, chlorophyll-a). Employing this in situ management method could be a promising remediation for not only shallow lakes (average depth < 2 m) but also for ponds, rivers, coastal regions, bays and other water types, to enable cleaner water for future generations.

Signals of Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age from southwestern Madhya Pradesh (India): A pollen-inferred Late-Holocene vegetation and climate change	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Pollen analysis of a 2 m deep sediment core from Khedla Quila Lake, Betul District (southwestern Madhya Pradesh), India has demonstrated the vegetation succession and climate change since the Late-Holocene. The pollen sequences have revealed that between 1416 and 506 cal BP (AD 534-1444), open mixed tropical deciduous forest comprising Madhuca indica, Sapotaceae, Holoptelea, Acacia, and Schleichera occupied the region under a warm and moderately humid climate, corresponding, to a certain extent, with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) that is known between AD 740 and 1150 worldwide. Between 506 and 120 cal BP (AD 1444-1830), the open mixed tropical deciduous forest was succeeded by dense mixed tropical deciduous forest due to the prevalence of a warm and humid climate, coinciding with the Little Ice Age (LIA) which falls within the temporal range of AD 1450 and 1850 at global level. Since 120 cal BP to Present (AD 1830 onwards), the open mixed tropical deciduous forest again came into existence owing to a warm and less humid climate. The cereal-based agriculture practice continued at almost the same pace, but the lake widened during the second phase, which could be attributed to increased monsoon precipitation.

Evidence for temporally coherent increases in the abundance of small Discostella (Bacillariophyceae) species over the past 200 years among boreal lakes from the Experimental Lakes Area (Canada)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Increased relative abundances and accumulation rates of the small, centric diatom Discostella have been recorded in numerous paleolimnological investigations of north temperate lakes that span the last century. Yet, conflicting observations in the seasonal succession of small Discostella from monitoring studies, and opposite patterns in their abundance in sediment cores from some nearby lakes have prevented consensus on the mechanisms responsible for this trend. Differences in lake and catchment characteristics that filter biological responses to regional environmental changes have likely played a role in this variability. We present detailed sub-fossil diatom data in dated sediment cores from eight small lakes in the undisturbed Experimental Lakes Area of northwest Ontario, Canada. These lakes were chosen because they experienced large (> 25%) increases in relative abundance of small Discostella taxa since pre-industrial times, enabling a clearer assessment of their change over time and linkages with climate. Our data showed increased abundances of small Discostella in all lakes, with changes in the majority of lakes beginning in the mid-1800s. Application of a hierarchical generalized additive model structure provided statistical evidence that this pattern was shared among all lakes, although lake-specific departures from this trend were also apparent. Based on the coincidence of trends with historical temperature records and results from previous phytoplankton monitoring studies in the ELA, we suggest that the observed recent increases in the proportion of Discostella may be related to earlier ice-off and extended periods of spring mixing, and that the small amount of between-lake variability is attributable to differences in lake morphometry.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2022	67	3					273	287		10.1007/s10933-021-00232-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-021-00232-7		JAN 2022											WOS:000746755200001

Magnitude and Origin of CO2 Evasion From High-Latitude Lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes evade significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere; yet the magnitude and origin of the evasion are still poorly constrained. We quantified annual CO2 evasion and its origin (in-lake net ecosystem production vs. lateral inputs from terrestrial ecosystems) in 14 high-latitude lakes through high-frequency estimates of open water CO2 flux and ecosystem metabolism and inorganic carbon mass-balance before and after ice breakup. Annual CO2 evasion ranged from 1 to 25 g C m(-2) yr(-1) of which an average of 57% was evaded over a short period at ice-breakup. Annual internal CO2 production ranged from -6 to 21 g C m(-2) yr(-1), of which at least half was produced over winter. The contribution of internal versus external source contribution to annual CO2 evasion varied between lakes, ranging from fully internal to fully external with most lakes having over 75% of the evasion sustained through a single source. Overall, the study stresses the large variability in magnitude and control of CO2 evasion and suggests that environmental change impacts on CO2 evasion from high-latitude lakes are not uniform.					; Klaus, Marcus/AAL-1818-2021	Klaus, Marcus/0000-0003-0747-3524; Karlsson, Jan/0000-0001-5730-0694; Verheijen, Hendricus/0000-0002-2858-6299; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN	2022	127	6							e2021JG006768	10.1029/2021JG006768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006768													WOS:000817010700001

This diatom, Eoseira wilsonii gen. et sp. nov., grew in filaments that constitute dense monospecific sub-horizons within the white couplets that represent summer deposition in the varved sequence. Although Eoseira clearly belongs within the Family Aulacoseiraceae, several features distinguish its valve structure from Aulacoseira. Gigantism of spines and the lack of geometric relationships between spine position and mantle areolae are the most conspicuous features of the genus. Eoseira is among the oldest freshwater diatoms known and one of relatively few extinct freshwater genera. In addition to serving as a potential biostratigraphic marker, Eoseira is a cornerstone to undertanding the evolutionary trajectory of the Aulacoseiraceae, likely the oldest family of freshwater diatoms. As such, it refines our understanding of early radiations from the marine realm in western North America. Furthermore, paleoecological inferences based on Eoseira life strategy pertain directly to limnological conditions during early Cenozoic hot-house conditions.

Drawdown restored the old stream channel within the lakebed to free-flowing conditions, which resulted in a temporary reestablishment of Boomer Creek through the lakebed site. Collections of invertebrates were made at eight locations in each of three stream reaches: upstream and downstream of the former impoundment, and in the stream channel within the former lakebed. Forty-three taxa were found in the stream, 33 of which occurred in the lakebed channel. Macroinvertebrate composition differed significantly among the three stream reaches, but macroinvertebrate densities did not. Dominant taxa in all areas were oligochaetes, chironomids. and a corixid predator of these groups, Trichocorixa sp, Other common taxa found included Hyalella azteca, Procambarus sp., Physella sp., and Sphaerium sp. Thirteen taxa found in the lakebed channel were also found in an earlier (pre-draining) study of Boomer Lake macroinvertebrates.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				SEP	1995	10	3					217	223		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663441													WOS:A1995RZ11300003

Both islands were colonized by beavers during the late 1940s or early 1950s in the absence of bears, and bears immigrated to Stockton Island in the 1970s. Active beaver colonies on Outer Island increased during the study whereas they declined on Stockton Island. Bears ate five beavers in live-traps and disturbed twelve other sets. Six of 90 bear bear scats found had beaver hair in them, and 18 of 26 beaver lodges were dug into by bears. Compared to Outer Island, beavers on Stockton Island cut fewer food trees relative to their availability, and cut few trees > 30 m from water, whereas beavers on Outer Island traveled > 200 m inland to forage. Mainland studies have not reported such intense beaver/bear interactions, nor is the behavioral or population response of beavers as significant where they are preyed upon by wolves (Canis lupus), a more typical beaver predator.																			0003-0031					OCT	1994	132	2					248	255		10.2307/2426580	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426580													WOS:A1994PN87400006

We studied the sediment diversity in two such lake-wetland systems and their surrounding catchments. The lakes were located in relatively close proximity to one another within the West Polesie Transboundary Biosphere Reserve, West Polesie, East Poland. In spite of physiographic similarities, the studied lake-wetland systems and their catchments displayed considerable diversity in their underlying sediments. This was determined from data collected from several hundred geological boreholes and 164 determinations of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the organic and mineral sediments (constant and falling head methods). Our research results showed that the functioning of a closed lake-wetland ecosystem is greatly influenced by the hydrogeological properties of its sediments. In the case of wetland zones surrounding lakes, especially closed-drainage seepage lakes, it is very important to identify the geological settings and the hydrogeological properties of those sediments in order to better understand groundwater influences.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2018	38	4					779	792		10.1007/s13157-018-1027-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-018-1027-4													WOS:000443995000011

Analysis of the dynamics and precipitation regime in the cross-border region Poland-Belarus- Ukraine (2010-2018)	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY												The work analyzes the dynamics and regime of atmospheric precipitation in the cross-border region of Poland-Belarus-Ukraine during the period 2010-2018. This time period was chosen, in particular, due to the need to find the prerequisites for the strong shallowing of lake complexes and the depletion of groundwater in the Polish region in 2019, which caused significant social and scientific resonance. The source data for the statistical part of the work were archival information from 17 weather stations in the specified region for this period. The main results of the study: 1) the dynamics of the average monthly precipitation amounts for each meteorological station were calculated and analyzed (Lutsk, Svityaz, Manevychi, Kovel, Liubeshiv, Volodymyr, Rivne, Dubno, Sarny, Brody, Rava-Ruska, Kamianka-Buzka, Pinsk, Pruzhany, Terespol, Wlodawa, Zamosc), the average amounts of precipitation that fell during the warm season of the year (IV-X months) and the cold season of the year (XI-III months), average annual precipitation amounts and precipitation amounts for the entire period, which was investigated (2010-2018). All calculated indicators were compared with the data of the climatic norm of 1961-1990). The annual number of days with precipitation, the warm and cold periods of the year, and the average values of this indicator were also determined. Based on the results of the statistical analysis, charts, cartograms, and several diagrams were developed that visually represent the peculiarities of the dynamics of atmospheric precipitation in the studied region during the analyzed period (2010-2018). 2) on the basis of the calculated indicators, maps of the geographical distribution of precipitation amounts on the territory of the cross-border region Poland-Belarus-Ukraine during the studied period (annual amounts, cold and warm season amounts) were constructed. When comparing them with maps of the period of the 20th century. Changes in the geography of distribution and trends of modern growth of precipitation amounts in the study region were revealed. After the analysis, a number of conclusions and generalizations were made: 1. During the period 2010-2018 in the territory of the cross-border region Poland-BelarusUkraine, the average annual amounts of precipitation increased by 20-45 mm compared to the climatic standard, while the average annual number of days with precipitation decreased by 25-30%. 2. Annual amounts of precipitation exceeded 600 mm at almost all (16 out of 17) meteorological stations whose data were analyzed. 3. The distribution of days with atmospheric precipitation during the seasons of the year has changed. The ratio between the amounts of precipitation that fell in the warm and cold periods of the year changed from 75/25 to 60/40 on average. In general, in the studied region, there are trends towards a slight increase in annual precipitation amounts, a redistribution of precipitation amounts in liquid and solid state in favor of rains, and a reduction in the total number of days with precipitation during the year and a more even distribution of them during the warm and cold seasons, compared to the climatic norm.

From 16S rDNA sequence analysis, nine isolates shared 100% identity with Bacillus halodurans strain DSM 497(T), while the rest shared 99% identity with alkaliphilic Bacillus species A-59. PCR of the intergenic spacer region between 16S and 23S rRNA genes (ISR-PCR) divided the isolates into two groups, while tDNA-PCR divided them into three groups. Bacillus halodurans DSM 497T had a different ISR pattern from the isolates, while it had a tDNA-PCR profile similar to the group that shared 99% identity with alkaliphilic Bacillus species A-59. All isolates hydrolysed soluble starch as well as amylose, amylopectin and pullulan. The amylase activity (1.2 - 1.8 U ml(-1)) in the culture broths had an optimum temperature of 55 - 65degreesC, was stimulated by 1 mM Ca2+, and was either partially (16 - 30%) or completely inhibited by 1 mM EDTA.

Oxythermal habitat as a primary driver of ecological niche and genetic diversity in cisco (Coregonus artedi)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Cisco (Coregonus artedi) are threatened by climate change and lake eutrophication, and their oxythermal habitat can be assessed with T-DO3, the water temperature at which dissolved oxygen equals 3 mg.L-1. We assessed the influence of T-DO3 on cisco habitat use, genetic diversity, diets, and isotopic niche in 32 lakes ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic. Results showed that as T-DO3 increased, cisco were captured higher in the water column, in a narrower band, with higher minimum temperatures and lower minimum dissolved oxygen. T-DO3 was also negatively related to cisco allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, likely driven by summer kill events. Moreover, T-DO3 influenced the isotopic niche of cisco, as fish captured deeper were more depleted in delta C-13 and more enriched in delta N-15 compared to epilimnetic baselines. Lastly, cisco in high T-DO3 lakes consumed more Daphnia , had fewer empty stomachs, and achieved larger body size. Our work identifies specific characteristics of cisco populations that respond to climate change and eutrophication effects and provides a frame-work for understanding responses of other cold-water species at the global scale.

J	Milner, AM; York, GS				Milner, AM; York, GS			Factors influencing fish productivity in a newly formed watershed in Kenai Fjords National Park, Alaska	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Delusion Creek in McCarty Fjord, southcentral Alaska, was studied over three field seasons from 1992 to 1994 to investigate the factors influencing salmonid colonization and productivity of a new stream system formed by glacial ice recession within the last 40 years. Stream discharge was extremely variable during the summer months. Frequent spate events were a major factor in maintaining an unstable channel and in raising turbidity levels, which limit primary production and the abundance and diversity of invertebrates in the main stream channel available to rearing fish. However, in less than 40 years, coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), pink (O. gorbuscha), and sockeye (O. nerka) salmon have colonized Delusion Creek, and over 1,000 sockeye salmon were observed to spawn along the margin of the upper lake in 1993. Ninety-three percent of juvenile sockeye salmon remained in the takes for two years prior to smolting. Kettle ponds, formed after ice recession, were also found to be important rearing areas for juvenile coho salmon. In the main stream channel, Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) char were the most abundant juvenile rearing fish. Water chemistry of the lakes indicated that nitrogen was likely a limiting nutrient to primary production. Experiments with artificial channels showed that enrichment with nitrogen and phosphorus increased chlorophyll-a levels and macroinvertebrate drift was significantly reduced from enriched channels. We suggest that primary productivity and invertebrate abundance may be enhanced by the colonization of spawning anadromous salmon which may, thus, act as a positive feedback to productivity of this new stream.																			0003-9136					JUL	2001	151	4					627	647																WOS:000170655500006

PHOTOCHEMICAL FORMATION AND STEADY-STATE CONCENTRATIONS IN VARIOUS TYPES OF WATERS	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												For prediction of the rate with which organic compounds are oxidized and photoproducts formed in the aquatic environment by the 1O2 route, the steady-state concentrations of 1O2 in various waters were determined by using furfuryl alcohol as a trapping agent. Under noon, summer sunlight (Switzerland) in lake, river, and wastewaters, surface concentrations were (0.3-3) .times. 10-14 M 1O2 per mg of DOC/L. The more highly colored waters actually tend to produce less 1O2 for a given amount of adsorbed light. Separation of natural aquatic organic compounds by gel permeation chromatography resulted in fractions showing little correlation between 1O2 production efficiency and molecular weight, indicating that large macromolecular structures are not a prerequisite for the sensitization of 1O2 formation. Application of the specific 1O2 concentration data to the estimation of lifetimes of environmental pollutants yields half-lives as short as several hours only for a few especially reactive types of compounds but orders of magnitude longer for most of the compounds expected to be found in the aquatic environment.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				APR	1986	20	4					341	348		10.1021/es00146a005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00146a005								22300204					WOS:A1986A682300008

We previously observed a long-term increase in the compositional variability of phytoplankton in a large shallow lake with a concurrent rise in mean temperature, and we conducted an experimental test of this hypothetical link in a mesocosm system. Following predictions of water temperature for the end of the century, 12 mesocosms were filled with prefiltered and sterilized lake water with six of the tanks kept 3 degrees C above ambient levels. Phytoplankton colonization and subsequent changes in its composition were monitored using microscopic analysis and flow cytometry. Chlorophytes were the most successful colonizers, with no treatment-specific effect on dominant taxa. However, heated mesocosms showed higher variation in community structure (distance-based beta diversity), due to higher variability in subdominant species, a considerable portion of which were flagellated taxa. Our hypothesis of temperature-driven compositional variation was supported by both cytometric and taxonomic data, implying that higher spring temperatures can enhance variability in phytoplankton, which might increase the chance of alternate pathways during succession and reduce the predictability of its annual cycle.

Acoustic and seismic observations of calving events at Bering Glacier, Alaska	BERING GLACIER: INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES OF EARTHS LARGEST TEMPERATE SURGING GLACIER	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The Bering Glacier, located in Southeastern Alaska, extends from the Bagley Ice Field to Vitus Lake, a tidally influenced fresh-water lake draining into the Gulf of Alaska. Calving events from the grounded and floating portions of the terminus are shown to produce both acoustic and seismic signals measurable with infrasound detectors and geophones, respectively. Based on the complex, emergent seismic signals recorded from calving events during a short-term experiment conducted at the Bering Glacier in the summer of 2007, we sought another technique for accurately locating these events. In August 2008 we deployed three small-aperture arrays of infrasound detectors to test their utility at determining the locations of subaerial calving events. Despite the complex nature of both the seismic and acoustic signals generated by calving, through the determination of azimuth from three small arrays of infrasound detectors, we were able to accurately locate both terminus calving and iceberg breakup events without relying on first motion picks for hypocenter locations.					; Waite, Gregory/B-7082-2009; FitzGerald, Katelyn/NKO-7739-2025	Pennington, Wayne/0000-0002-4625-8336; Waite, Gregory/0000-0002-7092-8125; FitzGerald, Katelyn/0000-0003-4184-1917; 													0072-1077		978-0-8137-2462-1				2010	462						327	335		10.1130/2010.2462(17)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2010.2462(17)													WOS:000286213100020

First report of the successful operation of a side stream supersaturation hypolimnetic oxygenation system in a eutrophic, shallow reservoir	WATER RESEARCH												Controlling hypolimnetic hypoxia is a key goal of water quality management. Hypoxic conditions can trigger the release of reduced metals and nutrients from lake sediments, resulting in taste and odor problems as well as nuisance algal blooms. In deep lakes and reservoirs, hypolimnetic oxygenation has emerged as a viable solution for combating hypoxia. In shallow lakes, however, it is difficult to add oxygen into the hypolimnion efficiently, and a poorly designed hypolimnetic oxygenation system could potentially result in higher turbidity, weakened thermal stratification, and warming of the sediments. As a result, little is known about the viability of hypolimnetic oxygenation in shallow bodies of water. Here, we present the results from recent successful tests of side stream supersaturation (SSS), a type of hypolimnetic oxygenation system, in a shallow reservoir and compare it to previous side stream deployments. We investigated the sensitivity of Falling Creek Reservoir, a shallow (Z(max) = 9.3 m) drinking water reservoir located in Vinton, Virginia, USA, to SSS operation. We found that the SSS system increased hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations at a rate of similar to 1 mg/L/week without weakening stratification or warming the sediments. Moreover, the SSS system suppressed the release of reduced iron and manganese, and likely phosphorus, from the sediments. In summary, SSS systems hold great promise for controlling hypolimnetic oxygen conditions in shallow lakes and reservoirs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Regional lake ice meltout patterns near Barrow, Alaska	POLAR GEOGRAPHY												The coastal plain of Arctic Alaska contains many thousands of lakes developed in continuous permafrost, which are ice-free for only 3 -4 months each year. The spatial pattern of lake ice meltout for 1870 lakes (> 10 ha) in a similar to 9200km(2) study area near Barrow, Alaska, is analyzed using five Landsat scenes spanning a 35-year record. For each available year, a spectra-based clustering algorithm is used to differentiate water from ice during springtime meltout and is overlain on a common lake shoreline template to determine the percentage of ice covering each lake. Analysis of these 'e-cover ratios' for each scene reveals that there is pronounced interannual variation in the timing of lake ice meltout. The spatial pattern consistently demonstrates an increase in the percentage of ice coverage on lakes further north, reflecting the regional climatic gradient. However, the ice cover on many lakes near the northeastern coast persists for a substantially longer period into summer due to cooler temperatures associated with onshore winds from the Beaufort Sea. A similar maritime effect is not observed along the Chukchi Sea, and lake ice meltout is not delayed along this littoral zone.					; Sheng, Yongwei/HNP-7933-2023	Lyons, Evan/0000-0003-0863-1619; 													1088-937X	1939-0513					2012	35	1					1	18		10.1080/1088937X.2011.654355	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1088937X.2011.654355													WOS:000211110200001
J	Grassa, F; Favara, R; Valenza, M				Grassa, Fausto; Favara, Rocco; Valenza, Mariano			Moisture source in the Hyblean Mountains region (south-eastern Sicily, Italy): Evidence from stable isotopes signature	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Here the authors present results of an isotope study on precipitation collected during a 2-a period from a rain-gauge network consisting of 6 stations located at different elevations in the Hyblean Mountains (HM) region, in south-eastern Sicily. The slope of the local meteoric water line (delta D = 6.50 delta O-18 + 9.87) obtained for the region suggests that precipitation is affected by evaporation during rainfall events. The main variations in rainwater isotope composition are due to seasonal effects and elevation. An average H-2 excess value of +21.2 parts per thousand was found for precipitation events less affected by evaporation (i.e. when the rainfall was > 65 mm/month). The spatial distribution of O isotope composition of precipitation shows a negative gradient from east and south to the inner areas. The depositional rate of Cl, used as a tracer of the origin of air masses, is highest at the coastal rain-gauges (SR and MRG stations) and lowest on the northern flank of the HM region (SC station). Based on these findings, a model is proposed for the origin of precipitation in the HM region, which assumes that a Mediterranean-derived component is the main source of moisture in the studied area. D/H and O-18/O-16 ratios of inferred meteoric recharge waters were also compared with the isotope composition of waters collected from the main local springs and wells. The best linear fit of the delta O-18 vs delta D relationship for Hyblean groundwater is delta D = 4.85 delta O-18-2.01. The enrichment of heavy isotopes in Hyblean groundwater is probably due to evaporation occurring after precipitation events or to a recharging contribution from surface waters (lakes or rivers) enriched in heavy isotopes.

Out of 250 isolates, 51 bacterial strains were studied for physiological adaptations to their environment (i.e. to the depth layer from which they were obtained). Their salinity and temperature tolerance ranges for growth reflected the very conditions that were measured in the samples of their origin collected in the summer of 1989/1990. These observations indicated that the isolates are capable of growth at the depth of their origin and that they conceivably were endemics. Additionally, a separation of physiologically different populations of heterotrophic bacteria was indicated with respect to the utilization of C-compounds: the uppermost 4 m of the oxylimnion (with frequent water turnover and more extreme temperature conditions) supported primarily sugar-utilizing and halotolerant x-Proteobacteria and Gram-positives. The deeper, hypersaline and heliothermally heated layers ( > 4-24 m) had more moderately halophilic and amino acid-utilizing gamma -Proteobacteria possibly of marine origin.																			0722-4060					MAY	2001	24	5					320	327																WOS:000168622700004

Herpetofaunas from the "overburden'' (Quaternary) of western Canada	EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH												Quaternary herpetofaunas from eight palaeontological localities in western Canada (British Columbia: Bear Flat; Alberta: Eagle Cave, January Cave, Rat's Nest Cave, Hand/Wintering Hills, Fletcher Site, Stampede Site and Little Fish Lake) are described in detail for the first time. Identifications of taxa from these localities include frogs (Rana sp., Bufo sp., and Anura indet.), salamanders (cf. Ambystoma sp.), and snakes (cf. Thamnophis sp. and cf. Pituophis sp.). Preglacial and postglacial herpetofaunas are distinctly separated by a boundary resulting from the advance and retreat of glacial ice across northern North America. The taxonomic records presented here represent a conservative, morphology-based approach to identification that resulted in less taxonomic resolution than is commonly found in literature on Quaternary herpetofaunas. Nonetheless, the resultant data set was useful for establishing a framework that is indicative of biogeographic stability in Quaternary reptiles and amphibians of western Canada. We hypothesise that the observed stability may be related to evolutionary adaptations (e.g. cold-tolerance) in specific lineages.

J	LIAO, CFH; LEAN, DRS				LIAO, CFH; LEAN, DRS			NITROGEN TRANSFORMATIONS WITHIN TROPHOGENIC ZONE OF LAKES	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The uptake rates for ammonia and nitrate were measured in limnocorrals and in the adjacent water in the Bay of Quinte, Ontario [Canada]. Even though the net change of nitrate exceeds that for ammonia over the summer, it is ammonia that is the most significant source of N for the plankton. The uptake rates were light dependent; in the dark uptake of nitrate was reduced 60-95% and ammonia by 40-70%. The uptake of N is not correlated to net production but to gross production. These rates were integrated with sedimentation, N release by zooplankton excretion, and N2-fixation. Although N2-fixation provides only a small amount of the daily N requirement compared with ammonia uptake, ammonia is rapidly recycled and the N2-fixation is the vital process controlling the amount of this essential nutrient in systems where it is in short supply (corral II). Zooplankton grazing and sedimentation (decomposition) can account for much of the ammonia regeneration, but direct release of ammonia from the plankton appeared to be important.																									1978	35	8					1102	1108		10.1139/f78-174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-174													WOS:A1978FG41200006

Demographic patterns of walleye (Sander vitreus) reproductive success in a Wisconsin population	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Harvest in walleye Sander vitreus fisheries is size-selective and could influence phenotypic traits of spawners; however, contributions of individual spawners to recruitment are unknown. We used parentage analyses using single nucleotide polymorphisms to test whether parental traits were related to the probability of offspring survival in Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin. From 2017 to 2020, 1339 adults and 1138 juveniles were genotyped and 66% of the offspring were assigned to at least one parent. Logistic regression indicated the probability of reproductive success (survival of age-0 to first fall) was positively (but weakly) related to total length and growth rate in females, but not age. No traits analyzed were related to reproductive success for males. Our analysis identified the model with the predictors' growth rate and year for females and the models with year and age and year for males as the most likely models to explain variation in reproductive success. Our findings indicate that interannual variation (i.e., environmental conditions) likely plays a key role in determining the probability of reproductive success in this population and provide limited support that female age, length, and growth rate influence recruitment.																			1752-4571					MAR	2024	17	3							e13665	10.1111/eva.13665	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.13665								38468712					WOS:001181796500001

Relative abundance index (height x percent cover) of wetland plants in 630 field quadrats sampled at 13 sites (19992002) were used to derive a model predicting the occurrence of nine herbaceous plant classes with a 71% (24-84%) accuracy. Wetland types included seasonally dry (meadows), mudflats and wet (low marshes and submerged) assemblages. Over the 1961-2002 period, the total surface area of Lake Saint-Pierre herbaceous wetlands ranged between 11 (in 1972) and 128 (in 2001) kin 2 and was negatively correlated (Spearman r = -0.86, p < 0.0001) to average water level during the current growing season. Within-season variability and level conditions over the previous season defined 5 marsh assemblages characterized by different species composition, relative abundance and diversity. Significant hydrological variables included quadrat elevation, water depth, number of days flooded and depth variability experienced over the current and/or previous growth seasons. The hydrological model suggests that for a given level, wetland plant assemblages differed markedly whether the multi-year sequence of water levels was rising or falling. Lake Saint-Pierre alternated between three broad-scale wetland con figurations, dominated by meadows and open marsh with floating-leaved vegetation (in the 1960s), scattered tall Scirpus marshes (in the 1970s and early 1980s) and closed marsh with aggressive emergents (since 1996). The strong response of Lake Saint-Pierre wetlands to hydrological conditions in the current and previous growth seasons underlines their vulnerability to future water level variations resulting from regulation and climate variability.

J	Bonk, A				Bonk, Alicja			Fire occurrence and the current state of palaeofire reconstructions based on sedimentary charcoal from natural archives in Poland	BULLETIN OF GEOGRAPHY-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY SERIES												Due to rising temperatures worldwide many areas are threatened with increasing numbers of fire occurrence. Poland is among these areas and is projected to experience over the next century an increase in both heat stress and wildfire activity with the potential to turn its fire-resistant forests into fire-prone forests. This paper aims to provide an introduction to the conditions favourable to fire occurrence in Poland, summarising the research on sedimentary charcoal analysis and reviewing fire reconstructions based on natural archives from Poland. Here, natural wildfires occurred at the beginning of the Holocene but, due to changes in climate (wetter summers) and vegetation after 6550 BC, the main trigger of fire occurrence became human activity, mainly as a result of forest clearance for agrarian purposes. However, there is evidence that prolonged droughts also triggered wildfires. Over recent decades, according to existing data, arson (44.85%) and negligence (34.43%) have been the most common causes of fire occurrence in Poland.

J	Yin, JF; Wang, DH; Xu, HB; Zhai, GQ				Yin JinFang; Wang DongHai; Xu HuanBin; Zhai GuoQing			An investigation into the three-dimensional cloud structure over East Asia from the CALIPSO-GOCCP Data	SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES												The spatial distribution of clouds and their seasonal variations, and the three-dimensional (3D) cloud structures over East Asia have been analyzed with the CALIPSO-GOCCP data during the period from 2007 to 2012. The results show that there is a large cloud fraction greater than 0.7 over southern China, and the largest cloud fraction appears in southwest China. Besides, a large cloud fraction occurs over the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau. The total and high cloud fractions show notable variations with seasons, while the middle and low cloud fractions vary a little. As for cloud vertical structure, significant differences of the cloud vertical distributions are observed between over land and ocean. Cloud fractions and the height of the maximum cloud fractions decline gradually with the increasing latitude, except for the vertical-latitude profiles over the Tibetan Plateau regions. The longitude-vertical cross sections show similar patterns from the longitude 70A degrees E to 140A degrees E, except the profiles with large cloud fractions over the Tibetan Plateau. From the horizontal distribution patterns and vertical structures of the clouds over East Asia, it is concluded that the huge terrain of the Tibetan Plateau has significant impacts on the cloud formation over the Tibetan Plateau region and the areas to the east. At last, the clouds from the CALIPSO-GOCCP observations are compared to those from the ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The results indicate that the ERA-Interim reanalysis data provide reasonable spatial distribution patterns and the vertical structures in terms of the total cloud fraction over East Asia. However, the total cloud fraction was underestimated about 20% by the ERA-Interim reanalysis data over most parts of East Asia, especially over the neighboring areas east of the Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, the ERA-interim reanalysis data overestimate the cloud fractions at each level in the vertical direction.

Sulfur and chlorine compounds in water bodies of the Pymvashor subarctic hydrothermal system	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The results of the study of the behavior of redox-dependent sulfur and chlorine compounds in sediments of water bodies of the Pymvashor natural boundary (PNB) located in the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra (the Polar Cis-Ural Region, Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russian Federation) are presented. Currently, the Pymvashor is the only known location in Continental Europe where hydrothermal springs function in the polar territories. Data on the quantitative characteristics of the geochemical parameters of bacterial sulfate reduction (reduced sulfur compounds, reactive iron forms, and organic matter) in the sediments of all studied Pymvashor water bodies have been obtained. It has been established that the revealed differences in the distribution and transformation of these parameters, in addition to the main reasons affecting the course of redox processes, were also caused by the thermal factor (warming effect of thermal waters on all ecosystems of the natural boundary). Thus, iron monosulphides dominated in the upper sediment layers of non-freezing watercourses, which distinguished them from the sediments of seasonally frozen lakes, where sulfur associated with organic matter dominated along the entire length of the sediment cores. The presence of chlorophenols (CPs) and their derivatives, including pentachlorophenol as a persistent organic pollutant, in the sediments of studied Pymvashor water bodies was established. It is shown that the chlorophenol composition is mainly induced by the occurrence of natural enzymatic and biochemical processes. The influence of microclimatic conditions of the subarctic hydrothermal system on the composition, levels, and distribution of chlorophenolic compounds in the sediments was revealed.					; Kolpakova, Еlena/AFJ-5310-2022; Velyamidova, Anna/ABD-5962-2020; Kokryatskaya, Natalia/V-4986-2017; Титова, Ксения/HHZ-2774-2022; , Natalia/V-4986-2017	Velyamidova, Anna/0000-0001-6183-3397; , Ksenia/0000-0001-7664-7706; , Natalia/0000-0002-0619-7241; Kolpakova, Elena/0000-0002-8291-7191													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2023	30	10					27328	27339		10.1007/s11356-022-24141-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-24141-y		NOV 2022						36378376					WOS:000884195300015

During 1975-1988, PNP caribou fluctuated around a carrying capacity of 24, but after 1988 the population declined, falling to 5 individuals by 2009. Caribou are now likely extirpated from PNP, even in the absence of any local or increased anthropogenic disturbance since the protected area was created in 1978. As moose (Alces alces) in the region declined concurrently, their relative density remained higher along the Lake Superior coastal strip than further inland, the reverse of the situation during 1975-1988; moose especially held to the coast during heavy snow years. Wolves (Canis lupus) accordingly shifted more of their hunting effort to the coast, likely encountering both moose and caribou with increasing search efficiency. These behaviours are described as a predator-prey "space race" that wolves eventually won.																			1195-6860						2014	21	3-4					374	386		10.2980/21-(3-4)-3700	http://dx.doi.org/10.2980/21-(3-4)-3700													WOS:000363283300015

The majority of the production occurred during March and April and was due to an unidentified species of Dunaliella. Daily C fixation rates averaged 2.13 g C m-2 at both locations during this period. A minor phytoplankton bloom in Aug., due to a small, unidentified green flagellate contributed 5% of the total annual phytoplankton production. Phytoplankton production was probably limited during April by self-shading and during the remainder of the year by the availability of N, as shown by laboratory bioassays. Grazing by Artemia salina reduces the phytoplankton population in late summer when nutrient levels have partially increased due to regeneration. The meromictic character of the lake was indicated by profiles of temperature and density. The monimolimnion is postulated to act as a nutrient sink, reducing the rate of nutrient release to the mixolimnion.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1976	21	1					74	87		10.4319/lo.1976.21.1.0074	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1976.21.1.0074													WOS:A1976BM14000007

It was found in the effects of a former colonial mining engineer and may have been an observed fall. The texture, mineralogy, petrography, magnetic properties and chemical and isotopic compositions are consistent with classification as a CM2 chondrite. There are similar to 45 vol.% high-temperature components mainly Type I chondrules (with olivine mostly Fa(0-2), mean Fa(0.9)) with granular textures because of low mesostasis abundances. Type II chondrules contain olivine Fa(7) to Fa(76). These are dominantly of Type IIA, but there are IIAB and IIB chondrules, II(A) B chondrules with minor highly ferroan olivine, and IIA(C) with augite as the only pyroxene. The refractory inclusions in Paris are amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs) and fine-grained spinel-rich Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs). The CAI phases formed in the sequence hibonite, perovskite, grossite, spinel, gehlenite, anorthite, diopside/fassaite and forsterite. The most refractory phases are embedded in spinel, which also occurs as massive nodules. Refractory metal nuggets are found in many CAI and refractory platinum group element abundances (PGE) decrease following the observed condensation sequences of their host phases. Mn-Cr isotope measurements of mineral separates from Paris define a regression line with a slope of Mn-53/Mn-55 = (5.76 +/- 0.76) x 10(6). If we interpret Cr isotopic systematics as dating Paris components, particularly the chondrules, the age is 4566.44 +/- 0.66 Myr, which is close to the age of CAI and puts new constraints on the early evolution of the solar system. Eleven individual Paris samples define an O isotope mixing line that passes through CM2 and CO3 falls and indicates that Paris is a very fresh sample, with variation explained by local differences in the extent of alteration. The anhydrous precursor to the CM2s was CO3-like, but the two groups differed in that the CMs accreted a higher proportion of water. Paris has little matrix (similar to 47%, plus 8% fine grained rims) and is less altered than other CM chondrites. Chondrule silicates (except mesostasis), CAI phases, submicron forsterite and amorphous silicate in the matrix are all well preserved in the freshest domains, and there is abundant metal preserved (metal alteration stage 1 of Palmer and Lauretta (2011)). Metal and sulfide compositions and textures correspond to the least heated or equilibrated CM chondrites, Category A of Kimura et al. (2011). The composition of tochilinite-cronstedtite intergrowths gives a PCP index of similar to 2.9. Cronstedtite is more abundant in the more altered zones whereas in normal highly altered CM chondrites, with petrologic subtype 2.6-2.0 based on the S/SiO2 and Sigma FeO/SiO2 ratios in PCP or tochilinite-cronstedtite intergrowths (Rubin et al., 2007), cronstedtite is destroyed by alteration. The matrix in fresh zones has CI chondritic volatile element abundances, but interactions between matrix and chondrules occurred during alteration, modifying the volatile element abundances in the altered zones. Paris has higher trapped Ne contents, more primitive organic compounds, and more primitive organic material than other CMs. There are gradational contacts between domains of different degree of alteration, on the scale of similar to 1 cm, but also highly altered clasts, suggesting mainly a water-limited style of alteration, with no significant metamorphic reheating.

J	MOORE, JW				MOORE, JW			SOME FACTORS INFLUENCING DENSITY OF INVERTEBRATES NEAR A SEWAGE OUTFALL	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The factors influencing the density of benthic and planktonic invertebrates near a sewage outfall on Great Slave Lake in the Canadian subarctic were determined between June 1975 and May 1977. Densities were measured along 3 transects extending 500 m from the outfall and at 3 stations located 0.5-6.0 km from the outfall. Almost all benthic (Chironomus decorus, procladius denticulatus, Polypedilum nebeculosum, Tanytarsus sp., Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Pontoporeia affinis, Pisidium casternatum, Valvata sincera helicoidea) and planktonic (Keratella earlinae, Kellicottia longispina, Synchaeta stylata) species increased in abundance moving towards the sewage discharge point. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the elevated levels of algae and the total amount of food available in the environment had little if any influence on all species. Detritus and associated bacteria were the most important factors affecting densities and were probably the major food source for all species. Low winter O2 levels (10-60% staturation), water depth and temperature had negligible effect on most species.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1978	61	1					81	93		10.1007/BF00019027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00019027													WOS:A1978FT82900010

The proportion of fixed allelic differences (56.3%, 9 of 16 loci) between the species falls within the range accepted for valid species. A strict host specificity of E. crassum and E. salvelini for their typical host (lake trout, Arctic charr, respectively) was found in the French localities examined (Lake Annecy, Lake Bourget). For E. salvelini, polymorphism with the established allelic profile was found in the acid phosphatase (ACP) system. No significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations for ACP were found in either of the E. salvelini populations, which suggests predominantly cross-fertilization of these hermaphrodites. Analysis of the standardized variance in allelic frequencies demonstrated almost no among population differentiation (estimator theta of F-st=-0.03) between E. salvelini populations.

Two samples obtained from the water column under the ice cover (5 and 20 m deep) in March 2016 have been deep sequenced and the reads assembled to generate metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that are representative of the microbes living in this special environment. Compared with freshwater bodies studied around the world, Lake Baikal had an unusually high fraction of Verrucomicrobia. Other groups, such as Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, were in proportions similar to those found in other lakes. The genomes (and probably cells) tended to be small, presumably reflecting the extremely oligotrophic and cold prevalent conditions. Baikal microbes are novel lineages recruiting very little from other water bodies and are distantly related to other freshwater microbes. Despite their novelty, they showed the closest relationship to genomes discovered by similar approaches from other freshwater lakes and reservoirs. Some of them were particularly similar to MAGs from the Baltic Sea, which, although it is brackish, connected to the ocean, and much more eutrophic, has similar climatological conditions. Many of the microbes contained rhodopsin genes, indicating that, in spite of the decreased light penetration allowed by the thick ice/snow cover, photoheterotrophy could be widespread in the water column, either because enough light penetrates or because the microbes are already adapted to the summer ice-less conditions. We have found a freshwater SAR11 subtype I/II representative showing striking synteny with Pelagibacter ubique strains, as well as a phage infecting the widespread freshwater bacterium Polynucleobacter. IMPORTANCE Despite the increasing number of metagenomic studies on different freshwater bodies, there is still a missing component in oligotrophic cold lakes suffering from long seasonal frozen cycles. Here, we describe microbial genomes from metagenomic assemblies that appear in the upper water column of Lake Baikal, the largest and deepest freshwater body on Earth. This lake is frozen from January to May, which generates conditions that include an inverted temperature gradient (colder up), decrease in light penetration due to ice, and, especially, snow cover, and oligotrophic conditions more similar to the open-ocean and high-altitude lakes than to other freshwater or brackish systems. As could be expected, most reconstructed genomes are novel lineages distantly related to others in cold environments, like the Baltic Sea and other freshwater lakes. Among them, there was a broad set of streamlined microbes with small genomes/intergenic spacers, including a new nonmarine Pelagibacter-like (subtype I/II) genome.

Lake Michigan lower food web: Long-term observations and Dreissena impact	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Michigan has a long history of non-indigenous introductions that have caused significant ecological change. Here we present a summary of eight papers that document recent changes and the current state of the lower food web of southern Lake Michigan after the establishment of large dreissenid populations. Results are based on long-term data sets collected by federal and academic research and monitoring programs that place recent changes into a historic context. Dramatic and significant changes in the lower food web, such as the loss of the spring diatom bloom, large declines in phytoplankton productivity, and a decline of Mysis populations, were directly or indirectly attributed to the expansion of Dreissena rostriformis bugensis. Total phosphorus concentrations and loadings also have decreased in the last 20 years. Changes in the Lake Michigan ecosystem induced by D. r. bugensis have produced conditions in the offshore pelagic region that are similar to oligotrophic Lake Superior. The future state of the lower food web in southern Lake Michigan is difficult to predict, mainly because population trends of D.r. bugensis in cold, offshore regions are unknown. Hence, monitoring programs designed to collect long-term, consistent data on the lower food web of Lake Michigan are essential. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Our research explores the linkages between climate evolution in the North Atlantic and in the Alps between 30.6 and 12.5 ka, This period, centered on the Last Glacial Maximum, experienced the most recent phase of maximum global ice volume, corresponding to a millennia-long phase of sea-level lowstand, minima in reconstructed sea surface temperatures and isotopic values from polar ice. We present a high-resolution multiproxy record from Lake Fimon at the southern Alpine foothills, where a larch forest-steppe persisted throughout the coldest spells. We analyse the fine climate structure of the MIS 3-2 transition, of the Alpine Last Glacial Maximum stepped by HS2, and provide an unprecedented fine resolution and accurate 14C dating of the Last Glacial Maximum and the early Alpine Lateglacial. We reconstructed quantitative climate parameters based on sensitive pollen descriptors, and derived co -registered sedimentary proxies for dust flux. Reconstructed series suggest that extreme continental spells in the Alps and cold boreal winters match the timing of Heinrich Stadials 2 and 1, episodes of iceberg discharge and release of rock fragments (Ice Rafted Debris) in the North Atlantic. The initiation of the LGM at 27.3 ka is marked by a 4 degrees C drop in July temperatures, likely responsible for the onset of glacial build-up in the Southern Alpine piedmont. The first extreme continental spell coincides with the British -Irish-sourced IRD event at 26.2 ka and with glacier retreat in the Southern Alps, persisting in the sub-sequent HS2. Late Glacial glacier collapse and extreme drought occurred during the first half of the HS1, 17.4-16.2 ka. The comparison of the results obtained at Lake Fimon with other terrestrial Eurasian re-cords and with recalibrated marine chronologies from the North Atlantic suggests in-phase reactions of the British-Irish Ice Sheet and of Alpine glaciers and ecosystems to changes in the Atlantic Meridional Circulation. Asymmetric ecoclimatic effects produced by North Atlantic events at the windward and leeward sides of the Alps confirm a southern provenance of moist air masses throughout the LGM.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

PRIMARY PRODUCTION BY PHYTOPLANKTON IN SELECTED SALINE ECOSYSTEMS	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Primary production by phytoplankton, efficiency of photosynthesis and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined for 7 saline lakes that varied in ionic concentration and composition. Investigations were during the summer of 1972-1973. Productivity ranged from 0.001-11.135 g C/m3 per day and 0.053-7.968 g C/m2 per day. Highest productivities were measured in 2 lakes that supported blooms of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Nodularia spumigena, respectively. Species of Cyanophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae dominated the phytoplankton of the study lakes. Active chlorophyll-a ranged from 0.01-116 mg m3. Integral photosynthetic efficiency estimates were < 1% except during phytoplankton blooms when they were considerably higher. The overall range of 0.03-3.8% agrees with estimates for other lacustrine ecosystems. Extinction of light caused by photosynthetic processes, or in situ efficiency, was < 1% in the trophogenic zone for most lakes but it was higher during blooms. In situ efficiencies increased with depth in all lakes.																			0020-9309						1978	63	3					337	351		10.1002/iroh.19780630304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19780630304													WOS:A1978FS65800003

Using compositional and textural characteristics we identified 14 facies classified in biogenic, clastic and volcaniclastic groups, in which diatoms and other algal remains are the most common components. In addition to facies analysis, high-resolution geochemical data from continuous core scanning XRF and the analysis of discrete samples for organic and inorganic carbon content, provide the basis for palaeoclimatic reconstruction. The age model indicates that the record spans from 9.4 cal ka bp toad 1760. Three main phases in the sequence are identified, controlled by millennial-scale variability. During the period between 9.4 and 5.7 cal kabp, the lake is dominated by siliceous organisms. Drier conditions between 8.2 and 6.3 cal kabp are linked to decreases in summer insolation and solar irradiance. By 5.7 cal kabp, the change in sedimentation is related to the increase in El Nino Southern Oscillation frequency. Evidence of the occurrence of dry conditions during the archaeological Late Classic period (ad 600-900) and historical droughts are also documented in the Alberca de Tacambaro record. Unprecedented changes in the landscape are recorded afterad 1520.

Combining field data, laboratory experiments, and long-term simulations, we retrieved 30 + year evolution of Cu in surface sediments (SCu). SCu evolution between 1983 and 2015 may be separated into two distinguishable periods. During the first period (1983-2003), SCu underwent a continuous increase at a mean rate of 1.80 mg/kg/yr; however, since 2003 it displayed a stepwise reduction tendency. The average SCu concentration of the entire lake in 2015 fell to 54.26 mg/kg, which is approximately 30.01% lower than that in 2003. The operation of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) markedly altered the river-lake relationship, pulled more deposited Cu along with sediment out toward the Yangtze River, and made the regions of high SCu emanate from the southeastern lake extend northwestward between 2003 and 2015. SCu in the reserves showed significant inter-annual variations, with the exception of the Jiangxi Whitebait Spawning Reserve (JWSR), where SCu generally has not been significantly impacted and has displayed no departure from the 30 + year mean of 30.57 mg/kg. The National Germplasm Reserve (NGR) and Nanjishan National Nature Reserve (NNNR) were detected with the highest SCu, with the peak concentrations, respectively, of 123.15 mg/kg and 103.1 mg/kg.

Yet, to date no continuous delta O-18 and only few delta H-2 records are available from loess-paleosol sequences. Taking advantage of a recently developed method based on compound-specific delta O-18 analyses of hemicellulose sugar biomarkers in soils (Zech and Glaser, 2009. RCM 23, 3522-3532), we here present a first terrestrial delta O-18 biomarker record from an eolian permafrost paleosol sequence in NE-Siberia that covers the last similar to 220 ka. The delta O-18 values of the hemicellulose biomarkers arabinose and xylose range from 22.5 to 32.8% and from21.3 to 31.9%, respectively, and reveal systematic glacial-interglacial shifts. The modern topsoil and the interglacial paleosols exhibit more positive delta O-18 values, whereas the glacial paleosols are characterized by more negative delta O-18 values. This is in agreement with the delta H-2 record obtained for sedimentary n-alkane leaf wax biomarkers. We present a conceptual model for interpreting the combined delta O-18 and delta H-2 biomarker record. Based on this model, we suggest that both our delta O-18 and the delta H-2 records primarily reflect the temperature-controlled isotopic composition of paleoprecipitation modified by evaporative isotope enrichment of leaf water during transpiration. Considering fractionation factors during sugar and n-alkane biomarker biosynthesis allows reconstructing the leaf water isotopic composition and the deuterium excess of the leaf water. The deuterium excess may serve as proxy for evaporative enrichment and allows calculating relative humidity using a Craig-Gordon model. Accordingly, relative humidity in NE-Siberia was higher during marine isotope stage (MIS) 6 compared to MIS 2, 4 and 5d and thus could help explaining the much larger extent of the Late Saalian glaciation compared to the Weichselian glaciations. Using the Craig-Gordon model, we also calculated delta O-18 of the plant source water (delta O-18(source water)), which can be assumed to primarily reflect delta O-18 of paleoprecipitation. Our 220 ka delta O-18(source water) record is well in agreement with the delta O-18(diatom) record from Crater Lake El'gygytgyn in NE-Siberia and enables a regional paleoclimate reconstruction and interpretation. Accordingly, summer temperature was periodically warmer than at present during the Weichselian glacial period and there is a strong July insolation forcing of the summer temperature in the extremely continental study area. Overall, our study highlights the great potential of the novel hemicellulose biomarker delta O-18 method for paleoclimate reconstructions, especially when combined with delta H-2 analyses of n-alkane lipid biomarkers.

Distances covered by some sturgeons during spawning migrations show a positive relationship to average adult size. The lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, is the only sturgeon endemic to the Great Lakes basin. Most remaining populations in the basin are restricted in movement, yet a few, free-ranging populations still remain. Study of these populations will more adequately define range and habitat preferences of the species. Some state and federal agencies are now creating management plans for lake sturgeon. Those plans need to be based on information gathered from free-ranging groups. A barrier-free 250-300 km combined river and lake range is suggested as a minimum distance to support self-sustaining populations and distances of 750-1000 km should not be considered unusual. Fishery managers should give barrier removal or fish passage greater consideration than habitat enhancement for populations currently isolated and restricted in range.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1996	53			1			152	160		10.1139/f95-276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-276													WOS:A1996VK06200017

The high-altitude wetlands (HAWs) in the Central Andes are unique ecosystems located in the Altiplano that provide many ecosystem services. The objective of this study was to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of the environmental conditions associated with varying hydrology of the HAW, Salar de Tara, in the Andean Altiplano. Sediment samples of up to 20 cm in depth were obtained from various salt flat sub-environments. The samples were analyzed using proxies for mineralogical and chemical composition, thermal analysis, and magnetic susceptibility. Diatom and ostracod communities were also identified and analyzed. The results reflected changes in the geochemistry, carbon content, mineralogy, and magnetic properties of the sediments that can be explained by variations in the sources of water input to the Salar de Tara. The sub-environments depend on the supply of water via the groundwater recharge of springs adjacent to the streamflow from the Zapaleri River, which promotes greater diversity and richness of genera. Our results suggest that water extraction at industrial levels greatly impacts the persistence of hydrologically connected HAWs, which concentrate a worldwide interest in brine mining.

J	SYTSMA, MD; ANDERSON, LWJ				SYTSMA, MD; ANDERSON, LWJ			BIOMASS, NITROGEN, AND PHOSPHORUS ALLOCATION IN PARROTFEATHER (MYRIOPHYLLUM-AQUATICUM)	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Seasonal patterns in allocation of biomass, nitrogen, and phosphorus in parrotfeather, Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verd., were determined in a north-central California lake. Submersed rhizomes comprised 72 to 98% of the total biomass. Emergent biomass never comprised more than 24% of the total biomass. Allocation to emergent biomass was greater in shallow (< 0.5 m) than in deep (0.5 - 1.5 m) sites on the dates sampled. The submersed growth form was an important component of the biomass only during winter when it accounted for a maximum of 3% of the biomass. There was no accumulation of biomass between June and September 1989, which suggests that biomass loss rates equalled production rates during the growing season. Rhizome N concentration, but not P or C concentrations, increased during the growing season. Allocation of N and P in parrotfeather varied with season and depth. Rhizomes contained 42 to 89% of the total N pool. The proportion of N in emergent tissues from deep plots decreased from 30% in June to < 10% in September. Rhizomes contained only 3% of the total P pool, 80% of the parrotfeather P was in emergent tissues. Parrotfeather appeared to rely upon current uptake of P for growth rather than on stored P, which suggests that reduction in P supply may effectively reduce growth, and may partially explain the limited distribution of parrotfeather and its lack of aggressive invasion of aquatic macrophyte communities in some areas. The allocation of P and the lack of P storage may make parrotfeather succeptible to a harvesting strategy that removes only the emergent growth, especially in P-limited stands.

The species starting to breed in this area later than in the western Baltic Sea and North Sea regions, which were first colonised in the 1970s and early 1980s respectively. Since then, the breeding distribution has continued to expand through Lake Ladoga to Lake Onega in northwest Russia, which currently forms the north-easternmost limit of the range for of this temperate-breeding population. Nowadays, Barnacle Geese in the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland breed later than in other Baltic counties, including neighbouring Finland. The egg-laying period, which starts between 1 May-25 June and peaks during 11-25 May, is longer than for Barnacle Geese nesting in western parts of the temperate zone and also in comparison with those breeding in the Russian Arctic. The mean dutch size of 4.95 (s.e. +/- 0.07) eggs is however larger than in other parts of the Baltic and in Arctic areas. Nests were found only on islands occupied by Herring Gulls Larus argentatus, which is the most common predator of Barnacle Goose eggs in the region. The Herring Gulls' egg-laying period lasted from April to June; thus, incubation of Barnacle Goose eggs occurs during the gulls' nesting and brood rearing period. It is suggested that anthropogenic disturbance could adversely affect Barnacle Goose breeding success in the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland, through tourist activity displacing geese from their nests at a time when the gulls are also breeding nearby. Specific features of the environment (late spring, predation risk and tourist activity) and the characteristics of this particular goose population (recent colonisation of the area, small population size and late breeding period) should be taken into account in developing conservation management programmes for geese in the region.

Concentrations of SPM (g m-3) were not as strongly correlated to the beam attenuation coefficient (c, [m-1]), as were concentrations of the inorganic SPM fraction. Apparently, this was caused by large optically inactive organic particles which significantly affected the measurements of SPM, but had little effect on the attenuation of light. When the water column was thermally stratified, SPM concentrations in the BBL showed a seasonal increase which was related to an increase in the thermocline depth. As the epilimnion deepened, there was also a marked increase in the occurrence of rapid and large changes in SPM concentration. After the loss of stratification, the amount of SPM and the temporal variability in its concentration was reduced. Since surface waves could not influence sediment resuspension at the depth of measurement, these data show the importance of internal waves in promoting sediment resuspension in areas of sediment accumulation. The relatively short period in each summer, when the thermocline reaches a sufficient depth to allow for resuspension over accumulation bottoms, can have important consequences for both the redistribution of lake sediments and the internal loading of phosphorus.

"MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN STARVING": ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE DONNER FAMILY CAMP	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY												In spring of 1846, the George and Jacob Donner families and some 80 traveling companions began their overland trek to California. When the party ascended the Sierra Nevada in late October, a snowstorm forced the group to bivouac. At this point, the train became separated into two contingents; the larger party camped near Donner Lake and the smaller group including the Donner families-settled at Alder Creek. Though written accounts from the Lake site imply many resorted to cannibalism, no such records exist for Alder Creek. Here we present archaeological findings that support identification of the Alder Creek camp. We triangulate between historical context, archaeological traces of the camp, and osteological remains to examine the human condition amid the backdrops of starvation and cannibalism. A stepped analytical approach was developed to examine the site's fragmentary bone assemblage (n = 16,204). Macroscopic and histological analyses indicate that the emigrants consumed domestic cattle and horse and procured wild game, including deer rabbit, and rodent. Bladed tools were used to extensively process animal tissue. Moreover; bone was being reduced to small fragments; pot polish indicates these fragments were boiled to extract grease. It remains inconclusive, however, whether such processing, or the assemblage, includes human tissue.

A Holocene Perspective on Algal Mercury Scavenging to Sediments of an Arctic Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Anthropogenic activities have increased the amount of mercury (Hg) transported atmospherically to the Arctic. At the same time, recent climate warming is altering the limnolog of arctic lakes and ponds, including increases in aquatic primary production. It has been hypothesized that climate-driven increases in aquatic production have enhanced Hg scavenging from the water column, and that this mechanism may account for much of the recent rise in lake sediment Hg. Here, we test the relationship between climate, algal production, and sediment Hg using a well-dated and multiproxy lake sediment record spanning the Holocene from Lake CF3 (Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada). During the early Holocene, peak (summer) insolation drove July air temperatures higher than present, and resulted in increased autochthonous primary production as recorded by total organic matter, spectrally inferred Chl-a, diatom abundance, and carbon stable isotopic signatures. However, there are no relationships between any of these proxies and sediment Hg concentrations during this interval. Given that the behavior of preindustrial Hg was relatively stable during past intervals of naturally mediated high production, we surmise that postindustrial increases in Hg accumulation within CF3 reflect a multiplicative effect of atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic Hg and increased sedimentation rates.

B	Nelson, V		Howe, C; Mitchell, C		Nelson, Valerie			Achieving the water commons - the role of decentralised systems	WATER SENSITIVE CITIES	Cities of the Future Series											Traditional water management has relied on an industrial-scale engineering and economic model developed in the 1800's. With a goal of public health protection, big pipe systems were built to transport clean water in and wastewater out of urban neighborhoods. Low water and sewer rates have been based on extraction of water as a free natural resource, moving water from one basin to another, moving mass volumes of fresh water into brackish and salt water environments, and dumping wastes into the environment with minimal penalty. The damage from these approaches is manifested in eutrophied lakes and estuaries, falling levels of groundwater and streamflows, loss of habitat, absorption of toxins by humans and other organisms, and reductions in public health and community well-being, particularly in low-income, marginalized communities. An emerging water paradigm relies instead on design principles found in nature: in particular, integrated systems, efficiency and reuse, and adaptation to local conditions. These 'smart, clean, and green' approaches create a wealth of services and benefits at the local level in cities and towns and can help restore the ecological and societal well-being of the 'Water Commons' as well.																					978-1-84339-364-1; 978-1-78040-092-1				2012							9	28																WOS:000314519700003

However, changes to oxythermal regimes due to drawdown are reservoir specific and interface with fish species-specific habitat requirements, producing varying effects on coldwater fish populations. We examined the effect of drawdown on the oxythermal habitat and relative abundance of kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka, a coldwater salmonid, in Island Park Reservoir on the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, Idaho. A measure of relative kokanee abundance was negatively, exponentially related to drawdown. Oxythermal patterns measured in the reservoir during 2021, a severe drought year, revealed that drawdown reduced kokanee habitat by increasing water temperatures and decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations. Oxythermal refugia for kokanee appeared to relate to inflow from the spring-fed Henrys Fork and other groundwater inflows. However, we did not quantify groundwater flow or connections, and we did not study kokanee population demographics or mortality. Reducing these sources of uncertainty is a priority for future study. Still, our study highlights a potential mechanism connecting reservoir drawdown to fish populations and the unique yet predictable mechanisms by which reservoir drawdown interacts with reservoir morphometry to affect fish habitat availability.					; Mabaka, Arthur/JLM-4078-2023; Van Kirk, Robert/JWA-6569-2024	McLaren, John/0000-0001-5899-1212; Mabaka, Arthur/0009-0000-1299-2017													0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2023	43	2					339	351		10.1002/nafm.10879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10879													WOS:000963800400006

Localized precipitation and runoff on Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												We use the Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (MRAMS) to simulate lake storms on Mars, finding that intense localized precipitation will occur for lake size >= 10(3) km(2). Mars has a low-density atmosphere, so deep convection can be triggered by small amounts of latent heat release. In our reference simulation, the buoyant plume lifts vapor above condensation level, forming a 20 km high optically thick cloud. Ice grains grow to 200 mm radius and fall near (or in) the lake at mean rates up to 1.5 mm h(-1) water equivalent (maximum rates up to 6 mm h(-1) water equivalent). Because atmospheric temperatures outside the surface layer are always well below 273 K, supersaturation and condensation begin at low altitudes above lakes on Mars. In contrast to Earth lake-effect storms, lake storms on Mars involve continuous precipitation, and their vertical velocities and plume heights exceed those of tropical thunderstorms on Earth. For lake sizes 10(2.5) to 10(3.5) km, plume vertical velocity scales linearly with lake area. Convection does not reach above the planetary boundary layer for lakes << 10(3) km(2) or for atmospheric pressure >O(10(2)) mbar. Instead, vapor is advected downwind with little cloud formation. Precipitation occurs as snow, and the daytime radiative forcing at the land surface due to plume vapor and storm clouds is too small to melt snow directly (<+10 W m(-2)). However, if orbital conditions are favorable, then the snow may be seasonally unstable to melting and produce runoff to form channels. We calculate the probability of melting by running thermal models over all possible orbital conditions and weighting their outcomes by probabilities given by long-term integrations of the chaotic diffusion of solar system orbital elements. With this approach, we determine that for an equatorial vapor source, sunlight 15% fainter than at present and snowpack with albedo 0.28 (0.35), melting may occur with 4% (0.1%) probability. This rises to 56% (12%) if the ancient greenhouse effect was modestly (6 K) greater than today.					; Manga, Michael/D-3847-2013	Manga, Michael/0000-0003-3286-4682; 													2169-9097	2169-9100				JUL 13	2011	116								E07002	10.1029/2010JE003783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JE003783													WOS:000292834600001

Landscape evolution associated with the 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption in Iceland	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption in Iceland developed between the outlet glacier Dyngjujokull and the Askja central volcano and extruded a bulk lava volume of over 1 km(3) onto the floodplain of the jokulsa a Fjollum river, making it the largest effusive eruption in Iceland during the past 230 years. Time-series monitoring using a combination of traditional aerial imaging, unmanned aerial systems, and field-based geodetic surveys, established an unprecedented record of the hydrological response of the river system to this lava flow. We observed: (1) the formation of lava-dammed lakes and channels produced during dam-breaching events; (2) percolation of glacial meltwater into the porous and permeable lava, forming an ephemeral hydrothermal system that included hot pools and hot springs that emerged from the lava flow front; and (3) the formation of new seepage channels caused by upwelling of water around the periphery of the lava flow. The observations show that lava flows, like the one produced by the 2014-2015 Holuhraun eruption, can cause significant hydrological changes that continue for several years after the lava is emplaced. Documenting these processes is therefore crucial for our interpretation of volcanic landscapes and processes of lava-water interaction on both Earth and Mars. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We provide evidence that parasites may affect trophic transfer in aquatic food webs. Many phytoplankton species are susceptible to parasitic fungi (chytrids). Chytrid infections of diatoms in lakes may reach epidemic proportions during diatom spring blooms, so that numerous free-swimming fungal zoospores (2-3 mu m in diameter) are produced. Analysis shows that these zoospores are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and sterols (particularly cholesterol), which indicates that they provide excellent food for zooplankters such as Daphnia. In life-table experiments using the large diatom Asterionella formosa as food, Daphnia growth increased significantly in treatments where a parasite was present. By grazing on the zoospores, Daphnia acquired important supplementary nutrients and were able to grow. When large inedible algae are infected by parasites, nutrients within the algal cells are consumed by these chytrids, some of which, in turn, are grazed by Daphnia. Thus, chytrids transfer energy and nutrients from their hosts to zooplankton. This study suggests that parasitic fungi alter trophic relationships in freshwater ecosystems and may be the important components in shaping the community and the food-web dynamics of lakes.					von Elert, Eric/S-1666-2018; Kagami, Maiko/L-4430-2018; van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Ibelings, Bas/B-4237-2011	von Elert, Eric/0000-0001-7758-716X; Kagami, Maiko/0000-0003-3086-390X; van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; 													0962-8452					JUN 22	2007	274	1617					1561	1566		10.1098/rspb.2007.0425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.0425								17439852					WOS:000246844800016

Two Decades of Dust Radiative Forcing on Snow Cover Across the Great Salt Lake Basin	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Seasonal snowpacks in mountain drainages of the Great Salt Lake Basin (GSLB), western United States, are the primary surface water supply to regional agriculture, the metropolitan Wasatch Front, and the terminal Great Salt Lake. Spring dust emissions from the eastern Great Basin result in a dust-darkened GSLB snowpack, locally accelerating snowmelt relative to dust-free conditions. Such acceleration has been linked to streamflow forecasting errors in the adjacent Colorado River Basin, but snow darkening impacts within the GSLB are largely uninvestigated. To quantify the dust impact, we analyzed patterns in dust radiative forcing (RFdust) over the MODIS record (2001-2023) using spatially and temporally complete RFdust and fractional snow-covered area products. For validation, retrievals were cross-referenced with in situ RFdust observations. Results showed that RFdust was present every year and had no significant trend over the record. Spatially, RFdust was similar across all three subbasins. Temporally, RFdust exhibited high interannual variability (-30 to +40 Wm-2 from record means) and has declined slightly in regions of the eastern GSLB. Controls of RFdust may be linked to seasonal meteorology and drought conditions, but drivers remain uncertain. Further understanding of the distribution and controls of RFdust in the GSLB during changing climate and weather patterns may allow us to predict snowmelt more accurately.					; Mallia, Derek/JFK-8237-2023	Mallia, Derek/0000-0003-1983-7305; Adams, Bradley/0000-0003-1129-6292; Lang, Otto/0000-0002-3435-5032													2169-9003	2169-9011				FEB	2025	130	2							e2024JF007957	10.1029/2024JF007957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JF007957													WOS:001423826400001

The water body is divided into three depth strata, the mixolimnion, chemocline and monimolimnion, each defined by distinct values of temperature, electrical conductivity and oxygen concentration. Typical for meromictic lakes, the monimolimnion remains perennially anoxic and is rich in dissolved solids and nutrients. The annual pattern of particle flux in Lake Suminko is closely related to biochemical processes in the euphotic zone. During winter months we observed very low accumulation rates of non-carbonaceous matter, while during the rest of the year, three periods of calcite deposition were recorded (April, July-August, and October-November). The periods of high calcite deposition corresponded with algal blooms and oxygen concentration maxima. Two principal factors contribute to meromixis in Lake Suminko: (1) the basin is sheltered, preventing wind mixing, and (2) biochemical processes in the lake associated with high lacustrine productivity. Meromictic conditions must control the formation and preservation of laminated sediments in the lake because preserved laminations occur only in areas where the lake floor lies below monimolimnetic waters.

J	VINCENT, WF				VINCENT, WF			PRODUCTION STRATEGIES IN ANTARCTIC INLAND WATERS - PHYTOPLANKTON ECO-PHYSIOLOGY IN A PERMANENTLY ICE-COVERED LAKE	ECOLOGY												Three distinct population strategies occurred within the summer algal plankton of Lake Fryxell (Taylor Valley, South Victoria Land, 77.degree.35''S, 163.degree.15''E). Phytoplankton immediately under the ice (Ochromonas and Chlamydomonas) were adapted to relatively bright light but were limited by N availability. A deep maximum of Chroomonas and Pyramimonas was recorded at the bottom of the euphotic zone. This community did not respond to N or P enrichment. It was highly shade adapted but at this depth ambient irradiance was below that required to saturate photosynthesis. Net population increases in the upper and lower euphotic communities occurred very early in the season. Flagellated algae in the middle of the oxygenated water column swam up to depths of greater light during the day and returned to lower depths of greater nutrient supply at night. These mid-euphotic populations continued to grow throughout midsummer. Comparisons with other Dry Valley lakes suggest that nutrient supply, rather than in situ light or temperature, determines the large lake-to-lake and depth variations in primary productivity. Nutrient availability appears to conrol algal biomass, but in contrast to arctic ecosystems, low light rather than low temperature dampens algal photosynthesis to cellular rates that are well below those recorded at lower latitudes. The complexity of production strategies in Lake Fryxell and the occurrence of population maxima early in the season when sampling is logistically difficult, challenge the view that the desert lakes of Antarctica offer ideal and simple systems for limnological study.

The analysis of n-alkanes indicated the likely periods of regression and transgression from c. 8300?7950 cal. a BP and from c 7950?7665 cal. a BP that agrees well with the reconstructed sea-level changes from the sediment characteristics and pollen records. The steady abundance of mangrove pollen taxa in the sediment core points to a standstill in the sea-level from 7650?6870 cal. a BP. However, the results from the n-alkanes analysis further suggested a sea-level fall at c. 7650?7610 cal. a BP and at c. 7400?6870 cal. a BP, and a sea-level rise at c. 7610?7400 cal. a BP. Furthermore, these sea-level changes were intervened by short intervals of regression centered at c.7590 and 7470 cal. a BP.

J	CLARKE, AH				CLARKE, AH			ASIAN APPLE SNAIL, CIPANGOPALUDINA-CHINENSIS (VIVIPARIIDAE) IN ONEIDA LAKE, NEW-YORK	NAUTILUS												On Sept. 11, 1977, about 60 specimens of C. chinensis (Gray 1834) (= Viviparus japonicus (von Martens) and V. molleatus (Reeve)) were found washed up along a quarter mile stretch of beach at Sylvan Beach, Oneida County, New York [USA], at the eastern end of Oneida Lake. Many of the specimens contained decaying soft parts but circumstances prevented a proper search for live animals. On April 30, 1978, the site was revisited and additional, apparently freshly-dead, specimens were found. On this occasion, diving for live specimens could not be attempted but the presence of an established colony in Oneida Lake, and probably at Sylvan Beach, appears certain. Although C. chinensis occurs elsewhere in New York State, i.e., near Niagara Falls and near New York City, it was not found previously in Oneida Lake nor in the Finger Lakes region. Expansion of its distribution throughout central New York, by way of the Erie Barge Canal, should probably be expected.																			0028-1344						1978	92	3					134	134																WOS:A1978FG18300011

Cold montane steppe, dominated by sagebrush, covered much of the western Bonneville Basin prior to 13,000 yr ago. From 13,000-10,800 yr ago, the region was vegetated by limber pine woodlands in lower montane settings and a mosaic of limber pine and sagebrush steppe along basin floor margins. These low-elevation timber pine woodlands began to retreat upslope after about 11,000 yr ago due to increasingly drier climatic conditions, and were replaced by relatively more xeric desert scrub dominated by sagebrush and shadscale. The growth of limber pine at low elevations suggests that summer temperatures were as much as 6 degrees C tower than at present, This evidence is in apparent conflict with the currently accepted post-Prove Lake Bonneville chronology, especially the magnitude of the postulated near-dessication of Lake Bonneville from ca. 13,000-12,200 yr ago.

These climate boundaries are not stationary and shift geographically, depending on long-term atmospheric conditions. So far, little is known about past shifts of these climate boundaries and the local to regional environmental response prior to the instrumental era. High resolution multi-proxy data (stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios, S/Ca and Sr/Ca) from two Holocene stalagmites from Blessberg Cave (Thuringia) are used here to differentiate local and pan-regional environmental and climatic conditions Central Germany through the Holocene. Carbon isotope and S/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios inform us on local Holocene environmental changes in and around the cave, while delta O-18 (when combined with independent records) serves as proxy for (pan-)regional atmospheric conditions. The stable carbon isotope record suggests repeated changes in vegetation density (open vs. dense forest), and increasing forest cover in the late Holocene. Concurrently, decreasing S/Ca values indicate more effective sulfur retention in better developed soils, with a stabilization in the mid-Holocene. This goes in hand with changes in effective summer infiltration, reflected in the Sr/Ca profile. Highest Sr/Ca values between 4 ka and 1 ka BP indicate intensified prior calcite precipitation resulting from reduced effective moisture supply. The region of Blessberg Cave is sensitive to shifts of the boundary between maritime (Cfb) and continental (Dfb) climate and ideally suited to reconstruct past meridional shifts of this divide. We combined the Blessberg Cave delta O-18 time series with delta O-18 data from Bunker Cave (western Germany) and a North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) record from lake SS1220 (SW Greenland) to reconstruct the mean position of the Cfb-Dfb climate boundary. We further estimate the dynamic interplay of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Siberian High and their influence on Central European climate. Repeated shifts of the Cfb-Dfb boundary over the last 4000 years might explain previously observed discrepancies between proxy records from Europe. Detailed correlation analyses reveal multi-centennial scale alternations of maritime and continental climate and, concurrently, waning and waxing influences of Siberian High and NAO on Central Europe.					; Breitenbach, Sebastian/AAB-1420-2019; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Scholz, Denis/G-1861-2016; Marwan, Norbert/D-9576-2011; Goswami, Bedartha/AAZ-6789-2020	Breitenbach, Sebastian/0000-0001-9615-2065; Schroder, Birgit/0000-0003-4807-6357; Goswami, Bedartha/0000-0002-2302-166X; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Scholz, Denis/0000-0002-0055-8915; Marwan, Norbert/0000-0003-1437-7039; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				MAY	2019	176						144	161		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.03.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.03.007													WOS:000465364600011

Combining Satellite, Teleconnection, and In Situ Data to Improve Understanding of Multi-Decadal Coastal Ice Cover Dynamics on Earth's Largest Freshwater Lake	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE												To differentiate and understand drivers behind coastal ice cover trends and variability, we advance development of a model combining satellite, in situ, and teleconnection data along the shoreline of Earth's largest freshwater lake (Lake Superior). Previous studies suggest a regime shift in Lake Superior's ice cover starting in 1998. Our study includes seven years of new data and subsequent model analysis that provide new insight into characteristics of the post-1998 regime. In addition to providing a valuable extension to the historical ice cover record for this domain, we find the regime shift in coastal ice cover starting in 1998 is characterized by pronounced variability, and not simply a shift in pre-1998 trends. Our findings represent an important stepping stone for future ice and climate modeling not only on Lake Superior but across the entire Great Lakes region and in other global high-latitude coastal regions as well.					; Rood, Richard/C-5611-2008	Gronewold, Andrew/0000-0002-3576-2529; Rood, Richard/0000-0002-2310-4262														2333-5084				DEC	2024	11	12							e2024EA003845	10.1029/2024EA003845	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024EA003845													WOS:001369951800001

Kamali			Regional frequency analysis of autumnal floods in the province of Quebec, Canada	NATURAL HAZARDS												A large number of models have been proposed over the last years for regional flood frequency analysis in northern regions. However, these models dealt generally with snowmelt-caused spring floods. This paper deals with the adaptation, application, and comparison of two regional frequency analysis methods, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and universal canonical kriging (UCK), on autumnal floods of 29 stations from the Cte-Nord region (QC, Canada). Three possible periods during which autumnal floods can take place are tested. The absolute and specific flood peak and volume quantiles are also studied. A jack-knife resampling procedure is applied to compare the performance of each model according to the selected period and the type of quantile. The period of September 1st to December 15th is found to be optimal to represent autumnal floods and specific quantiles were shown to lead to better results than absolute quantiles. Variables that explain best the autumnal floods are the basin area, the fraction of the area covered with lakes, and the average of mean July, August, and September maximal temperatures. The CCA model performs slightly better than UCK.																			0921-030X	1573-0840				NOV	2011	59	2					681	698		10.1007/s11069-011-9789-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-011-9789-5													WOS:000295577300005
J	Sayer, CD; Davidson, TA; Jones, JI				Sayer, Carl D.; Davidson, Thomas A.; Jones, John Iwan			Seasonal dynamics of macrophytes and phytoplankton in shallow lakes: a eutrophication-driven pathway from plants to plankton?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Seasonal relationships between macrophyte and phytoplankton populations may alter considerably as lakes undergo eutrophication. Understanding of these changes may be key to the interpretation of ecological processes operating over longer (decadal-centennial) timescales. 2. We explore the seasonal dynamics of macrophytes (measured twice in June and August) and phytoplankton (measured monthly May-September) populations in 39 shallow lakes (29 in the U.K. and 10 in Denmark) covering broad gradients for nutrients and plant abundance. 3. Three site groups were identified based on macrophyte seasonality; 16 lakes where macrophyte abundance was perennially low and the water generally turbid ('turbid lakes'); 7 where macrophyte abundance was high in June but low in August ('crashing' lakes); and 12 where macrophyte abundance was high in both June and August ('stable' lakes). The seasonal behaviour of the crashing and turbid lakes was extremely similar with a consistent increase in nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll-a over May-September. By contrast in the stable lakes, seasonal changes were dampened with chlorophyll-a consistently low (< 10-15 mu g L-1) over the entire summer. The crashing lakes were dominated by one or a combination of Potamogeton pusillus, Potamogeton pectinatus and Zannichellia palustris, whereas Ceratophyllum demersum and Chara spp. were more abundant in the stable lakes. 4. A long-term loss of macrophyte species diversity has occurred in many shallow lakes affected by eutrophication. One common pathway is from a species-rich plant community with charophytes to a species-poor community dominated by P. pusillus, P. pectinatus and Z. palustris. Such compositional changes may often be accompanied by a substantial reduction in the seasonal duration of plant dominance and a greater tendency for incursions by phytoplankton. We hypothesise a slow-enacting (10-100 s years) feedback loop in nutrient-enriched shallow lakes whereby increases in algal abundance are associated with losses of macrophyte species and hence different plant seasonal strategies. In turn such changes may favour increased phytoplankton production thus placing further pressure on remaining macrophytes. This study blurs the distinction between so-called turbid phytoplankton-dominated and clear plant-dominated shallow lakes and suggests that plant loss from them may be a gradual process.

David			Turbulent Fluxes and Pollutant Mixing during Wintertime Air Pollution Episodes in Complex Terrain	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Cold air pools (CAPs) are stagnant stable air masses that form in valleys and basins in the winter. Low wintertime Insolation limits convective mixing, such that pollutant concentrations can build up within the CAP when pollutant sources are present. In the western United States, wintertime CAPs often persist for days or weeks. Atmospheric models do not adequately capture the strength and evolution of CAPs. This is in part due to the limited availability of data quantifying the local turbulence during the formation, maintenance, and destruction of persistent CAPs. This paper presents observational data to quantify the turbulent mixing during two CAP episodes in Utah's Salt Lake Valley during February of 2004. Particulate matter (PM) concentration data and turbulence measurements for CAP and non-CAP time periods indicate that two distinct types of mixing scenarios occur depending on whether the CAP is dry or cloudy. Where cloudy, CAPs have enhanced vertical mixing due to top-down convection from the cloud layer. A comparison between the heat and momentum fluxes during 5 days of a dry CAP episode in February to those of an equivalent 5 day time period in March with no CAP indicates that the average turbulent kinetic energy during the CAP was suppressed by approximately 80%.					; Holmes, Heather/G-4789-2016	Pardyjak, Eric/0000-0002-0180-0857; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 17	2015	49	22					13206	13214		10.1021/acs.est.5b02616	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b02616								26451471					WOS:000365151200014
J	Hänninen, J; Vuorinen, I				Hanninen, Jari; Vuorinen, Ilppo			Time-Varying Parameter Analysis of the Baltic Sea Freshwater Runoffs	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT												The Baltic Sea runoff events during 1970-2000 were analysed with non-linear estimation in order to find potential stability and time-varying (non-constancy) properties of time series parameters. In the Baltic Sea area, the wintertime rainfall is expected to increase, especially in the northern parts of the watershed; furthermore, seasonality is expected to decrease, i.e. the runoffs will become more evenly distributed over seasons, mainly by decreasing springtime peaks. We found a general increase in runoffs over the time period studied that consisted of a level shift upwards during the early 1980s. The runoffs considerably resulted from inputs in the months of April to June (which points to the significance of winter precipitation) and are biased to northern parts of the catchment. Our results suggest that this is connected with snow and ice melting in the northern areas of the watershed, especially in the subarctic catchment area of the Neva River (the area includes, for example, three of the four biggest lakes in Europe, Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega and Lake Saimaa, which are annually covered by ice). The yearly variation in runoff is significantly stabilised by large N-S extension of the watersheds of these lakes. The results are generally in accordance with the presented climatic expectations; however, decreasing seasonality was not obvious in the series yet. However, we found potential implications of system change towards decreased seasonality. By better understanding of ongoing processes in the sea, the results can give us an opportunity to better evaluate the system control, predicted areal consequences and ecosystem effects of the climate change. The analysis proved to be a sensitive tool for studying climatic variation in a relatively small area and over a short time span.

However, studying diet patterns (e.g., spatial and seasonal changes) can require extensive effort. Using individual analyses to interpret patterns may be further complicated by assumptions and limitations of the analytical approach. We investigated and compared predicted adult lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) diet composition and patterns using stomach content analysis (SCA), fatty acid analysis (FAS), and stable isotope analysis (SIA) individually and simultaneously. The three analyses were conducted for fall-captured fish in Lake Ontario and provided different diet composition estimates; SCA suggested alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) was dominant by frequency and mass, while FAA and SIA suggested rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) contributed the most based on similarity among fatty acid signatures and two-stable isotope (carbon and nitrogen) mixing models, respectively. We hypothesize the disagreement among diet estimates is a result of a seasonal shift in diet variably expressed due to differing extent of time reflected by the diet metric: hours to days for SCA, weeks to months for FAA and several months for SIA. Despite variability in diet composition estimates among methods, similar patterns in lake trout diet were observed among the three diet analyses; the contribution of alewife in lake trout diet was greater for larger individuals and for males compared to females, particularly in the east and northeast regions of the lake where alewife density was relatively low. Thus, the complementary results from the three analyses suggest that length, location, sex, and season all influence lake trout diet. Individually, analyses often failed to identify these patterns in lake trout diet with significance, and some of the patterns have not been observed in previous studies of lake trout diet in Lake Ontario. The thorough description of lake trout diet obtained from a single sampling season demonstrates how simultaneous use of multiple diet analyses may allow investigation of spatial and seasonal diet composition and with reduced sampling effort.					; Gorsky, Dimitry/AGI-7846-2022; Futia, Matthew/LVS-0786-2024	Colborne, Scott/0000-0002-0143-8456; Gorsky, Dimitry/0000-0003-1708-539X; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2021	127								107728	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107728		MAY 2021											WOS:000659187000003

Karst hydrogeological observations in Tra Linh and Quang Uyen districts, Cao Bang province, Vietnam	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The Tra Linh and Quang Uyen Districts are located in Cao Bang Province, Northeastern Vietnam, where abundant rainfall combined with considerable soluble limestones of Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian ages support a spectacular tower karst landscape. This paper is a comprehensive study based on geologic, tectonic, and hydrogeological observations in the Tra Linh and Quang Uyen Districts, Cao Bang Province, Vietnam, enhanced with water-quality samples collected from 31 sites. Each location was sampled once, in March 2012 or February 2014, except Hang Ban Lang (HQ-31) and Hang Ban Nua (HQ-32) springs, which were sampled twice to determine variability in water quality. The water samples were analyzed for physical proprieties and chemical and isotopic composition. To better understand the impact of the lithologic factor to the development of the karst landscape in the study area, two rock samples were collected and analyzed during the 2014 trip. Four additional rock samples were collected for comparison from areas located in similar humid subtropical climate as the study area; three from Thailand and one from Alabama, USA. The data and analyses presented herein are performed for the first time in the study area. Results showed that groundwater quality met US drinking-water standards, with only manganese exceeded secondary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in seven samples. Specific conductance values for the water samples ranged from 153.2 to 421.6 mu S/cm. The pH values ranged from 6.51 to 8.29, total hardness (as CaCO3) was between 85 and 326mg/L, the total alkalinity as CaCO3 varied from 68 to 207mg/L, and carbon dioxide varied between 32.4 and 123.4mg/L. The water chemistry is dominated by calcium. The highest concentrations of calcite were recorded in the rock samples collected in Vietnam. The water samples collected in the Cao Bang Province are depleted in both O-18 and deuterium with a d-excess value above10 parts per thousand and have a median value of 13.16 parts per thousand. Some samples exhibited lesser (three samples with values under 10; a sinking stream, a karst window, and a lake) or higher deuterium excess values due to local variations in humidity, temperature, and wind speed. The data set reported here only represents a local and time-limited snapshot of the water isotopic compositions. Further studies are required to confirm our preliminary results from Cao Bang Province.					; TUDOR, Ioan/Z-1245-2019	TUDOR, Ioan Albert/0000-0003-2964-6764; 													0891-2556	1878-5212				DEC	2018	33	4					579	600		10.1007/s13146-018-0447-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13146-018-0447-9													WOS:000450279500001

Whether or not it occurred, and whether or not the heterotrophic activity method can be used to measure it, was studied in this acidified lake. For sampling 1, linearity between turnover time (t/f) and added substrate concentration (A) did not exist at the in situ pH (3.2) or the experimental pH (5.5 and 7.0), even though time studies showed that glucose was mineralized at measurable rates. For sampling 2, modifications were made to the concentrations of labeled glucose and the incubation time. A highly significant linear relationship between t/f and A was demonstrated, and the turnover time and Vmax were calculated to be 472.3 h and 0.005 .mu.g/l-1 h-1, respectively. For sampling 3, even though the environmental conditions were similar to those for the previous sampling, a statistically-significant relationship between t/f and A did not result.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1984	18	5					609	612		10.1016/0043-1354(84)90211-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(84)90211-2													WOS:A1984SP05500016

Seasonal Evolution of Supraglacial Lakes on Baltoro Glacier From 2016 to 2020	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The existence of supraglacial lakes influences debris-covered glaciers in two ways. The absorption of solar radiation in the water leads to a higher ice ablation, and water draining through the glacier to its bed leads to a higher velocity. Rising air temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns provoke an increase in the supraglacial lakes in number and total area. However, the seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes and thus their potential for influencing mass balance and ice dynamics have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. We present a summertime series of supraglacial lake evolution on Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram from 2016 to 2020. The dense time series is enabled by a multi-sensor and multi-temporal approach based on optical (Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X) remote sensing data. The mapping of the seasonal lake evolution uses a semi-automatic approach, which includes a random forest classifier applied separately to each sensor. A combination of linear regression and the Hausdorff distance is used to harmonize between SAR- and optical-derived lake areas, producing consistent and internally robust time series dynamics. Seasonal variations in the lake area are linked with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) based on air temperature and precipitation data derived from the climate reanalysis dataset ERA5-Land. The largest aggregated lake area was found in 2018 with 5.783 km(2), followed by 2019 with 4.703 km(2), and 2020 with 4.606 km(2). The years 2016 and 2017 showed the smallest areas with 3.606 and 3.653 km(2), respectively. Our data suggest that warmer spring seasons (April-May) with higher precipitation rates lead to increased formation of supraglacial lakes. The time series decomposition shows a linear increase in the lake area of 11.12 +/- 9.57% per year. Although the five-year observation period is too short to derive a significant trend, the tendency for a possible increase in the supraglacial lake area is in line with the pronounced positive anomalies of the SPI and STI during the observation period.					; Braun, Matthias/S-4693-2016; Erbertseder, Thilo/HFZ-9947-2022; Braun, Matthias/A-4968-2009; Mayer, Christoph/AAD-6696-2019	Wendleder, Anna/0009-0005-1534-4732; Erbertseder, Thilo/0000-0003-4888-1065; Schmitt, Andreas/0000-0002-0232-2666; Braun, Matthias/0000-0001-5169-1567; 														2296-6463				DEC 24	2021	9								725394	10.3389/feart.2021.725394	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.725394													WOS:000743977600001

Data on the breeding phenology, the seasonal dynamics of the food composition of breeding gulls, the foraging distance and the breeding success are considered. These data are compared to the results obtained earlier for Lake Kurilskoe. Both gull populations are unique in that they are the only fresh-water colonies within the distribution range of this marine species. The breeding success of slaty-backed gulls on Lake Kronotskoe suffers from predation, both intra-and interspecific, in the latter case from brown bears and sea eagles. The hatching period and the chicks fledging time in this population are both shifted to the end of summer, when gulls have the most abundant food available within the lake area, this increasing a successful survival of the fledglings. Despite considerable differences between the ecosystems of Lake Kronotskoe and Lake Kuril'skoe, there are several features shared in the diet of the gull populations living on the lakes. 1. Despite gulls performing foraging flights to the sea coast, they only take fish and almost never collect marine invertebrates there. 2. Nearly half of all food items are taken within a 40-km distance from the colony. 3. During the chick-growth period, gulls from both lakes rely on salmonids (anadromous in Lake Kuril'skoe, resident in Lake Kronotskoe) they hunt in the lakes near their colonies.

The lagoon exhibited the highest PHC concentration during summer, attributed to higher boat activity and mixing of PHC from bottom sediment. For PHC in both the water of the lagoon and regions adjacent to jetties, the northern sector exhibited highest concentrations, followed by the southern, outer channels and central sectors, in order. The highest PHC level was due to the highest density of fishing boat operations and maintenance activities, as well as the resuspension of lake sediments across the shallowest region of the lagoon. The PHC found in the water and sediment in the jetty regions were relatively high in comparison to the rest of the lagoon, again attributed to the maintenance and operational activities of the motorised boats in the jetties. The sediment PHC concentration was approximate to 1000 times higher than the respective value for water, which could result from long-term deposition. The overall PHC concentration in the lagoon and jetties was found to be under the threshold limit and hence there is no risk to the existing biodiversity of the Chilika Lagoon.

The results showed that the concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (C2H3Cl3), 1,1-dichloroethene (C2H2Cl2), 1,1,2-trichloroethene (C2HCl3), trichloromethane (CHCl3) and tetrachloromethane (CCl4) in the surface water were 0.31-4.81, 2.75-21.3, 1.21-17.1, 5.02-233 and 0.045-4.47 pmol/L, respectively, with the average values of 1.89, 12.20, 6.93, 60.90 and 0.33 pmol/L. On the whole, the horizontal distributions of C2H3Cl3, C2H2Cl2 and CCl4 were affected mainly by anthropogenic activities, while C2HCl3 and CHCl3 were influenced by biological factors as well as anthropogenic activities. In the study area, the concentrations of VHCs (except C2HCl3) exhibited a decreasing trend from inshore to offshore sites, with the higher values occurring in the coastal waters. The sea-to-air fluxes of C2H3Cl3, C2HCl3, CHCl3 and CCl4 were calculated to be -56.00-(-5.68), -7.31-123.42, 148.00-1 309.31 and -83.32-(-1.53) nmol/(m(2).d), respectively, with the average values of -6.77, 17.14, 183.38 and -21.27 nmol/(m(2).d). Our data showed that the SYS and ECS in autumn was a sink for C2H3Cl3 and CCl4, while it was a source for C2HCl3 and CHCl3 in the atmosphere.					; Yang, Gui-Peng/GZG-6468-2022	Yang, Gui-Peng/0000-0002-0107-4568; 													0253-505X	1869-1099				FEB	2015	34	2					9	20		10.1007/s13131-015-0622-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13131-015-0622-y													WOS:000349912400002

Alternative ecological pathways in the Eastern Lake Ontario food web-round goby in the diet of lake trout	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) range expansion and their possible inclusion ill the diet of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) were investigated. Fish community index bottom trawls in eastern Lake Ontario (Kingston basin) during summer 2003 and 2004 indicated the presence (of the round goby at relatively low densities (3.72 X 10(-2) + 5.24 x 10(-3) fish/m(2)) in depths up to 30 m. Lake trout (mean fork length = 585 +/- 78 mm and mean weight = 2.770 +/- 1.134 g) stomach contents showed round goby to be the secowl most abundant diet item at almost 20% by number (36% by mass). Round goby ingested by lake trout ranged in total length from 50 to 110 mm. The most important prey species in terms of abundance (68%) and mass (56%) was alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). Alewives were the most important diet item for all sizes of lake trout sampled, except those in the 550 - 650 mm size class, which ingested more round goby by mass than alewife. Round goby range expansion to deep water and prominence in the diet of lake trout signal significant change in the eastern Lake Ontario food web.																			0380-1330						2006	32	2					395	400		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[395:AEPITE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[395:AEPITE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000239185200015

Animal bioturbation preserved in Pleistocene magadiite at Lake Magadi, Kenya Rift Valley, and its implications for the depositional environment of bedded magadiite	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Magadiite, a rare hydrous sodium-silicate mineral [NaSi7O13(OH)(3)center dot 4(H2O)], was discovered about 50 years ago in sediments around Lake Magadi, a hypersaline alkaline lake fed by hot springs in the semi-arid southern Kenya Rift Valley. Today this harsh lacustrine environment excludes most organisms except microbial extremophiles, a few invertebrates (mostly insects), highly adapted fish (Alcolapia sp.), and birds including flamingos. Burrows discovered in outcrops of the High Magadi Beds (similar to 25-9 ka) that predate the modern saline (trona) pan show that beetles and other invertebrates inhabit this extreme environment when conditions become more favourable. Burrows (cm-scale) preserved in magadiite in the High Magadi Beds are filled with mud, silt and sand from overlying sediments. Their stratigraphic context reveals upward-shallowing cycles from mud to interlaminated mud-magadiite to magadiite in dm-scale units. The burrows were formed when the lake floor became fresher and oxygenated, after a period when magadiite precipitated in shallow saline waters. The burrows, probably produced by beetles, show that trace fossils can provide evidence for short-term (possibly years to decades) changes in the contemporary environment that might not otherwise be recognised or preserved physically or chemically in the sediment record.

J	Cáceres, CE; Schwalbach, MS				Cáceres, CE; Schwalbach, MS			How well do laboratory experiments explain field patterns of zooplankton emergence?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We conducted a laboratory experiment to explore potential mechanisms driving variation in zooplankton emergence from diapausing eggs observed in Oneida Lake, NY, U.S.A. We hypothesized that variation in timing of ice-out (date of thawing of ice) between 1994 and 1995, which resulted in variation in photoperiod-temperature cues, contributed to the differences in the observed field patterns. Environmental chambers were used to establish weekly photoperiod-temperature combinations that reproduced natural conditions in Oneida Lake in 1994 and 1995. In addition, a third treatment ('dark') exposed eggs only to the changes in temperature. We recorded zooplankton emergence for 2.5 simulated ice-free seasons. 2. Nine cladoceran taxa were found to hatch, but only Daphnia pulicaria in large numbers. Hatching of D. pulicaria was recorded throughout the season in the two light treatments and sporadically in the dark treatment. The early ice-out treatment had the highest emergence, followed by the late ice-out and dark treatments. Among taxa, there was temporal segregation with five hatching in the early weeks of sampling and two taxa hatching during the middle weeks. Alona hatched late in the first year, but earlier in the second year. 3. We compared our laboratory results of D. pulicaria hatching with the field data obtained by Caceres (1998). Hatching was continuous in the laboratory, whereas a synchronous spring emergence was found in the field. However, in both the laboratory and the field, more D. pulicaria hatched under conditions reflecting ice-out occurring in March as opposed to April. Because differences in rates and timing of emergence can affect the population and community dynamics of pelagic systems, we suggest caution when applying laboratory results to field populations.																			0046-5070					SEP	2001	46	9					1179	1189		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00737.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00737.x													WOS:000171284900003

In this study, sedimentation losses of Scenedesmus in the mixed lake are compared with those in the stratified lake. Sedimentation losses were much lower in the mixed lake and this can explain the higher number of cells of non-buoyant algae. Sedimentation losses of Scenedesmus were also investigated in experimental plankton towers with mixed layers of 2 and 10 metres depth. The sedimentation losses in the deep mixed tower were much lower than in the shallow mixed tower and this can explain the higher net increase of cells, despite the lower average irradiance experienced by the plankton in the deep mixed tower. A simple model was used to relate the growth rate and loss processes to mixing depth. This allowed a reconstruction of the phytoplankton population dynamics for the summer period for the stratified and mixed lake on basis of determined Z(eu)/Z(m) ratios. These calculations illustrate the decisive impact of the mixing depth on the phytoplankton population dynamics.

We used the number of whitefish larvae stocked annually and the mean age of gillnetted whitefish as input variables, while data on annual whitefish yield and YCS were used to validate the model. The following factors affecting survival of the larvae were tested: intra- and interspecific competition, predation, fishing pressure, weather, zooplankton density and quality, effect of the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens on the density of phyllopods, the preferred food of larger whitefish larvae. Our modeling results indicated that weather conditions in May negatively influenced YCS and yield. Thus, it sustained our hypothesis that gas supersaturation, resulting from intensive oxygen production by algae during sunny weather in spring, caused lethal gas bubble syndrome in Lake Hallwil whitefish larvae. Our modeling results further indicated that high phyllopod densities in May were associated with strong year classes.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						343	358																WOS:000180355400029

Steppe, which covered the area some time before 9000 BP (all ages are given in C-14 BP), was replaced by boreal conifer forest-steppe by 9000-8500 BP. At the same time, planktonic diatoms increased in abundance from 5 to 45%. After 4000 BP there was a sharp reduction in forest and re-establishment of steppe. Changes in the pollen composition were accompanied by a decrease in the abundance of planktonic diatoms from 35-50% (between 9000 and 5500 BP) to less than 10% soon after 4000 BP. These and other published data from Mongolia suggest wetter conditions during the early and middle Holocene than those of today. This pattern probably reflects an expansion of the Pacific monsoon recorded in geological data from China and simulated in climate-model experiments, and suggests that the summer monsoon influenced a larger area than might appear if the Chinese records only are taken into consideration.						/0000-0002-7219-5009; Nadezhda, Dorofeyuk/0000-0001-6953-8384													0300-9483					JUN	2000	29	2					117	126																WOS:000087951600003
J	Happel, A; Rinchard, J; Czesny, S				Happel, Austin; Rinchard, Jacques; Czesny, Sergiusz			Variability in sea lamprey fatty acid profiles indicates a range of host species utilization in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Despite being a "top predator"/parasite in the Great Lakes, knowledge of sea lamprey feeding ecology remains hindered by methodological constraints. Particularly, our knowledge of sea lamprey dietary habits is likely biased as it relies primarily on wounding rates of commercially and recreationally caught fish. Biochemical methods provide a means to extract diet information from sea lamprey themselves, and therefore provide a more objective assessment of sea lamprey feeding ecology. Of particular interest is the use of fatty acid profiles to qualitatively describe foraging patterns of sea lamprey. Adult sea lamprey were captured throughout the Lake Michigan basin during spring spawning migrations into rivers, and muscle tissues were analyzed for fatty acid profiles. Exploratory multivariate analyses were used to investigate variation in fatty acid profiles among captured individuals and to compare these to profiles of potential host species. In general, we noted a large variability in fatty acid profiles suggesting a broad spectrum of host species targeted by sea lamprey. Comparing sea lamprey fatty acid profiles with published data on host species, we concluded that sea lamprey feed on a wide variety of host species.

Cladophora in the Great Lakes: impacts on beach water quality and human health	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Cladophora in the Great Lakes grows rapidly during the warm summer months, detaches, and becomes free-floating mats as a result of environmental conditions, eventually becoming stranded on recreational beaches. Cladophora provides protection and nutrients, which allow enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, enterococci, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella to persist and potentially regrow in the presence of the algae. As a result of wind and wave action, these microorganisms can detach and be released to surrounding waters and can influence water quality. Enteric bacterial pathogens have been detected in Cladophora mats; E. coli and enterococci may populate to become part of the naturalized microbiota in Cladophora; the high densities of these bacteria may affect water quality, resulting in unnecessary beach closures. The continued use of traditional fecal indicators at beaches with Cladophora presence is inadequate at accurately predicting the presence of fecal contamination. This paper offers a substantial review of available literature to improve the knowledge of Cladophora impacts on water quality, recreational water monitoring, fecal indicator bacteria and microorganisms, and public health and policy.

Numerous fossil fishes and plants have been recovered from this site and described. The dearth of insect fossils is surprising considering their richness in other deposits of similar origin and age. We suggest that the rich fish fauna present in the oxygen-rich parts of the water in the former volcanic crater lake may have scavenged most of the terrestrial insects that fell into the water. Although the fossil described here is undoubtedly that of a member of the Scarabaeoidea, the family placement remains unsure. Significance: We describe the first Eocene fossil scarab from Africa.

The method consists of direct measurement of environmental parameters, and it indirectly incorporates a nutrients budget analysis to estimate the submarine groundwater fluxes. Three-dimensional numerical modeling of water quality has been used with the directly collected data and the indirectly estimated groundwater fluxes. The applied area is Saemangeum tidal lake that is enclosed by 33km-long sea dyke with tidal openings at two water gates. Many investigations of groundwater impact reveal that 10 similar to 50% of nutrient loading in coastal waters comes from submarine groundwater, particularly in the macro-tidal flat, as in the west coast of Korea. Long-term monitoring of coastal water quality signals the possibility of groundwater influence on salinity reversal and on the excess mass outbalancing the normal budget in Saemangeum tidal lake. In the present study, we analyze the observed data to examine the influence of submarine groundwater, and then a box model is demonstrated for quantifying the influx and efflux. A three-dimensional numerical model has been applied to reproduce the process of groundwater dispersal and its effect on the water quality of Saemangeum tidal lake. The results show that groundwater influx during the summer monsoon then contributes significantly, 20% more than during dry season, to water quality in the tidal lake.

The major determinants of year-class success were overwintering egg survival and the amount of food available to larval lake-whitefish during the first 7 weeks of life. Egg mortality was related to the timing of ice cover, with an early cold winter producing the highest survival. Larval was affected by the abundance of availabile prey i.e., copepod zooplankton between the sizes of 0.7 and 1.1 mm in total length. In 1983, when zooplankton of this size were abundant relative to larval fish density, high rates of growth and survival of lake whitefish ensued. In 1984, the prey-per-fish ratio declined greatly, and poor growth and low survival were observed. The dynamics of these early life stages appear to significantly influence both lake whitefish year-class strength and eventual recruitment in Grand Traverse Bay.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	1990	119	1					92	100		10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0092:EOEALS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0092:EOEALS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1990DP99000011

Historically, TYR activity has been blocked by anoxia resulting from persistent waterlogging; however, recent events of prolonged summer drought have boosted TYR activity and, consequently, the release of carbon stored in the form of organic compounds from peatlands. Since 30% of the global soil carbon stock is stored in peatlands, a profound understanding of the production and activity of TYRs is essential to assess the impact of carbon dioxide emitted from peatlands on climate change. TYR partial sequences identified by degenerated primers suggest a versatile TYR enzyme community naturally present in peatlands, which is produced by a phylogenetically diverse spectrum of bacteria, including Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. One full-length sequence of an extracellular TYR (SzTYR) identified from a soda-rich inland salt marsh has been heterologously expressed and purified. SzTYR exhibits a molecular mass of 30 891.8 Da and shows a pH optimum of 9.0. Spectroscopic studies and kinetic investigations characterized SzTYR as a tyrosinase and proved its activity toward monophenols (coumaric acid), diphenols (caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid), and triphenols (gallic acid) naturally present in peatlands.

The herring from Green Bay averaged 0.86 [gamma] per g. of thiamin and from Saginaw Bay 0.87 [gamma] per g. Burbot averaged 3.78 [gamma] of thiamin per g. of fresh tissue. No thiamin was found in the carp, smelt and common suckers analyzed. Thiamin destruction by an enzyme found in some raw fish tissue has been reported. Herring frozen, then stored, lost an insignificant iimt. of thiamin in 11 months. Burbot appeared to increase in thiamin due to a decrease in moisture. Refrigeration at 4 [degree] C for 48, 120, and 137 hrs. resulted in some loss in 2 groups of herring. Baking resulted in an insignificant loss of thiamin in herring and there was 88-84% retention during frying. Lake herring may be considered a good source and burbot an excellent source of thiamin.																			0095-974X						1947	12	1					36	43											20286556					WOS:A1947UY17200006
J	Shuman, BN; Marsicek, J				Shuman, Bryan N.; Marsicek, Jeremiah			The structure of Holocene climate change in mid-latitude North America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A sequence of long-term and rapid changes during the Holocene appears in a network of 40 well resolved paleoclimate datasets from mid-latitude North America, including records of pollen-inferred temperatures, alkenone-derived sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), lake-level changes, dust accumulation, and lake isotopes from Idaho to Maine. Statistical analyses reveal that changes in insolation and the Laurentide Ice Sheet explain 51.7% of the variance in the records, especially multi-millennial trends, but peak rates of change indicate additional rapid changes at ca. 10.8, 9.4, 8.3, 7.0, 5.5-5.2, 4.7, 2.1, and 0.9 ka. Step changes between 9.4 and 8.3 ka relate to ice sheet dynamics that warmed much of the region, and changes at 5.5 ka were the largest since the demise of the ice sheet. The shift at 5.5 ka initiated widespread cooling and increases in effective moisture, which culminated in the coolest, wettest millennia in most areas after 2.1 ka. Replicated evidence from multiple records also shows a spatially-varied set of multi-century fluctuations including 1) low temperatures and high effective moisture at 5.5-4.8 ka in the mid-continent and 2) repeated phases of low SSTs, cool summers, and drought superimposed upon long cooling, moistening trends in eastern North American since 5.5 ka.

Wind forced circulation and sediment disturbance in a temperate lake	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Meteorological forcing on the surface of a lake can generate mixing and transport processes that alter water quality. This study examined how meteorological forcing affected water currents in Lake Rotoruaa large, shallow, temperate, polymictic lakeduring a period of sustained vertical mixing and strong winds. Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) measurements were recorded at two sites and a hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) was used to simulate water movement over the period of ADCP measurements. Model simulations show circulation patterns in Lake Rotorua are strongly influenced by the topography of the lake and, to a lesser extent, the catchment, with little variation in currents with depth during winter mixing. Northeasterly winds produced a clockwise circulation around the mid-lake island with a second anticlockwise gyre between the island and the western shore. This circulation pattern is consistent with topographic gyres found in other large lakes. A shift to a weaker southwesterly wind caused these circulation patterns to reverse direction over a period of c. 6h, with a weak secondary gyre also occurring within the main anticlockwise circulation. The effect of this circulation pattern on the resuspension of sediment and thus potential in-lake phosphorus control strategies is considered.

Results demonstrate that magnetic minerals in the lake sediment are dominated by stable single-domain (SSD) ferrimagnetic minerals derived mainly from in-washed catchment soil. Magnetic susceptibility increases sharply during the period AD 500-1050, and the grain size of magnetic minerals decreases. These changes are accompanied by increases in the concentrations of Fe, Ti, Zr and Si, and by decreased tree pollen percentages. delta O-18 measures in speleothems from South China demonstrate that climate was relatively uniform during this interval. Documentary evidence, however, indicates a large increase in the human population of Yunnan Province at that time. We conclude that the late Holocene sediment record from Xingyun Lake reflects a dramatic increase in soil erosion that was caused by a growing human population, which in turn was responsible for increased deforestation and agricultural activity. Our results from Xingyun Lake are consistent with sediment magnetic records from Erhai Lake, located near our study site. We therefore conclude that the interval AD 500-1050 corresponded to a regional-scale increase in the intensity of human activity on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.

Occurrence and toxicity of the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata in low-nutrient lakes in the northeastern United States	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												To date, most research on cyanobacterial blooms has focused on high-nutrient, not low-nutrient lakes. We investigated reports of the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata in lakes with low concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus across the northeastern United States by surveying selected oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes during four summers. G. echinulata is a large (1-3 mm diameter) colonial cyanobacterium that may have substantial effects on low-nutrient lakes used for drinking water and recreation because it can produce the toxin microcystin-LR. We found G. echinulata in the water column of 27 out of 37 lakes we sampled in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. G. echinulata densities were typically low (< 5 colonies L-1), but occasionally at surface scum-producing levels (up to 250 colonies L-1). G. echinulata colonies from the survey lakes exhibited detectable microcystin-LR concentrations ranging from 58 to 7,148 ng microcystin-LR g(-1) dry weight colonies. If G. echinulata densities increase to bloom levels observed in eutrophic systems, our data suggest that the microcystin-LR concentrations attributable to G. echinulata may reach levels known to influence aquatic organisms and pose human health risks.

However, the lack of sufficient modern pollen data in this region hinders an effective interpretation of fossil pollen records and quantitative vegetation/climate reconstructions. Here, 44 surface pollen samples from forest, steppe, and meadow were used to explore pollen-vegetation-climate relationships. Cluster analysis, species indicator analysis, and principal components analysis, were used to identify the discontinuous and continuous trends in pollen dataset. In addition, correlation analysis and boosted regression trees were used to investigate primary explanatory variables, while coinertia analysis and redundancy analysis to examine pollen-vegetation and pollen-climate correlations respectively. Our results show that: (1) vegetation can be well represented by surface pollen assemblages, i.e. forest is characterized by a high proportion of tree pollen (>70%) dominated by Betula (>40%) along with Alnus, Larix, and Pinus, whereas Steppe by herb pollen (>80%), dominated by Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae; (2) significant correlations exist between pollen assemblages and mean annual temperature and then mean annual precipitation; (3) pollen ratios of Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae and arboreal/non-arboreal can respectively be used as good indicators of humidity and temperature in Northeast China.

This 110-year-old lake, formed as a consequence of the mining of pyritic shales, is permanently meromictic. Two chemoclines separate an extremely acidic (pH similar to 2.6) mixolimnion from a metal-rich anoxic monimolimnion. The absence of spring mixolimnetic turnover due to ice melting and very slow heat propagation through the chemocline with a 6-month delay were observed. Extreme mixolimnetic oxygen maxima (up to 31 mg l(-1)) in phosphorus-rich lake (PO43- up to 1.6 mg l(-1)) well correlated with outbursts of phytoplankton. Phytoplankton consist of several acido-tolerant species of the genera Coccomyxa, Lepocinclis, Chlamydomonas and Chromulina. Surface phytoplankton biomass expressed as chlorophyll-a varies from 2 to 140 mu g l(-1). Multicellular zooplankton are almost absent with the exception of Cephalodella acidophila, a small rotifer occurring in low numbers. Large red larvae of the midge Chironomus gr. plumosus were found at the bottom close to the shore, with larvulae in the open water.

Hydrogeochemical and geophysical investigations to delineate underground water aquifer in arid regions: A case study, Gara oasis, Egypt	CONTRIBUTIONS TO GEOPHYSICS AND GEODESY												The goal of the present study is to investigate, delineate, and evaluate the shallow Miocene groundwater aquifer with vertical and lateral facies variations in the Gara oasis, western desert of Egypt. This oasis represents a typical arid region in North Africa. Through grid texture analysis, lineament detection, edge detection, thresholding, and identifying areas of structural complexity from the filtered residual reduced-to-pole magnetic anomaly map, it is possible to outline the fracture zones that principally con-trol the groundwater aquifers and water flow in the area. The groundwater quality and quantity are examined hydro-geochemically through nine groundwater samples that were gathered from wells and springs distributed throughout the area around Gara Lake. Mea-surements of physio-chemical parameters (TDS, pH, and EC) are carried out and its spatial distribution is critically studied. The results reveal that the ion-exchange process caused by water-rock interaction is the dominant process. Furthermore, the main ions in the groundwater in the study areas were Na and Cl. This might be due to evapo-ration or halite dissolution with the upward flow of waters through the fractures from the deep aquifer of the Nubian sandstone to the shallow aquifer of the fractured Miocene limestone.

The objective of this study was to determine the factors governing the spatial distribution of P. rubescens, including the major hydrodynamic processes and the influence of long-term reduction in nutrient concentrations during a period of climate warming. We used an intensive field campaign conducted from February 2010 to January 2011, to evaluate distributions of phytoplankton phyla, as well as P. rubescens, using spectrally resolved fluorescence measurements. These data provided highly spatially and temporally resolved phytoplankton population data suitable to calibrate and validate a coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic (ELCOM) and ecological model (CAEDYM) of the lake ecosystem. The simulations revealed the fundamental role of physiological features of P. rubescens that led to observed vertical patterns of distribution, notably a deep chlorophyll maximum, and a strong influence of lake hydrodynamic processes, particularly during high-discharge inflows in summer stratification. The simulations are used to examine growth-limiting factors that help to explain the increased prevalence of P. rubescens during re-oligotrophication.

The data set has a bimodal distribution with a prominent peak between -3 and -4 parts per thousand for both isotopes and a second much weaker peak at more depleted values of c. -9 to -7 parts per thousand. Taxa with 'heavy' values are interpreted to represent the inhabitants of the shores or shallow areas of the lake. Depleted values are attributed to species preferring freshwater habitats of springs or small rivulets, thus representing the freshwater end-member. The overall rather high values in both stable isotopes result from a combination of evaporation effects and the influx of already isotopically heavy freshwater from the karstic catchment area. Thus, the DLS is interpreted as a closed freshwater system without marine influence but with enough contribution of freshwater to keep the oxygen values close to -5 parts per thousand. Mean lake surface water temperatures, based on the delta O-18(shell) values, excluding the freshwater end-member taxa, range around roughly 19-21 degrees C. Despite the problems in calculating these temperatures, the values are in agreement with mean annual air temperatures deduced from the palaeobotanic record by applying the Coexistence Approach method. The seasonal range was around 10-11 degrees C and is mainly recorded in shells from lake settings. Taxa with freshwater end-member signatures lack this range due to the more stable temperature regime and less fluctuating dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool. Congeneric species from the same stratigraphic horizon often display discrete but different isotope signatures. This fact suggests habitat segregation and might be a major factor for sympatric speciation and the endemic radiation within the mollusc fauna of the DLS.					; Kern, Andrea K./V-5078-2017; Kern, Andrea/V-5078-2017	Mandic, Oleg/0000-0003-1955-7514; Kern, Andrea K./0000-0002-9343-0696; Harzhauser, Mathias/0000-0002-4471-6655													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2012	682	1					27	46		10.1007/s10750-011-0618-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0618-3													WOS:000299925600003

Little brown bat activity patterns and conservation implications in agricultural landscapes in boreal Yukon, Canada	ECOSPHERE												Agriculture can threaten the persistence of bat populations by removing forests and wetlands and by intensifying production. Both processes are underway in expanding agricultural landscapes of boreal North America. To inform land planning and agricultural practices aimed at maintaining a viable population of the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), we assessed the use by bats of human-modified (open fields, forest-field edges, and cleared edges of ponds) and unmodified (forest ponds and forest interior) habitat features in agricultural landscapes in southern Yukon, Canada (60 degrees N-61 degrees N), using acoustic recordings. We summarized bat activity (number of 3-s acoustic files with >= 1 pass/night) and bat feeding (files with > 1 feeding buzz/night) at grouped sets of habitat features (sites) and used generalized linear mixed models to test predictions about relative use of habitats. The active season for bats was late April to early October. Little brown bat feeding was strongly correlated with general activity, but feeding comprised a significantly higher proportion of all activity at forest ponds and forest interiors compared to field edges, open fields, and ponds in fields. Total bat activity was highest at forest ponds, followed by field edges, and substantially less in forest interiors and open fields. Forest ponds were used more than the edges of nearby ponds with some riparian clearing for fields. Bats increased use of forest interiors and decreased use of fields as duration of darkness decreased close to summer solstice. We recommend exclusion of ponds, lakes, and other wetlands from future agricultural land disposition, and retention of a riparian forested buffer of >= 40 m around current water bodies on farms. We also recommend retention of strips or patches of forest bordering fields and connected to riparian areas and to more extensive forests on public lands. A relatively young agricultural landscape can avoid some of the risks of intensive agriculture with proactive planning and stewardship.																			2150-8925					MAR	2023	14	3							e4446	10.1002/ecs2.4446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4446													WOS:000946169300001

The lacustrine successions of the lower Shahezi (K(1)sh) Formation at the depth from 4,542 to 5,695 m was systematically studied using environmental magnetism and cyclostratigraphy in this study. Magnetic analysis reveals an inverse correlation between magnetic susceptibility (MS) and lithological ranks in fine clastic sediments, with the highest values in mudstones and the lowest in sandstones. The main magnetism carriers in the lower K(1)sh are pseudo-single-domain (PSD) and/or multi-domain (MD) magnetite with minor presence of hematite. MS was used to further explore the genesis of the environmental and climatic variations through cyclostratigraphic analysis. Sedimentary cycles of 113 m, 34 m, 13 m and 6 m can be identified in the power spectrum, which were interpreted as long and short eccentricity, obliquity, and precession cycles, demonstrating the impact of astronomical cyclicity on sedimentary rhythmicity. Floating astronomical time scale (FATS) of 4,090 kyr and 4,148 kyr were established by tuning the inferred long and short eccentricity cycles to the artificial 405-kyr and 105-kyr orbital eccentricity curves respectively. The estimated sediment accumulation rate around 28 cm/kyr confirms the rapid deposition process within the faulted lacustrine basin. Based on this study, the lake level oscillations in Songliao Basin are assumed to be shaped by long and short eccentricity, precession and semi-precession cycles during Early Cretaceous. This study also indicates that the sand-mudstone alternations deposition in K(1)sh is most likely driven by the seasonal discrepancies of summer insolation during semi-precession periods.

Nutrient and algal responses to winterkilled fish-derived nutrient subsidies in eutrophic lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Schoenebeck CW, Brown ML, Chipps SR, German DR. 2012. Nutrient and algal responses to winterkilled fish-derived nutrient subsidies in eutrophic lakes. Lake Reserv Manage. 28:189-199. Fishes inhabiting shallow, glacial lakes of the Prairie Pothole Region in the United States and Canada periodically experience hypoxia in severe winters that can lead to extensive fish mortality resulting in high biomasses of dead fish. However, the role of carcass-derived nutrient subsidies in shallow, eutrophic lakes translocated to pelagic primary producers is not well documented. This study quantified the influence of winterkill events on nutrient contributions from decaying fish carcasses of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and the phytoplankton response among pre- and postwinterkill years and compared seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation and phytoplankton community composition between winterkill and nonwinterkill lakes. We found that fish carcasses contributed an estimated 2.5-4.3 kg/ha of total (Kjeldahl) nitrogen (N) and 0.3-0.5 kg/ha of total phosphorus (P) to lakes that experienced winterkill conditions. Nutrient bioassays showed that winterkill lakes were primarily N limited, congruent with the low N: P ratios produced by fish carcasses corrected for the disproportionate release of N and P (8.6). Nutrient subsidies translocated from decomposed fish to pelagic primary producers seemed to have little immediate influence on the seasonal phytoplankton community composition, but total N and subsequent chlorophyll-a increased the year following the winterkill event. Cyanobacteria density varied seasonally but was higher in winterkill lakes, presumably due to the integration of nutrients released from fish decomposition. This study provides evidence that large inputs of autochthonous fish-derived nutrients contribute to nutrient availability within winterkilled systems and increase the maximum attainable biomass of the phytoplankton community.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2012	28	3					189	199		10.1080/07438141.2012.693574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2012.693574													WOS:000308981900002
J	Chumchal, MM; Drenner, RW				Chumchal, MM; Drenner, RW			Interrelationships between phosphorus loading and common carp in the regulation of phytoplankton biomass	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The interrelationship between phosphorus loading and common carp in the regulation of phytoplankton biomass was examined in a four-week summer mesocosm experiment. The factorial design consisted of two levels of phosphorus loading (with/ without) cross-classified with two levels of common carp (with/without). At the conclusion of the mesocosm experiment, common carp were removed from mesocosms and a nutrient excretion and defecation trial was performed. A significant interaction effect was detected between phosphorus loading and common carp for chlorophyll-a (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass), total nitrogen, and nitrogen: phosphorus. Common carp had modest effects on chlorophyll-a in mesocosms without phosphorus loading but relatively large enhancement effects on chlorophyll-a in mesocosms with phosphorus loading. Common carp increased total nitrogen in mesocosms with, phosphorus loading but had no effect on total nitrogen in mesocosms without phosphorus loading. The synergistic effect of phosphorus loading and common carp on chlorophyll-a was due to nitrogen excretion and defecation by common carp and the subsequent enhancement of nitrogen in mesocosms with phosphorus loading.

Primary production and extracellular release was determined by C-14 method, respiration (dark oxygen consumption) - by Winkler's method. Collected results allow to conclude that: (i) in all studied lakes primary production was primarily cyanobacterial, although in mesotrophic ones participation of eukaryotic phytoplankton in light CO, fixation was more pronounced; (ii) in,mesotrophic part of GMLS primary production was limited alternately by N and P availability and less dependent on N and P regeneration processes, whereas in southern, eutrophic lakes it was primarily fueled by regeneration of biogenic substances from organic compounds and strongly limited by N resources; (iii) although in photic zone of whole GMLS respiration was dominated by heterotrophic bacteria, in its mesotrophic part also participation of other plankton components in respiration processes was significant and, (iv) that in eutrophic lakes planktonic respiration was more dependent on low molecular weight products liberated enzymatically from organic substrates than on organic compounds released by primary producers. The mean production to respiration ratio, which varied from 2.11 to 2.60 in northern, and from 2.05 to 3.67 in southern lakes suggested that during period of investigations photic zones of lakes of both parts of GMLS were net autotrophic systems.

Evidence for bluegill spawning plasticity obtained by disentangling complex factors related to recruitment	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fishes can exhibit many forms of plasticity to maximize fitness. However, limited information exists on the ability of freshwater fish to adjust spawning behavior and characteristics (e.g., timing, duration, magnitude of spawning events) to minimize mortality of recruits and ultimately maximize fitness. We wanted to test the life history hypothesis for bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) (i.e., opportunistic strategy) utilizing existing literature and results from our study to further evaluate the potential for spawning plasticity in this species. Our objective was to identify bluegill recruitment bottlenecks (i.e., periods of high mortality) and factors associated with these events in a single lake during 7 consecutive years. Bluegills exhibited shorter spawning durations and fewer spawning pulses (i.e., peaks in larval production) compared with bluegill in previous studies. Late-hatched (compared with early-hatched) bluegills consistently contributed the most to the fall juvenile population; these recruitment patterns were primarily attributed to biotic drivers. Our study suggests that bluegill could exhibit spawning plasticity and extends our current understanding of adaptations that are potentially capable of increasing fitness for a freshwater fish species under a wide range of environmental conditions and uncertainty.

Sodium chloride was added to the microcosms to cause osmotic stress and the survival of the bacteria was measured by viable count and ability to respire, The survival of A. hydrophila was dependent upon the concentration of sodium chloride added to the microcosm, with higher concentrations causing a more rapid decline in the viable count. The ability of cells to respire was also gradually lost, but in the microcosms containing 5% and 7% (w/v) sodium chloride, the viable count had fallen below the limits of detection when respiration measurements indicated that 30% of the cells were capable of respiration. Alkaline phosphatase activity increased in the flasks amended with sodium chloride and the osmoprotectant betaine, in both cells with a derepressed alkaline phosphatase and with a repressed alkaline phosphatase. No comparable increase was seen in cells grown with either betaine or sodium chloride alone.

However, these isotope hydrology techniques rely on distinct spatial or temporal patterns of delta H-2 and delta O-18 within the hydrologic cycle. In New Zealand, lack of understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of delta H-2 and delta O-18 of river water hinders development of regional and national-scale hydrological models. We measured delta H-2 and delta O-18 monthly, together with river flow rates at 58 locations across New Zealand over a two-year period. Results show: (a) general patterns of decreasing delta H-2 and delta O-18 with increasing latitude were altered by New Zealand's major mountain ranges; delta H-2 and delta O-18 were distinctly lower in rivers fed from higher elevation catchments, and in eastern rain-shadow areas of both islands; (b) river water delta H-2 and delta O-18 values were partly controlled by local catchment characteristics (catchment slope, PET, catchment elevation, and upstream lake area) that influence evaporation processes; (c) regional differences in evaporation caused the slope of the river water line (i.e., the relationship between delta H-2 and delta O-18 in river water) for the (warmer) North Island to be lower than that of the (cooler, mountain-dominated) South Island; (d) delta H-2 seasonal offsets (i.e., the difference between seasonal peak and mean values) for individual sites ranged from 0.50 parts per thousand to 5.07 parts per thousand. Peak values of delta O-18 and delta H-2 were in late summer, but values peaked 1 month later at the South Island sites, likely due to greater snow-melt contributions to streamflow. Strong spatial differences in river water delta H-2 and delta O-18 caused by orographic rainfall effects and evaporation may inform studies of water mixing across landscapes. Generally distinct seasonal isotope cycles, despite the large catchment sizes of rivers studied, are encouraging for transit time analysis applications.

Entrainment of Rainbow Smelt through Oahe Dam during the 2011 Missouri River Flood	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Entrainment of fishes through impoundments is common, and Rainbow Smelt Osmerus mordax, which is the dominant forage fish species in the Missouri River reservoir, Lake Oahe, is frequently entrained through Oahe Dam at low rates. In 2011, the Missouri River endured a flood of a magnitude never before experienced in recorded history. Concerns regarding Rainbow Smelt entrainment were numerous; thus we sought to determine Rainbow Smelt entrainment rates. To evaluate entrainment, we used stationary trawls downstream from each Oahe Dam outlet structure and repeated hydroacoustic sampling above Oahe Dam on Lake Oahe. Trawl sampling estimated that 231 million adult and 433 million age-0 Rainbow Smelt were entrained during the summer of 2011. Hydroacoustic sampling estimated a loss of 213 million adult and 520 million age-0 Rainbow Smelt from Lake Oahe. Thus, both gears provided an estimate of Rainbow Smelt loss that was surprisingly similar. Additionally, Rainbow Smelt entrainment rates were substantially higher from 1500 to 2100 hours. This corresponds to the time of day when Rainbow Smelt exhibit a diel migration into the water column likely making them more susceptible to entrainment as they pass by Oahe Dam intake structures. By reducing discharge during this critical time period, entrainment of Rainbow Smelt could be dramatically reduced.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2016	36	4					844	851		10.1080/02755947.2016.1173139	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2016.1173139													WOS:000381683600013

Here we combined groundwater stable isotopes (H-2 and O-18), age dating (H-3 and C-14) and water vapour transport trajectories modeling to reveal the moisture source and climate evolution over the last 30 kyr in southeastern Qaidam Basin, northeast Tibetan Plateau. The compositions of delta D and delta O-18 indicated that the groundwater was mainly recharged by precipitation and snowmelt water from the East Kunlun Mountains in the south. The groundwater stable isotopes exhibited a depleted trend from west to east across the four catchments of the basin which seemed not to alter since the late stage of the Late Pleistocene. A combination of the deuterium excess (d-excess) of groundwater and present-day moisture source modeling revealed that the moisture source had been dominated by the Westerlies without obvious impact of the summer monsoon since the last 30 kyr. The enriched delta D and delta O-18 of groundwater during the Holocene suggested a warmer climate than the late stage of the Late Pleistocene, which seemed not to be accompanied by moisture source variations. The results of this study could be helpful for both climate change and water resource research in this region or even, over the entire Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A relative calibration of a set of instruments can be provided using this IOP closure equation. Measurement of the true beam attenuation coefficient c is not practical as all attenuation instrumentation has some finite acceptance angle in which scattered light is collected. We provide a theoretical framework for measuring the attenuation and scattering coefficients in a consistent manner. Using this framework, we provide a practical version of the IOP closure equation. We apply the practical IOP closure equation to measurements made at Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, in the spring of 1992. Results of this IOP closure indicate that the practical closure equation is a useful approach. Closure was achieved during some measurement sets but not at others. The intermittent lack of closure may be due to the method of determining the scattering coefficient from the general angle scattering meter or that the calibration of at least one of the instruments drifted during the time of the experiment.					; Voss, Kenneth/JAN-7204-2023	Voss, Kenneth/0000-0002-7860-5080; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				JUL 15	1995	100	C7					13193	13199		10.1029/95JC00457	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JC00457													WOS:A1995RJ35600007

The mean Hg concentration in muscle tissue of a 1 kg pike ranged from 0.15 to 1.36-mu-g g-1 (ww) in the lakes. There was a trend towards higher concentrations in acidic and humic lakes than in circumneutral and clear-water lakes. The Hg content of pike from successive lakes of a lake chain was similar, whereas there were clear differences in the Hg concentrations among seepage lakes and the uppermost lakes of other lake chains. The latter was probably due to special characteristics of the lakes: in one lake pike was the only fish species, two of the lakes were regulated by beaver, and one lake was a groundwater or spring lake. Our observations indicate that Hg concentrations in pike can vary considerably from lake to lake in a small geographical area and that the variation among lakes in the accumulation of Hg in fish largely depends on lake characteristics and on the diet of pike.																			0049-6979					APR	1991	56						369	378		10.1007/BF00342284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00342284													WOS:A1991GM38200029

This technique separates bacteria on the basis of the buoyant mass of the cells and fractions can be collected for determination of cell numbers and volume. This enables the cell density and size distribution of the sample to be calculated. SdFFF is also capable of generating very detailed cell size and specific gravity distributions which may be useful data in assessing the bacterial growth status of natural waters. Data for samples from seawater, two lakes and a sewer drain are given. The specific gravity of cells varies both within and between samples and falls in the range 1.03-1.2 g cm(-3). This contrasts with previous work which shows little variation within a given cultured bacteria sample and indicates that natural populations contain a range of different bacteria types.

This study addresses the use of satellite data and ground observations for the assessment of Rawal Lake water clarity in Pakistan. Satellite data from Landsat sensor for the years 2009-2013 are used to model Secchi Disc Transparency (SDT). Landsat images within +/- 3 days of the measured SDT data is used for the development of a regression model. The results of this study show that ETM+ band3 and band1/band3 ratio is the reliable predictor of SDT with R-2 values of 0.725 and 0.793 respectively. The modeled SDT is further used to estimate the Trophic State Index (TSI) and trophic condition of Rawal Lake. In addition, the in situ Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Phosphorus (TP) concentration are used to calculate the TSI of the Lake. The Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical test shows that the increasing trend in TSI based on SDT is significant (tau = 0.523). The trophic condition of Rawal Lake indicates that the Lake falls under the hypereutrophic category, that is, highly polluted and extremely unhealthy for the purpose of drinking. (C) 2015 COSPAR.

(RANUNCULACEAE) - RARE AND ENDANGERED SPECIES IN EUROPEAN FLORA	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Pulsatilla patens has a circumpolar distribution from Eurasia to North America. This species occurs in the central and central-eastern parts of Europe, where is a rare and threatened species. In Poland, the largest number of sites is found in the north-east. A study on populations of P patens was carried out in 2009-2010, at two wildlife refuges of the NATURA 2000 (N2000) network situated in North-Eastern Poland. Local names are following: the "Sejnenskie Lake District" (SLD) and the "Grasslands in the Military Training Grounds in Orzysz" (GMO). The current population structure of P. patens was estimated including the number, density and structure of different life cycle stages. Seventy-nine research plots of 2 m x 2 m were established at sites: dry heath, xeric sand calcareous grassland and pine forest. In each plot, all individuals were recorded and classified into life cycle stages: juvenile, vegetative and flowering individuals. The studies were carried out twice a year - in spring, during the full bloom of Easter pasque flower and in summer, in time of its fructification. The bioindication method was applied in order to determine the climatic and soil conditions of the habitats. Relationships were estimated between these population characteristics and habitat-related features such as the cover of phanerogams, cryptogams, litter, and bare soil. The population found on the GMO, was composed of 316 individuals which gives the density 6.4 ind. per plot while the one in SLD consisted of 202 individuals which gives the density 6.7 ind. per plot. The age structure of the populations proved that these were stable populations. This was evidenced by a large share of vegetative individuals - in both populations they prevailed (ca 64%). The highest share of juvenile individuals was noticed at the sites characterized by a moderate cover of cryptogams (21-35%). The analysis of correlations showed that on the non-forest habitats - dry heath and xeric sand calcareous grassland, the total number of individuals and number of vegetative individuals were negatively correlated with the cover of phanerogams and the cover of cryptogams. It was recorded negative impact of dense moss layer on the number of juvenile individuals. Moreover, the cover of litter had negative influence on the total number of individuals, number of juvenile and vegetative individuals. In contrast, the total number of individuals and number of juvenile individuals at that sites was positively affected by the cover of bare soil. A positive correlation was found between the number of vegetative individuals and phanerogams, and also between the number of juvenile individuals and the cover of bare soil at forest habitats. Negative impact on total number of individuals and the number of flowering individuals is exerted by the cover of cryptogams. Considering the ecological indicators set for the plant communities in which Pulsatilla patens appeared, it should be concluded that these were the habitats characterized by moderate light and moderately warm climate condition. The communities with Pulsatilla patens grew on dry and fresh soils, oligotrophic and mesotrophic ones, composed of sand and argillaceous clay. The pH ranging was from moderately acidic to neutral. The analysis of the age structure of the examined populations, the latter can be said to be stable. It can therefore be assumed that the Eastern pasque flower has met the favorable habitat conditions at the analyzed sites, therefore it is justifiable to claim that these sites will exist in the future and will constitute an important part of the resources of this species in Poland.

Dynamics of an increasing lake trout population in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To quantify movement and abundance of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, large trap nets were fished during two periods (30 September 2003-31 March 2004 and 10 September-15 December 2005) and gill nets were fished from 12 February to 6 April 2006. Trap-net catch rates and recapture rates of previously marked lake trout suggested that sampling locations along the eastern shore were associated with either lake trout foraging or spawning aggregations in both years. Abundance of mostly mature lake trout that were vulnerable to trap-netting in autumn increased from 6,000 in 2003 to 11,000 in 2005, whereas total abundance of immature and mature lake trout increased from 12,000 in 2003 (based on trap-net size selectivity) to 36,000 in 2005 (based on gill-net recaptures). The increase in abundance of all immature and mature take trout estimated by mark-recapture in 1999, 2003, and 2005 was well described by an exponential growth model (intrinsic rate of population change r = 0.490; annual rate of population change lambda = 1.631), which indicated that the population would double every 1.4 years and would reach nearly 400,000 fish by 20 10 if carrying capacity was not reached sooner. Based on population densities observed elsewhere within the species' range, an abundance of 400,000 lake trout is possible, but population density at carrying capacity is probably lower in very deep lakes like Lake Pend Oreille, where much of the area is too deep for lake trout. During 2006, suppression of the lake trout population through gillnetting, trap-netting, and angling was reflected by an exploitation rate of 44% (30-63%) and a total annual mortality rate of 58% (39-82%), well above the sustainable threshold mortality rate of 50%. We recommend the use of population modeling to evaluate the success of ongoing lake trout suppression efforts in Lake Pend Oreille.

Government agencies surrounding Lake Ontario are currently undertaking a variety of studies to assess the feasibility of reintroducing Atlantic salmon. We released hatchery-reared adult Atlantic salmon into a Lake Ontario tributary to examine spawning interactions between this species and fall-spawning exotic salmonids found in the same stream. Chinook salmon, coho salmon and brown trout were observed interacting with spawning Atlantic salmon in nearly one-quarter of our observation bouts, with chinook salmon interacting most frequently. Whereas a previous investigation found that chinook salmon caused elevated agonistic behaviour and general activity by spawning Atlantic salmon, the present study found that interspecific courtship was the most common form of exotic interaction with spawning Atlantic salmon. In particular, we observed precocial male Chinook salmon courting female Atlantic salmon and defending the female against approach by male Atlantic salmon. We discuss the potential implications of these interactions on the Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon reintroduction programme.

ACTIVE NITRIFICATION IN EARLY SUMMER	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In the hypolimnion of Lake Kizaki, a significant increase in the concentration of nitrate and a decrease in ammonium were observed from late June to early July in 1977 and 1979. These remarkable changes in the hypolimnetic nitrate and ammonium were due to nitrification in the water column. The maximum daily increase in the nitrate concentration found was 1.5 .mu.g .cntdot. atom.cntdot.l-1.cntdot.day-1 at 20 m depth. And this value corresponded to .apprx. 7% of the total inorganic nitrogen observed at this depth. The rates of ammonium and nitrite oxidation were measured using the nitrogen-15 technique. The potential rates of ammonium and nitrite oxidation during late June and early July increased simultaneously about 2 orders of magnitude over either values at a time when active nitrification had not occurred. There were no appreciable changes in the counts of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria corresponding to remarkable changes in the hypolimnetic nitrate and ammonium.																			0003-9136						1982	93	3					272	286																WOS:A1982NE69300002

Variability of microplastic loading and retention in four inland lakes in Minnesota, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Microplastic pollution (plastic particles < 5 mm) has potentially harmful impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Un-derstanding the factors that impact microplastic loading and distribution within aquatic ecosystems is crucial for assessing potential threats from microplastics. Here we examine the extent of microplastic pollution in the surface waters and sediments of four small inland lakes in Minnesota, USA that represent a range of human impacts as well as a variety of watershed and lake characteristics. Surface water particulates and benthic sedi-ments were collected in the summers of 2019 and 2020 to examine the loading of microplastics into these lakes and their distribution throughout the ecosystems. Lower size cut offs were set at 330 mu m for surface water particulate samples and 250 mu m for sediment samples. Watershed to surface area ratio (WS:SA) and urban development were the most influential factors on microplastic loading. Surface water microplastic concentrations ranged from 27,000 microplastics km-2 in Elk Lake (small WS:SA and minimally developed) to 152,000 microplastics km-2 in White Iron Lake (large WS:SA and low development). Concentrations in benthic sediments ranged from 30 microplastics kg- 1 dry sediment in White Iron Lake (forested watershed) to 270 microplastics kg -1 dry sediment in Peltier Lake (urbanized watershed) and were not directly correlated to surface water concentrations. Results from this study highlight the characteristics of small lakes that influence spatial and temporal variability in microplastic loading, retention, and deposition of microplastics to sediments. Further, this study demonstrates the difficulties of accurately predicting microplastic loading and the importance of comprehensive sampling to account for the variability of microplastic loading and distribution in smaller inland lakes.

Carassius carassius, Perca fluviatilis, Gymnocephalus cernua). The sample of parasites in commercial fish, however, did not reach the number of parasitic species reported in earlier studies. During the investigation several episodes of mass fish death occurred due to oxygen depletion in the lake. The most severe ones were recorded in January 1984 and the winter period of 1984-85 when nearly all of the fish died. The infectious and parasitic diseases are described in detail. To control infections in carp several short-term bath procedures were tested and control measures were suggested to prevent death of fish due to oxygen deficiency.																			0001-7213	1801-7576				MAR	1989	58	1					53	90		10.2754/avb198958010053	http://dx.doi.org/10.2754/avb198958010053													WOS:A1989CU61800004

An investigation of periodic hypoxia at Ardbear Salt Lake	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												The factors potentially leading to the development of periodic hypoxia were investigated based on field studies performed over a series of two years between November, 1997 and November, 1999. This was attempted by investigating both hard and soft seafloor. Descriptive and predictive models were developed that incorporated physical, chemical and biological data derived from the present study and previous work and were used to anticipate future possible crashes of the faunal communities due to hypoxia/anoxia. It was concluded that periodic hypoxia at Ardbear is a natural event caused by several factors to varying degrees. The results of the present study indicate that the major controlling factors for oxygen depletion are the shallow depth of the system, coupled with the development of thermal stratification during periods of calm ambient meteorological conditions of the warmer summer months. In addition, a soft, muddy bottom and highly productive plankton blooms exacerbate conditions in a system already predisposed to hypoxia.																			0025-3154					NOV	2008	88	7			SI		1297	1307		10.1017/S0025315408001914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315408001914													WOS:000261160000001

Existing studies of environmental proxies and climate model simulations are contradictory, with interpretations varying between cold-dry and cold-wet environmental conditions which differentially influenced lake volumes, loess deposition and vegetation communities across the TP. Genetic and archaeological studies suggest anatomically modern paleolithic foragers initially occupied the TP between 60 and 30 ka, and may have seasonally occupied the TP during the LGM. Hence, a better understanding for LGM environmental conditions is needed in order to estimate whether paleolithic foragers could have survived on the TP during the extreme LGM cold stage. Here we report the investigation of lacustrine sediments and beach deposits within two paleoshorelines around Dagze Co on the southern TP, similar to 22 and similar to 42 m higher than the present lake level. Optical age estimates suggest the sediments were deposited during the LGM and mid-Holocene, respectively. TraCE-21 climate model simulation results suggest that net annual LGM precipitation in the Dagze Co basin was lower than the mid-Holocene, but about the same as that of the past 1,000 years. Combining the optical age estimates with TraCE-21 and CAM4 climate model simulation results, we deduce that increased summer precipitation and glacier meltwater supply, combined with decreased lake surface evaporation, produced LGM lake levels similar to 22 m higher than present. We also synthesized paleoenvironmental records reported across the TP spanning the LGM. This synthesis suggests that the LGM climate in the northern TP was cold and dry, but that some of the southern TP was cold and wet. These relatively wetter LGM conditions in the southern TP may have favored the growth of cold-resistant plants which, in turn, may have supported larger herbivore populations, and provided food for paleolithic foragers. We conclude that seasonal or short-term human occupation of the TP during the LGM was thus more likely in the southern TP than in the north.

J	Pawluszek, K; Borkowski, A				Pawluszek, Kamila; Borkowski, Andrzej			Impact of DEM-derived factors and analytical hierarchy process on landslide susceptibility mapping in the region of Roznow Lake, Poland	NATURAL HAZARDS												Choosing appropriate landslide-controlling factors (LCFs) in landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a challenging task and depends on the nature of terrain and expert knowledge and experience. Nowadays, it is very common to use digital elevation model (DEM) and DEM-derivatives, as a representation of the topographic conditions. The objective of this study is to explore topography in depth and simultaneously reduce redundant information within DEM-derivatives using principal component analysis. Moreover, this study investigates the impact of DEM-derived factors on LSM. Therefore, three various strategies were tested. The first strategy included a set of LCFs created from the four initial principal components, which were provided from DEM-derived factors. The second strategy included a set of parameters which contained additional lithological and environmental factors. The third strategy utilises the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to assign weights to each LCF. The LSM was performed based on landslide susceptibility index. Obtained results show that 60% of existing landslides fell into high and very high susceptibility zones using first and second strategies. It proves that topographic factors play a significant role in LSM. Adding additional lithological and environmental factors to the set of LCFs did not improve the results significantly, unless the AHP was used in the third strategy. It improved results significantly; up to 70%. Results from second and third strategies highlight utility of AHP in LSM. Presented studies were performed on the area very prone to landslide occurrence in the region of RoA 1/4 nw Lake, Poland.

It is commonplace to assume that smaller phytoplankton have an advantage in growth related traits while larger ones are more resistant to losses. However, the current state of literature calls for a more differentiated view. It is still controversial, whether smaller phytoplankton have higher maximal growth rates (A mu(max)) or if there is a peak of A mu(max) at intermediate size (10(2) A mu m(3) cell volume). Smaller phytoplankton have an advantage in nutrient acquisition at low concentrations while larger phytoplankton have an advantage in utilizing nutrient pulses and exploiting vertical gradients. At equal density, larger phytoplankton experience bigger sinking losses. Small phytoplankton (< 5-10 A mu m) are more affected mostly from grazing by protists and tunicates, while larger phytoplankton are more affected by copepod and krill grazing. Size spectra within the most important higher taxa show some conspicuous differences between marine and lake phytoplankton, e.g. the absence of very large diatoms (> 10(5) A mu m(3)) in lake phytoplankton and the absence of large (> 10(3) A mu m(3)) green algae in marine plankton. Overall, size is one of the most important traits for the performance of phytoplankton, but it is overly simplistic to equate small size with metabolic advantages.					; Genitsaris, Savvas/L-5302-2019; Charalampous, Evangelia/ACA-4940-2022	Moustaka-Gouni, Maria/0000-0002-0845-1928; Charalampous, Evangelia/0000-0002-7724-4658; Genitsaris, Savvas/0000-0003-0585-2571; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					494	508		10.1093/plankt/fbw071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbw071													WOS:000402613800011

Here we present a record of climate change in East Africa between 175 and 60 ka. This time span includes the last interglacial (the Eemian, 130-117 ka), which may provide the closest analogue to the present interglacial, Assessments of the nature and timing of East African climate changes are based on lake-level fluctuations of Lake Naivasha (Kenya) inferred from sediment characteristics, diatom assemblages, and 40Ar/39Ar dating, Our results show dramatic alternation between deep, freshwater and shallow, highly alkaline lake conditions. The Lake Naivasha record demonstrates that periods of increased humidity in East Africa mainly follow precessional insolation forcing in spring, causing more intense April-May rains every 23 k.y.

J	Liu, JL; Cheng, LJ; Yao, SC; Xue, B				Liu, Jinliang; Cheng, Longjuan; Yao, Shuchun; Xue, Bin			Variations in stable carbon isotopes in different components of aquatic macrophytes from Taihu Lake, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Understanding the fractionation mechanism and factors controlling carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in macrophytes is significant for studying the biogeochemical carbon cycle and changes in nutrients within lakes. However, whether the environmental implications of delta C-13 are different in the different components (alpha-cellulose, holocellulose and whole sample) of macrophytes is unclear. In this paper, the delta(13)Ccomposition of different macrophytes tissue components in Taihu Lake was analysed on spatial and temporal scales. The effects of aquatic environmental variables on the delta C-13 values of macrophytes were also explored. The results showed that emergent plants have the most negative stable carbon isotope signals, with a mean value (+/- SD) of -27.85 parts per thousand +/- 0.95 parts per thousand. Submerged macrophytes have large variations with significantly more positive delta C-13 values (-15.19 parts per thousand +/- 3.08 parts per thousand). The delta C-13 values of floating-leaved plants (-25.32 parts per thousand +/- 1.02 parts per thousand) fall between those of the two groups above. In the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the different components (alpha-cellulose, holocellulose and whole sample) of delta C-13 exhibited significant differences (p-value < 0.01) among the three groups of macrophytes. However, there was no significant seasonal difference in the delta C-13 of macrophytes. In addition, the delta C-13 of macrophytes in rivers were lighter than those in lakes. Correlation analyses indicated that the water pH was the main factor affecting delta C-13 variability in macrophytes. The delta C-13 values of alpha-cellulose showed stronger sensitivity to environmental variation than did those of the whole samples and holocellulose. Hence, it is necessary to extract alpha-cellulose when using the delta C-13 of aquatic macrophytes to study the changes in lake ecological environments. These results provided a theoretical reference and experimental data support for a modern process of using delta C-13 in macrophytes for palaeoenvironmental changes.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2020	118								106721	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106721													WOS:000578967500018

The sizes of the blocks - the largest of which is more than 2 m in nominal diameter - and differences in rock types allow the definition of at least 6 dispersal lobes of mostly undetermined relative age. The orientations of the lobes help approximate the locations of vents or explosion sources on the floor of the caldera, now deeply buried by younger lava flows. The vents may have been distributed northward for about 2 km from near the site of the modern Halema'uma'u Crater and were apparently confined to the western half of the caldera. The blocks are entirely lithic except for those in one dispersal lobe, which contains cored bombs and blocks as well as juvenile lapilli. Eruption parameters calculated from EJECT! suggest that the phreatic and phreatomagmatic explosions could have been generated at the water table, about 600 m below the high point on the caldera rim.

All 3 spp. fed primarily on amphipods, but they also ate chironomids and trichopterans regularly. Rock bass ate more techopterans than chironomids; white perch and yellow perch ate more chironomids. Snails and crayfish were significant items in the diet of rock bass but occurred infrequently in stomachs of white perch and yellow perch. White perch and yellow perch frequently ate fish eggs during early summer, but rock bass seldom ate fish eggs. Fish were important in the diets of white perch > 300 mm and rock bass and yellow perch > 200 mm. Similarities in the diets of fish 1 yr old or older suggest that the potential for competition between white perch and yellow perch is greater than that between rock bass and either white perch or yellow perch.																			0028-7210						1981	28	2					191	201																WOS:A1981MP79600006

The b-CDs were obtained via one-step hydrothermal synthesis by utilizing laurel fallen leaves. And the as-synthesized b-CDs were applied for sensing Fe3+ based on fluorescence (FL) quenching effect both in water and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with a wide linear range from 1 mu M to 300 mu M, the detection limits (LODs) respectively to be 0.34 mu M in water and 0.48 mu M in PBS solution. The FL intensity of b-CDs was quenched fleetly within 1 min after adding Fe3+. The sensing mechanism of the b-CDs + Fe(3+)system can be attributed to the internal filtration effect (IFE) mechanism and the electron transfer (ET) between b-CDs and Fe3+ in water, and only the IFE mechanism in PBS solution based on multiple experimental evidences. Moreover, the as-proposed probe was successfully adopted for monitoring Fe3+ in lake water and tap water samples. This research shows some merits of economic, simplicity, green, high selectivity, and quick response for Fe3+ determination, and provides an approach for the water quality monitoring of Fe3+ and the effective utilization of waste biological materials.

Individuals were found throughout the lake during summer snagged on sportfishing lines. The population included parthenogenetic (92%) and sexual (2%) females and males (6%). Cercopagis has a very long caudal appendage that is more than five times the body length and terminates in a distinctive loop. Females and males from Lake Ontario were significantly smaller than individuals from the Neva Estuary, Baltic Sea. In Eurasia, C. pengoi occurs in relatively warm fresh and brackish waters (0-14 parts per thousand) at population densities usually <3000 individualsm.m(-3); mean and maximum population densities in Lake Ontario were 170 and 322 individuals.m(-3), respectively. The presence of females with resting eggs indicates that Cercapagis will likely establish in Lake Ontario. As with other recently introduced invertebrates, Cercopagis likely was transported to the Great Lakes in ballast water from eastern Europe. The rapid influx of Ponto-Caspian species into the Great Lakes warrants further study including identification of source populations, mechanisms of dispersal, impacts on recipient ecosystems, and efficacy of ballast water exchange programs.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Panov, Vadim/E-3927-2016; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Panov, Vadim/0009-0003-0738-0800; Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865; 													0706-652X					JAN	1999	56	1					1	5		10.1139/cjfas-56-1-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-1-1													WOS:000078991300001

Samples of total particulates, non-algal particles and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were first prepared by quantitative filter technique (QFT) and then absorption coefficients of these color producing agents were determined by spectrophotometry. Spectral characteristics of absorption coefficients by total particulate matter, spectral specific absorption dependency on chlorophyll concentration (Chl-a) of phytoplankton, spectral absorption slopes variation for CDOM and non-algal particles and their corresponding reasons were examined and clarified over five months of 2009 and 2010 in this study. Results suggest that total particulate spectral absorption in Chagan Lake is mainly dominated by non-algal particles in most cases, but phytoplankton could be the dominant contributor when chlorophyll concentration is high (up to 84.48 mg/m(3) in autumn 2010). The specific absorption coefficients of phytoplankton particulate (a*(ph)(lambda)) dependency on Chl-a is significantly variable due to relative contributions of package effect and accessory pigments, and the parameters of power function are clearly biased on a long time span. The sources of variability in spectral absorption slopes of CDOM and non-algal particles are mainly attributed to the changing proportions of high molecular weight humic acids and mineral suspended sediments in waters, respectively.

The gamma-emitting nuclides library has been designed to assess the activity concentration for radionuclides belonging to the natural series of uranium and thorium (208Tl, 212Bi, 212Pb, 214Bi, 214Pb, 226Ra, 228Ac, 234Th, 235U), and 40K gamma-line. The measured overall average value of the radionuclides' activity concentration was 15 Bq/kg, while for 40K was 286 Bq/kg. The true coincidence summing was corrected using the Genie-2000 software, and LabSOCS was used to calculate the total efficiencies.

Surface PAR values remained unchanged between 1998 and 2010, but there was an 18-22% drop in K-dPAR during the March/April isothermal period as water clarity increased. This transparency increase was accompanied by a 41-53% decline in Chl a concentration (pg . L-1) and a 42-46% decline in modeled primary production (Great Lakes Primary Production Model). These changes were most pronounced in 2001-2003 which coincided with the period of initial colonization of the quagga mussels. Statistically significant spatial differences were noted in Chl a (mu g . L-1) concentrations between mid-depth (z = 30-90 m deep), and offshore (z > 90 m deep) waters. Chi a concentrations in the mid-depth region (30-90 m) decreased at a higher rate compared to offshore waters (>90 m) likely as a result of filtration activities of quagga mussel.

J	TRAUTMANN, NM; MCCULLOCH, CE; OGLESBY, RT				TRAUTMANN, NM; MCCULLOCH, CE; OGLESBY, RT			STATISTICAL DETERMINATION OF DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSESSMENT OF LAKE RESTORATION PROGRAMS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												To test the effectiveness of lake restoration programs, monitoring must be carried out both before and after any change is made. Statistical techniques are presented for calculation of these sampling requirements both for individual lakes and for groups of lakes analyzed collectively. Illustration of these techniques is made using data on productivity of New York States Finger Lakes, [USA] before and after the state ban on phosphate detergents. Existing pre-ban data on mean summer phytoplankton standing crop are insufficient for conclusive evidence of a post-ban productivity change in individual lakes no matter how many years of post-ban data could be obtained. When the lakes are analyzed as a group rather than individually, there is a probability of only 0.7% that a chlorophyll drop at least as large as the one observed would have occurred without the effect of the phosphate detergent ban. Use of power calculations before sampling is begun will help to maximize the efficiency of data collection efforts in lake restoration programs.

For this purpose, we conducted extensive field campaigns under different hydrological phases: low-water (LW), rising-water (RW), high-water (HW), and falling-water (FW) phases from December 2016 to September 2017. The TSL ecosystem dis-tinctly exhibited seasonality of the monotonal flood pulse between the low-water and high-water peri-ods, in terms of not only water depth (range 0.5-8.0 m) but also water quality, suspended sediment, P dynamics (concentration, speciation and bioavailability), and trophic status. On an annual basis, the lake retained 56.2% of the external P loads, representing a major sink of P. Seasonally, P dynamics in TSL are determined by internal loading, whereas the annual inflows from the Mekong River basin and lake's tributaries are important sources of P for TSL. Total particulate phosphorus (TPP) constituted >60% of the total P in LW and decreased to <30% during HW, corresponding to the variation in total suspended solids (TSS). Soluble reactive P predominated the total dissolved P during LW (>70%) and decreased to approx. 30% during HW with decreasing TSS and TPP, suggesting the reduction of bioavailability of P in HW. Our results indicate that the flood pulse plays an important role in the chemical form and bioavailability of P in shallow lakes. (c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Merkel, A; Munnecke, A				Merkel, Anna; Munnecke, Axel			Glendonite-bearing concretions from the upper Pliensbachian (Lower Jurassic) of South Germany: indicators for a massive cooling in the European epicontinental sea	FACIES												The Pliensbachian-Toarcian transition was characterised by a drastic turnover from a cool climate to a period of rapid global warming. While the warming associated with the Early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event is rather well-studied, the cause, intensity and extent of the preceding cooling in the late Pliensbachian are still discussed. Occurrences of glendonite play an important role in this debate, since glendonite is a pseudomorph after the cryophilic carbonate mineral ikaite. This study describes the first glendonite-bearing carbonate concretions from South Germany (Buttenheim clay pit, northern Franconian Alb), which represent the southernmost glendonite occurrence in the late Pliensbachian documented so far. Based on petrographical and sedimentological investigations as well as stable isotope analyses it is concluded that a low temperature was the main factor for ikaite formation in the studied section, suggesting that the late Pliensbachian cooling had a more far-reaching impact on the temperature of the European epicontinental sea than previously assumed. To explain the low temperatures required for ikaite precipitation, a model for the sea-ice driven formation of cold bottom-water masses on the continental shelf is proposed. The occurrence of several layers containing reworked hiatus concretions in the studied outcrop is interpreted as the result of recurrent sea-level falls caused by multiple glacial pulses characterising the overall cool climate in the late Pliensbachian.					; Munnecke, Axel/G-3698-2010	Merkel, Anna/0009-0002-0648-1944; 													0172-9179	1612-4820				JUL	2023	69	3							10	10.1007/s10347-023-00667-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10347-023-00667-6													WOS:000989744300001

Water quality changes in south-central Ontario lakes and the role of local factors in regulating lake response to regional stressors	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The long-term monitoring of eight lakes near Dorset, Ontario, indicates that the water quality has changed significantly over the last 30 years. However, trends in the Dorset lakes may not be representative of changes in other south-central Ontario lakes, as the Dorset lakes are within a small area and span a limited gradient of lake and watershed characteristics. To determine the regional extent of water quality changes, we assessed the chemical changes in 36 diverse lakes that were first sampled between 1981 and 1990 and were resampled in 2004-2005. Similar to trends in the Dorset lakes, changes in the regional lakes included decreasing acidity, calcium, conductivity, metals, and phosphorus, and increasing dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, sodium, and chloride. Water quality changes were driven by regional stressors, including acidic deposition, climate, and lakeshore residential development. However, stressor-induced responses differed among lakes. Increases in sodium and chloride were greater in developed lakes that were close to winter-maintained roads. Site-specific characteristics, such as lake and watershed morphometry, could not explain heterogeneous changes in the remaining water quality parameters. These results indicate that other factors play an important role in regulating individual lake response to regional stressors.

The evolution of the Danube gateway between Central and Eastern Paratethys (SE Europe): Insight from numerical modelling of the causes and effects of connectivity between basins and its expression in the sedimentary record	TECTONOPHYSICS												The Pannonian and Dacic Basins in SE Europe are presently connected by the Danube River across the South Carpathians, to which they are in a back-arc and foreland position respectively. Part of the Paratethys realm during the Neogene, open water communication between the basins was interrupted by the Late Miocene uplift of the Carpathians. Different mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of the Danube gateway: capture of the upstream lake or an upstream river or incision of an antecedent river. Estimates on its age range from Late Miocene to Quaternary. A related issue is the effect of the large Mediterranean sea level fall related to the Messinian Salinity Crisis on the Paratethys subbasins, specifically the "isolated" Pannonian Basin. In a synthetic numerical modelling study, using a pseudo-3D code integrating tectonics, surface processes and isostasy, we addressed the causes and effects of changes in connectivity between two large sedimentary basins separated by an elevated barrier. Specifically, we aimed to find the expression of connectivity events in the sedimentary record in general and the consequences for the evolution of the Pannonian Dacic area in particular. We studied a range of parameters including the geometry and uplift rate of the barrier, downstream sea level change and lithosphere rigidity. We found that changes in connectivity are expressed in the sedimentary record through their effect on base level in the upstream basin and supply in the downstream basin. The most important factors controlling the response are the elevation difference between the basins and the upstream accommodation space at the time of reconnection. The most pronounced effect of reconnection through lake capture is predicted for a large elevation difference and limited upstream accommodation space. Downstream increase in sediment supply is dependent on the latter rather than the reconnection event itself. Of the parameters we tested, the rigidity of the lithosphere was found to be of major importance by its control on sediment loaded subsidence and generation of accommodation space. A downstream sea level change is unlikely to induce capture, but may affect the upstream lake level by enhancing incision in a pre-existing gateway. In the Pannonian Dacic region, the mechanically weak, continuously subsiding Pannonian lithosphere allowed accommodation of significant volumes of continental sedimentation and as a consequence, transfer of excess sediment to the downstream Dacic Basin was only gradual. The Messinian sea level fall in the Dacic Basin could have been recorded in the Pannonian Basin only if a connection between the basins already existed. More detailed modelling of river incision taking into account lateral differences in erodibility in the South Carpathians will be required to give better time constraints on the formation of the Danube Gateway.

The effects of 2,4-D on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), walleye (Sander vitreus), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and the amphipod Hyallela azteca were observed in static acute toxicity tests in the laboratory. The 96-hr LC5Os for brook trout, walleye, and fathead minnow were respectively 0.76, 0.66, and 2.22 mg/L. The 48-hr LC5O for H. azteca was 0.60 mg/L. During three summers in two different lakes, juvenile walleye, brook trout and/or fathead minnow held in screened enclosures were exposed to 2,4-D in a controlled manner when the lakes were selectively treated with the herbicide for routine plant control. Reference fishes held in untreated areas of the lakes were also monitored. Mortalities of fish of all species after one week were variable but were not significantly different between reference and treated fish of any of the three species.																			0270-5060					MAR	2006	21	1					163	168		10.1080/02705060.2006.9664109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2006.9664109													WOS:000235415800021
J	REUSS, JO				REUSS, JO			APPLICATION OF THE MAGIC MODEL TO THE GLACIER LAKES CATCHMENTS	USDA FOREST SERVICE ROCKY MOUNTAIN FOREST AND RANGE EXPERIMENT STATION RESEARCH PAPER												The MAGIC model (Cosby et al. 1985, 1986) was calibrated for East and West Glacier Lakes, two adjacent high-altitude (3200 m-3700 m) catchments in the Medicine Bow National Forest of southern Wyoming. This model uses catchment characteristics including weathering rates, soil chemical characteristics, hydrological parameters, and precipitation amounts and composition to calculate simulated lake and stream chemistry. The simulations suggest that if precipitation were acidified to pH 4.27 with sulfuric acid, the ANC of the lakes would rapidly drop by about 30 meq/M3 . This rapid drop would be followed by a further slow decline. Assuming precipitation pH of 4.27, only West Glacier Lake dropped to an average annual ANC less than 0 or a pH of less than 5.6 within a 100-year simulation. However, at this level of precipitation acidity, very acid conditions could be expected on a seasonal basis. If the precipitation pH were lowered to 4.5, monthly average ANC values likely would not fall below 0, but shorter-term acid events might well occur. The model could only be calibrated to current soil pH when input parameters allowed for at least 60 meq/ M3 of organic charge in the soil solution and when the aluminum solubility parameter was set for substantial undersaturation with respect to gibbsite. Important soil chemical characteristics can, therefore, be inferred by the use of such a model.																			0502-5001					JUN	1994		RM-315					1	&																WOS:A1994PE16400001

Digital humanities and tourism history	JOURNAL OF TOURISM HISTORY												This symposium considers how the digital humanities (DH), which relies on computer technology to interpret data and present conclusions, can enhance our understanding of tourism history. It begins with an introduction that defines DH, considers how DH can assist the way in which we think about tourism, and discusses the strengths and limitations of applications like text mining and digital mapping. This is followed by a review of the scholarship on digital mapping and the humanities which also highlights some of the important themes and projects that have sprung from this dynamic interdisciplinary dialogue. The latter half of the symposium is dedicated to two project reports. The first describes how the Grand Tour Project at Stanford University is utilizing a database of digital entries which combine digitised text and structured data to illuminate connections between eighteenth-century travellers. The second discusses how the Geospatial Innovation in the Digital Humanities project at Lancaster University is using geo-spatial technologies to examine the relationship between historically evolving ideas about tourist destinations in the Lake District and the contemporary management of such sites. The symposium concludes with some contemplation of the future developments in the realm of digital humanities and tourism history.

These species'' specific measures, thermal habitat area, THA (hectares per 10 d), and thermal habitat volume, THV (cubic hectometres per 10 d), were used as predictor variables in regression equations estimating the total sustained yield, SY (kilograms per year), of each of four commercially important species: lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush; lake whitefish, Coregonus clupeaformis; walleye, Stizostedion vitreum vitreum; and northern pike, Esox lucius. One or both of THA and THV were strongly correlated with SY for each of the four species for a set of 21 large north-temperate lakes. Several other habitat variables were assessed with respect to species'' SY: total lake area and volume, mean depth, total dissolved solids, and the ratio of the latter two as R. A.

Seven lakes and two pools that are characterized by different trophic levels were studied. The largest, Boeckella Lake, has an important outflow (Prasiola Stream) that was also analyzed. Ninety-seven algal taxa, including specific and infra-specific entities, are recorded. Thirty-one new records for the Antarctic continent are described and illustrated. The flora comprises 44.4% Cyanophyceae, 21.6% Bacillariophyceae, 18.5% Chlorophyceae, 9.3% Tribophyceae, 4.2% Chrysophyceae and 2% Zygophyceae. The epilithic flora of Hope Bay shows a high species richness. Phormidium fragile and Lyngbya lagerheimii were the most abundant species among the Cyanophyceae. In the algal mats we Chrysophyceae (mainly Hydrurus foetidus Chrysococcus rufescens) and the macroscopic chlorophycean Prasiola crispa. Tribonema australis sp. nov. (Tribonematales, Tribophyceae) is put forward as a new species.

Initiation of Convective Storms at Low-Level Mesoscale Boundaries in Southwestern Ontario	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												The relationship between low-level mesoscale boundaries and convective storm initiation was investigated in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The influence of lake-breeze fronts, a type of boundary that frequently affects this region of the Great Lakes watershed in summer, presented a particular interest. Radar data were processed using thunderstorm cell identification and tracking algorithms. The distances between the locations of storm cells reaching an intensity of 40 dBZ and the closest low-level mesoscale boundary were measured. Considering only days not influenced by a warm front, more than 75% of cells developed within 30 km of a low-level mesoscale boundary. Further examination by boundary type showed that cell initiations associated with moving boundaries and storm gust fronts occurred most often 0-5 km behind the boundaries. However, cell initiations associated with lake-breeze fronts most often occurred 0-5 km ahead of the boundaries. The analysis also suggested that lake-breeze fronts would often initiate the first storms of the day, which in turn generated gust fronts that could initiate subsequent storms. Overall, the results were similar to a previous study investigating storm initiation in the vicinity of low-level mesoscale boundaries in eastern Colorado and include some new findings in relation to lake-breeze fronts. The findings can be used by forecasters as well as automated nowcasting algorithms in order to improve predictions of storm initiation.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				APR	2018	33	2					583	598		10.1175/WAF-D-17-0086.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-17-0086.1													WOS:000435694400012

CDOM absorption, fluorescence, and the spectral slope indicating the CDOM composition were studied using 0.22-mu m-filtered samples of Meiliang Bay water from Lake Taihu that were exposed to short-term (0-12 h) simulated UV-B radiation and long-term (0-12 days) natural solar radiation in summer. CDOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence decreased with increasing exposure time, which relates to the amounts of absorbed light energy. The decreases of CDOM absorption and normalized fluorescence corresponded to first order kinetics reactions. Different decreases of CDOM absorption and fluorescence at different wavelengths suggested that the composition of CDOM changed when it absorbed ultraviolet radiation. Photochemical degradation increased the spectral slope during 275-295 nm region (S275-295) but decreased the spectral slope during 275-295 nm region (S350-400). The slope ratio S-R (S275-295: S350-400) increased in the photochemical process, which could be used as an indicator of photobleaching and composition change of CDOM. Our results show that photochemical degradation is important in the cycling of CDOM, which indicated change in the composition of CDOM.

By decomposing the variance of the model-simulated output from all scenario and model combinations, we identified the key sources of uncertainties of these future projections. There was generally a decline in the ecological state of the estuary in scenarios with a warmer climate. Strikingly, even the most nature-friendly land use scenario, where a proportion of the intensive agricultural area was converted to forest, may not be enough to counteract the negative effects of a future warmer climate on the ecological state of the estuary. The different land use scenarios were the most significant sources of uncertainty in the projections of future ecological state, followed, in order, by eco-hyclrological models and climate models, albeit all three sources caused high variability in the simulated outputs. Therefore, when projecting the future state of aquatic ecosystems in a global warming context, one should at the very least consider to evaluate an ensemble of land use scenarios (nutrient loads) but ideally also include multiple eco-hydrological models and climate change projections. Our study may set precedence for future attempts to predict and quantify uncertainties of model and model input ensembles, as this will likely be key elements in future tools for decision-making processes.

Intrapopulation variability in wolf diet revealed using a combined stable isotope and fatty acid approach	ECOSPHERE												Naturally occurring stable isotope ratios and fatty acids are two types of chemical biomarkers frequently used to quantitatively estimate consumer diets. Stable isotope values in animal tissues and diets have been evaluated using Bayesian mixing models to provide dietary estimates of consumers in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Fatty acids have primarily been used to examine diets of marine species. Using muscle and adipose tissue, we combined the two biomarkers in a Bayesian mixing model to generate quantitative diet estimates for gray wolves (Canis lupus, n = 78) in the southern Northwest Territories, Canada. Simulation experiments showed that the combined dataset led to more accurate and precise diet estimates than stable isotopes alone. Overall, bison (Bison bison athabascae) dominated the winter diet (63-96%) of wolves. In one region where bison were not readily available, wolf diet was more variable, with substantial contributions from boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), moose (Alces alces), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and beaver (Castor canadensis). Surprisingly, fish also comprised 5-26% of wolf diet in this region. Wolves likely scavenged on scraps left behind by commercial ice fishing operations on Great Slave Lake.

In this species, sex determination is considered to be governed by the interactions between a complex system of genetic sex determination factors (GSD) and the influence of temperature (TSD) during a critical period. Previous studies were exclusively carried out on domestic stocks with the genetic and maintenance limitations associated. Given the wide distribution and adaptation potential of the Nile tilapia, we investigated under controlled conditions the sex determination system of natural populations adapted to three extreme thermal regimes: stable extreme environments in Ethiopia, either cold temperatures in a highland lake (Lake Koka), or warm temperatures in hydrothermal springs (Lake Metahara), and an environment with large seasonal variations in Ghana (Kpandu, Lake Volta). The sex ratio analysis was conducted on progenies reared under constant basal (27 degrees C) or high (36 degrees C) temperatures during the 30 days following yolk-sac resorption. Sex ratios of the progenies reared at standard temperature suggest that the three populations share a similar complex GSD system based on a predominant male heterogametic factor with additional influences of polymorphism at this locus and/or action of minor factors. The three populations presented a clear thermosensitivity of sex differentiation, with large variations in the intensity of response depending on the parents. This confirms the presence of genotype-environment interactions in TSD of Nile tilapia. Furthermore the existence of naturally sex-reversed individuals is strongly suggested in two populations (Kpandu and Koka). However, it was not possible here to infer if the sex-inversion resulted from minor genetic factors and/or environmental influences. The present study demonstrated for the first time the conservation of a complex SDS combining polymorphic GSD and TSD components in natural populations of Nile tilapia. We discuss the evolutionary implications of our findings and highlight the importance of field investigations of sex determination. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have reported this pattern for terrestrial and macroscopic taxa; however, microscopic and aquatic communities have received much less attention in the literature. The aim of our study was to reveal the relationship between the habitat size and richness of freshwater benthic diatom assemblages. We hypothesized that if the size of studied water bodies covers wide spatial scales, the species-area relationship (SAR) could be described by a sigmoid model. Benthic diatom assemblages were investigated in pools, ponds and lakes of various sizes (10(-2)-10(8) m(2)). We demonstrated that although the SAR in the log-log space can be described by a linear model, the linear breakpoint regression provides better fit to data. Using this technique a characteristic small island effect (SIE) could be distinguished. The SIE fell in the range of 10(-2)-10(4) m(2). We also demonstrated that species richness of the diatom guilds is remarkably different in the various size ranges of the water bodies. We also demonstrated that the slope of the SAR (z value) is similar to those values that have been reported for other microbial organisms.

Response of dissolved organic matter to variation in nutrient availability and phytoplankton community composition in a mesotrophic, temperate-zone reservoir	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												The composition and concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwater ecosystems are influenced by the abundance and diversity of phytoplankton, which are, in turn, affected by nutrient availability. The interactions among DOM, phytoplankton, and nutrients are not fully understood, particularly regarding dissolved Si (DSi), a required nutrient for diatoms but generally not for other major phytoplankton groups. In this study, we sought to characterize the relationships among the optical properties of DOM, phytoplankton abundance (as chlorophyll a) and functional group relative biovolume, and nutrient concentrations (dissolved NO3-, soluble reactive P, dissolved organic C, and DSi) in a large reservoir in south-central Indiana, USA, a site representative of dimictic, mesotrophic reservoirs in temperate climates. We found that DOM composition varied throughout the summer growing season, and the variation was correlated to changes in phytoplankton abundance. We also found strong relationships between diatom biovolume, DSi concentrations, and the protein fractions of DOM, which indicates that the availability of DSi may influence the composition of DOM, likely mediated through the productivity of diatoms. This proposed relationship suggests changes in DSi availability could indirectly elicit responses in the composition, processing, and fate of DOM in freshwater systems. Describing these relationships in a reservoir is of particular interest given that dams drive changes in water retention time, light availability, and biogeochemical processes that affect DOM production and transformations. This novel coupling of C and Si cycling highlights the need to better understand controls on the sources and fates of C in reservoirs, particularly given the increase in dam construction across much of the world.

Intra-Annual Variability of Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo Electrofishing Data in Shallow Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Common Carp Cyprinus carpio and Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus are widespread across the Midwest, where they can achieve high population densities in shallow lakes. Despite their contrasting statuses as invasive and native fishes, these species are commonly managed together due to their capacity to have deleterious effects on water quality. However, intra-annual sampling variability is poorly understood for both species, making it difficult to track population changes. We compared boat electrofishing CPUE and proportional size distribution (PSD) of Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo during May-October 2018-2020 in seven shallow northwestern Iowa lakes. We also estimated sampling effort necessary to reach targets of fish captured (100) and precision (relative standard error < 25%) and to detect 25% and 50% differences in CPUE between samples. Common Carp CPUE peaked in June (29 fish/h), declined across the summer, and was lowest in October (9 fish/h). Bigmouth Buffalo CPUE exhibited bimodal peaks in May (16 fish/h) and October (12 fish/h), with low catches during August (2 fish/h). Common Carp size structure was largest during October (PSD of preferred-size fish [PSD-P] = 92) and smallest in July (PSD-P = 58). Bigmouth Buffalo size structure was smaller in June (PSD-P = 20) than in all other months (PSD-P = 34). Our targets for number of fish captured and precision were typically reached within twenty-five 15-min electrofishing transects for Common Carp during periods of high catch rates but were not reached after 100 transects for Bigmouth Buffalo in most cases. Our results suggest that timing of sampling is important for reliably and efficiently assessing Common Carp and Bigmouth Buffalo populations. We recommend the sampling of Common Carp with electrofishing during June and the sampling of Bigmouth Buffalo during May in Midwestern shallow lakes to maximize catch rates while minimizing the influence of seasonal sampling variability.					; Dixon, Philip/I-4843-2019; Simonson, Martin/KYQ-7158-2024	Weber, Michael/0000-0003-0430-3087; Simonson, Martin/0000-0002-1284-8055; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2023	43	2					556	568		10.1002/nafm.10877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10877		MAR 2023											WOS:000957203300001

Scott			Climatic control on the Holocene hydrology of a playa-lake system in the western Mediterranean	CATENA												Evaporitic lakes such as playa-lakes are characteristic of many arid regions and are unique environments with respect to fauna and flora, while being very vulnerable to climate and environmental fluctuations and threatened by the current global change scenario. Water balance oscillations in these systems can trigger the precipitation or dissolution of different evaporitic minerals, negatively impacting local biodiversity and economic activities. Here, we study the sedimentary record of a small saline pond from a playa-lake complex in southwestern Iberia in order to reconstruct the paleohydrological evolution of this area and assess potential anthropogenic disturbances. The different proxies studied in the-11.9 ky old sedimentary record of the Laguna de la Ballestera suggest that the greatest lake extension and the highest water levels occurred during the Early Holocene, pointing to the wettest period of the record. Climate transitioned towards more arid conditions during the Middle Holocene, and even more dramatically during the Late Holocene. In this last stage the wetland surface and the water level largely diminished and gypsum precipitation gradually increased pointing towards a negative precipitation/ evapotranspiration balance and lowest water levels. Summer desiccation likely occurred under this scenario, especially after-1.0-0.9 cal ky BP coeval with the Medieval Climate Anomaly, when gypsum content started to rise abruptly. However, this significant gypsum precipitation was only associated with a massive drop in the siliciclastic content and scarce carbonates (dolomite and calcite) during the last-400 years. This evidence suggests a shift from a (semi) permanent to a temporal/seasonal hydrological regime. The environmental evolution of this wetland responded to the general climatic evolution of the western Mediterranean during the Holocene, being mostly controlled by changes in insolation. Our data also show that the environmental response of the studied wetland to natural climate variations was only significantly disturbed by human activities since the 20th century, especially in the second half of the century, deduced by abrupt fluctuations in the siliciclastic, gypsum and organic content in the sediments, as well as by the enhanced sedimentary accumulation rates, probably as a response to changes in the hydroperiod of the lake and in the catchment land use.

J	Babcock, KW				Babcock, KW			The European corn borer Pyrausta nubilalis Hubn.: I. A discussion of its dormant period	ECOLOGY												Reactions of this insect to its environment were complex. It has 1 generation annually around Lake Erie and normally 2 generations in New England. Temp. in these 2 areas varies insufficiently to explain this behavior. The writer proposes 2 hypotheses to explain this behavior: (1) there are 2 types or "biological species" which have different inherent racial characteristics, each following the seasonal history possessed in its original habitat; (2) the difference in life-history and number of generations annually is determined by a combination of environmental factors. Experimental results are given to show that these differences may be explained in part by the 2nd hypothesis. Dormant larvae were collected and subjected to (a) normal, (b) cold dry, and (c) warm dry conditions to determine the effect upon subsequent development. Intervention of a dormant or "rest" period seems essential for the welfare of the species. The dormancy period is modified by environmental conditions; its inception is not initiated by a fall of temp. Temp. alone is not an important factor in breaking dormancy or hastening development. The chief requirements during the dormant period and preparation for emergence are continued exposure to cold accompanied by abundant contact moisture. If desiccation occurs during dor- mancy, retardation of pupation results; and if moisture loss is not compensated for before active development begins, the number of one generation individuals present in the decendants tends to increase. This effect appears to become cumulative in the race if the causes producing them are repeated.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1927	8						45	59		10.2307/1929385	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929385													WOS:000200148100004
J	LEONARDSON, L				LEONARDSON, L			DOES N-2 FIXATION MEET THE NITROGEN REQUIREMENTS OF HETEROCYSTOUS BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE IN SHALLOW EUTROPHIC LAKES	OECOLOGIA												Phytoplankton net C uptake and N fixation were studied in 2 shallow, eutrophic lakes in South Sweden. Ranges of diurnal net C uptake were estimated by subtracting 24-h respiration rates corresponding to 5-20% of Pmax, respectively, from daytime C uptake values. Total N requirement of the phytoplankton assemblage was determined from the diurnal net C uptake, assuming a phytoplankton C:N ratio of 9.5:1. N supplied by N fixation only occasionally corresponded to the demands of the total phytoplankton assemblage. When heterocystous algae made up a substantial proportion (.gtoreq. 10%) of the total phytoplankton biomass, N fixation could meet the requirements of heterocystous blue-green algae on .apprx. 50% of the sampling occasions. N deficiencies in heterocystous algae were most probably balanced by the simultaneous or sequential assimilation of dissolved inorganic N. Uptake of ammonium or nitrate, regenerated from lake seston and sediment, is the main process by which growth of phytoplankton is maintained during summer in the lake ecosystems studied.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1984	63	3					398	404		10.1007/BF00390672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00390672								28311218					WOS:A1984TH17400018

In addition to climate, the diversity of environments and plant communities on the Colorado Plateau has resulted from extreme topographic diversity. Desert lowlands as low as 360 m elevation are surrounded by forested plateaus, and even higher peaks greater than 3800 m elevation. This environmental diversity provides a unique opportunity to study the history of biotic communities in an arid region of North America. Although the Colorado Plateau harbours numerous potential sites, the paleoecological record of the Plateau is poorly known. Potential deposits for analysis include packrat middens, alluvial and cave sites at lower elevations, and lake, bog and wetland sites at higher elevations. Forty-six sites have been analysed across the nearly 337,000 km(2) region, of which 27 contain records that span Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage (IS) 2 data, with IS 3 information coming from only 12 sites. Most IS 2 and 3 sites are clustered along the lowland regions of the Colorado River corridor and the uplands of the Mogollon Rim area. We compiled selected data from long paleoecological records to examine patterns of vegetation and climate change across the southern Colorado Plateau for the middle and late Wisconsin. During the middle Wisconsin, mixed conifers covered middle-elevations presently dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and juniper (Juniperus) woodland grew at elevations today covered by blackbrush (Coleogyne) and sagebrush (Artemisia) desert. During the late Wisconsin, boreal conifers, primarily Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), replaced the mixed conifer association. Estimates of mean annual temperatures (MAT) during IS 3 were at least 3-4 degrees C cooler than today, whereas IS 2 MAT estimates are at least 5 degrees C colder. Our investigation of millennial-scale climatic variability within the region provided equivocal results. The packrat midden sequence could not distinguish vegetation changes that might be associated with Heinrich events in the North Atlantic. From the lake records, however, many Heinrich events were associated with generally drier intervals, often with elevated sagebrush pollen concentrations. Future paleoecological investigations should concentrate on the northern Colorado Plateau, as well as the eastern and western margins. Additional sites, along with closer-spaced sampling in regions already studied, will be important in determining the history of important climatic phenomena such as the timings of the Arizona monsoon.

S.; Juyal, Navin			The Holocene floods and their affinity to climatic variability in the western Himalaya, India	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The present study in the middle Satluj valley explores the sedimentary records of past floods with an objective to understand the climatic processes responsible for their genesis. Based on lithostratigraphy, sedimentology, and grain size variability, 25 flood events are identified. The geochemical data indicate that the flood sediments were mostly generated and transported from the higher Himalayan crystalline and the trans-Himalaya. Our study suggests that the floods were generated by Landslide Lake Outburst Floods (LLOFs) during extreme precipitation events. However, the existing database does not allow us to negate the contribution from Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Field stratigraphy supported by optical chronology indicates four major flood phases that are dated to 13.4-10.4, 8.3-3.6, 2.2-1.4, and < 1.4 ka (kilo-annum). These phases correspond to the cooler and less wet conditions and broadly correlate with the phases of negative Arctic Oscillation (AO) and negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Thus, implying coupling between the moisture-laden monsoon circulation and southward penetrating mid-latitude westerly troughs for extreme precipitation events and consequent LLOFs. Additionally, a broad synchronicity in Holocene floods between the western Himalaya and across the mid latitudinal region (30 degrees N-40 degrees N) suggests a synoptic scale Arctic and Atlantic climate variability.

J	Andrén, C; Jarlman, A				Andren, Cecilia; Jarlman, Arnelie			Benthic diatoms as indicators of acidity in streams	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												As acidification changes from chronic to more episodic in nature, staudy focus shifts from lakes, where the basin moderates acidity. to streams where acid episodes occur. To assess the effects of acid stress, several macroinvertebrate indices have been used in Scandinavia and elsewhere, based on the presence or absence of species. Benthic diatoms are strongly linked to water quality with small spatial influence, and display a broad spectrum of species. An acidity index for streams based on benthic diatoms could retine assessment resolution, which is required as the acidification declines. During the autumns of 2004 and 2005, 99 benthic diatom samples were collected from 75 humic streams in Sweden that were monitored by monthly water sampling. The relationships between benthic diatoms and measured environmental variables were explored using canonical correspondence analysis. Acidity was the principal factor influencing the diatoms, with the highest eigenvalues noted for pH, both using 50 streams aluminium. Several weighted averaging (WA) models were developed to infer stream pH, both using 50 streams from 2004 as a calibration dataset cross-validated with 49 streams from 2005 as an independent dataset, and by modeling all 99 streams. The predictive power of the WA models was good. The model with all streams showed a high correlation for mean pH (r(2)=0.85) and minimum pH (r(2)=0.74) values. An acidity index for diatoms. ACID, was proposed. The correlations to mean and minimum pH values were strong, r(2)=0.85 and 0.77, respectively, Our results confirmed a strong link between benthic diatoms and water quality, particularly acidity. By employing different approaches we demonstrated that diatoms are excellent acidity indicators. The proposed ACID index can be used to assess the acidity state of a stream. ACID is more convenient to use than a WA model for pH and has equal precision.																			1863-9135						2008	173	3					237	253		10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0173-0237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0173-0237													WOS:000262846200006

This paper describes the development of a landslide susceptibility map and threshold for riverbank erosion-triggered landslides in a northern climate with atypical landslide conditions. Located on the southern shore of Lake Superior, the Ontonagon River basin in northern Michigan receives an average of 4.8 m of snowfall annually, followed in the spring by a sharp warming trend and rain. Undercutting of the steep riverbanks causes large failures that continuously threaten bridges and a nearby hydroelectric facility. In this investigation, a landslide inventory was mapped using aerial imagery from 1992 to 2016. Landslide triggering factors were interpreted using temperature, cumulative precipitation, and river discharge data, demonstrating that river discharge is the primary predictor of landslides despite the source being either rainfall or snowmelt. A preliminary threshold was then created to determine the discharge characteristics likely to cause failures. A susceptibility map was created for the river system using a combination of Scoops3D with logistic regression, improving overall accuracy to 93%. Furthermore, Scoops3D proved valuable in constraining the model to failures of engineering significance (large volume and impact) and kinematic possibility. The threshold-susceptibility scheme is thus a powerful tool for assessing comprehensive slope stability along river channels.

Synoptic surveys were conducted during the summer of 1986 to determine background conditions and the response to stormwater runoff inputs of three metals; copper, lead and cadmium. Background (dry weather) conditions of all three metals were found to be significantly different than those reported for world natural waters. Significant amounts of lead and copper were found to be input to the system through a major storm water sewer that discharges to a lagoon. Sediment analysis showed that considerable sedimentation occurs in this lagoon, thus localizing the effect of this input to the system. A local stormwater retention basin was not found to be a significant source of metals. Cadmium levels were not found to be significantly different between dry and wet weather conditions. The high salinity of the system required extensive sample extraction procedures prior to analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry to minimize matrix interferences.																			0730-7268	1552-8618					1990	9	5					559	567		10.1002/etc.5620090504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620090504													WOS:A1990DD72300004

Five larval instars were demonstrated. The differences in temporal composition of instars indicated 3 different life cycles. A bivoltine strategy was shown for the most exposed locality which also had the highest average abundance equal to 11,500 individuals m-2. A univoltine population was found in the more sheltered NW part of the lake with an average density of 1500 individuals m-2. At the 3 remaining stations the life cycles were partly bivoltine with wintering populations of mixed cohorts and densities between 10,500 and 3000 individuals m-2. Two distinct flight periods with maxima in June and Aug. were demonstrated for bi- and partly bivoltine populations. Differences in rates of growth and elimination added to the variability in life cycle. Growth rates peaked in Aug. (5.0-7.4% day-1) at an average temperature of 20.degree. C. Estimates of production ranged from 1.9-17.5 g AFDW [ash free dry weight] m-2 a-1 with an average of 8.0 g AFDW m-2. The P/B [population to biomass] ratios, which were within the expected range for uni- and bivoltine populations of trichopterans, were 5.73 for the bivoltine population and 3.31 for the univoltine population. Estimates of consumption revealed that the populations could be sustained by autochthonous epilithic production in the habitats. Variability in the quality and seasonal availability of food were judged to influence the type of life cycle.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	112	2					93	104		10.1007/BF00006912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006912													WOS:A1984SU19900002

According to certain pollen records, forest expansion occurred in many areas several millennia after what is considered worldwide as the onset of the Holocene. The current problem we face is that the time lag in forest expansion varies from one sequence to another, sometimes with no delay at all. Moreover, the potential forcing/controlling factors behind this complex pattern, contrary to the almost synchronous global Holocene warming, are still a matter for debate. Accordingly, we revisit the issue of forest expansion through vegetation history obtained in the South Caucasus using a new pollen record, retrieved from the Nariani paleolake (South Georgia). These data attest to a steppic phase, initially dominated by Amaranthaceae-Chenopodiaceae (12,700-10,500 cal yr BP), then by Poaceae (10,500-9000 cal yr BP), culminating with a more forested phase (9000-5000 cal yr BP). Although some palaeoclimatic regional reconstructions show a wet early Holocene, we interpret the delay in forest expansion recorded in Nariani (2500 years) as the result of reduced spring precipitation, which would have limited forest development at that time.					; Joannin, Sebastien/C-8324-2012; Wilhelm, Bruno/B-9265-2013; von Grafenstein, Ulrich/F-6991-2010; Lordkipanidze, David/AAH-6472-2020; Messager, Erwan/N-6623-2014; messager, erwan/N-6623-2014	Ollivier, Vincent/0000-0002-4326-6891; Joannin, Sebastien/0000-0001-8345-9252; Belmecheri, Soumaya/0000-0003-1258-2741; von Grafenstein, Ulrich/0000-0002-3338-5627; Messager, Erwan/0000-0001-5192-9088; Nomade, Sebastien/0000-0001-7373-0571; Martkoplishvili, Inga/0000-0002-0893-7119; 													0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2017	87	1					121	132		10.1017/qua.2016.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2016.3													WOS:000400327700008

The 3 long-term cycles, SQ1, SQ2 and SQ3 correspond to the members Qing I, Qing II and Qing III of the Qingshankou Formation, spanning 11.5 Ma during the Late Cretaceous. The time scale of the medium-term cycles, which are subunits of the long-term cycles, is approximately 0.5-1.5 Ma with thicknesses ranging from 45 m to 116 m. A shallow-water delta that consists of high-maturity fine-grained sandstone developed in the Qingshankou Formation. The scour surfaces reflect strong flow action, and the parallel bedding and large-scale cross bedding are well developed. Distributary channel sandstones are well developed in the shallow-water delta depositional system, in which a single channel can be several meters thick. The cumulative thickness of the distributary channels can reach tens of meters across a large area, extending tens of kilometers to the center of the lacustrine basin. The development of the subaqueous distributary channel of the shallow-water delta is closely related to base level (lake level) changes. In the early stage of a rising half-cycle and the late stage of a falling half-cycle, the fluviation is significant and the well-developed channel sandstone can extend towards the center of the lacustrine basin more than 50 km, with large cumulative thicknesses of compound sandbodies (17-28 m) and high sandstone-to-strata ratios (78-88%). In the late stage of a rising half-cycle and the early stage of a falling half-cycle, the lake level is high and the fluviation is weak, resulting in a distributary channel extent of less than 30 km, small cumulative thicknesses of compound sandbodies (5-12 m) and low sandstone-to-strata ratios (22-45%). The delta front can be divided into the inner front and the outer front. The subaqueous distributary channels in the inner front have good continuity and extend further, whereas the subaqueous distributary channels in the outer front have poor continuity, and sheet sand is well developed. Therefore, a shallow-water delta generally shows features including (1) sedimentary structures formed by strong currents, (2) stacked fining upward rhythm, (3) subaqueous distributary channels well developed, (4) delta front divided further into an inner and an outer front. There was a relatively good linear relationship between the thickness of the sandbody based on the well data and the maximum amplitude of the seismic trace next to the well. The reddish amplitude of the seismic attribution suggests thicker channel sandbodies (4-9 m), whereas the light amplitude of the seismic attribution indicates thinner channel sandbody (1-4 m). Of the two typical sedimentary models for shallow water deltas, delta plains develop well in humid climates and delta fronts develop well in arid climates, both of which are found in the Qijia area, Songliao Basin. Stratal slices from seismic geomorphology are applied to display the branchlike sandstone dispersal patterns of the shallow-water delta and the broad distribution characteristics. This study also notes that the delta front distributary channel sandstone, which is near an oil source and faults, would be a favorable exploration target.

J	Kohl, JG; Henze, R; Kuhl, H				Kohl, JG; Henze, R; Kuhl, H			Evaluation of the ventilation resistance to convective gas-flow in the rhizomes of natural reed beds of Phragmites australis (Cav) Trin ex Steud	AQUATIC BOTANY												The ventilation resistance of the internal gas-space system of common reed rhizomes (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.) to convective gas through-flow was studied at reed stands of different lakes with respect to reed die-back. Some parameters for evaluating the contribution of the culms in ventilating the rhizomes are calculated. This involves the culm's own pressure development (P-c), the counter-pressure within the rhizomes measured at the bottom of the culm (stubble; P-s), and the resistance of the connected rhizome against gas-flow. The advantage of the relation between counter-pressure of rhizomes to the potential pressure differential of the culms (P-s/P-c) and the ventilation resistance parameter (VRP) is that they are not dependent on the actual pressurization due to changing weather conditions. A comparison of different sites is possible even when measured at different times. Most of the reed stands so far investigated show low resistances to convective gas-flow during summer but an increase in resistance was measured during the later vegetation season. Low numbers of old culms functioning as efflux culms can at least partly be compensated by the functional change of living shoots to efflux culms. The gas composition of these green shoots and the dead efflux culms is lower in oxygen and higher in carbon dioxide than influx culms, and additionally methane is present. Very high resistances against gas through-flow could only be detected at sites where the formerly homogeneous distribution of the shoots was changed to a cluster-like distribution with only few or no old culms.																			0304-3770					JUL	1996	54	2-3					199	210		10.1016/0304-3770(96)82383-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(96)82383-7													WOS:A1996VJ75500010

A 170-cm-long sediment core covering the last 7,400 years was collected from Lake Xingxinghai (XXH) in the YRSA. Pollen, together with a series of other environmental proxies (including grain size, total organic carbon (TOC) and carbonate content), were analysed to explore past vegetation and environmental changes for the YRSA. Dominant and common pollen components-Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae and Asteraceae-are stable throughout the last 7,400 years. Slight vegetation change is inferred from an increasing trend of Cyperaceae and decreasing trend of Poaceae, suggesting that alpine steppe was replaced by alpine meadow at ca. 3.5 ka cal bp. The vegetation transformation indicates a generally wetter climate during the middle and late Holocene, which is supported by increased amounts of TOC and Pediastrum (representing high water-level) and is consistent with previous past climate records from the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results find no evidence of human impact on the regional vegetation surrounding XXH, hence we conclude the vegetation change likely reflects the regional climate signal.

Soil erosion and the associated outwash of nutrients are a main cause of eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. Despite the great challenges of water protection in the face of climate change, large uncertainties remain concerning the timescales for recovery of aquatic ecosystems impacted by hypoxia. This study seeks to address this issue by investigating the sedimentary record of Lake Murten (Switzerland), which witnessed several phases of intensive human land-use over the past 2000 years. Application of geophysical and geochemical methods to a 10 m-long sediment core revealed that soil erosion increased drastically with the rise of the Roman City of Aventicum (30 CE). During this period, the radiocarbon age of the bulk sedimentary organic carbon (OC) increasingly deviated from the modeled deposition age, indicating rapid flushing of old soil OC from the surrounding catchment driven by intensive land-use. Enhanced nutrient delivery resulted in an episode of cultural eutrophication, as shown by the deposition of varved sediments. Human activity drastically decreased towards the end of the Roman period (3rd century CE), resulting in land abandonment and renaturation. Recovery of the lake ecosystem from bottom-water hypoxia after the peak in human activity took around 50 years, while approximately 300 years passed until sediment accumulation reached steady state conditions on the surrounding landscape. These findings suggest that the legacy of anthropogenic perturbation to watersheds may persist for centuries. (C) 2018 The Authors.

J	Li, LL; Yan, RH				Li, Lingling; Yan, Renhua			Patterns and Drivers of CO2 and CH4 Fluxes in an Urbanized River Network and Their Response to Restoration	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Carbon evasion from urban river networks becomes increasingly significant as urbanization accelerates. However, there remains a limited understanding of the overall carbon emission impact integrating CO2 and CH4 dynamics, particularly in response to ecological restoration efforts. In this study, we investigated patterns of fluvial CO2 and CH4 diffusive fluxes across an urban river network in Wuxi, China. Our results reveal that water quality variables, especially dissolved oxygen (DO) and phosphorus content, predominantly influence the variability of carbon emissions. These factors exhibit a stronger correlation with CO2 emissions compared to CH4, indicating a net increase in carbon emissions as water quality deteriorates. Seasonally, higher water temperatures, phosphate levels, and lower DO concentrations lead to increased carbon emissions during summer months. Spatially, areas with lower carbon emissions (averaged 86 mmol m-2 d-1 CO2 and 0.13 mmol m-2 d-1 CH4) are primarily situated near the lake and in river sections where significant water quality improvements have been achieved through ecological restoration efforts. Cluster analysis shows that over 60% of high-carbon emission (averaged 162 mmol m-2 d-1 CO2 and 1.21 mmol m-2 d-1 CH4) sites in the study area have undergone ecological restoration, suggesting potential for further carbon emission reduction through enhanced restoration practices. Our findings underscore the importance of implementing carbon reduction strategies such as nutrient removal and aeration for oxygenation within water ecological restoration initiatives. Effective matching of restoration strategies holds further potential for mitigating carbon emissions from urban river networks.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				NOV	2024	129	11							e2024JG008329	10.1029/2024JG008329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JG008329													WOS:001368082700001

In this study, the relationships between the operational phases and the water quality of the limnological zones were assessed for the Amazonian reservoir Tucurui. Limnological zones were clustered by means of an artificial neural network technique, and inputs used were water quality variables, measured at twelve stations between 2006 and 2016. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were then used to identify the influence of the operational phases of the reservoir on the water quality of its limnological zones. The GLM with a gamma-distributed response variable indicated that Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the riverine and transitional zones differed notably from those observed in the lacustrine zone. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were significantly lower during the operational falling water phase than in the low water phase (p < 0.05). The GLM with an inverse Gaussian-distributed response variable indicated that Secchi depth was significantly lower in the riverine than in the lacustrine limnological zone (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that more eutrophic conditions occur during the operational rising water phase, and that the area most vulnerable to eutrophication is the transitional zone. We demonstrate that the use of GLMs is suitable for determining areas and operational phases most vulnerable to eutrophication. We envisage that this information will be useful to decision-makers when monitoring the water quality of hydroelectric reservoirs with dendritic patterns and dynamic operational phases.

The region in which the analysed object is located has the greatest water deficits in Poland. The co-occurrence of unfavourable natural and anthropogenic factors contributed to a considerable reduction in the water resources retained in the lake. Particularly low water levels were recorded in the 1990s and in the first decade of the 21st century. The situation was not improved by a water dam constructed on the outflow from the lake in the 1960s, due, among other things, to neglect in its exploitation. With regard to the modernisation of the dam in 2010 and the favourable hydrological situation in the winter of 2011, it was possible to retain the excess water and substantially reduce its outflow. The restoration of the lost water resources, and the hydrological benefits of this were still observable several years later. Problems related to water deficits are becoming increasingly common in many regions of the world. One solution to mitigate such a situation may be, among others, to dam natural lakes. This is simpler, cheaper, and less invasive for the environment than the construction of new water reservoirs.

J	TORREY, MS; LEE, GF				TORREY, MS; LEE, GF			NITROGEN-FIXATION IN LAKE MENDOTA, MADISON, WISCONSIN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The effects of various environmental conditions, and of cell composition, heterocyst content and N content of algal samples, on fixation of N2 by colonial and filamentous algae in Lake Mendota [USA] were investigated. Heterocyst content and temperature were significantly and positively related to acetylene reduction activity (N2 fixation); depth of sample collection was negatively related. Available data do not show whether statistical correlations of acetylene reduction activity with dissolved O2 and pH represent specific effects of O2 and pH on this activity, or simply reflect chemical changes caused by algal photosynthesis. During summer stratification, when surface-water content of combined inorganic N was severely depleted, N2 fixation asssociated with heterocystous blue-green algae contributed 85% of the total N2 fixed. Bacterial N2 fixation was low compared to that of algae. Despite its small overall contribution to the animal N budget (38,000 kg N; about 7% of the total input), N2 fixation is significant in maintaining blue-green algal nuisances in surface water when non-N2-fixing phytoplankton cannot compete effectively.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1976	21	3					365	378		10.4319/lo.1976.21.3.0365	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1976.21.3.0365													WOS:A1976BS77000003

The decline in oxygen concentrations was attributed to a recent severe infestation by the invading zebra mussel. Zebra mussel densities of 33 000-61 000 individuals m(-2) were found in a 1.4-km section, across which an average (n = 3) depletion in DO concentration of about 1.7 mg L(-1) was observed. The estimated areal respiration rate for the zebra mussel population in this section (34 g m(-2) d(-1)) nearly matched the areal sink calculated independently from DO budget calculations (44 g m(-2) d(-1)). The zebra mussels also caused substantial decreases in phytoplankton biomass and increases in water clarity over the study reach. Loss in waste assimilative capacity is expected to occur in other alkaline hardwater rivers and streams with rock substrate in North America as the zebra mussel invasion spreads.																			0013-936X					NOV	1994	28	12					2216	2221		10.1021/es00061a034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00061a034								22191765					WOS:A1994PP82900036
C	Mamo, ZC		Brandeis, A		Mamo, Zegeye Cherenet			Changing patterns: Major Water-Bodies and Urbanization in Ethiopia	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 50TH ISOCARP CONGRESS: URBAN TRANSFORMATIONS: CITIES AND WATER					50th ISOCARP Congress	SEP 23-26, 2014	Gdynia, POLAND	ISOCARP				Ethiopian urban settings seem to defy the common notion about water bodies and sites surrounding them as the favorites for locating cities or the notion of large water bodies as facilitators of urbanization. In the presence of large water-bodies - major rivers and significant number of lakes, urban centers and dense settlements in Ethiopia seem to predominantly prefer highland sites- distancing from major water bodies and relying on springs, smaller rivers and seasonal rain for their water source. The article claims that this longstanding pattern is changing with sites around major water bodies becoming increasingly contested for both habitation and production (agricultural or industrial) - instigating a new socio-spatial pattern, which demands an appropriate hydro-social organization. Fueled by poverty; steady population growth; determined need for economic development; and the fragility of the regional ecological balance, the paper assumes that this emerging pattern, if not sensitively guided, can become a cause for additional challenge within the large scale environmental and socio-political relations. Hence, in an attempt to establish a basic understanding, the article discusses the nature of the relationship of water bodies and urbanization pattern in Ethiopian urban tradition. It discusses the forces which confined Ethiopian urbanization on highlands and distanced it from major water bodies. Moreover, it traces changes within these forces in order to establish the contextual basis for the emerging patter. In conclusion, it highlights the possible impacts of such changes on policy and planning practice in Ethiopia.																					978-94-90354-30-5				2014							382	393																WOS:000360101000034

This wetland area has reduced from 1875.04 ha in 1969 to 1300 ha in 2008 due to several reasons, viz, encroachments and pollution. Keeping these facts in view, the present study was carried out to determine the impact of anthropogenic activities on the water quality of the wetland. Standard methods were used for analyzing various physico-chemical characteristics of water of a wetland. Among all the four sites, inlet sampling site was having the highest mean value of turbidity (2.06 NTU), water temperature (23.55 ?), electrical conductivity (0.233 dS/m), nitrate-nitrogen (0.046 mg/L), nitrite nitrogen (0.681 mg/L), ammoniacal nitrogen (0.210 mg/L), calcium (48.60 mg/L), phosphate (0.071 mg/L), and potassium (0.456 mg/L). The highest mean value (11.34 mg/L) of magnesium was recorded at the outlet, also having maximum pH (7.10). The lowest mean values of all physico-chemical characteristics of water were observed at the outlet site except for pH and Mg. The highest mean value was found for water temperature (27.25 ?), EC (0.228 dS/m, nitrate-nitrogen (0.485 mg/L), nitrite-nitrogen (0.035 mg/L), ammoniacal nitrogen (0.196 mg/L), Ca (58.08 mg/L), phosphate (0.047 mg/L), and K (0.480 mg/L) during summer season. A decreasing trend of trace metal concentration at different site in all seasons was observed in the following order: inlet (polluted) > center > Trapa abundance site > outlet. Similarly, COD and BOD values ranged from 69.69 to 115.89 mg/L and 56.08 to 95.05 mg/L in three different seasons, respectively. The wetland's BOD level (95.05 mg/L) is too high, indicating high pollution level. The results of the present study have indicated that the pollutants and trace elements find their entry into the aquatic ecosystem and are a matter of great concern.

A 950 yr temperature reconstruction from Duckhole Lake, southern Tasmania, Australia	HOLOCENE												A lack of quantitative high resolution paleoclimate data from the Southern Hemisphere limits the ability to examine current trends within the context of long-term natural climate variability. This study presents a temperature reconstruction for southern Tasmania based on analyses of a sediment core from Duckhole Lake (43.365 degrees AS, 146.875 degrees E). The relationship between non-destructive whole core scanning reflectance spectroscopy measurements in the visible spectrum (380-730 nm) and the instrumental temperature record (AD 1911-2000) was used to develop a calibration-in- time reflectance spectroscopy-based temperature model. Results showed that a trough in reflectance from 650 to 700 nm, which represents chlorophyll and its derivatives, was significantly correlated to annual mean temperature. A calibration model was developed (R = 0.56, p(auto) < 0.05, root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) = 0.21 degrees C, five-year filtered data, calibration period 1911-2000) and applied down-core to reconstruct annual mean temperatures in southern Tasmania over the last c. 950 years. This indicated that temperatures were initially cool c. ad 1050, but steadily increased until the late ad 1100s. After a brief cool period in the ad 1200s, temperatures again increased. Temperatures steadily decreased during the ad 1600s and remained relatively stable until the start of the 20th century when they rapidly decreased, before increasing from ad 1960s onwards. Comparisons with high resolution temperature records from western Tasmania, New Zealand and South America revealed some similarities, but also highlighted differences in temperature variability across the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. These are likely due to a combination of factors including the spatial variability in climate between and within regions, and differences between records that document seasonal (i.e. warm season/late summer) versus annual temperature variability. This highlights the need for further records from the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere in order to constrain past natural spatial and seasonal/annual temperature variability in the region, and to accurately identify and attribute changes to natural variability and/or anthropogenic activities.

The monthly water areas of the lakes during the period from March to October are calculated, the change characteristics of the water areas of the lakes in the watery and dry seasons and the intermonthly change characteristics are preliminarily understood. The results show that the watery seasons of the Ebinur, Bosten and Aydingkol lakes are the periods from November to April, from December to March, and from January to April, and their dry seasons are the periods from May to October, from April to October and from May to November, respectively. The factors influencing the water area of Ebinur Lake are analyzed by combining the climatic factors. The results show that, except the artificial water consumption, the factors directly influencing water area of Ebinur Lake are mainly the depth of snow cover on the riparian areas in winter, seasonal precipitation, evaporation and sunshine duration. The strong winds from Alataw Mountain Pass impact seriously the ecological environment in the Ebinur Lake region and its basin. Some practical and effective measures should be taken for controlling the sand drift and for protecting the environment of the lacustrine wetlands in the and areas.																			0277-786X		0-8194-4676-9				2003	4890		1&2				276	284		10.1117/12.466184	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.466184													WOS:000184693700028

Effects of surface aerators on controlling eutrophication were examined in two urban ponds, in which anaerobic odors and cyanobacterial blooms had occurred and several aerators had been installed. In one of the ponds, a dramatic improvement in dissolved oxygen (DO) (from 1.8 to 8.1 mg L-1) and total phosphorus (TP) (from 1.6 to 0.4 mg L-1) was evident based on the comparison before and after the aeration. Although cyano-bloom did not occur, phytoplankton was dominated by cyanobacteria Microcystis species in both periods. Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) increased (from 29 to 51 mu g L-1) and water transparency decreased (from 81 to 27 cm) after the aeration. In the other pond with an irregular shape, water quality was monitored two years after the installation to examine seasonal variation in trophic state and its spatial variation associated with aerator distribution. The water was mixed vertically well for the whole pond, as indicated by small surface-to-bottom differences in temperature. DO decreased in summer after rainfall but was always >5.7 mg L-1. Total nitrogen (TN) and TP were 0.8-2.3 and 0.03-0.07 mg L-1, respectively, and no cyano-blooms were observed across sites throughout the year. Phytoplankton was dominated by green algae and diatom species, which may be favored by the lower phosphorus level of the pond. Chl-a was higher and transparency was lower in the north side, which had more aerators and less shade from trees and buildings. These results suggest that surface aerators increased DO by vertical and horizontal mixing of water, reduced phosphorus release from sediment, and prevented cyano-bloom occurrence, but they did not improve Chl-a level and transparency. Rather, aeration can promote algal growth, and thus, additional purifying measures such as filtration and contact oxidation are required to further improve the trophic state of these ponds.					; Zhao, Mingyu/HHS-0141-2022	Zhao, Min/0000-0001-7950-5279; , Sohei/0000-0002-0350-1922; 														2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	23							3360	10.3390/w13233360	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13233360													WOS:000735122600001

Understanding the hydrological functioning of this kind of infrastructures is crucial for efficient water management in areas where water resources are often scarce. In this line, we have analyzed temporal patterns of water availability in a set of watering ponds located in Iberian rangelands and their relationship with temporal rainfall variability. In addition, the effectiveness of the ponds for conserving stored water during dry periods and some influencing factors (pond size and catchment area) have also been assessed. The results showed a high correlation between water availability and precedent rainfall, confirming, on the one hand, the capacity of storage of these infrastructures and, on the other hand, the importance of temporal rainfall patterns in their hydrological behavior. Our findings point to a minimum pond area of 2000 m(2) and a catchment area/storage capacity ratio around 100 m(-1) in order for watering ponds can face the dry summer period with certain guarantees, at least in regular hydrological years. Nonetheless, the vulnerability shown by the majority of the watering ponds in times of drought limits their usefulness as unique sources of water supply in many farms.

Maximum depth of submerged plant colonization could be predicted from the light extinction coefficient (r(2) = 0.82) and Secchi disk depth (r(2) = 0.80). The aboveground and total biomass of macrophytes were related to a variety of environmental variables as follows in descending order of importance: exposure to wind and waves, plant growth forms, water depth, and light intensity. Together, these variables accounted for 67 and 74% of sampling variability of aboveground and total biomass, respectively. These environmental Variables were used to elaborate hierarchical predictive models of aboveground and total biomass of emergent and submerged macrophytes. The empirical relationship that links St. Lawrence River and Ottawa River aquatic plants to environmental variables may eventually allow us to forecast wetland response to changes in water levels and water clarity resulting from climate variability and (or) discharge regulation.

Dreissena population status in nearshore Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dreissenid mussels are ecosystem engineers in the Great Lakes, affecting benthic and water column communities and production. We surveyed mussel populations at four Canadian and three U.S. locations in summer 2008 to update population status and examine correlations with water column data. We measured mussel length, density, shell-free dry mass (SFDM), condition index, and phosphorus content of both shells and mussel tissue. The water column variables of chlorophyll a, turbidity, and total phosphorus (TP) were correlated with each other lake-wide, but exhibited only a few correlations with mussel metrics within seasons or shorelines. Quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) represented similar to 99% of the mussel community in nearshore collections. Mussel length declined in a west-to-east direction and increased with depth in both U.S. and Canadian nearshore waters. Mussel density declined west-to-east in U.S. water, but exhibited no difference among sites in Canadian waters. Mussel condition index and phosphorus concentrations were correlated and increased west-to-east within the U.S. nearshore. There were significant declines in both tissue and shell P content with season in U.S. mussels, but no clear patterns in Canadian mussels. We estimated there were 9.7 x 10(12) mussels (mean = 3402.9/m(2)) in the Lake Ontario nearshore totalling 1.2 x 10(5) mT of mussel tissue which could filter the entire Lake Ontario nearshore volume (0-20 m depth = 30.9 km(3)) in roughly 1 to 7 days. It appears that mussel density has declined since the last large surveys of 5 or 10 years ago (Canadian nearshore or U.S. nearshore, respectively), however the data were either only slightly supportive of, or showed no support for, food limitation or goby predation as the most parsimonious explanation for the decline in mussel abundance.

Here, we show that climate-driven thaw of hilltop ice-wedge networks is rapidly transforming uplands across Banks Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Change detection using high-resolution WorldView images and historical air photos, coupled with 32-year Landsat reflectance trends, indicate broad-scale increases in ponding from ice-wedge thaw on hilltops, which has significantly affected at least 1500 km(2) of Banks Island and over 3.5% of the total upland area. Trajectories of change associated with this upland ice-wedge thermokarst include increased micro-relief, development of high-centred polygons, and, in areas of poor drainage, ponding and potential initiation of thaw lakes. Millennia of cooling climate have favoured ice-wedge growth, and an absence of ecosystem disturbance combined with surface denudation by solifluction has produced high Arctic uplands and slopes underlain by ice-wedge networks truncated at the permafrost table. The thin veneer of thermally-conductive mineral soils strongly links Arctic upland active-layer responses to summer warming. For these reasons, widespread and intense ice-wedge thermokarst on Arctic hilltops and slopes contrast more muted responses to warming reported in low and subarctic environments. Increasing field evidence of thermokarst highlights the inherent climate sensitivity of the Arctic permafrost terrain and the need for integrated approaches to monitor change and investigate the cascade of environmental consequences.					; Lantz, Trevor/J-1163-2014	Fraser, Robert H/0000-0002-8055-4403; Lacelle, Denis/0000-0002-6691-8717; Lantz, Trevor/0000-0001-5643-1537; 														2072-4292				JUN	2018	10	6							954	10.3390/rs10060954	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10060954													WOS:000436561800148

Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera on Isle Royale National Park, USA, compared to mainland species pool and size distribution	ZOOKEYS												Extensive sampling for aquatic insects was conducted in the orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies) (EPT) of Isle Royale National Park (ISRO), Michigan, United States of America, during summer 2013. The island was ice covered until 8,000 to 10,000 years ago and is isolated by 22-70 km distance from the mainland. Two hypotheses were examined: that ISRO EPT richness would be much reduced from the mainland, and that the species colonizing ISRO would be of smaller size than mainland, adults presumably using updrafts to bridge the distance from mainland sources. Data sets were developed for known mainland EPT species and size for those species. The first hypothesis was confirmed with the mainland species pool consisting of 417 EPT, while ISRO is known to support 73 species. Richness of EPT is directly related to the number of specimens examined. Small streams supported five EPT species, while 15-25 species were found in larger streams. Lakeshores had intermediate diversity. The second hypothesis was substantiated for stoneflies, but not for mayflies or caddisflies. Stoneflies apparently are poorer fliers than either of the other two orders.						DeWalt, R.

J	Braaten, PJ; Guy, CS				Braaten, PJ; Guy, CS			Life history attributes of fishes along the latitudinal gradient of the Missouri river	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Populations of two short-lived species (emerald shiner Notropis atherinoides and sicklefin chub Macrhybopsis meeki) and three long-lived species (freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, river carpsucker Carpiodes carpio, and sauger Stizostedion canadense) were studied in the Missouri River to examine spatial variations in life history characteristics across a latitudinal and thermal gradient (38degrees47'N to 48degrees03'N). The life history characteristics included longevity (maximum age), the rate at which asymptotic length was approached (K from the von Bertalanffy growth equation), the mean back-calculated length at age, and growth rates during the first year of life (mm/degree-day and mm/d). The mean water temperature and number of days in the growing season averaged 1.3 times greater in the southern than in the northern latitudes, while degree-days averaged twice as great. The longevity of all species except freshwater drum increased significantly from south to north, but the relationships between maximum age and latitude were curvilinear for short-lived species and linear for long-lived species. The von Bertalanffy growth coefficient for river carpsuckers and saugers increased from north to south, as indicated by significant negative relationships between K and latitude. Mean back-calculated length at age was negatively related to latitude for freshwater drums (greater than or equal toage 4) and saugers (ages 1-5) but positively related to latitude for river carpsuckers (greater than or equal toage 6). One of the growth rates examined (mm/degree-day) increased significantly from low to high latitudes for emerald shiners, sicklefin chubs, freshwater drums, and river carpsuckers during the first growing season. The other growth rate (mm/d) increased significantly from low to high latitudes for emerald shiners but was inversely related to latitude for saugers. These results suggest that the thermal regime related to latitude influences the life history characteristics of fishes in the Missouri River.																			0002-8487					SEP	2002	131	5					931	945		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0931:LHAOFA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0931:LHAOFA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177740600010
J	Wang, S; Kang, WY				Wang, Shuang; Kang, Wanying			Symmetry breaking of rotating convection due to non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS												The non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects arising from variations in thermal expansivity are theoretically and numerically studied in the context of rotating Rayleigh-B & eacute;nard convection in forms of two-dimensional rolls. The thermal expansivity increases with pressure (depth), and its variation is measured by a dimensionless factor epsilon. Utilizing an asymptotic expansion with weak nonlinearity, we derive an amplitude equation, revealing that NOB effects amplify the magnitude of convection. An epsilon(2)-order NOB correction leads to a symmetry breaking about the horizontal mid-plane, manifested in the strengthening of convection near the bottom and its weakening near the top, forming bottom-heavy profiles. At epsilon(3)-order, the conjunction of NOB effects and nonlinear advection leads to a horizontal symmetry breaking. The values of Taylor number and Prandtl number determine whether upward or downward plumes are stronger. Numerical calculations validate the theoretical analyses in weakly nonlinear regime. This work advances our understanding of hydrothermal plumes in some winter lakes on Earth and in the subglacial oceans on icy moons as well as tracer transport from the seafloor to the ice shell.					; Wang, Shuang/AAJ-5631-2021; Kang, Wanying/E-8114-2016	Wang, Shuang/0000-0002-9406-1781; 													1070-6631	1089-7666				AUG	2024	36	8							087169	10.1063/5.0220662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0220662													WOS:001299494100006

The model applies a semi-empirical radiative transfer calculation to account for the interaction of the snow medium with microwaves; separate components are applied to account for vegetation, the atmosphere, and emission from the ground surface. For the retrieval of SWE, an innovative method is used to account for spatial and temporal variability in snow conditions by retrieving an effective parameter describing the scattering behavior of microwaves in the snow (a proxy indicator of the microwave effective snow grain size). In this study, the influence of differing snow conditions, as well as varying land cover, on the retrieved microwave effective snow grain size was analyzed. Passive microwave measurements were acquired using tower-based, mobile sled-based and airborne radiometers in a mixed forest environment near Sodankyla, Finland. Forward simulations at the tower site over an entire winter period showed that the use of an empirical relation to modify the classical in situ measured grain size produced HUT model bias errors less than 6 K on average at 19 and 37 GHz from a similar to 20-80 cm deep boreal snowpack. Model simulations for airborne and sled-based observations showed that using a simplified 2-layer representation of the snowpack improves simulation biases and RMSE, although modification of the measured grain size was again necessary to achieve these results, regardless of the layering configuration. The microwave effective grain size retrieved from HUT predictions was closely related to a simple average grain size measured in situ, both in terms of magnitude and temporal trend. This is an important finding as the retrieval scheme of Takala et al. (2011) relies on the microwave effective grain size to retain a degree of physical basis for values to be generally applicable over larger areas, which is challenging because this free parameter also accounts for errors unrelated to the effective snow grain size (i.e. vegetation, soil conditions, scene heterogeneity, etc.).

J	SCHLADOW, SG				SCHLADOW, SG			LAKE DESTRATIFICATION BY BUBBLE-PLUME SYSTEMS - DESIGN METHODOLOGY	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE												Thermal stratification during summer may result in lowered dissolved-oxygen levels below the thermocline of lakes and reservoirs. To avoid further deterioration of water quality, artificial destratification has long been practiced. This paper presents a totally new design methodology for the design of bubble-plume destratification systems. It is based on the interaction that occurs between a buoyant bubble plume and the density stratified water column through which it rises. Two dimensionless parameters, M and C, universally describe the behavior of such plumes. M represents the bubble source strength compared to the total pressure head, and C represents the effect of the stratification compared to the bubble source strength. By selecting appropriate values for these parameters, the individual bubble plumes can be designed to operate within high-efficiency bands. The number of such plumes that are required to destratify the lake can then be calculated by a simple energy balance. The method is validated using a combination of a dynamic reservoir simulation model (DYRESM) and a bubble-plume model. Comparison of the design recommendations with those produced from conventional practice suggest that large cost savings may be realized.																			0733-9429					MAR	1993	119	3					350	368		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1993)119:3(350)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1993)119:3(350)													WOS:A1993KN79100003

It is a convective hydrothermal system dominated by sodium chloride water and high boron content. The thermal springs mainly release CO2 and lower concentrations of H2S, H-2, and noble gases (He, Ne, and Ar). The aim of this study was to delimit the upflow areas in this geothermal system by determining the relationships between diffuse gas emission concentrations in soils and the zones of the greatest plausible permeability. Three sampling campaigns were carried out in 2018 (August and November) and 2019 (May). In these campaigns, diffuse gas emission in soils (CO2, Rn, and Hg vapors) and soil temperature were measured. The diffuse gas emission measurements ranged from 0.8 to 1,421 g m(-2)d(-1) for CO2 flux, from 0.49 to 2,914 ng/m(3) for gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), from 1,060 to 124,100 Bq/m(3) for Rn-222, and from 0 to 7,511 Bq/m(3) for Rn-220. The highest values were obtained in the dry season (May). Several anomalous zones of CO2 fluxes, GEM, and Rn-222 were found to match faults and lineaments, interpreted as the greatest permeability zones. The zone with the highest values of these three parameters was located in the so-called mud pool at the crossing of the Araro-Simirao fault with a NW-SE (south zone) lineament, which is associated with the upflow zone of the system. Other anomalous zones were located in fracture and/or lineament zones in the central and northern parts of the system, which are associated with the outflow zone.

Changes in infectious agent profiles and host gene expression during spawning migrations of adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												During spawning migrations, adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) must undergo a suite of morphological and physiological changes to prepare for spawning. Modern genomics approaches can be used to conduct nonlethal assessments of physiology and infectious agent presence in migrating salmon. We investigated gene expression changes and shifts in the prevalence and load of 18 infectious agents in the gill tissue of adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) during the final 50 km of their freshwater migration. We found 77% of fish successfully migrated to spawning grounds. Fish exhibited a decrease in thermal stress gene expression following lake migration, consistent with the hypothesized benefits of thermal refugia during spawning migrations. We also found evidence of cooler water selection (similar to 1.5 degrees C) during lake migration for fish with higher infection burden, suggesting behavioural changes for fish suffering higher infection burdens and potential benefits of thermal refuges for reducing the negative impacts of infection for migrating salmon. Collectively, our findings provide further evidence that fish behaviourally regulate exposure to stressful conditions such as high temperature that may undermine survival.					kelly, Lisa/GWU-9804-2022; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Liu, Shentan/T-1145-2019	Kelly, Lisa/0000-0003-2830-6493													0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	2023	80	8					1313	1334		10.1139/cjfas-2022-0132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2022-0132		MAY 2023											WOS:000993758700001

The aerobic degradation of the pollutants competes with the microbial respiration of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOC and POC). The fate of terrestrial POC (tPOC) in bank filtration is currently not fully understood. In the present study, fallen leaves of different local trees were milled, characterized and investigated as tPOC in both batch and column experiments. The respective contents of carbon and nitrogen differed slightly, but the different leaves released significantly different DOC fractions as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. While high molecular weight biopolymers were degraded by indigenous microorganisms, humic substances were not degraded within 96 days in batch experiments. DOC release and POC wash-out in column experiments led to a slight decrease of tPOC depositions, but more than 80% of the initial tPOC remained after 54 days thus representing a long-term organics reservoir for microbial respiration. The release of humic substances from autumnal leaf litter inputs is a plausible explanation for comparably high DOC concentrations (approximately 4.5 mg/L) in Berlin drinking water that mainly originates from lake bank filtration.

In this study, the diatom community structure and water quality of the epilimnion were analyzed in 38 lakes (40 sampling sites) in Wuhan City (central China) to assess the impacts of urbanization on lake ecosystems. Diatom communities displayed clear variation along the urban-to-rural gradient, with blooms of eutrophic species found in urban lakes in contrast to higher abundances of mesotrophic or oligotrophic taxa in rural lakes. Redundancy analyses revealed that the diatom community recognition to species, genus, and ecological guild level were all significantly correlated with Chl a, Si, and secchi depth, indicating that the changes in diatom communities were mainly explained by differences in nutrient concentrations and light condition. Considering the rapid urbanization and population expansion, it is important to carry out effective measures for the protection of these lake ecosystems, especially by reducing sewage discharge. The high consistency found between diatom community classification and water quality status highlights the applicability of diatoms for bioindication of shallow urban lakes, especially in rapidly developing cities. Even the taxonomic determination at the level of genera or ecological guilds can enable rapid water-quality assessment.					; Chen, Xu/A-7846-2015; Zeng, Linghan/LEM-9531-2024	Stevenson, Mark/0000-0002-8955-0855; Liang, Jia/0000-0002-3120-6664; Chen, Xu/0000-0002-8164-3088; 													1434-2944	1522-2632				JUN	2020	105	3-4					94	105		10.1002/iroh.201801953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201801953		JAN 2020											WOS:000508017500001

Growth Patterns of Roadside Torpedograss Populations within Xeric Florida Scrub	CASTANEA												Roads have the potential to serve as dispersal corridors for invasion into pristine habitats for invasive exotic species. However, undisturbed habitats may also resist such invasion. Torpedograss (Panicum repens L.) is an aggressive invasive grass in many parts of the world and, although most problematic in lakes and ponds, frequently occurs in roadsides and in other disturbed habitats. We studied torpedograss dynamics along roadsides adjacent to upland habitats in southcentral Florida to determine whether observed tiller population growth rates differed among roadside populations adjacent to different habitats. We also examined seasonal growth and persistence patterns of this invasive species in sand roads, quantifying torpedograss density, growth, and panicle production at 10 roadside sites every other month for 14 mo. Four populations were adjacent to disturbed habitats (pastures or disturbed Florida scrub) containing established populations of torpedograss, while six populations were adjacent to undisturbed Florida scrub lacking torpedograss. Population growth rates were negative in most roadsides neighboring undisturbed scrub, and positive when neighboring disturbed habitats. Tiller density, tiller height, and panicle production were all greatest in late summer, and tiller density increased with temperature and relative humidity. We observed no evidence of recruitment from seed. We never found any invasion of undisturbed Florida scrub, consistent with the hypothesis that undisturbed Florida scrub resists invasion. Results suggest that, in xeric habitats, land managers should give higher priority to restoring disturbed habitats or controlling expansion from disturbed habitat edges rather than to eradicating roadside populations of torpedograss.

GDGTs respond sensitively to environmental changes and have become an important tool in paleoenvironmental reconstruction. However, their application in speleothems, one of the most important archives of the study of past climates, has been quite limited. In this paper, we review the recent progress in the study of GDGTs in speleothems, from their sources to their distribution characteristics and paleoenvironmental applications. GDGTs in speleothems have been shown to come from dripping water, and cave systems. The distribution of GDGTs in speleothems shows that archaeal isoprenoid GDGTs (isoGDGTs) dominate over bacterial branched GDGTs (brGDGTs). The proxies based on isoGDGTs (TEX86) and brGDGTs (MBT/CBT) are correlated with temperature, which may offer promising potential methods for reconstructing terrestrial palaeotemperature. Ultimately, we discuss the difficulties and problems to be solved in studying speleothem GDGTs and the possible future directions for this field.

We verified the specimen was a Bigscale Logperch through genetic analysis. Review of published literature and the U.S. Geological Survey Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database suggests that this is the first known occurrence of Bigscale Logperch in Arizona. Further, three additional nonnative species were detected during our sampling events on June 21 and September 26, 2017-Smallmouth Buffalo Ictiobus bubalus, White Crappie Pomoxis annularis, and Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum-representing the first collection of these species in the Little Colorado River basin that we are aware of. We recommend further evaluation of the ecology, distribution, and abundance of these four nonnative species to better understand their effect on the native fishes of the watershed and the likelihood of establishment in the watershed and elsewhere in Arizona.					; Jackson, Zachary/T-1337-2019	Jackson, Zachary/0000-0003-3048-2541; 													1944-687X					DEC	2020	11	2					542	549		10.3996/JFWM-20-005	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/JFWM-20-005													WOS:000658726700015

Characterizing large-scale glaciotectonic sediment deformation using electrical resistivity methods	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING												Large-scale sediment deformation structures formed by glaciotectonic processes have been identified south of Ludington, USA. Here, several apparent clay diapirs rise from below beach level to near the top of an approximately 60 m high bluff along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Throughout the area, the surface topography and locations of springs indicate a complicated subsurface structure and a preferred pattern of groundwater drainage. Since public borehole information is sparse, it is not known whether the structures exposed in the bluff are true diapirs or ridges, and if the latter, what is their orientation. In this paper we present the results of field, laboratory, and modeling studies to characterize the inland extent and orientation of these deformation structures using galvanic-source electrical geophysical methods. We exploit the large electrical contrast between a sandy sedimentary layer and an underlying clayey silt sedimentary layer in which the deformation occurred. Constant-spread traverses and multi-electrode tomographic data demonstrate that at least one of the narrow structures extends a significant distance inland.					van Dam, Remke/A-2319-2011	van Dam, Remke/0000-0003-4946-9734; Nowicki Jessee, Martha Anna/0000-0001-8076-7647													1742-2132	1742-2140				APR	2016	13	2					S39	S49		10.1088/1742-2132/13/2/S39	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-2132/13/2/S39													WOS:000376496500006

Significant food preferences were demonstrated between species and between lakes. Chironomid pupae dominated the macroinvertebrate diet of perch, roach, site predominantly either Spirogyra sp. (St Peters Lake) or Daphnia hyalina (Main Lake). The Main Lake, bream fed largely upon chironomid larvae and the bivalve Sphaerium but in St Peters Lake they positively selected a variety of less abundant benthic invertebrate taxa. Bream switched from benthos to zooplankton in the Main Lake in 1986. Tench ate large numbers of Asellus and showed positive selection of various macroinvertebrate prey in St Peters but ate D. hyalina in Main Lake. Tropic overlap for chironomids and other macroinvertebrate prey was demonstrated between perch, beam and tench, and potentially with wildfowl which used the gravel pits for breeding and wintering.					, Ros/JXX-3284-2024															1095-8649				DEC	1990	37	6					945	957		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1990.tb03598.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1990.tb03598.x													WOS:A1990EM57800012
J	Watras, CJ; Hanson, PC				Watras, Carl J.; Hanson, Paul C.			Ecohydrology of two northern Wisconsin bogs	ECOHYDROLOGY												The dynamics of water and solutes were investigated in two northern bog ponds using sensor networks and discrete water samples. Embedded sensors monitored water level (S), precipitation (P), evaporation (E), water temperature (T) and specific conductivity (SC) in the peatlands and encircled ponds at 30 min time intervals from 2009 to 2015. Pond water chemistry was monitored seasonally from 2000 to 2020. Daily hydrographs and water budgets indicated that both bogs are ombrotrophic systems, perched above the local water table. Although the predominant flowpath for liquid water was precipitation -> pond -> peatland -> underlying glacial deposits, evaporation accounted for 70% to 90% of water losses. High dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ponds resulted from transient reversals of flowpath and from molecular diffusion across the peatland/pond interface (a tea bag effect). DOM of peatland origin dominated pond water chemistry, regulating the concentration of important metals, major nutrients and the acid-base status of both bog ponds. Elevated concentrations of Fe, Hg and MeHg in the ponds reflected ligand binding by DOM. The formation of DOM-Fe-PO4 complexes likely accounted for >3-fold higher P concentration relative to nearby clearwater lakes. Linear regression of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) against the anion deficit indicated that DOM contributed up to 6.6 mEq of strong acid per gramme carbon in pond waters. Winter maxima in the seasonal cycles of DOC, Ca, Mg, N, P, Hg and MeHg in both bog ponds were attributable, in large part, to salting out during ice formation. We conclude that multiple methods are needed to understand the dynamics of water and solutes in bog ecosystems.

Introduced alien ringed crayfish (Orconectes neglectus neglectus [Faxon, 1885]) threaten imperiled coldwater crayfish (Orconectes eupunctus Williams, 1952) in the Eleven Point River drainage, Missouri, USA	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The Eleven Point River drainage in the Ozarks ecoregion of North America contains the largest known populations of and critical habitat for the globally imperiled coldwater crayfish (Orconectes eupunctus). We present here the discovery of an introduced population of alien ringed crayfish (Orconectes neglectus neglectus) in Jolliff Spring Branch in the upper reaches of the drainage. Sampling was conducted at eight sites throughout the tributary to determine the extent of the alien species' range in the stream. Orconectes n. neglectus were found at four sites extending along 3.4 km of stream, with reproducing populations confirmed at two upstream sites, and few individuals found at two others. This invasion represents a threat to O. eupunctus, which occurs a few kilometers further downstream in the drainage and has been recorded from only the lower reaches of Barren Fork and throughout the mainstem Eleven Point River. Introduced O. neglectus were previously associated with localized extirpation of O. eupunctus in another drainage. Study results warrant monitoring of the invasion and possible reassessment of the conservation status for O. eupunctus.																			1798-6540					MAR	2012	7	1			SI		129	134		10.3391/ai.2012.7.1.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2012.7.1.014													WOS:000306278200014
J	Sonntag, B; Sommaruga, R				Sonntag, Bettina; Sommaruga, Ruben			Effectiveness of Photoprotective Strategies in Three Mixotrophic Planktonic Ciliate Species	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Mixotrophic ciliate assemblages often prevail in summer in the surface layers of lakes. During this time, they are potentially exposed to damaging levels of incident solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and need efficient photoprotective mechanisms to minimize the damage. Herein, we tested the algal-bearing species ofPelagodileptus trachelioides,Stokesia vernalis,andVorticella chlorellatafor how they handled stress under exposure to the artificial sunlight spectrum (i.e., UV treatment), just photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), or in the dark (i.e., control). In addition to measurements of their survival, changes in behavior, shape, and whether dark or photoenzymatic repair (PER) mechanisms are present, we measured the concentration of UV-absorbing compounds (i.e., mycosporine-like amino acids). In contrast to the response in the PAR and dark treatments, sublethal effects were observed in all species when exposed to UVR. A wavelength-specific test forP. trachelioidesrevealed that UV-B was especially lethal. These results suggest that the photoprotective mechanisms found in these ciliates are not sufficient to allow for their survival directly at the surface and that, accordingly, they need to shift their position further down in the water column.

The study area is the Lake Karla basin in Thessaly, Central Greece. Meteorological data from the archive of Center for Research and Technology, Thessaly (CERETETH) have also been used. The methodology was developed using satellite and ground data for the period of summer 2007. Landsat and MODIS imagery were combined in order to have data with high temporal and spatial resolution (downscaling). The downscaling technique applied is the output downscaling with regression between images. This technique disaggregates imagery by applying linear regression between two MODIS products to the previous or subsequent Landsat product. After the calculation of a first order linear regression between two MODIS-derived ETa maps the next step is the regression to the ETa map derived from the prior Landsat image to predict the disaggregated subsequent Landsat ETa map. The results are satisfactory, giving the general trend of ETa derived from the original SEBAL procedure.					; Spiliotopoulos, Marios/S-9367-2019	LOUKAS, ATHANASIOS/0000-0001-7597-9805; 													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9638-6				2013	8795								879508	10.1117/12.2027536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2027536													WOS:000325475000008
J	Zhao, YF; Zhang, W; Zhang, WH				Zhao, Yifan; Zhang, Wei; Zhang, Weihua			Phosphorus transport process and driving mechanism in the sediment of farm ponds in small watersheds of three Gorges Reservoir area	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The water quality health of the farm ponds in the small watersheds of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area is critical to maintaining agricultural productivity. The main challenge in managing the water quality is predicting and controlling the release of total phosphorus (TP) from endogenous pollution in the substrate. Numerous studies have shown that endogenous pollution release from large water bodies like lakes is influenced by factors such as temperature and pH. However, knowledge about the response mechanisms in smaller water bodies, such as farm ponds, is still lacking. This study focuses on TP, using indoor simulation tests and orthogonal tests to investigate the transport and transformation of TP in four representative farm ponds located in Ruxi Town, at the heart of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. Results showed that seasonal variations led to temperature changes thereby significantly affect TP release, with the highest release rates occurring in summer when the temperature was highest. The farm ponds demonstrated a significant annual cycle in phosphorus source-sink dynamics. Furthermore, factors including pH and water depth influenced the release rates; acidic conditions promoted phosphorus release from the substrate more effectively than alkaline conditions. Additionally, disturbances at lower intensities were observed to inhibit TP release. Building on these findings, this study further explored the advantages and limitations of using multiple regression analysis and BP Neural Network models for modeling phosphorus release and predicting annual TP release. Ultimately, the study proposes measures to reduce and control endogenous pollution, laying a foundation for managing eutrophication and protecting aquatic health in farm ponds.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2024	169								112787	10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112787		NOV 2024											WOS:001356245200001
J	Fukumoto, J; Herrero, S				Fukumoto, J; Herrero, S			Observations of the Long-Toed Salamander, Ambystoma macrodactylum, in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The ecology of the Long-Toed Salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) was studied in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, and evidence of its presence was obtained at nine of thirteen study sites. Populations occurred throughout the park at elevations from 1280 to 1930 metres in habitat that varied from aspen parkland to subalpine forest. Salamander breeding activity occurred from early April to late June, depending on location. Development of larvae in lakes or ponds is usually completed in one season (i.e., during one summer); however, two-season development was indicated at Summit Lake (elevation 1930 m). Mark-recapture data were obtained at Linnet Lake by conducting night searches and utilizing drift fencing and pitfall traps. A Schumacher-Eschmeyer estimate of between 3274 and 4690 breeding adults (95% confidence interval) was obtained for the population. Human impacts included roadway mortality and alteration of habitat due to local contamination and/or global effects. The total count of salamander roadway mortalities near Linnet Lake in 1994 was equal to 1.4 to 2.0% of the estimated population of breeding adults. Roadway mortality also may have contributed to the unusual female biased 3:1 (464 females:155 males) sex ratio obtained for this population. Measurements of pH taken at several aquatic breeding sites indicated a decrease in pH of 1 to 2 1/2 units had occurred in the last twenty-five years; the change may pose a potential threat to salamanders. Acid precipitation may be the source of this change.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	1998	112	4					579	585																WOS:000079733000001

The Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) method is used to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological processes in the watershed. Additionally, the grey relational analysis method is employed to explore key indicators affecting the ecological effects of fish. New hydrological insights for the region: The streamflow of the Yangtze River mainstem and its seven tributaries increases as the distance from the river mouth decreases. The degree of hydrological changes in various basins is moderate (33-66%). Except for the Jialing River, Wu River, and Poyang Lake, the streamflow changes in other basins are mainly influenced by human activities. Among them, Yichang is most affected by human activities (75.43%), while Wu River is most affected by climate change (67.05%). The rate of land use development has reached 116.9% over the past 20 years, and vegetation coverage has been increasing at a linear rate of 0.003 per year, Summer rainfall is significantly positively correlated with flow, while temperature is significantly negatively correlated.

Here we calibrate a new organic geochemical proxy for lake temperature, and present a 45-yr-resolution temperature record from Hurleg Lake at the eastern margin of the ACA in the northern Tibetan Plateau. Combination with other proxy data from the same samples reveals a distinct warm-dry climate association throughout the record, which contrasts with the warm-wet association found in the Asian monsoon region. This indicates that the climatic boundary between the westerly and the monsoon regimes has remained roughly in the same place throughout the Holocene, at least near our study site. Six millennial-scale cold events are found within the past 9000 yr, which approximately coincide with previously documented events of northern high-latitude cooling and tropical drought. This suggests a connection between the North Atlantic and tropical monsoon climate systems, via the westerly circulation. Finally, we also observe an increase in regional climate variability after the mid-Holocene, which we relate to changes in vegetation (forest) cover in the monsoon region through a land-surface albedo feedback.

Concentrations of total Hg (Hg-T) in streamwater draining the wetland showed little temporal variation, The annual areal watershed flux of Hg-T (2.2 mu g/m(2)-yr) was considerably smaller than regional inputs of atmospheric deposition of Hg-T, indicating that the terrestrial environment is a net sink for atmospheric deposition of Hg-T. Drainage inputs of Hg-T were conservatively transported through the beaver impoundment. The annual flux of total methylmercury (CH3HgT+) was greater than literature values of atmospheric deposition suggesting that the watershed is a net source of CH3HgT+. Stream concentrations of CH3HgT+ increased during low-flow summer conditions in a riparian wetland, and particularly at the outlet of the beaver impoundment. Net production of CH3HgT+ occurred in the beaver impoundment (0.45 mu g/m(2)-yr). Rates of net methylation for the beaver impoundment were comparable to values reported in the literature for wetlands.

We assembled the model from a regional 2D seismic reflection line integrated with potential gravimetric field data and a local 3D seismic reflection volume integrated with well data (lithologies and in situ stress). (i) The geochemical isotope range of delta C-13(CO2) falls mostly within -7 parts per thousand and -5 parts per thousand and shows relatively high values for He-3/He-4 represented by an R/Ra rate of up to 5.60, indicating CO2 mantle generation and degassing. (ii) Seismic interpretation feasibly validated by potential gravimetric responses of the crustal structure (Moho discontinuity) show CO2 migration through deep-seated faults in a region of highly stretched continental crust with oceanward mantle uprising. (iii) Early Cretaceous basement highs generated in an obliquely syn-rift faulting system control CO2 accumulation in thermogenic travertines (hydrothermal carbonate reservoirs of continental lakes), and Aptian evaporites subsequently trap it.

Water-Quality Improvement of an Agricultural Watershed Marsh After Macrophyte Establishment and Point-Source Reduction	WETLANDS												Green Lake, located in central Wisconsin USA within a watershed with land use dominated by agriculture, is listed as impaired under Sect. 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. The primary tributary, Silver Creek, is also impaired because of high total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. Silver Creek flows through a shallow marsh before reaching the lake. Prior to 2006, the marsh was turbid and free of macrophytes. Efforts to restrict carp (Cyprinus carpio) in the marsh and reduce the primary upstream phosphorus point source, resulted in the marsh becoming a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated system. The point source reduction and marsh phytoplankton-to-macrophyte shift reduced the export of TP and suspended sediment (SS). These measured reductions at the marsh outlet exceeded the documented reductions in the upstream point source suggesting that the shift to a macrophyte-dominated system drove part of the TP reductions. TP loads at the marsh outlet significantly decreased in all seasons; however, SS loads significantly decreased in all seasons except winter, suggesting the vegetation shift was an important driver for these reductions. During 2012-2017, the marsh served as an overall sink for TP and SS, retaining on average 1.59 kg/day and 0.95 MT/day, respectively. Overall, this study documents benefits of a multi-stakeholder, collaborative ecological effort to restore a marsh from a turbid system to a macrophyte-dominated system, which resulted in significant reductions in downstream TP and SS loading to a major inland lake. This effort may serve as a model for similar restorations in other watersheds with land use dominated by agriculture.

Specific goals were to: 1) address the challenges of monitoring the surface thermal characteristics of the >10.000 spatially and temporally dynamic thermal features in the Park (including hot springs, pools, geysers, fumaroles, and mud pots) that are spread out over similar to 5000 km(2), by using satellite TIR remote sensing tools (e.g., ASTER and MODIS), 2) to estimate the radiant geothermal heat flux (GHF) for Yellowstone's thermal areas, and 3) to identify normal, background thermal changes so that significant, abnormal changes can be recognized, should they ever occur (e.g., changes related to tectonic, hydrothermal, impending volcanic processes, or human activities, such as nearby geothermal development). ASTER TIR data (90-m pixels) were used to estimate the radiant GHF from all of Yellowstone's thermal features and update maps of thermal areas. MODIS TIR data (1-km pixels) were used to record background thermal radiance variations from March 2000 through December 2010 and establish thermal change detection limits. A lower limit for the radiant GHF estimated from ASTER TIR temperature data was established at similar to 2.0 GW, which is similar to 30-45% of the heat flux estimated through geochemical thermometry. Also, about 5 km(2) of thermal areas was added to the geodatabase of mapped thermal areas. A decade-long time-series of MODIS TIR radiance data was dominated by seasonal cycles. A background subtraction technique was used in an attempt to isolate variations due to geothermal changes. Several statistically significant perturbations were noted in the time-series from Norris Geyser Basin, however many of these did not correspond to documented thermal disturbances. This study provides concrete examples of the strengths and limitations of current satellite TIR monitoring of geothermal areas, highlighting some specific areas that can be improved. This work provides a framework for future satellite-based thermal monitoring at Yellowstone and other volcanic and geothermal systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The rapid urbanization process significantly affects meteorological air temperatures and relative humidity in urban and rural areas. Therefore, this study investigates the spatiotemporal evolution of heat waves (HWs) based on the wet-bulb temperature (TW) and urbanization effects. The results indicated that (1) the annual maximum TW exhibiting a significant decreasing trend is distributed in the Yangtze River valley and Lake Taihu Basin. The number of HW days showed a significant decrease during both 1980-1999 and 2000-2009. (2) The HW characteristics showed an insig-nificant decreasing trend in the Yangtze River valley, while it showed an insignificant increasing trend in the YRD. Further, the HW duration, intensity, and peak values showed significant upward trends in the coastal areas of the YRD urban agglomeration. (3) The proportion of HW duration increased from 28% in 1962-1990 to 55% in 1991-2019. The contribution of urbanization to the duration of the high-temperature HWs was 47.8%. Moreover, the impact of urbanization on HWs increased after 1990. (4) Although urban areas had a higher probability of extreme temperatures during 1991-2019, decreases in relative humidity have caused a decreasing trend of HW occurrence. Further, urban with low RH on the HW in urban areas were lower than those in rural and suburban areas. This research provides important evidence and recommendations for assessing the impact of heat waves related to urbanization.

Some research has been conducted to assess the environmental distribution and risk level of antibiotics, but their distribution remains largely uncharacterized. Thus, this study investigated the distribution and abundance of 39 antibiotics belonging to five groups, and their associated risks in surface water around Luoma Lake in the north of Jiangsu province, China. Nineteen antibiotics were detected, at a detection frequency (DF) ranging from 2.27% to 100%. The total antibiotics (Sigma ABs) concentrations ranged from 34.91 to 825.93 ng/L, with a median concentration of 195.45 ng/L. Among these antibiotics, chlortetracycline (DF: 100%; median: 172.02 ng/L) was the dominant antibiotic, accounting for a median percentage of 91.0% of Sigma ABs concentrations. Spearman rank correlation method found a significant correlation between clindamycin (DF: 72.7%; median: 2.01 ng/L) and lincomycin (DF: 79.5%; median: 4.58 ng/L). The ecological risk quotient (RQ) values for two out of 44 sampling sites were higher than 1, indicating a high risk; 11.4% of the RQ values fell between 0.1 and 1, indicating a medium risk. Moreover, roxithromycin was found to be the dominant contributor to the ecological risk, accounting for a median of 79.7% of SABs. However, the total non-carcinogenic (<6.54 x 10(-4)) and carcinogenic risks (<1.64 x 10(-7)) of SABs were negligible at the detected concentrations.

In this study, vegetation cover as a function of July temperatures was modelled for the Dividalen valley area situated in the northern Scandinavian Mountains. Site-specific pollen deposition values of the two dominating tree species pine and birch were simulated and compared with empirical fossil pollen values. The applied vegetation model could not explain the forest dynamics prior to 7400cal. BP, although after this date, the forest seemed to have received a modern structure, and summer temperatures could potentially explain the long-term variations in forest cover. The most extensive forest cover occurred c. 7400-3800cal. BP, corresponding to July temperatures of 0.5-1 degrees C above the present. The approach proved sensitive to both site location and data quality. Careful site-selection is of importance for the application, and pollen accumulation rates are to be preferred as pollen percentage values proved problematic.

Effects of Tornado Disturbance on Bat Communities in Southern Illinois	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												On 6 May 2003, a tornado severely damaged 284 ha of Mermet Lake State Forest and Wildlife Area in southern Illinois. We used mist nets and Anabat ultrasonic detectors to determine if community composition and habitat use of bats differed between the tornado-disturbed forest and surrounding undisturbed forest during the summers of 2004 and 2005. Ten species of bats (118 individuals) were caught using mist nets on sites in undisturbed forest; 4 species (I I individuals) were mist-netted on disturbed sites (chi(2) = 34.24, df = 1, P < 0.0001). The Anabat system documented six species on both habitat types with no difference in the number of bat passes detected acoustically. We suspect that apparent differences in mist-net data reflect the greater ability of bats on the disturbed sites to avoid nets. Telemetry data and field observations confirmed bats used disturbed and undisturbed areas for roosting and foraging. Unless precluded by higher fire danger, we suggest that tornado-disturbed areas remain non-salvaged because they provide additional roosting and foraging habitat for many bat species.																			1092-6194	1938-5307					2009	16	4					553	562		10.1656/045.016.n405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.016.n405													WOS:000273107500005

In the 11 different species examined, total PCBs concentrations were in the range of 11-4500 ng/g (wet wt). IUPAC 105, 118, 138, 153, and 180 were the predominant congeners in almost all the birds. White-cheeked tern collected from India and common tern collected from Lake Baikal showed high PCBs concentrations of 4400 ng/g (wet wt) and 4500 ng/g (wet wt), respectively, and accumulated relatively high ratios of penta-CBs (IUPAC 118, 105, 99). Toxic equivalents (TEQs) of non- and mono-ortho PCB congeners in birds collected from India and Lake Baikal were in the range of 1.5-56 and 2.8-370 pg/g wet wt, respectively. Toxic assessment results led by calculated TEQs of the transfer to eggs from female birds revealed that TEQs in most of migratory and resident birds were comparable to the lowest observable effect level (LOAEL) of chicken which is a highly sensitive species against dioxin-like compounds. Calculated transfer TEQs to eggs of common tern collected from Lake Baikal in autumn, however, exceeded the LOAEL of CYP1A induction in bald eagle embryos and ED50 of that in pheasant embryos, suggesting that embryo toxicity by coplanar PCBs in some avian species breeding in Lake Baikal is possible.

Concurrent with inhibition of primary production, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibited NO3- assimilation. Nitrate up to 1 mg of N/l did not affect the rate of primary production during 3 h of incubation. The NO3- fertilizer added to the lake weekly was consumed through algal assimilation in about 3 days. Excretion of the photoassimilated NO3- as dissolved organic N represented a significant portion of the nutrient incorporated by the cells. Only 40% of the NO3--15N which disappeared could be accounted for in the particulate fraction. Although the rest was presumably excreted, only 15% of the 15N label was accounted for as cationic dissolved organic N by isotope assays. These excreted organic forms were predominantly serine and glycine in the dissolved free amino acid fraction. Bacteria as well as algae might be expected to contribute to and modify the extracellular N pool.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1978	35	6					1052	1060		10.1128/AEM.35.6.1052-1060.1978	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.35.6.1052-1060.1978								677872					WOS:A1978FD00500010

Sediment dredging efficiently removes P-rich sediments from shallow-water eutrophic lakes. However, studies on the effects of sediment dredging on the internal P loading of aquacultural lakes are still lacking. Moreover, the migration and transformation processes of labile P and the mechanisms of sediment P release are unclear. To evaluate dredging effectiveness, we employed two in situ high-resolution sampling techniques to simultaneously measure sediment labile P and porewater soluble reactive P (SRP) and Fe (II) at the millimeter scale. Dredging effectively reduced surface sediment Ca-P contents and organic matter (OM) below the sediment-water interface (SWI). Moreover, dredging decreased the SRP diffusion flux across the SWI in summer. After dredging, Fe-P (P bound to Fe, Al, and Mn oxides and hydroxides) and OP (organic P) contents increased by 136% and 48% in the newly formed deposited layer (140 mm thick), respectively. The increased bioavailable P content significantly enhanced the capability of sediment solids to resupply labile P to porewater SRP. The stronger positive correlation between porewater soluble Fe (II) and SRP suggests that Fe redox cycling regulated internal P release. Our results suggest that dredging effectiveness will weaken over time due to the re-deposition of active P. which in turn increases the risk of sediment P release. To curb the release of sediment P. we recommend the implementation of additional in situ restoration techniques that improve the oxide layer of surface sediments and reduce sediment suspension.

J	Kipp, R; Ricciardi, A				Kipp, Rebekah; Ricciardi, Anthony			Impacts of the Eurasian round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) on benthic communities in the upper St. Lawrence River	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												An invasive benthivorous fish, the Eurasian round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is abundant throughout the lower Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River system. We examined the round goby's potential to alter benthic communities on cobble substrates in the upper St. Lawrence River. During the summers of 2008 and 2009, macroinvertebrates and benthic algae were sampled across sites with varying goby densities. Archived data from various sites in 2004-2006 (prior to invasion) were available for comparison. Macroinvertebrate community composition varied significantly among samples grouped into categories based on goby density and time since invasion. Macroinvertebrate diversity and dominance by large-bodied taxa declined with increasing goby density. Surprisingly, dreissenid biomass did not vary consistently with goby density, in contrast to studies in the Great Lakes. The biomass of all non-dreissenid taxa was negatively correlated with increasing goby density across sites and over time at three of four sites. Negative effects were most pronounced on the biomass of gastropods. Benthic algal biomass increased with goby density across sites, suggesting a trophic cascade driven by the impacts of gobies on gastropods and other algivores. Our study highlights the potential ecosystem impacts of an expanding goby population in a large river.

J	Taylor, GC; Weyl, OLF				Taylor, G. C.; Weyl, O. L. F.			Validation of annulus formation in otoliths of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides outside their native range	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The periodicity of growth zone formation was validated for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides using edge analysis (EA) and mark recapture of chemically-tagged wild fish (MRCT) to test the hypothesis that one opaque and hyaline zone was deposited annually in sagittal otoliths sampled from temperate South African M.salmoides populations. For 35 fish recaptured in the MRCT experiment, the relationship between the number of growth zones posterior to the chemical mark and the time at liberty (0.041.38years) did not differ significantly from a 1:1 relationship (t-test, t=0.76, d.f.=2,33, P=0.45). This result was supported by EA, where periodic logistic regression and a binomial model linked with a von Mises distribution for circular data demonstrated that the frequency of otoliths with opaque margins followed a unimodal distribution (maximum OctoberJanuary). Both the timing of growth zone deposition (spring) and the annual rate were consistent with results from validation studies conducted globally in localities ranging from 45 degrees N to 33 degrees S, and indicate that the growth zone deposition rate is annual throughout the native and introduced range of this species.

J	Kim, JP; Rochford, T				Kim, Jonathan P.; Rochford, Timothy			Methyl mercury in brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Arahura River, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations were determined in brown trout (Salmo trutta) from the Arahura River, on the West Coast of the South Island. New Zealand. Trout fell into two groups, one with very low MeHg concentrations (0.002-0.018 mu g g(-1)) and the other with relatively higher MeHg concentrations (0.096-0.220 mu g g(-1)). Trout elevated in MeHg, had a terrestrial carbon signature and fed at a higher trophic level than trout with low MeHg concentrations. The strontium:calcium ratio in the otoliths of two fish revealed that a trout with low MeHg values had lived in the sea for part of its life. whereas a trout with higher MeHg concentration had lived solely in the river. Sea-running trout were eating prey of marine origin, whereas the river-resident fish were consuming prey at a higher trophic level in the food web, which may result in markedly different MeHg concentrations in these fish.																			0028-8330	1175-8805				SEP	2008	42	3					271	276		10.1080/00288330809509954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330809509954													WOS:000261136700001

Rising temperatures, especially when combined with widespread nutrient pollution, directly favour the growth of toxic cyanobacteria. Climate changes have also altered natural water level fluctuations increasing the probability of extreme events as dry periods followed by heavy rains. The massive appearance of Dolichospermum lemmermannii (= planktonic Anabaena), a toxic species absent from the pelagic zone of the subalpine oligotrophic Lake Maggiore before 2005, could be a consequence of the unusual fluctuations of lake level in recent years. We hypothesized that these fluctuations may favour the cyanobacterium as result of nutrient pulses from the biofilms formed in the littoral zone when the lake level is high. To help verify this, we exposed artificial substrates in the lake, and evaluated their nutrient enrichment and release after desiccation, together with measurements of fluctuations in lake level, precipitation and D.lemmermannii population. The highest percentage of P release and the lowest C:P molar ratio of released nutrients coincided with the summer appearance of the D.lemmermannii bloom. The P pulse indicates that fluctuations in level counteract nutrient limitation in this lake and it is suggested that this may apply more widely to other oligotrophic lakes. In view of the predicted increase in water level fluctuations due to climate change, it is important to try to minimize such fluctuations in order to mitigate the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms.

J	Sun, Z; Huang, ZR; Ji, KJ; Wang, MD; Hou, JZ				Sun, Zhe; Huang, Zirui; Ji, Kejia; Wang, Mingda; Hou, Juzhi			Alternating influences of the Westerlies and Indian Summer Monsoon on the hydroclimate of the source region of the Yarlung Tsangpo over past 4000 yr	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE												The Yarlung Tsangpo, the longest river in the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP), has attracted much research attention aimed at understanding the factors controlling its modern hydrology and possible future discharge in the context of ongoing climate change. However, partly due to the complex regional climatic background, no consistent conclusions have been reached, especially for its upper reaches. Paleohydrological reconstructions of the source region of the Yarlung Tsangpo can potentially improve our understanding of the history of humidity and its response to climatic variability. In this study, we used a 97 cm gravity core from Gongzhu Co to reconstruct the hydrology change during the late Holocene. The core was dated using AMS 14C and Pb/Cs methods, and we used measurements of element contents (determined by high-resolution XRF scanning), grain size, IC/TOC, and magnetic susceptibility to reconstruct hydroclimatic changes in the source of the Yarlung Tsangpo watershed since similar to 4000 yr ago. Combined with a modern meteorological data set, we found that PC1 of the XRF data, the Ca/(Fe + Ti) ratio, and EM1 of the grain size data were indicative of changes in humidity. Our records demonstrate a wet interval during similar to 4-1.7 ka BP (ka = 1000 yr, BP represents years before 1950 AD), followed by a dry period during since similar to 1 ka BP. Comparison with independent regional paleoclimatic records revealed shifts in the dominant factors controlling humidity. The wet interval during similar to 4-1.7 ka BP was coeval with a strengthened Westerlies, implying a dominant moisture supply from northern high latitudes. However, the extremely low values of Ca/(Fe + Ti) ratio during similar to 4-2.5 ka BP indicate potential glacial freshwater source, which is corroborated by the concurrent high magnetic susceptibility values and increased grain size. The rapid drying trend during similar to 1.7-1 ka BP suggests a switch in moisture supply from the Westerlies to the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). We attribute the drought conditions after similar to 1 ka BP to a weakened ISM, although a Westerlies influence and the potential effect of high temperatures on evaporation cannot be excluded. We suggest that future hydroclimatic research in this region should attempt to distinguish the individual moisture contributions of the ISM and the Westerlies during the last millennium.

J	Iturrizaga, L				Iturrizaga, L			New observations on present and prehistorical glacier-dammed lakes in the Shimshal valley (Karakoram Mountains)	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												In the upper Shimshal valley three glacier dams are present along a horizontal distance of only 25 km: the Khurdopin/Yukshin Gardan, Yazghil and Malungutti glaciers. Only a few decameters separate the glacier tongues from the opposite valley flanks. At some localities the drainage of the main river already takes place subglacially. About 20 glacial floods occurred in the last century in the Shimshal valley, some of them with devastating consequences. The erosion potential is clearly visible by the high loss of settlement areas of the villages Shimshal (3080 m) and Pasu (2450 m). In the past, the lake formation was mainly attributed to the Khurdopin dam. New field observations in summer 2001 revealed that advances of the Yukshin Gardan glacier can also contribute to a blockade of the Shimshal river. Slightest snow line depressions already would lead to numerous stable glacier dams and therefore to long-lasting ice-dammed lakes. Such a situation occurred during Neoglacial times, if not even during the Little Ice Age. Huge sequences of lake sediments, several decameters in height, evidence the prehistorical glacial lake ponding in the Karakoram valleys. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hillman, AL; Abbott, MB; Yu, JQ				Hillman, Aubrey L.; Abbott, Mark B.; Yu, JunQing			Climate and anthropogenic controls on the carbon cycle of Xingyun Lake, China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The organic and inorganic carbon cycles in lakes are responsive to both natural climate variability and human induced environmental changes. Here we present an 8600-year sediment record from Xingyun Lake in Yunnan, China that provides insight into carbon cycling and lake primary productivity using stable isotope measurements of organic carbon and nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio, inorganic carbon isotopes, and mass accumulation rates of carbon, nitrogen, and calcite. The early to middle Holocene is characterized by relative stability in most proxies although some variation in organic carbon isotopes reflects fluctuating terrestrial organic matter inputs. The middle to late Holocene, from 5300 to 3300 years BP, is marked by amplified variability in nearly all proxies and suggests either increased C4 vegetation or increased primary productivity. These changes are coincident with declining lake levels and increased aridity throughout the Indian Summer Monsoon region. After 3300 years BP, the greatest variability is in nitrogen isotopes and coincides closely with human settlement in the region. These changes are accompanied by further indications of increased primary productivity, suggesting eutrophic lake conditions. While we cannot definitively link human activity to these changes, the balance of evidence suggests that other mechanisms are unlikely. This study supports previous work that anthropogenic activities began measurably impacting the landscape in southwestern China within the last few millennia.

J	Fahrner, S; Radke, M; Karger, D; Blodau, C				Fahrner, Sven; Radke, Michael; Karger, Dorothee; Blodau, Christian			Organic matter mineralisation in the hypolimnion of an eutrophic Maar lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Constraints on hypolimnetic methane production in productive lakes are of interest owing to the importance of methane emissions from lakes for the atmospheric methane burden. We studied carbon fluxes and terminal electron accepting processes in the hypolimnion of eutrophic Meerfelder Maar, Germany. Carbon fluxes from epilimnion and sediments were estimated using sediment traps, porewater analysis and incubation techniques. The contribution of various redox processes to overall dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production was quantified from a seasonal hypolimnetic mass balance. Carbon sedimentation rates were 22 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from the epilimnion and 20-34 mmol m(-2) d(-1) from the hypolimnion. Anaerobic respiration accounted for a DIC production of 21 mmol m(-2) d(-1), and was thus capable of using a substantial part of primary production. The diffusive C flux from the sediment was small in comparison, although potential respiration rates in incubation experiments reached 63 - 75 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Ebullition of methane occurred, but could not be quantified. Following depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate, iron and sulphate reduction and methanogenesis proceeded concurrently in the hypolimnion. Estimated hypolimnetic DIC production decreased in the order methanogenesis (2267 mmol m(-2)) > oxic respiration (880 mmol m(-2)) > sulphate reduction (575mmolm(-2)) > denitrification (159 mmol m(-2)) > acetogenesis (157 mmol m(-2)) > iron reduction (19 - 144 mmol m(-2)). Methane production thus dominated respiration and was not inhibited by sulphate and iron reduction. It also strongly accelerated with increased carbon sedimentation rates in September, which apparently eased limiting factors on the process. Hypolimnetic methane production is thus likely an important process in similar lakes, even in the presence of other electron acceptors, and will contribute to methane emissions during fall turnover.					; Radke, Michael/A-5198-2008	Fahrner, Sven/0000-0001-6240-9678; Radke, Michael/0000-0001-6651-490X													1015-1621	1420-9055				AUG	2008	70	3					225	237		10.1007/s00027-008-8008-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-008-8008-2													WOS:000258704000002

To address this need, underwater photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), optical parameters and concentrations of three optically active substances, tripton (non-phytoplankton particulate matter), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were measured at 67 sites in Lake Taihu, a large shallow lake in China in October 2004. The spatial variation of optically active substances and their relative contributions to the underwater light climate were determined. The PAR diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(PAR) at different sites varied between 0.87 and 12.43 m(-1), with a mean of 4.42 m(-1). Significant spatial differences were found for optically active substances and PAR attenuation, with low concentrations and weak light attenuation in macrophyte-dominated bays such as East Lake Taihu, Xukou Bay and Gongshan Bay, and high concentrations and strong light attenuation in the open water and algae-dominated areas such as the center of the lake, southwestern region, and Meiliang Bay. The mean relative contributions of tripton, Chl-a, and CDOM to light attenuation were 82.6 %, 9.7 %, and 6.8 % of K-d(PAR), respectively. Tripton was the dominant constituent of K-d(PAR), and mean of 97.5 % of the variation in K-d(PAR) could be explained by tripton. In autumn, the relative contribution of CDOM to light attenuation was lower than that of phytoplankton. We conclude that suspended particulate matter, rather than dissolved organic matter, is the dominant factor for PAR attenuation in Lake Taihu.					ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012; Le, Chengfeng/A-2584-2013														1863-9135						2007	170	1					11	19		10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0170-0011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0170-0011													WOS:000251469200002

Surveys of these channels (dykes) in Broadland in eastern England [UK] reveal similar fish communities whether the dykes drain grazing march, fenland or arable land, though there are indications of poor recruitment in the recently deeply drained dykes of arable land. The species encountered most predictably were pike, roach, eel and tench. In terms of biomass, pike ranked top, followed by tench, bream and roach. Eels could not be sampled quantitatively but they must rank in the top five species in terms of biomass. Ordination and other analyses of community structure revealed several physicochemical and biotic factors that correlate with fish distribution and abundance. In particular, the presence of a floating plant mat in summer was associated with low oxygen concentrations at night and the absence of roach. The composition of fish communities in dykes contrasts in a number of ways with those recorded in local rivers and lakes (broads).

Midlatitude Ozone Depletion and Air Quality Impacts from Industrial Halogen Emissions in the Great Salt Lake Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We report aircraft observations of extreme levels of HCl and the dihalogens Cl-2, Br-2, and BrCl in an industrial plume near the Great Salt Lake, Utah. Complete depletion of O3 was observed concurrently with halogen enhancements as a direct result of photochemically produced halogen radicals. Observed fluxes for Cl-2, HCl, and NOx agreed with facility-reported emissions inventories. Bromine emissions are not required to be reported in the inventory, but are estimated as 173 Mg year(-1) Br-2 and 949 Mg year(-1) BrCl, representing a major uncounted oxidant source. A zero-dimensional photochemical box model reproduced the observed O(3 )depletions and demonstrated that bromine radical cycling was principally responsible for the rapid O3 depletion. Inclusion of observed halogen emissions in both the box model and a 3D chemical model showed significant increases in oxidants and particulate matter (PM2.5) in the populated regions of the Great Salt Lake Basin, where winter PM2.5 is among the most severe air quality issues in the U.S. The model shows regional PM2.5 increases of 10%-25% attributable to this single industrial halogen source, demonstrating the impact of underreported industrial bromine emissions on oxidation sources and air quality within a major urban area of the western U.S.					Brown, Steven/I-1762-2013; Murphy, Jennifer/C-2367-2011; Thornton, Joel/C-1142-2009; Veres, Patrick/E-7441-2010; Middlebrook, Ann/E-4831-2011; Womack, Caroline/C-7818-2016; Franchin, Alessandro/GVR-8219-2022; McDonald, Brian/B-5897-2015; Jo, Duseong/E-5085-2016; Jo, Duseong/HKO-0712-2023; McDuffie, Erin/F-7268-2016	Thornton, Joel/0000-0002-5098-4867; Middlebrook, Ann/0000-0002-2984-6304; Harkins, Colin/0000-0001-5692-3427; Womack, Caroline/0000-0002-7101-9054; Murphy, Jennifer/0000-0001-8865-5463; Goldberger, Lexie/0000-0003-1507-6422; Jo, Duseong/0000-0002-7794-1277; McDuffie, Erin/0000-0002-6845-6077; Veres, Patrick/0000-0001-7539-353X													0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 7	2023	57	5					1870	1881		10.1021/acs.est.2c05376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c05376								36695819					WOS:000935603200001

Methods: We examined Fagus crenata regeneration for seven years in an old-growth Fagus-Sasa forest near Lake Towada, northern Japan. by examining the effects of simultaneous death of Sasa, tree canopy gap formation, mast seeding of Fagus and seed and seedling predation by rodents on the survival of Fagus seeds and current year seedlings. We established four types, of sites differing in forest canopy (closed or Gap) and Sasa status (dead or alive) following the simultaneous flowering, and death of Sasa kurilensis (dwarf bamboo) in 1995. Results: Fallen Fagus seed was abundant in 1997 and 2000 (mast years). In sites with alive Sasa, survival from the first growing season was low due to hi-h seed and seedling predation. In sites with dead Sasa. seed survival under the canopy was high for both mast years, but in gaps it varied between years. Seedling survival was highest in canopy Gaps with dead Sasa (gap-dead) in 1998, because of higher light levels and lower predation by rodents. However, seedling survival in these plots was low in 2001, apparently because rapid Sasa recovery favoured rodent predation. In both mast years, Sasa die-back had significant positive effects on seed and seedling survival tinder closed canopies because the seedlings there were more successful in escaping predation. Conclusion: The change in successful sites for the early stage of regeneration of Fagus appears to reflect the combined effects of canopy gap, seed/seedling predation and revegetation of Sasa.					; Nakashizuka, Tohru/AAO-1081-2020	Nakashizuka, Tohru/0000-0003-1419-9527; 													1100-9233	1654-1103				FEB	2005	16	1					49	56		10.1658/1100-9233(2005)016[0049:SCAROF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1658/1100-9233(2005)016[0049:SCAROF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000228391900006

We aimed to assess the whitefish vulnerability to catfish in a French peri-Alpine lake (Lake Bourget) by combining diet analyses (metabarcoding), trophic link inferences from an allometric niche model (aNM), and the development of a predation risk metric derived from species depth matching and catfish energy demand. Whitefish DNA was found in 7% of catfish intestines, indicating a low but effective consumption. The aNM suggested that catfish (considering the current population size structure) may predate all whitefish life stages; though young-of-the-year (0+, 5-20 cm) may be the most exposed to predation. 0+ had higher depth matching with catfish than other life stages, especially in summer when the catfish exhibit their highest energy demand, leading to an overall higher predation risk. Our results highlighted the effective consumption of C. lavaretus by S. glanis and its time and age-varying vulnerability, suggesting that S. glanis may represent a new growing threat to this salmonid in a global change context.					; GUILLARD, Jean/A-2577-2011	Frossard, Victor/0000-0003-1338-4739; Vagnon, Chloe/0000-0002-6201-7110; Guillard, Jean/0000-0003-0116-1167; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2022	79	11					1950	1960		10.1139/cjfas-2021-0310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2021-0310		OCT 2022											WOS:000866281400001

Even though lower depths (>30 m) of the north basin of the lake are cold throughout the year, the only salmonid inhabiting the lake is the Biwa salmon Oncorhynchus sp. However, between 2018 and 2021, five white-spotted charr were caught in Lake Biwa, their phenotype being characterized by large whitish spots, reminiscent of the anadromous form off northern Japan. Mitochondrial DNA Cyt b haplotype analysis data supported their origin as hatchery-reared specimens from Samegai Trout Farm (Shiga Prefecture), the latter having sourced white-spotted charr from several Japanese populations, including northern Japan (descending anadromous exists). Such white-spotted charr, upon release from the hatchery, may have migrated to the lake during winter, due to a retained migration instinct.

Improved temperature retrieval methods for the validation of a hydrodynamic simulation of a partially frozen power plant cooling lake	THERMOSENSE XXXII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Thermosense XXXII	APR 06-07, 2010	Orlando, FL	SPIE				The ALGE code is a hydrodynamic model developed by Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to derive the power output levels of an electric generation facility from observing the associated cooling pond with an aerial imaging platform. Over the past two years work has been completed to extend the capabilities of the model to incorporate snow and ice as possible phenomena in the modeled environment. In order to validate the extension of the model, intensive ground truth data as well as high-resolution aerial infrared imagery were collected during the winters of 2008-2009 and 2009-2010, for a combined eight months of data collection. Due to the harsh and extreme environmental conditions automatic data collection instruments were designed and deployed. Based on experience gained during the first collection season and equipment design failures, overhauls in the design and operation of the automated data collection buoys were performed. In addition, a more thorough and robust twofold calibration technique was implemented within the aerial imaging chain to assess the accuracy of the retrieved surface temperatures. By design, the calibration method employed in this application uses ground collected, geo-located water surface temperatures and in-flight blackbody imagery to produce accurate temperature maps of the pond in interest. A sensitivity analysis was implemented within the data reduction technique to produce accurate sensor reaching temperature values using designed equipment and methods for temperature retrieval at the water's surface.

J	MIHOK, S				MIHOK, S			BEHAVIOR OF SUBARCTIC RED-BACKED VOLES (CLETHRIONOMYS-GAPPERI-ATHABASCAE)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Interactions between pairs of red-backed voles were observed in a neutral observation arena in the summer of 1975 at Heart Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada. Twenty-one behaviors were recorded for each vole and were simplified to 6 factors of behavior: amicable, defensive, aggressive, avoidance, subordinate and fighting. The behavior of one vole towards another in a trial was classified into defensive, avoidance, amicable and aggressive types by unweighted pair group method (UPGM) cluster analysis. It was possible to partially predict behavior on the basis of individual parameters such as: sex, age and reproductive condition. The relationship between individuals showed better predictability, although the behavior of each individual was variable. Male-female encounters were generally amicable with the female being dominant. Female-female encounters were similar to male-male encounters; avoidance, defensive and aggressive behavior predominated. Dominant females were generally older or in a later stage of pregnancy. Dominant males did not represent any consistent trends in age, sexual maturity or weight differences. Mutual avoidance was the most common type of interaction.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1976	54	11					1932	1945		10.1139/z76-224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z76-224													WOS:A1976CM85000014
J	Obolewski, K				Obolewski, Krystian			Using Macrozoobenthos to Assess the Ecological Condition of the Estuary Lake Jamno.	OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the macrozoobenthos structure in the Jamno Lake were conducted in the summer seasons of 2005 and 2006. The sampling sites (15) were chosen so as to enable the determination of the benthic fauna structure in particular basins (Jamno Mate, Jamno Centralne and Jamno Osieckie) and in the horizontal profiles (northern, central and southern), taking into account the influence of saline waters from the Baltic Sea. The results obtained have revealed that the ecological condition of the water region is very bad. The biodiversity of the benthic macrofauna in the Jamno Lake is poor, consisting of nine taxones only, where Oligochaeta and Chironomidae larvae (represented primarily by the genera Chironomus and Procladius) are dominant. According to the BMWP-PL index, the lake water quality is generally very low, except for that in the central zone of the Jamno reservoir. The value of the OQR index obtained (<1.9) indicates that the basins of the Jamno Mate Lake and Osieckie Lake include waters of very low quality, and that the quality of the Central Jamno Lake water is slightly higher owing to the inflow of saline water from the Baltic. The widest biodiversity of the macrozoobenthos was found to occur in the Central Jamno Lake, as well as in the central horizontal profile, and the poorest biodiversity in the Jamno Osieckie Lake and the northern profile. The highest concentration of macrozoobenthos organisms was detected in the Jamno Male Lake and the central profile, and the lowest in the Jamno Osieckie Lake and the southern profile. Biomass analysis has revealed the highest values in the northern zone and the Central Jamno Lake, and the lowest ones in the central profile and the Jamno Mate Lake. It is recommended that the application of any revitalization methods should be preceded by detailed hydrobiological studies in order to protect the restoring ecological formations.

Severity of barotrauma influences the physiological status, postrelease behavior, and fate of tournament-caught smallmouth bass	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Much research on the fish physiological consequences of tournaments has been conducted to date and has provided anglers and tournament organizers with strategies for reducing stress and mortality. However, one aspect of tournaments that has received little attention is barotrauma. At a fall competitive angling event on Rainy Lake in northwestern Ontario, we evaluated the incidence of barotrauma among tournament-caught smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu; we then tagged and released a subset of fish that had severe barotrauma indicators and compared physiology, postrelease behavior, and fate between these fish and those with negligible signs of barotrauma. Overall, 76% of fish had at least one sign of barotraurna (either hemorrhaging or swim bladder distention), but only 32% of fish had two or more indicators and were thus deemed to have severe barotrauma. When telemetered fish were released at a common site, we determined that fish with negligible signs of barotrauma evacuated the release site more rapidly than fish with severe barotrauma did. Some fish with barotraurna floundered at the surface when released, and one of these fish was subsequently hit and killed by a boat. At the end of the monitoring period, 20% of fish with severe barotrauma had died; two additional individuals (20%) that were still at the release site were moribund (failed to respond to diver stimuli). Conversely, we failed to observe any mortality in fish with negligible signs of barotrauma. All tournament fish had elevated levels of blood glucose and lactate. However, stress indices were higher in fish with barotrauma and tended to be highest among fish with barotrauma that died after release. This study revealed that the incidence of barotrauma in tournaments can be high; moreover, outside of a laboratory environment, a significant proportion of fish with severe barotrauma may die after release. Additional research is needed to determine the seasonal variation in incidence and consequences of barotrauma as well as the effectiveness of different depressurization techniques in the field that could be used during fishing tournaments.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2008	28	2					607	617		10.1577/M07-013.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M07-013.1													WOS:000255310300026

Such waves can occur in lakes and fjords, or due to glacier calving in bays or at steep ocean coastlines. Infrastructure and residential houses along coastlines of those waterbodies are often situated on low elevation terrain, and are potentially at risk from inundation. Impulse waves, running up a uniform slope and generating an overland flow over an initially dry adjacent horizontal plane, represent a frequently found scenario, which needs to be better understood for disaster planning and mitigation. This study presents a novel set of large-scale flume test focusing on solitary waves propagating over a 1:14.5 slope and breaking onto a horizontal section. Examining the characteristics of overland flow, this study gives, for the first time, insight into the fundamental process of overland flow of a broken solitary wave: its shape and celerity, as well as its momentum when wave breaking has taken place beforehand.

J	Chattová, B; Lebouvier, M; Van de Vijver, B				Chattova, Barbora; Lebouvier, Marc; Van de Vijver, Bart			Freshwater diatom communities from Ile Amsterdam (TAAF, southern Indian Ocean)	FOTTEA												Diatom and water chemistry samples were collected during the austral summer of 2007 from lakes, streams and bogponds on Ile Amsterdam (TAAF), a small island located in the southern Indian Ocean. A diverse diatom flora of 104 taxa was found, dominated by several Pinnularia taxa, Frustulia lebouvieri, Kobayasiella subantarctica, Eunotia paludosa, E. muscicola and Planothidium subantarcticum. Biogeographically, the Ile Amsterdam freshwater diatom flora is composed of cosmopolitan, sub-Antarctic and endemic elements. The biogeographical analysis showed that almost 17% of all observed taxa can be considered endemic to Ile Amsterdam with an additional 14% showing an exclusive sub-Antarctic distribution. The flora can be considered as typical for oceanic islands based on its disharmonic composition with several genera lacking and other being overrepresented. Canonical Component Analysis was used to classify the samples based on their chemical characteristics, revealing that, specific conductance, sulphate and pH were the main factors dividing the samples into four different groups. The geological history of the island in combination with the climate and the specific environmental features of the main habitat in the Caldera most likely shaped the composition of the actual diatom communities.					; Van de Vijver, Bart/A-4572-2013	Van de Vijver, Bart/0000-0002-6244-1886; 													1802-5439						2014	14	1					101	119		10.5507/fot.2014.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.5507/fot.2014.008													WOS:000334587400008

The study consisted of systematic measurements that were carried out daily during freezing and thawing and every two or three days after the ice cover had formed. The first ice phenomena in the water bodies analysed in the form of a thin layer of ice in the coastal zone appeared on 26 November 2010. The destruction of the compact ice cover began with the onset of positive temperatures in March. The rate of its disappearance varied, and the last ice phenomena in the water bodies analysed were observed on 17 March 2011. The duration of ice phenomena in these water bodies was similar. The longest duration (110 days) was observed in the Cegielnia water body, while the shortest one (107 days) in the Zwirownia one. The maximum thickness of the ice cover exhibited slightly greater variation (19.0 cm - 21.5 cm). The observations conducted make it possible to claim that the ice regime in the water bodies studied is quasi-natural and individual phases of the seasonal freezing cycle result from local, mostly natural conditions. The existing differences related to the freezing and thawing of the water surface stemmed mainly from morphometric differences between the limnic water bodies studied.

J	SMITH, DT				SMITH, DT			WOOLLYLEAF BURSAGE CONTROL WITH MONOSODIUM METHANEARSONATE AND TILLAGE	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Woolyleaf bursage (Franseria tomentosa Gray) which infests approximately 70,000 ha of cropland in Great Plains states [USA] is susceptible to MSMA (monosodium methanearsonate). MSMA and DSMA (disodium methanearsonate) were investigated under several conditions for control of this weed. The most effective control occurred when MSMA was applied in mid-late May after all shoots had emerged in the spring. Experiments were conducted in playa lakebeds on Randall clay (Udic Pellusterts). Woollyleaf bursage was consistently more susceptible to MSMA than DSMA. Roots were killed to depths of 30 cm or more. Moldboard plowing of infested areas delayed, rather than reduced, shoot emergence. In contrast, a disking operation allowed weed shoots to emerge earlier and more uniformly, which resulted in greater effectiveness of MSMA. Soil moisture and crop yields were increased when MSMA was applied to woollyleaf bursage before planting cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). One year after treatment with MSMA, woollyleaf bursage control was still evident, and sudangrass [Sorghum sudanense Stapp (''Piper'')] yields were increased in treated areas.																			0002-1962	1435-0645					1976	68	4					657	660		10.2134/agronj1976.00021962006800040031x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1976.00021962006800040031x													WOS:A1976BY11800030

Using Be-10 dating we determined the ages of 21 boulders on moraines in the Santa Cruz Valley, Peru (similar to 10 degrees S, altitudes ~ 4100 to ~ 4300 m a.s.l.). Former glacier extent is marked by a suite of nested outer lateral and terminal moraines. These moraines are dated to 11.1 ka, 11.6 ka, 11.8 ka and 12.0 ka, falling within the Younger Dryas Chronozone (YDC; similar to 12.9-11.6 ka). Nine Be-10 samples from the Lake Arhuaycocha catchment document a period of glacier thinning and lateral contraction between 12.0 ka and 11.8 ka. Reconstructed glacier Equilibrium Line Altitudes (ELA) at 11.0 to 12.0 ka with an area-altitude balance ratio (AABR) of 1.00-2.50 are between 4675 and 4835 m a.s.l. for the Arhuaycocha glacier, between 4692 and 4832 m a.s.l. for the Taullicocha glacier and between 4800 and 4940 m a.s.l. for the Artizon glacier. These values represent a depression of 300-400 m in elevation compared to contemporary values for the ELA. We infer that the glacier advances at this time were driven by increased precipitation and that these changes were most likely a response to seasonal changes in the position of the ITCZ.

J	An, SQ; Yan, JS; Yu, XS				An, SQ; Yan, JS; Yu, XS			Grey-system studies on agricultural ecoengineering in the Taihu Lake Area, Jiangsu, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A grey-system model was used to simulate and predict changes of nine key parameters in an agro-ecosystem and energy efficiencies of the crop subsystem in the area. The model, which satisfactorily fitted original data, predicted that population, energy production by crops in sum or per hectare, energy production by fishery, and energy input through machinery would increase, but that cropland area, energy production by livestocks and energy input through pesticides and herbicides would decrease. Energy input through fertilizers was predicted to fluctuate in the future. Energy efficiency, total and net energy allocation for people, would slow down in next ten years as the replacement of traditional agriculture by petroleum agriculture takes place. The grey catastrophic prediction model showed that two low energy production years or disaster years would be expected before year 2050, although the trend of the production would increase in future. The grey correlation coefficient showed that disaster years would emerge because short frost-free days, especially low temperature in the spring, would happen in those years.																			0925-8574					NOV	1996	7	3					235	245		10.1016/0925-8574(96)00011-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0925-8574(96)00011-0													WOS:A1996VT62400005

Understanding the evolution of topics in diatom research will provide a clear and needed guide to strengthen research on diatoms. However, such an overview remains unavailable. In this study, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative model, to identify topics and determine their trends (i.e., cold and hot topics) by analyzing the abstracts of 19,000 publications from the Web of Science that were related to diatoms during 1991-2018. A total of 116 topics were identified from a Bayesian model selection. The hot topics (diversity, environmental indicator, climate change, land use, and water quality) that were identified by LDA indicated that diatoms are increasingly used as indicators to assess water quality and identify modern climate change impacts due to intensive anthropogenic activities. In terms of cold topics (growth rate, culture growth, cell life history, copepod feeding, grazing by microzooplankton, zooplankton predation, and primary productivity) and hot topics (spatial-temporal distribution, morphology, molecular identification, gene expression, and review), we determined that basic studies on diatoms have decreased and that studies tend to be more comprehensive. This study notes that future directions in diatom research will be closely associated with the application of diatoms in environmental management and climate change to cope with environmental challenges, and more comprehensive issues related to diatoms should be considered.					; TAO, JUAN/N-1699-2015; Yang, Yingying/GRS-1048-2022; ZHOU, Qichao/KGM-3385-2024; Li, Dunhai/F-8851-2012	ZHOU, Qichao/0000-0002-4292-9817; Li, Dunhai/0000-0002-1915-4216														2076-2607				AUG	2019	7	8							213	10.3390/microorganisms7080213	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms7080213								31344825					WOS:000482956300028
J	JURGENS, K; GUDE, H				JURGENS, K; GUDE, H			THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF GRAZING-RESISTANT BACTERIA IN PLANKTONIC SYSTEMS	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The paradigm of the 'microbial loop' has became increasingly important for understanding the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. Most of the microbial loop studies have focused on energy flow and nutrient cycling. Much less is known, however, about the importance of grazing as a force shaping the structure and community composition of planktonic bacteria. Theoretical considerations of predator-prey interactions suggest that predator evasion mechanisms should have evolved for bacteria in the same way as in other predator-prey systems (e.g. zooplankton-phytoplankton). Consistent with this hypothesis, field data show that bacteria are often the most stable component of planktonic communities. Refuges from grazing are one of the possible mechanisms buffering bacterioplankton against strong seasonal fluctuations in abundance. Substantial direct and indirect evidence exists for the occurrence of grazing-resistant bacteria (GRB) in both marine and freshwater habitats. We summarize the potential mechanisms for grazing resistance, including morphological, chemical and behavioral defenses as well as growth in spatial refuges. Cell size appears to be an important factor influencing susceptibility to grazing, with a refuge at the lower and upper ends of the bacterial size range. Thus, a relative grazing resistance can be assumed for the large number of ultramicrobacteria as well as for morphologically complex growth forms such as filaments and aggregates. Besides morphological features, resistance may be achieved by other mechanisms for which, however, much less information is available. We describe how GRB can be included in conceptual models of the interactions among metazooplankton, bacterivorous protozoans and bacteria. It is suggested that the relative importance of GRB increases with increasing grazing pressure exerted by protozoans, whereas it decreases with increasing top-down control of protozoans by metazooplankton. GRB may reduce the productivity of planktonic systems through decreased trophic transfer efficiencies and reduced regeneration of bacterially bound nutrients.

Similar analyses were performed on groundwater samples taken from wells near each lake. Concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, SO4- were significantly higher in lakes of the Grantsburg lobe, whereas K+, SiO2 and HCO3- were significantly higher in samples of groundwater from the Grantsburg lobe. There was no correlation between groundwater concentration of particular ions and lake-water concentrations of the same ions, implying that the sources of dissolved ions in lake water are shallow groundwater and soil leachates rather than the deepr groundwater sampled here. Na+ and Cl- concentrations in some lakes appear to be strongly infleunced by the use of de-icing salt on highways in winter rather than by differences in drift lithology.

Terrestrial examples are the snow and lake ice packs. The microwave propagation time tau(delay) through the pack yields a measure of its vertical extent. We report measurements of the icepack on Lake Superior, and the snowpack at University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) in winter 2014 and 2015, respectively. The observations are done at frequencies from 7 to 10 GHz for icepack and 1 to 3 GHz for snowpack. At these frequencies, the volume and surface scattering are small in the packs. This technique is inherently low-power since there is no transmitter as opposed to active remote sensing techniques. In this paper the system design parameters of the WiBAR is discussed and it is shown that the microwave travel time within a dry snow pack and lake ice pack can be readily measured for a wide range of layer thicknesses observed during the experiment.

In this study, to investigate general population PBDE exposure, air was sampled in 74 randomly selected homes in Ottawa, Canada and at seven outdoor sites during the winter of 2002-3, using polyurethane foam (PUF) disk passive air samplers. The passive sampling rate (2.5 m(3) day(-1)) was determined through a pilot study employing active and passive samplers side-by-side at selected indoor locations. Indoor air concentrations of PBDEs were log-normally distributed with a geometric mean of 120 pg m(-3) and a median of 100 pg m(-3), approximately 50 times higher than the range of outdoor air concentrations (<0.1-4.4 pg m(-3)). The maximum daily human exposure via the inhalation pathway based on median PBDE levels found in this survey was estimated to be 1.9 ng day(-1) (female) and 2.0 ng day(-1) (male), representing 4.1% (f) and 4.4% (m) of overall daily intake.					; Zhu, Jiping/R-8091-2016; Jones, Kevin/F-4296-2014	Zhu, Jiping/0000-0003-1917-7343; Jones, Kevin Christopher/0000-0001-7108-9776													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 15	2004	38	20					5312	5318		10.1021/es049260x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es049260x								15543731					WOS:000224519500014

The use of zooplankton distribution maps for assessment of ecological status of the Shardara reservoir (Southern Kazakhstan)	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												The spatial distribution of biological indicators of zooplankton in Shardara reservoir (southern Kazakhstan) was investigated in summer 2015. The development of macrophytes in the water area significantly affected the species diversity of zooplankton. Copepoda avoided places with high concentrations of polyphosphates from detergents, but gained a competitive advantage on water areas polluted by beta-HCCH. The most favorable conditions for Cladocera, represented mostly by Daphnia galeata, were formed on parts of the reservoir with high content of phosphates, nitrites, zinc and accumulation of green algae. Cladocera avoided waters with a high content of lead, copper and cadmium. Statistical maps of distribution of Delta-Shannon, Clarke's W-statistics and average individual mass did not reveal any certain relations with environmental variables, which we attribute to the complex nature of the Shardara reservoir's pollution. A strong relationship between the Delta-Shannon and Clarke's W-statistics parameters was found. It was found that Delta-Shannon is easily calculated and can be used for the zooplankton community structure description.

J	Lake, BA; Coolidge, KM; Norton, SA; Amirbahman, A				Lake, Bjorn A.; Coolidge, Kyle M.; Norton, Stephen A.; Amirbahman, Aria			Factors contributing to the internal loading of phosphorus from anoxic sediments in six Maine, USA, lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Phosphorus (P) is the limiting macronutrient for primary production in most lakes. Seasonal anoxia in the hypolimnion of lakes has been strongly correlated with internal P loading to the water column. Gravimetric sediment cores were collected before and after the onset of anoxia in six Maine (USA) lakes during the summer of 2003. This study investigates the relative importance of P sequestration by aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)(3(s))), and ferric (oxy)hydroxide (Fe(OH)(3(S))) dissolution with subsequent P release in lakes with varying trophic status. Two lakes, Pennesseewassee and Highland, are oligotrophic. The remaining lakes, China, Cobbosseecontee, Webber and Salmon, have varying levels of productivity. Sediment P, Al and Fe in the top 10 cm were extracted sequentially using ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), bicarbonate-dithionite (BD), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 25 degrees C. The results suggest that a sediment [NH4Cl - Al + BD - Al + NaOH25-Al]:[NH4Cl - Fe + BD - Fe] molarratio > 3 and a sediment [NaOH25-Al]:[NH4Cl - P + BD-P] molar ratio > 25 predict low P flux from sediments during the development of anoxia, as proposed by Kopacek et al. [Kopacek J, Borovec J, Hejzlar J, Ulrich K, Norton S, Amirbahman A. Aluminum control of Phosphorus Sorption in Lake Sediments. Environ Sci Technol 2005; 39: 8784-8789.], despite the development of anoxia in and the release of Fe(II) from the hypolimnia of the two study lakes. However, when these molar ratios are not exceeded the model does not adequately describe sedimentary P flux. The application of the model proposed by Kopacek et al. to Cobbosseecontee Lake suggests that its sediment may be a source of P to the water column. However, water column data indicate little to no sedimentary P flux. Therefore, the lack of P flux may be attributed to the absence of Fe (III) reduction in the Cobbosseecontee Lake sediment or perhaps to the slow diagenesis of organically-bound P.

A comparison of three methods to evaluate otter latrine activity	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												We compared methods commonly used in the field of river otter (Lontra canadensis) ecology to estimate visitation rates. We evaluated visitation rates estimated from 2 survey protocols based on video detection-individual visitation rate (IVR) and recording visitation rate (RVR)-and one indirect method based on scat detection-scat visitation rate (SVR). From August 2011 through August 2012, overall scat detection and cumulative video data from 403 camera-days in 2 latrine sites (River and Pond, at a study site adjacent to the Salt Fork of the Vermilion River near Fairmount, Illinois, USA) located <50 m apart did not reveal monthly or seasonal differences between SVR and video detection methods. We identified positive correlations among the 3 visitation rates and differences between overall IVR and RVR. All 3 methods resulted in peak visitation rates during winter. However, when these data were stratified by latrine site, we found both positive and negative correlations at the River latrine. Our work supports that SVR, IVR, and RVR are valuable methods to estimate otter visitation rates at latrine sites. However, it is clear that even within such a short distance between these 2 latrines, these methods detected differences in site utilization. The significant positive correlation observed between IVR and RVR (overall and by latrine site) suggests these methods can be used interchangeably. Otter detection using SVR may serve as a complementary assessment tool for IVR and RVR. To optimize cross-study comparisons and interpretation of results, future studies should detail the type of otter detection and visitation rate used, how variables are measured, formulas used in the calculation of the visitation rates, and detailed descriptions of scat counting efforts when using scat as a tool to evaluate otter visitation rates.

J	Tan, X				Tan, Xiao			Comparison of benthic recruitment with pelagic growth of bloom-forming cyanobacteria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH												In eutrophic lakes, overwintering bloom-forming cyanobacteria such as Microcystis re-inoculate the water column in the spring, contributing to pelagic development as a cell source for initial pelagic growth and a direct inoculum for continued pelagic development as well. In the present study, recruitment and pelagic growth of cyanobacteria were monitored by using migration traps and phytoplankton chambers at a study site near Meiliang Bay (1.5 m deep) in Taihu Lake from March to June, 2008. Cell abundance from both sources was compared synchronously; in the meantime water temperature was recorded using an automatic sonde. Results showed that recruitment and pelagic growth of cyanobacteria already started at 11 degrees C, and showed changing patterns over the time of the study. Benthic recruitment only accounted for a small portion of pelagic growth, which is similar to that found in deep lakes. Taken together, these findings suggest that studies on cyanobacteria blooms development should be mainly focused on the pelagic population development.																			1996-0808					APR 16	2012	6	14					3425	3430		10.5897/AJMR11.1324	http://dx.doi.org/10.5897/AJMR11.1324													WOS:000303823800008

Newspapers as sources of historical information about lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817)	ARCHIVES OF NATURAL HISTORY												As part of an attempt to reconstruct the original distribution and relative abundance of lake sturgeon in tributaries to Lake Michigan, old newspapers were surveyed for accounts of sturgeon captured by sport and commercial fishers. The reliability of this process was assessed in several ways. A historical column in a modern newspaper (De Pere journal) proved useful for identifying the time period during which original accounts of sturgeon were first published (late 1800s early 1900s) and the season when most historical catches occurred (the spring spawning season), but a complete survey of the original newspapers revealed many more records than resurfaced in the historical column and some significant accounts that were published outside of the spawning season. Independent surveys of De Pere newspapers by different searchers revealed that the average searcher found a majority of known records (more than 90%). The seasonal distribution of catches in the Lower Fox River as revealed by historical newspaper accounts was very similar to that based on modern sightings, and the newspaper contained several accounts of sturgeon in other parts of the drainage or other parts of Wisconsin. However, comparison with newspapers published in the neighbouring community of Green Bay revealed that the latter included few of the incidents reported in the De Pere paper, and few additional accounts appeared in the Green Bay papers that were not reported in De Pere. Although the De Pere newspaper accounts taken alone reveal a history of sturgeon exploitation in this microcosm remarkably parallel to patterns of sturgeon exploitation nationwide, our initial focus on the De Pere paper appears to have been fortuitous in that few local newspapers along the Lake Michigan shoreline would have yielded comparable amounts of historical information.																			0260-9541					APR	2012	39	1					136	146		10.3366/anh.2012.0066	http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/anh.2012.0066													WOS:000303373200010

Ash from the Toba supereruption in Lake Malawi shows no volcanic winter in East Africa at 75 ka	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The most explosive volcanic event of the Quaternary was the eruption of Mt. Toba, Sumatra, 75,000 y ago, which produced voluminous ash deposits found across much of the Indian Ocean, Indian Peninsula, and South China Sea. A major climatic downturn observed within the Greenland ice cores has been attributed to the cooling effects of the ash and aerosols ejected during the eruption of the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT). These events coincided roughly with a hypothesized human genetic bottleneck, when the number of our species in Africa may have been reduced to near extinction. Some have speculated that the demise of early modern humans at that time was due in part to a dramatic climate shift triggered by the supereruption. Others have argued that environmental conditions would not have been so severe to have such an impact on our ancestors, and furthermore, that modern humans may have already expanded beyond Africa by this time. We report an observation of the YTT in Africa, recovered as a cryptotephra layer in Lake Malawi sediments, > 7,000 km west of the source volcano. The YTT isochron provides an accurate and precise age estimate for the Lake Malawi paleoclimate record, which revises the chronology of past climatic events in East Africa. The YTT in Lake Malawi is not accompanied by a major change in sediment composition or evidence for substantial temperature change, implying that the eruption did not significantly impact the climate of East Africa and was not the cause of a human genetic bottleneck at that time.

J	Reasoner, MA; Jodry, MA				Reasoner, MA; Jodry, MA			Rapid response of alpine timberline vegetation to the Younger Dryas climate oscillation in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, USA	GEOLOGY												Paleobotanical records from two high-altitude (>3300 m) sites in Colorado show a clear and immediate response to the Younger Dryas climate oscillation. The Black Mountain Lake and Sky Pond records indicate that alpine timberline migrated upslope to near-modern elevations during the late Bolling-Allerod (13.6-12.9 ka). Subsequent declines in arboreal pollen percentages and accumulation rates during the Younger Dryas interval (12.9-11.7 ka) reflect a downslope displacement of the alpine timberline ecotone of 60-120 m in elevation. This change translates to a cooling of summer temperature by similar to 0.4-0.9 degrees C and is consistent,vith proposed Younger Dryas advances of alpine glaciers in the Rocky Mountains to positions close to Little Ice Age maxima. Alpine timberline readvanced upslope to elevations above both sites between 11.7 and 11.4 ka. The concomitant response of temperature-sensitive alpine timberline vegetation in Colorado and late-glacial changes in North Atlantic thermohaline circulation implicates a rapid, widespread atmospheric transmission of the Younger Dryas climate oscillation.																			0091-7613					JAN	2000	28	1					51	54																WOS:000084568100013

While previous studies have mostly described this unique system from a geochemical perspective, to date there has been no comprehensive geophysical investigation of the system. In our study, we surveyed the lake using a thermocouple, a thermal camera, an echo sounder and CO2 sensors. Furthermore, we gained insights into the hydrogeological structures by combining self-potential surveys with ground and water temperatures. Our results show that the hydrothermal system is self-sealed within the upper edifice and releases pressurized gas only through the active crater. We also show that the extensive hydrological system is formed by not one but three aquifers: a south aquifer that seems to be completely isolated, a west aquifer that sustains the acidic upper springs, and an east aquifer that is the main source of fresh water for the lake. In contrast with previous research, we emphasize the heterogeneity of the acidic lake, illustrated by intense subaqueous degassing. These findings provide new insights into this unique, hazardous hydrothermal system, which may eventually improve the existing monitoring system.					; Williams-Jones, Glyn/A-9807-2008; Caudron, Corentin/V-8040-2017; SARACCO, Gineth or Ginette/JTU-2684-2023	Saracco, Ginette/0000-0002-3101-7556; Williams-Jones, Glyn/0000-0001-9862-5444; Bernard, Alain/0000-0003-2651-7051; Caudron, Corentin/0000-0002-3748-0007; Peiffer, Loic/0000-0002-2036-8449; Lecocq, Thomas/0000-0002-4988-6477; 													0305-8719		978-1-78620-244-4				2017	437						57	72		10.1144/SP437.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP437.4													WOS:000404905700005
J	Lyon, J; Stuart, I; Ramsey, D; O'Mahony, J				Lyon, Jarod; Stuart, Ivor; Ramsey, David; O'Mahony, Justin			The effect of water level on lateral movements of fish between river and off-channel habitats and implications for management	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Off-channel habitats, such as wetlands and backwaters, are important for the productivity of river systems and for many species of native fish. This study aimed to investigate the fish community, timing and cues that stimulated movement to and from off-channel habitats in the highly regulated Lake Hume to Lake Mulwala reach of the Murray River, south-eastern Australia. In 2004-05, 193 712 fish were collected moving bi-directionally between a 50-km section of the Murray River and several off-channel habitats. Lateral fish movements approximated water level fluctuations. Generally as water levels rose, fish left the main river channel and moved into newly flooded off-channel habitats; there was bidirectional movement as water levels peaked; on falling levels fish moved back to the permanent riverine habitats. Fish previously classified as 'wetland specialists', such as carp gudgeons (Hypseleotris spp.), have a more flexible movement and life-history strategy including riverine habitation. The high degree of lateral movement indicates the importance of habitat connectivity for the small-bodied fish community. Wetlands adjacent to the Murray River are becoming increasingly regulated by small weirs and ensuring lateral fish movement will be important in maintaining riverine-wetland biodiversity.						lyon, jarod/0000-0002-8762-4128													1323-1650						2010	61	3					271	278		10.1071/MF08246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF08246													WOS:000276030500002

Trophic relationships of breeding Red-necked Grebes (Podiceps grisegena) on wetlands with and without fish in the Aspen Parkland	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Dietary overlap between waterbirds and fish in many freshwater systems can lead to competition for food resources and changes in the trophic position of top predators. We used stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen from egg tissues to document differences in the trophic position of breeding Red-necked Grebes (Podiceps grisegena (Boddaert, 1783)) on wetlands with and without fish in the Aspen Parkland of Alberta, Canada. Grebes occupied higher trophic levels in the presence of fish than in their absence, suggesting that small-bodied fish in Aspen Parkland food webs may lengthen food chains in which grebes are top predators. A mixed diet of invertebrates and fishes may be adaptive for grebes in this highly variable ecosystem where fish colonize wetlands in wet years and are extirpated in dry years. Carbon analyses indicated that female grebes likely obtained resources for egg production from breeding sites and not from wintering areas, as eggs had similar delta C-13 values to wetland primary producers, invertebrates, and fishes.

J	Hovius, JT; Beisner, BE; McCann, KS				Hovius, JT; Beisner, BE; McCann, KS			Epilimnetic rotifer community responses to Bythotrephes longimanus invasion in Canadian Shield lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied whether the effects of Bythotrephes longimanus, a new predatory cladoceran zooplankton species to North America, can extend beyond the macrozooplankton to the rotifer community, which is known to be an important controller of the microbial loop. During summer 2003, 14 Canadian Shield lakes were sampled biweekly to evaluate the effect of Bythotrephes on epilimnetic rotifers. Rotifer densities, particularly those of Conochilus unicornis, significantly increased, with elevated Bythotrephes densities. Conochilus became the dominant rotifer species in the pelagic community of lakes with high B. longimanus populations. Bythotrephes densities were a better estimator of rotifer densities than physical and chemical lake properties. Bythotrephes has indirect effects beyond its preferred prey species, cladocerans. The potential for increased rotifer densities to act as a secondary source of food for Bythotrephes was also investigated. In a 24-h feeding experiment, Bythotrephes did not prey on various common rotifer species, suggesting that Bythotrephes ignores rotifer species as a prey even when they form the sole food source. Rotifer increases are likely either due to competitive release when crustacean zooplankton decline or predatory release when native invertebrate predator populations decline.					; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020	Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; 													0024-3590					MAR	2006	51	2					1004	1012		10.4319/lo.2006.51.2.1004	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.2.1004													WOS:000236343600020

Quantifying rapid spatial and temporal variations of CO2 fluxes from small, lowland freshwater ponds	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small ponds comprise a substantial portion of the total area of the Earth's inland waters. They can be powerful carbon sinks or sources, potentially significant processors of organic carbon. Our understanding of their role is constrained by the absence of information regarding their CO2 fluxes (F CO2) and how these change with wet or dry phases and across distinct pond plant communities. We monitored the F CO2 from 26 neighbouring small ponds over a 2-week drying period in late summer in 2014. The mean F CO2 on day 1 (-641 +/- 1490 mg m(-2) day(-1)) represented a net intake across the site. As ponds dried they switched to becoming CO2 sources resulting in a net site emission of CO2 by day 12 (3792 +/- 2755 mg m(-2) day(-1)) although flux rates did not vary systematically between plant communities. Significant variability in the F CO2 was observed amongst adjacent ponds on individual sampling days, resulting in marked spatial heterogeneity in CO2 processing. This large degree of temporal and spatial heterogeneity across short time periods and small distances highlights the variability in the F CO2 from temporary systems, making it hard to generalize their role in carbon cycle models.					; Deary, Michael/O-7543-2017	Gilbert, Peter J./0000-0003-2356-0951; Deary, Michael/0000-0002-2370-1243													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	793	1					83	93		10.1007/s10750-016-2855-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2855-y													WOS:000399890800006

To understand seasonal variation in phytoplankton composition, abundance and distribution in the DJKR area before water diversion, as well as to estimate potential risks of water quality after water diversion, we conducted an investigation on phytoplankton in the DJKR from August 2008 to May 2009. The investigation included 10 sampling sites, each with four depths of 0.5, 5, 10, and 20 m. In this study, 117 taxa belonging to 76 genera were identified, consisting of diatoms (39 taxa), green algae (47 taxa), blue-green algae (19 taxa), and others (12 taxa). Annual average phytoplankton abundance was 2.01x10(6) ind./L, and the highest value was 14.72 x 10(6) ind/L (at site 3 in August 2008). Phytoplankton abundance in front of the Danjiangkou Dam (DJKD) was higher than that of the Danjiang Reservoir Basin. Phytoplankton distribution showed a vertical declining trend from 0.5 m to 20 m at most sites in August 2008 (especially at sites of 1, 2, 4 and 10), but no distinct pattern in other sampling months. In December 2008 and March 2009, Stephanodiscus sp. was the most abundant species, amounting to 55.23% and 72.34%, respectively. We propose that high abundance of Stephanodiscus sp. may have contributed greatly to the frequent occurrence of Stephanodiscus sp. blooms in middle-low reaches of the Hanjiang River during the early spring of 2009. In comparison with previous studies conducted from 1992 to 2006, annual average phytoplankton density, green algae and blue-green algae species, as well as major nutrient concentrations increased, while phytoplankton diversity indices declined. This indicates a gradual decline in water quality. More research should be conducted and countermeasures taken to prevent further deterioration of water quality in the DJKR.																			0254-4059					MAY	2011	29	3					531	540		10.1007/s00343-011-0120-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-011-0120-9													WOS:000292558100005
J	Fisher, SJ; Pyle, CR; Willis, DW				Fisher, SJ; Pyle, CR; Willis, DW			Habitat use by age-0 yellow perch in two South Dakota glacial lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We determined the habitat use of age-0 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in two South Dakota (USA) lakes. Larval perch abundance was based on trawl catches and related to environmental variables on two late spring dates. Juvenile perch abundance was based on late July shoreline seine and bottom trawl catches. Day and night juvenile abundance relations to environmental variables were examined. Larval abundance appeared to be related to biological environmental variables, and no significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) correlations with physical habitat variables were found. Juvenile yellow perch abundance was related to physical variables, particularly substrate, water temperature and water depth. The only biological variable that could be related to juvenile abundance was chironomid abundance. Finally, juvenile perch abundance was positively associated with abundance of other juvenile fishes and minnows, but these associations varied by lake, time of day and habitat type. Understanding age-9 perch habitat use will allow fishery biologists to better assess sampling designs and recruitment processes.

Transparency, Geomorphology and Mixing Regime Explain Variability in Trends in Lake Temperature and Stratification across Northeastern North America (1975-2014)	WATER												Lake surface water temperatures are warming worldwide, raising concerns about the future integrity of valuable lake ecosystem services. In contrast to surface water temperatures, we know far less about what is happening to water temperature beneath the surface, where most organisms live. Moreover, we know little about which characteristics make lakes more or less sensitive to climate change and other environmental stressors. We examined changes in lake thermal structure for 231 lakes across northeastern North America (NENA), a region with an exceptionally high density of lakes. We determined how lake thermal structure has changed in recent decades (1975-2012) and assessed which lake characteristics are related to changes in lake thermal structure. In general, NENA lakes had increasing near-surface temperatures and thermal stratification strength. On average, changes in deepwater temperatures for the 231 lakes were not significantly different than zero, but individually, half of the lakes experienced warming and half cooling deepwater temperature through time. More transparent lakes (Secchi transparency >5 m) tended to have higher near-surface warming and greater increases in strength of thermal stratification than less transparent lakes. Whole-lake warming was greatest in polymictic lakes, where frequent summer mixing distributed heat throughout the water column. Lakes often function as important sentinels of climate change, but lake characteristics within and across regions modify the magnitude of the signal with important implications for lake biology, ecology and chemistry.

J	Nores, M				Nores, Manuel			Long-term Waterbird Fluctuations in Mar Chiquita Lake, Central Argentina	WATERBIRDS												Bird surveys were carried out from 1973 to 2010 in Mar Chiquita, an extensive saline lake and associated Du Ice River marshes in central Argentina. The wetland has had marked fluctuations in water level and salinity over the past four decades. At the beginning of the 1970s, Mar Chiquita experienced a large drop in level and there were no waterbirds on the Segundo River mouth. By 1974 the lake had recovered its level and the Segundo River estuary had formed, harboring large concentrations of local waterbirds and Nearctic shorebirds. From mid-1977, a rise in water level led to the disappearance of the Segundo River estuary and by 2003 the lake area had expanded by about 3.5 times and covered half of the Du Ice River marshes. Consequently, the wetland, especially the river estuaries, became less important for local waterbirds and Nearctic shorebirds. Since 2003 Mar Chiquita has fallen 4 in, beaches have formed and salinity has increased, but currently there are no Nearctic shorebird concentrations. For the site to recover its importance for birds, Mar Chiquita should continue dropping and salinity continue increasing.

Lake Alchichica is warm monomictic with a 3-month circulation period during the dry, cold season. During the stratified period in the warm, wet season, the hypolimnion became anoxic. N-NH3 ranged between non detectable (n.d.) and 0.98 mg l(-1), N-NO2 between n.d. and 0.007 mg l(-1), N-NO3 from 0.1 to 1.0 mg l(-1) and P-PO4 from n.d. to 0.54 mg l(-1). Highest nutrient concentrations were found in the circulation period. Chlorophyll a varied from <1 to 19.8 mug l(-1) but most values were <5 mug l(-1). The euphotic zone (>1% PAR) usually comprised the top 15-20 m. Nineteen algae species were identified, most of them are typical inhabitants of salt lakes. Diatoms showed the highest species number (10) but the small chlorophyte Monoraphidium minutum, the single-cell cyanobacteria, Synechocystis aquatilis, and the colonial chlorophyte, Oocystis parva, were the numerical dominant species over the annual cycle. Chlorophytes, small cyanobacteria and diatoms dominated in the circulation period producing a bloom comparable to the spring bloom in temperate lakes. At the end of the circulation and at the beginning of stratification periods, the presence of a bloom of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, N. spumigena, indicated nitrogen-deficit conditions. The well-stratified season was characterized by low epilimnetic nutrients levels and the dominance of small single-cell cyanobacteria and colonial chlorophytes. Phytoplankton dynamics in tropical Lake Alchichica is similar to the pattern observed in some deep, hyposaline, North American temperate lakes.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; Peralta-Soriano, Laura/0000-0002-1853-8234; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2001	466	1-3					299	306		10.1023/A:1014578024049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014578024049													WOS:000174354200027

Subtill nonglacial deposits and their climatic implications for the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e), Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												In Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL), the Wisconsinan tills are often underlain by organic-bearing nonglacial deposits formed during episodes of significant reduction of ice volumes or complete ice-free conditions in this region. The subtill nonglacial deposits, often correlated with the Missinaibi Formation, are beyond the method limit of radiocarbon dating in general. As such, they have been a subject of debates for their stratigraphy and associated climatic conditions owing to poor age constraints. Extensive studies were undertaken on a subtill argillaceous lacustrine deposit uncovered recently on the Winisk River. This 9 m thick organic-rich deposit, referred to as the Webequie Beds, was dated at 121 +/- 9 ka, 126 +/- 24 ka and 105 +/- 11 ka using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating method and correlated with the Last Interglacial (LIG) or Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e. Pollen and plant macrofossils suggest spruce boreal forests along with extensive wetlands, not unlike what exists in the HBL today. Of particular note is the sporadic rise of birch in the upper part of the pollen sequence, interpreted as a response to the availability of frequent forest clearance by fires under a warmer climate. The birch zone is noteworthy because it corresponds to the development of conspicuous S-rich, ferromagnetic nodules (0.125-1.5 mm diameter) in the lake sediment. The nodules comprise native sulphur and greigite (Fe3S4), along with iron oxyhydroxide goethite and lepidocrocite. They likely resulted from significant warming during this interval that enhanced microbial sulphate reduction and increased the release of H2S, an essential component for the formation of the S minerals in the lake. Besides the strengthened microbial metabolization, a prolonged summer lake stratification and development of an anoxic bottom water also likely promoted the sulphate reduction. Although confirmation is needed, the warming probably linked to the LIG thermal maximum (similar to 120 ka) when a climate with a higher summer temperature than today prevailed. A similar subtill nonglacial deposit on the Little Current, a tributary of the Albany River, was also examined for comparison. Apart from a similar pollen flora, S-rich nodules were also recovered near a horizon OSL dated at 118 +/- 13 ka comparable to the LIG thermal maximum. Results of this study provide new insights into the stratigraphy and climatic conditions of the LIG in the HBL but also help better understand the behavior and dynamics of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Late Pleistocene.

The archaeal community in subsurface sediments of ODP Site 1225 in the eastern equatorial Pacific (3760 m water depth; 1.1 and 7.8 m sediment depth) was analyzed by PCR, cloning and sequencing, and by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes. Three uncultured archaeal lineages with different depth distributions were found: Marine Group I (MG-I) within the Thaumarchaeota, its sister lineage Marine Benthic Group A (MBG-A), the phylum-level archaeal lineage Marine Benthic Group B (also known as Deep-Sea Archaeal Group or Lokiarchaeota), and the Deep-Sea Euryarchaeotal Group 3. The MG-I phylotypes included representatives of sediment clusters that are distinct from the pelagic members of this phylum. On the scale from fully oxidized, extremely organic carbon-depleted sediments (for example, those the South Pacific Gyre) to fully reduced, organic carbon-rich marine subsurface sediments (such as those of the Peru Margin), Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1225 falls into the non-extreme organic carbon-lean category, and harbors archaeal communities from both ends of the spectrum.

Occurrence of 874 amphibians, representing 7 spp., is recorded in relation to 4 bog communities. Most abundant foods found in stomachs of 261 amphibians are reported by amphibian spp. and plant zones. These data show similarities for leopard frog, wood frog and swamp-tree frog, but differences for spring peeper. Population estimates based on frogs caught per man-hr. indicate that success of reproduction determined population level in all zones each yr. It is thought that data reported on frog distribution in bog indicate in part effects of micro-climatic influences on frogs; in part influences of cover and life forms of vegetation; and, in part relative abundance of escape facilities for non-breeding frogs.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1955	36	3					381	387		10.2307/1929572	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929572													WOS:A1955WR61800003

Subarctic ponds are seasonal aquatic habitats subject to short summers but often have surprisingly numerous planktonic consumers relative to phytoplankton productivity. Because subarctic ponds have low pelagic productivity but a high biomass of benthic algae, we hypothesised that benthic mats provide a complementary and important food source for the zooplankton. To test this, we used a combination of fatty acid and stable isotope analyses to evaluate the nutritional content of benthic and pelagic food and their contributions to the diets of crustacean zooplankton in 10 Finnish subarctic ponds. 2. Benthic mats and seston differed significantly in total lipids, with seston (62.5 mu g mg(-1)) having approximately eight times higher total lipid concentrations than benthic mats (7.0 mu g mg(-1)). Moreover, the two potential food sources differed in their lipid quality, with benthic organic matter completely lacking some nutritionally important polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), most notably docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid. 3. Zooplankton had higher PUFA concentrations (27-67 mu g mg(-1)) than either of the food sources (mean benthic mats: 1.2 mu g mg(-1); mean seston: 9.9 mu g mg(-1)), indicating that zooplankton metabolically regulate their accumulation of PUFA. In addition, when each pond was evaluated independently, the zooplankton was consistently more C-13-depleted (delta C-13 -20 to -33 parts per thousand) than seston (-23 to -29 parts per thousand) or benthic (-15 to -27 parts per thousand) food sources. In three ponds, a subset of the zooplankton (Eudiaptomus graciloides, Bosmina sp., Daphnia sp. and Branchinecta paludosa) showed evidence of feeding on both benthic and planktonic resources, whereas in most (seven out of 10) ponds the zooplankton appeared to feed primarily on plankton. 4. Our results indicate that pelagic primary production was consistently the principal food resource of most metazoans. While benthic mats were highly productive, they did not appear to be a major food source for zooplankton. The pond zooplankton, faced by strong seasonal food limitation, acquires particular dietary elements selectively.

Here, we use a high-resolution, multi-proxy analysis of a lacustrine sequence located in the lowlands of Transylvania (NW Romania), alongside global climate simulations in order to disentangle the drivers of fire regimes in this dry climatic region of Central-Eastern Europe. Periods of greater fire activity and frequency occurred between 10,700 and 7100 cal yr BP (mean Fire Interval = mFI 112 yr), and between 3300 and 700 cal yr BP (mFI 150 yr), whereas intervals of lower fire activity were recorded between 12,000 and 10,700 cal yr BP (mFI 217 yr), 7100 and 3300 cal yr BP (mFI 317 yr), and over last 700 years (no fire events detected). We found good correlations between simulated early summer (June, July) soil moisture content and near-surface air temperature with fire activity, particularly for the early to mid Holocene. A climate-fire relationship is further supported by local hydrological changes, i.e., lake level and runoff fluctuations. Fuel limitation, as a result of arid and strongly seasonal climatic conditions, led to low fire activity before 10,700 cal yr BP. However, fires were most frequent during climatically drier phases for the remaining, fuel-sufficient, part of the Holocene. Our results also suggest that the occurrence of more frequent fires in the early Holocene has kept woodlands open, promoted grassland abundance and sustained a more flammable ecosystem (mFI < 150 years) whereas the decline in fire risk under cooler and wetter climate conditions (mFI = 317 years) favoured woodland development. From 3300 cal yr BP, human impacts clearly were partly responsible for changes in fire activity, first increasing fire frequency and severity in periods with fire-favourable climatic conditions (halving the mFI from 300 years to about 150 years), then effectively suppressing fires over the last several centuries. Given the projected future temperature increase and moisture decline and the biomass accumulation due to the agricultural land abandonment in the region, natural fire frequency would be expected to return to <150 years.

During low turbidity periods, high phytoplankton biomass can be reached, frequently associated to cyanobacteria blooms, which can cause interferences in the water supply. In this study, we assessed the environmental drivers of cyanobacteria dominance, composition, and nitrogen-fixation behavior. For this, we analyzed the spatial and temporal phytoplankton composition, physical and chemical variables performing weekly samplings during two summers: 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. When inorganic turbidity washigh (above 30 NTU), phytoplankton biomass was controlled, below this threshold, temperature, secchi depth and nutrients played key factors controlling cyanobacteria biomass and composition. Blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria (Dolichospermum crassum, Aphanizomenon gracile, and Cuspidothrix issatschenkoi) were promoted by low N:P ratios (average 11.5) and wide TN range (286-1300 mu gl(-1)). Non-heterocystous cyanobacteria blooms occurred above TN 1000-1200 mu gl(-1). The N-2-fixing behavior (heterocytes:vegetative cell ratio) depended on TN, it was highest at low TN (<700 mu gl(-1)) but null above ca. 1000 mu gl(-1). While low inorganic turbidity allowed cyanobacteria blooms in Laguna del Sauce, its composition and N-2-fixation behavior depended on the TN and TP levels.

Despite a series of comprehensive taxonomic studies carried out in the early 1990s on molluscs in the region, this species was never genetically confirmed in NY. In addition, its invasive potential had never approached that of the notorious zebra and quagga mussels. In this study, we report a new population of V. georgianus from the Adirondacks (northern NY) and genetically confirm its identity for the first time using Bayesian analysis. Based on field observations, we also investigated trematode infection in 200 snails and quantify their prevalence and intensity over four months in the summer of 2016 (May-August). Our results found that V. georgianus serves as the intermediate host of an echinostomatid trematode species with an overall prevalence of 66.7% (N= 177). We discuss the implications of these results within the context of the snail's invasive status in NY and provide a framework for future research on the species.

Oxbow lakes are wetlands of particular sensitivity. Within a large-scale floodplain rehabilitation project in Hungary, the Old Drava Programme, water replenishment was first carried out for the C6n-Szaporca oxbow lakes, a key area in the project. To assess its sustainability, the entire hydrological system has been monitored. From the data of hydrological monitoring (infiltration, soil moisture, groundwater/lakewater interaction) it is claimed that water replenishment involves significant losses through seepage (4.1 and 1.46 mm d(-1)) and evaporation (3.01 and 1.44 mm d(-1)) in the studied pre -intervention and replenishment periods, resp. Infiltration alone is insufficient to replenish groundwater and raise oxbow lake levels. In the critical summer half -year evaporation is intensive in the neighbouring agricultural fields. Groundwater table dynamics are controlled by hyporheic and groundwater flow. Major impact on the water balance of the oxbow lakes is exerted by the regime of the Drava River. A deepened lakebed is recommended to ensure more effective water retention in the oxbow lake. From the local study conclusions are drawn for the feasibility of rehabilitation at floodplain scale and in areas with similar hydromorphological conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Chemical and morphological data from eighteen lakes (meres) in the West Midlands, U.K. were examined to determine the relative importance of nitrogen and phosphorus in determining algal biomass. The meres are characterised by high phosphorus concentrations, with mean annual total phosphorus in excess of 300mug/l. A comparison of indicators of nutrient limitation (absolute nutrient concentrations, nutrient ratios, nutrient enrichment bioassays and heterocyst numbers) sometimes showed contradictory results confirming the necessity for the use of multiple indicators on repeated sampling occasions. Five of the meres showed strong evidence for nitrogen limitation, while two meres showed strong evidence of phosphorus limitation. A number of the meres showed temporal variation in nutrient limitation and were not clearly limited by a single nutrient. We examined the extent to which high phosphorus within epilimnion waters during summer is a function of deoxygenation of the hypolimnion and long water residence times. No relationship was found and we surmise that the high phosphorus concentrations generally found within the meres are the accumulative effects of historic land use.

A total of 18 taxa was found, of which three had not been recorded previously from Svalbard. The influence of water chemistry and physical variables on the distribution and abundance of the modern chironomid assemblages was investigated using correspondence analysis and multiple regression. The chironomid assemblages fall into four groups, which are primarily influenced by pH, nutrient concentrations, water temperature, and water depth. Sediment cores were taken from three lakes to investigate changes in chironomid assemblages over the last 700 years. At two of the sites there is evidence for a response to regional climatic change occurring about 200 years ago and may have been associated with the 'Little Ice Age'. At the third site there is a response to local catchment changes, probably brought about, initially, by the establishment of a human settlement close to the lake 70 years ago, and subsequently, as a result of the abandonment of this settlement in 1988.

J	Mir, RA; Jeelani, G; Dar, FA				Mir, Riyaz Ahmad; Jeelani, Gh; Dar, Farooq Ahmad			Spatio-temporal patterns and factors controlling the hydrogeochemistry of the river Jhelum basin, Kashmir Himalaya	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												River Jhelum is a major source of water for growing population and irrigation in the Kashmir Himalaya. The region is trending towards water scarcity as well as quality deterioration stage due to its highly unregulated development. The existence of few literature on various aspects of the basin prompts us to study the spatio-temporal variability of its physicochemical parameters and thereby to understand the regulating hydrogeochemical mechanisms based on 50 samples collected during high flow (June 2008) and low flow (January 2009) periods. The water chemistry exhibited significant spatial variability reflecting the mixing processes in the basin. The seasonal effect does change the concentration of ions significantly with modest variability in the order of ionic abundance. The Ca2+ ion among cations and HCO3- ion among anions dominate the ionic budget and correlates significantly with the diverse lithology of the basin. Three major water types, i.e., Ca-Mg-HCO3 (72 %), Ca-HCO3 (12 %), and Mg-Ca-HCO3 (16 %), suggest that the chemical composition of water is dominantly controlled by carbonate lithology, besides a significant contribution from silicates. However, at certain sites, the biological processes and anthropogenic activities play a major role. Relatively, the lower ionic concentration during high flow period (summer season) suggested the significant influence of higher discharge via dilution effect. The higher discharge due to higher rainfall and snow melting in response to rising temperature in this period leads to strong flushing of human and agricultural wastes into the river. The factor analysis also reflected the dominant control of varied lithology and anthropogenic sources on the water quality based on the four significant factors explaining collectively about 70-81 % of the total data variance. A two-member chloride mixing model used to estimate the discharge contribution of tributaries to the main river channel showed reliable results. It may be mentioned that the regular and continuous contamination through anthropogenic sources is likely to jeopardize and degrade the water quality in the near future. Thus, critical management approaches and strategies are very imperative for its future sustainability.					; Dar, Farooq/AFP-8458-2022; Jeelani, Gh/KII-0203-2024	DAR, FAROOQ AHMAD/0000-0002-2897-7804; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2016	188	7							438	10.1007/s10661-016-5429-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5429-6								27351186					WOS:000378840300055

Summer methane ebullition from a headwater catchment in Northeastern Siberia	INLAND WATERS												Streams and rivers are active processors of terrestrial carbon and significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Recent studies suggest that ebullition may represent a sizable yet overlooked component of the total CH4 flux from these systems; however, there are no published CH4 ebullition estimates for streams or rivers in subarctic or arctic biomes, regions that store vast quantities of vulnerable, old organic carbon in permafrost soils. We quantified CH4 ebullition from headwater streams in a small arctic watershed in Northeastern Siberia. Ebullitive emissions were 0.64 mmol m(-2) d(-1), which is lower than the global average but approximately 2 times greater than the pan-arctic diffusive CH4 flux estimate reported in a recent synthesis of global freshwater CH4 emissions. The high CO2: CH4 of sediment bubbles (0.52) suggests that methane emissions may currently be constrained by resource competition between methanogens and microbes using more efficient metabolic strategies. Furthermore, the magnitude and frequency of ebullition events were greater as temperatures increased, suggesting that ebullition from streams could become a more prominent component of the regional CH4 flux in a warmer future.					; Spawn, Seth/K-4081-2019; Zimov, Nikita/JCO-9342-2023	Dunn, Samuel/0000-0003-0629-9595; Spawn-Lee, Seth/0000-0001-8821-5345; Zimov, Nikita/0000-0003-1577-1521													2044-2041	2044-205X					2015	5	3					224	230		10.5268/IW-5.3.845	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-5.3.845													WOS:000358848300003

Inferring the magmatic roots of volcano-geothermal systems in the Rotorua Caldera and Okataina Volcanic Centre from magnetotelluric models	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												To investigate the underlying magmatic systems that drive high-temperature geothermal fields and volcanism in the north-central Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), we use a combination of land and lake-bottom magnetotelluric (MT) measurements. In total, MT data from 399 sites (including 34 lake-bottom locations) across 2800 km(2) covering the Rotorua Caldera and Okataina Volcanic Centre are inverted to image the 3-D resistivity structure of the crust to 20 km depth. Beneath this region, a singular conductive zone in the mid-crust is shown, inferred to represent a complex of relatively mafic magma, consistent with petrologic and other geophysical data. Discrete low-resistivity (conductive) plumes rise from the margins of this magmatic complex and connect 1-to-1 with the locations of high-temperature geothermal fields at the surface. These plumes are inferred to represent pathways of heat transfer through the crust via magmatic intrusion and exsolved saline fluids, and inform connections with other geothermal areas located nearby to the major fields. An additional conductive plume rises beneath the area where the most voluminous recent volcanism has occurred in the Okataina Volcanic Centre; the summit region (e.g. Makatiti dome) in the Haroharo Volcanic Complex that has erupted 39 km(3) (magma equivalent) in the past 9 ka. While hot springs locate around this conductive plume at the base of the rhyolite domes, the plume itself is arrested at 1-2 km depth beneath the resistive (inferred impermeable) young (5 ka old) rhyolite lava domes, and is considered to represent a deep 'blind' geothermal system in the TVZ.

In exploring the nature of these features we consider their morphology, albedo, and specular reflectivity. We suggest that they represent candidates for potential temperate lakes. The presence of lakes at the mid-latitudes would indicate that surface liquid can accumulate and remain stable away from Titan's poles. Candidate lakes were identified by looking for possible shorelines with "lacustrine morphology. Then, we applied an atmospheric correction that empirically solved for their surface albedo. Finally, we looked for a specular reflection of the sky in the identified candidates. Using this prescription, we find two candidates that remain as potential temperature lakes. If candidate features do represent temperate lakes on Titan, they have implications for formation mechanisms such as clouds and rainfall or, in low elevation areas, percolation and subsurface flow. Clouds were observed near candidate lake locations on the T66 flyby and this latitude band showed many clouds during southern summer. Our techniques can be applied to areas of Titan that lack RADAR coverage to search for mid- and low-latitude lakes in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wacker, A; von Elert, E				Wacker, A; von Elert, E			Food quality controls reproduction of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)	OECOLOGIA												Species such as Dreissena polymorpha sometimes contribute substantially in the transfer of primary to secondary production. During the ontogenetic cycle, the reproductive investment of adult mussels is one of the main parameters that affect recruitment success. We studied how food quality and temperature affect the reproductive investment in term of egg mass of D. polymorpha in a lake by sampling mussels monthly from 4 m and 15 m depths. Temperature affected reproduction directly and also indirectly through the food. To assess whether temperature and/or food conditions led to the differences observed in mussels sampled from the two depths, mussels were reared in the laboratory under two different temperature regimes for 3 months, simulating the temperature of the lake at 4 m and 15 m depth. Possible effects of food quality were tested at each temperature using four diets differing in fatty acid composition. Temperature played an important role as a trigger for spawning, and the type of diet clearly affected the reproductive investment. When the heterokont chromophyte alga Nannochloropsis limnetica, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and long-chained PUFAs (>C18), was fed to mussels, an increased egg mass was obtained. This result was in contrast to that found when the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus and the cyanobacterium Aphanothece sp., both of which are deficient in long-chained PUFAs, were offered as food to the mussels. Such a PUFA-dependent food quality may affect reproduction in lakes. Food quality effects vary seasonally in a lake and may be most important in summer, when low-food-quality green algae and cyanobacteria are abundant. The low biochemical quality of these blooms may affect at least the later period of gametogenesis of D. polymorpha, which reproduces from June to August.

Here, we present a reconstruction of changes in vegetation and precipitation during the YD event, based on pollen data from two well-dated, parallel sediment cores (TC2 and GQ2) from Tianchi Crater Lake in NE China. The elevated tree pollen abundance during the YD indicates an abrupt shift from steppe to forest, and therefore wetter conditions in Northeast China. Also, a pollen-based quantitative climatic reconstruction suggests that the climate was significantly colder and wetter, with a 3-5 degrees C decrease in annual temperature (Tann) and a 200 mm increase in annual precipitation (Pann) during the YD. To characterize the spatial distribution of moisture conditions in NE China during the YD, we also compiled 26 records from 14 sites in the region. Based on well-dated proxies, we conclude that the YD throughout northern NE China was characterized by wet conditions-significantly different from the consensus of a dry YD in southern NE China. We propose that the increased precipitation in northern NE China during the YD was a response to the strengthening of the Okhotsk High.

Ecological connectivity shapes quasispecies structure of RNA viruses in an Antarctic lake	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												RNA viruses exist as complex mixtures of genotypes, known as quasispecies, where the evolution potential resides in the whole community of related genotypes. Quasispecies structure and dynamics have been studied in detail for virus infecting animals and plants but remain unexplored for those infecting micro-organisms in environmental samples. We report the first metagenomic study of RNA viruses in an Antarctic lake (Lake Limnopolar, Livingston Island). Similar to low-latitude aquatic environments, this lake harbours an RNA virome dominated by positive single-strand RNA viruses from the order Picornavirales probably infecting micro-organisms. Antarctic picorna-like virus 1 (APLV1), one of the most abundant viruses in the lake, does not incorporate any mutation in the consensus sequence from 2006 to 2010 and shows stable quasispecies with low-complexity indexes. By contrast, APLV2-APLV3 are detected in the lake water exclusively in summer samples and are major constituents of surrounding cyanobacterial mats. Their quasispecies exhibit low complexity in cyanobacterial mat, but their run-off-mediated transfer to the lake results in a remarkable increase of complexity that may reflect the convergence of different viral quasispecies from the catchment area or replication in a more diverse host community. This is the first example of viral quasispecies from natural aquatic ecosystems and points to ecological connectivity as a modulating factor of quasispecies complexity.					; Alcami, Antonio/F-8512-2015; Arenas, Miguel/C-4831-2009; Rastrojo, Alberto/N-4607-2014	Lopez-Bueno, Alberto/0000-0002-6324-8623; Peiro-Pastor, Ramon/0000-0003-2450-2999; Alcami, Antonio/0000-0002-3333-6016; Arenas, Miguel/0000-0002-0516-2717; Rastrojo, Alberto/0000-0003-4381-7267													0962-1083	1365-294X				OCT	2015	24	19					4812	4825		10.1111/mec.13321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.13321								26198078					WOS:000362194900002

Young (< 7Ma), economically viable epithermal Au deposits are closely associated with some modern, presumably amagmatic geothermal systems. This close spatial association of the Au deposits to the modern geothermal systems has led to speculation of an amagmatic origin for the deposits and that the modern geothermal systems could be actively precipitating Au in the subsurface. In an effort to clarify the possible role of amagmatic geothermal systems as the source of young to modern epithermal Au mineralization, noble gas and fluid chemistry samples were collected from active, amagmatic geothermal systems in Nevada (Wabuska, San Emidio, Brady Hot Springs, Humboldt House [Florida Canyon], and Soda Lake) as well as modern magmatic geothermal systems in California (Clear Lake, Wilber Springs, Lassen Volcanic National Park and Mammoth Mountain). Calculated silica geothermometery on the fluids from the Nevada geothermal systems agrees well with the measured down-hole temperatures from the reservoirs. The calculated reservoir temperatures of these systems span the range of 150 to 210 degrees C, except Wabuska which yields a temperature of 135 degrees C. Noble gas compositions from both magmatic or amagmatic systems are characterized by atmospherically derived components that have mixed with deeper non-atmospheric sources. Helium isotopic data, after correction for atmospheric components (excess He), shows a dominance of crustal helium (87 to 97 percent of the excess He component) supporting an amagmatic origin, except in the case of the Soda Lake, where almost 54 to 59 percent of the excess He is mantle derived. Comparison of the He data with Au concentrations in fluid samples shows a positive correlation between gold and the mantle helium content in both the magmatic and amagmatic systems. This relationship is at odds with current theories that the modern, amagmatic geothermal systems are responsible for substantial Au transport that resulted in the spatially associated young epithermal deposits. This postulate is further supported from noble and bulk gas compositions from fluid inclusions in silica precipitates from Florida Canyon and Dixie Valley.																					978-1-60595-040-2				2011							899	+																WOS:000293810500049

The climate of the Atlantic period (7500-4500 yr ago) was relatively arid, indicating that Lake Telmen lay beyond the region of enhanced precipitation delivered by the expanded Asian monsoon. Maximum humidity is recorded between similar to4500 and 1600 cal yr B.P., during the Subboreal (4500-2500 yr ago) and early Subatlantic (2500 yr-present) periods. Additional humid intervals during the Medieval Warm Epoch (similar to1000-1300 A.D. or 950-650 ago) and the Little Ice Age (1500-1900 A.D. or 450-50 yr B.P.) demonstrate the lack of long-term correlation between temperature and moisture availability in this region. A brief aridification centered around 1410 cal yr B.P. encompasses a decade of cold temperatures and summer frost between A.D. 536 and 545 (1414-1405 yr B.P.) inferred from records of Mongolian tree-ring widths. These data suggest that steppe vegetation of the Lake Telmen region is sensitive to centennial- and decadal-scale climatic perturbations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Application of Passive Microwave Data in Estimating Freeze-Thaw Dates of a Small Lake	2009 IEEE RADAR CONFERENCE, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE Radar Conference				2009 IEEE Radar Conference	MAY 04-08, 2009	Pasadena, CA	IEEE, IEEE Coastal, Los Angeles Sect, JPL, GRSS, MTT S, aess				Our method uses coarse resolution passive microwave data to estimate freeze-thaw dates of soil in the region surrounding the lake. Using the soil freeze-thaw dates we then determine a high probability 'window' of days during which the lake freeze-thaw dates may occur. This paper mainly focuses on using passive microwave data to estimate this high probability window of days for the freeze and the thaw seasons of a lake. The importance of this project in our broader research goal of estimating freeze-thaw dates for small lakes can be explained as follows. Given a classifier that can classify SAR images of small lakes into 'ice' and 'no-ice' images (a parallel research project that we are involved in), we demonstrate that using passive microwave data to estimate the 'window' will improve the practical use of the classifier in detecting freeze-thaw dates of the lake, by reducing the number of datasets required (using only the datasets that fall within the window). By reducing the number of SAR datasets required for the algorithm we reduce both financial and computational cost of the classification algorithm. This in turn will make the method more affordable and improve the usability of the classification algorithm to keep track of lake freeze-thaw dates for a larger number of lakes. The passive microwave data collected, results obtained till date and related literature will be discussed in this paper.

Measurements made with certain gas-vacuolate bacteria in laboratory culture suggest that only colonial forms could sink or float fast enough to form population maxima in lakes by vertical migration from other depths. In the case of individual cells the importance of the buoyancy provided by gas vacuoles is to minimize sinking rates and increase residence times of the organisms at depths where conditions support their growth. Changes in the vertical distribution of a number of gas-vacuolate bacteria were followed throughout the year in a monomictic, eutrophic lake (Crose Mere, Shropshire [UK]). All were restricted to the anaerobic hypolimnion which developed in summer. The various species formed maxima at different depths and times. With some of them (e.g., Thiopedia, Pelonema and Brachyarcus spp.) growth was necessary to explain their development. In others (e.g., Pelodictyon spp. and 2 colorless bacteria) vertical migrations might also have contributed to their development.																			0302-8933	1432-072X					1978	118	3					229	233		10.1007/BF00429110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00429110													WOS:A1978FP62900002

In total, 47 food items were identified in their diets including remains of fish and invertebrates. Sixteen prey items were identified in pike diet including 15 fish species; 33 prey items in European catfish diet, among which 20 fish species; 21 prey items in pikeperch diet, among which 18 fish species; and 28 prey items in perch diet, among which 12 fish species. The most important prey for pike were roach, Rutilus rutilus (%IRI = 25.9 %), Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio (34.7 %), and perch (18.4 %); for catfish - roach (55.5 %) and perch (20.6 %); for pikeperch - roach (52.8 %) and perch (34.1 %); and for perch - monkey goby, Neogobius fluviatilis (85.7 %). Highest diet overlap indices were observed between catfish and pikeperch (84.8 %) while the lowest between catfish and perch (33.7 %). No significant difference was observed between the average sizes of fish prey in the stomachs of pikeperch and European catfish (t-test, P > 0.05), but there were significant differences between all other pairs of piscivorous species (t-test, P < 0.001).

Does mercury biomagnification in a boreal lake food web vary year-round? - A comparison using bulk δ15N and compound-specific δ15N of amino acids	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Seasonality characterises northern latitude lakes, however, limited knowledge exists regarding seasonal fluctuations in mercury (Hg) biomagnification. This study tested for these fluctuations year-round in the food web of a boreal humic lake (Lake Pa<spacing diaeresis>a<spacing diaeresis>ja<spacing diaeresis>rvi, in southern Finland) and for differences between two methods of trophic level (TL) determination. A food web sample was collected in three open-water seasons and one ice-covered season. TL was calculated using bulk nitrogen stable isotopes (delta 15N) and compound-specific stable isotope analysis of delta 15N in amino acids (CSIA-AA). Biomagnification of total Hg (THg), measured through the linear regression of THg (log10[THg]) and TLs, was detected in all seasons using both isotope methods. No significant differences in seasonal trophic magnification slope (TMS), the slope of the linear regression, in- and between methods were found. However, [THg] baseline estimates, the intercept of the linear regression, were significantly different between methods when comparing the same seasons. [THg] baseline values were generally higher in all seasons in bulk delta 15N than CSIA-AA. Results highlight relatively stable biomagnification among seasons in both methods, however, direct comparisons of bulk delta 15N and CSIA-AA TLs require further methodological development.					; Taipale, Sami/AAO-3492-2020	Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Megyeri, Eszter/0009-0006-0751-5316; Piro, Alexander/0000-0002-6190-843X													0269-7491	1873-6424				MAY 1	2025	372								125933	10.1016/j.envpol.2025.125933	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2025.125933		MAR 2025						40020903					WOS:001441949800001

Reservoirs are anthropogenically-dominated ecosystems because hydropower operations induce artificial water level fluctuations (WLF) that exceed natural fluctuations in frequency and amplitude. These WLF have detrimental ecological effects, which can be quantified as losses to ecosystem primary production due to lake bottoms that fall dry. To allow for a sustainable development of hydropower, these ecological costs of WLF need to be weighed against the economic benefits of hydropower that can balance and store intermittent renewable energy. We designed an economic hydropower operation model to derive WLF in large and small reservoirs for three different future energy market scenarios and quantified the according losses in ecosystem primary production in semi-natural outdoor experiments. Our results show that variations in market conditions affect WLF differently in small and large hydropower reservoirs and that increasing price volatility magnified WLF and reduced primary production. Our model allows an assessment of the trade-off between the objectives of preserving environmental resources and economic development, which lies at the core of emerging sustainability issues.

Influences of local weather, large-scale climatic drivers, and the ca. 11 year solar cycle on lake ice breakup dates; 1905-2004	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We investigate the temporal patterns in inter-annual variability in ice breakup dates for Lakes Mendota and Monona, Wisconsin, between 1905 and 2004. We analyze the contributions of long-term trends attributed to climate change, local weather, indices of sunspots, and large-scale climatic drivers, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El NiAo Southern Ocean Index (ENSO) on time series of lake-ice breakup. The relative importance of the aforementioned explanatory variables was assessed using linear regression and variation partitioning models accounting for cyclic temporal dynamics as represented by Moran Eigenvector Maps (MEM). Model results explain an average of 58 % of the variation in ice breakup dates. A combination of the long-term linear trends, rain and snowfall in the month prior to breakup, air temperature in the winter prior to breakup, cyclic dynamics associated with sunspot numbers, ENSO, and for Lake Mendota, NAO, all significantly influence the timing of ice breakup. Significant cycle lengths were 3.5, 9, 11, and 50 years. Despite their proximity, Lakes Mendota and Monona exhibit differences in how and which explanatory variables were incorporated into the models. Our results indicate that lake ice dynamics are complex in both lakes and multiple interacting processes explain the residuals around the linear warming trends that characterize lake ice records.					; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				JUN	2013	118	3-4					857	870		10.1007/s10584-012-0670-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0670-7													WOS:000319418300027

During storm events in autumn 1988 lake water samples were collected every 2-8 hours by an automatic sampler at a mid-lake station. The concentration of suspended solids and Tot-P was found to increase markedly. During storms up to 2 cm of the superficial sediment was resuspended, and the concentration of resuspended solids in the water column rose to 140 mg l-1. The resuspended particles had a relatively high settling velocity and on average, a relatively short residence time in the water column of 7 hours. A model which describes the concentration of resuspended solids as a function of wind velocity and of settling velocity of the resuspended particles is presented. Using additional wind velocity data from a nearby meteorological station, the model has been used to calculate the frequency of resuspension events and concentration of resuspended solids for the period from May to November 1988. These calculations show that resuspension occurred about 50% of the time. Average flux of suspended solids from the sediment to the water was 300 g m-2 d-1 and during 50% of the time lake water concentration of suspended solids was more than 32 mg l-1. A relationship between concentration of suspended solids and Secchi-depth is presented. Because of resuspension, Secchi-depth in Lake Arreso is reduced to 0.5 m. Resuspension also had a marked effect on Tot-P concentration in the lake water, and P input to the lake water being totally dominated by resuspension events.

The subaerial evolution and the transition from subaerial to subaqueous conditions can strongly control the landslide evolution and the generated impulse waves, and consequently the final hazard zonation. We intend to model the landslide spreading, the impact with the water surface and the generation of the impulse wave under different 2D and 3D conditions and settings. We verify the capabilities of a fully 2D and 3D FEM ALE approach to model and analyse near-field evolution. To this aim we validate the code against 2D laboratory experiments for different Froude number conditions (Fr = 1.4, 3.2). Then the Vajont rockslide (Fr = 0.26-0.75) and the consequent impulse wave are simulated in 2D and 3D. The sliding mass is simulated as an elasto-plastic Mohr-Coulomb material and the lake water as a fully inviscid low compressibility fluid. The rockslide model is validated against field observations, including the total duration, the profile and internal geometry of the final deposit, the maximum water run-up on the opposite valley flank and on the rockslide mass. 2D models are presented for both the case of a dry valley and that of the impounded lake. The set of fully 3D simulations are the first ones available and considering the rockslide evolution, propagation and interaction with the water reservoir. Advantages and disadvantages of the modelling approach are discussed.

Fourth instar larvae were collected in winter in a glacio-rhithral stream (1300 m a.s.l., Alps, NE-Italy) and their respiration rate was measured with a Clark's electrode in the range 0-14 degrees C. The respiration rate was significantly higher in D. insignipes than in P. branickii at low temperatures (<= 4 degrees C), higher in P. branickii between 8 and 12 degrees C and comparable at 14 degrees C, Higher values of R (regulation value), R-25% (respiration rate at 25% oxygen saturation) and b(1)/b(2) (slope ratio in piecewise linear regression), and lower values of Pc (critical pressure) and I (initial decrease) were recorded in P. branickii than in D. insignipes. These Value., are compatible with oxy-regulatory behaviour in P. branickii, whereas D. insignipes appeared to be almost an oxy-conformer. On the basis of this autoecological information, new implications regarding Survival of species from cold, high altitude habitats under changing climatic conditions are made.

Recent major floods in July 2008 record were caused by precipitation levels of 68 mm in 24 hours, and a monthly accumulation of 146 mm. Hundreds of homes and industrial enterprises were flooded. Nine vertical electrical soundings (VES) were conducted utilizing a Schlumberger array to generate a geologic model. Two trenches were excavated to calibrated the method and perform permeability tests. The method successfully discriminated between fine grained clay and silt and coarse sand. The subsurface sand body will be used as a temporary storage facility for flood control during summer storms amounting to up to half the total annual rainfall.																			0016-7169					JUL-SEP	2012	51	3					225	249																WOS:000306150900003

Habitat-specific stability and persistence of benthic invertebrate communities in boreal lakes	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The persistence and stability of invertebrate communities of three benthic habitats (littoral, sublittoral, profundal) over 16 years were compared between minimally disturbed (reference) and disturbed (acidified) boreal lakes. No significant differences were found for either persistence or stability and degree of disturbance, although clear differences in community composition existed between the two lake groups. Differences in mean persistence and stability were found between the three benthic habitats. Profundal habitats showed the highest and littoral habitats the lowest communnity persistence and stability. Correlation of both metrics with water chemistry and the NAO(winter) index showed generally negative relationships with climate and pH, but positive relationships with water color (minimally disturbed) and TOC (acidified). Littoral invertebrate assemblages had lower persistence and stability compared to invertebrate assemblages in environmentally more "simple" habitats such as the profundal. Our results support the idea that complex habitats having high interannual variability are less suitable for monitoring due to the high probability of not detecting change if/when it occurs. These findings have strong implications for the design of lake bioassessment programs, emphasizing the importance of habitat stratification.

However, since 1996, these blooms became irregular, failing to develop in 10 out of the past 16 years. During the later period, a significant correlation (R (2) = 0.605, P = 0.013) was found between annual peak P. gatunense biomass and riverine inflow volume. In-lake surveys showed that patches of high P. gatunense densities were associated with water enriched with fresher inflowing Jordan River water. Supplementing laboratory cultures of P. gatunense with Hula Valley water stimulated its growth relative to un-enriched controls. A likely explanation to the recent irregular blooms of this dinoflagellate is a hydrological modification that was made in the catchment in the mid-1990s, preventing Hula Valley water from reaching Lake Kinneret in most years-except for exceptionally wet years. We propose that until the mid-1990s, the Jordan River water enriched Lake Kinneret with a growth factor (a microelement and/or organic compound) originating in the Hula Valley, which in recent years has arrived in sufficient quantities to support a bloom only in high-rainfall years.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2012	698	1					161	174		10.1007/s10750-012-1145-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1145-6													WOS:000309345700013

Here, we used variation partitioning to quantify the relative effects of environmental (water parameters), biotic (abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton) and spatial (geographic distance) factors on cyanobacteria distribution, using taxonomic (species and order levels) and functional (Reynolds Functional Groups and life form) approaches in a coastal lake system (southern Brazil). Cyanobacteria distribution was affected by all factors, but mainly by environmental conditions. Overall, environmental and biotic factors were more important in shaping the cyanobacterial distribution using a taxonomic approach than using a functional-group approach. Filamentous cyanobacteria (both heterocystous and non-heterocystous) were influenced mainly by the environmental variables, and coccoid species by the spatial fraction. Our results demonstrate that taxonomic and functional approaches may reflect different responses to ecological factors, thus being complementary for a better understanding of cyanobacterial distribution patterns in lake systems.

The water depth, water temperature and electrical conductivity of the water were continuously measured during this period. The measurements were obtained with a CTD DIVER (Schlumberger Water Services). The instrument was fixed at the bottom of Blue Lake, which means that all the measured data refer to a single point of measurement. The data represent the first systematic and continuous monitoring of the hydrological parameters of this fascinating karst phenomenon. The hydrological analysis also involved daily rainfall data and daily mean air temperatures recorded at the nearby Imotski meteorological station. The rate of water level rise and fall and the hourly and daily average inflow and outflow into and from the lake were calculated using the available data. The analysis led to the conclusion that Blue Lake is mainly recharged by water coming from the karst aquifer, the dimensions and the characteristics of which have not yet been adequately studied.

New red pine chronologies were combined with existing chronologies to extend the ring-width record both into the past and into the present. Ring-width response to climate, assessed using correlation analysis and response functions, was broadly similar among all three species with relatively significant positive relationships with June July precipitation and significant negative (but less consistent) associations with June July temperatures (p < 0.05). White-cedar appeared to have a broader phenological window of response with a stronger spring influence when compared to other species included in this study. Comparisons with other nearby proxies showed relatively strong coherence overall but with some important regional differences. Overall, these species may be useful for placing current climatic patterns in the Boundary Waters within a longer term perspective but care should be taken with respect to identifying appropriate climatic records for calibration.					; Salzer, Matthew/AAG-1405-2019	Salzer, Matthew/0000-0001-5353-7459; Larson, Evan/0000-0001-6628-1659; 													1536-1098	2162-4585					2010	66	2					113	126		10.3959/2009-12.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3959/2009-12.1													WOS:000278493700004

A multidisciplinary approach was employed, integrating elemental analysis, health risk assessment, and source identification techniques to evaluate the distribution, sources, and health risks of PTE contamination in fish. The mean concentrations of toxic and trace elements (mu g/ kg) were determined in ascending order: Cd (5) G Co (8) G Cr (18) = Pb (18) G Ni (66) G As (163) G Cu (290) G Mn (798) G Fe (6150) G Zn (6250). In contrast, the concentrations of macro elements are provided in units of mg/kg, as follows: Mg (391) G Na (677) G Ca (1698) G P (2314) G K (3837), with notable variations across species. Health risk assessment methodologies indicated that PTE levels in fish muscle tissues generally fell below regulatory limits, indicating their safety for consumption. Noncarcinogenic risk assessment further documented the safety of consuming these fish species, with elevated maximum safe consumption quantity (MSCQ) values observed for all metals. In addition, the estimated daily intake of PTEs was found to be below reference doses, confirming the safety of consumption. Esox lucius demonstrated a highest abundance of essential nutrients (e.g., Ca, K, Mg, and P). Source identification techniques indicated that residential waste, lithogenic materials, and agricultural practices are significant contributors to PTE contamination. Overall, this research stresses the importance of monitoring PTE levels in fish, ensuring food safety and protect human health.

On the Diversity and Morphology of Anserini (Aves: Anatidae) from the Late Miocene of Western Mongolia	PALEONTOLOGICAL JOURNAL												New previously unstudied geese bones (two coracoids and tarsometatarsus) are described from the late Miocene locality Hyargas Nuur 2 in Western Mongolia. A tarsometatarsus, previously unknown for Anser devjatkini Kurochkin, 1971, indicates close phylogenetic relationships of this extinct species with modern grey geese. Previously noted similarity with white geese is treated as plesiomorphic. Morphological transition from white to grey geese thus was associated with changes in locomotor specialization of the hind limb (swimming versus running adaptations). Two coracoids are different from those in modern Anser and Branta, but are close to "Branta" woolfendeni Bickart, 1990 from the late Miocene of Arizona (USA), from which they differ in their bigger size. These latter finds represent a distinct extinct unnamed genus of geese, which was widespread across Central Asia and North America in the late Miocene. Late Miocene evolution and paleogeography of geese is further discussed. The remarkable diversity of geese at the Hyargas Nuur locality (at least 3-4 species) may be explained by wintering of these birds on the large lakes of Central Asia.

J	Koch, RW; Guelda, DL; Bukaveckas, PA				Koch, RW; Guelda, DL; Bukaveckas, PA			Phytoplankton growth in the Ohio, Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers, USA: inter-site differences in light and nutrient limitation	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Seasonal patterns in resource limitation of phytoplankton growth were assessed monthly within three large rivers with differing extents of water regulation. The Ohio River is regulated by low dams that do not substantially modify discharge, while the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers are impounded by a series of high dams to enhance water storage for downstream flood control. Laboratory dilution assays with light and nutrient manipulations indicated that light was the main factor limiting phytoplankton growth at irradiances below 7 E m(-2) d(-1). Light limited growth was frequent in the turbid, higher discharge of the Ohio River, but was rare in the heavily regulated Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. When irradiance exceeded 7 E m(-2) d(-1), phytoplankton were either P-limited (Cumberland River), co-limited by P and N (Tennessee River), or Si limited (Ohio River). Site-specific differences in nutrient limitation were consistent with differences in ambient nutrient levels, with the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers characterized by lower N and P concentrations, and the Ohio River by lower Si. Downstream nutrient depletion was evident in the Ohio River through comparison of an upstream and a downstream site, with nutrient limitation (Si) occurring more frequently downstream. Phytoplankton growth rates at ambient light and nutrient levels ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 d(-1) in the Ohio River and 0.2 to 0.6 d(-1) in the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. Growth rates were greatest at the onset of the summer base pool, as light intensities increased and nutrient levels were maximal. Our findings indicate that multiple factors regulate phytoplankton growth in regulated rivers and that spatial complexity may arise from differences in discharge and water aging.

J	PENTECOST, A; VILES, H				PENTECOST, A; VILES, H			A REVIEW AND REASSESSMENT OF TRAVERTINE CLASSIFICATION	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												This paper provides a review of the classification of travertines with emphasis on their morphology. Three criteria are used to describe them: geochemistry, microfabric and morphology. Geochemically, travertines may be divided into two groups, the meteogene travertines, where the carrier carbon dioxide originates in the soil and epigean atmosphere, and the thermal (thermogene travertines where the carbon dioxide comes from thermally generated sources. Many travertine fabrics are influenced by bacteria and plants. These include 'stromatolitic' forms, many oncoids, shrubs, tufts, mats and moss travertines. Morphologically, travertines are conveniently divided into autochthonous (spring mounds and ridges, cascades, barrages, fluvial and lacustrine crusts, paludal deposits and cemented rudites) and the allochthonous or clastic travertines (valley-fills, back-barrage deposits, alluvial cones). Travertine deposits often include a wide range of fabrics and morphologies in one system. They are influenced locally by discharge, slope, vegetation, climate and human activity. Intergradations occur, both within travertine types but also with other freshwater deposits, e.g. calcrete and lake chalk. The influence of travertine deposition on the local hydrology and geomorphology is also discussed. The review emphasises the significance of scale and hydrology and aims to provide a unified scheme of travertine classification.																			0705-7199						1994	48	3					305	314		10.7202/033011ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/033011ar													WOS:A1994QD18200008

Larval survival was low on foliage of Lagenaria siceraria (Mol.) Standl., the white-flowered gourd. Larvae were able to develop on bean flowers and fruit [Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Blue Lake] and tomato fruit [Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Walter]. In laboratory choice tests, larvae preferred cucumber foliage to foliage of PI 269480, PI 302418 and Lagenaria siceraria but readily accepted whole plants of the former 2 entries. Survival of newly hatched larvae was low on small Butternut squash plants [Cucurbita moschata Poir.]. In large cage oviposition tests, the most eggs were laid on Early Yellow Summer Crookneck [C. pepo L.] and fewest on Carolina cucumber [Cucumis sativus L.] and PI 169399. Watermelon [Citrullus vulgaris (Shrad.) cv. Charleston Gray] was least preferred for oviposition in a field test.																			0013-8746	1938-2901					1981	74	1					96	99		10.1093/aesa/74.1.96	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/74.1.96													WOS:A1981LP17000019

The concentrations of arsenic species were determined in Lake Kahokugata. During the all season, the inorganic arsenic was detected. while the dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA) appeared in only winter seasons, and MMAA was not detected. Moreover, when DMAA was added to the water samples of Lake Kahokugata collected at every month from June in 2005 to November in 2006, the DMAA in the sample water of all seasons decreased and was converted to inorganic arsenic until the 28th day Of incubation. According to the Most Probable Number (MPN) procedure, the DMAA-degrading bacteria were detected at cell densities ranged from 120 cells/mL to 2 100 cells/mL during the all season. These facts Suggested that the lake water Of all season in Lake Kahokugata possessed the microbial activities for DMAA decomposition. To determine the composition of DMAA-degrading bacteria, the total 352 isolates obtained as dominated bacterial species were analyzed by the restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of 16S rDNA genes. As a result, total 352 isolates were classified into 10 types of which the rates of total isolate numbers indicated seasonal changes. The diverse compositions of DMAA-degrading bacteria would seasonally change and control the organoarsenic degradation contributing 10 the seasonal arsenic cycles in Kahokugata.

Free-living bacteria accounted for most of the total bacterial production during the first part of the bloom. Their production had a significant positive correlation to chlorophyll (P < .01) and polysaccharide concentration (P < .02) and to potential beta-glucosidase and aminopeptidase activity (P < .05), suggesting that algal release of dissolved polymeric compounds provided an important carbon source for bacterial production, As the bloom collapsed, we observed a change in the activity and structure of the microbial community. The mean contribution of attached bacteria to total bacterial production increased from 12% during the first part of the bloom to 26% at the end. Also, the extracellular enzymatic activity of attached bacteria increased as the bloom collapsed and constituted up to 75% of the total hydrolytic activity. An estimated disparity between hydrolytic activity and the corresponding carbon demand of attached bacteria suggested a net release of dissolved organic compounds from organic particles via polymer hydrolysis by attached bacteria.

Both summer epilimnetic total phosphorus and chlorophyll were higher in dimictic than in polymictic lakes. Chlorophyll was probably not limited either by phosphorus or by nitrogen in shallow lakes. Utilization of phosphorus in terms of chlorophyll:particulate phosphorus and chlorophyll:particulate nitrogen ratios was similar in the two groups of lakes. Significant differences were found, however, in the chlorophyll:seston ratio, higher in dimictic lakes. These observations together suggest that seston in shallow lakes contains a significant, though unpredictable contribution of detritus/mineral particles much poorer in phosphorus than those in dimictic lakes. Secchi disc depth was better explained in shallow lakes by seston variability than by chlorophyll. Thus, algal production in shallow masurian lakes seems to be limited by light conditions resulting from resuspension of non-living particles while the production in deep lakes is nutrient (both nitrogen and phosphorus) limited.

However, the morphological characteristics and filling sequence of these cements, and their formation mechanism and paleoceanographic significance, are poorly understood. Our investigation of five outcrop sections in the northern upper Yangtze region allows four types of fibrous dolomite cement to be identified: fascicular fast dolomite (FFD), radial fast dolomite (RFD), radial slow dolomite (RSD), and fascicular slow dolomite (FSD), where "fast" and "slow" refer to the optical character of cement crystals. FFD cements possess original aragonitic mineralogy, whereas RFD cements had high-Mg calcitic precursors that subsequently underwent mimetic dolomitization via syntaxial replacement. RSDs and FSDs are primary marine precipitates, whereas fibrous dolomite cements with length-fast optical characteristics (FFDs and RFDs) are of secondary origin. These fibrous cements are widely distributed laterally in the Dengying Formation, although the RSDs and FSDs occur only in the second member of this formation. Therefore, the seawater chemistry of the terminal Ediacaran period in the upper Yangtze area was dominated by an aragonite sea, with a regional short-lived "dolomite sea" during the late depositional stage of the second member of the Dengying Formation, from which dolomite may have directly precipitated.					; Tang, Hao/L-9976-2019	Wang, Lichao/0000-0002-5065-1843; , Dongfang/0000-0003-1657-2911													0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 1	2021	581								110635	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110635		SEP 2021											WOS:000704173300009

To simulate short term summer drought, water levels were lowered (20 cm) after two weeks in half of the cores (experimental cores) and remained near the surface in the other half (blanks). After two more weeks, the water levels were brought back to the surface in the experimental cores and remained there for another two weeks. In the blanks, reduction and alkalinization of the top peat layer occurred. In the experimental soil cores oxidation and acidification started within one week after drawdown. An indication for a drought induced rise in soluble reactive phosphorus has been found. The velocity of the acidification process illustrates the dynamic nature of the hydrochemical conditions in fen soils during drought. The processes controlling the acid/base status of rich fen, the effect of drought induced acidification on P availability and the significance for the vegetation are discussed.																			0168-2563					APR	1997	37	1					15	32		10.1023/A:1005767505058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005767505058													WOS:A1997WR47300002

The changing face of the Arctic: four decades of greening and implications for tundra ecosystems	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Arctic landscapes occupy a nexus of environmental change processes, globally significant soil carbon stores, wildlife populations, and subsistence-based human societies. In response to rapid climate warming, tundra ecosystems are experiencing widespread changes to vegetation and underlying permafrost, coupled with an array of ecological disturbances that are expected to intensify in the future. Declines in the extent of the cryosphere on land (permafrost and seasonal snow) and offshore (sea-ice) raise the question of whether and for how long warmer portions of the Low Arctic will fit established concepts of "what is Arctic," given the influence the cryosphere has historically had on tundra ecosystem structure and function. The era of spaceborne observation of circumpolar tundra greenness, in the form of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), has entered its fifth decade and provides foundational information concerning ecosystem conditions and responses to climatic trends, variability, ecological disturbance, and successional processes. Here we review the evolving story of Arctic greening, and synthesize long-term spaceborne records of NDVI, climatic data, field observations, and the knowledge base of Arctic residents to place the last four decades of Arctic environmental change in context, and establish expectations and research priorities for the coming decade. Greenness dynamics display high spatio-temporal variability, reflecting complex interactions of climatic warming and variability, landscape history, ecological disturbance, and other factors. Nonetheless, long-term increases in NDVI-commonly known as "the greening of the Arctic"-remain prominent across large areas in all available long-term spaceborne datasets and align with long-term shifts in vegetation structure documented in disparate Arctic regions. Common shifts reported from the Low Arctic, such as shrubification, generally portend declines in floristic diversity, and shifts in fauna that favor boreal forest species. Despite lingering uncertainties regarding trend attribution and sources of interannual variability, the sequence of record-high circumpolar tundra greenness values observed since 2020 provides strong evidence that Arctic tundra ecosystems have entered a state without historic precedent on timescales approaching a millennium.

J	REIMCHEN, TE				REIMCHEN, TE			INEFFICIENT PREDATORS AND PREY INJURIES IN A POPULATION OF GIANT STICKLEBACK	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												I describe predator-induced injuries in a lake population of large-bodied Gasterosteus aculeatus from the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia [Canada]. Injuries, which included structural damage (fractured dorsal and pelvic spines) and skin lacerations (scars, abrasions, and punctures), were observed on 13.4% of the population. Bill imprints ("aviscars") from avian piscivores, including Podiceps grisegena and Gavia immer, occurred on one-third of the injured fish. Mean aviscar width (4.2 mm) was low in winter and higher in midsummer correlating with seasonal differences in the presence of avian taxa. One-half of the injured fish had fractured spines without any associated skin damage; sources of these injuries could not be verified although they probably resulted from avian piscivores and resident salmonids. Rate of spine regeneration, determined on artifically marked fish, was 1.09 mm over 26 months. Age of injuries, assessed by condition and regrowth of spines, included recent attacks (ca. 1 month or less 6.3%) and old attacks (1-3 years, 40%). Thirty percent of skin injuries are undetectable after 1 year. Injuries were absent on juvenile fish (< 50 mm) but were common on adults, reaching an incidence of 32% on subsamples of the largest fish (> 82 mm). These data are consistent with theoretical predictions of increased manipulation inefficiencies among gape-limited predators and can account in part for the evolution of large body size in this population. Mark.sbd.recapture studies on 12,272 adult stickleback (> 70 mm) showed that the probability of incurring a predator injury as an adult fish (0.09/year) is largely a consequence of total length of time in the population; this finding amplifies size-dependent trends in injury frequencies.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				SEP	1988	66	9					2036	2044		10.1139/z88-299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z88-299													WOS:A1988Q059700020
J	Mayle, FE; Beerling, DJ; Gosling, WD; Bush, MB				Mayle, FE; Beerling, DJ; Gosling, WD; Bush, MB			Responses of Amazonian ecosystems to climatic and atmospheric carbon dioxide changes since the last glacial maximum	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES					Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Tropical-Biology-and -Conservation	JUL, 2002	Panama City, PANAMA					The aims of this paper are to review previously published palaeovegetation and independent palaeoclimatic datasets together with new results we present from dynamic vegetation model simulations and modern pollen rain studies to: (i) determine the responses of Amazonian ecosystems to changes in temperature, precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations that occurred since the last glacial maximum (LGM), ca. 21 000 years ago; and (ii) use this long-term perspective to predict the likely vegetation responses to future climate change. Amazonia remained predominantly forested at the LGM, although the combination of reduced temperatures, precipitation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations resulted in forests structurally and floristically quite different from those of today. Cold-adapted Andean taxa mixed with rainforest taxa in central areas, while dry forest species and lianas probably became important in the more seasonal southern Amazon forests and savannahs expanded at forest-savannah ecotones. Net primary productivity (NPP) and canopy density were significantly lower than today. Evergreen rainforest distribution and NPP increased during the glacial -Holocene transition owing to ameliorating climatic and CO2 conditions. However, reduced precipitation in the Early-Mid-Holocene (ca. 8000-3600 years ago) caused widespread, frequent fires in seasonal southern Amazonia, causing increased abundance of drought-tolerant dry forest taxa and savannahs in ecotonal areas. Rainforests expanded once more in the Late Holocene owing to increased precipitation caused by greater austral summer insolation, although some of this forest expansion (e.g. in parts of the Bolivian Beni) is clearly caused by palaeo Indian landscape modification. The plant communities that existed during the Early-Mid-Holocene may provide insights into the kinds of vegetation response expected from similar increases in temperature and aridity predicted for the twenty-first century. We infer that ecotonal areas near the margins of the Amazon Basin are liable to be most sensitive to future environmental change and should therefore be targeted with conservation strategies that allow 'natural' species movements and plant community re-assortments to occur.					; Gosling, William/D-2459-2009; Beerling, David/C-2840-2009	Bush, Mark/0000-0001-6894-8613; Mayle, Francis/0000-0001-9208-0519; Gosling, William/0000-0001-9903-8401; Beerling, David/0000-0003-1869-4314													0962-8436	1471-2970				MAR 29	2004	359	1443					499	514		10.1098/rstb.2003.1434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2003.1434								15212099					WOS:000220545100014

However, many of them need to be well managed and better exploited, thus requiring baseline descriptive studies to assess faunal patterns and trends. Oualidia lagoon is not an exception. In fact, the studies conducted to date in the lagoon mainly focused on its oceanographic features and aquaculture capacities. The present paper presents the first study on the whole macrofaunal assemblages of Oualidia lagoon, having as main objectives analyze the composition and structure of the assemblages, as well as their relationships with the main environmental variables explaining their spatial distribution variability in the enclosed ecosystem of the Oualidia coastal lagoon. The benthic macroinvertebrates of Oualidia lagoon were studied in summer 2013 based on 43 stations spread over the whole lagoon by using a Van Veen grab. Two replicate samples were collected for macrobenthos and one additional replicate for sediment analyses at each station. Also, single water salinity and temperature measurements were recorded at each station. Fifty-one species from seven different taxa were recorded, among which mollusks (37%), polychaetes (25%) and crustaceans (25%) dominated in terms of species number. Peringia ulvae, Abra alba, Sphaeroma serratum, Cerastoderma edule and Corophium sp. accounted for 88% of total abundance. The benthos was structured along a downstream-upstream gradient, showing three assemblages, named according to the IndVal index: (1) Diopatra cf. marocensis, (2) Peringia ulvae, and (3) Cerastoderma edule, while the main factors driving their distribution were granulometry and salinity. The Biotic and Environmental analysis showed that the combination of granulometry and salinity was the major factors controlling the spatial distribution of the macrozoobenthos in the Oualidia Lagoon.					; Ahmed, Errhif/KBB-4982-2024; MAANAN, Mohamed/F-1430-2013; Martin, Daniel/G-5232-2010	Maanan, Mohamed/0000-0003-3526-2070; Martin, Daniel/0000-0001-6350-7384													2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2022	12	5							96	10.1007/s13201-022-01629-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-022-01629-z													WOS:000777540600004

Phreatomagmatic volcanic hazards where rift-systems meet the sea, a study from Ambae Island, Vanuatu	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					General Assembly of the International-Association-of-Geodesy/24th General Assembly of the International-Union-of-Geodesy-and-Geophysics	JUL 02-13, 2007	Perugia, ITALY	Int Assoc Geodesy, Int Union Geodesy & Geophys				Ambae Island is a mafic stratovolcano located in the northern Vanuatu volcanic arc and has a NE-SW rift-controlled elongated shape. Several hundred scoria cones and fissure-fed lava fields occur along its long axis. After many decades of quiescence, Ambae Island erupted on the 28th of November 2005, disrupting the lives of its 10,000 inhabitants. Its activity remained focused at the central (crater-lake filled) vent and this is where hazard-assessments were focused. These assessments initially neglected that maars, tephra cones and rings occur at each tip of the island where the eruptive activity occurred < 500 and < 300 yr B.P. The products of this explosive phreatomagmatic activity are located where the rift axis meets the sea. At the NE edge of the island five tephra rings occur, each comparable in size to those on the summit of Ambae. Along the NE coastline, a near-continuous cliff section exposes an up to 25 m thick succession of near-vent phreatomagmatic tephra units derived from closely spaced vents. This can be subdivided into two major lithofacies associations. The first association represents when the locus of explosions was below sea level and comprises matrix-supported, massive to weakly stratified beds of coarse ash and lapilli. These are dominant in the lowermost part of the sequence and commonly contain coral fragments, indicating that the loci of explosion were located within a reef or coral sediment near the syn-eruptive shoreline. The second type indicate more stable vent conditions and rapidly repeating explosions of high intensity, producing fine-grained tephra with undulatory bedding and cross-lamination as well as megaripple bedforms. These surge and fall beds are more common in the uppermost part of the succession and form a few-m-thick pile. An older tephra succession of similar character occurs below, and buried trees in growth position, as well as those flattened within base surge beds. This implies that the centre of this eruption was very near the coastline. The processes implied by these deposits are amongst the most violent forms of volcanism on this island. In addition, the lowland and coastal areas affected by these events are the most heavily populated. This circumstance is mirrored on many similar volcanic islands, including the nearby SW Pacific examples of Taveuni (Fiji), Upolu and Savai'i (Samoa), and Ambrym (Vanuatu). These locations are paradoxically often considered safe areas during summit/central-vent eruptions, simply because they are farthest from the central sources of ash-fall and lahar hazard. The observations presented here necessitate a revision of this view. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	ROBINSON, CT; MINSHALL, GW				ROBINSON, CT; MINSHALL, GW			LONGITUDINAL DEVELOPMENT OF MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES BELOW OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE OUTLETS	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected at several sites downstream of three oligotrphic lake outfalls in July 1986. Total numbers, biomass, and species richness increased rapidly immediately downstream from the outlets, and then either stabilized or continued to increase downstream in parallel with benthic organic matter standing crops. Filter feeder densities showed an initial buildup and then decline downstream from the outlets. Variability in longitudinal patterns of other functional feeding groups among lake outlets was related to differences in food quantity and quality, and microhabitat. An additional set of samples was collected at Pettit Lake outlet in August 1986. Species richness and total density peaked sooner under baseflow conditions in August than under spring runoff conditions in June. Distributions of all functional feeding groups, except filter feeders, also differed between the two periods, reflecting differences in the physical environment. We conclude that reduced lentic inputs of particulate organic matter seston and improved habitat suitability downstream are responsible for the progressive development of macroinvertebrate communities in oligotrophic lake outlets. These data imply the importance of the habitat templet in the structuring of benthic communities.																			0017-3614					DEC 31	1990	50	4					303	311																WOS:A1990FJ87400001

In the spring of 2004, 284 bait posts were sampled in 3 x 3 km cells for four sessions in the Daring Lake area of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Bait posts were baited with caribou and scent lures. As well, a fish lure was dragged around by snowmobiles during bait post setup. One hair sample was genotyped from each post for each session. Results suggested a high degree of attraction to bait posts by wolverines with capture probabilities of > 0.5 for both sexes and very precise estimates for females. Males displayed substantial closure violation whereas females did not. Investigation of reduced effort designs suggests that a 2-session sampling design with moderate densities of bait posts is adequate for estimation of population size for wolverines due to high capture probabilities. A longer-term monitoring effort is recommended to allow better understanding of wolverine populations in the area.

The lake is linked to the Seine River by an artificial channel and used for both recreation and fishing. Little data on cyanobacterial blooms is available in France. The aim of this preliminary study was to characterise the cyanobacterial bloom limnologically as well as for toxicity levels at one site in the lake and another in the channel. A relatively high biomass of P. agardhii was maintained throughout the year with maximum density in winter (7.9x 10(4) to 4.5 x 10(6) trichomes/L). The only other significant phytoplankton species in the water bodies was also a cyanobacterium: Limnothrix redekei. The nutrient levels in the lake, although still relatively high (SRP varied in the range between 0.13 and 2 muM but NO3- stayed under the detection limit), were generally lower than in the channel which reflected the hydraulic influence of exchanges with the eutrophic Seine River. The concentration of microcystins (hepatotoxic cyclic heptapeptides) was measured in bloom extracts throughout the year using two different techniques: protein phosphatase 2A inhibition assay and high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). High microcystin concentrations, up to 5.2 mug/L MCYST-LR eq., were found at the two sampling sites, with good correlation between the two methods. The presence of five different microcystins was confirmed by further analysis of samples by LC-MS. Factors affecting seasonal population bloom dynamics, toxicity and the possible public health significance of these toxic cyanobacterial populations in the lake are discussed.					; Bernard, Cecile/AAE-4242-2022; Briand, Jean-françois/AAA-5128-2021	Briand, Jean-francois/0000-0001-8729-2621; Bernard, Cecile/0000-0001-7032-3989													0003-9136					MAR	2002	153	4					605	622																WOS:000175390600006

Environmental Drivers and Fitness Consequences of Partial Migration under Climate Change	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Animals migrate to access seasonally variable resources or to escape unfavorable local conditions. Partial (flexible) migration strategies offer animals a fitness trade-off in which individuals may choose whether to incur the energetic costs of migration depending on the potential benefits associated with avoiding adverse conditions. Partial migration patterns may shift because of anthropogenic land use and climate change, possibly reducing the benefits of migration and resulting in unpredictable migration cues. We examined causes, consequences, and changes in individual-level partial migration of white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus by analyzing archival telemetry data (1986-2014) across four distinct populations in the Great Lakes region, North America. We hypothesized that if the costs of migration outweigh benefits, we would see migratory behavior decline. Migratory behavior declined from 75% in 1987 to 11% in 2014 independent of population identity. Annual mortality was higher for migratory white-tailed deer, whereas increasing minimum temperatures positively impacted survival but did not influence migration. Our results suggest that migratory behavior in white-tailed deer is declining over time and may be associated with declining winter severity. The loss of migratory behavior in large mammals may have ecosystem-level impacts and our study emphasizes the need to better understand and conserve these migratory traditions.

Eighty-four ponds were sampled in mid-summer, and the relationship between colony size and relative abundance of each cyanobacterial species was analyzed. Anabaena crassa and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were the dominant species in terms of frequency of appearance. The colony size of An. crassa increased significantly with its relative abundance. The relative abundance of C. raciborskii was usually below 10%, and its filament length was not correlated with its relative abundance. The colonies of Microcystis aeruginosa normally consisted of several tens of cells. However, when M. aeruginosa exclusively dominated the plankton community, the average number of cells in a colony reached several hundreds. The mean filament length of Planktothricoides raciborskii significantly increased with its relative abundance. The correlations between colony size and relative abundance of the ten cyanobacterial species were significantly positive for three species, insignificantly positive for five species and insignificantly negative for two species. Given the various ecological advantages of large colonies, the results of this study may suggest that the formation of large colonies of some cyanobacterial species is important to their dominance and/or bloom formation.					; Shiah夏復國, Fuh-Kwo/AAP-3246-2021	Chen, Yi-Lung/0000-0001-7840-7423; 													0003-4088					JAN	2011	47	2					167	173		10.1051/limn/2011013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2011013													WOS:000292876800007
J	STEWART, DJ; BINKOWSKI, FP				STEWART, DJ; BINKOWSKI, FP			DYNAMICS OF CONSUMPTION AND FOOD CONVERSION BY LAKE-MICHIGAN ALEWIVES - AN ENERGETICS-MODELING SYNTHESIS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We developed an energetics model for the alewife Alosa pseudoharengus to evaluate consumption and conversion efficiency processes. We estimated alewife standard metabolism (R) as a function of wet body weight (W, g) and water temperature (T, .degree.C): R (g .cntdot. g-1 .cntdot. d-1) = 0.0073W-0.215e0.05487. We estimated maximum daily ration for 15-g, yearling alewives at 20.degree. C to be as much as 37% of their body weight in experiments of 24 h. Modeling simulations based on observed growth in Lake Michigan indicated that yearling alewives may attain close to 70% of their estimated maximum consumption rate during September and October. Simulation results indicated wide seasonal variations in consumption rates; almost 50% of the yearly consumption by an individual adult alewife (age .gtoreq. II) occurs in September and October, suggesting abundant food and possibly relaxed competition during that season. In contrast, adult alewives lose weight during the summer when stratification of Lake Michigan would permit orientation to water temperatures optimal for growth, suggesting that serious food limitations during that period may heighten competitive interactions. Over an annual cycle, adults converted only 1.3-2.8% of food consumed (wet weight) to body biomass; young of the year converted 5%. Conversion of energy consumed to body energy was higher than biomass conversion, but still relatively low for older age-classes-2.3-5.2% for adults and 12.7% for young of the year. Total annual consumption and conversion efficiency estimates were relatively insensitive to assumptions about sesonal dynamics of body energy density (J .cntdot. g-1 wet weight) but within seasons when energy density was changing rapidly, an assumption of constant energy density yielded errors of -45% to 104% for those variables.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	1986	115	5					643	661		10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<643:DOCAFC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<643:DOCAFC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1986F718200001
J	Paulsson, O; Widerlund, A				Paulsson, Oscar; Widerlund, Anders			Algal nutrient limitation and metal uptake experiment in the Akerberg pit lake, northern Sweden	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												A microcosm nutrient limitation experiment was conducted in the Akerberg pit lake, located in Vasterbotten, northern Sweden, in the summer of 2018. The microcosms were fertilized with N, P and N and P in combination. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were used to estimate algal growth. Filtered and suspended metal concentrations of the microcosms were compared to see if an increase in algal growth would lead to higher metal uptake. The results show that the microcosms fertilized with N and P had the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations (3-3.4 mu g/l). This corresponds to an increase of 9.5-11 times compared to the initial chlorophyll-a concentrations, suggesting that the lake is nutrient poor with regards to both N and P. An increase of the metal concentration in the suspended particulate samples (>0.2 mu m) of the microcosms fertilized with both N and P could be observed particularly for the mining-related metals Cd, Co, Ni, and Zn. The uptake of these metals amounted to 2.5-20% (Cd), 2.6-14% (Co), 0.87-1.8% (Ni), and 19-64% (Zn) of their filtered concentrations (<0.2 mu m).																			0883-2927	1872-9134				FEB	2021	125								104829	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.104829	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.104829		JAN 2021											WOS:000612516700005
J	Li, XH; Li, Z; Lin, YL				Li, Xianghu; Li, Zhen; Lin, Yaling			Suitability of TRMM Products with Different Temporal Resolution (3-Hourly, Daily, and Monthly) for Rainfall Erosivity Estimation	REMOTE SENSING												Rainfall erosivity (RE) is a significant indicator of erosion capacity. The application of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall products to deal with RE estimation has not received much attention. It is not clear which temporal resolution of TRMM data is most suitable. This study quantified the RE in the Poyang Lake basin, China, based on TRMM 3B42 3-hourly, daily, and 3B43 monthly rainfall data, and investigated their suitability for estimating RE. The results showed that TRMM 3-hourly product had a significant systematic underestimation of monthly RE, especially during the period of April-June for the large values. The TRMM 3B42 daily product seems to have better performance with the relative bias of 3.0% in summer. At the annual scale, TRMM 3B42 daily and 3B43 monthly data had acceptable accuracy, with mean error of 1858 and -85 MJ center dot mm/ha center dot h and relative bias of 18.3% and -0.85%, respectively. A spatial performance analysis showed that all three TRMM products generally captured the overall spatial patterns of RE, while the TRMM 3B43 product was more suitable in depicting the spatial characteristics of annual RE. This study provides valuable information for the application of TRMM products in mapping RE and risk assessment of soil erosion.

Life cycle shifts in Baetis rhodani (Ephemeroptera) in the Norwegian mountains	AQUATIC INSECTS					12th International Conference on Ephemeroptera/16th International Symposium on Plecoptera	JUN 08-14, 2008	State Museum Nat Hist, Stuttgart, GERMANY		State Museum Nat Hist			The life cycle of the widely distributed mayfly, Baetis rhodani, was investigated in Ovre Heimdalen, in the Jotunheimen Mountains of central southern Norway. B. rhodani displayed a shift in life cycle from Univoltine below the lake, Ovre Heimdalsvatn (1090 in a.s.l.) to a two-year life cycle in the inflowing stream, Brurskardbekken (1100-1300 in a.s.l.). The day degree SLIM for the univoltine life cycle was 950 compared to 1500-1550 for the two-year life cycle. Larvae of B. rhodani grew rapidly during the ice-free period (June-October) with growth rates of 2.1-8.1% (mg/day), while growth rates were low during winter (0.3-0.5%). There was a positive correlation between growth (mg/day) and temperature (r(2) = 0.34, p = 0.02). Although larval growth and voltinism were influenced by water temperature, other factors such as food resources are likely to be important in mountain areas. The life cycle plasticity exhibited by B. rhodani has undoubtedly contributed to its success in colonising a wide range of running water habitats throughout Europe.																			0165-0424	1744-4152					2009	31			1			283	291		10.1080/01650420902732362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650420902732362													WOS:000273391600027
J	Jackman, RE; Hunt, WG				Jackman, Ronald E.; Hunt, W. Grainger			Bald eagle foraging and reservoir management in northern California	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												We studied food habits, mechanisms of prey acquisition, and the effects of reservoir drawdown and fisheries management in a population of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nesting on Shasta (Lake) Reservoir, a large impoundment in northern California used intensively for irrigation and recreation. Prey deliveries at seven nests were mostly bass (Micropterus sp., 55% of total prey biomass) and salmonids (14%), and all principal fish prey species were either introduced or regularly stocked. Carrion and moribund fish, mostly bass, accounted for > 75% of successful foraging attempts. Fish mortality was related to spawning stress, disease, and catch-and-release angling; fish fatalities associated with bass fishing provided carrion throughout the breeding season. The proportions of fish species in the eagles' diet, as measured by prey deliveries to the nest, were positively correlated with those found in live-fish sampling and carrion surveys; all were predominantly bass. Benefits associated with seasonal and long-term reservoir drawdown included exposing spawning and foraging fish to eagle predation, and the likely release of nutrients and food for rapid fish growth upon re-inundation. Probable disadvantages of extended drawdown included loss of eagle foraging habitat and reductions in the standing crop of fish, likely resulting in competition among eagle pairs. Bald Eagle productivity was at or above average during the 2-yr study, a relatively wet period following along drought and associated low pool levels, and we found a positive relationship between historic spring reservoir levels and Bald Eagle productivity from 1979-1999. Effects of fish introductions on trophic relationships and species composition warrant careful examination of eagle foraging requirements; however, past and present fisheries management appears to be currently benefiting the opportunistic eagles.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				SEP	2007	41	3					202	211		10.3356/0892-1016(2007)41[202:BEFARM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/0892-1016(2007)41[202:BEFARM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000250151000002

In particular, increasing inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may affect gas dynamics and alter seasonal changes in gas production. Here, we analysed variations in CH4 and CO2 dynamics in sub-basins of an acidic bog lake, which was artificially divided into four quarters three decades ago, leading to divergence in water chemistry and biology. In the divided lake, only the south-west basin (SW) received DOC inputs from an adjacent peat bog, while the north-east basin (NE) was hydrologically disconnected. A year-long determination of CH4 and CO2 production and emission patterns in the two contrasting basins exposed the indirect mechanisms by which DOC supply exercised control on greenhouse gas dynamics in this shallow lake. In both basins, dissolved CH4 was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (O-2) through the water column, suggesting that aerobic methanotrophy is an important regulator of CH4 emissions in this lake. In contrast, the amount of CO2 stored in oxic and anoxic layers was not significantly different between the basins, suggesting that O-2 is not the most important driver of dissolved CO2. Estimated total CH4 and CO2 emissions were 2.1 and 1.7 times lower in the NE basin than in the SW basin, with major CH4 and CO2 emissions occurring during the fall turnover. The differences in CH4 and CO2 emissions suggest that the hydro-physical properties, namely seasonal temperature, the duration of stratification and O-2 availability, are the main drivers of CH4 and CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from small shallow lakes under the influence of DOC inputs under global warming pressure.

This issue is compounded by the steady, global loss of wetlands and their water quality services. Wetlaculture, an integrated system of wetlands and agriculture, has been proposed as a solution to HABs in which farmland located on former wetlands is flipped to serve as a nutrient-sequestering treatment wetland for a period of years, then flipped back to farmland which consumes the stored nutrients for crop production without the need for fertilizers. A wetlaculture mesocosm experiment was initiated at Buckeye Lake, Ohio in 2016, where all of the site's mesocosms had been functioning as treatment wetlands fed with water from an adjacent, nutrient-impaired stream prior to the 2020 season. This study serves as both a continuation of the treatment wetland experiment, and a first attempt at the cultivation of an agricultural crop in wetlaculture mesocosms. Eight of the twenty-eight mesocosms were drained and planted with corn (Zea mays), while the remaining twenty continued to function as treatment wetlands. Inflow and outflow concentrations of five nutrient species were monitored in the wetland mesocosms, while suitability for corn was evaluated via preplant soil tests and ultimate grain yield, which was compared to that of a nearby commercial farm. End-of-season soil analyses from both the corn and wetland mesocosms were taken to determine the impact of these disparate management regimes on total soil N, P, K, and C. Results indicate that the treatment wetlands continued to improve water quality and that the mesocosms planted with corn produced a grain crop without fertilization. Mesocosm yields (58 +/- 9.5 bu./ac) fell significantly below those of the reference farm (160 +/- 15.3 bu./ac)(p = 0.004). Some of that difference may be due to the frequent herbivory that occurred during this study, in addition to the limited soil volume in the 0.285 m(3) mesocosm tubs versus the open agricultural field.					; Bakshi, Bhavik/G-3878-2012	Bakshi, Bhavik/0000-0002-6604-8408; Boutin, Kyle/0000-0002-6541-5106													0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2021	171								106366	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106366		AUG 2021											WOS:000694948100002

Holocene evolution and Anthropocene destruction of the Krishna Delta on the east coast of India: Delta lobe shifts, human impacts, and sea-level history	MARINE GEOLOGY												The Holocene evolution of the Krishna Delta was inferred using landform characteristics and 11 sediment cores with 59 Accelerator Mass Spectrometry C-14 dates. The landform assemblages in a 5880 km(2) area of the Krishna Delta indicate an upper (landward) river-built fluvial plain and a lower (seaward) marine-built beach-ridge plain. Holocene sediment unconformably overlying a Pleistocene basement consists of 11 sedimentary facies, mainly shallowing-upward and deltaic succession. Sea level indicators such as the basal mangrove peat layers above the Pleistocene basement and the foreshore sediments indicate that the sea level rose from -9 m to - 3 m during 8.3-6.3 cal ky BP, and stabilised at the present level around 5 cal ky BP. The 3539 km(2) area of the Krishna Delta beach-ridge plain developed in five major stages during the last 6 cal ky, with distinct lateral and seaward migration of delta lobes (depocentre shifts). Delta progradation accelerated in the last 500 years, forming an outbuilding lobate delta. However, predominant erosion along the sediment-starved coast during the past five decades, due to impoundment of riverine inputs at the burgeoning upstream dams, has pushed the Krishna Delta into a persistent destruction phase.

Hydrological impacts of climate change in gauged sub-watersheds of Lake Tana sub-basin (Gilgel Abay, Gumara, Megech, and Ribb) watersheds, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Climate change has been increasing in influencing the water resources of the whole world as a result of increasing carbon emissions. Hence, evaluating the impacts of climate change on the hydrology of gauged watersheds of Lake Tana sub-basin where the socio-economic activities of the surrounding community highly depend on this basin is the prime task of the researchers. For this study, HBV hydrological model was used to simulate future climate change impacts on hydrology. For Gilgel Abay, Gumara, Megech, and Ribb, the model exhibited NS values of 0.803, 0.79, 0.68, and 0.797 during calibration and 0.82, 0.8, 0.801, and 0.82 during validation, respectively. For Gilgel Abay, Gumara, Megech, and Ribb, model results RVE of - 0.72%, 3.7%, 8.9%, and - 0.68% are during calibration and 8.76%, -1.5%, - 5.89%, and 8.5% during validations, respectively. Climate change impacts on the hydrology of the Gilgel Abay, Gumara, Megech, and Ribb watersheds were assessed using projections from two ensembles GCMs (MPI and MIROC) for one RCM (RCA4) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for the 2040-s and 2070-s time domains. Even though the expected number of changes differed among watersheds, GCMs, and RCPs, increasing runoffs in the dry season and lowering runoffs in the wet season are detected in both periods, owing primarily to changes in projected precipitation. Even if future flow improves in the dry seasons, which might provide water for agriculture, a decrease in flow during the wet seasons would diminish Lake Tana storage during the summer, which would be used for the Tana Belles Hydropower project, potentially affecting Tana Belles Hydropower water demand and Lake Navigation depth. These changes will harm the country's economic well-being, necessitating successful adaptation measures to lessen susceptibility. The study revealed that climate change will influence the hydrology of the basin; hence, the government and concerned bodies have to be planned and implement future water resources management and adoption activities in the Lake Tana sub-basins.

Environments and trypanosomiasis risks for early herders in the later Holocene of the Lake Victoria basin, Kenya	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Specialized pastoralism developed similar to 3 kya among Pastoral Neolithic Elmenteitan herders in eastern Africa. During this time, a mosaic of hunters and herders using diverse economic strategies flourished in southern Kenya. It has been argued that the risk for trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), carried by tsetse flies in bushy environments, had a significant influence on pastoral diversification and migration out of eastern Africa toward southern Africa similar to 2 kya. Elmenteitan levels at Gogo Falls (ca. 1.9-1.6 kya) preserve a unique faunal record, including wild mammalian herbivores, domestic cattle and caprines, fish, and birds. It has been suggested that a bushy/woodland habitat that harbored tsetse fly constrained production of domestic herds and resulted in subsistence diversification. Stable isotope analysis of herbivore tooth enamel (n = 86) from this site reveals, instead, extensive C-4 grazing by both domesticates and the majority of wild herbivores. Integrated with other ecological proxies (pollen and leaf wax biomarkers), these data imply an abundance of C-4 grasses in the Lake Victoria basin at this time, and thus little risk for tsetse-related barriers to specialized pastoralism. These data provide empirical evidence for the existence of a grassy corridor through which small groups of herders could have passed to reach southern Africa.

J	Hodgson, DA; Vyverman, W; Sabbe, K				Hodgson, DA; Vyverman, W; Sabbe, K			Limnology and biology of saline lakes in the Rauer Islands, eastern Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The Rauer Islands contain more than fifty shallow lakes and small ephemeral ponds. Despite their proximity to the Vestfold Hills-one of the most diverse and intensively studied lake districts of eastern Antarctica-the lakes of the Rauer Islands have remained undescribed. In this study the physical and chemical limnology and biology of ten lakes is presented and their species-environment relationships explored using multivariate statistics. Analyses of chemical and biological data indicate that the Rauer Islands form a distinct limnological province amongst the lakes of the Prydz Bay oases. Salinities range from hypo- to hyper-saline with an ionic order close to that of seawater. Deviance from this order indicates either an earlier origin for some of the most hypersaline lakes when compared with the Vestfold Hills, more rapid evaporation vs precipitation or differences in the sources of ions resulting from isostatic history. With fluctuating salinities, winter water temperatures below -10 degreesC, seasonal ice and slush fori-nation, desiccation and high levels of solar radiation, the lacustrine environment presents considerable abiotic challenges for biological survival. Results indicate that there is little or no planktonic flora in the lakes and no zooplankton were encountered. Despite this, analyses of pigments, diatoms and other micro-algae revealed an active and diverse benthic biota characterized by filamentous cyanobacteria with interstitial algae. Thirty-eight diatom taxa, and a selection of Chlorophyta and Xanthophyta were detected amongst the cyanobacteria. Clusters in the diatom data correspond to salinity. Further analyses of the relationships between the biota and their environment revealed some of the strategies employed for survival, In particular, the synthesis of scytonemin was detected. This pigment is known to function as an extracellular UV sunscreen which protects cyanobacterial cells against damage by ultraviolet radiation, These results support the hypothesis that environmental extremes and biogeographical isolation control the biology of these lakes.																			0954-1020					SEP	2001	13	3					255	270		10.1017/S0954102001000372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102001000372													WOS:000170952200006

Rapid-assessment test strips: effectiveness for cyanotoxin monitoring in a northern temperate lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												LeDuc JF, Christensen VG, Maki RP. 2020. Rapid assessment test strips: effectiveness for cyanotoxin monitoring in a northern temperate lake. Lake Reserv Manag, XX-XX. Precise and rapid methods of determining toxin levels are needed in lakes used for recreation and drinking water to facilitate a quick risk assessment during cyanobacteria blooms. Therefore, we evaluated rapid-assessment test strips, a newer technology for estimating the toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms, in Kabetogama Lake, a popular recreational area of Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota (USA). Sixty-seven percent of the test strip results matched results of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, with individual toxin results of 75% (anatoxin-a), 80% (cylindrospermopsin), and 64% (microcystin). These results provide some evidence that the test strips may be effective for rapid detection of toxins in northern temperate lakes, although improvements to the test strips may be beneficial. Despite the intensive processing required and uncertainty of some results, the availability of a rapid and inexpensive field method allowed us to sample opportunistically in the fall, when we documented dangerously high toxin concentrations at places where waterfowl-retrieving dogs may be at particular risk of exposure.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				OCT 1	2020	36	4					444	453		10.1080/10402381.2020.1805531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2020.1805531		AUG 2020											WOS:000565014800001
J	TONNESSEN, KA				TONNESSEN, KA			THE EMERALD LAKE WATERSHED STUDY - INTRODUCTION AND SITE DESCRIPTION	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Emerald Lake Watershed study was organized to investigate the effects of acidic deposition on high-elevation watersheds and surface waters of the Sierra Nevada, California. Some of the results of this comprehensive study of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems at a small, headwater basin are presented in four papers in this series. The watershed study site is in Sequoia National Park, on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. This glacial cirque is located in the upper Marble Fork of the Kaweah River. This 120-ha watershed ranges from Alta Peak (3416 m) down to Emerald Lake (2400 m). Most of the watershed surface area is exposed granite and granodiorite rocks, with limited coverage (about 20%) by thin, acidic soils. The hydrology of the basin is dominated by snowmelt runoff during March-June. Emerald Lake, a glacial tarn, is 2.72 ha in area, with a maximum depth of 10.5 m. Surface waters are poorly buffered and dominated by calcium and bicarbonate. Most of the yearly precipitation falls as dilute snow (pH 5.2-5.4), with acidic rain storms sampled during May-October.																			0043-1397					JUL	1991	27	7					1537	1539		10.1029/91WR00587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91WR00587													WOS:A1991FV77700015

Ecophysiological Examination of the Lake Erie Microcystis Bloom in 2014: Linkages between Biology and the Water Supply Shutdown of Toledo, OH	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Annual cyanobacterial blooms dominated by Microcystis have occurred in western Lake Erie (U.S./Canada) during summer months since 1995. The production of toxins by bloom-forming cyanobacteria can lead to drinking water crises, such as the one experienced by the city of Toledo in August of 2014, when the city was rendered without drinking water for >2 days. It is important to understand the conditions and environmental cues that were driving this specific bloom to provide a scientific framework for management of future bloom events. To this end, samples were collected and metatranscriptomes generated coincident with the collection of environmental metrics for eight sites located in the western basin of Lake Erie, including a station proximal to the water intake for the city of Toledo. These data were used to generate a basin-wide ecophysiological fingerprint of Lake Erie Microcystis populations in August 2014 for comparison to previous bloom communities. Our observations and analyses indicate that, at the time of sample collection, Microcystis populations were under dual nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stress, as genes involved in scavenging of these nutrients were being actively transcribed. Targeted analysis of urea transport and hydrolysis suggests a potentially important role for exogenous urea as a nitrogen source during the 2014 event. Finally, simulation data suggest a wind event caused microcystin-rich water from Maumee Bay to be transported east along the southern shoreline past the Toledo water intake. Coupled with a significant cyanophage infection, these results reveal that a combination of biological and environmental factors led to the disruption of the Toledo water supply. This scenario was not atypical of reoccurring Lake Erie blooms and thus may reoccur in the future.

These frozen surfaces provide essential ecosystem services that are vital to many northern communities. However, the availability of safe lake ice that is oftentimes required to support these services is under threat from climate change. Here we use a 100-member ensemble of climate model simulations to investigate changes in the presence of safe lake ice for different recreation and provisioning activities across the Northern Hemisphere. Our projections suggest that the duration of safe ice for recreational purposes will shorten, on average, by 13, 17, and 24 days within a 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C warmer world (relative to 1900-1929), respectively. The projected change in the duration of safe ice will be greater in higher latitudes, but with the most densely populated lower-latitude regions experiencing the greatest percent change. The use of lake ice to support critical transportation infrastructure will also be influenced by future warming through the loss of thicker ice this century. However, our projections suggest that the magnitude of change in the duration of safe ice will differ depending on the ice thickness requirements. For transportation that requires the thickest ice cover, the number of days with safe ice will decline by 90%, 95%, and 99% with 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C global warming, respectively. We highlight the need for the development and implementation of adaptation plans to address the imminent loss of critical wintertime transportation infrastructure across the Northern Hemisphere.					; Rodgers, Keith/AAL-4329-2021; Timmermann, Axel/F-4977-2011	Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768; Huang, Lei/0000-0002-7150-8245; Lee, Sun-Seon/0000-0001-7403-6485; Timmermann, Axel/0000-0003-0657-2969; Rodgers, Keith/0000-0002-6465-8923														2328-4277				OCT	2022	10	10							e2022EF002907	10.1029/2022EF002907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022EF002907													WOS:000863624200001
J	Schulson, EM; Renshaw, CE				Schulson, Erland M.; Renshaw, Carl E.			Fracture, Friction, and Permeability of Ice	ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES												Water ice Ih exhibits brittle behavior when rapidly loaded. Under tension, it fails via crack nucleation and propagation. Compressive failure is more complicated. Under low confinement, cracks slide and interact to form a frictional (Coulombic) fault. Under high confinement, frictional sliding is suppressed and adiabatic heating through crystallographic slip leads to the formation of a plastic fault. The coefficient of static friction increases with time under load, owing to creep of asperities in contact. The coefficient of kinetic (dynamic) friction, set by the ratio of asperity shear strength to hardness, increases with velocity at lower speeds and decreases at higher speeds as contacts melt through frictional heating. Microcracks, upon reaching a critical number density (which near the ductile-to-brittle transition is nearly constant above a certain strain rate), form a pathway for percolation. Additional work is needed on the effects of porosity and crack healing. An understanding of brittle failure is essential to better predict the integrity of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers and the tectonic evolution of the icy crusts of Enceladus, Europa, and other extraterrestrial satellites. Fundamental to the brittle failure of ice is the initiation and propagation of microcracks, frictional sliding across crack faces, and localization of strain through both crack interaction and adiabatic heating.																			0084-6597	1545-4495					2022	50						323	343		10.1146/annurev-earth-032320-085507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-032320-085507													WOS:000804955000014
J	TILZER, MM; GOLDMAN, CR				TILZER, MM; GOLDMAN, CR			IMPORTANCE OF MIXING, THERMAL STRATIFICATION AND LIGHT ADAPTATION FOR PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTIVITY IN LAKE TAHOE (CALIFORNIA-NEVADA)	ECOLOGY												Lake Tahoe [USA] is highly transparent (Secchi readings 20-42 m) and never freezes over. Deep mixing throughout its 500 m water column occurred in March 1974 and 1975. Between June and Oct. 1974, a distinct epilimnion of 15-30 m thickness existed. Phytoplankton [Cyclotella stelligera, C. bodanica, Melosira granulata, Stephanodiscus astraea, Fragillaria crotonensis, F. uaucheriae, Asterionella formosa Dinobryon sertularia and Kephyrion ovum] which is dominated by diatoms, showed no significant vertical shifts in species composition. Chlorophyll a concentrations were highest at the bottom of the trophogenic zone (75-100 m) during thermal stratification. Maximum photosynthetic rates were observed at greater depths during winter mixing of the lake than during thermal stratification. In situ experiments, in which incubation flasks containing phytoplankton from 3 discrete depths were distributed over the trophogenic zone, were conducted to study light adaptation. Seasonal variation in the vertical distribution of photosynthesis was controlled to a greater extent by algal adaptation to prevailing subaquatic light conditions than by variations in solar irradiance. During deep mixing of the lake, algae adapted to average prevailing low light intensities. Thermal stratification caused populations to remain at certain depths sufficiently long to adapt to ambient light intensities. Phytoplankton at shallow depths was light adapted, while deep populations remained dark adapted. During thermal stratification, light inhibition was minimized and dim light in deep water was utilized efficiently. At a defined light-saturated photysynthetic rate, integral photosynthesis in general was enhanced during thermal stratification relative to levels attained during lake mixing.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1978	59	4					810	821		10.2307/1938785	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938785													WOS:A1978GB33300023

A total of 909 samples were collected, 497 of which were dated to calendar years through dendrochronology and separated into six groups. A further tree-ring series of 20 samples were cross-dated into two groups and their ages established by means of radiocarbon dating. The new Trentino Chronology that was established on the basis of these samples covers more than 80% of the last ca. 11,500 years. The uneven distribution of wood samples through time is most likely caused by different factors, for example, climatic and anthropogenic factors. According to our observations, the trees fell at the sites where they were found. The tree-ring series show that trees often died after a period of pronounced growth decline, for example, as a consequence of variations in groundwater levels. A comparison of the Holocene sample distribution of the new Trentino Chronology with contemporaneous records of other European tree-ring chronologies suggests that, at least partly, the greater scale of climatic variability influenced the depositional frequency. The new data contribute to our understanding of past climatic variability and environmental dynamics.					; Bernabei, Mauro/AAI-7754-2020	Nicolussi, Kurt/0000-0002-1737-4119; Bernabei, Mauro/0000-0002-5218-3844													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2018	28	12					2017	2027		10.1177/0959683618798149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618798149													WOS:000450145600014

A. D. 1257 or 1258, most probably in the tropics. Estimates based on sulfate deposition in these records suggest that it yielded the largest volcanic sulfur release to the stratosphere of the past 7,000 y. Tree rings, medieval chronicles, and computational models corroborate the expected worldwide atmospheric and climatic effects of this eruption. However, until now there has been no convincing candidate for the mid-13th century "mystery eruption." Drawing upon compelling evidence from stratigraphic and geomorphic data, physical volcanology, radiocarbon dating, tephra geochemistry, and chronicles, we argue the source of this long-sought eruption is the Samalas volcano, adjacent to Mount Rinjani on Lombok Island, Indonesia. At least 40 km(3) (dense-rock equivalent) of tephra were deposited and the eruption column reached an altitude of up to 43 km. Three principal pumice fallout deposits mantle the region and thick pyroclastic flow deposits are found at the coast, 25 km from source. With an estimated magnitude of 7, this event ranks among the largest Holocene explosive eruptions. Radiocarbon dates on charcoal are consistent with a mid-13th century eruption. In addition, glass geochemistry of the associated pumice deposits matches that of shards found in both Arctic and Antarctic ice cores, providing compelling evidence to link the prominent A. D. 1258/1259 ice core sulfate spike to Samalas. We further constrain the timing of the mystery eruption based on tephra dispersal and historical records, suggesting it occurred between May and October A. D. 1257.

J	PIERSON, DC; COLOM, W; RODRIGO, MA				PIERSON, DC; COLOM, W; RODRIGO, MA			THE INFLUENCE OF PHOTOINHIBITION AND ALGAL SIZE ON VERTICAL VARIATIONS IN CHLOROPHYLL-A SPECIFIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Rates of chlorophyll-a specific photosynthesis were measured at 0.5 meter and 3.0 meter depths within Lake Erken (60 degrees N, Central Sweden) during the summer when the lake was seasonally stratified, and the upper meters of the water column were often diurnally stratified. The surface Values of both light limited (alpha(B)) and light saturated (P(B)max) photosynthesis consistently decreased to 30-40% of that measured at 3.0 meters. Two possible explanations for the decline in surface photosynthesis are possible: Photoinhibition by high surface irradiances. Migration of large colonial cyanobacteria, especially Gloeotrichia echinulata, to the surface. Because of their large size (100 - 2000 mu m) rates of chlorophyll-a specific photosynthesis are reduced, so that an increase in G. echinulata numbers will lead to decreases in whole water estimates of photosynthesis. To separate the effects of these two processes additional measurements were made on samples separated by filtration through a 90 mu m net which effectively removed the G. echinulata colonies from the remaining phytoplankton. In both of the size fractions declines in surface photosynthesis of up to 50% were found which could be attributed to photoinhibition. The chlorophyll-a specific rates of photosynthesis in the > 90 mu m size fraction were consistently lower than the < 90 mu m size fraction. Measurements made during a G. echinulata bloom suggest that size related reductions in surface photosynthesis on the order of 30% can be expected.

J	Kumar, S; Sterner, RW; Finlay, JC; Brovold, S				Kumar, Sanjeev; Sterner, Robert W.; Finlay, Jacques C.; Brovold, Sandra			Spatial and temporal variation of ammonium in lake superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Many aspects of Lake Superior's nitrogen cycle are poorly described in spite of the fact that the lake's nitrate concentration has risen dramatically this past century. One important, yet under-described parameter is the concentration of ammonium. Here, we present data to resolve spatial and temporal variation along with vertical profiles of ammonium concentration in Lake Superior. Lake-wide average concentrations were low (0.21 mu M, n =166) with considerable spatial and temporal variation. During the onset of summer, the western margin of the lake had higher average concentrations than open and eastern parts. Surface layer (< 10 m) ammonium concentrations showed an increase from January to October. Relatively higher ammonium concentration in the near bottom waters at a number of sites during August indicated efflux from sediment to be an important process. Subsurface maxima near the ther-mocline were observed in late August and persisted until September- October suggesting that ammonium might be controlled by food web processes during warm, stratified conditions. The higher potential for ammonium uptake compared to external inputs suggested rapid turnover of ammonium in the lake.

Oswald; Ren, Luyang			National Assessment of Bicycle Friendliness Using a Spatial Approach: Focus on Universities and Communities	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT												Bicycle mobility as a sustainable form of transportation has been increasing, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, evaluating bicycle friendly areas, including communities and universities, across the United States is valuable. The League of American Bicyclists organization has a certification for bicycle-friendly universities (BFUs) and bicycle-friendly communities (BFCs). This research investigates existing BFUs and BFCs based on a spatial and frequency analysis of factors to understand trends in bike-friendly certification across the country. The results show that the majority of BFCs and BFUs fall within a megaregion boundary with the highest density in the Great Lakes and the Northeast. In addition, the majority of BFUs are located within BFCs. Using a Geographic Information System, the BFUs and BFCs are mapped and compared based on density, proximity, as well as demographic, climate, multimodal systems, university-specific, health, and land use factors, in order to determine commonalities in existing bike-friendly areas.																			0733-9488	1943-5444				JUN 1	2021	147	2							04021007	10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000669													WOS:000648590100013

Although several studies suggest increased thermo-erosion as a result of recent warming, a long-term context is necessary to assess the linkages of thermokarst processes with climate variability. We analyzed sediment cores from two lakes on the Alaskan North Slope (USA), one with (Lake NE14) and one without (Perch Lake) watershed thermo-erosion. Distinct geochemical and lithological characteristics provide evidence for sedimentary input from carbonate-rich permafrost soils associated with past retrogressive thaw slumping at Lake NE14 but not at Perch Lake. These characteristics include increases in Ca:Sr, Ca:K, carbonate:[feldspar + clay minerals], percent CaCO3, and delta C-13, and decreases in Sr-87:Sr-86. At least ten episodes of thermo-erosion occurred over the past 6000 yr at Lake NE14. Most of these episodes coincided with periods of elevated summer temperatures, but moisture variation and geomorphic factors likely played a role in driving their occurrence. Our results suggest that positive feedbacks facilitate reactivation of thermo-erosion in ice-rich terrain, adding to the growing body of evidence that these Arctic landscapes are unstable in a changing climate.

These maturing eels were all females with gonads developed at a similar stage as other migrating eels in the estuary. Fluorescent oxytetracycline marks observed on the otoliths allowed us to assert without any doubt that they came from glass eels caught in Nova Scotia and stocked 4 years earlier in the Richelieu River, 500 km upstream from the recapture location. Their length varied between 570 and 668 mm, which is within the size range of naturally recruited female silver eels in Nova Scotia, while silver eel are most generally longer than 80 cm in the St. Lawrence estuary. Their growth rate was also exceptionally fast. This direct observation is the first evidence that American eels stocked as glass eels can migrate seaward at least as far as the estuary in synchrony with naturally recruited female silver eels en route to their spawning grounds in the Sargasso Sea.

Lake trout reflex impairment and physiological status following ice-angling	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We examined behaviour and physiology of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) following ice-angling. Fish were ice-angled and placed in a water-filled tub for 0.5, 4, and 6 h to recover (n = 19). Reflex impairment and physiological status were assessed repeatedly for every individual. Longer fight times lead to higher lactate and glucose, and lower extracellular pH 0.5 h postangling. Loss of orientation was the most common reflex impairment (84% of fish) 4 h post-angling. Mortality (36.8%) was observed during the study; however, variation in handling, barotrauma, and issues with sampling may have confounded angling effects. To determine if barotrauma impacted impairment and mortality, lake trout at a later sampling date (n = 29) were exposed to air for either 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 420 s before assessment (3.4% mortality). For fish air-exposed for 300 s or more, 14% lost orientation during immediate assessment. Bloating occurred in 20% of fish air-exposed for 60 s. An air exposure duration of 420 s significantly impaired reflexes. Recreationally caught lake trout show behavioural and physiological impairment with such impairments magnified by extended air exposure.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Hasler, Caleb/0000-0003-3242-7415; Navarroli, Giulio/0000-0003-3486-474X; Howell, Bradley/0000-0001-8552-6957													0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2023	80	10					1547	1561		10.1139/cjfas-2023-0037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2023-0037		JUL 2023											WOS:001041750800001

Remote sensing technology is considered an effective means of algal bloom detection. This study proposed a novel algal bloom detection index (ABDI) based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. The ABDI was evaluated by application to Hulun Lake, China. Areas of algal bloom detected by the ABDI were consistent with those identified from visual interpretation maps [the coefficient of determination = 0.87; root-mean-square error = 0.67 km(2); overall accuracy >98%; Kappa coefficient >0.88]. The ABDI was less sensitive to thin cloud and turbid water compared to the floating algae index (FAI), adjusted floating algae index (AFAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Algal bloom dynamics in relation to meteorological factors in Hulun Lake were analysed using time-series MSI data, which indicated that algal blooms occurred mainly in summer and were distributed in the near-shore waters. Temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration, and wind speed as well as human activities were found to influence spatio-temporal patterns of algal blooms. The results indicate that ABDI is applicable to the detection of algal blooms under a variety of environmental conditions occurring in other regions, such as in the Taihu, Dianchi, and Chaohu lakes and the Yellow Sea. The results of this study can provide an operational algorithm for the detection of algal blooms and environmental management.					cao, mengmeng/HJB-1637-2022	Cao, Mengmeng/0000-0003-4178-7105													0143-1161	1366-5901				JUN 18	2021	42	12					4514	4535		10.1080/01431161.2021.1897186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2021.1897186													WOS:000628022800001

Open ocean dead zones in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Here we present first observations, from instrumentation installed on moorings and a float, of unexpectedly low (< 2 mu mol kg(-1)) oxygen environments in the open waters of the tropical North Atlantic, a region where oxygen concentration does normally not fall much below 40 mu mol kg(-1). The low-oxygen zones are created at shallow depth, just below the mixed layer, in the euphotic zone of cyclonic eddies and anticyclonic-modewater eddies. Both types of eddies are prone to high surface productivity. Net respiration rates for the eddies are found to be 3 to 5 times higher when compared with surrounding waters. Oxygen is lowest in the centre of the eddies, in a depth range where the swirl velocity, defining the transition between eddy and surroundings, has its maximum. It is assumed that the strong velocity at the outer rim of the eddies hampers the transport of properties across the eddies boundary and as such isolates their cores. This is supported by a remarkably stable hydrographic structure of the eddies core over periods of several months. The eddies propagate westward, at about 4 to 5 km day 1, from their generation region off the West African coast into the open ocean. High productivity and accompanying respiration, paired with sluggish exchange across the eddy boundary, create the "dead zone" inside the eddies, so far only reported for coastal areas or lakes. We observe a direct impact of the open ocean dead zones on the marine ecosystem as such that the diurnal vertical migration of zooplankton is suppressed inside the eddies.

In this study, pharyngeal swabs from 83 subjects working in an open air farmer's market were sampled before and after exposure to smog with PM2.5 and PM10 levels up to 200 and 300 mu g/m(3), respectively. Their microbiota were investigated using high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The genus level phylotypes was increased from 649 to 767 in the post-smog pharyngeal microbiota, of which 142 were new and detected only in the post-smog microbiota. The 142 new genera were traced to sources such as soil, marine, feces, sewage sludge, freshwater, hot springs, and saline lakes. The abundance of the genera Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Moraxella, and Staphylococcus increased in the post-smog pharyngeal microbiota. All six alpha diversity indices and principal component analysis showed that the taxonomic composition of the post-smog pharyngeal microbiota was significantly different to that of the pre-smog pharyngeal microbiota. Redundancy analysis showed that the influences of PM2.5/PM10 exposure and smoking on the taxonomic composition of the pharyngeal microbiota were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Two days of exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5/PM10 changed the pharyngeal microbiota profiles, which may lead to an increase in respiratory diseases. Wearing masks could reduce the effect of high-level PM2.5/PM10 exposure on the pharyngeal microbiota.

Owing to its small size ruffe has little value for commercial or recreational fisheries today. However, due to their high abundance, ruffe play an important role in the food webs of both lakes. The aim of the investigation was to establish the proportion of ruffe in the fish community and to assess the wellbeing of this fish in the two lakes on the basis of growth rate and condition factor. According to experimental catches made in autumn 1998-2002, the average total catch of fishes per trawl-hour (CPUE) in L. Peipsi was about two times higher than in L. Vortsjarv (204 kg and 105 kg, respectively). CPUE of ruffe made up 16 kg in L. Peipsi and 7 kg in L. Vortsjarv. In these lakes the fish community composition and food resource appear to be different. Benthivorous fishes were dominating in L. Vortsjarv and the biomass of macrozoobenthos was significantly lower in this lake than in L. Peipsi. In the first year, the growth rate of ruffe was higher in L. Peipsi where the state of zooplankton was better compared with L. Vortsjarv. Differences in the linear growth rate of older fishes in L. Peipsi and L. Vortsjarv were not significant. The lower condition factor of ruffe in L. Vortsjarv reflects the limited food resource of abundant benthivorous fishes in this lake. Different trophic relationships in Estonian large lakes are better reflected in the ruffe's condition factor than in its linear growth rate.

Metatranscriptomic Evidence for Co-Occurring Top-Down and Bottom-Up Controls on Toxic Cyanobacterial Communities	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Little is known about the molecular and physiological function of co-occurring microbes within freshwater cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs). To address this, community metatranscriptomes collected from the western basin of Lake Erie during August 2012 were examined. Using sequence data, we tested the hypothesis that the activity of the microbial community members is independent of community structure. Predicted metabolic and physiological functional profiles from spatially distinct metatranscriptomes were determined to be >= 90% similar between sites. Targeted analysis of Microcystis aeruginosa, the historical causative agent of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms over the past similar to 20 years, as well as analysis of Planktothrix agardhii and Anabaena cylindrica, revealed ongoing transcription of genes involved in microcystin toxin synthesis as well as the acquisition of both nitrogen and phosphorus, nutrients often implicated as independent bottom-up drivers of eutrophication in aquatic systems. Transcription of genes involved in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and metabolism also provided support for the alternate hypothesis that high-pH conditions and dense algal biomass result in CO2-limiting conditions that further favor cyanobacterial dominance. Additionally, the presence of Microcystis-specific cyanophage sequences provided preliminary evidence of possible top-down virus-mediated control of cHAB populations. Overall, these data provide insight into the complex series of constraints associated with Microcystis blooms that dominate the western basin of Lake Erie during summer months, demonstrating that multiple environmental factors work to shape the microbial community.					; Wilhelm, Steven/B-8963-2008	Belisle, Bernard/0000-0002-9559-4344; Steffen, Morgan/0000-0001-9755-9879; Boyer, Gregory/0000-0003-4490-5461; Wilhelm, Steven/0000-0001-6283-8077													0099-2240	1098-5336				MAY	2015	81	9					3268	3276		10.1128/AEM.04101-14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.04101-14								25662977					WOS:000352652400031
J	Axler, RP; Reuter, JE				Axler, RP; Reuter, JE			Nitrate uptake by phytoplankton and periphyton: Whole-lake enrichments and mesocosm-N-15 experiments in an oligotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Periphyton nitrate uptake and denitrification, not phytoplankton assimilation, accounted for similar to 90% and 73% of the depletion of similar to 35 mu g NO3-N liter(-1) added as whole-epilimnion enrichments of ammonium nitrate to Castle Lake, California, in midsummer 1980 and 1981. The importance of benthic processes is suggested by similar rates of depletion for nitrate and ammonium in the whole-lake experiments; these rates are inconsistent with previous microcosm studies of phytoplankton that showed strong preferential uptake of ammonium and low uptake rates of nitrate. The importance of the benthic pathways was confirmed by an (NH4SNO3)-S-15 mesocosm experiment, which simulated the whole-epilimnion experiments. Less than 9% of the N-15 transformed was associated with water-column pools; the remainder was incorporated into epipelic periphyton and sediments (56%) or attributed to N-15(2)-(N2O)-N-15 loss via denitrification. Historical analysis of nitrate depletion in the epilimnion during spring suggests that periphyton may outcompete phytoplankton for water-column nutrients.																			0024-3590					JUN	1996	41	4					659	671		10.4319/lo.1996.41.4.0659	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.4.0659													WOS:A1996VD30600007

The severity of this mortality was not consistently related to spawning success, as measured by densities of age-0 fish in spring block-net samples before the periods of heavy mortality. High-mortality periods typically coincided with diet shifts towards piscivory. Age-0 largemouth bass exhibited the least piscivory at the same time that biomass ratios of available fish prey to predators were lowest in the two years (1980, 1981) they were measured. The lowest observed prey: predator ratios also preceded periods of major mortality. This period of density reduction was accompanied by a significant reduction in percentage fat of age-0 fish in 1980 and 1982, but not in 1981. The major reductions in density of age-0 largemouth bass between May and July were believed to represent a survival bottleneck that should be considered in conjunction with stock assessment and management efforts directed at this species.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	1987	116	2					264	271		10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<264:RAFCCF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<264:RAFCCF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1987M621500013

It is a small sample of the fauna that had colonized the region after deglaciation and although the species are extant, the assemblage is a surprising mixture of faunistic elements for which there is no known modern analog. Species with wide-spread boreal, arctic-alpine, northwestern boreal, southern boreal, and eastern distributions are recorded. The present ecologic and geographic distributions of the species indicate a valley environment with similar habitat diversity and climate to those which characterize the tundra-forest transition zone of northern Canada. This interpretation is supported by macroscopic plant evidence but conflicts with pollen evidence which implies a climate with warmer summers. To resolve the problem, it is proposed that the valley fauna and flora survived in an isolated cold microenvironment surrounded by regionally warmer conditions and for which analogies presently exist on the north and east shores of Lake Superior.																			0008-4077	1480-3313					1977	14	7					1625	1634		10.1139/e77-138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e77-138													WOS:A1977DP02300011

CW-Rs consist of a series of treatment units and have been reported to reduce the concentration of major nutrients. The efficiency of CW-Rs in mitigating odor compounds and their producer(s) remains largely unclear. In this study, Yanlonghu CW-R located in Jiangsu province, eastern China, was selected to monitor the occurrence and dynamics of 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB). Two peaks of 2-MIB, attributed mainly to Pseudanabaena in April, and Pseudanabaena and Oscillatoria in July, were observed. This indicated that benthic Oscillatoria is also a threatening factor and should be considered. The concentrations of 2-MIB at the inlet and outlet were 9.75 and 50.08 ng/L in April and 73.11 and 25.21 ng/L in July, respectively. Yanlonghu CW-R was reported to be effective in reducing the content of major nutrients (total phosphorus in particular) throughout the year. In addition, it was effective in mitigating the levels of 2-MIB-producers/2-MIB during the summer season. It is proposed that qPCR for mic gene detection can be performed to screen and establish an early warning method. We revealed that the 2-MIB episode is related to the function of the CW-R, which is shown to be different from what is known in lakes or reservoirs. It is emphasized that each treatment unit of CW-R should be maintained at full capacity so that the frequency and hazardous effects caused by 2-MIB in the system can be controlled or reduced. This finding is implicated in the control strategy selection and contributes to the better management and improvement of future applications.					; Zhang, Qi/JEP-7674-2023; Liu, Shengbo/JAZ-9733-2023; SUN, Jiaxin/LCE-2246-2024	Li, Lin/0000-0002-4703-6786; 														2073-4441				SEP	2022	14	17							2670	10.3390/w14172670	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14172670													WOS:000851996500001

Colloidal associations of major and trace elements in the snow pack across a 2800-km south-north gradient of western Siberia	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Colloidal (size 1 nm to 1 mu m) transport of major and trace elements, notably micronutrients and low-solubility geochemical tracers, is a ubiquitous and well-established feature for all surface and soil waters in boreal and subarctic regions. However, little is known on the colloidal associations of organic carbon (OC) and major and trace elements in atmospheric precipitation such as snow. This is despite significant efforts devoted to distinguishing the soluble and particulate transport of trace metals and contaminants by atmospheric aerosols. To acquire a snap-shot of major and trace element size fractionation in the snow cover of western Siberia, we sampled snow cores integrated over the entire depth (0-50 cm until bottom) across a sizable (2800 km) south - north transect in the Ob River watershed (western Siberia). A number of trace metal pollutants (Cr, Ni, Zn, Cd) exhibited significant linkage, pronounced over the first 20 km, to sources of local pollution. Some elements (P, Mn, Zn, Ba) also demonstrated an increase in their colloidal fraction in the proximity of pollution centers, possibly reflecting input from industrial centers and gas flares. Following centrifuginal ultrafiltration, we analyzed total dissolved (< 0.22 mu m), two colloidal (high molecular weight, HMW50 kDa ? 0.22 mu m; medium molecular weight MMW3 kDa ? 50 kDa) and low molecular weight (LMW < 3 kDa) fractions in the melted snow for all major and trace elements. We discovered sizable (20 to 70%) proportion of some major (Ca, SO4) and many trace (Fe, Y, Zn, Sb, La, Ce, Yb, Pb) elements in the colloidal (3 kDa - 0.22 mu m) form, without significant link to latitude, type of biome, or the concentration of possible colloidal carrier (DOC, Fe, Al, Ca, SO4). The origin of snow water colloids in snow can be hypothesized to stem from solute freezing on lake surfaces (Fe, OC), frost flowers of the Ar?tic ice (Ca, SO4), clays dispersion (Al, Si) and sulphur dioxide oxidation particles (SO4, oxyanions). Via hydrochemical mass balance calculations, we demonstrate an overwhelming impact of snow melt on spring-time riverine export of Cd, Pb, Zn, As, Sb and Cs. These preliminary results call for further studies of atmospheric colloids including those originating from rainwater.

J	Bunt, C				Bunt, Christopher			Silver Shiner (Notropis photogenis) Size-Class Structure, Habitat Utilization, Movement and Persistence in an Urbanized Fragment of a Great Lakes Tributary	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Silver Shiners (Notropis photogenis) were monitored with underwater videography, captured and measured, and their habitat was characterized from 38 locations in an urbanized fragment of the Grand River, Ontario, from 2006 to 2015. Cobble was the most frequently used substrate type (44.6% of observations) in heterogeneous transitional habitat near backwater pools and areas adjacent to deep runs. Population size structure and qualitative growth patterns suggested rapid growth during the first 2 y after hatching (n = 439). The largest fish captured was 143 mm total length, which is a new Canadian record and tied the world record from Tennessee. Spawning was not directly observed, but gamete evidence suggested it took place from early to mid-June when the water temperature was approximately 24 C. Underwater video monitoring revealed schools of Silver Shiners migrating upstream during late afternoon and evening in October/November presumably to overwintering areas. Silver Shiners were located near known sources of groundwater seepage in 92% of observations. This association requires further investigation to determine if groundwater represents critical habitat that facilitates persistence of Silver Shiner populations in urbanized rivers with notoriously poor water quality.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				OCT	2016	176	2					200	209		10.1674/0003-0031-176.2.200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-176.2.200													WOS:000385854000003

Recognizing cross-ecosystem responses to changing temperatures: soil warming impacts pelagic food webs	OIKOS												The energy and materials that move across ecosystem boundaries influence food web structure and key ecosystem functions. Despite the acknowledged importance of such ecological subsidies, surprisingly little information is available regarding the role of environmental temperature in influencing subsidy quality and the response of the recipient ecosystem. We evaluated the impacts of temperature-mediated changes in leaves from deciduous trees, an important subsidy from terrestrial to freshwater ecosystems, on both the producer-based and detritivore-based components of a pelagic pond food web in a field mesocosm experiment. We hypothesized that variation in leaf chemistry driven by increased soil temperature would alter both the quality of leaf subsidies and the pond response. We collected red maple Acer rubrum leaves from heated and ambient temperature plots from the long-term soil warming experiment at the Harvard Experimental Forest and added them to 167-l field mesocosms containing established plankton communities, creating 'no leaf ', 'ambient leaf ' and 'heated leaf ' treatments during autumn 2012. We then monitored physical, chemical, and biological responses to treatments until the mesocosms froze six weeks later. Experimental soil warming altered the chemical composition of deciduous leaves, the physical and chemical environment of the aquatic ecosystems to which leaves were added, and the pelagic pond food webs as measured by community composition. Compared to leaves from ambient-temperature soils, leaves from warmed soils initially resulted in lower water column phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon, reducing bacterial densities. However, the diminished carbon and phosphorus resulting from soil warming also increased light availability that ultimately stimulated cladoceran zooplankton relative to ambient-temperature leaves. Our results suggest that changes in temperature can alter ecological subsidies in unanticipated ways, and suggest that accurately predicting the potential consequences of climate change will require conducting research across ecosystem boundaries.					; Cottingham, Kathryn/AAV-3934-2021; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024	McMahon, Katherine D./0000-0002-7038-026X; Cottingham, Kathryn/0000-0003-3169-5047; 													0030-1299	1600-0706				NOV	2015	124	11					1473	1481		10.1111/oik.01939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.01939													WOS:000363866900007
J	Riffell, SK				Riffell, SK			Road mortality of dragonflies (Odonata) in a Great Lakes coastal wetland	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												Although road mortality of vertebrates has been well studied, road mortality of invertebrates has rarely been studied or considered in management scenarios. Mackinac Bay is an extensive coastal wetland in northern Michigan. It is bordered by a two-lane paved highway that separates the marsh, where dragonflies defend territories and breed, from the adjacent forest where dragonflies forage and rest. During mid-summer of 1997, daily collections of dragonfly corpses from the road and road edge were used to estimate daily mortality rates and sex ratios among casualties. Daily mortality was highly variable, ranging from 10 to 256 casualties per kilometer. Sex ratios among casualties were generally male-skewed (60% or higher). Life-history differences between the sexes present a parsimonious explanation for male-specific mortality. Mortality was even or female-skewed fdr some species, and impacts of road mortality may be more severe in populations where mortality is female-skewed. More research about the effects of roads on dragonflies is warranted because dragonfly populations are small relative to many invertebrates and are restricted to wetland habitats which are being degraded or destroyed in many regions.																			0090-0222					SPR-SUM	1999	32	1-2					63	73																WOS:000084149500009

Despite knowing that the spatial extent of the calibration-set affects the reconstruction result, guidance is lacking as to how to determine a suitable spatial extent of the pollen-climate calibration-set. In this study, past mean annual precipitation (P-ann) during the Holocene (since 11.5 cal ka BP) is reconstructed repeatedly for pollen records from Qinghai Lake (36.7 degrees N, 100.5 degrees E; north-east Tibetan Plateau), Gonghai Lake (38.9 degrees N, 112.2 degrees E; north China) and Sihailongwan Lake (42.3 degrees N, 126.6 degrees E; north-east China) using calibration-sets of varying spatial extents extracted from the modern pollen dataset of China and Mongolia (2559 sampling sites and 168 pollen taxa in total). Results indicate that the spatial extent of the calibration-set has a strong impact on model performance, analogue quality and reconstruction diagnostics (absolute value, range, trend, optimum). Generally, these effects are stronger with the modern analogue technique (MAT) than with weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS). With respect to fossil spectra from northern China, the spatial extent of calibration-sets should be restricted to radii between ca. 1000 and 1500 km because small-scale calibration-sets (<800 km radius) will likely fail to include enough spatial variation in the modern pollen assemblages to reflect the temporal range shifts during the Holocene, while too broad a scale calibration-set (>1500 km radius) will include taxa with very different pollen-climate relationships.

The waterbodies show great variation of environmental parameters within small scales of time and space. The two first axes of the PCA analysis (52.74 % of total variance) are related to water turnover rate and eutrophy, respectively. Cluster analysis of physical and chemical data produced five groups of sites, each typifying a particular hydrological dynamics: confined coastal waters, semi-confined waters with marine and continental influence, freshwater coastal lagoons with high nutrient inputs, fluctuating freshwater systems and freshwater springs. A model for alternative dominance of phytoplankton-periphyton-macrophytes is described on the basis of two main gradients defined by the first two PCA axes. The model describes a horseshoe curve where, at each extreme, with maximal water turnover and or maximal confinement, macrophytes dominate. In states of intermediate turnover the degree of eutrophy increases and phytoplankton dominates.

An outburst could lead to a disastrous debris flow rushing and stores a water volume of about 32 million m down to the Marsyangdi Valley destroying villages and infra-structure, and damage the existing hydropower installations. The results of an interdisciplinary study by an international team of scientists were in part surprising: different from other glacier lakes the Thulagi glacier lake is not dammed by moraines but by an old, thick, and slow-melting dead ice body. The breaching of a damning terminal moraine can be excluded under the present conditions since the melting rate of the buried ice body is very low. Moreover, the most common triggering mechanism of a surge wave, an ice surge from the glacier, can be ruled out. However, the hazard of an unstable rockslope able to fall into the lake has been identified. The resulting surge wave could cause a local debris flow which would be however one order of magnitude smaller than that of a GLOF event.																					90-5410-990-4				1998							2209	2215																WOS:000078260900305

High Arctic lakes as sentinel ecosystems: Cascading regime shifts in climate, ice cover, and mixing	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate and cryospheric observations have shown that the high Arctic has experienced several decades of rapid environmental change, with warming rates well above the global average. In this study, we address the hypothesis that this climatic warming affects deep, ice-covered lakes in the region by causing abrupt, threshold-dependent shifts rather than slow, continuous responses. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data show that lakes (one freshwater and four permanently stratified) on Ellesmere Island at the far northern coastline of Canada have experienced significant reductions in summer ice cover over the last decade. The stratified lakes were characterized by strong biogeochemical gradients, yet temperature and salinity profiles of their upper water columns (5-20 m) indicated recent mixing, consistent with loss of their perennial ice and exposure to wind. Although subject to six decades of warming at a rate of 0.5 degrees C decade(-1), these lakes were largely unaffected until a regime shift in air temperature in the 1980s and 1990s, when warming crossed a critical threshold forcing the loss of ice cover. This transition from perennial to annual ice cover caused another regime shift whereby previously stable upper water columns were subjected to mixing. Far northern lakes are responding discontinuously to climate-driven change via a cascade of regime shifts and have an indicator value beyond the regional scale.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Antoniades, Dermot/0000-0001-6629-4839; Mueller, Derek/0000-0003-1974-319X													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2009	54	6	2				2371	2385		10.4319/lo.2009.54.6_part_2.2371	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.54.6_part_2.2371													WOS:000272785700008

In this study we tested the hypotheses that (1) females are utilizing habitats influenced by discharging groundwater and that (2) there is a reproductive advantage to spawning at these selected sites. Embryo survival was assessed by placing fertilized eggs in capsules that could be retrieved once they were placed in selected and nonselected locations. The survival rate was significantly higher (88.6 vs. 76.1%) and less variable in the selected area, but alevin lengths did not differ significantly between areas. The selected areas were, on average, locations of groundwater discharge and higher water temperatures over the incubation period, while nonselected locations were in areas of surface-water recharge and lower water temperatures. The results suggest that appropriate reproductive habitats which offer the best incubation environments may be limited in bull trout systems, and that site selection by females may increase fitness and be critical for population viability.																			0008-4301					AUG	1999	77	8					1233	1239		10.1139/cjz-77-8-1233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-77-8-1233													WOS:000083757200008
J	Cao, Y; Li, W; Jeppesen, E				Cao, Yu; Li, Wei; Jeppesen, Erik			The response of two submerged macrophytes and periphyton to elevated temperatures in the presence and absence of snails: a microcosm approach	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Global warming may affect snail-periphyton-macrophyte relationships in lakes with implications also for water clarity. We conducted a 40-day aquaria experiment to elucidate the response of submerged macrophytes and periphyton on real and artificial plants to elevated temperatures (3A degrees C) under eutrophic conditions, with and without snails present. With snails, the biomass and length of Vallisneria spinulosa leaves increased more at the high temperature, and at both temperatures growth was higher than in absence of snails. The biomass of periphyton on V. spinulosa as well as on artificial plants was higher at the highest temperature in the absence but not in the presence of snails. The biomass of Potamogeton crispus (in a decaying state) declined in all treatments and was not affected by temperature or snails. While total snail biomass did not differ between temperatures, lower abundance of adults (size > 1 cm) was observed at the high temperatures. We conclude that the effect of elevated temperature on the snail-periphyton-macrophyte relationship in summer differs among macrophyte species in active growth or senescent species in subtropical lakes and that snails, when abundant, improve the chances of maintaining actively growing macrophytes under eutrophic conditions, and more so in a warmer future with potentially denser growth of periphyton.

We used data from breeding waterfowl surveys in Michigan and Wisconsin during 1993 to 2002 and digital wetland data within buffered transect routes to develop a predictive model of mallard distribution within the 5 Great Lake States. The most parsimonious model based on AICc was used to map predictive distributions of breeding mallards. Based on the positive influence of palustrine emergent, palustrine unknown and palustrine unconsolidated shore and th negative influence of palustrine forested wetlands, the highest densities of breeding mallards were predicted in southeastern Wisconsin and southeastern Michigan. Additionally, we flew helicopter surveys in spring of 2003 to characterize wetland basins used by mallard pairs. Individual pairs were observed most often on small palustrine emergent and palustrine forested wetlands. The resulting models and maps can be used by a variety of agencies to plan conservation and management actions for mallards breeding in the Great Lakes States.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2007	157	2					356	364		10.1674/0003-0031(2007)157[356:PDACOW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2007)157[356:PDACOW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000246427600008
J	Davids, JC; Mehl, SW				Davids, Jeffrey C.; Mehl, Steffen W.			Sustainable Capture: Concepts for Managing Stream-Aquifer Systems	GROUNDWATER												Most surface water bodies (i.e., streams, lakes, etc.) are connected to the groundwater system to some degree so that changes to surface water bodies (either diversions or importations) can change flows in aquifer systems, and pumping from an aquifer can reduce discharge to, or induce additional recharge from streams, springs, and lakes. The timescales of these interactions are often very long (decades), making sustainable management of these systems difficult if relying only on observations of system responses. Instead, management scenarios are often analyzed based on numerical modeling. In this paper we propose a framework and metrics that can be used to relate the Theis concepts of capture to sustainable measures of stream-aquifer systems. We introduce four concepts: Sustainable Capture Fractions, Sustainable Capture Thresholds, Capture Efficiency, and Sustainable Groundwater Storage that can be used as the basis for developing metrics for sustainable management of stream-aquifer systems. We demonstrate their utility on a hypothetical stream-aquifer system where pumping captures both streamflow and discharge to phreatophytes at different amounts based on pumping location. In particular, Capture Efficiency (CE) can be easily understood by both scientists and non-scientist alike, and readily identifies vulnerabilities to sustainable stream-aquifer management when its value exceeds 100%.																			0017-467X	1745-6584				NOV-DEC	2015	53	6					851	858		10.1111/gwat.12297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12297								25406597					WOS:000363894200006

Probabilities of monthly median chlorophyll-a concentrations in subarctic, temperate and subtropical lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												High concentrations of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) during summer are by definition a common problem in eutrophicated lakes. Several models have been designed to predict chl-a concentrations but are unable to estimate the probability of predicted concentrations or concentration spans during subsequent months. Two different methods were developed to compute the probabilities of obtaining a certain chl-a concentration. One method is built on discrete Markov chains and the other method on a direct relationship between median chl-a concentrations from two months. Lake managers may use these methods to detect and counteract the risk of high chl-a concentrations and algal blooms during coming months. Both methods were evaluated and applied along different scenarios to detect the probability to exceed chl-a concentration in different coming months. The procedure of computing probabilities is strictly based on general statistics which means that neither method is constrained for chl-a but can also be used for other variables. A user-friendly software application was developed to facilitate and extend the use of these two methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Reduced manganese (Mn2+) and nitrogen (NH4+) which were always accumulated in pore waters were detected little in the overlying lake water, which suggested the prevalence of Mn2+- and NH4+-oxidizing microbial activities at the sediment surface. This was proved by adding biological inhibitors such as azide to intact mud samples which induced rapid emission of Mn2+ and NH4+ from sediment to overlying water. Using data of emission or uptake rates by sediment of Mn2+, NH4+, NO2- and NO3- in the presence and absence of inhibitors, the rates of manganese oxidation, nitrification and denitrification were estimated by mass balance calculation over a one-year cycle. Both manganese oxidation and nitrification rates were found to decline towards the end of the stagnation period. This is presumably due to decrease in the oxygen availability at the sediment surface in this season, though the hypolimnetic oxygen concentration had never fell to zero. Concomitantly, denitrification rate was also lowered which resulted in enhancement of the regeneration of NH4+ from sediment to lake water. Of the whole oxygen consumption below the thermocline during the stagnation period, 9.5, 3.4 and 0.6 % were ascribed to nitrification in the hypolimnetic water, nitrification at the sediment surface and.manganese oxidation at the sediment surface, respectively. When comparing with the nitrogen economy of this lake found in literature, denitrification proved to have removed about half of nitrogen input to this lake.																			0003-9136					MAY	1994	130	3					303	324																WOS:A1994NQ45700004

Patterns of total algal biovolume on sediments were not strongly related to these habitat conditions because of masking by algae that probably settled from the plankton onto sediments. Biovolumes of "benthic" algae generally decreased with depth; however, weak and positive correlations between biovolumes of some benthic algal taxa and depth indicated that benthic algae had adapted to low light conditions and were perhaps facultatively heterotrophic. Decreases in diatom and increases in blue-green algal biovolumes with total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations in lake water indicated that blue-green algae were better adapted for sequestering nutrients in low light environments. The variability in patterns of algal biovolume with acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and pH indicated that algae had adapted well to different levels of ANC and pH. Biovolumes of blue-green were negatively correlated with ANC, primarily because of the high biovolumes of various blue-green algae that occurred sporadically in lakes with ANC between 0 and 20 .mu.eg/L and pH between 5.8 and 6.0. Diatom biovolumes generally increased with ANC and pH; however, biovolumes of several species of diatoms, including a Pinnularia, were greatest in low ANC and pH lakes. In general, Eunotia biovolumes decreased and Navicula and Pinnularia biovolumes increased with ANC and pH.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	9					1501	1512		10.1139/f85-188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-188													WOS:A1985AQF9100006

There was a marked increase in seal abundance in the fall (from <200 to >900 seals), and as seal abundance increased, the average number of seals per iceberg remained relatively constant (10 +/- 1 seals/iceberg), while the average number of icebergs occupied increased (from 12 to 48 icebergs in 2002). In 2003 the number of icebergs used was lower, and therefore seal density per berg was higher, than in 2002, suggesting that the availability of suitable ice influences grouping behavior in harbor seals. Diet and genetic studies suggest that harbor seals move into Vitus Lake from stocks in both Southeast Alaska and Prince William Sound in order to forage on local salmon runs. These findings have implications for ongoing efforts to determine appropriate stock structure for management decisions and suggest that the frequency and extent of seasonal movements must be considered when conducting regional population monitoring surveys. As human activity in the Bering Glacier area increases, monitoring and educational efforts should be initiated in order to ensure that harbor seals remain a functioning element of the ecosystem.					; Burns, Jennifer/C-4159-2013	Burns, Jennifer/0000-0001-9652-2943; 													0072-1077		978-0-8137-2462-1				2010	462						181	191		10.1130/2010.2462(09)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2010.2462(09)													WOS:000286213100012
J	Henriksen, A; Kirkhusmo, LA				Henriksen, A; Kirkhusmo, LA			Effects of clear-cutting of forest on the chemistry of a shallow groundwater aquifer in southern Norway	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												As part of the national monitoring programme for long-range transported air pollutants, four groundwater aquifers in southern Norway were monitored for acidification trends during the period 1980-1995. For the monitoring station, Langvasslia in south eastern Norway sampling continued until the end of 1999. This groundwater aquifer is about 3 km north east of the calibrated catchment Lake Langtjern. The catchment of the groundwater aquifer, covered completely by Norway spruce, was clear-cut in September 1986 and was treated with glyphosate in the summer, 1991. The chemical effects on the chemistry of the groundwater are generally similar to those observed in stream-water from clear-cut areas: increases in water runoff, water temperature, concentrations of K, NO3, and organic carbon (TOC), and decrease in SO4 concentration. In the groundwater aquifer, inorganic Al and ANC increased more than would have been expected without clear-cutting. By 1999 NO3 concentrations were nearly the same as prior to clear-cutting, whereas K still was elevated.																			1027-5606	1607-7938				JUN	2000	4	2					323	331		10.5194/hess-4-323-2000	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-4-323-2000													WOS:000090061500011
J	Shore, JA				Shore, Jennifer A.			Modelling the circulation and exchange of Kingston Basin and Lake Ontario with FVCOM	OCEAN MODELLING												An unstructured grid, finite-volume, 3-dimensional primitive equation, sigma-coordinate terrain following ocean model (FVCOM) has been applied to Lake Ontario to investigate its monthly climatological circulation with a focus on Kingston Basin. Kingston Basin, in the northeastern end of Lake Ontario, sits between the main body of the lake and the outflowing St. Lawrence River and is adjacent to the Bay of Quinte Area of Concern designated by the International joint Commission. The focus of this study is to use the unstructured model FVCOM to model the mean circulation in the Basin. Results showed that the FVCOM model can take up to 3 years to spin-up from rest for a wind-forced, almost fully enclosed lake model. The model accurately reproduced the current flow field within the main body of the lake and compared favourably to the flow field observed during the International Field Year for the Great Lakes (IFYGL) in Kingston Basin. Transport streamfunction results show that the structure of the flow into Kingston Basin from the main body of the lake changes throughout the year. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Samples were taken at different stations along the reservoir and diatoms were persistent in the epilimnion and were the main phytoplankton component, with a peak of abundance up to similar to 5 10(5) particles ml(-1). The diatom growth during the initiation of the summer bloom was high in the reservoir upstream concurrent with maximum Chlorophyll a concentrations. A delay in the onset of the diatom bloom, together with lower values of the volume concentration, was found in 1999 compared to the results in 2000 and was attributed to the different stratification of the reservoir as a result of meteorological conditions. The diatom population sank from the epilimnion by sedimentation and formed aggregates that accumulated at the bottom of the epilimnion. Sedimentation to the hypolimnion occurred at the end of the bloom, where peaks of Chlorophyll a were found.					; Colomer, Jordi/Y-5386-2018; Serra, Teresa/L-9279-2014	casamitjana, xavier/0000-0003-1662-9076; Soler, Marianna/0000-0001-8422-1609; Colomer, Jordi/0000-0002-9330-0269; Serra, Teresa/0000-0002-6075-5849													0018-8158					DEC	2002	489	1-3					235	244		10.1023/A:1023269202656	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023269202656													WOS:000182135700025
J	FEE, EJ; HECKY, RE				FEE, EJ; HECKY, RE			INTRODUCTION TO THE NORTHWEST ONTARIO LAKE SIZE SERIES (NOLSS)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The rationale, design, and limitations of the Northwest Ontario Lake Size Series (NOLSS) research program are described. The primary purpose of NOLSS is to discover how lake size per se influences limnological and fisheries phenomena, so that conclusions drawn from studies of particular lakes can be rigorously scaled and applied to lakes of other sizes. NOLSS consists of six lakes located in a remote wilderness region of Northwest Ontario. These lakes were chosen for their geological, hydrological, and morphological similarity (Canadian Shield geology; water renewal time >5 yr; fully stratified in summer), but they form an exponential gradient in-surface area (from 89 to 34 700 ha.) Associated with this gradient of lake size are gradients of physical properties (turbulent energy, mixing depth, thermal behaviour) to which biological communities must adapt. NOLSS fills the conspicuous gap in size that separates two well-studied groups of lakes in Northwest Ontario: the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), where whole-lake manipulation experiments are performed, and the Laurentian Great Lakes (Nipigon, Superior), where these experiments find some of their most important applications.																			0706-652X					DEC	1992	49	12					2434	2444		10.1139/f92-269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-269													WOS:A1992KL53200001

Such a process eventually leads to the short-term effects of cyanobacteria blooms in eutrophic lakes and the long-term effects of changes in the structure and quantity of lake species. It is of great scientific significance to understand the heat exchange process between surface air, underlying surface, and surface runoff and reveal the thermal runoff formation mechanism. In this study, the heat transfer models between land, surface-air, and surface-water were implemented, aiming to quantify the heating process of surface runoff caused by surface heat load under real conditions. The results show that the two established models can accurately simulate the heat exchange process. Based on our model simulations and field measurements, we analyzed the impact of weather conditions, hydrological conditions, and underlying surface types on runoff temperature. The study finds that the initial surface temperature, wind speed, rainfall intensity, thermal conductivity, and the underlying surface's water permeability can explain 95.4% and 91.9% of the observed differences in surface runoff heating and temperature increase rate, respectively. The initial surface temperature is the most critical factor in the heat exchange process. The reduction of urban ventilation will aggravate the heat effect of surface runoff. Compared with the underlying permeable surface, the impervious surface is the main driving force for the formation of surface thermal runoff pollution.					; Peng, Shuangyun/GQQ-7841-2022	Luo, Yi/0000-0002-6256-4595; Yang, Kun/0009-0002-6845-6381; Zhang, Yang/0000-0001-6402-160X													0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2023	59	4							e2022WR033881	10.1029/2022WR033881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033881													WOS:000975423800001

Two isolates were environmental isolates from waters in Serbia whereas the third one was DSM 498. Antibacterial activity was studied in different water media-nutrient-rich media (peptone water), water from Sava Lake, and commercially available spring water. The Ag-containing zeolites showed bactericidal activity in the nutrient-rich peptone water after 1 h of contact. Cu- and Zn-containing zeolites showed bactericidal activity in real water samples. Antibacterial activity of the M-Z decreases in all three examined water media in the following order: Ag-NZ ae Ag-A > Cu-NZ ae Cu-A > Zn-NZ >>> Zn-A, suggesting that mainly the metal type and not the zeolite type have a role in the antibacterial activity. Leaching experiments showed small amounts of the leached Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, indicating that the antibacterial activity is not due to the metal ions but should be attributed to the M-Z itself. However, leached amounts of Ag(I) from Ag-NZ and Ag-A in peptone water indicate that the released Ag(I) could be mainly responsible for the bactericidal effect of the Ag(I)-containing zeolites. Since no loss of cellular material was found, the antibacterial activity is not attributed to cytoplasmic membrane damage.

Inconsistent records of regional environmental evolution affect accurate assessment of lake ecosystems. Chironomid larvae are one of the most abundant benthic invertebrates in lakes. The taxa composition of their functional groups is largely determined by aquatic habitats. Therefore, analyzing the changes of their functional traits can effectively indicate the hydrological dynamics in the past. In this study, we analyzed the early-middle Holocene (9.0-4.5 cal kyr BP) subfossil chironomid assemblages of a sedimentary sequence from the Darhad Basin in northern Mongolia. At 9.0 cal kyr BP, the community structure suddenly changed from littoral taxa to sublittoral/profundal taxa, reflecting an environmental transition from a river or shallow lake condition to a deep lake environment, which lasted until 4.5 cal kyr BP. Those hydrological patterns are consistent with the humidity evolution in the Westerlies dominated region, except that the onset of wetness occurred one thousand years earlier when comparing our results with previous ones, which may be related to the melting of regional glaciers and permafrost caused by increased summer solar insolation. Under the influence of various circulation systems, the Holocene humidity conditions on the Mongolian Plateau are spatially heterogeneous and the underlying mechanism is still ambiguous. The complexity of climate change may affect the accuracy of assessing lake ecosystem evolution. In this study, based on the precise chronology, a chironomid assemblage sequence from the Darhad Basin in northern Mongolia is analyzed to elucidate the hydroclimate variation during the early-middle Holocene. The results show that the chironomid communities changed suddenly from littoral taxa to sublittoral/profundal taxa at about 9 cal kyr BP, reflecting an environmental transition from a river or shallow lake condition to a deep lake environment. Thereafter, most parts of the paleolake remained at a relatively high level until 4.5 cal kyr BP. This hydrological pattern resembles the typical humidity variations in the Westerlies affected regions, except that the onset of wetter conditions occurred one thousand years earlier as reflected in our results. The melting of glaciers and permafrost in the basin resulting from the early increased summer solar insolation could be a feasible explanation for these time advances.

On the predictability of lake surface temperature using air temperature in a changing climate: A case study for Lake Tahoe (USA)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Can we predict long-term trends of lake surface temperature based on air temperature alone? We explore this question by analyzing the performance of a hybrid model (air2water) as a predictive tool for defining scenarios of lake surface temperature in the framework of climate change studies. Employing Lake Tahoe (U.S.A.) as a case study, we apply the model using different air temperature datasets (in situ measurements, gridded observations, and downscaled General Circulation Models). Through a data-driven calibration of the model parameters based on surface water temperature records, we show that air2water provides good performance (root mean square error similar to 0.5 degrees C, on a monthly scale) regardless of the input dataset. The model is able to accurately capture the historical long-term trend and interannual fluctuations over decades (from 1969 to present), using only 7 yr of monthly measurements of surface water temperature for calibration. Additionally, when used to predict future surface water temperature of the lake, air2water produces the same projections irrespective of the air temperature dataset used to drive the model. This is certainly desirable, but not immediately expected when using a relatively simple model. Overall, the results suggest the high potential and robustness of air2water as a predictive tool for climate change assessment. Lake surface temperature warming of up to 1.1 degrees C (RCP 4.5) and 2.9 degrees C (RCP 8.5) was simulated at the end of the 21st century during summer months in Lake Tahoe. Such a scenario, if realized, would lead to serious consequences on lake water chemistry, primary productivity, plankton community structure, and nutrient cycling.					; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/AAJ-7627-2021; Toffolon, Marco/D-4845-2011; Hook, Simon/D-5920-2016	Lenters, John/0000-0002-6895-7592; Piccolroaz, Sebastiano/0000-0003-1796-7624; Hook, Simon/0000-0002-0953-6165													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2018	63	1					243	261		10.1002/lno.10626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10626													WOS:000423029300015

Hypolimnetic temperatures vary between years but increased consistently in all lakes by about 0.1 - 0.2 degrees C per decade. The observed increase was related to the weather generated by large-scale climatic processes over the Atlantic. To be effective, the climatic signal from the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) must affect deep lakes in spring before the onset of thermal stratification. The most consistent predictor of hypolimnetic temperature is the mean NAO index for January-May (NAO(J-M)), which explains 22-63% of the interannual variation in deepwater temperature in 10 of the 12 lakes. The two exceptions are remote, less wind-exposed alpine valley lakes. In four of the deepest lakes, the climate signal fades with depth. The projected hypolimnetic temperature increase of approximately 1 degrees C in 100 yr, obtained using a conservative approach, seems small. Effects on mixing conditions, thermal stability, or the replenishment of oxygen to deep waters result in accumulation of nutrients, which in turn will affect the trophic status and the food web.					; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021	Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2006	51	6					2787	2793		10.4319/lo.2006.51.6.2787	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.6.2787													WOS:000242265700024
J	Solomon, KR				Solomon, KR			Endocrine-modulating substances in the environment: The wildlife connection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY												Historical observations, first publicized in Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, demonstrated biological effects of persistent, bioaccumulative pollutants on wildlife. These effects included disruption of reproduction and, in some situations, responses mediated through the endocrine system. The substances that caused these effects were mainly highly chlorinated halocarbon compounds, such as DDT (and metabolites), other organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. In contrast, responses of fish to industrial discharges and pulp mill effluents have implicated more water-soluble compounds. Characterizations of wildlife exposures require consideration of temporal and spatial factors that they exacerbate or ameliorate responses. Likewise, effects of endocrine-modulating substances may appear at subsequent stages of development, not at the time of exposure. Consistent with the declines in environmental concentrations of persistent, bioaccumulative substances, populations of several wild bird species, including bald eagles, cormorants, herring gulls, and Caspian terns, have increased, recovering from declines noted in previously polluted areas during the 1960s and 1970s.					; Solomon, Keith/AAF-4510-2020	Solomon, Keith R/0000-0002-8496-6413; 													1091-5818					MAR-APR	1998	17	2					159	171		10.1080/109158198226684	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/109158198226684													WOS:000072925100005

We examined the effects of nutrients, turbulent mixing, mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard and sediments on algal composition, algal biomass and autotrophic picoplankton (APP) abundance in a 6-week experiment of factorial design in twenty-four 5-m(3) outdoor mesocosms during late autumn 1995. 2. Turbulent mixing decreased surface temperature and increased turbidity, which also was increased by the addition of sediments. Total algal biomass was significantly enhanced by nutrients and mixing, and decreased by the sediment treatment. Ln the mixing x nutrient treatment, algal biomass increased more than expected from the individual effects, while the fish x mixing and mixing x sediment treatments increased algal biomass less than expected. 3. Cryptomonas (cryptomonad) blooms were observed in the unmixed, high nutrient treatment; Synedra (diatom) blooms were observed in the high nutrient, high sediment treatment; Ulothrix (green algae) blooms were observed in the mixed, high nutrient, low sediment treatment. 4. Eukaryotic APP abundances were increased by sediment addition and by turbulent mixing, and increased synergistically by mixing x sediment and mixing x nutrient interactions. Prokaryotic APP abundances were decreased by nutrient enhancement and by a mixing x nutrient interaction. There were no main effects of fish on APP abundance, but fish were involved in some of the two-way interactions. 5. The large number of significant interaction effects indicates that APP and other phytoplankton are regulated by a complex set of interdependent factors which should be considered simultaneously in studies of phytoplankton population dynamics and community composition.																			0046-5070					AUG	1999	42	1					99	109		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00464.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00464.x													WOS:000081929500009

ERA-Interim satellite reanalysis data of wind intensity and direction were used as inputs to force the hydrodynamic model. For SWAN calibration and validation in the study region, wave parameters were used. These parameters were acquired in situ by a directional waverider buoy. Statistical data showed the good performance of the model, albeit with a tendency to overestimate significant wave height and underestimate peak period and propagation direction. Once validated, wave parameters for five points at different depths were obtained during the four seasons of the year between 2017 and 2018. In general, it was observed that the largest ripples come from the S and SSW directions and occurred during spring at the deepest point under wind conditions exceeding 10 m s Ripples up to 0.30 m account for 77.9 % at the shallowest point and 65.7 % at the deepest point. Thus, the study area was classified as low energy and characterized by small, high-frequency, short-period ripples strongly influenced and determined by the local depth because larger ripples are always observed in the deepest locations, giving the lagoon a characteristic of depth-limited ripples. The results obtained here have the potential to contribute to territorial management of the region, with emphasis on the Integral Protection Conservation Unit located in the study area (ltapua State Park) and on the development and safety of the important, heavily used navigation route that connects Rio Grande Port to the state capital, Porto Alegre.

Two different sites in Romania were chosen for measurement campaigns: Surlari (44 degrees 34', 26 degrees 19') located into a forest and near a lake, and a suburban area, Magurele (44 degrees 21', 26 degrees 2'), where the anthropogenic activities dominate. The same equipments for measurements of surface ozone, CO, NO2, NO and PM10 were used at the two sites. The measurements were performed in the summer of 2012, for 14 days. The intercomparison between the data sets of the pollutant's concentrations has shown large differences for the two sites, especially in the case of surface ozone. The local conditions have an influence on air quality mostly due to natural sources of ozone and nitrogen oxides. The proximity of the lake and forest influence the surface ozone concentration at Surlari, while traffic and human activities influence SO2 concentrations, at Magurele. The maximum mass concentration values are similar at the two stations, but dispersion of values is larger at Magurele. During the campaigns period, the concentration values of gaseous pollutants and particulate matter were within the optimal range, according to national air quality reglementations.					; Radu, Cristian/R-5268-2018; Belegante, Livio/B-5812-2012; Stefan, Sabina/C-8814-2015	Stefan, Sabina/0000-0002-1948-8566; Belegante, Livio/0000-0002-4027-5995													1582-9596					FEB	2013	12	2					371	379		10.30638/eemj.2013.046	http://dx.doi.org/10.30638/eemj.2013.046													WOS:000317854400025

However, a lack of securely dated sites, especially from the western coastal plains of the CFR, has posed a challenge for understanding faunal communities and their connection to Pleistocene climate dynamics. Here, we present the systematic paleontology and paleoecological analysis of the large mammals from Besaansklip, a well-dated late glacial hyena den (similar to 16,000 years ago) from the west coast of the CFR. We identified >400 mammalian specimens from Besaansklip, which we use to infer past climate and terrestrial environments. Like other Pleistocene fossil assemblages in the region, Besaansklip has a high abundance and diversity of water-dependent grazers, many of which are extinct (e.g., Equus capensis and Syncerus antiquus) or extirpated (e.g., Connochaetes gnou). Stable carbon isotope analysis of ostrich eggshells from Besaansklip suggests a lack of C-4 grasses, implying a cool growing season and dominance of winter rainfall. These findings reinforce previous models suggesting that glacial phases of the Pleistocene were associated with increased moisture availability and productivity, and perhaps an expansion of grassy vegetation in the southwestern Cape.

J	Hernández-León, S				Hernandez-Leon, Santiago			Top-down effects and carbon flux in the ocean: A hypothesis	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The close relationships between mesozooplankton, chlorophyll, and primary production normally observed across latitudes may be regarded as a bottom-up effect of increased productivity or, conversely, as a top-down effect of mesozooplankton on microzooplankton, releasing phytoplankton growth. The time-course of primary producers and mesozooplankton observed during the Late Winter Bloom in subtropical waters suggests a top-down effect, similar to the results found in lakes and mesocosm experiments. Two scenarios were observed during the development of the bloom in the Canary Island waters. The first was the increase in mesozooplankton as the effect of higher primary production due to mixing. The second scenario was the decrease in mesozooplankton due to the top-down effect of predation by diel vertical migrants upon epipelagic mesozooplankton. The structure of the food web in the euphotic zone was different depending on the presence or not of mesozooplankton, suggesting important consequences for the transport of carbon in those large areas of the ocean.

Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of current and future GLOF hazard for Gepang Gath Lake, Western Himalaya, considering rock and/or ice avalanches cascading into the lake. We consider ground surface temperature and topography to define avalanche source zones located in areas of potentially degrading permafrost. GLOF process chains in current and future scenarios, also considering engineered lake lowering of 10 and 30 m, were evaluated. Here, varied avalanche impact waves, erosion patterns, debris flow hydraulics, and GLOF impacts at Sissu village, under 18 different scenarios were assessed. Authors demonstrated that a larger future lake does not necessarily produce larger GLOF events in Sissu, depending, among other factors, on the location from where the triggering avalanche initiates and strikes the lake. For the largest scenarios, 10 m of lowering reduces the high-intensity zone by 54% and 63% for the current and future scenarios, respectively, but has little effect on the medium-intensity flood zone. Even with 30 m of lake lowering, the Sissu helipad falls in the high-intensity zone under all moderate-to-large scenarios, with severe implications for evacuations and other emergency response actions. The approach can be extended to other glacial lakes to demonstrate the efficiency of lake lowering as an option for GLOF mitigation and enable a robust GLOF hazard and risk assessment.

The extracted effect of environmental selection and spatial processes may vary if different classification approaches are applied to phytoplankton and the spatial scales. In this study, summer phytoplankton of 43 lakes from three major lake regions in China were investigated and phytoplankton were classified with three approaches: taxonomy of species, habitat template-based functional groups, and morphology-based functional groups. Within a single lake region, the pattern of phytoplankton meta-community was significantly explained by environmental but not by spatial variables. In a larger scale covering all the three lake regions, both environmental and spatial variables explained the variance of the phytoplankton community, but the spatial variables were detected only by classification with species, and only the environmental variables were detected with phytoplankton functional groups. This study revealed that although vegetative populations of different species sorted into the same functional group have common response to environmental changes, their dispersal abilities, mechanisms, and strategies might differ markedly and therefore the species-specific approach cannot be disregarded when studying phytoplankton patterns at spatial scales.

J	Lamborg, CH; Fitzgerald, WF; Skoog, A; Visscher, PT				Lamborg, CH; Fitzgerald, WF; Skoog, A; Visscher, PT			The abundance and source of mercury-binding organic ligands in Long Island Sound	MARINE CHEMISTRY												The abundance and strength of mercury (Hg)-complexing organic matter was measured in samples collected from Long Island Sound (LIS) and related locations. A range in ligand-equivalent concentrations was found in LIS (0.3-6 nN). Rivers, lakes, sewage effluent, and marine porewaters were also sampled. When the ligand concentrations were normalized to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, the samples fell into broad groups. Offshore and sewage effluent samples were relatively ligand-poor, while river, lake, and porewater samples were ligand-rich. Normalized ligand abundance in LIS water was intermediate. A first-order mass balance for ligand and DOC suggests that terrestrial organic matter and phytoplankton exudates are the dominant sources of ligand to LIS, while tidal exchange and an unknown term are the dominant sinks. Concentration distributions through the Connecticut River (CTR) estuary suggest pseudo-conservative mixing of the ligand derived from the Connecticut River watershed. The identity of the material is unknown, but ligand-to-DOC ratios are well below the ratio of bulk reduced sulfur to DOC. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This hampers our capacity to predict the occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom accurately. Here, we studied the relationship between temperature, N and P cycles, and the microbial community abundance and diversity at 0.5 m under the surface of West Lake (China) from January 21 to November 20, 2015, in order to better understand the key factors regulating temporal changes in the cyanobacterial community. Using high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region, we studied the diversity and abundance of bacteria. In parallel, we measured physico-chemical parameters and followed the abundance of key genes involved in N fixation, denitrification, and nutrient uptake. Multivariate analyses suggest that P concentration and water temperature are the key factors controlling the outbreak of summer cyanobacterial bloom. RT-qPCR analyses of the bacterial community and measurements of the copy number of denitrification-related gene (nirK, nosZ, nirS) show that denitrification potential and denitrifying bacteria relative abundance (Pseudomonas and Bacillus) increased in concert with diazotrophic cyanobacterial genera (Anabaena, Nostoc, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) and the common bloom-forming non-diazotrophic cyanobacterium genus Microcystis. The present study brings new insights on the complex interplay between physico-chemical parameters, heterotrophic bacterial community composition, nitrogen cycle, and cyanobacteria dominance in a eutrophic lake.

These analyses were conducted to trace the provenance of the sediments. Textural parameters reveal that the lake sediments consist predominantly clay and silt fractions. The C/N ratio of the sediments indicates a mixed source of TOC, both autochthonous and allochthonous in origin. The log (Fe2O3/K2O) Vs. log (SiO2/Al2O3) graph of the sediments discriminates the rock types of the catchment area that are Fe-shale, Fe-sand, wacke, shale and litharenite. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) falls between 59.11 to 90.16% and Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW) between 63.97 to 99.68% and these values are higher than the Post-Archaean Australian Shale (PAAS), indicating moderate to highly chemically weathered lake floor sediments. Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values (60.74-99.63%) suggests the occurrence of plagioclase feldspars in the lake floor sediments. Geochemical characteristics signify a mixed-nature of provenance of the lake floor sediments due to the tectonic settings of the lake basin in a complex catchment area.					; Lone, Aasif/AAA-2772-2021; Achyuthan, Hema/AAA-6898-2022	LONE, AASIF/0000-0002-1517-2038; Achyuthan, Hema/0000-0001-5495-4115; 													0016-7622	0974-6889				MAY	2017	89	5					563	572		10.1007/s12594-017-0645-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12594-017-0645-4													WOS:000402076300010

C.; Behera, Mama Manjali; Mishra, Sameeksha			ENSO-induced groundwater changes in India derived from GRACE and GLDAS	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												This study aims to quantify the interannual variations of groundwater storage changes (GWSCs) over India. GWSCs are derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and global land data assimilation system (GLDAS)-Noah life safety model (LSM) for the period 2003-2015. Estimated GWSCs are validated with the satellite altimetry over the six lake stations. The variability of GWSC and altimetry water-level heights are assessed with the cross-correlation and plotting analysis. Annual trends of GWSC and GRACE in terrestrial water storage (TWS) were estimated using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope method. Results suggest that GWSC and TWS have declined in northern India at the rate of approximate to 1.6 cm yr-1 and in southern and western central India at the rate of approximate to 0.5 cm yr-1. Impacts of short-term climate perturbations such as El Nino and La Nina for the GWSCs are assessed. During the El Nino period, the decline of GWSC over northern India enhanced, whereas during the La Nina period, the recovery of GWSC is evident. These interannual variations of GWSCs over India are attributed by interannual precipitation changes. Under the global warming scenario, the occurrences of El Nino events are likely to enhance in the future, and our findings help the water resource management policy makers for necessary actions during such short-term climate perturbations.					; Vissa, Naresh/AAA-4676-2022	Anandh, P.C./0000-0001-6889-5603; Vissa, Naresh/0000-0003-0118-3075; , Dr. Sameeksha Mishra/0000-0001-5269-5658													2347-4327	0973-774X				JUL	2019	128	5							115	10.1007/s12040-019-1148-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-019-1148-z													WOS:000468344400007

In this study, monthly GRACE Level 2 Release 6 (RL06) products were employed to characterize TWS changes between April 2002 and August 2016 in the EQTP. Based on the observations and hydrological model output, the dominant factors contributing to the changes in TWS in sub-basins, and areas of TWS decrease and increase were analyzed systematically. We concluded that the TWS in the EQTP showed a slight decreasing trend from 2002 to 2016 with obvious spatial heterogeneity. The decrease in TWS may be attributed to the increase in evapotranspiration, which explains approximately 59% of the variations. In the region where a substantial decrease in TWS was observed, the trend primarily depended on evapotranspiration, and was certainly affected by glacial ablation. Moreover, the expansion of lakes supplemented by glaciers was the main cause of TWS change in the areas where TWS increased. A decrease in TWS mainly occurred in summer and was mainly due to the increase in evapotranspiration because of warming, an increase in wind speed, and a decrease in relative humidity.

From 1992 to 1995, we examined the infestation and impact of Dreissena on unionids at several sites near the Island of Montreal. Unionids suffered heavy (90-100%) mortality at sites where Dreissena occurred in high densities (i.e., 4000 - 20 000/m(2)). Mean infestations (<100 dreissenids/unionid) were 10-100 times lower than those reported for infested unionid populations in Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair, yet resulted in similarly high mortality levels. At two St. Lawrence River sites, significant declines in unionid density were first observed when mean infestations exceeded 10/unionid. North American data suggest that populations of unionids that carry, on average, a mass of Dreissena nearly equal to or greater than their own mass will become extirpated. We hypothesize that dreissenid infestation enhances unionid mortality primarily by interfering with normal activity (feeding, respiration, locomotion) in such a way as to cause the unionid to expend energy reserves required for surviving winter.					; Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010	Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054; 													0706-652X					JUN	1996	53	6					1434	1444		10.1139/cjfas-53-6-1434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-6-1434													WOS:A1996VP79900021

This paper seeks to identify the determinants and processes controlling the water chemistry of headwater alcoves at Zarnowo. The analysis is based on periodic hydrochemical mapping carried out over the years 2012-2013 in the Drawsko Lakeland. The hydrochemical measurements performed so far show that the water found in the alcoves has specific conductivity ranging from 320 to 512 mu S cm(-1), and that the samples examined display a mosaic pattern of spatial and temporal differences in their levels of biogenic components and heavy metals. In turn, ions featuring in the mineralogical-petrographic composition of deposits in zero-discharge catchments, like Ca2+, HCO3-, Mg2+ and Na+, show low temporal variability and small differences within the headwater alcoves. The application of factor analysis allowed the identification of chief determinants responsible for the chemical composition of water in the Zarnowo channel head. The factors include: a geogenic one; a man-made one of local significance; an atmospheric one reflecting the regional impact of the wet deposition; a biogenic one; and the redox potential representing changes that occur in the hyporheic zone. The transformation of the chemical composition of water in the hyporheic zone of the headwater alcoves under study can be an effect of: 1. the outflowing groundwater attaining a physico-chemical equilibrium in response to current atmospheric conditions, 2. precipitation, ion-exchange sorption, oxidation and reduction of some chemical components (e.g. Fe2+/3+, Mn2+, NO3-, PO43-, SO42-), and 3. retention of nutrients (including K+, Ca2+, NO3-, PO43-, SO42-) by communities of water- and moisture-loving plants in the growing season (biological sorption) and their release in the autumn. It should be emphasised that in the eutrophic environment of a channel head the seasonality of concentrations of biogenic components in water is less distinct. Hydrochemical studies carried out in the ground- and surface-water contact zone within a channel head help to understand the processes that take place in headwater valleys and to explain their causes, which in turn will allow protecting water resources better against unfavourable changes occurring in their quality.

The submerged species dominating in the rudd diets were Potamogeton obtusifolius, Ranunculus circinatus, Sparganitan emersum, bryophytes, and filamentous algae. Plant consumption estimated with bioenergetics modelling increased with fish age, being highest in late summer concomitant with the macrophyte biomass peak. Depending on the age structure, a rudd biomass of 20 kg ha(-1) consumes 18-23 kg of macrophytes ha(-1) a(-1), while a rudd biomass of 100 kg ha(-1) results in plant consumption of 92-115 kg ha(-1) a(-1). Although, rudd seemed to feed rather unselectively on suitable-sized and edible plants, some species abundant in the littoral, such as Myriophyllum verticillatum and pleustophytic Ceratophyllum demersum, were not found in rudd guts, indicating selective plant consumption. In Kirkkojarvi, selective grazing by rudd and increased turbidity and high nutrient levels partly caused by bottom dwelling cyprinid fish, may promote the inedible and pleustophytic macrophytes, which have increased in Kirkkojarvi during the past decades.

Modelling the Effects of Groundwater Lags on Nitrate Inputs to Lakes Rotorua & Taupo, New Zealand	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA					A conceptual rainfall-runoff model has been adapted for predicting nitrate concentrations in streams draining the volcanic plateau, central North Island, New Zealand. The model is similar to HBV-N (Pettersson et al. 2001) and the nitrate model of Tamura et al. (1999). It has been developed in response to increasing trends in stream nitrate concentration observed recently in streams draining to both Lake Rotorua and Lake Taupo - iconic water bodies important for recreation and tourism. In these catchments land-use has changed from native bush in the 1930s to low intensity grazing in the 1950-1970s and more intensive grazing (including some dairying) in the 1990s. Riparian fencing was implemented in both regions during the 1970-1980s and while this has reduced particulate loads in the streams, it has done nothing to halt the increasing trend in nitrate concentration. Many of the catchments in the volcanic plateau are underlain by thick layers of fractured ignimbrite and the streams have a high proportion of baseflow supplied by deep groundwater. The water in some of the streams has been aged using tritium (and more recently CFC and SF6) and found to have mean residence times of 30-80 years. There is concern that nitrate liberated when land was first developed 35-45 years ago is still making its way through the groundwater towards the lakes. It is intended to use the model to address management questions such as: where in the catchment is it possible to intercept nitrate (e. g., in riparian buffer strips and wetlands); where is it necessary to reduce nitrate fluxes leaving the root zone (e. g., by retiring pasture); and how long will it take before the benefits of remediation become apparent. The model simulates rainfall, infiltration, evapotranspiration and percolation in the root-zone. Surface runoff is simulated by Hortonian inflitration excess runoff during heavy rain and direct runoff of rain falling on saturated soils near the stream, although the pumice soils of the central volcanic plateau are generally free-draining. Streamflow is driven by the outflow from 3 conceptual reservoirs that represent quick shallow sub-surface flow (time scale 1-2 days), slow subsurface flow (2-10 days), and groundwater (weeks-years). To date the rainfall-runoff model has been calibrated in the Waiteti Stream, Rotorua, and the Tutaeaua Stream, Taupo, where it replicates the observed spring-fed baseflow which is a feature of the study streams. It is currently being calibrated and tested in the 8 major catchments of Lake Rotorua. The nitrate model is still being perfected. Currently our knowledge of how leachate concentration increased during the 1930-1970s is incomplete and two different models have been trialled. In Model 1 the nitrate concentration in water leaching from the root-zone is specified. Model 1 successfully simulates an increase in baseflow nitrate driven by slowly increasing groundwater nitrate concentration - which mimics long-term trends in stream nitrate. However, Model 1 predicts a positive correlation between stream nitrate concentration and flow whereas Hoare (1980) observed a negative correlation during floods. In Model 2 nitrate is generated (by mixing and/or mineralization) in the conceptual reservoirs as suggested by Tamura et al. (1999). Model 2 successfully simulates the observed negative correlation between stream nitrate and flow. Further work is underway to refine the nitrate component of the model. Agricultural statistics are being combined with recent leaching studies under different intensities of land-use in an attempt to reconstruct past trends in leachate concentration.																					978-0-9758400-2-3				2005							2749	2754																WOS:000290114102114
J	Nagasaka, M				Nagasaka, M			Changes in biomass and spatial distribution of Elodea nuttallii (Planch.) St. John, an invasive submerged plant, in oligomesotrophic Lake Kizaki from 1999 to 2002	LIMNOLOGY												Distribution of pure Elodea nuttallii vegetation was surveyed from 1999 to 2002, immediately after the most recent expansion of the species in Lake Kizaki, Japan. During 2001 and 2002, areas of E. nuttallii vegetation rapidly diminished and the summer plant height decreased wherever the vegetation remained. The organic matter content, total phosphorus, and extracted P of the sediment from the vegetation bed were measured. A linear relationship was observed between the extracted P in the sediment and the biomass. The extracted P significantly decreased in the shallow littoral vegetation bed, where the biomass clearly diminished. A fertilization experiment using the shallow littoral sediment collected in the vegetation bed was conducted in 2001. In this experiment, apical shoots of E. nuttallii were planted in pots with fertilized sediment (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium additions). The growth of E. nuttallii shoots was significantly enhanced by enrichment with phosphorus alone. The ecological implication of sediment phosphorus limitation is discussed in relation to the cause of decline in the E. nuttallii population in Lake Kizaki.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2004	5	3					129	139		10.1007/s10201-004-0129-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-004-0129-2													WOS:000225778000001

Epitheliocystis in lake trout Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum) is associated with a β-proteobacteria	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Lake trout Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum) raised for stocking experienced yearly (2011-13) winter epizootics of epitheliocystis. Affected fish were dispersed on the bottom of the tank, had decreased feed and fright response, and mortality often reached 40%. Peak mortality occurred within 3weeks of the appearance of clinical signs, and outbreaks typically lasted 6weeks. Affected fish had no gross lesions but histologically had branchial epithelial necrosis and lamellar hyperplasia, with small to large numbers of scattered epithelial cells containing 10- to 20-m inclusions. A longitudinal study was undertaken of one annual outbreak, and lamellar hyperplasia was most closely associated with mortality. The number of inclusions was statistically greater (P<0.05) before and during peak mortality, but inclusions were present in low numbers before clinical signs occurred. Results of histochemical staining, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy supported the presence of a -proteobacteria rather than a Chlamydiales bacterium within inclusions. PCR primers to identify Chlamydiales did not give consistent results. However, the use of universal 16S rDNA bacterial primers in conjunction with laser capture microdissection of inclusions demonstrated that a -proteobacteria was consistently associated with affected gills and is more likely the cause of the disease in lake trout.

It is relatively well-known how the different factors work separately, but how they work together, especially near water bodies, is still unclear. This paper investigates the effects of blue bodies (rivers or large lakes), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), building coverage (BC), and building height (BH) on the land surface temperature (LST), comparing the situation around lakes and a river. Their inter-relationships are explored in a square grid of 30 x 30 m using Landsat-8 data on LST measurements in Prague, Czech Republic, in summer 2022. Multiple regression models are used for the analysis. The results imply that the NDVI significantly reduces LSTs, followed rivers if within 200 m of one, while the effect of lakes is negligible. The effect of BH is low. BC is a predominant factor in the city, generating a warming effect, which increases with the city's compactness. The main planning implications are to base urban heat island mitigation strategies on compensating for building coverage with live and dense green bodies, promoting vertical development.					; Moravec, David/ABI-1248-2020; Komarek, Jan/N-4898-2018; Kirschner, Vladka/ACJ-3021-2022; Kozhoridze, Giorgi/HTQ-2659-2023; Macků, Karel/ABG-7364-2020	Komarek, Jan/0000-0002-3505-6755; Macku, Karel/0000-0002-5899-2626; Kozhoridze, Giorgi/0000-0003-2327-0778; Moravec, David/0000-0003-4348-2815; 														2073-445X				FEB	2024	13	2							162	10.3390/land13020162	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land13020162													WOS:001170179900001

In addition, the collected material can be used in many industries such as energy, medicine, cosmetics or catering. The problem of cleaning the shoreline area concerns the need to clear land, water and the strip of shore and land onto which water is thrown from falling waves. The vast majority of available cleaning methods are adapted to cleaning beaches or waters. There is a lack of solutions and machine designs suitable for cleaning the coastal strip, which includes: land, the area of land on which the wave is thrown, shoal and deep water. This area is particularly important for tourism as it is mainly used for water bathing. Pictures from tourist areas that are exposed to intensive water contamination show that measures taken to clear the shoreline area are not very effective, as seaweed in shallow water is thrown ashore with the waves. The paper presents a review of methods for cleaning coastal waters and beaches from contamination. It also shows the author's conceptual design adapted to clear the shoreline area and sandy beaches.

The surface values are about 2 parts per thousand more negative than the values to be expected assuming equilibrium with the atmospheric CO2 reservoir. In the hypolimnion of Lake Erie, the values become more negative as the summer progresses due to the increasing amounts of CO2 from decaying organic matter. Although Lakes Erie and Ontario receive considerably larger amounts of organic C as domestic and industrial sewage effluents than the upper Great Lakes, their higher inorganic C concentrations evidently mask any isotopic effects from the decay of the organic pollutants. Models to explain the variation in the .delta.13C in the hypolimnion and epilimnion of a lake are presented. The agreement between predicted and observed .delta.13C trends for the hypolimnion model is reasonable, suggesting that the flux rates assumed in the model are reasonable for the processes occurring in the lakes.																									1978	35	4					422	436		10.1139/f78-074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-074													WOS:A1978ET15200007
J	Cosgun, AE; Demir, H				Cosgun, Atil Emre; Demir, Hasan			Investigating the Effect of Albedo in Simulation-Based Floating Photovoltaic System: 1 MW Bifacial Floating Photovoltaic System Design	ENERGIES												Photovoltaic (PV) modules have emerged as a promising technology in the realm of sustainable energy solutions, specifically in the harnessing of solar energy. Photovoltaic modules, which use solar energy to generate electricity, are often used on terrestrial platforms. In recent years, there has been an increasing inclination towards the installation of photovoltaic (PV) modules over water surfaces, including lakes, reservoirs, and even oceans. The novel methodology introduces distinct benefits and complexities, specifically pertaining to the thermal characteristics of the modules. In order to accomplish this objective, a photovoltaic (PV) module system with a capacity of 1 MW was developed as a scenario in the PVsyst Program. The scenario simulation was conducted on the Mamasin Dam, situated in the Gokce village within the Aksaray province. To conduct the efficiency analysis, a comparative evaluation was conducted between bifacial and monofacial modules, which were installed from above the water at 1 m. The comparison was made considering two different types of modules. Additionally, the albedo effect, water saving amount, and CO2 emissions of the system were also investigated. Albedo measurements were made in summer when the PV power plant will operate most efficiently. As a result of the simulations, it was found that bifacial modules produce 12.4% more energy annually than monofacial modules due to the albedo effect. It is estimated that PV power plant installation will save 19,562.695 and 17,253.475 tons of CO2 emissions in bifacial and monofacial systems, respectively.					demir, hasan/AAA-8540-2022; Demir, Hasan/AAA-8540-2022; COSGUN, ATIL/ACO-7080-2022	Demir, Hasan/0000-0001-5424-7242; COSGUN, ATIL EMRE/0000-0002-4889-300X														1996-1073				FEB	2024	17	4							959	10.3390/en17040959	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en17040959													WOS:001175185300001

In this paper we report on findings from the Peruvian Amazon based on the first large-scale community survey that uses local ecological knowledge to assess the presence of indicator species and expected harvest yields of game, fish and timber along four major rivers. Our findings from nearly 700 communities suggest that the forest and lakes near riverine communities have been impoverished over the past 50 years, especially of vulnerable species of high commercial value. A zone of species depletion is detected around the two major regional cities of Iquitos and Pucallpa as well as around an important oil town. Local extirpations are common though some recovery is noted for specific fish and timber species. Expected yields are falling and evidence is found for harvesting of previously non-preferred species. Newer communities face lower initial availability of wild resources and forest impoverishment is driven by market demand over subsistence needs. Our findings illustrate the value of drawing on local ecological knowledge and the importance of considering historical baseline conditions in assessments of the fate of wild resources in tropical forests.

West African monsoon dynamics inferred from abrupt fluctuations of Lake Mega-Chad	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												From the deglacial period to the mid-Holocene, North Africa was characterized by much wetter conditions than today. The broad timing of this period, termed the African Humid Period, is well known. However, the rapidity of the onset and termination of the African Humid Period are contested, with strong evidence for both abrupt and gradual change. We use optically stimulated luminescence dating of dunes, shorelines, and fluviolacustrine deposits to reconstruct the fluctuations of Lake Mega-Chad, which was the largest pluvial lake in Africa. Humid conditions first occur at similar to 15 ka, and by 11.5 ka, Lake Mega-Chad had reached a highstand, which persisted until 5.0 ka. Lake levels fell rapidly at similar to 5 ka, indicating abrupt aridification across the entire Lake Mega-Chad Basin. This record provides strong terrestrial evidence that the African Humid Period ended abruptly, supporting the hypothesis that the African monsoon responds to insolation forcing in a markedly nonlinear manner. In addition, Lake Mega-Chad exerts strong control on global biogeochemical cycles because the northern (Bodele) basin is currently the world's greatest single dust source and possibly an important source of limiting nutrients for both the Amazon Basin and equatorial Atlantic. However, we demonstrate that the final desiccation of the Bodele Basin occurred around 1 ka. Consequently, the present-day mode and scale of dust production from the Bodele Basin cannot have occurred before 1 ka, suggesting that its role in fertilizing marine and terrestrial ecosystems is either overstated or geologically recent.

The new bathymetric map indicates that the floor of the lake is much smoother than previously considered. The minimum bottom elevation is 256 m below mean sea level, 3 m below that reported previously. The floor in the deepest part is more disturbed than elsewhere in the lake.The bathymetry provides evidence for active faulting, mostly along the margins. Two active faults extend away from the margin into the interior of the lake. These faults are probably extensions of faults recognized on land. Comparisons with other geophysical data sets, including gravity, magnetics, and seismic reflection and refraction profiles, indicate that some of the bathymetric features reflect deep structures. For example, several active faults which affect the bathymetry also affect the basement. An interesting observation is that hot and salty springs which flow into the lake are located along active and possibly shallow faults near points of interaction with deep-seated faults.																			0021-2164						1990	39	2-4					77	83																WOS:A1990JW67100005
J	Röhl, K				Roehl, Katrin			Thermo-erosional notch development at fresh-water-calving Tasman Glacier, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Controls on glacier calving rates are receiving increased scientific interest. At fresh-water-calving glaciers, limnological factors might be more important than glaciological ones. Measurements of thermo-erosional notch development at the calving ice cliff of Tasman Glacier, New Zealand, suggest that the calving rates at this glacier are directly controlled by the rate of thermal undercutting. Notch formation rates typically vary between 10 and 30 cm d(-1) (maximum rate 65 cm d(-1)) in summer, corresponding to an average calving rate of 34 m a(-1). Notch formation is slower than waterline melt and is controlled by water temperatures and circulation, cliff geometry, debris supply and water-level fluctuations. The latter shift the position of undercutting, resetting the level of the notch formation process and thereby slowing it. The geometry of the notch and the debris supply determine the extent of influence of the lake on notch water temperatures and circulation. Hence, water temperatures in the lake are not necessarily indicative of the rate of notch formation. The prediction of rate of notch formation from far-field variables is hampered by the complex interaction of the influencing factors. The significance of thermal undercutting as a calving rate-controlling process decreases with increasing ice velocities, calving rates and surface gradients.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					2006	52	177					203	213		10.3189/172756506781828773	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756506781828773													WOS:000240609000004

In this study, the linkages between the previous wintertime (December-January-February-March) NAM (WNAM) and springtime vegetation growth across North Eurasia (NEUA), as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were investigated. Results indicate vegetation cover tends be higher than normal over Europe (western Siberia) in March (May) during or after WNAM's positive phase, and the opposite for WNAM's negative phase. However, reduced April vegetation growth across central NEUA is apparent after both the positive and negative phases of the WNAM. In March, the WNAM anomaly excites a Rossby wave from the North Atlantic to western NEUA, generating anomalous high pressure and an anticyclone across western NEUA during WNAM's positive phase. Consequently, there is a notable increase in 2-m air temperature in the region, which favors vegetation growth. In April, a North Atlantic tripole pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies preserves the previous WNAM signal and triggers atmospheric wave trains from the North Atlantic to central NEUA after WNAM's positive phase. This in turn leads to anomalous low pressure and increased cloudiness in central NEUA, which results in a reduction in temperature and solar radiation, thereby inhibiting vegetation growth in the region. However, in April after WNAM's negative phase, positive snow cover anomalies reduce the turbulent heat flux to the south of Lake Baikal, altering the temperature gradient and triggering an anomalous cyclone, which also leads to reduced temperatures and solar radiation, thereby suppressing vegetation growth in central NEUA in April. WNAM's impact on vegetation in May mirrors the physical processes after its positive phase in April, particularly in connection with the North Atlantic tripole SST. The findings offer new insights into WNAM's impact on climate and vegetation in the northern mid-high latitudes, suggesting that WNAM could serve as a reliable predictor for spring vegetation growth anomalies in NEUA.

Lake Erhai (100 degrees 05-100 degrees 17'N and 25 degrees 36'-25 degrees 58'E) is a large and deep lake in Yunnan Province, located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau of Southwest China. Some deep lakes located in areas adjacent to Lake Erhai with similar climatic conditions and water depths are warm monomictic lakes. However, the historical data of the surface water temperature and bottom water temperature for the past 15 years (2004-2018) showed small differences (<1 degrees C). However, ours and some other studies on the vertical water temperature profile showed mixing of the entire water column in different seasons. We have applied a well-established hydrodynamics model (CE-QUAL-W2) to explore the main process that induces the particular thermal structure of Lake Erhai. Model calibration was conducted twice, once with the extinction coefficient (K-d) and fraction of solar radiation absorbed in the surface layer (BETA) as the main calibrated parameters, and the other considering the process of bottom-water heat exchange, represented by the sediment temperature (TSED) parameter in the CE-QUAL-W2 model. The simulation results showed that the model can reproduce water level and surface water temperature accurately with the first calibration (TSED is 14.8 degrees C), however, only when the TSED is greater than 24 degrees C, the RMSE can be less than 2 degrees C. The model reproduces the bottom water temperature well when the TSED value was 29.6 +/- 0.37 degrees C. Moreover, a series of scenarios were conducted to quantify the effect of wind speed and/or tributary inflows temperature on the thermal structure of Lake Erhai, and two stability indices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work) were calculated to quantify the energy required for stratification and mixing. These results demonstrated that the most likely process to establish the holomixis of Lake Erhai is geothermal heat transfer from sediment to water column, and an additional 12% heat flux from sediment plus the actual external energy supplies from sediment are required to mix the entire water column of Lake Erhai in summer.

Significant changes in groundwater levels were also inferred from river paleowetland deposits in northern Chile and the northern Bolivian Altiplano but the discrepancies which appeared in the data from paleolakes and paleowetlands are still not understood. In this paper we present stratigraphy and diatom analyses in new paleowetland records from non-glacial valleys. These data, compared with previous results, show that non-stormy precipitation (recorded by fine and/or organic sedimentation) dominated continuously from similar to 11200 to similar to 1500 cal yr BP and that convective rainfall (recorded by strong erosion) occurred only episodically in the northern Altiplano. Convective rainfall was similar to the type of precipitation which nowadays occurs during the rainy season (austral summer) when the tropical easterlies from the Atlantic reach the Bolivian Andes. Non-stormy precipitation is interpreted as a result of an intensification of cold-air incursions from southern polar regions, in good agreement with data from Brazil. The maximum intensity in cold-air incursions occurred during the Early Holocene and coincided with a climatic optimum in Antarctica and a considerably reduced El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During the Middle and Late Holocene, cold-air incursions decreased and the ENSO frequency increased. We suggest that the interactions between the southern high and low latitudes, by means of cold-air incursions and associated changes in the west wind flow, have been the main mechanisms involved in climatic changes at the latitudes of Bolivia.

Escherichia coli concentrations are commonly used to evaluate recreational and irrigation water quality. We hypothesized that there may exist temporally stable spatial patterns of E. coli concentrations across ponds, meaning that some areas mostly have higher and other areas mostly lower than average concentrations of E. coli. To test this hypothesis, we sampled two irrigation ponds in Maryland at nodes of spatial grids biweekly during the summer of 2016. Environmental covariates-temperature, turbidity, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, and nutrients-were measured in conjunction with E. coli concentrations. Temporal stability was assessed using mean relative differences between measurements in each location and averaged measurements across ponds. Temporally stable spatial patterns of E. coli concentrations and the majority of environmental covariates were expressed for both ponds. In the pond interior, larger relative mean differences in chlorophyll a corresponded to smaller mean relative differences in E. coli concentrations, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.819. Turbidity and ammonium concentrations were the two other environmental covariates with the largest positive correlations between their location ranks and the E. coli concentration location ranks. Tenfold differences were found between geometric mean E. coli concentrations in locations that were consistently high or consistently low. The existence of temporally stable patterns of E. coli concentrations can affect the results of microbial water quality assessment in ponds and should be accounted for in microbial water quality monitoring design. IMPORTANCE The microbial quality of water in irrigation water sources must be assessed to prevent the spread of microbes that can cause disease in humans because of produce consumption. The microbial quality of irrigation water is evaluated based on concentrations of Escherichia coli as the indicator organism. Given the high spatial and temporal variability of E. coli concentrations in irrigation water sources, recommendations are needed on where and when samples of water have to be taken for microbial analysis. This work demonstrates the presence of a temporally stable spatial pattern in the distributions of E. coli concentrations across irrigation ponds. The ponds studied had zones where E. coli concentrations were mostly higher than average and zones where the concentrations were mostly lower than average over the entire observation period, covering the season when water was used for irrigation. Accounting for the existence of such zones will improve the design and implementation of microbial water quality monitoring.

Comparison of ovarian atresia frequencies and adult sex ratios in nine white sucker populations indicated that this spawning disorder may have been due to a paucity of males at spawning. Adult female: male sex ratio in the King Lake population was 2.82:1 in 1981 and 2.73:1 in 1987, compared with 0.91:1 to 1.75:1 in populations that exhibited lower resorption frequencies (0-7.1%). Removal of 29% of the King Lake male suckers in 1988 elevated the female:male sex ratio to 3.5:1 and frequency of ovarian atresia rose to 75%. Unspawned ova were almost completely resorbed 3 months after the spring spawning period. Post-spawning mortality was not different between spent and resorbing females. The somatic condition of resorbing and spent females did not differ. There was no evidence that atresia interfered with gamete development subsequently. The sex ratio imbalance present in King Lake was not a function of population density.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				FEB	1990	36	2					231	239		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1990.tb05598.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1990.tb05598.x													WOS:A1990CR31700011
J	Gayaldo, PF; Nelson, K				Gayaldo, Perry F.; Nelson, Kitty			Preliminary results of light transmission under residential piers in Lake Washington, King County, Washington: A comparison between prisms and grating	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												During the summers of 2003 and 2004, 11 piers (two public and nine private) were evaluated for their ability to transmit light through the decking to the water surface below. Solid decking produces distinct shading that migrating juvenile Chinook salmon appear to avoid by swimming into deeper water where more potential predators live. Two new types of surface treatments (acrylic prisms and grating) were evaluated and compared to traditionally spaced decking as well as solid decking. Grating (with 37-58% open space) was found to transmit significantly more light to the water surface below (mean = 7.5% of full sunlight) than 23 x 5 cm acrylic prisms (mean = 0.7% of full sunlight). In other words, compared to full sunlight, grating transmits 10 times more light under the pier than acrylic prisms. In addition, light that passes through open grating penetrates the water evenly under the pier. Light transmitted through prisms concentrates beams of light that do not always reach the water surface.																			1040-2381					SEP	2006	22	3					245	249		10.1080/07438140609353902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140609353902													WOS:000243027700008

Based on a detailed seismic site survey, two sites at a water depth of up to 360 m were drilled in summer 2010, and cores were retrieved from sub-lake-floor depths of 140 m (Northern Basin) and 220 m (Ahlat Ridge). To obtain a complete sedimentary section, the two sites were multiple-cored in order to investigate the paleoclimate history of a sensitive semi-arid region between the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas. Further scientific goals of the PALEOVAN project are the reconstruction of earthquake activity, as well as the temporal, spatial, and compositional evolution of volcanism as reflected in the deposition of tephra layers. The sediments host organic matter from different sources and hence composition, which will be unravelled using biomarkers. Pathways for migration of continental and mantle-derived noble gases will be analyzed in pore waters. Preliminary 40Ar/39Ar single crystal dating of tephra layers and pollen analyses suggest that the Ahlat Ridge record encompasses more than half a million years of paleoclimate and volcanic/geodynamic history, providing the longest continental record in the entire Near East to date.

M. aeruginosa which blooms in fresh water lake and river at summer season with producing hazard toxin to animals. But it bears higher carbohydrates(56.4%) such as sucrose, cellobiose, rhamnose, galactose, xylose and glucose and also its generation time is shorter than B.braunii which is a good resource for bioenergy. And new medium for M. aeruginosa was developed with added urea 0.2g/L, increased Fe+2, and decreased Ca+2 ion compared with BG11 medium. After culture with 25L and 240 litter race-way reactor, M. aeruginosa was precipitated with combination of Al2SO4 and FeCl3, precipitates were hydrolyzed with c-H2SO4, followed autoclaved, sonication and neutralization, finally the extract was used for substrate of alcohol fermentation, 120mg/ml of sugar in BG11 medium, and 140 mg/ml in modified medium were produced. Fermentation was performed with 200 ml extract in 500ml flask at 30 degrees C for 30 hours, with 3 kinds of strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae(Sc), Pichia stipitis(Ps), Zymomonas mobilis(Zm), and mixed these strains(Sc+Ps+Zm). Pichia stipitis(0.7%) is more suitable for producing bioalcohol for M. aeruginosa extract than other strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(0.45%) and Zymomonas mobilis(0.61%), while co-cultured strains showed higest product by 1.75%. M. aeruginosa will be a novel resource for bioalcohol fermentation.						Yoon, Yang Ho/0000-0001-8529-9512													0197-7385		978-1-4577-2091-8				2012																								WOS:000309461400182
J	Schindler, DW				Schindler, DW			Aquatic problems caused by human activities in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada	AMBIO												Despite their protected status, aquatic ecosystems of Banff National Park have been subjected to a number of human stresses. Largely as the result of stocking programs earlier in the century, 10 species of nonnative fishes now occur in the Park, while one endemic subspecies of fish has been extirpated, and 2 other species are threatened. A number of rare invertebrates occur in hot springs and caves, including one mollusk that is endangered. Key invertebrates were extirpated from a number of fishless lakes by stocked fish, and in some cases have not returned, even though fishes did not survive. Restoration efforts in 2 small alpine lakes are described. Addition of nutrients and road salt have changed the chemical nature of the Bow River and its tributaries, and caused incidence of benthic algal mats to form in some sections. Impoundment and diversions affect over 40% of the Bow River catchment within the Park. Airborne organic contaminants concentrate in glaciers and high elevation snowpacks, yielding amounts high enough to contaminate fisheries to levels that in some cases approach guidelines for human consumption.

J	Daly, GL; Wania, F				Daly, GL; Wania, F			Simulating the influence of snow on the fate of organic compounds	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Snow scavenging, a seasonal snowpack, and a dynamic water balance are incorporated in a non-steady-state generic multimedia fate model in order to investigate the effect of snow on the magnitude and temporal variability of organic contaminant concentrations in various environmental media. Efficient scavenging of large nonpolar organic vapors and particle-bound organic chemicals by snow can lead to reduced wintertime air concentrations and incorporation in the snowpack. The snow cover functions as a temporary storage reservoir that releases contaminants accumulating over the winter during a short melt period, resulting in temporarily elevated concentrations in air, water, and soil. The intensity of these peaks increases with the length of the snow accumulation period. Organic chemicals of sufficient volatility (log K-OA < 9; e.g., light polychlorinated biphenyls) can volatilize from the snowpack, resulting in springtime concentration maxima in the atmosphere. The behavior of fairly water-soluble chemicals during snowmelt depends on their relative affinity for the newly formed liquid water phase and the rapidly diminishing ice surface-quantitatively expressed by their interface-water partition coefficient (K-IW). Chemicals with a preference for the dissolved phase (low K-IW; e.g., pentachlorophenol) can become enriched in the first meltwater fractions and experience a temporary concentration peak in lakes and rivers. Organic chemicals that are neither volatile enough to evaporate from the snowpack nor sufficiently water soluble to dissolve in the meltwater (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers) sorb to the particles in the snowpack. These particles may be sufficiently contaminated to constitute the major input route to the terrestrial environment upon release during snowmelt. Because wintertime deposition to the snowpack may be higher than to a non-snow covered surface, this can result in higher soil concentrations of persistent organic contaminants in the long term. The potential ecotoxicological significance of peak exposures demands a better understanding of the role of snow in the fate of organic contaminants.

Quantifying nitrate dynamics in an oligotrophic lake using Δ17O	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The stable isotopic compositions of nitrate, including the O-17 anomalies (Delta O-17), were determined twice in 1 yr (June and August 2007) in the oligotrophic water column of Lake Mashu, Japan. These data were then used to quantify the geochemical dynamics of nitrate in the lake, by using the deposition rate of the atmospheric nitrate onto the entire catchment area of the lake. The total amount of nitrate in the lake water decreased from 4.2 to 2.1 Mmol during the period between the observations, while the average Delta O-17 values remained uniform at + 2.5 parts per thousand. The Delta O-17 values corresponded to an small and uniform mixing ratio of atmospheric nitrate to total nitrate of 9.7 +/- 0.8%. These results indicate that 0.52 +/- 0.34 Mmol of the remineralized nitrate was fed into the water column through nitrification, while 2.6 +/- 0.4 Mmol of nitrate was simultaneously removed from the water column by assimilation, during the period between the observations. The lake water dissolved nitrate was characterized by rapid removal through assimilation during summer until it was almost completely removed from the euphotic layer, as well as continuous feeding into the lake through nitrification (3.2 +/- 0.3 Mmol a(-1)) and deposition (0.35 +/- 0.2 Mmol a(-1)), regardless of the seasons. The N-15-depleted nitrogen isotopic compositions of nitrate were as low as -6.5 parts per thousand in June, which also indicates that in-lake nitrification is the major source of nitrate in the lake and suggests that there is low potential for denitrification in and around the lake. Atmospheric nitrate deposited into the lake will be assimilated quickly, having a mean residence time of 1.2 +/- 0.1 yr. In addition, more than 90% of the assimilated nitrate will be remineralized to nitrate and re-assimilated via active nitrogen cycling in the lake.

Their position near the coast of the Ross Sea provides for a milder climate than much of the rest of the continent. Alpine and piedmont glaciers in the MDVs melt during the austral summer providing water to down gradient streams and terminal lakes on valley floors. There are currently 14 meteorological stations and 17 stream gauges operating across the MDVs, some with continuous records that go back to 1969. This relatively high density of monitoring stations reflects the fact that glaciers of different sizes and elevation ranges are the main source of water to streams. Thus, each glacier represents a different watershed. The bulk of these records start in the late 1980s/early 1990s. These data collection activities directly support research endeavours of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research project, as well as a host of other science groups working in the MDVs. As such, both real time data and archived data from these sites is available through the online database interface of the project (http://mcmlter.org).

However, this unique wetland has been suffered from serious habitat fragmentation and ecological function degradation due to increased socioeconomic activities within and surrounding the nature reserve. Aiming at enhancing its ecological function while balancing the needs between the conservation priorities and indispensable socioeconomic activities, three landuse scenarios of wetland restoration were proposed based on the different magnitude of wetland restoration. In this study, a physiotopes was used as planning unit which was defined as the combinations of landuse/landcover types and topographic factors (i.e. water level, slope) with RS & GIS techniques. The pros and cons of the scenarios were evaluated based on its ecological feasibility and practical applicability. The results provided the basis for adopting the measures of wetland restoration and consequent landuse adjustment, finally potential impacts and the practical suggestions for the wetland restoration and habitat modification in Hengshuilake NNR were thus forwarded and discussed.

J	Bubíková, K; Hrivnák, R				Bubikova, Katerina; Hrivnak, Richard			Artificial ponds in Central Europe do not fall behind the natural ponds in terms of macrophyte diversity	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												We studied macrophyte composition and 24 environmental variables in 69 ponds of both natural and artificial origin in Slovakia. We tested differences in alpha and gamma diversity and beta similarity between natural and artificial ponds for helophytes, hydrophytes, red list species and all species. We also assessed effects of environmental variables on species richness of studied ponds by generalised linear models (GLM). For local diversity, the significant difference was obtained only in case of helophytes. Beta similarity significantly differed for all the species groups. Total species numbers (gamma diversity) of all the groups were higher in natural ponds with the exception of hydrophytes. A randomization test of gamma diversity yielded significant differences for helophytes and all species groups; richness and diversity of hydrophytes and red list species were not significantly different. Thus, we can conclude that even though natural ponds have a significantly higher regional diversity, local diversity is comparable not only for common species but also endangered red-listed macrophytes and thus artificial ponds could serve as proper secondary habitats for macrophytes. GLM showed different effect of environmental predictors on richness of studied species and pond groups and a slightly higher explained variability in natural (40%) compared to artificial (37%) ponds.

For this purpose, we chose snow cover as an indicator for assessing pollution status in the study area. An assessment of the PCB accumulation level included in the list of POPs was carried out for a snow cover (SC) study in south-east Kazakhstan. The content of PCBs with a wide congener composition was determined using the chromatographic analysis method. During the winter periods of 2014, 2015, 2018-2020 and 2021, the SC pollution of the study area from up to 25 individual PCB congeners was identified. These congeners included highly toxic dioxin-like congener PCBs 105; 108; 114; 118 and "marker" PCBs 52; 101; 138; 153. These congeners were mainly found in snow samples with a wide range of PCB congener compositions. The main PCB pollution sources were indicated. The analysis of the obtained results and structure of the congener composition of PCBs show that the SC contamination in this territory occurs under the influence of local and regional sources.					; Madibekov, Azamat/O-1605-2014; Ismukhanova, Laura/JZE-1707-2024	Opp, Christian/0000-0001-7034-6945; Ismukhanova, Laura/0000-0001-6421-8621; madibekov, azamat/0000-0001-9303-6640; 														2076-3417				SEP	2022	12	17							8660	10.3390/app12178660	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12178660													WOS:000850980900001
J	Ho, JC; Michalak, AM				Ho, Jeff C.; Michalak, Anna M.			Challenges in tracking harmful algal blooms: A synthesis of evidence from Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are becoming increasingly common in freshwater ecosystems globally, raising complex questions about the factors that influence their initiation and growth. These questions have increasingly been answered through mechanistic and stochastic modeling efforts that rely on historical information about HABs in a given system for development, validation, and calibration. Therefore, understanding processes that control HABs is predicated on the ability to answer much more basic questions about what has actually occurred in a given system, namely questions of HAB occurrence, extent, intensity, and timing. Here we explore the state of the science in answering these basic questions; we use Lake Erie as a case study, where nearly two decades after the resurgence of HABs, a summer 2014 event caused a mandatory three day tap water ban for Toledo, Ohio. We find that, even for well-studied systems, unambiguous answers to basic questions about HAB occurrence are lacking, raising concerns about their use as a basis for addressing mechanistic questions about controlling factors. This ambiguity is found to be caused by differences in the methods used to track HABs, the specific harm being considered, the linkage to that harm (direct or indirect), the threshold defining harm, and spatiotemporal variability in sampling. Further work is therefore needed to integrate heterogeneous types of observations in order to better leverage existing and future monitoring programs, and to guide modeling efforts toward deeper understanding of HAB causes and consequences.

Exploring potential effects of cormorant predation on the fish community in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Stakeholders and fishery managers expressed concern that double-crested cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus predation may be a factor in the recent poor survival of yellow perch Perca flavescens in Saginaw Bay. We quantified cormorant diets from two nesting colonies in Saginaw Bay during April -September in 2013 and 2014, with special emphasis on impacts to yellow perch. Cormorants (n = 691) were collected when returning to colonies after foraging. Stomachs were removed and preserved in the field. Diet items were identified, enumerated, and measured (n = 23.373). Cormorant diets from Saginaw Bay indicate a heavy reliance on round goby and Notropis species as prey during the breeding season, consistent with other areas of the Great Lakes where round goby and cormorants coincide. Respectively, the three most common prey species observed by number (%) and biomass (%) pooled across years and sites were round goby Neogobius melanostomus (56.6%, 42.1%), emerald shiner Notropis antherinoides (25.2%, 12.5%), and yellow perch (8.0%,14.1%). Diet composition was more variable at Spoils Island than at Little Charity Island. Overall cormorant consumption (estimated using cormorant consumption demand rates) of yellow perch was compared to walleye consumption. Cormorant consumption of age-1 yellow perch was 13-17% as much as mean walleye consumption of yellow perch in 2013 and 8-11% in 2014. The cumulative effects of walleye and spring cormorant predation likely represent a recruitment bottleneck for yellow perch in Saginaw Bay. Future studies determining age-specific abundance of yellow perch would facilitate better determination of cormorant predation significance.

This study aims to select the best community-based ecotourism site and type of ecotourism for local community engagement in Abijiata-Shalla Lakes National Park, Ethiopia. The study has been conducted based on geospatial data, field observation, household survey, and key informant discussion and focus group discussion. Analytical Hierarchy Process (APH) model has been used for pair-wise comparison matrix to determine a suitable area for community-based ecotourism. Factors and criteria were identified to determine their weight impact to map and quantify the suitable area for community-based ecotourism. The major portion of the national park, which covers 65.48% is unsuitable for community-based ecotourism development while only 5.1% of the park is highly suitable for community-based ecotourism development due to the forest coverage and numerous biodiversity occurrences. The major types of community-based ecotourism are hot spring water, fike maintains travel and camping, viewpoint and art craft site, ostrich farm, photograph and video making, tourist guides and horse ride. This study can be used for the stakeholders to implement and construct community-based ecotourism interventions.

J	Gohm, A; Siller, M; Bär, J				Gohm, Alexander; Siller, Maria; Baer, Julius			Nature and climatology of Pfanderwind	METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT												The characteristics and climatology of Pfanderwind, a largely unknown downslope windstorm near the town of Bregenz (Austria) at the entrance of the Rhine Valley, are investigated based on an eleven-year dataset of weather station observations and ERA-Interim reanalyses. The goal is to clarify the inconsistency in the definition of this phenomenon, to illuminate its dynamics, and to quantify its frequency of occurrence. It is shown that Pfanderwind has similarities to foehn but does occur for different synoptic-scale conditions. Moreover, two types of Pfanderwind have to be distinguished: Type 1, or classical Pfanderwind, is associated with easterly to northeasterly large-scale flow that crosses the Pfander mountain range, descends in a foehn-like manner and causes moderate to strong winds in the town of Bregenz and its vicinity. The temperature anomaly induced at the surface by adiabatic warming is small as a result of weak low-level stability. Type-1 events occur on average 12 times per year, preferentially in spring, and most frequently between the afternoon and midnight. Type 2, or southeast Pfanderwind, is associated with westerly to southwesterly ambient winds near the main Alpine crest level. The Rhine valley is filled with cold air and in most cases south foehn is not present. However, the synoptic and meso-scale pressure gradient favours southerly ageostrophic flow in the Rhine Valley especially near the top of the cold-air pool. This flow passes the Gebhardsberg, the southwestern extension of the Pfander mountain range, descends on its leeward side and causes strong foehn-like warming at the surface. However, southerly to southeasterly near-surface winds at Bregenz are rather weak. Type-2 events occur on average 40 times per year, most frequently between the evening and the early morning, and exhibit a weak seasonal dependence. More than half of all type-1 and type-2 events last only one or two hours.

Watershed-derived allochthonous (WDA) and phytoplankton-derived autochthonous (PDA) CDOM were exposed to 9 days of natural solar radiation to assess the photobleaching response of different CDOM sources, using absorption and fluorescence (excitation-emission matrix) spectroscopy. Our results showed a marked decrease in total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentration under natural sunlight exposure for both WDA and PDA CDOM, indicating photoproduction of ammonium from TDN. In contrast, photobleaching caused a marked increase in total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) concentration for both WDA and PDA CDOM. Thus TDN: TDP ratios decreased significantly both for WDA and PDA CDOM, which partially explained the seasonal dynamic of TDN: TDP ratio in Lake Taihu. Photobleaching rate of CDOM absorption a(254), was 0.032 m/MJ for WDA CDOM and 0.051 m/MJ for PDA CDOM from days 0-9, indicating that phototransformations were initially more rapid for the newly produced CDOM from phytoplankton than for the river CDOM. Extrapolation of these values to the field indicated that 3.9%-5.1% CDOM at the water surface was photobleached and mineralized every day in summer in Lake Taihu. Photobleaching caused the increase of spectral slope, spectral slope ratio and molecular size, indicating the CDOM mean molecular weight decrease which was favorable to further microbial degradation of mineralization. Three fluorescent components were validated in parallel factor analysis models calculated separately for WDA and PDA CDOM. Our study suggests that the humic-like fluorescence materials could be rapidly and easily photobleached for WDA and PDA CDOM, but the protein-like fluorescence materials was not photobleached and even increased from the transformation of the humic-like fluorescence substance to the protein-like fluorescence substance. Photobleaching was an important driver of CDOM and nutrients biogeochemistry in lake water.

J	Zhang, N; Zhu, LF; Zhu, Y				Zhang Ning; Zhu Lianfang; Zhu Yan			Urban heat island and boundary layer structures under hot weather synoptic conditions: A case study of Suzhou City, China	ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES												A strong urban heat island (UHI) appeared in a hot weather episode in Suzhou City during the period from 25 July to 1 August 2007. This paper analyzes the urban heat island characteristics of Suzhou City under this hot weather episode. Both meteorological station observations and MODIS satellite observations show a strong urban heat island in this area. The maximum UHI intensity in this hot weather episode is 2.2A degrees C, which is much greater than the summer average of 1.0A degrees C in this year and the 37-year (from 1970 to 2006) average of 0.35A degrees C. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation results demonstrate that the rapid urbanization processes in this area will enhance the UHI in intensity, horizontal distribution, and vertical extension. The UHI spatial distribution expands as the urban size increases. The vertical extension of UHI in the afternoon increases about 50 m higher under the year 2006 urban land cover than that under the 1986 urban land cover. The conversion from rural land use to urban land type also strengthens the local lake-land breeze circulations in this area and modifies the vertical wind speed field.					; ZHANG, Ning/R-2607-2018	ZHANG, Ning/0000-0003-2350-5645; 													0256-1530	1861-9533				JUL	2011	28	4					855	865		10.1007/s00376-010-0040-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00376-010-0040-1													WOS:000291994000012

D.; Shemesh, Aldo			Oxygen-isotope geothermometers in lacustrine sediments: New insights through combined δ18O analyses of aquatic cellulose, authigenic calcite and biogenic silica in Lake Gosciaz, central Poland	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Two water-based oxygen-isotope geothermometers (calcite cellulose and silica cellulose) were tested using well-dated intervals of laminated sediment retrieved from Lake Gosciaz, a small hardwater lake in central Poland. Five sections spanning at. 90-200 years of deposition were selected and subsampled at approximately decadal resolution to characterize relatively stable climatic and hydrologic conditions during the middle of the Younger Dryas cold period, the rapid environmental changes that occurred at the Younger Dryas-Preboreal (YD-PB) boundary, and three subsequent periods of relative stability during the early, middle and late Holocene. The two geothermometers are based on the premise that aquatic cellulose delta O-18 serves as a direct proxy for lakewater delta O-18, thereby allowing resolution of temperature signals in delta O-18 records obtained from co-existing authigenic calcite or diatom silica. Qualitatively consistent results from the calcite cellulose geothermometer were obtained for all five intervals, clearly showing the expected low epilimnion water temperatures in the mid-YD, rapid warming during the YD-BP transition and maximum temperatures during the early Holocene, followed by slightly lower temperatures during the middle and late Holocene. Results from the silica cellulose geothermometer also showed lower temperatures during the YD than the late Holocene, although insufficient diatom silica for analysis was present in the intervening intervals. The calcite cellulose geothermometer yielded consistently higher estimates of epilimnion temperatures than the silica cellulose thermometer in the YD and late Holocene intervals, and unrealistically high values throughout the Holocene. We speculate that the calcite cellulose geothermometer is influenced by kinetic effects during rapid carbonate precipitation, which offsets temperature-dependent fractionation and thus leads to high temperature estimates. In contrast, the silica cellulose geothermometer may be affected by the production of diatom silica early in the spring, prior to seasonal warming and isotopic enrichment of the epilimnion, thus generating low temperature estimates.

Microbial community of the chemocline of the meromictic Lake Shunet (Khakassia, Russia) during summer stratification	MICROBIOLOGY												The spatio-temporal organization of the bacterial community inhabiting the chemocline of the stratified meromictic Lake Shunet (Khakassia, Russia) was investigated from May to September 2005 by means of microscopy, analysis of photosynthetic pigments, and PCR-DGGE with subsequent 16S rDNA analysis. The samples were collected with a multisyringe stratification sampler, sampling being performed every 5 cm. It was demonstrated that, during the period of investigation, there were no large changes in the bacterial community of the chlemocline, at least among the detected forms. During the whole period of study, purple sulfur bacteria related to Lamprocystis purpurea (Chromatiaceae) were predominant in the chemocline. Beneath the layer of purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria were revealed that were phylogenetically distant from strain ShNPel02, which was previously isolated from this lake. Development of phytoflagellates of the genus Cryptomonas was observed in the upper zone of the chemocline. In the chemocline of Lake Shunet, the numbers of picoplankton cyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus increased from May to September. It was demonstrated that the application of universal bacterial primers for DGGE resulted in the same qualitative distributional pattern of predominant species as microscopic studies.

Lakes, Ill., during the spring of 1954. Complement-fixation (OF) and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) data are presented on the 37 strains isolated in embryonated eggs from nasal washings of individuals who were ill with an acute respiratory disease. The CF and HI data show that the 1954 strains of influenza B viruses are antigenetically different from the 1940 Lee B, but are related to the 1950 and 1952 influenza B viruses. These observations were borne out with the neutralization test. If only Lee rooster antisera had been used for typing, and the Lee virus as antigen in the serological tests, the newly isolated strains would not have been identified. The CF test was of value only when antigens employed were prepared from the current epidemic strain (GL1760-54B) of influenza B.																			0037-9727						1955	88	3					430	435											14371656					WOS:A1955WE45700033

Since MC congener toxicities vary over 2 orders of magnitude, identification and characterization of the microcystin congener profile can be crucial information when balancing between public health and local economic resilience. Herein, five hydroxyproline (Hyp)-containing MCs were discovered in a Lake Erie cHAB. High-resolution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and thiol derivatization were used in the putative identification of novel MC congeners. Among the five novel congeners, MC-LHyp, MC-HpeHyp, [Dhb7]MC-HilHyp, and [Dhb7]MC-YHyp contained single Hyp at position 4 of the cyclic structure, while MC-HypHyp contained two Hyp residues at positions 2 and 4 of the cyclic structure. The hydroxyproline amino acid imparts a more rigid peptide backbone because it forms a ring by bonding back to the amino group. Hence, the toxicities of Hyp-containing MCs and their isomers need to be elucidated. Furthermore, the discovery of hydroxyproline-containing MCs stresses the importance of understanding the genetic and environmental mechanisms of MC biosynthesis.

J	Torbick, N; Ziniti, B; Wu, S; Linder, E				Torbick, Nathan; Ziniti, Beth; Wu, Shuang; Linder, Ernst			Spatiotemporal Lake Skin Summer Temperature Trends in the Northeast United States	EARTH INTERACTIONS												Lakes have been suggested as an indicator of climate change; however, long-term, systematic records of lake temperature are limited. Satellite remote sensing is capable of supporting lake temperature mapping with the advantage of large-area and systematic observations. The goal of this research application was to assess spatiotemporal trends in lake skin temperature for all lakes over 8 ha across northern New England for the past three decades. Nearly 10 000 Landsat scenes for July, August, and September from 1984 to 2014 were processed using MODTRAN and MERRA parameterizations to generate atmospherically corrected lake skin temperature records. Results show, on average, lakes warmed at a rate of 0.8 degrees C decade(-1), with smaller lakes warming at a faster rate. Complementing regression and space-time analyses showed similar results (R-2 = 0.63) for lake temperature trends and found lakes, on average, are warming faster than daily maximum or minimum air temperature. No major hot spots were found as lake temperature changes were heterogeneous on a local scale and evenly distributed across the region. Maximum and minimum daily temperature, lake size, and elevation were found as significant drivers of lake temperature. This effort provides the first regionally focused and comprehensive spatiotemporal assessment of thousands (n = 3955) of lakes concentrated in one geographic region. The approach is scalable and adaptable to any region for assessing lake temperature trends and potential drivers.																			1087-3562					DEC	2016	20						1	21		10.1175/EI-D-16-0015.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/EI-D-16-0015.1													WOS:000390588600001

In Lake Erie, quaggas were collected as early as 1989 and now are most common in the eastern basin. In Lakes Erie and Ontario, proportions of quaggas increased with depth and decreasing water temperature. ln the eastern basin of Lake Erie, quaggas outnumbered zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by 14 to 1 in deeper waters (>20 m). In Lake Ontario, quaggas were observed at depths as great as 130 m, and both quagga and zebra mussel were found to survive at depths (>50 m) where temperatures rarely exceed 5-degrees-C. Quaggas were sparse or absent along inland waterways and lakes of New York State. Mean shell size ot quagga mussel was larger than that of zebra mussel at sites in the Niagara River, Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River.

Two main vegetation types (Phragmites australis community and P. australis + Typha latifolia community) of Qin Lake wetland were sampled in this study for the analysis of TN and TP contents and reserves in the wetland soils. The results showed that (1) the consumption effect of Qin Lake wetland on soluble N was much more significant than on soluble P. (2) The efficiency of TN enrichment in wetland soil was enhanced by vegetation covering of P. australis and T. latifolia. (3) Wetland soil P was consumed by P. australis community and this pattern was relieved with the introduction of T. latifolia. (4) According to the grey relativity analysis, the most intensive interaction between plants and soil occurred in summer. In addition, the exchange of Nin soil-vegetation system primarily occurred in the 0-15 cm soil layer. Our results indicated that vegetation covering was essential to the enrichment of TN and TP, referring to the biology-related fixation in the wetland soil.																			2090-908X						2017	2017								8539093	10.1155/2017/8539093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/8539093								28299233					WOS:000396246800001

This paper analyses the characteristics and factors that influence the hysteresis of water area-stage curves for Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China characterized by complex geomorphology and upstream-downstream exchange conditions. For this purpose, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (EFDC) based on seven scenarios is established. The results indicate that the area-stage curve presents significant hysteretic characteristics due to different water surface gradients that emerge during the water-rising and water-falling periods. Counter-clockwise, clockwise, and splayed hysteresis directions observed at the northern, southern, and central hydrometric stations, respectively, are found in Poyang Lake for the first time. Upstream catchment inflows and Hukou stage reflecting the downstream condition are the main factors that influence hysteresis. The temporal fluctuation of catchment inflows and Hukou stage has a remarkably positive impact on hysteresis, namely, an increase in fluctuation brings about a larger hysteresis. The effects of magnitude change in the two factors on hysteresis are opposing. Catchment inflows are positively related, while the decline of the Hukou stage will produce a more pronounced hysteresis. The outcomes of this study will benefit the water management of Poyang Lake and other similar large lakes.

J	Melendy, J; Cone, DK				Melendy, J; Cone, DK			Initial infection, distribution, and seasonal occurrence of Hoferellus gilsoni (Myxozoa) within a population of Anguilla rostrata (Anguillidae) in southern Nova Scotia	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Recently transformed elvers of Anguilla rostrata, entering the mouth of the East River in the Timber/Connaught Lake watershed (Nova Scotia) from the sea in mid-May, did not develop infections of the urinary bladder parasite Hoferellus gilsoni (Myxozoa) after nearly 3 mo in captivity. However, 40% of elvers collected from the mouth of the river in early June and 80% in late June exhibited patent infections by mid-August. It is speculated that given this initial level of infection, the summer run of elvers (estimated to be 208,000-963,000 individuals annually) represents a significant upstream dispersal of spores. Infections in yellow eel, which has a limited home range, probably contribute to spore dispersal within the home range and downstream through spore drift. Sporogenesis occurred in samples of yellow eel collected over an 8-mo period from April to November. Eel length was similar in 3 widely separated sampling locations in the watershed. Prevalences at these localities were 44, 36, and 57% in April and, by June, reached 76, 70, and 90%, respectively. Prevalences remained near the June levels until sampling ceased in November 1998. Studies on captive fish suggest that H. gilsoni can overwinter in the eel. Data from the study indicate that immediate infection of young elvers entering the system, effective spore dispersal, and a seasonally extended sporogenesis all contribute to the ubiquitous presence of the parasite in the eel population.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				OCT	2001	87	5					957	960											11695415					WOS:000171782300004
J	Frihy, OE; Dewidar, KM; ElRaey, MM				Frihy, OE; Dewidar, KM; ElRaey, MM			Evaluation of coastal problems at Alexandria, Egypt	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Alexandria is the second largest city in Egypt containing more than one third of the national industries and considered as the principal seaside summer resort on the Mediterranean. The coastal zone is presently experiencing two main problems resulting from natural and human activities: beach erosion and pollution. Most of the Alexandria coasts are rocky and have very little or no beach. Significant erosion occurs along most of Alexandria benches as a result of sediment starvation, coastal processes and sea level rise. One of the most serious threats to the coastal zone comes from inland pollution sources, Mariut lake and sewage pipelines. As a result of increasing population and industrial development, poorly untreated industrial waste, domestic sewage, shipping industry and agricultural runoff are being released to the coast. With the rapid increase in the industries and population, changes in water quality would have potential consequences for the large rapidly growing population of the Alexandria region. Recommendations for environmental recovery and restoration are proposed for preservation of Alexandria resort beaches and harbours in order to facilitate development of environmental and tourist activities.

The alkaline leachate is supersaturated with respect to calcite upstream of the wetland (SIcalcite values +2.3) and becomes less saturated with progress across the wetland, to SIcalcite values of +0.27 at the wetland outlet. Reduction in pH across the wetland (to around pH 8 at the wetland outlet) was observed to be more pronounced over summer months, possibly due to increased microbial activity, possibly further assisted by greater flow baffling by emergent vegetation. Calculated calcite precipitation rates downstream of the leachate source, estimated from hydrochemical data, flow, and surface area, were on the order of 0.4-15 g m(-2) day(-1), while direct measurements (using immersed limestone blocks) showed calcite precipitation values in the range 3-10 g m(-2) day(-1). Precipitation rate was highest in the pH range where the carbonate ion is a dominant constituent of sample alkalinity (pH 9.5-11) and at the locations where wetland biota became established downstream of the leachate emergence. These data provide valuable insights into the potential for using constructed wetlands for the passive treatment of high pH steel slag leachates.					; Mayes, William/B-2393-2012; Younger, Paul/F-7139-2015	Mayes, William/0000-0002-1864-9057; Younger, Paul/0000-0002-7321-8479													0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 15	2006	40	4					1237	1243		10.1021/es051304u	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es051304u								16572781					WOS:000235478700026

Sixty eight multi-purpose dams, accounting for 71 billion m(3) of active volume in total, have been built since the 1960s. It is estimated that an additional sixty seven dams with 68 billion m(3) of active volume will be operational in the next ten years, resulting in highly regulated downstream flows. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was analyzed based on the MODIS satellite sensor images (temporal solution of 16-days), which indicates that the flood protected areas has increased nearly three times in the past 14 years (from 2000 to 2014) in the upper part of the Vietnam Mekong Delta. Flood prevention systems were built to increase rice production from two to three crops a year and to protect residential areas in the floodplain. This development has caused a significant reduction in water retention capacity of the floodplain and higher water levels in adjacent areas. Changes in historical water levels along the lower Mekong River ranging from the most upstream (Kratie) to the middle (Kampong Cham, Phnom Penh, Tan Chau, Chau Doc and Can Tho) and the coast station (Vam Kenh) were also analyzed. Historical alterations in water level patterns (maximum, minimum, rise rate, fall rate and fluctuations) over time were then associated with the development of either dams or flood prevention systems. Rise rates at the Kratie station in the upper part of the floodplain gradually decreased by 25% between 1960 and 2013, but remained rather constant at Phnom Penh, the middle of the floodplain. In the lower part of the floodplain, alterations to water levels, rise rates and fall rates have been higher since 2006, and this corresponds to the operation of flood prevention projects in the Vietnam Mekong Delta. The impact of existing upstream dams on the Vietnam Mekong Delta is currently buffered by the Tonle Sap Lake and Cambodian floodplains. It can be concluded that the development of flood prevention systems is currently a key driver of water level changes in the delta.

A total of 166 specimens was captured in two monthly sampling series, from May 1993 to 1994 and from February to April 1998. There were 45 females and 79 males; nine age classes were present. Regression analysis between total length (TL) and weight (W) was W = 0.0001 x TL3.0366; no significant differences between sexes were recorded. The parameter values for the von Bertalanffy growth curve for length were L-infinity = 162.76 cm, K = 0.089 yr(-1) and t(0) = 0.29 yr. An inverse Lee phenomenon exists for the 2-, 3- and 4-year-old age classes in the Lake Trasimeno population, indicating a differential mortality which favoured the survival of the larger individuals. One-year-old specimens were excluded from this phenomenon. Competition between pike and the exotic species largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides Lac.), recently introduced in Lake Trasimeno, could explain the differential mortality in pike, especially in the smaller specimens during winter.

On-farm assessment of soil erosion and non-point source pollution in a rain-fed vegetable production system at Dianchi lake's catchment, southwestern China	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS												Vegetable is important cash crop in Dianchi lake's catchment, but the non-point source (NPS) pollution from the intensive agricultural production systems is a critical hurdle on the alleviation of serious eutrophication in Dianchi lake. Our objectives were to quantify soil erosion and NPS pollution in rain-fed vegetable production systems at the area. The experiment was a randomized complete factorial design with two plastic mulch treatments (narrow vs. wide plastic mulch) and two rotation treatments (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat vs. broccoli-zucchini-fallow). The narrow-plastic-mulch system has significantly (P < 0.05) increased runoff and soil loss than wide-plastic-mulch system. Results indicated that plastic mulch substantially accelerated runoff generation and soil erosion at vegetable seedling stages, whereas runoff and soil loss were apparently alleviated in furrow with residue mulch. The sediment transport played a predominant role in soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) movement by surface runoff. The annual losses of N and P via surface runoff in the vegetable field were ranged from 2.0 to 5.1 kg/ha and 0.3 to 1.1 kg/ha respectively in the three considerably drier rain season, but their losses never exceeded 1 % of the annual fertilizer application. Removal of crop residues was the major causes of N and P export from the soil in the vegetable fields, which exceeded 20 and 8 % of the annual nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application respectively. This implicated that inappropriately discarding of the residues would pose serious consequences for water contamination of Dianchi lake. As under appropriate discarding of residues, the wide-plastic-mulch system could improve NPS pollution control and crop production in vegetable field at Dianchi lake's catchment.

In this study, RDX in various aqueous samples were detected directly by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) in the positive ion detection mode by using acetic acid to promote protonation of RDX in water solution. Under the optimized working conditions: sample flow rate, 10.0 mu L/min; spray voltage, 6 kV; capillary. temperature, 20090, a detection limit of 1 ng/L was achieved with minimum sample preparation and direct infusion at 10 mu L/min; the dynamic linear range of this method was found to be 0.005-100 g/L; the recovery of RDX in spring water, tap water and lake water was 92%, 99% and 108%,respectively. The procedure took less than 2 min to get analytical results of a single sample with high confidence by performing tandem MS analysis to avoid false positives.

(2012)	HOLOCENE												Empirical data in the form of many chironomid-based temperature reconstructions give an excellent opportunity to assess the chironomid approach to temperature reconstruction by testing its reproducibility. Brooks et al. (The Holocene 22(12) 2012 (this issue)) offer a critique of points discussed in Velle et al. (The Holocene 20 (2010) 989-1002), but fail to explain the poor reproducibility found when Holocene chironomid-based temperature reconstructions are compared. We discuss the issues raised by Brooks et al. (2012) and cite studies that demonstrate the complexity involved. We are grateful to Brooks et al. (2012) for contributing to the discussion. However, they overly rely uncritically on transfer functions and the resulting reconstructions as representatives of true patterns in nature. A major source of bias involved when chironomids are used as a palaeoenvironmental proxy is the response to confounding gradients. Many of the challenges discussed in the Forum Article, in the comment, and in the reply are also valid for other research fields within palaeoecology. The challenges should still be properly addressed in chironomid research.					Willassen, Endre/AEG-0139-2022; Birks, H. John B./C-3103-2008; Birks, John/C-3103-2008	Birks, H.

It gives evidence of centennial-scale fluctuations with major highstands at ca 11500, 11 100, 10200, 9400, 8200, 7300, 6200, 5700-5200, 4850, 4200, 3400, 2600, 1200 and 400 cal BP. Except for the Early Holocene until ca 10 500 cal BP, this pattern of hydrological changes appears to be in agreement with the regional pattern established for west-central Europe. Correlations with the Preboreal oscillation and the 8.2 ka event as well as with the atmospheric C-14 residual series suggest that lake-level fluctuations developed at Accesa in response to (1) final steps of the deglaciation in the North Atlantic area and (2) variations in solar activity. For the period after 4500 cal BP, correlations with other palaeohydrological records from central Italy indicate that lake-level changes reconstructed at Accesa were mainly driven by climatic variations while anthropic activities and local geomorphological factors only played a secondary role. The Accesa lake-level record also highlights millennial-scale variations with a maximal lowstand at ca 9200-7700 cal BP contemporaneous with Sapropel event I in the Mediterranean. It was followed by generally higher lake-level conditions. This appears to be the opposite of that observed in Sicily (southern Italy) where a lake-level maximum developed at ca 9000-8200 cal BP and was followed by a general trend towards aridification. These opposite patterns were interpreted as contrasting hydrological responses to orbitally induced changes in summer insolation. This interpretation has to be tested by further lake-level studies in the central Mediterranean region. Finally, correlations between major lowstands and periods of maximal representation of Quercus ilex point to convergences between climate oscillations and Holocene vegetation history in the Accesa region. However, the maximal representation of Abies during the first half of the Holocene, including a time window where lake level reached a minimal level, suggests a more subtle impact of seasonality processes.

Based on abundance, seasonal dynamics, and cell-specific uptake rates of different ciliate taxa, as well as heterotrophic nanoflagellate bacterivory, we were able to quantify bacterivory by individual ciliate species, total ciliates, and aggregated protists in these systems. With increasing trophic status, a higher portion of bacterial production was consumed by protists, and there was a greater importance of ciliate grazing, accounting for 40 and 50 % of the total protistan bacterivory in the epilimnion of the Rimov and Sau reservoirs, respectively. Increases were attributable to the oligotrichs of the genus Halteria that often numerically dominate freshwater pelagic ciliate communities. In both reservoirs, the most important ciliate bacterivores in order of importance were: oligotrichs, primarily the bacterivorous Halteria spp., peritrichs, and scuticociliates. We also examined food vacuole content in natural populations of Halteria;a spp. to estimate the proportion of cells that had ingested algae. Our results and a review of previous reports on the abundance of Halteria spp. suggest that small halteriids are ecologically important bacterial consumers in meso- to eutrophic freshwater systems due to: (1) efficient uptake of prey over a large size spectrum (approximately 0.4 to 5 pm), (2) high clearance rates on picoplankton-sized particles along with (3) high potential growth rate, and (4) lower vulnerability to metazooplankton predation compared to other common pelagic ciliates. Correspondingly, we suggest a revised concept of planktonic ciliate bacterivory, where the principal role is attributed to small omnivorous filter-feeding oligotrichous ciliates.					; Nedoma, Jiri/F-9063-2014; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021	Jurgens, Klaus/0000-0002-7999-9368; Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; 													0948-3055	1616-1564				JUL 21	2000	22	1					43	56		10.3354/ame022043	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame022043													WOS:000088621100004

Here we propose new calibration models based on the investigation of >100 surface soils across a large climatic gradient, with a particular focus on semiarid and arid regions of China, and apply them to a loess-paleosol sequence. As reported elsewhere, MBT values exhibit a much higher correlation with MAAT than with summer temperature, suggesting a minimal seasonality bias; however, MBT is apparently insensitive to temperature <5 degrees C or >20 degrees C. Additional complexities are apparent in alkaline and arid soils, which are characterized by different relationships to climatic parameters than those in the complete Chinese (or global) dataset. For example, MBT and CBT indices exhibit a negative correlation in alkaline and arid soils, in contrast to their positive correlation in acid soils. Moreover, the cyclization ratio of bGDGTs (CBT), previously defined as a proxy for soil pH, is apparently primarily controlled by MAAT in these alkaline soils. Thus, we propose (1) a local Chinese calibration of the MBT-CBT proxy and (2) an alternative temperature proxy for use in semiarid and arid regions based on the fractional abundances of bGDGTs; the latter has a markedly higher determination factor and lower root mean square error in alkaline soils than the Chinese local calibration and is suggested to be preferred for paleotemperature reconstruction in Chinese loess/paleosol sequences. These new bGDGT proxies have been applied to the Weinan Holocene paleosol section of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). The fractional abundance calibration, when applied in the Weinan Holocene paleosol, produces a total Holocene temperature variation of 5.2 degrees C and a temperature for the topmost sample that is consistent with the modern temperature. Previously, we showed that the ratio of archaeal isoprenoid GDGTs to bGDGTs (R-i/b) increases at MAP <600 mm, and elevated R-i/b values (>0.5) in the CLP suggest the presence of enhanced aridity in the late Holocene in North China. In combination, the high R-i/b ratios (>0.5) and the associated low MBT values (<0.4) reveal the co-occurrence of dry and cold events, especially in the latest Holocene, in the loess-paleosol sequences in CLP, and probably also in cold and arid regions outside of CLP.

TRIN. ON EPIPHYTIC ALGAE IN RIPARIAN BUFFER ZONE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN					10th Symposium on Trace Elements in the Food Chain	MAY 11-14, 2008	Pulawy, POLAND					In this study the concentration of 13 chemical elements in reed shoots and the density of epiphytic algae (phyto-periphyton) in the Vistula Lagoon were analysed. The highest content reached iron and among the alkali metals-calcium. Epiphytic macroflora inhabiting reed in the investigated reservoir was predominated by Bacillariophyta (genus Nitzchia sp.) and Chlorophyta (Stigeoclonium sp.). Chemical elements accumulated in reed shoots, particularly iron and calcium, strongly correlated with density of the consecutive epiphytic algae. In order to reveal the influence of reed substrate and environmental factors on the qualitative and quantitative composition of epiphytic algae, the ordination methods were applied (principal component analysis- PCA, canonical correspondence analysis- CCA, detrended correspondence analysis- DCA). The results showed, that Cynibella sp. as well as Cocconeis sp. preferred spring months, higher concentration of Pb, Na and lower content of Mn. In turn, low concentration of Pb, higher of Zn, Mn and K favoured Bacillariophyta of non-identified genera. The remaining taxa occurred abundantly under moderate accumulation of the analysed chemical elements.																			1018-4619						2010	19	2A			SI		348	353																WOS:000275759100013
J	Mohammadi, A				Mohammadi, Ali			HETEROGENEOUS LONG-TERM AND SEASONAL BRINE EVOLUTION, AND ARTEMIA FECAL PELLET CONTROLS ON URMIA LAKE (NW IRAN) SALT-CRUST FORMATION AND MINERALOGY	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Urmia Lake resides as a substantial hypersaline lake characterized by notable fluctuations in water salinity, brine composition, and water level over long-term, annual, and seasonal intervals. Extremely rapid water elevation fall (> 7 m) in the last three decades has caused the formation of a salt crust on the lake floor. A manmade stone causeway divided the lake into two relatively deeper northern parts with minimal water inputs and a shallower southern part with maximal river inflows. Restricted water flow through the narrow water passage of the causeway leads to complex salinity processes, brine evolution, and salt-crust formation in Urmia Lake. This research analyzes the ionic composition of lake-sediment and salt-crust pore water, the mineralogy of salt crusts, and the ionic composition of both surface and deep lake waters during both the wet and dry seasons of 2019. The findings indicate that the northern and southern parts of the lake undergo stratification during wet seasons due to significant freshwater input, whereas they become homogenized during dry seasons through progressive evaporative concentration and water mixing. The spatial and temporal variations in the lake brine type (primary Na-Mg-Cl) and ionic composition contribute to the formation of a halite salt crust (NaCl > 97%) with heterogeneous mineralogy and thickness. In Urmia Lake, the variable thickness and mineralogy of the exposed marginal salt crust suggest rapid salt-crust reorganization by annual and seasonal deposition and dissolution processes. Conversely, the submerged central salt crust, with continuous thickening and constant mineralogy, remains unaffected by seasonal variations in brine type and dissolution processes. It is noteworthy to mention that Artemia (a brine shrimp) controls the mineralogy of the lake salt crust through the deposition of calcium and carbonate ions in the form of biochemical fecal pellets.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				NOV	2024	94	6					854	870		10.2110/jsr.2024.070	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2024.070													WOS:001415924500004

We focus on the application of a new version of the one-dimensional hydrodynamic model to Lake Kinneret and simulation of the physical processes. DYRESM is calibration-free process-based model that simulates the vertical distribution of temperature and salinity in lakes and reservoirs. The current model is a complete rewrite of the original DYRESM code. Each algorithm was simplified to the essential minimum physical description yielding a more robust and faster model. The new model underwent validation with a high quality dataset from Lake Kinneret. The model simulation reproduced the temperature of the surface layer of the water column to within less than I degreesC. Results of a sensitivity analysis indicated that the surface and bottom water temperatures were most sensitive to changes in long-wave radiation. We conclude from the results that the simplified version of DYRESM accurately simulated the physical processes in the lake although planned inclusion of a benthic boundary-layer routine will improve the model's ability to simulate the bottom temperatures.

Efficient wind energy projects rely on accurate wind resource estimates, which are complex to obtain offshore due to the temporal and spatial sparseness of observations, and the potential for temporal data gaps introduced by the formation of ice during winter months, especially in freshwater lakes. For this study, in situ observations from 70 coastal stations and 20 buoys provide diurnal, seasonal, and interannual wind variability information, with time series that range from 3 to 11 years in duration. Remotely-sensed equivalent neutral winds provide spatial information on the wind climate. NASA QuikSCAT winds are temporally consistent at a 25 km resolution. ESA Synthetic Aperture Radar winds are temporally sparse but at a resolution of 500 m. As an initial step, each data set is processed independently to create a map of 90 m wind speeds. Buoy data are corrected for ice season gaps using ratios of the mean and mean cubed of the Weibull distribution, and reference temporally-complete time series from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Generalized wind climates are obtained for each buoy and coastal site with the wind model WAsP, and combined into a single wind speed estimate for the Great Lakes region. The method of classes is used to account for the temporal sparseness in the SAR data set and combine all scenes into one wind speed map. QuikSCAT winds undergo a seasonal correction due to lack of data during the cold season that is based on its ratio relative to buoy time series. All processing steps reduce the biases of the individual maps relative to the buoy observed wind climates. The remote sensing maps are combined by using QuikSCAT to scale the magnitude of the SAR map. Finally, the in situ predicted wind speeds are incorporated. The mean spatial bias of the final map when compared to buoy time series is 0.1 ms(-1) and the RMSE 03 ms(-1), which represents an uncertainty reduction of 50% relative to using only SAR, and of 40% to using only SAR and QuikSCAT without in situ observations.

J	RITSEMA, R				RITSEMA, R			DISSOLVED BUTYLTINS IN MARINE WATERS OF THE NETHERLANDS 3 YEARS AFTER THE BAN	APPLIED ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY												In 1990 the Dutch government banned the use of tributyltin-containing antifouling paint for ships up to 25 m long. Concentrations of dissolved (<0.45 mum) tributyltin and its degradation products di- and mono-butyltin were determined in six selected marinas during three consecutive years with a frequency of five times a year, starting in 1990. The highest butyltin concentrations were found in Scharendijke located in the salt-water lake Grevelingen: up to 2500 ng dm-3. In tidal-water marinas butyltin concentrations were in the order of 50-300 ng dm-3, depending on the boating and dredging activity. In some marinas higher butyltin concentrations were found during the summer period, probably indicating the illegal use of tributyltin-containing antifouling paints. No clear trend of decrease in dissolved tributyltin concentrations in the different marinas has been found. Due to the equilibrium between the butyltins dissolved in the water and the butyltins adsorbed onto the sediment, water concentrations will remain more or less constant.																			0268-2605					JAN	1994	8	1					5	10		10.1002/aoc.590080103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aoc.590080103													WOS:A1994NA94800002

Life history variation in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and the effects of diet and migration on the growth, condition, and body morphology of two Arctic charr populations in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758)) are phenotypically plastic with multiple dietary-morphological relationships observed throughout their circumpolar range. Feeding strategies often differ between Arctic charr life histories and can impact size-at-age and morphological attributes. We examined growth, condition, and body morphology for two High Arctic populations of Arctic charr with anadromous and landlocked life histories. Anadromous Arctic charr had higher growth rates, achieving mean lengths two times those of landlocked Arctic charr by age 10 and had higher overall condition, particularly in the fall. Ontogenetic shifts in diet were suspected in both populations, with an abrupt shift to marine feeding in the anadromous population and a gradual shift to piscivory in the landlocked population. Morphological differences between life histories manifested most predominantly in larger eye diameter, longer pectoral and pelvic fins, and longer upper jaws of landlocked Arctic charr, suggestive of piscivorous feeding specialization of landlocked fish >350 mm. Our findings emphasize the benefits that marine feeding can have for growth and condition of freshwater fishes in Arctic environments and also convey the necessity of adaptive feeding strategies to optimize growth and condition in fishes inhabiting low-production lacustrine habitats.					; Ogle, Derek/AAT-2617-2020	Ogle, Derek/0000-0002-0370-9299; 														2368-7460				JUN	2021	7	2			SI		436	453		10.1139/as-2019-0036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2019-0036													WOS:000672826800005

However, studies on links between climate change and variations in earlier civilization are limited due to the scarcity of macroscale monsoon precipitation records. In the present study, a similar to 4,000-year record of monsoon precipitation, which represents average rainfall in large areas in northern China, was reconstructed from sediments in Northern Yellow Sea Mud (NYSM). The record shows high monsoon precipitation during similar to 4,000-2,500 BP, similar to 1,350-750 BP and the past similar to 250 years. In general, our record of monsoon precipitation exhibits trends similar to the percentages of planted Poaceae pollen in lake sediments and the Chinese economic index, contrasting with the frequency of wars over the past 2,000 years. We postulated that, in the agricultural society of ancient China, low monsoon precipitation in northern China may be an important factor that cause reduced agricultural production, declined economy and even the occurrence of wars.					; Jixiao, Zhang/ABC-5387-2021; Zhou, Xin/AIE-7442-2022	Tu, Luyao/0000-0001-9593-556X; Zhou, Xin/0000-0003-2640-6431														2296-6463				JUL 31	2020	8								317	10.3389/feart.2020.00317	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00317													WOS:000565330300001

Daily precipitation and stream isotope data, weekly lake and spring isotope data and monthly groundwater isotope data revealed important insights into flow pathways and mixing of water at both scales. In particular, a deeper groundwater flow path significantly contributes to total streamflow (25-50%). Upstream lake isotope dynamics, susceptible to evaporative fractionation, also appeared to have an important influence on the downstream isotope composition. This unique tracer data set facilitated the conceptualization of a lumped catchment-scale flow-tracer model. The incorporation of hydrological, mixing and fractionation processes based on these data improved simulations of the stream delta H-2 isotope response at the catchment outlet from 0.37 to 0.56 for the Nash-Sutcliffe statistic. The stable isotope data successfully aided model conceptualization and calibration in the quest for a simple water and solute transport model with improved representation of process dynamics.

A palsa peat profile was investigated to establish a chronology of mire initiation and permafrost development during the Holocene. Macrofossils show that tree birch was present in the study area at the beginning of the Holocene and stands of spruce became established shortly thereafter. However, pollen evidence suggests that almost 400 years passed before the area was occupied by a mixed spruce-birch forest, which lasted until ca. 5000 BP. Subsequently, the area reverted to forest-tundra. Paludification began ca. 9000 BP continuing at least until 5700 BP. The conditions were permafrost-free at least until 4500 BP. The latest permafrost aggradation phase is dated to the Little Ice Age. We interpret summer temperatures to have been ca. 3-4degreesC higher between ca. 8900 and 5500 BP than at present, and the lowest temperature regime of the Holocene to have occurred between 2700 and 2100 BP.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				OCT	2004	41	10					1141	1158		10.1139/E04-058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E04-058													WOS:000225268800001

However, meristic characters vary with environmental factors: for example stocks inhabiting cooler waters during spawning and larval development typically show higher vertebral means. Here we have samples of fertilized vendace eggs which were preserved and their myomeres were counted. Further, vendace larvae were collected in spring 1992 from seven lakes in Finland and from one lake in Russia for the purpose of studying the variation in preanal myomere counts among lakes situated in the southern and the northern part of the distribution area. The larvae were sampled from each lake when they were at the size of 14-17 mm, except from one lake where the larvae were 10 mm. We found that the counts were nearly stable between 95 d and 191 d after fertilization, the average myomere counts differed significantly between lakes, the highest counts were observed in the coldest lakes and no correlation between total length and myomere count was observed.

J	Bohra, A; Kotlia, BS				Bohra, Archna; Kotlia, Bahadur Singh			Tectono-climatic signatures during Late Quaternary in the Yunam basin, Baralacha Pass (upper Lahaul valley, India), derived from multi-proxy records	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This study provides evidence of the monsoon record over the past 25 ka from the Kilang Sarai palaeolake which is located in NW Himalaya in the rain shadow zone of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). The multi-proxy study by using geomorphology, carbon isotopes, mineral magnetism, clay mineralogy and elemental chemistry of a 8 m thick laminated lacustrine sediments indicates that the area experienced fluctuating precipitation conditions during the last 25 ka. The time period between 12 and 5 ka BP can be regarded as a very wet interval of the Last Glacial to mid Holocene due to a combined effect of ISM and Westerlies, followed by aridity after 5 ka BP. Tectonic triggers may have caused the development of terraces and closure of lake. At the millennial time scale, a correlation of precipitation and vegetational changes between our data and other records from similar geographical settings suggests that Kilang Sarai basin responded to periods of strengthening in precipitation during the Last Glacial to early Holocene.

The chronology and provenance, and their environmental implications, of these aeolian sediments have been debated for decades. Based on the OSL chronology, sedimentology, grain size analysis, and elementary data, we conclude that: (1) The source materials for the aeolian sediments in the Poyang lake region originated from the local flood plains of the Yangtze River and its tributary Ganjiang River, whose fine materials were transported by the strong northwestern winter monsoon wind. (2) Aeolian deposits occurred throughout Late Pleistocene. Loess has a timing interval of 160-25 ka, concentrating in 115-50 ka. Sand accumulated as early as 115 ka, actively occurred during 85-80 ka. (3) Compared with the channel of the Yangtze River of today, the channel was further to the north before 80-85 ka in the Last Interglaciation, and shifted southward afterward. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Coats, R				Coats, Robert			Climate change in the Tahoe basin: regional trends, impacts and drivers	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The purpose of this study was to quantify the decadal-scale time trends in air temperature, precipitation phase and intensity, spring snowmelt timing, and lake temperature in the Tahoe basin, and to relate the trends to large-scale regional climatic trends in the western USA. Temperature data for six long-term weather stations in the Tahoe region were analyzed for trends in annual and monthly means of maximum and minimum daily temperature. Precipitation data at Tahoe City were analyzed for trends in phase (rain versus snow), decadal standard deviation, and intensity of rainfall. Daily streamflow data for nine gaging stations in and around the Tahoe basin were examined for trends in snowmelt timing, by two methods, and an existing record for the temperature of Lake Tahoe was updated. The results for the Tahoe basin, which contrast somewhat with the surrounding region, indicate strong upward trends in air temperature, a shift from snow to rain, a shift in snowmelt timing to earlier dates, increased rainfall intensity, increased interannual variability, and continued increase in the temperature of Lake Tahoe. Two hypotheses are suggested that may explain why the basin could be warming faster than surrounding regions. Continued warming in the Tahoe basin has important implications for efforts to manage biodiversity and maintain clarity of the lake.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				OCT	2010	102	3-4					435	466		10.1007/s10584-010-9828-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-010-9828-3													WOS:000282129400004

Each sample was representative of several kilometers of river stretch. At sub-toxic doses, the samples were not mutagenic to the Salmonella typhimurium his(-) strains TA98, TA100 and TA102, irrespective of the presence of S9 mix. However, they induced a mutagenic response in YG1024, which is typically reverted by frameshift mutagens that are metabolized in bacteria via acetyl-CoA:N-hydroxylamine O-acetyltransferase. Mutagenicity of sediments was higher during the cold season and had a spatial distribution consistent with the occurrence of pollution sources and confluence with polluted tributaries. Nevertheless, in the final stretch, near the Po delta into the Adriatic Sea, mutagenicity of sediments was low, comparable to that detected in the Po proximal reach, not far away from its springs. Genotoxicity biomarkers were evaluated in three cyprinid species, the "Italian nase" (Chondrostoma soetta), chub (Leuciscus cephalus), and barbel (Barbus plebejus), captured upstream and downstream of the confluence of a polluted tributary (Lambro River) with the Po River. There was no difference between the two areas concerning concentrations of fluorescent aromatic compounds in fish bile while, after metabolic activation, the bile of fish caught from the more polluted area became mutagenic to YG1024. Moreover, the levels of adducts to liver DNA were significantly higher in L. cephalus caught from the more polluted area, and the increase of micronucleated erythrocyte frequency was borderline to statistical significance, but only in C. soetta. Thus, certain biomarkers of exposure and effect in fish, as assessed under field conditions. correlate with the pollution of river sediments by mutagenic compounds. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The sediment nitrogen is divided into ion-exchangeable nitrogen (IEF-N), weak acid-extractable nitrogen (WAEF-N), strong alkaline-extractable nitrogen (SAEF-N), strong oxidant-extractable nitrogen (SOEF-N) and non-transformable (NTN) by sequential extraction methods. Redundancy analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient are used to study the relationship between the physicochemical properties of sediment and overlying water and the various nitrogen forms. Results show that the sediment total nitrogen (TN) content is 480.79-3933.00 mg/kg, with a mean value of 2441.82 mg/kg, of which transformable nitrogen (TTN) accounts for 24.77% of TN. The contents of each TTN are in the order of SAEF-N > IEF-N > WAEF-N > SOEF-N. Except WAEF-N and SOEF-N, the distribution of IEF-N and SAEF-N is consistent with that of TN, which is in the order of central lake > northern lake > estuary. The distribution of nitrogen forms in the sediments is significantly influenced by the physicochemical properties of overlying water and sediments in Poyang Lake in winter, especially the DO and Chl-a in the overlying water, and TP and Chl-a in sediments.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2022	31	10					10428	10438																WOS:000883305600060

Biological Nitrogen Fixation Prevents the Response of a Eutrophic Lake to Reduced Loading of Nitrogen: Evidence from a 46-Year Whole-Lake Experiment	ECOSYSTEMS												A whole-ecosystem experiment in Lake 227 (L227) at the Experimental Lakes Area, ongoing since 1969, examined the roles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in controlling eutrophication. During 2011, we conducted a series of sub-experiments and more intensive monitoring to improve estimates of N fixation and its ability to meet algal growth demands in the decades following the cessation of artificial N loading, while maintaining long-term high artificial P loading. Stoichiometric nutrient ratios indicated both moderate N and P limitation of the phytoplankton during spring, preceding a shift in phytoplankton community structure toward dominance by N fixing cyanobacteria. During bloom development, and for the remainder of the stratified period, stoichiometric nutrient ratios indicated moderate to strong P limitation. N fixation rates, corrected using N-15(2) methods, increased 2x after 1990, when N loading ceased. Ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen prior to the bloom represented less than 3% of N demands of the phytoplankton. N fixation accounted for between 69-86% of total N loading to the epilimnion during the period of rapid bloom development, and 72-86% of total N loading during the May-October period. Phytoplankton biomass did not decline in L227 during the 40years since artificial N loading was reduced, or the nearly 25years since artificial N loads ceased entirely (1990-2013), and remained approximately 20x higher than four nearby reference lakes. These results suggest that despite constraints on biological N fixation, it retains a large capacity to offset potential N loading reductions in freshwaters.

In these environments, proteolytic microbial decomposers may play a large role in protein hydrolysis. We isolated 71 microbial strains showing proteolytic activity at 4 degrees C from three Antarctic freshwater lakes. They were classified as bacteria (63 isolates) and eukaryotes (8 isolates). The bacterial isolates were classified into the genera Flavobacterium (28 isolates), Pseudomonas (14 isolates), Arthrobacter (10 isolates), Psychrobacter (7 isolates), Cryobacterium (2 isolates), Hymenobacter (1 isolate), and Polaromonas (1 isolate). Five isolates of Flavobacterium and one of Hymenobacter seemed to belong to novel species. All eukaryotic isolates belonged to Glaciozyma antarctica, a psychrophilic yeast species originally isolated from the Weddell Sea near the Joinville Island, Antarctica. A half of representative strains were psychrophilic and did not grow at temperatures above 25 degrees C. The protease secreted by Pseudomonas prosekii strain ANS4-1 showed the highest activity among all proteases from representative isolates. The results of inhibitor tests indicated that nearly all the isolates secreted metalloproteases. Proteases from four representative isolates retained more than 30% maximal activity at 0 degrees C. These results expand our knowledge about microbial protein degradation in Antarctic freshwater lakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

J	BOTTEMA, S				BOTTEMA, S			A LATE QUATERNARY POLLEN DIAGRAM FROM LAKE URMIA (NORTHWESTERN IRAN)	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												In this study, the Late Glacial and Holocene vegetation and climate development of the Urmia region in northwestern Iran are discussed. The pollen evidence indicates that Artemisia steppe dominated the area up to about 9000 yr B.P. Precipitation, possibly in the form of torrential showers, ran off directly to the lake basin. Some increase in precipitation enabled a grass steppe to develop during the middle part of the Late Glacial. During this period detrital minerals were hardly transported to the lake. It is assumed that the increase in precipitation caused an increase in vegetation cover which in turn prevented direct run-off. Between 9000 and 8000 yr B.P. forest-steppe developed and c. 7000 yr B.P. vegetation became established that is similar to the present vegetation. The pollen diagrams of Urmia, Zeribar (Iran), Van (eastern Turkey) and Akgol (central Turkey) were correlated with each other. The age of the Van diagram, based upon varve dating, falls out of line, which throws doubt upon the validity of the dating method for this site.																			0034-6667	1879-0615				MAY	1986	47	3-4					241	+		10.1016/0034-6667(86)90039-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0034-6667(86)90039-4													WOS:A1986C797800004
J	Cousquer, Y; Jourde, H				Cousquer, Yohann; Jourde, Herve			Reducing uncertainty of karst aquifer modeling with complementary hydrological observations for the sustainable management of groundwater resources	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A quantitative estimation of the sustainability of groundwater resources is a challenge for water supply in most regions of the world. Sustainability can be estimated through numerical simulation, but uncertainty of models somehow limits the reliability of models' predictions. To overcome this limitation, we explore how parametric and predictive uncertainties is reduced by adding complementary groundwater and surface water dynamics data to a lumped parameter model. This is illustrated with the example of a Mediterranean karst hydrosystem pumped at high flow rate (similar to 1 m(3) s(-1)) to supply water to about 350,000 habitants. A lumped parameter model was set up to simulate spring discharge, water table levels and surface water discharge measured within this karst hydrosystem over a 40 year period. Then, a parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification, based on groundwater discharge, water table levels and surface water discharge observations, was conducted with a Bayesian approach. Our study illustrates how the consideration of complementary hydrological data allows reducing parametric and predictive uncertainty and improving model performance. The model is then applied to assess the impact of an increasing groundwater abstraction according to different prospective scenarios, with a focus on the storage and dynamic of flux between the different compartments of the karst hydrosystem. Based on simulation results and related predictive uncertainty, a groundwater abstraction threshold, which must not be exceeded for a sustainable management of the groundwater resource, is determined.

J	Kurek, P; Dobrowolska, D				Kurek, Przemyslaw; Dobrowolska, Dorota			Acorns dispersal by jays Garrulus glandarius onto clear-cuts and under the forest canopy	SYLWAN												The aim of this study was to analyse the preferences of jays in terms of oak acorn deposition in accordance to availability of some types of habitat. Investigations were carried out in forested areas of the Olsztyn Lakeland (NE Poland) with Scots pine forests domination. In autumn of 2014 and 2015 122 acorns of Quercus robur with concealed Telenax transmitters were served in four locations and then dispersed by jays Garrulus glandarius. Acorns with transmitters were radio tracked and localized after dispersion in different types of habitats. We distinguished three types of habitat: forest stands >40 years old, young forests <25 years old as well as clear-cuts and other open areas. The availability of habitats were estimated by 144 random points (36 per each location). Obtained availability/utilisation data were analyzed with chi square test (alpha=0.05). Results showed that majority (76.4%) of dispersed acorns were deposited under canopy of Scots pine stands, while only 8.2% were deposited on clear-cuts and other open areas. It seems that jays avoid to scatter its caches among clear-cuts and other open areas when availability of these types of environment is compared. Jays preferred to scatter the acorns under canopy of older (>40 years old) stands. It proves that the regeneration of oaks in clear-cuts is with low probability of success. The results suggest that density and high quality of regeneration that occurred on some of the clear-cuts seem to be a synchronization relic of oaks' mast crop and Scots pine fellings. In these circumstances the best solution to obtain oak regeneration is to synchronize the harvest with mast crops and carry it out immediately after acorn production to make an oak regeneration success guaranteed.

Evaluating the growth characteristics of a glacial lake and its degree of danger of outburst flooding: Imja Glacier, Khumbu Himal, Nepal	NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY												The Imja Glacier Lake (Imja Tsho) (1.03 km2 in 2007) is repeatedly cited as one of the most dangerous glacial lakes in the Himalaya with a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) claimed to be imminent. Knowledge of lake development and its dynamics, however, is limited and forecasts of a possible outburst are not scientifically based. Nevertheless, prospects for such a catastrophe are repeatedly exaggerated, attracting alarmist mass media coverage. The paper provides an assessment of the lake expansion rates from 1956 to 2007. Stage 1 (1956-1975), slowest: coalescence of several small supra-glacial ponds; Stage 2 (1975-1978), a short period of most rapid expansion; Stage 3 (1978-1997), slow: gradual expansion of single lake; and Stage 4 (1997-2007), renewed acceleration: mainly eastward expansion into the glacier surface. The lake's water level has fallen from 5041 m to 5004 m (1964-2006). The results show that there is no immediate danger of catastrophic outburst although the dynamics of up-glacier and down-valley lake expansion, fluctuation of lake water level, and dead-ice morphology changes should be continuously and comprehensively monitored. Alarmist prognostications based solely upon rapid areal expansion are counterproductive.																			0029-1951	1502-5292					2009	63	4					255	267	PII 917366277	10.1080/00291950903368367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00291950903368367													WOS:000272592800004

Reducing nitrogen contamination from agricultural subsurface drainage with denitrification bioreactors and controlled drainage	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												Reactive nitrogen leaving agricultural fields through subsurface drainage systems enters aquatic systems and contributes to eutrophication, habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity. Denitrification bioreactors, in combination with controlled drainage, are proposed as a means of reducing nitrogen emitted through subsurface agricultural drainage systems, but their suitability in colder climates where soils and drainage systems freeze during winter is poorly understood. This study presents the first field scale evaluation of denitrification bioreactors under cold climate conditions during a three-year period in Quebec, Canada. Under a three-year crop rotation, about 55% of the total annual subsurface drainage water passed through bioreactors, which significantly lowered the total-nitrogen (72%) and nitrate-nitrogen (99%) median concentrations in the subsurface drainage outflows. Loadings of nitrate-nitrogen from the test fields to surface drainage ditches were reduced by 99%, equivalent to about 11 kg nitrate-nitrogen ha(-1) year(-1) removal in the test area and approximately 7 g nitrate-nitrogen removal m(-3) bioreactor volume d(-1). Aquatic environmental criteria non-compliance events declined by 96% for nitrate-nitrogen and by 50% for total-nitrogen during the three-year study. This study demonstrates that denitrification bioreactors, combined with controlled drainage, are an effective in-field technology for nitrogen removal from agricultural subsurface drainage water that will improve water quality under cold climate conditions.

J	Slootman, A; Cartigny, MJB				Slootman, Arnoud; Cartigny, Matthieu J. B.			Cyclic steps: Review and aggradation-based classification	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Cyclic steps are a type of upper flow-regime bedform consisting of trains of upstream- and upslope-migrating bed undulations. The overriding flow is characterised by a series of hydraulic jumps occurring in the troughs of the undulations. Cyclic steps form in open-channel flows such as rivers and comprise a common bedform in subaqueous density flows in oceans, lakes and reservoirs. Cyclic steps are associated with alternating Froude-sub-critical and Froude-supercritical flow on respectively the stoss side and lee side of individual bedforms. The transition between these flow states is embodied by the hydraulic jump in the trough of the bedform, leading to the permanent or quasi-permanent morphology of cyclic steps. Over the past decade, numerous studies affirmed the dominant role of cyclic steps in generating bed undulations in modern and ancient glacial outwash, fluvial, delta and turbidite environments as reviewed here. Cyclic steps were previously discriminated as net-depositional (climbing), transportational and net-erosional (falling) in different parts of sedimentary systems. The following cyclic step descriptors, with distinct depositional signatures, are proposed: fully depositional, partially depositional, transportational, partially erosional and fully erosional. Partially depositional cyclic steps are most common. They are associated with backset-bedded sets (high aggradation rate) and nested scours filled with massive-to-backset-bedded deposits (low aggradation rate). The new classification can be used as a predictive tool in the reconstruction of modern and ancient sedimentary successions using repeat bathymetry, seismic reflection or outcrop data. It is applied in three turbidite case studies: classical deep-sea system, small-scale delta slope and line-sourced carbonate slope.

J	OJIMA, T				OJIMA, T			CHANGING TOKYO METROPOLITAN-AREA AND ITS HEAT-ISLAND MODEL	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS												Tokyo region consists of Tokyo Metropolis and Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures. Its population has been growing from 17.8 million in 1960 to 31 million in 1985 and is predicted to reach 35 million in 2000. The temperature in Tokyo has gone up by 2 degrees on average, and its humidity has fallen by 15% during the last hundred years, and the phenomena of 'heat island' and 'dust dome' have arisen. As a consequence of the heat island phenomenon, from the industrial areas of Tokyo Bay, SO(x), NO(x), CO(x) and dust particles flow into the residential areas of the city center, rise up from areas of Ikebukuro and Shinjuku, float 100-300 meters up in the air, and fall down as photochemical smog over the central areas and round about within a 20-km radius. These are the most overpopulated residential areas, and the green areas and the dwellers suffer from it. The first cause of the heat island phenomenon is the changes of the natural surface of the earth. Lakes, ponds and the green areas have been ruined and whole central areas have been covered with asphalt and concrete to be roads and buildings. Canals, rivers and bays have been filled up with earth. The second cause is the increase of energy consumption brought by high activities of production and consumption in Tokyo. Working out the effect of these heat impacts upon the air, the changes of the natural surface of the earth increase the temperature of the first 25 meters of upper air by 1-degrees-C, and the artificial heat discharged from thermal power plants and the like, increase it by 0.5-degrees-C. To prevent heat island phenomena, we have to split up a heat island into pieces by putting 'the deep underground space' to practical use. By cutting up the succession of city areas by making greenbelts and canals, we can make 'cool islands' among segregated heat islands. To prevent the dust-dome phenomenon, we have to decentralize industries set along Tokyo Bay. By building urban residential and industrial complexes, we can prevent polluted air from flowing into central city areas. Taking measures to meet the prevention of the phenomena of heat island and dust dome means making fire interception belts in case of predicted disasters over wide Tokyo areas. For safety as well as for health, it is important and expected that Tokyo will be reconstructed.																			0378-7788						1991	15	1-2					191	203		10.1016/0378-7788(90)90131-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-7788(90)90131-2													WOS:A1991FW70000024

The elemental composition of the material was nearly independent of depth. The stoichiometry was {(SiO2)4(CaCO3)106.cntdot.(CH2O)106(NH3)16(H3PO4)1}. Calcite, quartz and clay minerals were detected by X-ray diffraction. No Fe-bearing phase producing X-ray reflections or electron diffraction was found. Iron oxides and iron oxide hydroxides seem to be important sinks for phosphate. Iron(III) is most likely present as amorphous FeOOH. It is capable of adsorbing phosphate as shown by a good correlation between oxalate extractable Fe and oxalate extractable phosphate in the underlying sediments. Mn oxidizing microorganisms were found 1 m above the lake bottom, together with extremely high total concentrations of Mn, both in unfiltered water samples and in the collected sedimented particulate matter. A point analysis by X-ray fluorescence spectrum of the organisms showed a very high Mn/Ca ratio.					; Sigg, Laura/AAI-3504-2020	Sigg, Laura/0000-0002-2210-2951; 													0036-7842						1981	42	2					89	100																WOS:A1981LP57100001
J	Schlegel, I; Krienitz, L; Hepperle, D				Schlegel, I; Krienitz, L; Hepperle, D			Variability of calcification of Phacotus lenticularis (Chlorophyta, Chlamydomonadales) in nature and culture	PHYCOLOGIA												In north-eastern German hardwater lakes, the unicellular flagellate Phacotus lenticularis (Chlorophyta, Chlorophyceae, Chlamydomonadales) occurs regularly in mass developments during the summer months. The most striking characteristic of this chlamydophycean alga is the presence of a calcified two-shelled lens-like lorica. The morphology of P. lenticularis loricae in 10 lakes was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Four lorica morphotypes could be discriminated; several were observed together even within a single water sample. We developed an artificial culture medium that imitated the chemical conditions of hardwater lakes to such an extent that calcified loricae were formed that were highly similar to those found under natural conditions. Phacotus strains from three of the lakes were studied with respect to their calcification patterns under defined culture conditions. Each strain produced a lorica morphology that corresponded to one of those occurring in the lake from which it had been isolated. The new culture medium is potentially useful for investigations focusing on the mechanisms of calcification in other freshwater organisms or autochthonous calcite precipitation.																			0031-8884					JUL	2000	39	4					318	322		10.2216/i0031-8884-39-4-318.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-39-4-318.1													WOS:000165726100006
J	Paulsson, O; Widerlund, A				Paulsson, Oscar; Widerlund, Anders			Diel variations in dissolved oxygen concentration and algal growth in the Laver pit lake, northern Sweden	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The diel oxygen technique relying on automated in-situ measurements of dissolved oxygen was used as an indicator of seasonal and diurnal variations of photosynthesis in the circumneutral Laver pit lake in northern Sweden. From July to September 2017, surface water temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and dissolved oxygen were continuously measured at a time resolution of 30 min using sensors mounted on a floating buoy. The data could be monitored in real-time using a browser-based software and permitted calculation of gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and respiration (R) in the lake. The dissolved O-2 concentration showed a consistent pattern of diel variations that reached up to 0.5 mg L-1 during the warmer summer period (July-August). Towards the end of August these variations decreased in magnitude and remained at similar to 0.1 mg L-1 throughout September. pH showed diel variations that mimicked those of dissolved O-2, with maximum daily variations of 0.4-0.5 pH units during July and August. A seven-day moving average of GPP showed a peak during July to mid-August, and the maximum GPP value of 0.55 mg O-2 L-1 day(-1) is similar to those found in natural oligotrophic lakes. A phytoplankton sample showed a total biomass concentration of 24 mu g L-1, with the species Chrysophyceae, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta occurring in the water. Diel oxygen data indicated that respiration by autotrophs and respiration of autochthonous labile organic matter by heterotrophs dominated in the lake, as is often the case in lakes where planktonic primary production is the main supplier of labile organic carbon. A close coupling between R and GPP suggests that nearly all GPP was respired in the epilimnion. The study shows that the diel oxygen technique can be used for real-time monitoring of seasonal and diurnal variations of dissolved oxygen and pH in pit lakes. This would be a useful technique in pit lake remediation projects where fertilization is used to stimulate algal growth and metal sequestering by algae.																			0883-2927	1872-9134				AUG	2023	155								105725	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105725	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2023.105725		JUN 2023											WOS:001057830300001

These species are not yet included in red lists of protection by law, such as annelids in alpine habitats. Within this context, we studied the annelid fauna in 20 sites located between 1223 and 2703 m asl, belonging to different habitat types (kryal, glacio-rhithral, non glacial streams, springs, littoral lake zone), in three glaciated catchments of the Italian Alps (Noce Bianco, Careser and Conca-Care Alto; Trentino Province). The aim of this study was to describe the annelid communities of the different habitat types collected with different sampling methods (kick sampling and drift) and investigate the relationships between species richness and abundance with altitude. Between the years 2000 and 2005, we collected 4,765 individuals in 418 samples. One genus of Polychaeta (Aeolosoma) and 36 species of Oligochaeta were identified, distributed in four families: Enchytraeidae (28), Lumbriculidae (4), Naididae (3 and Tubificinae juveniles) and Haplotaxidae (1). Five species were new to Italy: Cernosvitoviella carpatica, Cernosvitoviella cf. crassoductus, Henlea brucei, Henlea glandulifera and Mesenchytraeus sanguineus. As expected, Enchytraeidae prevailed in all sites with the genera Cernosvitoviella and Cognettia the most abundant and frequent. The regression and cluster analyses and the generalized linear mixed models we performed, highlighted that the differences in species richness and abundance among sites are explainable partly by altitude but mainly by habitat type. A clear longitudinal species turnover was evident only in the Noce Bianco and Careser glacier-fed streams, where taxonomic diversity (tested by Seriation analysis) and abundance increased with increasing distance from the glacier front and decreasing altitude. Also expected, the harsh kryal habitat was the poorest in species and individuals, with a dominance of semi-aquatic and terrestrial enchytraeid taxa. Drift was found to be more effective than kick sampling in collecting oligochaetes, especially in glacier-fed streams where the use of the pond net is generally hindered by their high and highly variable discharge. In conclusion, this study provides new data on oligochaete fauna in alpine freshwaters, useful to implement the prevision models for Alpine biodiversity up to date not including annelid fauna.

A trench exposure near the eastern end of the fault records two, and possibly three, earthquakes after 3360 +/- 190 cal. yr B.P. and two trenches at the western end of the fault contain evidence for two earthquakes after 19,800 +/- 630 cal. yr B.P., with the most recent earthquake occurring after 1935 +/- 70 cal. yr B.P. The apparent higher frequency of recent earthquakes at the eastern end of the fault may reflect triggered slip on the Olinghouse fault zone due to earthquakes on the conjugate northwest-trending, right-lateral Pyramid Lake fault. Repeated late Pleistocene and Holocene earthquakes on the Olinghouse fault zone demonstrate that northwest-directed, right-lateral shear of the northern Walker Lane is accommodated in part by northeast-trending left-lateral faults.

J	Wolter, PT; Johnston, CA; Niemi, GJ				Wolter, PT; Johnston, CA; Niemi, GJ			Mapping submergent aquatic vegetation in the US Great Lakes using Quickbird satellite data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Submergent aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a powerful indicator of environmental conditions in both marine and fresh water ecosystems. Quickbird imagery was used to map SAV at three sites across the Great Lakes. Unsupervised classifications were performed at each site using summer Quickbird sensor data. At one site, a multi-temporal classification approach was added, combining visible red difference (May-August) with August red and green visible band data. Multi-temporal SAV classification was superior to single-date results at this site. Muck bottom was not seriously confused with SAV, which was unexpected. Multi-temporal classification results showed less confusion between deep water and SAV, although spectral variability due to sub-surface sandbar structure was a source of error in both single- and multi-date classifications. Nevertheless, some of the confounding effects of water column on SAV classification appear to have been mitigated using this multi-temporal approach. Future efforts would be well served by incorporating detailed, continuous, bathymetry data in the classification process. Quickbird sensor data are very useful for classifying SAV under US Great Lakes conditions. However, regional classification efforts using these data may be impractical at this time, as high cost, rigid tasking parameters and unpredictable water conditions limit availability of suitable imagery.

This study at-tempts to reconstruct soil erosion rates (SERs) quantitatively based on lake sediment records from 35 lakes in China. Environmental sequences, e.g., precipitation, vegetation and human activity, were reconstructed and used to identify the dynamic processes of soil erosion based on the General Additive Model (GAM). The findings were as follows. First, drivers of soil erosion in lake basins in different sub-regions of China differed markedly due to the evolution of different monsoon systems and regional environments. Second, influenced by the evolution of different monsoon systems and regional envi-ronments, soil erosion of the Holocene showed different evolutionary processes in China. For example, SERs gradually increased in the northwestern arid zone and remained relatively stable in the monsoon zone until 2.0 ka (1 ka 1/4 1000 calibrated a B.P.). Third, human activity played a more important role in soil erosion in all sub-regions during the Holocene. Human activities through vegetation/land-use change have led to rapid enhancement of soil erosion in the north, south, and southwest China since 2.0 ka, especially in the last 1000 years. This study contributes to our understanding of the evolution of soil erosion under different climate systems in China.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrothermal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in marine and lagoon sediments at the intersection between Tjornes Fracture Zone and recent rift zone (Skjalfandi and Oxarfjordur bays), Iceland	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marine and lagoon sediments, and thermal waters were studied in the northern part of the Icelandic recent rift zone and Tjornes Fracture Zone. All samples analyzed represent slightly altered elastic deposits and hot water discharging from springs and wells. Data obtained show that hydrocarbons are associated mainly with hydrothermal minerals and deep hot thermal ground waters, suggesting that PAH distribution is closely related to the dynamics of hydrothermal environment. Deep emanation of PAHs in present day gas emissions was studied with diatomite absorbent traps. Traps were left exposed at Skogar and Skogalon localities (recent lagoon sediments, Oxarfjorour geothermal field) for 15 and 30 days. Content and distribution of PAHs associations in surface sediments can be used as indicators of hydrocarbon migration and possible zones of hydrocarbon accumulation in land and marine sedimentary basins in active and ancient rift zones of Iceland.

Waterborne pathogens were detected in 96% of samples collected at three Lake Michigan beaches in summer, 2010. Samples were quantified for 22 pathogens in four microbial categories (human viruses, bovine viruses, protozoa, and pathogenic bacteria). All beaches had detections of human and bovine viruses and pathogenic bacteria indicating influence of multiple contamination sources at these beaches. Occurrence ranged from 40 to 87% for human viruses, 65-87% for pathogenic bacteria, and 13-35% for bovine viruses. Enterovirus, adenovirus A, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, bovine polyomavirus, and bovine rotavirus A were present most frequently. Variables selected in multiple regression models used to explore environmental factors that influence pathogens included wave direction, cloud cover, currents, and water temperature. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment was done for C. jejuni, Salmonella spp., and enteroviruses to estimate risk of infection and illness. Median infection risks for one-time swimming events were approximately 3 x 10(-5), 7 x 10(-9), and 3 x 10(-7) for C. jejuni, Salmonella spp., and enteroviruses, respectively. Results highlight the importance of investigating multiple pathogens within multiple categories to avoid underestimating the prevalence and risk of waterborne pathogens.

J	Tang, J; Han, YL; Zha, Y; Li, XD				Tang, Jie; Han, Yalin; Zha, Yan; Li, Xuede			Distribution, seasonal characteristics, ecological risks and human health risks of 9 antibiotics in the main water environment of Anhui province, China	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												This study was performed to determine the status and ecological risk as well as provide a basis for the prevention and control of antibiotic contamination in the drinking water sources of Anhui Province. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC-MS/MS) was used to measure the detection rate and concentrations of nine antibiotics, classified as sulfonamides (SAs) or tetracyclines (TCs), in water collected from 51 sampling points and from areas with different seasonal characteristics. The risks of the main antibiotics (Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), Doxycycline (DOC), Sulfadiazine (SDZ), Sulfamerazine (SM2), Sulfadimethoxine (SDM), Doxycycline (DOC), Tetracycline (TC), Oxytetracyline (OTC), and Chlortetracycline (CTC). to the ecosystem and human beings were evaluated using risk quotients (RQs) and target hazard quotients (THQs), respectively. Nine antibiotics were detected in tap water and surface water at concentrations ranging from 1.71 ng L-1-21.92 ng L-1 and 1.54 ng L-1-78.74 ng L-1, respectively. SMZ and DOC were detected in both tap water and surface water. Their highest detection rates in tap water were 59.1% and 63.6%, respectively, and those in surface water were 81.25% and 43.8%, respectively. SDZ, SMZ, SM2, SDM, DOC, TC, OTC, and CTC were detected in the dry and flood seasons, with levels ranging from 2.43 ng L-1-49.43 ng L-1. Among the detected target antibiotics, SMZ, SM2, TC, OTC, and CTC had higher detection rates. The total concentrations of detected antibiotics were higher in fall than in the other seasons. TC and OTC present in different water sources posed a moderate risk. SDZ present in surface water posed a higher ecological risk than that present in tap water and ground water. Meanwhile, the presence of DOC in tap water and the low risk caused by SDM in surface waters should be emphasized.

Historical records indicate that large variations of the lake area have occurred naturally (0% to >150% of present) but contemporary touristic uses of the lake require a largely constant water level. This dependence increases the regional economic vulnerability. Water balance of the lake as influenced by weather conditions was studied in detail. 79% of water input was due to precipitation, whereas more than 90% of water output was caused by evapotranspiration. Long-term observation of annual and seasonal precipitation sums, starting in 1865, revealed a slow downward trend of 15 years moving averages by 6 +/- 1 mm/decade, masked by large interannual variations of the original data (s.d.: +/- 120 mm). Multidecadal oscillation indices (AMO, NAO, MOI) were tested against patterns of precipitation, air temperature and hydrological parameters of Lake Neusiedl. The clearest relation was observed between air temperature and North Atlantic oscillation index (p < 0.0001). Water level and volume of Lake Neusiedl are very sensitive to precipitation changes with after effects of individual years lasting up to 2 years. Summer precipitation is more important for lake water amount than the other seasons. The major surface water input to Lake Neusiedl is coming from River Wulka. Its annual discharge (15 years moving averages) showed a variable, moderately decreasing trend for the period 1961-2010 by -1.2 +/- 0.6 x 10(6) m(3)/decade. Waste water treatment plants contributed up to 68% of monthly flow of River Wulka into the lake. Precipitation of the current and the previous year, and in some months also temperature influenced Wulka's flow significantly. Evaporative losses from the lake and its reed belt were shown to increase over the last 33 years (+48 +/- 11 mm/decade); as main drivers decreasing relative air humidity and increasing water temperature were identified. Based on the outputs of a regional climate model scenario and seasonal regression models, water balance projections for the period 2035-2065 showed a significant risk of hydrological deficits, leading to lower water levels than at present.

Fluorine in Surface and Subsoil Waters in the Middle Klyaz'ma Basin	WATER RESOURCES												Data on fluorine concentration in water in the Middle Klyaz'ma Basin during summer low-water period have been obtained. Fluorine background concentration has been determined in streams (Klyaz'ma R., small rivers, and creeks), water bodies (drainage ditches, lakes), and subsoil waters. Anthropogenic fluorine hydrochemical anomalies have been determined and localized with respect to urbanized industrial areas. An assumption has been made and experimentally substantiated, according to which fluorine concentration in subsoil water is governed by the processes of its distribution between water and host rocks. It has been established that the interaction of soils with snowmelt water and alluvial deposits with river water in neutral and acid media is accompanied by fluorine removal from solution, while in a weakly alkaline medium, fluorine passes from solid phase into solution. The effect of dissolved organic matter on the process of fluorine leaching from rock minerals also depends, primarily, on the equilibrium pH value: in weakly alkaline media, the presence of organic acids contributes to fluorine mobilization, while in weakly acid media, it reduces mobilization rate.

Although MCs have been detected in individual fresh waters in China, little is known about their occurrence over a large geographic scale. An investigation of 30 subtropical lakes in eastern China was performed during summer 2018 to determine the MCs concentrations in water and their possible risk via direct water consumption to humans, and to assess the associated environmental factors. MCs were detected in 28 of 30 lakes, and the highest mean MCs concentrations occurred in Lake Chaohu (26.7 mu g/L), followed by Lake Taihu (3.11 mu g/L). MC-LR was the primary variant observed in our study, and MCs were mainly produced byMicrocystis,Anabaena(Dolicospermum), andOscillatoriain these lakes. Replete nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, irradiance, and stable water column conditions were critical for dominance of MC-producing cyanobacteria and high MCs production in our study. Hazard quotients indicated that human health risk of MCs in most lakes was at moderate or low levels except Lakes Chaohu and Taihu. Nutrient control management is recommended to decrease the likelihood of high MCs production. Finally, we recommend the regional scale thresholds of total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations of 1.19 mg/L and 7.14 x 10(-2) mg/L, respectively, based on the drinking water guideline of MC-LR (1 mu g/L) recommended by World Health Organization. These targets for nutrient control will aid water quality managers to reduce human health risks created by exposure to MCs.					; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	, Zou/0000-0001-9697-5168; Wan, Xiang/0000-0001-9461-4975; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2020	27	36					45095	45107		10.1007/s11356-020-10384-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10384-0		AUG 2020						32779064					WOS:000558147800001

Local successional changes started with an oxbow lake (160 cal BC) which has later terrestrialised (630 cal AD). Then it changed from a typical alluvial fen into a Sphagnum- dominated spring mire (950 cal AD) supplied by water arising from a river terrace surrounding the locality from three sites. In the centre of this wetland a small patch of alder carr developed (100 cal. AD), showing some tendency towards cyclic succession. The alder carr alternated several times with an open Carer fen (1100 cal AD to recent). The last fen-to-alder carr transition has been documented by direct observation during this century. Possible autogenic and allogenic factors driving the succession are discussed. The model of autogenic cyclic succession corresponds well with direct field observations and can be used to interpret alder carr structure, its dynamics, and function.

Global climate disruption and regional climate shelters after the Toba supereruption	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The Toba eruption similar to 74,000 y ago was the largest volcanic eruption since the start of the Pleistocene and represents an important test case for understanding the effects of large explosive eruptions on climate and ecosystems. However, the magnitude and repercussions of climatic changes driven by the eruption are strongly debated. High-resolution paleoclimate and archaeological records from Africa find little evidence for the disruption of climate or human activity in the wake of the eruption in contrast with a controversial link with a bottleneck in human evolution and climate model simulations predicting strong volcanic cooling for up to a decade after a Toba-scale eruption. Here, we use a large ensemble of high-resolution Community Earth System Model (CESM1.3) simulations to reconcile climate model predictions with paleoclimate records, accounting for uncertainties in the magnitude of Toba sulfur emissions with high and low emission scenarios. We find a near-zero probability of annual mean surface temperature anomalies exceeding 4 degrees C in most of Africa in contrast with near 100% probabilities of cooling this severe in Asia and North America for the high sulfur emission case. The likelihood of strong decreases in precipitation is low in most of Africa. Therefore, even Toba sulfur release at the upper range of plausible estimates remains consistent with the muted response in Africa indicated by paleoclimate proxies. Our results provide a probabilistic view of the uneven patterns of volcanic climate disruption during a crucial interval in human evolution, with implications for understanding the range of environmental impacts from past and future supereruptions.					; Schmidt, Anja/ABD-7113-2021; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/L-2313-2014; Marsh, Daniel/A-8406-2008	Schmidt, Anja/0000-0001-8759-2843; Lamarque, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-4225-5074; Marsh, Daniel/0000-0001-6699-494X													0027-8424	1091-6490				JUL 20	2021	118	29							e2013046118	10.1073/pnas.2013046118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2013046118								34230096					WOS:000685038100010

Previous manipulative experiments have faced challenges controlling environmental conditions, replicating sediment mixing dynamics, and extrapolating across spatial scales. Here we describe a new approach to manipulate lake sediments that overcomes previous concerns about reproducibility and environment controls, whilst also bridging the gap between smaller microcosm or litterbag experiments and whole-ecosystem manipulations. Our approach involves submerging moderate-sized (similar to 15 L) artificial substrates that have been standardised to mimic natural sediments within the littoral zones of lakes. We show that this approach can accurately mirror the absolute dissolved organic carbon concentrations and pH of pore water, and to a lesser degree inorganic carbon concentrations, from natural lake sediments with similar organic matter profiles. On a relative basis, all measured variables had similar temporal dynamics between artificial and adjacent natural sediments. Late-summer zooplankton biomass also did not differ between natural and artificial sediments. By offering a more realistic way to manipulate freshwater sediments than previously possible, our approach can improve predictions of lake ecosystems in a changing world.					; Y, Kurt/KYQ-0933-2024; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012; Basiliko, Nathan/IQX-1238-2023	Emilson, Erik/0000-0002-1516-9728; Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781; Basiliko, Nathan/0000-0001-8512-9484; Yakimovich, Kurt/0000-0001-7033-7977; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	2					431	+		10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1588	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1588													WOS:000408234800018

Neoproterozoic granulites from the northeastern margin of the Tarim Craton: Petrology, zircon U-Pb ages and implications for the Rodinia assembly	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												We report the discovery of a suite of Neoproterozoic granulite facies rocks from the vicinity of the Boston Lake area at the northeastern margin of the Tarim Craton. Mineral parageneses show that these rocks witnessed peak granulite facies metamorphism followed by retrograde amphibolite facies overprinting. Pressure-temperature computations of the Grt-Opx granulites yield ca. 810 degrees C and 1.0 GPa, falling in the lower domain of high-pressure granulite-facies P-T field. Most of the zircons in our samples display core-rim textures with metamorphic overgrowths on detrital cores. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating on the zircon cores yields three major age populations at ca. 0.9-1.0 Ga, 1.8-2.0 Ga and 2.4-2.6 Ga, suggesting the composite sources for the protolith sedimentary rocks. The metamorphic zircons from different samples record a narrow age range between 790 and 820 Ma, marking the timing of high grade metamorphism. This is the first report of Neoproterozoic high-grade metamorphic event from the northeastern margin of the Tarim Craton. Our results could suggest either a major collisional event associated with the assembly of the Tarim Craton within the supercontinent Rodinia, or an Andean-type orogeny at the periphery of the Rodinia supercontinent.

Biomorphology and rhythm of seasonal development of the relic species Lobelia dortmanna in oligotrophic lakes of Tver region	REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS												This article covers the morphology of the vegetative and generative sphere of a rare relic species, Lobelia dortmanna L. (Lobelioideae). This is the first time that using the modular approach a study has analysed the shoot system of this species and described the structures of all three categories: elementary (EM), universal (UM) and basic (OM). This paper describes the life form and analyses the rhythm of seasonal development of the species in the lakes of Tver oblast, and provides data on the seed productivity. As a life form, L. dortmanna is a herbaceous polycarpic, unclearly polycentric shallow-rooted plant with a fibrous root system and non-specialized morphological disintegration. The sympodially growing shoot-system of the plant is formed by two types of different-aged anisotropic replacement shoots: dicyclic vegetative-generative semirosette and annual vegetative rosette shoots. The indicator of actual seed productivity equals on average up to 1621 +/- 451 seeds per single vegetative-generative shoot. The module structure of L. dortmanna is presented by 10 variants of elementary modules. The main modules are formed on the basis of a monocarpic dicyclic anisotropic monopodial shoot with the following morpho-functional zones distinguished: 1) the lower zone of inhibition; 2) the recovery zone; 3) the upper zone of inhibition 4) the latent generative zone; 5) the main inflorescence. The functional role of the first three morpho-functional zones of a monocarpic shoot is performed by a minimum number of variants of elementary modules. In the rhythm of seasonal development, the authors distinguished 7 consecutive stages: 1) the period of relative rest; 2) vegetative phase; 3) the phase of budding; 4) flowering; 5) fruiting; 6) secondary activities. By the character of rhythm of seasonal development, L. dortmanna belongs to the group of evergreen plants with a long growing season and middle-late summer flowering.					, Evgeny/Q-6689-2016; Lapirov, Alexander/Q-6257-2016; Belyakov, Evgeny/Q-6689-2016; Lebedeva, Olga/R-5153-2016	, Evgeny/0000-0001-8465-9037; 													2519-8521	2520-2588					2017	8	3					349	355		10.15421/021754	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/021754													WOS:000416990600006

Fish species composition, distribution and abundance trends in the open-coastal waters of northeastern Lake Ontario, 1992-2012	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Bottom set gill nets were used to describe and track the fish community in northeastern Lake Ontario from 1992-2012. Six fixed, depth-stratified transects, spread more or less evenly from the mouth of the St. Lawrence River in the Kingston Basin to Brighton in central Lake Ontario, were sampled annually during summer. The balanced sampling design provided a broad picture of the warm, cool and coldwater fish community inhabiting open-coastal waters out to about 30m water depth. Catch results were summarized by geographic area and depth strata to describe species distribution patterns, and presented graphically to illustrate annual abundance trends of the most important fish species (Alewife, Lake Trout, Yellow Perch, Walleye, Round Goby, Lake Whitefish, Brown Trout, Rock Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Chinook Salmon, Burbot, Cisco and Round Whitefish). Many of these dominant species showed peak abundance levels in the early 1990 s followed by decline. Of particular note, members of the coldwater benthic-oriented species assemblage, having all declined dramatically in the 1990s, remain at very low abundance levels, and their future prognosis appears bleak.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2015	18	1					89	100		10.1080/14634988.2014.936804	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2014.936804													WOS:000351695400009

Revised chronology for late Pleistocene Mono Lake sediments based on paleointensity correlation to the global reference curve	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Lakes are highly sensitive recorders of climate processes, but are extremely difficult to correlate precisely to ice-core and marine records, especially in the absence of reliable radiocarbon dates. Relative paleointensity (RPI) of Earth's magnetic field is an independent method of correlating high-resolution climate records, and can be applied to both marine and terrestrial sediments, as well as (inversely) correlated to the cosmogenic nuclide records preserved in ice cores. Here we present the correlation of an RPI record from Mono Lake, California to GLOPIS, the Global PaleoIntensity Stack, which increases the age estimation of the basal Mono Lake sediments by > 20000 yr (20 kyr), from similar to 40 ka (kyr before present) to 67 ka. The Mono Lake sediments thus preserve paleoclimatic records of most of the last glacial period, from 67 to 14 ka. In addition, the paleointensity-based age of 40 ka for the geomagnetic excursion preserved at Mono Lake indicates that this is a record of the global Laschamp excursion. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To understand their ecological dynamics, it is essential to know their responses to environmental variation. The finding that E. graciloides exhibits diapause in winter, whereas E. gracilis reproduces throughout the year indicates that the two species might differ in their temperature responses. We measured embryonic and naupliar development times, clutch size (number of eggs per sac), hatching percentage and body length of the first copepodid stage (CI) of both species under non-limiting food conditions at different temperatures. Special attention was given to individual variability on development times and to the use of the gamma density function (GDF) for fitting the probability of moulting. Results show that E. gracilis exhibits just slightly faster development times, lower individual variability, higher hatching percentage and larger clutches than E. graciloides and that extreme temperatures affected E. gracilis less intensely than E. graciloides. GDF was a good tool for estimating individual variability in the different experiments.

Recent Seasonal Dynamics of the Flux of Charcoal Particles in the Sediments of Shira Lake (Southern Siberia) Estimated by Sedimentation Traps	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												Forest and steppe fires pose a threat to natural ecosystems and significantly worsen the living conditions of people living in the surrounding areas. Charcoal particles released into the atmosphere during fires are stored in lake sediments and used in paleo-limnological reconstructions as a proxy for the intensity and frequency of fires. Direct observations of the formation of recent lake sediments are quite rare, despite being quite necessary for adequate interpretation of ancient layers of bottom sediments. Using cylindrical traps incubated at the bottom of Shira Lake (South Siberia, Khakassia) from 2012 to 2019, the seasonal dynamics of the sedimentation flow of charcoal particles >100 mu m into the bottom sediments of the lake was estimated for the first time. It has been shown that the charcoal flux increases annually from October to May, which is explained by burning of fuel by the inhabitants of the surrounding villages during the cold season and by steppe fires occurring in April-May. In summer, the flow decreases significantly; therefore, campfires made by vacationers are a less significant source of coal particles entering the lake. We show a significant anthropogenic contribution to the sedimentation flow of charcoal particles, both from burning fuel and from fires. The value of the annual flux of charcoal particles into traps is similar to the value estimated for recent sediments of other lakes in the world. Our data will be useful for more accurate reconstruction of the dynamics of fires in southern Siberia in the Late Holocene.

J	TARABAY, AB; VILLELA, RG; ESPINO, GD				TARABAY, AB; VILLELA, RG; ESPINO, GD			LIMNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF A HIGH-MOUNTAIN LAKE IN MEXICO	HYDROBIOLOGIA												El Sol is a high-mountain crater lake situated in the caldera of Nevado de Toluca Volcano, Mexico. The climatic conditions at El Sol are intermediate between those of high plains (paramo) and arid tablelands (puna). The volcanic environment of the lake basin, its small drainage area and the high percentage oxygen saturation favor the maintenance of highly transparent water. A combination of tropical conditions with high altitude produce thermal characteristics intermediate between temperate and tropical lakes. Of these characteristics, a low average temperature is outstanding, despite the large solar radiation input to the system. Freezing frequency is intermediate between the annual freezing of temperate lakes at high latitudes and the sporadic freezing of equatorial high-mountain lakes. The radiation income is favored by water transparency and generates persistent masses of hot water in the lake's deepest parts whose temperatures differ up to 2.5-degrees-C from those at higher levels. Rain is the principal contributor of solids to the lake through erosion of the crater walls. The drop in temperature during winter produces an important supply of ammonia from decaying organisms. The relationship N:P < 16 shows N to be limiting a primary productivity which is mainly due to benthic algae. The peak in phytoplankton chlorophyll coincides with the nutrients maximum in August, the middle of the rainy season. El Sol has various characteristics in common with other high-mountain lakes, such as polymictic, oligotrophic, soft waters susceptible to acidification. A diverse algal community, composed of desmids (Closterium, Desmidium, Pleurotaenium, Euastrum), dinoflagellates (Peridinium), diatoms, and a great number of benthic chlorophytes (Nitella, Oedogonium, Zygnema), was found throughout a euphotic zone which reaches the bottom at 14-15 m.					de la Lanza-Espino, G./AGG-8709-2022	BANDERAS TARABAY, ALFONSO GUILLERMO/0000-0001-7824-6519													0018-8158					OCT 11	1991	224	1					1	10		10.1007/BF00006360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006360													WOS:A1991GR16800001
J	BEGIN, Y; PAYETTE, S				BEGIN, Y; PAYETTE, S			POPULATION-STRUCTURE OF LAKESHORE WILLOWS AND ICE-PUSH EVENTS IN SUB-ARCTIC QUEBEC, CANADA	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												The effects of ice-push on shoreline population age structure of Salix planifolia was investigated at Clearwater Lake, a large lake (1270 km2) located in the eastern Canadian subarctic. Twenty-three willow stands located along a gradient of exposure to ice features were studied along the shoreline of a large island. Stand characteristics are significantly correlated with the degree of shore exposure. Drift-ice action maintains continuously vegetation free substrata furthering willow colonization in shoreline habitat. Well-rooted shrubs withstand disturbance through vegetative regenetation, that is profuse basal sprouting in response to ice-scouring and breakage of stems. Age structure of basal shoots is highly correlated with ice-scar dates. The rapid turnover of stem metapopulations frequently damaged by ice allows the shrubs to live older than usually. During recent decades, drift-ice activity contributed to maintain a fast changing shore zone, favourable for the development of shrub populations. High frequency and magnitude of ice-push events were caused by periodic high spring water levels.																			0105-9327					JAN	1991	14	1					9	17																WOS:A1991FB36700002

Myriapod divergence times differ between molecular clock and fossil evidence: U/Pb zircon ages of the earliest fossil millipede-bearing sediments and their significance	HISTORICAL BIOLOGY												Molecular clock calculations suggest a late Cambrian (similar to 500 Ma) divergence of myriapod classes. Yet, the earliest myriapods only appear in the latest Silurian (similar to 425 Ma). 75 million years later; though correlation with the standard marine-based geological time scale is difficult. We radiometrically dated (U/Pb method) zircons in sediments at 3 sites in the UK associated with the supposed earliest millipedes. Kerrera, with only extinct kampecarid myriapods from temporary playa lake deposits in a semi-arid intermontane basin is 425 Ma old. Ludlow, with kampecarid myriapods and the first trigonotarbid arachnids (with book lungs), from transported material in ripple troughs at the base of a semi-arid delta complex, is 420 Ma. Cowie, with the supposed earliest air-breathing millipede (with spiracles), from a temporary playa lake in an intermontane basin complex, is 414 Ma old. The more diverse land arthropod fauna of the Rhynie Chert hot spring deposit, also in an intermontane basin, is 407 Ma old. A rapid radiative evolution from simple intermontane lake margin communities through more evolved lowland communities took only about 20 Ma to reach complex forest grade communities by the Middle Devonian Givetian (about 385 million years).

Outburst flood hazard for glacier-dammed Lac de Rochemelon, France	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Supraglacial Lac de Rochemelon was formed 50 years ago behind an ice dam and grew steadily until 2004. In October 2004, the volume of the lake reached 650 000 m(3), bringing its surface within 0.2 m of the top of the ice dam. To eliminate the threat to towns located below in the event of an overflow, the lake was drained artificially in October 2004 and during the summer of 2005. Once the volume had been reduced to 250 000 m(3) by siphoning, a channel was dug with explosives and the remaining water overflowed naturally. This offered a very good opportunity to investigate the breaching of an ice dam accompanied by thermal erosion of the drainage channel. Extensive field measurements were carried out during drainage. Analysis of the energy dissipated in the channel reveals that only half of the available energy was used for breach erosion. A numerical model was used to simulate the evolution of a number of variables during drainage and to study the sensitivity of discharge and ice erosion to different parameters, revealing a high sensitivity to water temperature. Model simulations indicate that natural drainage of this lake at the beginning of October 2004 would have led to a peak discharge of <6 m(3) s(-1).					; Auclair, Samuel/AAJ-6479-2020	Auclair, Samuel/0000-0003-3490-668X; 													0022-1430	1727-5652					2010	56	195					91	100		10.3189/002214310791190857	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/002214310791190857													WOS:000281257600010

To investigate the occurrence of heavy metals in marine fish species from the South China Sea, 14 fish species were collected along the coastline of Hainan China during the spring of 2012 and examined for species- and tissue-specific accumulation. The median concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb and As in muscle tissue of the examined fish species were not detectable (ND), 2.02, 0.24, 2.64, 0.025, and 1.13 mg kg(-1) wet weight, respectively. Levels of Cu, Zn, Cd and Cr were found to be higher in the liver and gills than in muscle, while Pb was preferentially accumulated in the gills. Differing from other heavy metals, As did not exhibit tissue-specific accumulation. Inter-species differences of heavy metal accumulation were attributed to the different habitat and diet characteristics of marine fish. Human dietary exposure assessment suggested that the amounts of both Cr and As in marine wild fish collected from the sites around Hainan, China were not compliant with the safety standard of less than 79.2 g d(-1) for wild marine fish set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. Further research to identify the explicit sources of Cr and As in marine fish from South China Sea should be established.

J	Kantha, LH; Freeth, SJ				Kantha, LH; Freeth, SJ			A numerical simulation of the evolution of temperature and CO2 stratification in Lake Nyos since the 1986 disaster	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												A one-dimensional numerical model has been applied to simulate the evolution of the temperature and CO2 stratification in Lake Nyos since the 31986 disaster. It incorporates a second-moment turbulence closure scheme for mixing and healing and cooling in the upper layers of the lake. The effects of inflowing stream water and input of the CO2, heat, and dissolved solids at the bottom of the lake are taken into account. The model is initialized by conditions observed immediately after the disastrous outgassing event in 1986 and integrated forward for 10 years, forced by seasonally modulated diurnal heating and nocturnal cooling and heavy summer time precipitation at the surface. Four possible conditions are investigated. The first simulation considers the normal seasonal heating/cooling cycle and steady input of heat, dissolved solids, and CO2 at the bottom. It shows that the upper layers of the lake are quite stable under normal seasonal forcing but the bottom layers reach high CO2 concentrations in less than a decade. The second simulation considers a brief introduction at the bottom of the lake of cooler waters that contain less CO2 and temporarily destabilize the bottom layers. The third and fourth simulations consider anomalous surface forcing conditions that can produce anomalous mixed layer deepening during the cooling seasons, capable of releasing the CO2 stored immediately below the normal mixed layer. These results suggest that a destabilization of the bottom layers is more likely to lead to massive and catastrophic degassing. The results also demonstrate the utility of a numerical model in investigations of caldera/crater lakes such as Lake Nyos.

Relative Sampling Efficiency and Movements of Subadult Lake Sturgeon in the Lower Wolf River, Wisconsin	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Understanding sampling efficiency and movements of subadult Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens is necessary to facilitate population rehabilitation and recruitment monitoring in large systems with extensive riverine and lacustrine habitats. We used a variety of sampling methods to capture subadult Lake Sturgeon (i.e., fish between 75 and 130 cm TL that had not reached sexual maturity) and monitored their movements using radio telemetry in the lower Wolf River, a tributary to the Lake Winnebago system in Wisconsin. Our objectives were to determine whether (1) capture efficiency (expressed in terms of sampling time) of subadult Lake Sturgeon using multiple sampling methods was sufficient to justify within-river sampling as part of a basin-wide recruitment survey targeting subadults, (2) linear home ranges varied in relation to season or sex, and (3) subadult Lake Sturgeon remained in the lower Wolf River. From 2013 to 2014, 628 h of combined sampling effort that included gill nets, trotlines, electrofishing, and scuba capture was required to collect 18 subadult sturgeon, which were then implanted with radio transmitters and tracked by boat and plane. Linear home ranges did not differ in relation to sex but did vary among seasons, and the majority of movement occurred in spring. Seven of the 18 (39%) Lake Sturgeon left the river and were not detected in the river again during the study. Between 56% and 70% of subadult fish remaining in the river made definitive movements to, or near, known spawning locations when adult Lake Sturgeon were actively spawning. Our results suggest only a small proportion of subadult Lake Sturgeon in the Lake Winnebago population use the lower Wolf River, indicating that riverine sampling may not always be warranted when targeting subadults in large lake-river complexes. More information is needed on distribution of subadult Lake Sturgeon to develop sampling protocols for this population segment.

Ground-Control Networks for Image Based Surface Reconstruction: An Investigation of Optimum Survey Designs Using UAV Derived Imagery and Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry	REMOTE SENSING												The use of small UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Multi-View Stereopsis (MVS) for acquiring survey datasets is now commonplace, however, aspects of the SfM-MVS workflow require further validation. This work aims to provide guidance for scientists seeking to adopt this aerial survey method by investigating aerial survey data quality in relation to the application of ground control points (GCPs) at a site of undulating topography (Ennerdale, Lake District, UK). Sixteen digital surface models (DSMs) were produced from a UAV survey using a varying number of GCPs (3-101). These DSMs were compared to 530 dGPS spot heights to calculate vertical error. All DSMs produced reasonable surface reconstructions (vertical root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of <0.2 m), however, an improvement in DSM quality was found where four or more GCPs (up to 101 GCPs) were applied, with errors falling to within the suggested point quality range of the survey equipment used for GCP acquisition (e.g., vertical RMSE of <0.09 m). The influence of a poor GCP distribution was also investigated by producing a DSM using an evenly distributed network of GCPs, and comparing it to a DSM produced using a clustered network of GCPs. The results accord with existing findings, where vertical error was found to increase with distance from the GCP cluster. Specifically vertical error and distance to the nearest GCP followed a strong polynomial trend (R-2 = 0.792). These findings contribute to our understanding of the sources of error when conducting a UAV-SfM survey and provide guidance on the collection of GCPs. Evidence-driven UAV-SfM survey designs are essential for practitioners seeking reproducible, high quality topographic datasets for detecting surface change.																			2072-4292					SEP	2016	8	9							786	10.3390/rs8090786	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8090786													WOS:000385488000096
J	HANSEN, AM; JEPPESEN, E				HANSEN, AM; JEPPESEN, E			LIFE-CYCLE OF CYCLOPS-VICINUS IN RELATION TO FOOD AVAILABILITY, PREDATION, DIAPAUSE AND TEMPERATURE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The seasonal cycle of Cyclops vicinus was studied during a 5 year period in the shallow and hypertrophic Lake Sobygard. The annual number of generations varied between three and six and sometimes included midsummer generations. Naupliar and copepodite density was extremely high, the maximum recorded being 1313 and 745 l-1 respectively. The seasonal fluctuation in the abundance of C.vicinus was related to the concentration of edible phytoplankton (EDP): when diatoms and cryptomonads were abundant, nauplii and copepodites were also abundant, whereas when greens such as Scenedesmus spp. were dominant, no cohorts were observed. The maximum density of copepodites in the separate cohorts and the amount of EDP, expressed as carbon content, were found to be significantly correlated. The development of the second cohort also seemed to depend on the occurrence of a peak in rotifer density. High number of eggs per female generally coincided with high biovolume of EDP, suggesting that algae constituted a major part of the diet of adult C. vicinus. The duration of the naupliar stage was inversely related to temperature and is one of the shortest times that have been recorded in the literature. The short duration is probably attributable to the abundance of food. Fish composition and the calculated sex ratio of C. vicinus indicate low predation pressure from planktivorous fish. The high density of C. vicinus during the summer, when the whole population would be expected to have entered diapause, is probably attributable to the concurrence of low predation and the abundance of food.

Advances and challenges in modelling the impacts of invasive alien species on aquatic ecosystems	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive alien species (IAS) have become an important driver of biodiversity change and exert severe pressure on natural ecosystems. The development of modelling approaches to assess and predict their distributions and impacts, and evaluate management options has increased substantially. We reviewed these modelling approaches, applied in aquatic ecosystems, using a systematic review approach in line with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. According to our results, multispecies/ecosystem models dominated the applications, with dynamic and non-spatial models being the most prevalent. Most of the models included an additional stressor, mainly fisheries, climate change or nutrient loading. The impacts on biota focused on predation, but also on competition and ecosystem functioning, while the impacts on ecosystem services focused on food provision and water purification. At species/population level, most of the studies reported negative impacts; while at multispecies/ecosystem level, negative and both negative and positive impacts were similarly represented. We reflect on the ability of current models to assess different impacts of IAS populations and highlight the need to advance their capabilities to predict future impacts. Further development of models that allow capturing the arrival, establishment and spread of IAS and assess their impacts in an integrated way is still needed. Spatial-temporal modelling techniques bridging with novel analytical capabilities (such as environmental DNA to investigate the presence of IAS and metabarcoding and machine learning to predict future trophic behavior and distributions) may be the key for future achievement.

A high-resolution sediment core recovered from the Yileimu Lake revealed 11 potential paleoearthquakes around the Fuyun fault in northern Xinjiang. Among them, three events recorded by ductile deformation and turbidites or coseismic subsidence were possibly correlated with M-s >= 7.0 earthquakes, and the others characterized by turbidites or coarse deposits were likely related to M-s >= 5.8 or M-s >= 5.5 earthquakes. Shaking intensities of 8.60 and 5.51 MMI were required to cause extensive landslides and turbidites, respectively; while 6.89, 6.35 and 5.34 MMI were likely to be required to cause coseismic subsidence, ductile deformation and coarse deposits related to landscape shattering in the catchment area, respectively. Absolute radiocarbon dating and historical earthquake-event markers disclosed a recurrence interval of 20-60 years form M-s >= 5.5 earthquakes, and a potential interval of 100 years for M-s >= 7.0 earthquakes during the last 450 years. A seismic quiescence of 89 years since the 1931/08/11 M(s)8.0 Fuyun earthquake might have significantly increased the potential of a strong earthquake related to the fault in the near future.					zhang, siqi/KWU-0918-2024; Guo, Qiaoqiao/HKW-5407-2023; Jiang, Hanchao/ABG-2653-2020; Huang, Shuaitang/NHP-5506-2025; Xu, Hongyan/I-4518-2017	Fan, Jiawei/0000-0002-8565-5094; Jiang, Hanchao/0000-0003-3391-4477; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				AUG 30	2020	558						75	88		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.08.051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.08.051													WOS:000579842700009

Decreases in diatom cell size during the 20th century in the Laurentian Great Lakes: a response to warming waters?	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Several authors have postulated that lake warming favors diatom taxa characterized by smaller cell sizes and suggested that this phenomenon may affect freshwater phytoplankton communities worldwide. Here, we examined historical (similar to 1900-2015) trends in diatom cell size in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Cell size decreased in Lakes Superior, Erie and Ontario, while no significant trends were observed for Michigan and Huron. In Lakes Superior and Ontario, cell size within species decreased over the course of the 20th century, suggesting demographic shifts toward smaller, later-generation individuals. Contrastingly, species-specific mean cell size increased in Michigan and Erie, likely as a result of accelerated loss rates during summer stratification. Size-specific rates of relative abundance change (larger taxa decreased while smaller taxa increased), were observed in all lakes except Michigan. These shifts toward communities dominated by smaller celled taxa either reinforced (Superior, Huron, Ontario) or dampened (Michigan, Erie) the influence of demographic shifts. Notwithstanding the influences of multiple stressors on diatom cell size at the within-lake scale, we demonstrated a gradual (5.11 mu m(3)/y) decline in mean diatom cell size across the basin. Historical, basin-wide decreases in cell size demonstrate the likelihood of climate change driving changes in the primary producer community of large, freshwater systems.

To dilute eutrophic water in Lake Barato, Japan, an Inlet Project was carried out during the summer of 2005 via a 1 m(3)/sec inlet. River water was discharged from the margin of the upper basin of the lake to dilute the water. We undertook a numerical simulation of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) distribution considering five inlet cases by using Princeton Ocean Model (POM). Total N and TP concentrations of inlet water were TN:1.3 mg/l and TP:0.08 mg/l. Model results suggest the most effective and feasible way to achieve dilution is via a 5 m(3)/sec inlet (78% related to the total volume in the lake) and opening the Shinko Gate, connecting the lake with Ishikari Bay. Following this scheme, TN and TP concentrations would be reduced by 28% following 30 days of discharge according to the simulation results.																			1040-2381						2008	24	4					301	312		10.1080/07438140809354840	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354840													WOS:000269666900001

No cyclicity was recorded in the numbers of the dominating species, that is, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis). Fallowing of the arable land resulted in a decline in diversity and species richness of small mammals in the habitat mosaic under study. The greatest changes were recorded in the community inhabiting a narrow belt of spatially heterogeneous alderwood along the lakeshore. In this community, a considerable increase in the number of yellow-necked mice and a general increase in the dominance of forest species took place. We suggest that the fallowing of extensive arable lands, taking place in Poland for the last two decades, constitute an attractive source of food for small mammals and may lead to a considerable decline in small mammal species diversity within the landscape or even cause local extinctions in some species.																			0003-455X	1797-2450				AUG	2008	45	4					263	269		10.5735/086.045.0404	http://dx.doi.org/10.5735/086.045.0404													WOS:000259566100005

The epiphytic flora of every macrophyte species examined contained active diazotrophs capable of reducing acetylene at rates of up to 41 682 nM g-1 h-1 during midday incubations. The general diel nitrogenase activity (NA) pattern shared by Heteranthera dubia (Jacq.) MacM., Najas guadalupensis (Spreng.) Morong and Lemna minor L. was unimodal and reproducible throughout the summer: ethylene evolution was low in the morning, peaked around midday (11.00-14.00 h), then declined to a nocturnal minimum. Peaks in NA were generally coincident with light intensity maxima. However, rates of ethylene evolutin by the Myriophyllum spicatum L. epiphytes studied had low NA which exhibited an atypical diel pattern. Epiphyte nocturnal NA ranged from 5 to 46% of a day''s total activity. Dark (foil-wrapped) bottle NA was constant on a diel basis and was not dependent on preceding light history.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				AUG	1987	28	3-4					341	352		10.1016/0304-3770(87)90010-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(87)90010-6													WOS:A1987J832600010
J	Park, O				Park, O			Studies in nocturnal ecology, VII. Preliminary observations on Panama rain forest animals	ECOLOGY												Data were collected, chiefly at the Barro Colorado Island laboratory in Gatun Lake, by 2 general methods 1) The vocalization of typical rain forest animals was charted and physical influences such as light intensity, air temp. and relative humidity were measured at regular intervals. As demonstrated earlier for the beech-maple climax of the N. American temperate area, there was an apparent correlation between the general activity and the operative factor complex. 2) Activity was recorded with kymographs by means of light cages carrying a tambour, and suspended by delicate springs. A variety of rain forest forms were studied, including a nocturnal tarantula (Sericopelma rubronitens), a nocturnal gecko (Thecadactylus rapicaudus), land crabs (Pseudothelphusa richmondi) and 3 spp. of diurnal lizards belonging to the genera Anolis, Mabuya, and Basiliscus. Despite the artificial nature of the recording equipment, the data show a marked specificity of activity rhythm for the spp. studied, and a close correlation with the normal 24-hr. cycle.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				APR	1938	19	2					208	223		10.2307/1929637	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929637													WOS:000200149000004

In Italy this recommendation has given new impetus to the study of diatom communities and the application of biotic indices. During the summer of 2004, a total of 11 rivers of the Trentino province (Northern Italy) were sampled, revealing the presence in low abundances of the diatom Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) M. Schmidt. The sites where this diatom occurred were characterised by a low pollution impact; they were also lake fed or had a regulated flow regime, although with different geologies. Morphological features of D. geminata frustules were analysed using LM and SEM and specimens could be referred to the morphotype "geminata". In many countries this species is expanding its distribution and in New Zealand it is considered an invasive alga. This work provides an initial report on the presence of D. geminata in the Trento province, and contributes to increasing the knowledge on its distribution in Italy and its ecology in the Alps.

In a seasonal study in which variations in the partitioning of Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb (expressed as log K-p values) were correlated with phytoplankton parameters, it appeared that manganese occurred mainly In the particulate form during algal blooms, whereas dissolved manganese predominated during periods low in phytoplankton. Photosynthetic activity (up to 700 mu g C 1(-1) h(-1)) correlated slightly better with the [log K-p]-Mn than the chlorophyll a concentration (up to 140 mu g 1(-1)) and the pH (up to 8.35), suggesting that phytoplankton photosynthesis promotes Mn precipitation in the river. The variability in the partitioning of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in 1990 did not seem to be determined by the seasonal differences in phytoplankton and manganese partitioning, although increased values of [log K-p]-Zn had been indicated for the summer of 1983, when metal concentrations had generally been higher than in 1990. The lack of effect of riverine phytoplankton blooms on partitioning of metals other than Mn contrasts with observations in stagnant waters. However, the low levels of cellular metal observed in cultures, along with the single growth pulse that phytoplankton shows during its short residence in the river, are consistent with the observations.																			0043-1354					MAR	1995	29	3					941	946		10.1016/0043-1354(94)00204-K	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)00204-K													WOS:A1995QG42600020

Fishing for Northern Pike in Minnesota: Comparing Anglers and Dark House Spearers	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												In order to project fishing effort and demand of individuals targeting Northern Pike Esox lucius in Minnesota, it is important to understand the catch orientations, management preferences, and site choice preferences of those individuals. Northern Pike are specifically targeted by about 35% of the approximately 1.5 million licensed anglers in Minnesota and by approximately 14,000-15,000 dark house spearers. Dark house spearing is a traditional method of harvesting fish through the ice in winter. Mail surveys were distributed to three research strata: anglers targeting Northern Pike, dark house spearing license holders spearing Northern Pike, and dark house spearing license holders angling for Northern Pike. Dark house spearers, whether spearing or angling, reported a stronger orientation toward keeping Northern Pike than did anglers. Anglers reported a stronger orientation toward catching large Northern Pike than did dark house spearers when spearing or angling. Northern Pike regulations were the most important attribute affecting site choice for respondents in all three strata. Models for all strata indicated a preference for lakes without protected slot limits. However, protected slot limits had a stronger negative influence on lake preference for dark house spearing licensees (whether spearing or angling) than for anglers.

Analysis of trends in episodic acidification of streams in Western Maryland	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In this study we report on changes in the magnitude and mechanisms of episodic acidification of a small acidsensitive stream in western Maryland (U.S.) during the 1990s, a period in which wet sulfate deposition declined by 10-25% due to implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990. We observed a relatively minor trend in the magnitude of episodic acidification over this period, as measured bytransient changes in acid neutralizing capacity (Delta ANC) and minimum values of ANC (ANC(min)) during 22 events sampled prior to and following CAAA implementation. Any relationship to changes in atmospheric deposition appears to be confounded by large hydroclimatological variability between the two sampling periods. Nonetheless, results obtained prior to implementation of the CAAA indicated that the mechanism of episodic acidification was mostly attributable to flushing of accumulated sulfate from the watershed, whereas results obtained postCAAA indicated domination by base cation dilution. This shift in the mechanism of episodic acidification is qualitatively consistent with hydrochemical theory, as well as with empirical results from surface waters in other regions where dramatic declines in sulfate deposition have taken place.

Timing and site selection of spawning in a landlocked population of rainbow smelt in Wisconsin	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												To study the site selection and timing of spawning by rainbow smelt, Osmerus modax, in a freshwater system, smelt were sampled with fyke nets during the spawning run in spring 2002 and 2003. The sex ratio of smelt favored males in the early and late segments of the run, with over 90% of smelt caught being male. At the peak in the catch, females comprised 57% of the smelt collected. The gonadosomatic index of males and females declined significantly on the day of peak catch, signaling the peak in spawning activity. Higher catches of smelt occurred on cobble-dominated substrates during the peak of the run, but no site selection was apparent earlier or later. Groundwater outflow did not appear to affect catches. Our study suggests that smelt come inshore but do not select specific spawning substrates prior to or after the peak in spawning. Smelt do select cobble sites during the highest rates of spawning. The relation between the peak in spawning and site selection could have application in planning removal strategies for the species.																			0378-1909					AUG	2006	76	2-4					413	418		10.1007/s10641-006-9005-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9005-8													WOS:000240317000026

Our earlier work is oxic seawater showed that the availability of Mo is controlled in part by the ratio of sulfate to molybdenum because sulfate inhibits the assimilation of molybdate. The SO42-:Mo ratio in seawater is very high relative to most freshwater lakes-a finding that is consistent with the scarcity of planktonic, N-fixing cyanobacteria in coastal marine ecosystems. This ratio is constant in seawater, however, limiting a test of our hypothesis in marine systems. These Alberta salt lakes provide a more robust test in saline systems. The ratio of sulfate to molybdenum within any given saline lake was relatively constant over a summer season, but the ratio between lakes varied and ranged from values typical of freshwater lakes to values higher than in seawater. N-fixing cyanobacteria are significant fractions of the plankton in six of the 13 lakes we studied and are rare or absent in the others. The SO42:Mo ratio was strong predictor of the abundance of planktonic, N-fixing cyanobacteria. Sulfate or Mo concentrations alone, however, were not. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis that sulfate can control Mo availability in oxic waters. Phosphorus concentrations, and the ratio of N to P, were not good predictors of the abundance of N-fixing cyanobacteria in these saline lakes, as they often are in freshwater lakes. The differences between predictions from a freshwater, P regression model and actual abundances of N-fixing cyanobacteria in the saline lakes were best explained by the SO42-:Mo ratio.

Long-term herbivore population dynamics in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and its implications for early human impacts	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Large herbivores are keystone species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), but their past population ecology is the product of a complex combination of climatic changes and human activities that span the Holocene. In this study we use the record of dung-residing fungal spores (Sporormiella) in the stratified lake sediments of Genggahai Lake in the northeastern QTP to track changes in large herbivore populations. We hypothesize that the abundance of Sporormiella spores would decrease with the reduction of herbivore populations with the retreat of the summer monsoon after the mid-Holocene and the resulting vegetation degradation which is indicated by the pollen record. However, our results reveal an increase in Sporormiella spores after 5.7 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP), suggesting an increase in herbivore populations. Combined with regional archeological evidence, we infer that hunter-gatherers may have influenced the regional herbivore ecology and that the early Tibetan people may have domesticated or managed yaks and other herbivores in the northeastern QTP since 5.7 ka. The records of Sporormiella spores are interpreted within a robust chrono-stratigraphic framework provided by numerous radiocarbon dates from regional archeological sites, and the representation of Sporormiella spores during the Tang Dynasty is tested by a comparison with historical records of the livestock population of the region. Our findings potentially improve understanding of early human adaptation to environmental changes and past herbivore-steppe ecology in the QTP during the Holocene.

Legacy effects of acidification and climate warming affect recent recovery of diatom assemblages in Sudbury-region lakes (Ontario, Canada)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Smelting activities have strongly affected the Sudbury (Ontario, Canada) region since the late-nineteenth century, leading to acidification and metal contamination of local ecosystems. Regulations restricting acid deposition were enacted in the 1970s, after which many lakes exhibited increasing pH and decreasing metal concentrations. Given the documented chemical recovery and potential emergence of new stressors, we used paleolimnological tools to assess the biological recovery processes in three previously acidified lakes, and also to reconstruct the limnological histories of two reference lakes that were relatively unaffected by acidification. Using subfossil diatoms preserved in lake sediments, we show that assemblages from the acidified lakes have not returned to their pre-disturbance conditions but became dominated by an acidophilous planktonic taxon, Asterionella ralfsii var. americana Korner, during the past few decades. Considering that this taxon has a relatively low pH optimum and is mostly found in thermally stratified waters during summers, we suspect that the legacy effects of acidification and climate warming are the main factors driving its recent prosperity. Our study suggests that biological recovery lags chemical recovery in acid-impacted systems, and a return to pre-disturbance biological assemblages may be impeded by newly emerging environmental stressors.					; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/B-8248-2014; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Cheng, Yuanyu/0000-0002-7607-5514; Keller, Wendel/0000-0002-3607-3098; Paterson, Andrew/0000-0002-4296-9528; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/0000-0002-8208-496X; Michelutti, Neal/0000-0002-5857-4811													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2023	850	9					2101	2114		10.1007/s10750-023-05222-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05222-6		APR 2023											WOS:000972134800001

Differences in spatial communities of European perch (Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758) fry in a canyon-shaped reservoir are not attributable to genetics	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					15th European Congress of Ichthyology	SEP 07-11, 2015	Porto, PORTUGAL	Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res				The question was whether a canyon-shaped reservoir is inhabited by genetically distinct populations of European perch Perca fluviatilis exhibiting different spatial behaviour, or by a single population. The study was conducted in the spring of 2006 at Rimov Reservoir, Czech Republic. Epipelagic and bathypelagic perch fry (EPF and BPF) were captured by trawl net (mesh size 1x1.35mm) controlled by echo sounder, and littoral perch fry and adults (LPF and LPA) were caught by electrofishing and beach seine (mesh size 1x1.35mm). DNA was isolated in 266 individuals from the reservoir, and phylogenetic analysis based on mtDNA was performed (n=18) on BPF, EPF, LPF, and LPA from the reservoir and additional sequences from Central Europe. Six microsatellites were used for differentiating among communities (n=266). There was no evidence for genetic divergence in mtDNA sequences. Analyses of microsatellites revealed no statistically significant variations between spatial communities, and confirmed genetic homogeneity among communities. F-ST values and the number of genetic clusters point to the same conclusion, i.e., the reservoir is inhabited by a single population whose individuals occupy different microhabitats.

Problems arise because of the physiochemical changes of wood occurring in the sedimentation environment. Subfossil wood modification can result from the uptake of mineral and organic substances into the wood tissue. It can also occur as the effect of microbiological degradation of wood. The goal of this study was to identify the appropriate method of subfossil wood preparation for the densitometric research. For this purpose the wood of Norway spruce from Lake Schwarzensee was subjected to extraction in de-ionized water, acetone and diluted acetic acid. The application of acetic acid did not significantly influence the density of the wood and acetone seemed to be too aggressive. The best result was obtained by rinsing the samples in cold de-ionized water. This extraction procedure allowed removal of unwanted water-soluble, organic and inorganic compounds from wood and simultaneously did not lead to the degradation of subfossil samples.					; Kłusek, Marzena/H-3694-2019	Grabner, Michael/0000-0002-5220-721X; Klusek, Marzena/0000-0003-4341-5719													1536-1098	2162-4585				JAN	2016	72	1					23	34		10.3959/1536-1098-72.01.23	http://dx.doi.org/10.3959/1536-1098-72.01.23								27158247					WOS:000377574300003

The lakes are distributed along a latitudinal gradient that includes several ecoclimatic zones. It also spans large gradients in limnological variables. Thus, the study lakes are ideal for environmental calibration of modern diatom assemblages. Canonical correspondence analysis, with forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests, showed that maximum lake depth and summer surface-water temperature were the two environmental variables that accounted for most of the variance in the diatom data. The concentrations of sodium and calcium were also important explanatory variables. Using weighted-averaging regression and calibration techniques, we developed a predictive statistical model to infer lake surface-water temperature, and we evaluated the feasibility of using diatoms as paleoclimate proxies. This model may be used to derive paleotemperature inferences from fossil diatom assemblages at appropriate sites in the western Canadian Arctic.					; Birks, John/C-3103-2008; Birks, H.

Changes in the species composition of the phytoplankton between early May and August followed the general succession pattern outlined for other temperate lakes. Fast-growing, r-strategist cryptophytes, dominant in the early phase of succession, could be separated sufficiently by 12 mu m membrane filters from larger K-strategists like Ceratium hirundinella and Gleootrichia echinulata which dominated in July. Under more turbulent conditions, the biomass of diatoms increased, and these species were also >12 mu m. Growth rates of the phytoplankton and those of the two size groups were sensitive to the species composition, but fitted reasonably to the Droop model. Long turnover times of orthophosphate in the water, the Phosphorus Deficiency Indicator defined here as the ratio of the light-saturated rate of photosynthesis and the conductivity coefficient of phosphate uptake, and relative growth rates generally indicated low P-deficiency. Moderate deficiency was observed in late July, towards the end of the stratification period. Steady-state net P-uptake rates were calculated from the Droop model and compared with instantaneous net P-uptake rates estimated from P-32 uptake kinetics by the linear force-flow relationship of Falkner et al. (Arch. Microbiol., 152, 353-361, 1989). The two data sets showed surprisingly similar seasonal trends. Depletion of epilimnetic soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) resulted in enhanced utilization of intracellularly stored P. Such periods were, however, interrupted by elevated SRP inputs to the epilimnion that led to luxury P uptake and a low incidence of P deficiency.

Evolution of the Indian summer monsoon: synthesis of continental records	MONSOON EVOLUTION AND TECTONICS - CLIMATE LINKAGE IN ASIA	Geological Society Special Publication											Fluvial sediments of the Siwalik succession in the Himalayan Foreland Basin form the most important continental archive for reconstructing monsoonal fluctuations during the Late Miocene to Late Pleistocene. A number of proxy records suggest multiple phases of monsoonal intensification with peaks at 10.5, 5.5 and 3 Ma after which the strength of the monsoon decreased to modern day values with minor fluctuations. Detailed evaluation of Late Quaternary interfluve stratigraphic development in the Ganga plains shows that interfluve areas near the major rivers aggraded periodically between 27 and 90 ka. They subsequently degraded or accumulated sediment only locally, probably reflecting decreased monsoonal precipitation around the Last Glacial Maximum. Increased precipitation during the 15 to 5 ka period of monsoon recovery probably increased discharge and promoted incision and widespread badland formation. In western India, the fluvial records back to c. 128 ka suggest a stronger monsoon around 80 ka followed by periods of weakened monsoon around 70 to 30 ka and progressive desiccation in the glacial period. Holocene lacustrine records from western Rajasthan suggest maximum lake levels at c. 6 ka and complete desiccation between c. 3 and 4 ka.

Some of them, called wet based, contain liquid water capped by a permanent ice cover between 2.5 and 6 in in thickness. The others, called dry based, are ice-block lakes. The thickness of the latter may far exceed those of the former. Their level is rising from freezing of the surface flooding of summer meltwater. However, we show here for the first time, using isotopic analyses together with an ionic and gas content and composition study, that the ice of one of these dry-based lakes has been formed by complete freezing from top to bottom of a closed water reservoir and not by successive layers of icings (aufeis) piling on top of each other. We also show how this lake, dammed by a cold-based glacier. has contributed to the formation of the basal ice layer of this glacier.

J	GELLER, W				GELLER, W			THE TEMPERATURE STRATIFICATION AND RELATED CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILEAN LAKES IN MIDSUMMER	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Temperature profiles in summer (February/March 1990) were measured in 24 lakes along a latitudinal transect from central Chile (32-degrees-S) to Patagonia (47-degrees-S). and on Easter island (27-degrees-S). The lakes of the temperature zone, between 47-degrees-S and 38-degrees-S, are warm monomictic with surface and deep-water temperatures ranging from 12-degrees-C to 21-degrees-C and from 5.5-degrees-C to 10-degrees-C respectively. The heat content per unit area in midsummer was found to vary with lake area. The local stability of stratification (N2) Varied by more than two orders of magnitude, declining with increasing latitude, altitude, and depth. The lakes can be classified according to morphometric and temperature characteristics, mixing depth, stability of stratification and glacial turbidity. Lago General Carrera (463 m) was found to be almost as deep as Lago Nahuel Huapi (464 m), which is considered to be the deepest lake in South America.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					1992	54	1					37	57		10.1007/BF00877263	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877263													WOS:A1992HR19300003

Evidence of repeated long-distance movements by lake charr Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Huron	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Movements and dispersal distances of acoustically-tagged adult lake charr Salvelinus namaycush were estimated based on detections at acoustic receivers in Lake Huron during 2010-2014. Most lake charr were detected only at receivers proximate to their release location or were not detected at all, but 3-9% of tagged lake charr were detected at receivers located over 100 km from their release location. Several fish made extensive repeated migrations within the lake, some at the scale of the entire main basin. Our observations show that some lake charr individuals repeat a similar pattern each year of moving long distances, and some fish were observed to show annual fidelity to presumed foraging sites in the spring at a spatial scale of approximately 200 km. Our telemetry-based estimates were minimum estimates of dispersal, as the placement of receivers within Lake Huron was not optimal for detection of lake charr and did not cover the majority of the lake. Further study of long-distance movement in lake charr is necessary to fully understand the implications of this behavior to lake charr ecology, population dynamics, and management in the Great Lakes.

Pond substrates consisted of either oil sands fine tailings or clay and lean oil sands deposited by the mining operations. Yellow perch were stocked immediately postspawning and subsamples were sacrificed at 5 and 11 months to measure indicators of energy storage and utilization. These indicators included survival, age, spawning periodicity, condition factor, gonad size, fecundity, and liver size. Indicators generally showed patterns consistent with improved energy storage and utilization in the experimental pond yellow perch as compared with yellow perch in the lake from which the stocked fish originated. This was evidenced by increased gonad size, condition factor, and Liver size and the disappearance of spawning periodicity. The patterns observed in experimental ponds suggest improved resource availability and (or) reduced intra- and interspecific competition. Yellow perch physiological indicators were also compared with those measured at several remote natural lakes in the area. Fisheries parameters measured in yellow perch from the experimental ponds generally fell within the range of those found in natural lakes.					van+den+Heuvel, Michael/ABF-1188-2020														0706-652X					JUL	1999	56	7					1213	1225		10.1139/f99-062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f99-062													WOS:000081788400008

Quantitative analysis of temporal variations on shoreline change pattern along Ganjam district, Odisha, east coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This research work describes the shoreline change rate variations of Ganjam district of Odisha, east coast of India for the past 24 years. Seven shorelines were extracted from multidated satellite images, and shoreline change rate has been calculated by using digital shoreline analysis system. Long-term shoreline change rate (1990-2014) of the study area has been calculated using weighted linier regression method. Short-term changes have been computed for different time scales, i.e., 1990-1999, 1999-2006, 2006-2008, 2008-2013 and 2013-2014 using end point rate method. The results obtained from the study show that 71.65 % of Ganjam coast shows accretion pattern and 28.35 % of coast falls under erosion category. High erosion is mainly noticed in northern side of Gopalpur port which is mainly due to recent construction activities. Short-term results reveals that 2006-2008 period shows maximum erosion and 1999-2006 period exhibit maximum accretion in Ganjam coast. From short-term analysis, it is observed that shoreline in the study area shows cyclic nature of erosion and accretion pattern. The study reveals that tropical cyclones and human activities such as port development, construction of breakwaters and groins are the major factors responsible for shoreline erosion in the study area.					; Kankara, R/AAO-9629-2020; K, Senthamil Selvan/NGS-2389-2025	Kankara, R S/0000-0002-9905-0918; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2016	75	10							929	10.1007/s12665-016-5723-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5723-1													WOS:000376589500082

The first record of oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense (De Haan, 1849 [in De Haan, 1833-1850]) (Decapoda: Palaemonidae) in the Ukrainian part of the Danube Delta	BIOINVASIONS RECORDS												The alien shrimp Macrobrachium nipponense (De Haan, 1849 [in De Haan, 1833-1850]), oriental river prawn has been identified in the water bodies of the Ukrainian part of the Danube Delta for the first time. Diagnosis of the species is based on measurements of 35 specimens. Characteristic features: the dorsal side of rostrum armed by 12-13 teeth, with feathery setae between them, 3 (rarely 2) teeth located on the ventral side of rostrum. During 2019-2020, the freshwater shrimp, M nipponense, has become a common element of the benthic fauna of the Kiliva arm of the Danube River. It is supported by regular registrations of numerous shrimp aggregations in different parts of the arm (from the 32nd to the 80th km of the main stream) since the summer of 2019. The record of this alien shrimp species potentially confirms its introduction from other water bodies of the North-Western Black Sea Coastal Area to the Danube Delta by the natural dispersion or the unauthorized introduction. Although the known records suggest an accidental introduction of this species into the area close to the lakes of the Lower Danube area, both hypotheses require further investigation and approbation.

J	Clevering, OA; vanGulik, WMG				Clevering, OA; vanGulik, WMG			Restoration of Scirpus lacustris and Scirpus maritimus stands in a former tidal area	AQUATIC BOTANY												After the damming of estuaries in the Netherlands, Scirpus lacustris L. and Scirpus maritimus L. stands deteriorated due to the reduction of tidal range. Experiments were conducted in the field to investigate the effects of soil fertility, water depth and waterfowl grazing on the establishment of both species in a non-tidal waterbody. Fertilisation using a slow-release fertiliser (pellets of 7.5 g Osmocote per plant, containing 17% N, 1.6% P2O5, and 8.7% K) did not affect dry matter production of either species. Scirpus lacustris became established in both shallow (5-15 cm) and moderately deep (30-40 cm) water, whereas S. maritimus only became well established in shallow water. A high plant density (12 plants m(-2)) had a negative effect on the growth of individual S. lacustris plants at both 5 and 30 cm water depth. Growth of individual plants of S. maritimus was negatively affected by a high plant density (20 plants m(-2)) at 5 cm water depth but not at 30 cm. Support of shoots, by wire-netting, increased total plant dry weight of S. lacustris but not that of S. maritimus. Summer grazing occurred mainly by mute swans (Cygnus olor L.). Grazing during three subsequent growing seasons resulted in the complete disappearance of S. lacustris. In contrast, a 3-year-old S. lacustris stand was able to recover after being grazed several times within 1 year. It was concluded that in former tidal areas Scirpus can be re-established by planting. Waterfowl grazing may, however, seriously limit growth of Scirpus.																			0304-3770					JAN	1997	55	4					229	246		10.1016/S0304-3770(96)01087-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3770(96)01087-X													WOS:A1997WJ24500001

In subsequent years the blooms were successfully eliminated by increasing the molar N:P ratio of added nutrients to 35:1. The nutrient additions also resulted in dramatic increases in both autotrophic (predominantly Synechococcus sp.) and heterotrophic (bacteria) picoplankton numbers, with respective maxima of 4.0 .times. 105 ml-1 and > 4.0 .times. 106 ml-1. Chlorophyll concentrations were generally < 2 .mu.g liter-1 during untreated conditions and increased to as much as 50 .mu.g liter-1 during blooms. In the years following the Anabaena blooms, hypolimnetic nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in the treated basin of the lake than they were in an adjacent untreated basin or than they were before the blooms. Development of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria blooms is dependent of both a low N:P supply ratio and a sufficient phosphorus supply.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1988	33	6	1				1348	1361		10.4319/lo.1988.33.6.1348	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1988.33.6.1348													WOS:A1988T062500012

Late Quaternary stratigraphy, sedimentology and geochemistry of an underfilled lake basin in the Puna plateau (northwest Argentina)	BASIN RESEARCH												Depositional models of ancient lakes in thin-skinned retroarc foreland basins rarely benefit from appropriate Quaternary analogues. To address this, we present new stratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical analyses of four radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from the Pozuelos Basin (PB; northwest Argentina) that capture the evolution of this low-accommodation Puna basin over the past ca. 43calkyr. Strata from the PB are interpreted as accumulations of a highly variable, underfilled lake system represented by lake-plain/littoral, profundal, palustrine, saline lake and playa facies associations. The vertical stacking of facies is asymmetric, with transgressive and thin organic-rich highstand deposits underlying thicker, organic-poor regressive deposits. The major controls on depositional architecture and basin palaeogeography are tectonics and climate. Accommodation space was derived from piggyback basin-forming flexural subsidence and Miocene-Quaternary normal faulting associated with incorporation of the basin into the Andean hinterland. Sediment and water supply was modulated by variability in the South American summer monsoon, and perennial lake deposits correlate in time with several well-known late Pleistocene wet periods on the Altiplano/Puna plateau. Our results shed new light on lake expansion-contraction dynamics in the PB in particular and provide a deeper understanding of Puna basin lakes in general.

The river water had high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) and temperature had large variations at diurnal scales. As a consequence of the large variation in river temperature, the level of neutral buoyancy (the depth where the river water spreads laterally in the reservoir) oscillated between the surface (overflows) during the day, and the depth of the metalimnion (interflows) during the night. The reservoir remained strongly stratified, which favoured the presence of cyanobacteria. It is shown that under these conditions, nutrient-rich river water injected during overflows into the surface layers promoted the occurrence of localized algal blooms in the zones where the overflow mixed with the quiescent water of the reservoir. A series of hydrodynamic simulations of the reservoir were conducted both with synthetic and realistic forcing to assess the importance of river temperatures and wind-driven hydrodynamics for algal blooms. The simulations confirmed that the river inflow was the main forcing mechanism generating the localized bloom.					; Colomer, Jordi/Y-5386-2018; Marcé, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Rueda, Francisco/N-3145-2016; Marce, Rafael/H-5147-2012; Serra, Teresa/L-9279-2014; Rueda Valdivia, Francisco Jose/N-3145-2016	Colomer, Jordi/0000-0002-9330-0269; casamitjana, xavier/0000-0003-1662-9076; Marce, Rafael/0000-0002-7416-4652; Serra, Teresa/0000-0002-6075-5849; Rueda Valdivia, Francisco Jose/0000-0002-2803-3440													1015-1621					APR	2012	74	2					315	327		10.1007/s00027-011-0223-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0223-6													WOS:000302518900008

Three distinct clades of cultured heterocystous cyanobacteria constitute the dominant N2-fixing members of biological soil crusts of the Colorado Plateau, USA	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The identity of the numerically dominant N-2-fixing bacteria in biological soil crusts of the Colorado Plateau region and two outlying areas was determined using multiple approaches, to link the environmental diversity of nifH gene sequences to cultured bacterial isolates from the regions. Of the nifH sequence-types detected in soil crusts of the Colorado Plateau, 89% (421/473) were most closely related to nifH signature sequences from cyanobacteria of the order Nostocales. N-2-fixing cyanobacterial strains were cultured from crusts and their morphotypes, 16S rRNA gene and nifH gene sequences were characterized. The numerically dominant diazotrophs in the Colorado Plateau crusts fell within three clades of heterocystous cyanobacteria. Two clades are well-represented by phylogenetically and morphologically coherent strains, corresponding to the descriptions of Nostoc commune and Scytonema hyalinum, which are widely recognized as important N-2-fixing components of soil crusts. A third, previously-overlooked clade was represented by a phylogenetically coherent but morphologically diverse group of strains that encompass the morphogenera Tolypothrix and Spirirestis. Many of the strains in each of these groups contained at least two nifH copies that represent different clusters in the nifH environmental survey.

We combined this model with diel hydroacoustic measurements of depth-specific prey fish densities during summer stratification in Lake Tahoe, Lake Washington, and Strawberry Reservoir to examine differences in diel, depth-specific visual encounter rates of prey. These study sites were selected to represent gradients of increasing limnetic prey fish density and declining transparency. The model predicted over a 30-fold difference in maximum depth-specific diel encounter rates among the three lakes. Lake Washington, which was characterized by intermediate transparency and moderate limnetic prey density, had the highest predicted prey encounter rates. The pattern of prey encounter rates among the three lakes was similar to the proportional contribution of limnetic prey fishes observed in the diet of piscivores from these waters. This approach may be used to construct temporally and spatially explicit trophic interaction models for examining mechanisms underlying predator and prey distributions or to predict the response of existing or introduced predators to changing environmental conditions, prey abundance, or distribution.																			0706-652X						1999	56			1			128	139		10.1139/cjfas-56-S1-128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-S1-128													WOS:000085591600012

This particular microfauna consists of 11 species belonging to 6 genera and represents 2 distinct types of species-rich assemblages from this time interval, allowing the interpretation of the depositional setting of the fossiliferous horizon from which the samples derive. The first ostracod assemblage is mainly composed of the brackish to shallow marine species Fastigatocythere sp. Mette, 1995; Vernoniella aff. V. bajociana Bate, 1965b; Paracypris sp. A, Paracypris sp. B, Fabanella sarda Malz et al., 1985; Marslatourella aff. M. bathonica Andreu, 1999; and Fabanella aff. F. bathonica Oertli, 1957. This ostracod biofacies reflects marginal marine (shallow platform, restricted lagoon) conditions in the studied area. In contrast, the second ostracod assemblage is exclusively dominated by the non-marine limnic species Alicenula sp., Theriosynoecum pusilla Rohr, 1976; Theriosynoecum aff. T. aveyronensis Rohr, 1976; and Theriosynoecum sp. Such ostracod biofacies reflects the establishment of (a) permanent freshwater lake(s) in the studied area, triggered by the total emersion of the Bajocian Krachoua platform, presumably as response to the short-term sea-level fall event JBj3 of Haq (2017). The recognized ostracod species from the upper part of the Krachoua Formation at Kef El Anneba section (Medenine area) are particularly similar to those already described from the neighbouring sections of Kezzani (Dhaher area) and Krachoua (Tataouine area), facilitating a stratigraphic calibration of the Krachoua Formation, as well as regional correlations of the respective Bajocian continental event within the southern Tunisian palaeogeographic domain. Moreover, the biogeography of the studied ostracod microfauna from the Mid-Jurassic of southern Tunisia provides further arguments to support the hypothesis of significant biological exchanges between Laurasian and Gondwanan islands, as recently demonstrated by means of a charophyte microflora, indicating that Peri-Tethyan biogeography remained relatively uniform during that time interval and challenging the previous assumption of their endemism.					; Sames, Benjamin/GLV-0360-2022; Wagreich, Michael/D-2279-2013	Khaled, TRABELSI/0000-0003-0207-9819; Wagreich, Michael/0000-0002-8828-0857; 														2076-3263				FEB	2022	12	2							93	10.3390/geosciences12020093	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences12020093													WOS:000885251000001

Procedure I can be applied to the determination of up to 4.8 X 10(-4) M thiosulfate in the presence of sulfite and sulfide, Procedure II up to 4.8 X 10(-4) M sulfite in the presence of thiosulfate and sulfide, and Procedure III up to 6X10(-4) M sulfide in the presence of thiosulfate and sutfite. Good recoveries of thiosulfate, sulfite and sulfide from hot-spring and lake-water samples were achieved using the proposed method.																			0910-6340					JUN	1992	8	3					285	291		10.2116/analsci.8.285	http://dx.doi.org/10.2116/analsci.8.285													WOS:A1992HY44600003
J	Graham, MD; Vinebrooke, RD; Turner, M				Graham, Mark D.; Vinebrooke, Rolf D.; Turner, Michael			Coupling of boreal forests and lakes: Effects of conifer pollen on littoral communities	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Conifer pollen deposition is a visually striking spring event in boreal lakes, representing a potentially major allochthonous input of limiting nutrients. We conducted a lake survey and mesocosm experiment at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario to test the hypothesis that jack pine (Pinus banksiana) pollen inputs subsidize littoral nutrient levels and stimulate algal growth and zooplankton abundance. A series of floating litterfall collectors were deployed along transects that span a 0.27-km(2) headwater lake (Lake 373) and monitored after ice-out to quantify pollen deposition over a 45-d period. Lake 373 (L373) received 11-56 mu mol P m(-2) d(-1) from pollen, or an annual total of about 10 kg of P. These data were used to determine pollen amendment levels (ambient, 3X, 10X) for an experiment involving 18, 1-m(3) littoral mesocosms distributed over three lakes (L239, L373, and L442). Pollen amendments significantly increased total phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton biomass, resulting in greater abundance of inedible filamentous green algae and large diatoms. Pollen also exerted a positive lake-specific effect. Periphyton biomass also increased in response to pollen additions, especially filamentous green algae and diatoms in L239 and L442. Conifer pollen subsidizes nutrient levels and promotes production in small boreal takes.

The European Perch Perca fluviatilis as a Bioindicator of the Nitrogen Load to Anthropogenic Water Bodies: Toxicology and Trophology	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												In ten small anthropogenic water bodies located in the Cis-Urals, fish have been caught and water samples were taken to analyze the content of dissolved mineral forms of the nitrogen. Fluctuating asymmetry indicators of the number of pores in seismosensory canals of four paired cover head bones of European perch individuals are determined. It is found that these indicators are positively and statistically significantly related to the average nitrate content in the studied water bodies in late spring. It is also noted that the relative abundance of European perch in fish communities of these water bodies decreases with an increase in the content of dissolved mineral nitrogen. The trends are discussed in two aspects of the possible toxicological and trophological effects of nitrates on individuals of this fish species.

J	Kopyrina, L; Pshennikova, E; Barinova, S				Kopyrina, Liubov; Pshennikova, Elena; Barinova, Sophia			Diversity and ecological characteristic of algae and cyanobacteria of thermokarst lakes in Yakutia (northeastern Russia)	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												A total of 437 species (453 with infraspecific taxa) of algae and Cyanobacteria were identified in 2034 samples collected during the first research on nine thermokarst lakes in Yakutia carried out in 1986-1994 and 2001-2015. The richest algal flora was determined in Lake Aalah, represented by 241 taxa. Bacillariophyta species dominated in four lakes, whereas Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria dominated in the others. The algal bioindication demonstrated preferences for benthic and plankticbenthic life, temperate temperature, low alkalinity, waters with moderate oxygenation, low to medium enrichment with chloride, low organic pollution, and mesotrophic state. Comparative floristic, CANOCO and JASP statistical methods divided the species and environmental variables into groups of lakes related to landscape terraces. Local landscape positions and high summer water temperatures may play a major role in the formation of algal flora. The index of algae taxa per area stabilized at about 70 species per km2. The highest polymorphism of algae floras, defined by the Subspecies/Species Index, was determined for the lakes of the Tungulunskaya terrace: Lake Ynakh, Lake Nal Tungulu and Lake Tungulu (1.041-1.058), and the average total flora was 1.036. Our results can help in monitoring and protecting the ecosystems of thermokarst lakes in Yakutia in the harsh climate environment of Northeastern Eurasia.					; Barinova, Sophia/AAH-6720-2019	Barinova, Sophia/0000-0001-9915-2503; 													1730-413X	1897-3191				JUN	2020	49	2					99	122		10.1515/ohs-2020-0010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2020-0010													WOS:000541120400001

However, in practice, the relevant ecological principles about wetland restoration are often not effectively understood or applied by landscape designers, resulting in compromised ecological benefits after the restoration, especially in biodiversity and habitat benefits. The authors highlighted the main causal factors in wetland-flooding and fertility-and adopted wetland birds as indicator species to simplify the evaluation method. Based on years of practice, the authors summarized a hydrology-based wetland design method for habitat restoration, aiming to translate ecological principles and research findings into design guidelines that can be easily understood and applied by landscape designers to spatial design. This design method includes 7 steps, namely 11 targeted species selection and goal setting; 21 design of habitat types and spatial arrangement; 3) landform design; 41 water level design; 51 plant community building; 6) landscape design with minimal intervention; and 71 spatial design for natural succession. The article then expanded each step using an illustrative design case, the Qinghua Wetland in Baoshan, Yunnan Province.																			2096-336X	2095-5413				JUN	2020	8	3					90	101		10.15302/J-LAF-1-030016	http://dx.doi.org/10.15302/J-LAF-1-030016													WOS:000598076900007

Initially, the wine was made in wine press rocks excavated in outdoors rocks, near the vineyards. Once elaborated, the wine was taken to the underground cellars, being the storage the only function of the latter. Later, it was decided to ferment the must with the skins in wooden vats inside the caves, It was usual to find a press in the village for communal use, Once the wine had fermented, it was stored in wooden barrels inside the cave or the underground cellar. Later on and using the layout of the land. the owners started to build on the caves located in hills or slopes, Thus, the wooden vats of the caves were substituted by concrete man-made lakes, in which the harvest was unloaded through a window located in the back facade of the construction, falling directly onto the lake from which one can access to level zero, In this way the stone caves were unloaded with the harvest through the unloading window. falling directly onto the lake, In these lakes the red grape was pressed and the paste of skins and grapes was turned. obtaining the harvester\'s or carbonic maceration, Once the wine had been elaborated, the lake was drained through a hole placed in the lower part and with a hose the barrels in the lowest and deepest part of the cave were filled. In many of these cellars there is also an arbor press, used to obtain the pressed wine from the fermented skins. Many of these cellars kept getting higher, with the aim of placing on the upper part a family house. giving place to the house-cellars. In this way. the neighborhoods of cellars became a wine production core and an arca of social relations once the daily work in the vineyards had finished. Nowadays, in the neighborhoods of cellars there are only a few facilities that work in the wine production. Most of them have been reconverted in picnic spots or even homes, still being a meeting place.																					978-84-695-9055-3				2014							1552	1556																WOS:000376620800263

This lake has been subjected to various eutrophication control measures for the past 3 decades, including the top-down approach of planktivorous fish removal or biomanipulation. NSANN was applied for patternising the effects of pre- and post-fish removal on the phyto- and zooplankton dynamics. Results of the study have demonstrated that NSANN can: (1) elucidate short-term shifts and long-term causal relationships of complex ecological dynamics, associated with grazing, taking into account the ongoing impacts of phosphorus removal in the lake, (2) illustrate the potential impact of zooplankton grazing during the clear-water phase in spring and (3) the complex dynamics involving water quality, phyto- and zooplankton changes that take place when Daphnia peaks.

Lowbush blueberry plants formed a continuous bush cover and showed high resistance to cold. A sustainable cultivated plantation formed. Plant cover protected a peat substrate from fires; water and wind erosion, and showed a high level of berry fruit productivity during the Whole recorded period. It proves the appropriateness of the ecological-biological type of the species to the extreme weather and conditions of the experiment. However, lowbush blueberry plants showed a need for improved mineral nutrition. The implementation of these conditions is a guarantee of successful introduction of the plant on the cutover raised-bog peatlands in northern Belarus.

Dating of this event at its type locality, the Mono Basin of California, has yielded controversial results with the most recent effort concluding that the MLE may actually be the Laschamp excursion (Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 197 (2002) 151). We show that a volcanic tephra (Ash #15) that occurs near the midpoint of the MLE has a date (not corrected for reservoir effect) of 28,620+/-300 C-14 yr BP (similar to 32,400 GISP2 yr BP) in the Pyramid Lake Basin of Nevada. Given the location of Ash #15 and the duration of the MLE in the Mono Basin, the event occurred between 31,500 and 33,300 GISP2 yr BP, an age range consistent with the position and age of the uppermost of two paleointensity minima in the NAPIS-75 stack that has been associated with the MLE (Philos.

Changes in these parameters along a depth gradient can be used to distinguish a shallow water population (0.3-1.3 m depth) from a deep water population (1.8-2.3 m depth). Density of individuals decreased with depth, while biomass, size, size diversity and fertility showed the opposite pattern. The effect of ice-scour during winter together with a lower organic matter content in shallow areas are suggested as the main ecological factors responsible for these differences. Extremely high biomass values, when compared with North European populations of I. lacustris, seem to be related to a higher light availability in Pyrenean lakes. High rates of sedimentation causing burying of individuals and light depletion can explain the sharp, shallow lower boundary of the distribution of I. lacustris in Lake Baciver.

J	GORHAM, E				GORHAM, E			THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMUS LAYER IN SOME WOODLANDS OF THE ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												A study of soil properties in some woodland sites in the English Lake District reveals two very different trends in both surface and profile development, on similar parent material. Under the prevailing high rainfall, topography appears to be the main factor determining whether a flushed brown earth with a mull humus layer and ash-sycamore-oak-hazel tree community will develop, or a leached podzolic brown earth with a mor humus layer and oak, birch and rowan as the characteristic trees. In both soil series the capacity of the surface horizons to adsorb cations increases in proportion to the amount of organic matter present. In the mulls this increased capacity is largely saturated by bases, in the mors by hydrogen ions. As the humus content rises, acidity and base saturation tend to maintain a fairly constant level in the mulls, while in the mors there is a steady rise in acidity coupled with a fall in base saturation.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1953	41	1					123	152		10.2307/2257105	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2257105													WOS:A1953YD68500009

Ground Penetrating Radar in the Northern Great Lakes: A Trial Survey of a Contact Period Occupation in Marquette County, Michigan	MIDCONTINENTAL JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY												Timing, inclement weather, and limited budgets can obstruct archaeological survey efforts. Here, we ameliorate some of these with use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) at the Goose Lake Outlet (GLO#3) site (20MQ140). GPR surveys to guide survey and excavation efforts in these well-drained sandy soils are limited. GPR imagery exhibited false positives; however, shovel probes, subsequent site excavation, and artifact analysis led to numerous discoveries at this protohistoric site-including glass trade beads dating to the 1630s. These discoveries solidify evidence for some of the earliest European-made trade items in the region and provide further confirmation for placement of an Indian trail and ancient travel corridor between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. Two C-14 samples obtained from moose-bone in features with trade goods fall within the expected occupation range of 1633-1668 and 1615-1647. Several hearth clusters were seen on the GPR imagery; however, many features remained invisible.																			0146-1109	2327-4271				JAN 2	2020	45	1					1	15		10.1080/01461109.2019.1696006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01461109.2019.1696006		DEC 2019											WOS:000501633100001

Measuring and Estimating Fluxes of Carbon, Major and Trace Elements to the Arctic Ocean	NOVEL METHODS FOR MONITORING AND MANAGING LAND AND WATER RESOURCES IN SIBERIA	Springer Water											This chapter describes the methods and case studies of element flux measurements in the Arctic and subarctic rivers, in the Russian boreal and subarctic zone, along the gradient of permafrost-free terrain to continuous permafrost settings, developed on various lithology and vegetation coverage. The majority of existing flux measurements is based on a combination of daily discharges from Russian Hydrological Survey gauging stations with grab samples or year-round sampling of dissolved and particulate load following the chemical analysis. In this chapter, a new, geochemical-based perspective on the functioning of aquatic boreal systems is described which takes into account the role of the following factors on riverine element fluxes: (1) the specificity of lithological substrate; (2) the importance of organic and organo-mineral colloidal forms, notably during the spring flood; (3) the role of permafrost presence within the small and large watersheds; and (4) the governing role of terrestrial vegetation in element mobilization from rock substrate to the rivers. This kind of multiple approach allows a first-order prediction of element fluxes in a scenario of progressive warming in high latitudes. Two novel dimensions added to the existing knowledge on element transport from the land to the Arctic Ocean by the Russian boreal and subarctic rivers are (i) evaluation of colloidal flux of dissolved substances and low molecular weight (LMW) fraction and (ii) assessing, for the first time, the isotopic signatures of Ca, Mg, Si, and Fe in several case watersheds of various lithology and permafrost coverage. The results of this study and available data from the literature demonstrate that, while climate warming will certainly affect the wintertime element fluxes and speciation, it is unlikely to change the nature and magnitude of the main fraction of trace elements TE flux to the ocean. This fraction of the flux occurs in colloidal form during several weeks of the spring flood. At the present time, it is not strongly affected by climate change, or this influence is within the uncertainty of the flux measurements. Overall, the major changes in the chemical and isotopic nature of riverine fluxes to the Arctic Ocean from Northern Eurasia in a climate warming scenario are likely to be linked to the change in the vegetation (species, biomass and geographical extension), rather than temperature and hydrology. The increase in the depth of the active layer has an influence of second-order importance on the riverine fluxes given that the majority of continental flux to the Arctic Ocean is formed on permafrost soils, highly homogeneously over the depth profile.

Studies in several different environments (small scale experimental membrane arrays, pilot scale and full-sized, operational, sea water reverse osmosis, and water treatment plants) indicate that the extent of biofouling and clogging of filtration membranes is usually significantly correlated to the levels of TEP in the feedwater. Other studies have revealed that current pretreatment technology such as rapid sand filtration and microfiltration are only moderately effective in reducing the amounts of TEP in feedwater reaching reverse osmosis membranes. A revised paradigm has been proposed that takes into consideration the role of TEP microgels as important accelerators of aquatic biofilm formation. This model has applied implications for the desalination and water treatment industries. With the recognition of TEP as a critical "player" in aquatic biofilm formation, important aims for water industry R&D should be the design of improved pretreatment technologies to minimize the amounts of feedwater TEP reaching sensitive surfaces and the development of membranes that either impede surface adhesion or cause disintegration of microgels upon contact.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2013	51	4-6					1014	1020		10.1080/19443994.2012.713585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2012.713585													WOS:000313794400044

However, even in the deepest regions, oxygenation levels do not fall below 75-80% of the surface levels. This has enabled a remarkable flock of largely endemic teleost fish of the sub-order Cottoidei to colonize all depth habitats. We have previously shown that species that occupy progressively deeper habitats show a blue shift in the peak wavelength of absorbance (lambda(max)) of both their rod and cone visual pigments; for the rod pigments, a number of stepwise shifts occur from about 516 nm in littoral species to about 484 nm in abyssal species, By sequencing the rod opsin gene from 11 species of Baikal cottoids that include representatives from all depth habitats, we have been able to identify four amino acid substitutions that would account for these shifts. The effect of each substitution on lambda(max) is approximately additive and each corresponds to a particular lineage of evolution.					; Hunt, David/K-6024-2012	Fitzgibbon, Jude/0000-0002-9069-1866; Hunt, David/0000-0002-9264-3948; 													0042-6989					MAY	1996	36	9					1217	1224		10.1016/0042-6989(95)00228-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0042-6989(95)00228-6								8711901					WOS:A1996UH25300001
J	PORTER, SC; AN, ZS				PORTER, SC; AN, ZS			CORRELATION BETWEEN CLIMATE EVENTS IN THE NORTH-ATLANTIC AND CHINA DURING LAST GLACIATION	NATURE												EPISODES Of massive iceberg release (Heinrich events)(1-3) into the North Atlantic Ocean during the last glaciation were associated with recurring episodes of unusually cold North Atlantic surface water (Bond cycles)(4) and cold air temperatures over Greenland (Dansgaard-Oeschger events)(5,6). Four of the youngest of these cold events have also been reported in climate records from sites outside the North Atlantic region(7), but until now the entire suite has been identified only in North Atlantic marine sediments, Greenland ice-core records and, tentatively, in French lake sediments(8). Here we examine grain-size data from Chinese loess and intercalated accretionary palaeosols of last-glacial age for evidence of similar climate signals remote from the North Atlantic region. We see grain-size maxima with ages that match those of the last six Heinrich events, which we interpret as an indication of the changing strength of the East Asian winter monsoon, which largely controls the transport and deposition of central Asian aeolian dust. Thus it seems that these Heinrich events have left their signature in the Chinese loess record. This is consistent with simulations of the glacial climate(9), which imply that the climates of the North Atlantic and China were linked by the effect of westerly winds.

C. gibelio was fished with trammel nets with 30, 40, 45, 50, 60 mm sized meshes. The catch compositions and productivities of trammel nets and stations were determined individually and in terms of proportion and weight. During the study, the highest number of individuals was fished by nets with 40, 45, 50 mm sized meshes in Egirdir (38.14%) region. The water samples taken from the stations seasonally were analyzed. As a result of these analyses, water temperature at the stations was measured to vary between 12-16 C, pH between 8-8.95, turbidity between 1-2.31 NTU, chlorophyll -a concentration between 0.267-1.622 mg/1, dissolved oxygen between 6.86 -11.37 mg/1, and suspended matter between 25-32.1 mg/l. It was determined according to the chlorophyll -a values that Lake Egirdir has an oligotrophic structure. Spectral measurements were carried out with a spectroradiometer (ASD Fieldspec (UV/VNIR)). It was identified that the chlorophyll -a and reflection values were at the highest values at all stations (except for Hoyran) during summer and fishing yield was parallel with this.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2018	27	6					4502	4510																WOS:000437783100081
